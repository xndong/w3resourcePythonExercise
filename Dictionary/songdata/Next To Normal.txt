Diana:  
There was a time when I flew higher,  
Was a time the wild girl running free  
Would be me.  
Now I see her feel the fire,  
Now I know she needs me  
There to share  
I'm nowhere.  
  
All these blank and tranquil years  
Seems they've dried up all my tears.  
And while she runs free and fast,  
Seems my wild days are past.  
  
But I miss the mountains.  
I miss the dizzy heights.  
All the manic, magic days,  
And the dark, depressing nights.  
  
I miss the mountains,  
I miss the highs and lows,  
All the climbing, all the falling,  
All the while the wild wind blows,  
Stinging you with snow  
And soaking you with rain  
I miss the mountains,  
I miss the pain.  
  
Mountains make you crazy  
Here it's safe and sound.  
My mind is somewhere hazy  
My feet are on the ground.  
  
Everything is balanced here  
And on an even keel.  
Everything is perfect  
Nothing's real...  
Nothing's real.  
  
And I miss the mountains.  
I, I miss the lonely climb.  
Wand'ring through the wilderness.  
And spending all my time  
Where the air is clear  
And cuts you like a knife  
I miss the mountains...  
I miss the mountains...  
I miss my life.  
I miss my life.

Gabe:  
I am what you want me to be,  
And I'm your worst fear  
You'll find it in me.  
Come closer...  
Come closer...  
  
I am more than memory  
I am what might be,  
I am mystery.  
You know me  
So show me.  
  
When I appear it's  
Not so clear if  
I'm a simple spirit  
Or I'm flesh and blood...  
  
But I'm alive,  
I'm alive,  
I am so alive,  
And I feed on the fear  
That's behind your eyes.  
  
And I need you  
To need me  
It's no surprise  
I'm alive...  
So alive...  
I'm alive.  
  
I am flame and I am fire,  
I am destruction,  
Decay and desire  
I'll hurt you...  
I'll heal you...  
  
I'm your wish,  
Your dream come true,  
And I am your darkest  
Nightmare too  
I've shown you...  
I own you.  
  
And though you made me,  
You can't change me  
I'm the perfect stranger  
Who knows you too well.  
  
And I'm alive,  
I'm alive,  
I am so alive,  
And I'll tell you the truth  
If you let me try.  
  
You're alive,  
I'm alive,  
And I'll show why  
I'm alive...  
So alive...  
  
I'm alive  
I'm right behind you.  
You say forget,  
But I remind you.  
You can try to hide,  
You know that I will find you.  
'Cause if you won't grieve me  
You won't leave me behind...  
  
Ah, ah, ah,  
Whoa, oh, oh,  
Whoa, oh, oh...  
No, no, no  
I'm alive,  
I'm alive,  
I am so alive,  
If you climb on my back,  
Then we both can fly.  
  
If you try to deny me  
I'll never die  
I'm alive...  
So alive...  
I'm alive...  
Yeah, yeah...  
I'm alive...  
I'm alive...  
I'm alive...  
I'm alive!
