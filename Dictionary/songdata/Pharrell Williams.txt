Yeah, ye...spit my gum out right now...haha  
What up world? Got my insperation in the studio with me, right?...feelin' good  
Got a lot to smile about, ahaha, talk to y'all niggas...yessur, hey  
[Verse 1]  
My best friend say I'm bottled up, I need a fucking therapist  
But I can't think of nobody I wanna share this with  
Why should I open up on somebody elses carelessness...  
[cork pops] There goes the top, nigga, so here it is  
Mama workin' all day, Daddy out in the streets  
Imagine 10 years old full of doubt and defeat  
Growing up around criminals, with clout and deceat  
My grandma Loucelle used to tell me, you about what you wheap  
She used to help me with my homework, addiction-subtraction  
Added faith to my life and doubt got subtracted  
Wanna skip ya mind from crying better learn something, son  
You be beatin' on my couches, why don't you try hit the drums  
Look, oo you see me ma  
They wish they could be me ma  
As I got better, her body was eaten by Luchimia  
Seventh grade, it was cursed and sad  
But the gift within it, was when I first met Chad  
But even Chad could tell you that my Christmas was jinxed  
'cause grandma Loucelle died on 12th 19th  
I can't help but wonder, what kind of black cloud I was under  
'cause 15 years later the other died that summer...bummer  
[Chorus]  
My best friend told me, you be actin' tough, that's fine  
But the weight of the world can really crush one's mind  
So let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P
(what).  
See, you won't even know you hurt sometimes, until you in conversation it
comes out in a line so let it  
Out P (what), let it out P (what), let it out P (what), my nigga let it out  
[Verse 2]  
Aye yo, 10 21 Atlantis drive, nigga was action packed  
That's Atlantis apartments, we live in half the back  
That's where the 12 year olds there, they wbe flashing crack  
And when they shoot you nigga, they ain't tryna pass it back  
Aye yo, Diggy, Fleet and Marvian can you imagine that?  
The place we love the most, the hood was built to smash us flat  
But I escaped 'cause I chased, what made me passion that  
Now I got my skate team and spit these acid raps  
So many niggas will rise  
So many them niggas try  
So many them niggas ended up duck-taped and tied  
So many them same niggas, man they moms eyes cry  
So, they just got older, still on the corner with they pride  
Well let me tell niggas something, I'm so glad you alive  
Long as you got a breathe, a pulse, nigga strive  
Devine intervention this is  
I heard a voice nigga, listen to this  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Jesus will arange it, but Jesus won't change it  
Hold yourself responsible, on yourself you blame it  
You mad, nigga don't articulate and ??,  
I.E. we best friends, speak best friends language  
I'm a happy nigga, you can't approach me in anguish  
Whoever said anything worth working for would be painless  
Can't be mad at the world 'cause you and your girl ain't famous  
'cause you both on bate, BBC and chainless  
Also your rangless, therefore switch laneless  
Now you brainless, dangerous, 'cause you pull out the stainless  
All of sudden you smart, now you do something hainess  
First time you get caught, now your ass is famous  
No longer chainless, and the bus switching lanes is a bad look  
Yo girl with ya man sellin' laneless, Stop  
Nigga rewind and reverese slides 3 times  
Reassess your thinking and trust me it'll be fine  
First pitcure your goal, and repeat 'It'll be mine'  
Or fuck it nigga, just keep imagine killin' me fine  
Now you, scruntching your face tryna ace attainment  
When you should be tryna find a place to base your shame, nigga  
Success is taingeable, don't wait for fame  
I thought you would receive it better if I ain't say ya name  
You unsure of yourself, sit still and think  
Review those actions if it fit, put your name in the blank  
[Chorus]  
Star Track, is who we are [x4]

[Pharrell] Kweli!!!  
[T. Kweli] Yeah! They wasn't expecting this! That's why ya  
[Pharrell] Hahaha  
[T. Kweli] Gotta hope for the best and play 'em for the worst, c'mon!  
[Pharrell] Muhfuckers is history!  
[T. Kweli] C'mon!!  
  
[Verse - Talib Kweli]  
This the story of - Lucy In The Sky Wit Diamonds  
Ask her why she crying, she wanna live, she got no time for dying  
Was a science, dreams too big for a small town  
She gotta get to New York and watch a door fall down  
Hopped off the Greyhound, gotta make her way now  
She sleeping on the park benches in the playground  
But cash burn quick, don't wanna have to turn trick  
Ready to quit 'til she met the super pimp  
Flashing his toothy smile that drove little Lucy wild  
She quick to hop up on his dick straight Hoopie style  
She let the fella hit but she sang she sell-a-bit [celebate]  
He ain't buying that, she ain't selling it  
She looking for love in all of the above  
Believing videos, trying to back up all on a thug  
Who wanna - put it in her, withdraw like a Citi card  
But now she shake that ass for tips at the titty bar  
  
[Chorus - Talib Kweli] (Pharrell)  
Broken glass - everywhere! (It's louder!!)  
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air (It's louder!!)  
Try to hold back your tears baby! (It's louder!!)  
Wait a second, what happens here baby? (It's louder!!)  
Broken glass - everywhere! (It's louder!!)  
Louder - than a bomb shattered in in the air, yeah  
(How many of y'all think you can do what we do?!)  
Yeah! Wait a second (One! Two! Three! C'mon!)  
  
[Verse - Talib Kweli]  
Dreams shattered like broken glass  
Press ignore it and your hopes get broken fast  
You complain for the life you supposed to have  
But when you try to make plans God is known to laugh  
Throw a song on the phonograph, and Lucy start wilin  
The trick start smiling, watch the loot start flying  
The Gucci start pilling up, she live designer plush  
Start lining up the coke so she could find a rush  
Time's up, she's about to turn 33  
Her shit started to sag, she got surgery  
Now cats are used to drive past her like a Church van  
Acting on thirst, 'She Wants To Move' like a N. E. Are. D. Fan  
Bigger house, 10, 000 dollar purse fam  
She let you in, she wanted rent by the 1st man  
She the ring leader in a clique of birds  
And they shadowy, like the silhouette behind the curtain  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse - Talib Kweli]  
She was a small city girl with big city dreams  
Niggaz try to figure how to get up in them jeans  
Put her in them scenes, get her on the team  
Hit her wit the cream 'til they figured out the schemes  
Now she all up in the club looking for a new love  
Really like Huey Lewis looking for a new drug  
Cause coke's getting old, started free basing  
Graduated to crack, smack on occasion  
Not catching the bus, but back at the station  
Back and forth pacing, acting all impatient  
Last hundred dollars, she got to 'Get By'  
Now gotta make a choice, go home or get high  
Mommy and daddy miss her, she left for the fame  
Now what's left is the dirt that's thrown on her name  
She need a ticket home if it's the right course  
Instead she bought a ticket to ride the white horse  
  
[Chorus:]

Ladies and gentlemen,  
Yeszir,  
Let's do it!  
Yeszir,  
  
Yo, On and on and my nuts I'm palming,  
Take two of these and call me in the morning  
You should see the way the chain heart is to charmin'  
Flying like a bird like Nelly Furtado  
Shit pop ya bottles toast to screen cheers!  
Getcha 2-step cuz it's the record of the year  
Nigga that brought you ice creams 2 for a pair,  
Officially announcing that this is warfare  
Cuz back in the day my clouds was grey  
And it seemed like my angels couldn't blow them away  
But then i sold my first verse that cut the NSX  
But i was still ridin' in them thin ass jets,  
But now,  
  
My business so clear out the window of the leer  
And I'm talking on my celly all this shit that you should hear,  
Listen clearly now,  
Hello, can you hear me now?

So can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
  
On and on and this beat is zoning,  
I control the mind straight over the phone,  
Let 'em explore the words something like a tourist,  
They never get addicted unless the headywop is serious  
From Louisdales to Jimmy Choos is real,  
She knows the time she sees the richard mille,  
Flat double skeletal tourbillon  
Its just like her body move it turns her on,  
She like the way my hands use her body for hand warmers,  
And all our car doors go up like Transformers  
See i can do it thisaway i can do it thataway  
From the crib in Viginia to that new Miami getaway  
So cool like new edition that she hollas ya scent,  
I'll get it ok, let it boil away,  
But please run along, cuz ladeez is feelin wrong,  
And I got some right for 'em right after this song  
Cuz my name is Skate-Board-P

So can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
  
On and on and the temperatures warming  
I spit heat flashes, niggaz get nautious,  
Bright as a bitch  
So analyze with caution  
When the light hit the ice bet a 100 that you vomit  
Should i mention the fact the transition is the track  
No one change into the vision just to get me where I'm at  
No skateboy P too grown  
Riding up and down college in that new 2 tone  
It's so cold you dont wanna feel the chill of it, (Uh!)  
Just stand back and just look at the grill of it, (Uh!)  
I don't smoke but i bet the... love it!  
It totally intensifies vivd ass appeal of it,  
  
You could be jealous, and grit ya teeth,  
But all these little nigaas got something in reach  
  
While on my boat party trying to sunseek,  
  
Ladies and gentlemen,  
  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
Can i have it like that?  
You got it like that  
  
So, drop ya purse, and grab ya hips,  
And act like ya tryin' to get this money right quick,  
So can i have it like that?  
You got it like that

My heart is filled, with love and care  
Not an ounce of gas, I would get up there  
The answer's simple  
You lift me up  
The view up here, I see all the stars  
There go Venus, and there go Mars  
Somethin' you been through  
You're from above  
  
Hey, when I first saw you, I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it  
But I didn't know  
I didn't let go  
Then it occurred to me while tryna fight it  
Just like a kite, you learn to ride it  
But I didn't know  
You're s'posed to let it go  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me there's someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
'Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
With your love, I can board the skies  
Finding a way that electrifies, mother's your other  
Cannot stow away  
Telephone winds of the northern sky  
Is the closest thing, and here is why  
'Cause we're color  
You blow me away  
  
I need you, like I'm breathing  
Music umbrellas can make one cover  
Who cares if they don't see you?  
Don't you know that they're the same?  
I need it like I'm breathing  
If you never discover, forever you'll suffer  
Who cares if they don't see you?  
You got until then to learn the way  
  
Like a gust of wind  
You hit me off sometimes  
Like a gust of wind  
You push me back every once in a while  
Like a gust of wind  
You remind me there's someone up there  
Who whooshes in  
The air I need to power myself  
  
When I open the window  
I wanna hug you  
'Cause you remind me of the air  
I said yeah  
'Cause when I'm feelin' real low  
I remember I love you  
I put my hands in the air  
And you were there  
  
When I first saw you, I got excited  
Tried to keep my composure, tryna hide it  
But I didn't know  
I didn't let go  
Then I realized I'm tryna fight it  
Just so they can learn to ride it  
But I didn't know  
I had to let it go

My dear it seems we're here again  
So much for effort  
Isn't it clear we're here again  
Our thing right where we left it  
A delusion is a flight, first class to no where  
While a dream is a blueprint, a plane to go there  
To go there  
  
And I, I promise on all existence  
If it breathes then it is our witness  
We have unfinished business  
You and I  
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges  
With zero regret for limits  
And distance, you and I  
  
My dear it seems we're here again  
Was there a glitch in my method  
Isn't it clear we're here again  
Let's get new gpses  
So next time you see this place remember we we're alone  
We'll bring our children from home  
That's right, ohh yeah, I'm gonna go there  
  
And I, I promise on all existence  
If it breathes then it is our witness  
We have unfinished business  
You and I  
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges  
With zero regret for limits  
And distance, you and I  
  
Well, anyone think they can can do it better  
Well c'mon, c'mon  
But back to you  
Hold on girl we can make it  
Stack whatever on top I can take it  
  
It seems we're here again  
This is the right trajection  
  
And I, I promise on all existence  
If it breathes then it is our witness  
We have unfinished business  
You and I  
And so my word is that I'll cross those bridges  
With zero regret for limits  
And distance, you and I

There were flashing lights when we met  
Not the typical place you would be  
In a flash of time my mind was set

Let's do the damn thing Rell  
  
  
When girls stop and stare it's obvious it's the "Roc"  
Your vision's impaired it's obvious it's the watch  
Park nine for being pasumptious  
It could be that ash it cuts in my ear or some shit  
Oh stop your dumb shit, Hov is hot  
It ain't just hoes and guns shit, I switch top  
Big sneakers can't see wit their op-tics  
They optical allusions don't confuse dudes wit him  
Uh, it's obvious stayin' used to win  
Used to being in that Jeep deuce deuce like him  
G-4 land a teeted barrel (whoo)  
Fitted sombrero to the side, nigga my stride is so ghetto  
Projects strut, hop out the plane hop in my truck  
Just in time, hop off my thugs  
It's obvious you got hate in you thug  
You want the crown you got to take it in blood  
Nigga what! (c'mon)  
  
Wit every step, wit every move  
Scared of me, in the mood  
All I see, is her and me  
Gettin' down, I said gettin' down!  
I love her frown, I love her smile  
Most of all, I love that she's wild  
Watchin' her, watchin' me  
Escapin' to her, she's talkin' to me!  
  
  
Girl, I can tell by the look in your eyes  
And the way that you back it up  
I can tell that you like it rough rough - oh yes it's obvious!  
Plus, I'm a freak and I know it's your style  
Cause we get bubble while makin' love  
I can tell that you like it rough rough - oh yes it's obvious!  
  
It's in your walk, it's in your vibe  
In your claws, some in your eyes  
Chasin' you, you chasin' me  
We belong, like Adam and Eve  
You're the Queen, I'm the King  
Shall no one, intervene  
Kinky things, thuggish things  
Crazy things, anything!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
  
I can, I can tell  
I can, I can tell that you like it rough  
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough  
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough (I can't deny it baby!)  
I can tell, I can tell that you like it rough (so don't complicate it!)  
  
[Bridge: Rell]  
Don't complicate it (noo no)  
Be my lady (love or hate it)  
Love or hate it (nooo)  
You belong to me (babe)  
Don't complicate it (said don't complicate it)  
Be my lady (be my lady)  
Don't contemplate it (nooo nooo)  
You belong to me  
  
[Chorus] (2x)

Before you say it's cheaper to keep her  
We consider and read her  
Man, she might be the type that want P to feed her  
She wants a little cheaper, a little margarita  
Mane, them draws comin' off when she see the two-seater  
So put your Porche up, (uh)  
Get your divorce up, (uh)  
I'm sure she'll sign it when she seen me put my doors up  
Mane, them niggas only wanna mother-fucker here  
She threw her heels in the ocean, so she stuck to chill  
The trunk is still, hopin' there's something between ya  
Now she laughin' how she took your ass to the cleaners  
Mane, I'm on your side, not tryna inconvient  
Just know we got them mean keys in them plastic meaners  
So keep it player dawg,  
Don't make me say it, naw  
Do something drastic, know that plastic heavy weighing, dawg  
If it ain't music, or this money, I don't play at all  
And she ain't either, so that means she doesn't weight at all  
  
[Chorus]  
Now we can both post sip or keep it playa mane  
And we can both pull a misses, keep it playa mane  
Or we grind our wrists and keep it playa mane  
Or you can scram cocksuck if you a hater mane  
I keep 'em ladies going uh-uh-uh,  
Uh-uh-uh (haa), uh-uh-uh (yea), uh-uh-uh  
  
I'm a grown mane, Thug ain't the one to play no games with ya  
Thug the one to call and come get out the chain with ya  
And hang with ya, when ya full of Patrone  
And oh yeah, brang one of ya cute partnas along  
Because I'm only 25, and still going live  
I got the estate by the pool, by the lake outside  
I wake up and gotta pick which car I'ma drive  
The Doubble are 760, or the 645, I'm  
Havin' thangs, mane, check out the chain  
Money ain't never been a thang  
You see watch and the rang (the watch and the rang)  
Rocks the nicest, never seen nuthin' like this  
I'ma Boss I on' ask what it cost, my life priceless  
Baby girl you might just  
Get the shatter shine  
Long as you not selfish or learn to share sometimes  
And of course I'm still you'res and you're still mine  
But you can't be a hater, mane  
You gotta keep it playa, mane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say JLo shouldn't show her ass and all  
Knowin' the worst thing could happen is a nigga could palm  
Now my angent sayin' the only way that he could be calm  
I put a hundred mil on each song, like my name was LaBron (wha')  
Not the ice, my beat is worth more  
Attractive like a whole damn Jacob store  
See niggas hate you more when you take they broad  
But his girl looked in my ear and seen her matrix door  
Dude's is foolish, they hues us to chew us  
I mean, the smirfs, the green, the rocks is so bluish  
You can't out bling me, or BBC jean me  
You ain't got no vibe, you can go and ask MiMi  
I think and relay it  
I blink and P-J it  
You wanna make fast bucks, take this and Ebay it  
And all you Phantom owners know why you can't stand me  
Got one in Virigina 'nother one in Miami  
  
[Chorus]

[Refrain x2: Pharrell]  
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'  
  
[Verse 1: Pharrell]  
Bad day, at work, crazy boss, crazy or worse  
Finger, pointin', but they, they depend on you  
Inhale, exhale, in and out, like a seal  
No no, aw yes, smile honey, no stress  
  
[Chorus: Pharrell]  
[?] seems to get brighter  
Now it's good  
And the situation doesn't seem that bad  
Now it's good  
Can you imagine this started with a lighter?  
Now it's good  
Perception that you never had  
Now it's good  
  
[Refrain: Alicia Keys]  
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'  
  
[Verse 2: Alicia Keys]  
Say your name, enclave, to live life, on the edge  
Want you to know, I see, the power, is in me  
No more, [?], standin' up, with no stress  
I will do, what I need, 'til every woman on the Earth is free  
  
[Chorus: Alicia Keys]  
  
[Refrain x2: Alicia Keys]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Let me tell you all one time  
I don't mind

Feelin', feelin'  
  
[Refrain: Alicia Keys]  
  
[Verse 3: Pharrell]  
And girl don't let them tell you that you don't deserve to unwind  
And if they don't want to join us, cool, but it's our time  
We just shake our heads, and dance, the moment so surreal  
Isn't it sad? There's people in this world that don't know how this feels  
  
[Refrain x4: Both]  
I know who you are, and I know what you're feelin'

What planet are you from, girl?  
And are there others like you there?  
And could you do that magic trick again?  
Poppin' up from nowhere  
Though my planet's full of warfare  
You make it feel like a dream  
Man I hope they never find you  
  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Hot sex and gold, shiny things  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Remind you that you are a lost queen  
I think you are a lost queen  
  
I don't have a problem with multi-taskin'  
Takin' care of you is my number one passion  
Put it before my eyes, you know I'ma smash it  
Only if you want it, want it  
You don't have to ever think about askin'  
I can read your mind, girl, of course I have it  
Can I start you up? It's automatic  
Get your motor runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom  
I'm never too busy to tell you that you're pretty  
Ain't gotta ask me to  
Surprise you in the city when your day is goin' shitty  
Ain't gotta ask me to  
  
What planet are you from, girl?  
And are there others like you there?  
And could you do that magic trick again?  
Poppin' up from nowhere  
Though my planet's full of warfare  
You make it feel like a dream  
Man I hope they never find you  
  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Hot sex and gold, shiny things  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Remind you that you are a lost queen  
I think you are a lost queen  
  
I don't need momma and daddy  
Honey and sugar, man I bet they're so classy  
Half of me is good, the other half nasty  
Can't help it if I want it, want it  
Sure I meet your friends on my best behavior  
Talk about relationships, I used to be a player  
And like Geico, the time I saved 'em  
And get their motors runnin', runnin', vroom-vroom  
Lift your head when you're down so you don't drop your crown  
Ain't gotta ask me to  
And right before we finish, I'll ask you did you get it  
Ain't gotta ask me to  
  
What planet are you from, girl?  
And are there others like you there?  
And could you do that magic trick again?  
Poppin' up from nowhere

Man I hope they never find you  
  
I think you are a lost queen  
Let me serve you, serve you  
Hot sex and gold, shiny things

Different, oh yeah, yeah  
This one goes out to all the lovers  
What can we do? We're helpless romantics  
We can not help who we're attracted to  
So let's all dance, and elevate each other  
  
Dear diary, it's happenin' again  
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win  
I just close my eyes and visions appear  
She's everything I want, and it's crystal clear  
Not even Marilyn Monroe  
Who Cleopatra please  
Not even Joan of Arc  
That don't mean nothin' to me  
I just want a different girl  
Girl, girl, girl, girl  
Girl, girl, can't another good boy keep it this thorough  
  
Why, why do I have to lie  
Pretend, make believe or hide her?  
When I love what I've described  
But then again, I don't need no adjectives for this girl  
  
Dear diary, it's happenin' again  
This energy, like I'm 'bout to win

What's wrong with that? Yeh  
What's wrong with that?  
What's wrong with that?  
  
In honor of the groove and all who's surrendered to it  
We say thank you, and we take it back  
  
Wished so hard, I wished so hard that it came true  
Then my lucky star, I guess you came from behind the moon  
I put my arms around her, and I promise not to abuse you  
Since now I found you, why the hell would I want to lose you?

Our Father, which art in heaven  
I'm so grateful  
Of all the beautiful things  
That you are allowing me to see  
Birds, bees  
The ability to do what I do  
The opportunities  
I know you love me now  
And I think it's time  
And my duty,to tell the world (Jesus is my daddy I'm tellin' you,oh)  
  
Don't let me fall  
You watch for who I'm friends with  
I got tattoos ,you forgive me  
You know I'm so sensitive  
You know I'm chased by women  
You know mt mind is drivin'  
To you my heart is givin', oowww  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the greatest  
You're the greatest (wow wow)  
You're the greatest (Jesus is my daddy I'm telling you)  
You're the greatest  
Don't let me fall  
  
They don't understand  
What you do for me (do foe me)  
And nothing by my actions  
They don't I believe (I believe)  
Not talking 'bout what I wear  
When I drivin' where I sleep  
I mean the ability to hear, feel and sleep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Thank you for my brothers  
Thank you for my daddy (daddy)

(Pharrell Verse 1)  
You're that girl  
[Who] thinks the world  
Is somethin beautiful  
And that's all baby  
But your lookin for a brawn  
with shed upon the wrong star  
Cause it don't know  
That's not how it goes  
So, I can't explain, why things are made the same and others change  
He made it that way  
But the perplexities of world  
Leaves more oysters and pearls  
And I don't know  
It's just the way it goes (But i know you can)  
  
Stay with me  
Lock the door  
Take the key  
Hide yours  
Feel the bate  
Hear the choice  
Hear the choice  
Hear the choice (Hey!)  
  
(Pharrell Verse 2)  
  
Don't take the time  
To relax your mind  
So unusual (ooh baby)  
But your priorities are disheveled  
But your emotions and your health just don't go  
Your body says no, So  
I can't concieve  
That leaves will grow on trees in loweth degrees  
and comeback next spring  
But the perplexities of life  
Brings more days that bore new skies  
So whose to know, possible (that you could)  
  
Chorus  
  
(Pharrell Verse 3)  
Up, up and away  
I be the wind that blows yourself  
The pixie dust of tinkerbell  
Up, up and away  
I be the wind beneath your wings  
Living color comes with you  
  
(Pusha T Verse)  
Baby let's it pour it up  
Let them galardo doors up  
Pat eve for them louis as soon as the tours up  
The million dollar frame is his and her the same  
I took it on the chin when i heard about the lane  
I ain't here to try to rewrite your past (Naw)  
That don't measure up to the nights that we laughed  
When considering love you take the Good with the bad  
I've been disappointed by every bitch i ever had  
Either she was dick crazy or cheddar mad  
Shame what they did for them jeans and them leather bags  
Reverse it I want perfect  
That was half the reason i bought half them purses  
That chapter is over, it was worth it, my My new angel surface, she ain't have
to rehearse ,My baby's real (Yep)  
That's why i put the chill on her  
So good make a nigga wanna kneel on her, not yet  
  
Chorus  

Pharrell:]  
we do this in our sleep niggaz  
Yessir  
  
[Snoop:]  
U eva been in love b4?  
Let me holla at u mann  
U know it's hard for a playa to admit that sumtimes  
But I'm a spit that sumtimes  
U know wat I'm sayin'  
Ay p, give it to em one time, nephew  
  
[Pharrell nd Charlie:]  
There's sumthin bout this girl  
From around my way  
Ever try to hold back ur feelings,  
But it just wouldn't stay?  
But when I finally found the words to say  
I wanted to run away  
Simply run away  
  
[Pharrell:]  
U can try to run and hide  
It wont make a difference  
U can lie to urself  
Of the reason  
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention  
That ur in love with the girl  
  
Yessir, that's her  
But it wasn't like that back wen I met her  
The lavish life from all the do? spun  
Before the RR had the hitchhike thumb  
Her friends didn't like niggaz like us but i  
Arrested the coochie and her feelings got cuffed  
Spiderweb sex, must'a got caught up  
But there's more to it  
I remember once  
Sayin' let's shit on the peons  
Let's go ta vegas nd watch celine dion  
Make em say 'wat we on??  
U say no like u was doin it for eons  
Fuck it, I'll just hum and let the watch give off the neons  
Wen it rains it pours  
I laughs to myself wen I change the score  
U said my sex was a lot but my brain gave u more  
And sumn bout how ya ex was a toy  
I guess he played games  
There's only diamond dice here  
Not tryin ta justify  
But wen ya shut ya eye u can touch the sky  
U in trouble ma  
And u should pray about speed  
But if this bout u  
Wat that say about me?  
  
[Pharrell and Charlie:]  
But when I finally found the words to say  
I wanted to run away  
Simply run away  
  
[Pharrell:]  
U can try to run and hide  
It wont make a difference  
U can lie to urself  
Of the reason  
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention  
That ur in love with the girl  
  
[Snoop:]  
See I'm a crip in dark blue chucks  
And I does wat I does  
Yea I might say 'cuz?  
It's really weird cuz a nigga got love  
Snoop Dogg's a crip and the girl was a blood (what??)  
She told me that her baby-daddy was a thug  
Now it is wat it is and it was how it was  
I'm hollin lil mama like wat  
Money mo stacked tryin ta get my g's back  
All these memories breed seeds of a rhythm rhyme pleaser  
Laid back while we sippin on a breeza  
Fresh 4-pack sittin in the freeza  
Ain't that kadeeja? I heard she was a Skeeza?  
She used ta hit them licks wit the Beezas  
Wen I seen her wit the homies, I was like ?JESUS!?  
It's been a lil min since I seen her  
Hope her man don't run up cuz ill have to pull the neena  
  
[Pharrell and Charlie:]  
There's sumthin bout this girl  
From around my way  
Ever try to hold back ur feelings,  
But it just wouldn't stay?  
But when I finally found the words to say  
I wanted to run away  
Simply run away  
  
[Pharrell and Charlie:]  
U can try to run and hide  
It wont make a difference  
U can lie to urself  
Of the reason  
Sure it hurts wen it comes to ur attention  
That ur in love with the girl

[Chorus - Pharrell]  
Where's yours at  
Where's yours at  
Where's yours at  
Come on, hah, come on, hah  
Come on, hah, come on, hah  
Come on, hah, come on, hah  
Come on, hah, come on, hah, come on  
  
[Verse 1 - Pharrell]  
Yeah I'ma skater, yeah I'm dirty  
Lookin' for my wife, while they smart and perty  
Your material-listic, journey  
That bullshit, don't concern me  
Ah, here you go, talking big shit  
You ain't think, I could flip it like this quick  
You just talking, and I'm the big shit  
Without mentioning my hit list, for instance  
Color dunk show, got 'em all yo  
Got a different car, under each garage do'  
From the Rolls Royce, that rides like hydro  
That white 550, nigga, kicking like Tae Bo  
I don't give a fuck, what ya haters think  
Fam' I did things, my major means  
At a pretty young age, I did major things  
I made major cream, I eat major greens  
First the yellow diamonds nigga, made ya bling  
Had the baddest bitches, on the major scene  
Fuck what ya heard and what you think you seen  
I fuck that bitch who come from Cover Girl, to Maybelline  
Quater million jewelry from, Las Van Dome  
Diamonds and plat', like glass and chrome  
Black credit card, just asking on  
Didn't need it, just didn't have it home  
White girl in Africa, Black in Rome  
Philipina girl, just packing at home  
All the girls I get, I hack and moan  
Man I give 'em the dick, you know them bitches just gone  
Nigga raise ya funds, been crazier son  
But nigga ignorant, and Star Trak, take his fun  
I'm the keyboard killer, with the raz-or toungue  
Don't come back tellin me, what play-ers done  
I did it big, and I made it fun  
I made a ton, oh yeah the Rolls Royce got sacadelic flowers  
Painted on it, and I'm leaning on a nigga wit a lazor gun  
The house in Virginia, that's what I'm living in  
Building in Carribean, fillin 'em and buildin' 'em  
"Paris too?" said the strangest girl  
I said bitch, I'm tryna change the world, whoo  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2 - Rohff]  
Mc tu fais pas le poids, this moi tu vas faire quoi  
C'est la K'1 Fry Mafia, ceux qui t'ont montr? L'pas  
Mc qu'on ne contr? Le pas, mc qu'on ne compare pas  
Qu'on? Coute au car-pla, que les keufs ne blairent pas  
Pour Sarko on est bon qu'? Porter la cagoule et les gants  
Star-co dans les mariages on est les plus? L? Gants  
Charme du ghetto, sur les photos  
Joue les pachs, J'serre des tis-m? S (???)  
Roule en Smart, J'raconte que d'la merde  
Elle s'marre, font des smacks  
On aime celles qui se respectent, car l'respect commence par soit m? Me  
Celles qui s'prennent pas la t? Te, qui couchent le soir m? Me  
On est bizarres, ma vie un bazar  
Armdullah, j'suis artiste comme Mozart  
Les mcs j'smoke, le rap c'est comme  
La prostitution, ? A s'mac, Dan's l'show buis'  
Font tous la bise, S'appellent " ch?ri "  
On vient tout niquer sur l'terrain, la France-Alg? Rie  
Ton boss Rohff dans la place, prot? Ge ta garce  
Reconna? T le flow, la classe de celle qui fracasse  
Sur un gros son "Neptunes" issu de l'espace  
Issu du bitume, donne moi mes tunes, j'suis un rapace  
Partout o? On passe, C'est d'la casse, L'air ne repousse pas  
Ceux qui jactent dans les s'ringues ou crosses des lance-bas  
A bout portant, on shoot la concurrence  
T'entend pas l'ambulance, pam-pam-pam  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge - Rohff]  
M. A. C. Are. O-cun  
Mc d? Chire? A comme moi  
Give it up, give it up  
Say give it up, give it up  
  
[Bridge - Girl]  
G. I. Are. L  
Aucune meuf donne? A comme moi  
Get it up, get it up  
Get it up, get it up  
  
[Chorus:]
