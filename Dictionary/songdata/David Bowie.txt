It's just a one dollar secret  
A lover's secrets in the UK  
Torn apart in the UK  
In the dribble of May-Day  
'87 and Cry  
'87 and Cry  
And there's nothing inside  
And there's nothing in mind  
And only you  
Rocket on through the sky  
It couldn't be done without dogs  
It couldn't be once without us  
'87 and Cry  
'87 and Cry  
  
When the days were the days were the days boys  
When blue ties were for the biggy guys  
Frannie dressing down for the enemy  
You saw him hangin' on the enemy  
And there's no one in love  
And there's nowhere to scream  
And only you  
Race on to wonder where  
It couldn't be done without dogs  
It couldn't be once without us  
'87 and Cry  
'87 and Cry  
You can't make love with money  
You can't make mistakes with babies  
Nothing looked good on you  
That's how I liked you best  
Now you're ready for the real McCoy  
  
Deep in the heart of Cupid  
Murders on the heels of love  
Just the ghost of a story  
Just a one dollar secret  
Baby these were the sounds  
Baby these were the sounds  
And only you  
Whisper these things aren't true  
It couldn't be done with dogs  
It couldn't be once without us  
'87 and Cry  
'87 and Cry

Please don't tear this world asunder  
Please take back  
This fear we're under  
I demand a better future  
  
Or I might just stop wanting you  
I might just stop wanting you  
Please make sure we get tomorrow  
All this pain and all the sorrow  
  
I demand a better future  
Or I might just stop needing you  
I might just stop needing you  
Give my children sunny smile  
  
Give them moon and cloudless sky  
I demand a better future  
Or I might just stop loving you,  
Loving you, loving you  
  
When we talk, we talk to you  
When we walk, we walk to you  
From factory to field  
How many tears must fall  
  
Down there below  
Nothing is moving  
Oh  
I might just stop wanting you  
  
I might just stop needing you  
I might just stop loving you  
I demand a better future  
I demand a better future  
  
I demand a better future  
For I might just stop loving you,  
Loving you, loving you  
I demand a better future  
  
I demand a better future  
I demand a better future  
For I might just stop loving you, loving you, loving you  
I demand a better future

Poor soul  
Spit upon that  
Poor soul  
He never knew what hit him  
And it hit him so  
  
Poor dunce  
He pushed back the pigmen  
The Barbs laughed  
The fool is dead  
  
Poor dunce  
He's less than within us  
The brains talk  
But the will to live is dead  
And prayer can't travel so far these days  
The talk of your life  
Standing so near  
To innocent eyes  
Poor dunce  
  
Swings through the tunnels  
And claws his way  
Is small life so manic  
Are these really the days  
  
Poor dunce  
Poor dunce  
  
Poor soul  
Poor soul  
Poor soul

I've nothing much to offer  
There's nothing much to take  
I'm an absolute beginner  
And I'm absolutely sane  
As long as we're together  
The rest can go to hell  
I absolutely love you  
But we're absolute beginners  
With eyes completely open  
But nervous all the same  
  
If our love song  
Could fly over mountains  
Could laugh at the ocean  
Just like the films  
There's no reason  
To feel all the hard times  
To lay down the hard lines  
It's absolutely true  
  
Nothing much could happen  
Nothing we can't shake  
Oh we're absolute beginners  
With nothing much at stake  
As long as you're still smiling  
There's nothing more I need  
I absolutely love you  
But we're absolute beginners  
But if my love is your love  
We're certain to succeed  
  
If our love song  
Could fly over mountains  
Sail over heartaches  
Just like the films  
There's no reason  
To feel all the hard times  
To lay down the hard lines  
It's absolutely true

Words are flowing out like  
Endless rain into a paper cup  
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe.  
Pools of sorrow waves of joy  
Are drifting through my opened mind  
Possessing and caressing me.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Images of broken light, which  
Dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a  
Restless wind inside a letter box  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva. Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
  
Sounds of laughter, shades of life  
Are ringing through my opened ears  
Inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless undying love, which  
Shines around me like a million suns,  
It calls me on and on across the universe  
  
Jai Guru Deva.  
Jai Guru Deva.  
Jai Guru Deva.  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world  
Nothing's gonna change my world

I wish I was smarter  
I got so lost on the shore  
I wish I was taller  
Things really matter to me  
  
But I put my face in tomorrow  
I believe we're not alone  
I believe in Beatles  
I believe my little soul has grown  
And I'm still so afraid  
  
Yes, I'm still so afraid  
Yea, I'm still so afraid on my own  
On my own  
What made my life so wonderful?  
What made me feel so bad?  
I used to wake up the ocean  
I used to walk on clouds  
If I put faith in medication  
If I can smile a crooked smile  
If I can talk on television  
If I can walk an empty mile  
Then I won't feel afraid  
No, I won't feel afraid  
I won't be Be afraid  
Anymore  
Anymore  
Anymore

Please trip them gently, they don't like to fall, Oh by jingo  
There's no room for anger, we're all very small, Oh by jingo  
We're painting our faces and dressing in thoughts from the skies, from
paradise  
But they think that we're holding a secretive ball.  
Won't someone invite them  
They're just taller children, that's all, after all  
  
Man is an obstacle, sad as the clown, Oh by jingo  
So hold on to nothing, and he won't let you down, Oh by jingo  
Some people are marching together and some on their own  
Quite alone  
Others are running, the smaller ones crawl  
But some sit in silence, they're just older children  
That's all, after all  
  
I sing with impertinence, shading impermanent chords,  
With my words  
I've borrowed your time and I'm sorry I called  
But the thought just occurred that we're nobody's children at all, after all  
  
Live your rebirth and do what you will, Oh by jingo  
Forget all I've said, please bear me no ill, Oh by jingo  
After all, after all

Watching him dash away, swinging an old bouquet - dead roses  
Sake and strange divine Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh you'll make it  
Passionate bright young things, takes him away to war - don't fake it  
Sadden glissando strings  
Uh-h-h-uh-h-uh - you'll make it  
  
Who'll love Aladdin Sane  
Battle cries and champagne just in time for sunrise  
Who'll love Aladdin Sane  
  
Motor sensational, Paris or maybe hell - I'm waiting  
Clutches of sad remains  
Waits for Aladdin Sane - you'll make it  
  
Who'll love Aladdin Sane  
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise  
Who'll love Aladdin Sane  
  
We'll love Aladdin Sane  
Love Aladdin Sane  
  
Who'll love Aladdin Sane  
Millions weep a fountain, just in case of sunrise  
Who'll love Aladdin Sane  
  
We'll love Aladdin Sane  
We'll love Aladdin Sane

Day after day  
They send my friends away  
To mansions cold and grey  
To the far side of town  
Where the thin men stalk the streets  
While the sane stay underground  
  
Day after day  
They tell me I can go  
They tell me I can blow  
To the far side of town  
Where it's pointless to be high  
'Cause it's such a long way down  
  
So I tell them that  
I can fly, I will scream, I will break my arm  
I will do me harm  
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall  
I'm not quite right at all...am I?  
  
Don't set me free, I'm as heavy as can be  
Just my librium and me  
And my E.S.T. makes three  
  
'Cause I'd rather stay here  
With all the madmen  
Than perish with the sad men roaming free  
And I'd rather play here  
With all the madmen  
For I'm quite content they're all as sane  
As me  
  
(Where can the horizon lie  
When a nation hides  
Its organic minds  
In a cellar...dark and grim  
They must be very dim)  
  
Day after day  
They take some brain away  
Then turn my face around  
To the far side of town  
And tell me that it's real  
Then ask me how I feel  
  
Here I stand, foot in hand, talking to my wall  
I'm not quite right at all  
  
Don't set me free, I'm as helpless as can be  
My libido's split on me  
Gimme some good 'ole lobotomy  
  
'Cause I'd rather stay here  
With all the madmen  
Than perish with the sad men  
Roaming free  
And I'd rather play here  
With all the madmen  
For I'm quite content  
They're all as sane as me

Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school  
They ain't said I broke no rule  
I ain't never been in Dutch  
I don't browse around too much  
Don't bother me, leave me alone  
Anyway I'm almost grown  
I don't run around with no mob  
Got myself a little job  
I'm gonna buy me a little car  
Drive my girl in the park  
Got my eye on a little girl  
Ah, she's really out of this world  
When I take her to the dance  
She's got to talk about romance  
You know I'm still livin' in town  
But I done married and settled down  
Now I really have a ball  
So I don't browse around at all  

Every chance, every chance that I take  
I take it on the road  
Those kilometers and the red lights  
I was always looking left and right  
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car  
  
Jasmine, I saw you peeping  
As I pushed my foot down to the floor  
I was going round and round the hotel garage  
Must have been touching close to 94  
Oh, but I'm always crashing in the same car  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah

Hey-hey it's the tall sail  
On a beach reach for java  
Make way for to Java  
Watching for Boogies  
Hey-hey it's a dreaming  
I would burn you if you should die  
Hey-hey I would burn too  
If you should lie upon that bamboo pyre  
  
[Chorus]  
I dream of Amlapura  
Never saw in all my life a more shining jewel  
I dream of Amlapura  
Of an ocean or dream of a princess in stone  
  
Hey-hey golden roses around  
A rajah's mouth  
Hey-hey all the dead children buried standing  
A flying Dutchman  
Smoking gun and spice wind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I dream of Amlapura  
Of a princess in stone  
Hey-hey it's a tall ship  
Hey-hey  
Hey-hey  
Amlapura

In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who sings  
Of the dreams that he brings  
From the wide open sea  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who sleeps  
While the river bank weeps  
To the old Willow tree  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who dies  
Full of beer, full of cries  
In a drunken town fight  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who's born  
On a hot muggy morn  
By the dawn's early light  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
Where the sailors all meet  
There's a sailor who eats  
Only fish heads and tails  
And he'll show you his teeth  
That have rotted too soon  
That can haul up the sails  
That can swallow the moon  
  
And he yells to the cook  
With his arms open wide  
"Hey, bring me more fish  
Throw it down by my side"  
And he wants so to belch  
But he's too full to try  
So he stands up and laughs  
And he zips up his fly  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
You can see sailors dance  
Paunches bursting their pants  
Grinding women to porch  
They've forgotten the tune  
That their whiskey voice croaked  
Splitting the night  
With the roar of their jokes  
And they turn and they dance  
And they laugh and they lust  
Till the rancid sound of the accordion bursts  
And then out of the night  
With their pride in their pants  
And the sluts that they tow  
Underneath the street lamp  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
There's a sailor who drinks  
And he drinks and he drinks  
And he drinks once again  
He'll drink to the health  
Of the whores of Amsterdam  
Who've given their bodies  
To a thousand other men  
Yeah, they've bargained their virtue  
Their goodness all gone  
For a few dirty coins  
When he just can't go on  
Throws his nose to the sky  
Aims it up above  
And he pisses like I cry  
On the unfaithful love  
  
In the port of Amsterdam  
In the port of Amsterdam

I recall how we lived  
On the corner of a bed  
And we'd speak of a Swedish room  
Of hessian and wood  
And we'd talk with our eyes  
Of the sweetness in our lives  
And tomorrows of rich surprise...  
Some things we could do  
  
In our madness  
We burnt one hundred days,  
Time takes time to pass  
And I still hold some ashes to me,  
An Occasional Dream.  
  
And we'd sleep, oh so close,  
But not really close our eyes  
'Tween the sheets of summer bathed in blue...  
Gently weeping nights  
It was long, long ago  
And I can't touch your name.  
For the days of fater were strong for you...  
Danced you far from me.  
  
In my madness  
I see your face in mine.  
I keep a photograph  
It burns my wall with time  
Time,  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.  
An occasional dream  
Of mine.

(This is Andy Warhole and it's take one, take one)  
It's, it's Warhol actually  
(What did I say)  
Whole, it's whole as in wholes  
(Andy Warhol)  
Wah, Andy War hol, Andy War hol (he)  
Like whole hub  
He  
Ha  
Are you ready  
(Yeah)  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha  
  
Like to take a cement fix  
Be a standing cinema  
Dress my friends up just for show  
See them as they really are  
Put a peephole in my brain  
Two New Pence to have a go  
I'd like to be a gallery  
Put you all inside my show  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen  
Can't tell them apart at all  
  
Andy walking, Andy tired  
Andy take a little snooze  
Tie him up when he's fast asleep  
Send him on a pleasant cruise (hm hm hm)  
When he wakes up on the sea  
He sure to think of me and you  
He'll think about paint and he'll think about glue  
What a jolly boring thing to do  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen  
Can't tell them apart at all  
  
Andy Warhol looks a scream  
Hang him on my wall  
Andy Warhol, Silver Screen  
Can't tell them apart at all

I can go anyway (way I choose)  
I can live anyhow (win or lose)  
I can go anywhere (for something new)  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose  
  
I can do anything (right or wrong)  
I can talk anyhow (and get along)  
I don't care anyway (I never lose)  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose  
  
Nothing gets in my way  
Not even locked doors  
Don't follow the lines that been laid before  
I get along anyway I care  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere  
  
I can go anyway (way I choose)  
I can live anyhow (win or lose)  
I can go anywhere (for something new)  
Anyway, anyhow, anywhere I choose

Anyway, anyway I choose

Do you remember a guy that's been  
In such an early song  
I've heard a rumor from Ground Control  
Oh no, don't say it's true  
  
They got a message from the Action Man  
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too  
I've loved all I've needed to love  
Sordid details following"  
  
The shrieking of nothing is killing  
Just pictures of Jap girls in synthesis and I  
Ain't got no money and I ain't got no hair  
But I'm hoping to kick but the planet it's glowing  
  
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky  
We know Major Tom's a junkie  
Strung out in heaven's high  
Hitting an all-time low  
  
Time and again I tell myself  
I'll stay clean tonight  
But the little green wheels are following me  
Oh no, not again  
I'm stuck with a valuable friend  
"I'm happy, hope you're happy too"  
One flash of light but no smoking pistol  
  
I never done good things I never done bad things  
I never did anything out of the blue, woh-o-oh  
Want an axe to break the ice  
Wanna come down right now  
  
Ashes to ashes, funk to funky  
We know Major Tom's a junkie  
Strung out in heaven's high  
Hitting an all-time low  
  
My mother said to get things done  
You'd better not mess with Major Tom

I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel  
No one looks and no one feels  
But the baby can, the baby can  
The way it feels just feeling you  
Holding out and falling out  
But the baby can, the baby can  
I'm the jumping man  
I'm the jumping man  
But baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
You're going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down  
I'm the shadow man, the jumping jack  
The man who can and don't look back  
But the baby can, the baby can  
I'm rolling out of the ferris wheel  
No one looks and no one feels  
But the baby can, the baby can  
And the way it feels  
I'm feeling you  
The baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
You're going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down  
Every day is far away  
Every day, every day  
It's over now  
It's over now  
It's over now  
It's over now  
It's over now  
It's over now  
But baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
You're going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down  
Baby can float  
Baby can drown  
Baby can touch her toes  
Toss her hair  
Makes you feel  
You're going nowhere  
Baby can dance  
Baby can dance  
Baby can walk around the town  
Attract a man and cut him down  

Test, testing, testing  
This, hmmm, Grace is my name  
And and I was... Hm...  
It was that phot... A fading photograph of  
A patch, a patchwork quilt.  
And they've put me on these  
Ramona put me on these interest drugs  
So I'm thinking bit too fast like a brain hatch  
And ah they won't let me see anybody  
If I want to sometimes and I ask  
I can hear some pop... Popular musics  
And aftershocks. (Sneeze)  
See I've been watching a television of um... In the homelands  
That's the new homelands and um that's all I can remember  
And now they just want me to be quiet  
And I think something is going to be horrid.

[Baby loves that way]  
Yes, she does, yes, she does  
[Baby loves that way]  
Oh, I love my baby

Ooh, I gotta take her  
[Baby loves that way]  
Yep, I love her  
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her  
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her  
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad  
But fooling around, it will make me sad  
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy  
[Baby loves that way]  
Oh, I love my baby  
[Baby loves that way]  
Ooh, she does too much to me  
[Baby loves that way]  
And I can't think too much of her  
[Baby loves that way]  
Gotta take her, gotta take her  
Gonna better leave her alone, put you down son  
Treating her real fine, thus I'm home being a loner  
Jeanny's my babe and that's alright, yeah  
She treats me good, each and every night  
She fools around with other boys and treat me like an unwanted toy  
[Baby loves that way]  
I love my baby  
[Baby loves that way]  
Ooh, she's too much  
[Baby loves that way]  
Yes she does, yes she does

Yeah, she's too much, yeah yeah

Ooh, I think she can live with me  
[Baby loves that way]  
Love her, love her, love her  
Baby likes to go outside, so I let her  
Wants to fool with other guys, so I let her  
Wants to be bad, so I let her be bad  
But fooling around, it will make me sad  
She clings around with all the boys, who treat her like unwanted toys  
[Baby loves that way]  
Obviously this is the end  
[Baby loves that way]  
Gotta take her  
[Baby loves that way]  
Ooh yeah  
[Baby loves that way]  
Can't do enough  
[Baby loves that way]  

Sickened by sun, with rainstorms lashing him rotten  
A looted wreath crowning his tangled hair  
Every moment of his youth apart from its dream was forgotten  
Gone the roof overhead, but the sky was always there  
Oh you, who are flung out, alike from heaven and from Hades  
You murderers who've been so bitterly repaid  
Why did you part from the mothers who nursed you as babies  
It was peaceful and you slept and there you stayed  
Still he explores and rakes the absinthe green oceans  
Though his mother has given him up for lost  
Grinning and cursing with a few odd tears of contrition  
Always in search of that land where life seems best  
Loafing through hells and flocked through paradises  
Calm and grinning, with a vanishing face  
At times he still dreams of a small field he recognises  
With a blue sky overhead and nothing else  
  

Wow this ain't the right thing to do so let's go  
  
Young girls they know what they're after  
Young girls don't kiss me goodbye  
Rockets shooting up into space  
Buildings they rise to the skies  
  
Bang Bang I got mine  
Bang Bang reach for the sky  
  
I keep a good friend on videotape  
He'll drive his sports car until it's too late  
But we'll have a hot time on the town tonight  
Cause love is my bet and it's the best yet  
  
Bang Bang I got mine  
Bang Bang sun don't shine  
Bang Bang you all angels  
Bang Bang now you all ought to be in pictures  
  
Oh girl  
Oh girl my problems can't follow me  
Phone calls I take my machine  
I wander lonely to the sea  
Lonely-Ha Ha-what does it mean  
  
Bang Bang I got mine  
Bang Bang and you are next in line  
Bang Bang reach for the sky  
Bang Bang sun don't shine  
  
Rise buildings  
Rise to the sky  
Young girls they know what they're after  
I said, young girls don't kiss me goodbye

Photograph king, watches you go  
Fashions may change, heaven knows, but you still leave a stain on me  
  
Supplement queen, your colours may fade  
Seasons may change, weather blows, but you still leave a mark on me  
  
Wrong-negative fades-never the twain, reckless and tame  
  
I like the beat of your drum  
I like to look in your eyes  
I like to look through your things  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
  
I like the smell of your flesh  
I like the dirt that you dish  
I like the clothes that you wear  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
  
Disco brat-follow the pack  
Watching you peel, heaven knows, prison can't hold all this greedy intention  
  
Vanity's child-picture you now  
Music may change-hi-di-ho keen to follow your nose  
  
Wrong-love out of tune  
Sweet is the night, bright light destroys me  
  
I like the beat of your drum  
I like to look in your eyes  
I like to look through your things  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
  
I like the smell of your flesh  
I like the dirt that you dish  
I like the clothes that you wear  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
I like your face in the crowd  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
I'd like to beat on your drum  
I'd like to blow on your horn  
I'd like to beat on your drum

Psychodelicate girl  
Come out to play  
Little metal faced-boy  
Don't stay away  
They're so war-torn and resigned  
She can't talk anymore  
What are they trying to prove?  
What would they like to find?  
  
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)  
These pieces are broken (like I say)  
These pieces are broken  
Hope I'm wrong but I know  
  
CHORUS  
Because you're young  
You'll meet a stranger some night  
Because you're young  
What could be nicer for you  
And it makes me sad  
So I'll dance my life away  
A million dreams, a million scars  
  
He punishes hard  
Was loving her such a crime  
She took back everything she said  
Left him nearly out of his mind  
They're people I know  
People I love  
They seem so unhappy  
Dead or alive  
  
It's love back to front and no sides (like I say)  
These pieces are broken (like I say)  
These pieces are broken  
Hope I'm wrong but I know  
  
CHORUS  
  
A million dreams  
A million scars  
A million (repeat ad inf.)

Don't talk of dust and roses  
Or should we powder our noses?  
Don't live for last year's capers  
Give me steel, give me steel, give me pulses unreal  
  
He'll build a glass asylum  
With just a hint of mayhem  
He'll build a better whirlpool  
We'll be living from sin, then we can really begin  
  
Please savior, savior, show us  
Hear me, I'm graphically yours  
  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool us, someone like you  
  
We want you Big Brother, Big Brother  
  
I know you think you're awful square  
But you made everyone and you've been every where  
Lord, I think you'd overdose if you knew what's going down  
  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool us, someone like you  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool, someone like you  
Someone to claim us, someone to follow  
Someone to shame us, some brave Apollo  
Someone to fool, someone like you  
  
We want you Big Brother

Getting my facts from a Benneton ad  
I'm lookin' through African eyes  
Lit by the glare of an L.A. fire  
I've got a face, not just my race, Bang Bang I've got you babe  
  
Sun comes up and the man goes down  
And the woman comes again  
Just an hour or so to be safe from fear  
Then we jump through hoops, we're divisable now, just disappear  
  
We reach out over race and hold each other's hands  
Then die in the flames singing "we shall overcome"  
Whoa! What's going on?  
There'll be some blood no doubt about it  
But we'll come through don't doubt it  
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me  
You won't kill me  
You won't kill me  
But I look into your eyes  
And I wonder sometimes  
  
Oh Lord, just let him see me  
Lord, Lord just let him hear me  
Let him call me brother  
Let him put his arms around me  
Let him put his hands together.  
  
Reach over race and hold each other's hands  
Walk through the night thinking we are the world  
Woa! What's going on?  
There'll be some blood no doubt about it  
But we'll come through don't doubt it  
  
I look into your eyes and I know you won't kill me  
You won't kill me  
You won't kill me  
But I wonder why  
Yes, and I wonder why sometimes  
  
They'll show us how to break the rules  
But never how to make the rules  
Reduce us down to witless punks  
Facist cries both black and white, who's got the blood, who's got the gun.  
  
Putting on the black tie, cranking out the white noise

Oh you, you walk on past  
Your lips cut a smile on your face  
Your scalding face  
To the cage, to the cage  
She was a beauty in a cage  
  
Too, too high a price  
To drink rotting wine from your hands  
Your fearful hands  
Get me to a doctor's I've been told  
Someone's back in town the chips are down  
I just cut and blackout  
I'm under Japanese influence  
And my honor's at stake  
  
The weather's grim, ice on the cages  
Me, I'm Robin Hood and I puff on my cigarette  
Panthers are steaming, stalking, screaming  
  
If you don't stay tonight  
I will take that plane tonight  
I've nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
I'll kiss you in the rain  
Kiss you in the rain  
Kiss you in the rain  
In the rain  
Get me to the doctor  
  
Get me off the streets (get some protection)  
Get me on my feet (get some direction)  
Hot air gets me into a blackout  
Oh, get me off the streets  
Get some protection  
Oh get me on my feet (wo-ooh!)  
  
While the streets block off  
Getting some skin exposure to the blackout (get some protection)  
Get me on my feet (get some direction, wo-ooh!)  
Oh get me on my feet  
Get me off the streets (get some protection)

Tell me when you're sad  
I'm gonna make it cool again  
I know you're feeling bad  
Tell me when you're cool again  
  
Who'd have ever thought of it  
Who'd have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
  
We fly through the night  
The tears on your lips  
Life has your mind and soul  
It spins on your hips  
  
Who'd have ever thought of it  
Who'd have ever dreamed  
  
Who'd have ever thought of it  
Who'd have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me  
  
You look at me and you reach for the free blue sky  
I look to the stars as they flicker and float in your eyes  
And under these wings of steel the small town dies  
  
Who'd have ever thought of it  
Who'd have ever dreamed  
  
Who'd have ever thought of it  
Who'd have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
  
Who'd have ever thought of it  
Who'd have ever dreamed  
That a small town girl like you  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me  
Would be the boss of me

Heaven loves ya  
The clouds part for ya  
Nothing stands in your way  
When you're a boy  
  
Clothes always fit ya  
Life is a pop of the cherry  
When you're a boy  
  
When you're a boy  
You can wear a uniform  
When you're a boy  
Other boys check you out  
You get a girl  
These are your favourite things  
When you're a boy  
  
Boys  
Boys  
Boys keep swinging  
Boys always work it out  
  
Uncage the colours  
Unfurl the flag  
Luck just kissed you hello  
When you're a boy  
  
They'll never clone ya  
You're always first on the line  
When you're a boy  
  
When you're a boy  
You can buy a home of your own  
When you're a boy  
Learn to drive and everything  
You'll get your share  
When you're a boy  
  
Boys  
Boys  
Boys keep swinging  
Boys always work it out

Living in lies by the railway line  
Pushing the hair from my eyes  
Elvis is English and climbs the hills  
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies  
Screaming along in South London  
Vicious but ready to learn  
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer  
Sometimes but always in vain  
  
[Chorus]  
So I'll wait until we're sane  
Wait until we're blessed and all the same  
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give  
Englishman going insane  
Down on my knees in suburbia  
Down on myself in every way  
  
With great expectations I change all my clothes  
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold  
Screaming above Central London  
Never bored, so I'll never get old  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Day after  
Day after  
Day  
Day after  
Zane, Zane, Zane  
Ouvre le chien  
Day after  
Day  
Day after  
Zane, Zane, Zane  
Ouvre le chien  
Day after

There's a cry that is heard in the city  
From Vivian at Pentecost Lane  
A shriekin' and dancing till four a.m.  
Another night of muscles and pain  
I love you despite your convictions  
That God never laughs at my jokes  
I'm a young man at odds with the Bible  
But I don't pretend faith never works  
When we're down on our knees  
Prayin' at the bus stop  
Now Jesus he came in a vision  
And offered you redemption from sin  
I'm not sayin' that I don't believe you  
But are you sure that it really was him  
I've been told that it could've been blue cheese  
Or the meal that we ate down the road  
I'm a young man at odds with the Bible  
But I don't pretend faith never works  
When we're down on our knees  
Prayin' at the bus stop  
Hallelujah  

Once there was a fellow  
And his name was Buzz.  
He was just a rookie cop  
Just a baby fuzz.  
He patrolled the Sunset Strip  
In the land of the free  
And the home of the hip.  
He protected you and me  
From evil women like  
Poor Alice D  
Alice was the girl  
That all good hippies dread  
And they called her sweet Alice D'head  
Alice it was plain to see was  
Full of pot and STP  
She'd attract a great big crowd  
Because her inner peace was much too loud.  
Good Buzz did the thing  
That all the good fuzz must  
Stuck his gun in Alice's back  
And said 'This is a bust'  
Shone the flashlight in her eyes  
She began to hypnotize  
Buzz said 'What a wild sensation'  
Guess this must be hallu hallucina cina cina cination hmmm  
Love is so sensational  
When you fall in love with eyes dilational la la  
Now they're taking pills and shots  
And Buzz is not afraid of Watts  
Buzz and Alice D have shown  
The way of where the Fuzz might be some day  
Buzz is still a cop of course  
He's the pusher on the force  
He's protecting you and me  
From evil women like  
Poor Alice D  

Once we were lovers, can they understand?  
Closer than others I was your, I was your man  
Don't talk of heartaches, oooh, I remember them all  
When I'm checking you out one day, to see if I'm  
Faking it all  
  
CHORUS  
Can you hear me?  
Can you feel me inside?  
Show your love, love  
Take it in right (take it in right)  
Take it in right (take it in right)  
  
There's been many others (Oo-oo-oo-oohh) so many times  
Sixty new cities an' what do I, what do I  
What do I find?  
I want love so badly, I want you most of all  
You know it's harder to take it from anyone  
It's harder to fall  
Can you hear me call?  
  
CHORUS  
  
Well, can you hear me? (yeah)  
Can you feel me inside? (I do)  
Show your love, show your sweet, sweet love  
Show me your love  
  
Take it in right (take it in right)  
Take it in right, yeah (take it in right)  
Take it in right to your love life, baby  
Take it in right, to your love life  
Take it in right, take it in right, right to your love life  
Take it in right, ah  
Take it in, take it in right  
Right down, right down  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Mmmm, why don't you take it?  
(Right to your heart)  
Can you hear me?  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Can you feel me?  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Can you? Take it in right  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Wuhh, right down, right down  
(Right to your heart)  
Can you take it? Feel me?  
(Why don't you take it?)  
Down, to right down  
(Why don't you take it?)  
To your heart  
(Why don't you take it?)  
To your heart  
(Right to your heart)  
Take it down, take it down  
(Why don't you take it? Why don't you take it?)  
Take it in right  
(Right to your heart)

Question-time that says I brought dishonour  
My head's bowed in shame  
It seems that I've blackened the family name  
Mother says that she can't stand the neighbours talking  
I've gotta pack my bags, leave this home, start walking, yeah  
I'm guilty  
I wish that I was sorry this time  
I wish that I could pay for my crime  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
Remember when we used to go to church on sundays  
I lay awake at night, terrified of school on mondays  
Oh, but it's too late now  
I wish I was a child again  
I wish I felt secure again  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
As I pass a recreation ground  
I remember my friends, always been found and I can't  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
Now I leave them all in the never never land  
The station seems so cold the ticket's in my hand  
My girl calls my name hi dave  
Drop in, see around, come back  
If you're this way again"  
Oh, I'm on my own  
I've got a long way to go  
I hope I make it on my own  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  
I can't help thinking about me  

See these eyes so green  
I can stare for a thousand years  
Colder than the moon  
Well, it's been so long  
And I've been running on fire  
With gasoline  
See these eyes so red  
Red like jungle burning bright  
Those who feel me near  
Pull the blinds and change their minds  
It's been so long  
Still this pulsing night  
A plague I call a heartbeat  
Just be still with me  
But you wouldn't believe what I've been through  
You've been so long, well, it's been so long  
And I've been putting out the fire with gasoline  
Putting out the fire with gasoline  
See these tears so blue  
An ageless heart that can never mend  
Tears can never dry  
A judgement made can never bend  
See these eyes so green  
I can stare for a thousand years  
Just be still with me  
You wouldn't believe what I've been through  
Well you've been so long, it's been so long  
And I've been putting out fire with gasoline  
Putting out fire with gasoline  
Putting out fire  
I've been putting out fire  
Well it's been so long, so long, so long  
Yes it's been so long, so long, so long  
I've been putting out fire  
Been so long, so long, so long  
Been so long, so long, so long  
Been so long, so long, so long  
...  

Oh yeah  
Mm  
Still don't know what I was waiting for  
And my time was running wild  
A million dead-end streets and  
Every time I thought I'd got it made  
It seemed the taste was not so sweet  
So I turned myself to face me  
But I've never caught a glimpse  
Of how the others must see the faker  
I'm much too fast to take that test  
  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Don't want to be a richer man  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Just gonna have to be a different man  
Time may change me  
But I can't trace time  
  
I watch the ripples change their size  
But never leave the stream  
Of warm impermanence  
So the days float through my eyes  
But stil the days seem the same  
And these children that you spit on  
As they try to change their worlds  
Are immune to your consultations  
They're quite aware of what they're going through  
  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Don't tell them to grow up and out of it  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Wheres your shame  
Youve left us up to our necks in it  
Time may change me  
But you can't trace time  
  
Strange fascination, fascinating me  
Ah changes are taking the pace I'm going through  
  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Oh, look out you rock n rollers  
Ch-ch-ch-ch-changes  
(turn and face the strain)  
Ch-ch-changes  
Pretty soon now you're gonna get a little older  
Time may change me  
But I can't trace time  
I said that time may change me  
But I can't trace time

Whilst flying through an azure cloud  
A crystal girl i'd spy  
She kissed the blue bird's honey tongue  
And stuttered as she sighed  
I wish to sing the chicken song  
Ching-a-ling song is fine  
I'd give my jewels and caviar  
To make this daydream mine  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling  
Doo dah doo doo dah dah, doo dah dah dah dah dah dah dah  
While stepping through a heaven's eye  
Two lover souls we spied  
They wished the cloud boys sang to me  
  
A cheerful happy cry  
We love to play our love-strong hearts  
No better do we know  
No gifts of money do we give  
For love is all we own  
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling  
Na na na na na na, na na na na na na na na  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling,  
Ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling, ching-a-ling

Smiling girls and rosy boys  
Come and buy my little toys  
Monkeys made of gingerbread  
And sugar horses painted red  
  
Rich men's children running past  
Their fathers dressed in hose  
Golden hair and mud of many acres on their shoes  
Gazing eyes and running wild  
Past the stocks and over stiles  
Kiss the window merry child  
But come and buy my toys  
  
You've watched your father plough the fields with a ram's horn  
Sowed it wide with peppercorn and furrowed with a bramble thorn  
Reaped it with a sharpened scyth, thrashed it with a quill  
The miller told your father that he'd work it with the greatest will  
Now your watching's over you must play with girls and boys  
Leave the parsley on the stalls  
Come and buy my toys  
  
You shall own a cambric shirt  
You shall work your father's land  
But now you shall play in the market square  
Till you'll be a man  
  
Smiling girls and rosy boys  
Come and buy my little toys  
Monkeys made of gingerbread  
And sugar horses painted red

Oh come all you children  
Don't grab that scabby hand  
It belongs to Mr. Sniff and Tell  
It belongs to the candyman  
Don't whore your little bodies  
To the worms of paradise  
Like Everest, it's fatal  
Its peaks are cold as ice  
They're riding on the subways  
They're riding on the streets  
They'll ride you down to the gutters  
They'll ride you off your feet  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Yeah, piss on the icon monsters  
Whose guitars bequeath you pain  
They'll face you down to their level  
With their addictions and their fast lanes  
Corrupt with shaky visions  
And crack and Coke and alcohol  
They're just a bunch of assholes  
With buttholes for their brains  
You can't keep on riding  
The pain you know so well  
They'll ride you down to the gutter  
And they'll ride you down to Hell  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
And you the master dealer  
May death be on your brow  
May razors slash your mainline  
I'm calling you out right now  
May all your vilest nightmares  
Consume your shrunken head  
May the ho-ho-hounds of paranoia  
Dance upon your stinking bed  
Don't look at me you fuckhead  
This nation's turning blue  
Its stink it fouls the highways  
Its filth, it sticks like glue  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
They'll bury you in velvet  
And place you underground  
The hatred of yourself  
And the sufferings that conspire  
To take your little body  
And throw it to the fools  
Only your mind can take you out of this  
Only your mind or death  
I'm riding on the subway  
The subway down to Hell  
I've finished with this journey  
Now, I seem to know it well  
Gonna hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  
Hit Crack City  

I've come on a few years from my Hollywood Highs  
The best of the last, the cleanest star they ever had  
  
I'm stiff on my legend,  
The films that I made  
Forget that I'm fifty  
'Cause you just got paid  
  
[CHORUS]  
Crack, baby, crack,  
Show me you're real  
Smack, baby, smack, is that all that you feel  
Suck, baby, suck,  
Give me your head  
Before you start professing  
That you're knocking me dead  
  
You caught yourself a trick down  
On Sunset and Vine  
But since he pinned you baby  
You're a porcupine  
  
You sold me illusions for a sack full of checks  
You've made a bad connection 'cause I just want your sex  
  
[CHORUS]

Something's going on in society  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
You chew your fingers and stare at the floor  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
One wrong word and you're out of sync  
Talking bout a hands on policy  
(Big boys)  
Death to the trees  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
They weren't bad, they weren't brave  
Nothing is embarrassing  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
There are too many people, too much belief  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
Where there's trouble there's poetry  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
Your family is a football team  
(Big boys)  
This dot marks your location  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
Loneliness in a free society  
(Dancing with the big boys)  
(Big boys)  
This can be embarrassing

Two by two, they go walking by  
Hand in hand, they watch me cry  
[two by two, hand in hand]  
Lonely nights, I dream you're there  
Morning sun and you're gone  
[lonely nights, morning sun]  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
Do anything you say, do anything  
One desire I ask of you  
Please be mine, please be mine  
[one desire, please be mine]  
Thousand years and I'll return  
You'll be mine, you'll be mine  
[thousand years, you'll be mine]  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say  
[maybe] I'll do anything you say

Do anything you say, do anything  
Two by two they're walking by  
Hand in hand, they watch me cry  
[two by two, hand in hand]

Now we can talk in confidence  
Did you guess that we've been done wrong?  
Lies jumped the queue to be first in line  
Such a shameless design  
  
He thinks he's well screened from the man at the top  
It's a shame that his children disagree  
They coolly decide to sell him down the line  
Daddy's brainwashing time  
  
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
He's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
  
She's quite enthralled with the childhood of yore  
When a unit was a figure, not a she  
When lovers chose each other, now the perks are due  
Another memo to screw  
  
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
She's a dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
  
Can you wipe your nose, my child  
Without them slotting in your file a photograph?  
Can you sleep alone at night  
Wake to find the scorching light of neighbor Jim?  
He's come to turn you in  
  
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
Another dodo, no no, didn't hear it from me  
Another dodo, didn't hear it from me

I'm on my own, nowhere to roam  
I tell you baby, don't want no home  
I wander round, feet off the ground  
I even go from town to town  
I said I think this rock is grand  
Say I'll be your man  
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down  
  
I met this chick, the other day  
And then to me, she said she'll stay  
I get this pad, just like a cave  
And then we'll have, our living made  
And then I'll lead her on the ground  
My head is spinning round  
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down  
  
I, I, I, I, I need a lover 'cause someone new  
And then to her I will be true  
I'll buy her furs and pretty things  
I'll even buy a wedding ring  
But until then I'll settle down  
Say I'll be your man  
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down  
Until then I'll settle down  
Say I'll be your man  
Don't bring me down, don't bring me down  
Don't bring me down

Oh, little baby

Hope little girl  
Come blow me away  
I don't care much  
I win anyway  
Just a dog  
  
I'm God damn rich  
An exploding man  
When I talk in the night  
There's oil on my hands  
What a dog  
  
Fall dog is cruel and smart  
Smart time breaks the heart  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
  
Devil in a market place  
Devil in your bleeding face  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
What a dog  
  
There's always a moron  
Someone to hate  
A corporate tie  
A wig and a date  
Just a dog  
  
These blackest of years  
That have no sound  
No shape, no depth  
No underground  
What a dog  
  
Fall dog is cruel and smart  
Smart time breaks the heart  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
  
A devil in a market place  
A devil in your bleeding face  
Fall dog bombs the moon  
What a dog

What's your name?

In the event  
that this fantastic voyage  
Should turn to erosion  
and we never get old  
Remember it's true, dignity is valuable  
But our lives are valuable too  
  
We're learning to live with somebody's depression  
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression  
We'll get by, I suppose  
It's a very modern world,  
but nobody's perfect  
  
It's a moving world,  
but that's no reason  
To shoot some of those missiles  
Think of us as fatherless scum  
It won't be forgotten  
'Cause we'll never say anything nice again, will we?  
  
And the wrong words make you listen  
In this criminal world  
Remember it's true, loyalty is valuable  
But our lives are valuable too  
  
We're learning to live with somebody's depression  
And I don't want to live with somebody's depression  
We'll get by I suppose  
But any sudden movement I've got to write it down  
They wipe out an entire race and I've got to write it down  
But I'm still getting educated but I've got to write it down  
And it won't be forgotten  
'Cause I'll never say anything nice again, how can I?

Got to use her  
  
Every time I feel fascination  
I just can't stand still, I've got to use her  
Every time I think of what you pulled me through, dear  
Fascination moves sweeping near me  
Still I take ya  
  
CHORUS  
(Fascination) fascination  
(sure 'nuff) fascination  
(takes a part of me) takes a part of me  
(Can a heart-beat) can a heart-beat  
(live in a fever) live in a fever?  
(raging inside of me?)  
(Fascination) fascination  
(oh, yeah) oh yeah  
(takes a part of me) takes a part of me  
(I can't help it) I can't help it  
(I've got to use her) got to use her  
(every time, ooh)  
Fascination comes around  
(Ooh-oo-ooh)  
  
(Fascination) Your soul is calling  
Like when I'm walking  
Seems that everywhere I turn  
I hope you're waiting for me  
I know that people think  
That I'm a little crazy  
Ohh, better sex is fun  
I think I like fascination  
Still, tick  
  
CHORUS (twice)  
Ad-lib

There's a brand new dance but I don't know its name  
That people from bad homes do again and again  
It's big and it's bland full of tension and fear  
They do it over there but we don't do it here  
  
Fashion!  
Turn to the left  
Fashion!  
Turn to the right  
Oooh, fashion!  
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town  
Beep-beep Beep-beep  
  
Listen to me - don't listen to me  
Talk to me - don't talk to me  
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no  
Beep-beep  
  
There's a brand new talk, but it's not very clear  
Oh bop  
That people from good homes are talking this year  
Oh bop, fashion It's loud and tasteless and I've heard it before  
Oh bop  
You shout it while you're dancing on the ole dance floor  
Oh bop, fashion  
  
Fashion!  
Turn to the left  
Fashion!  
Right  
Fashion!  
We are the goon squad and we're coming to town  
Beep-beep

Listen to me - don't listen to me  
Talk to me - don't talk to me  
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no  
Beep-beep  
Beep-beep  
  
Listen to me - don't listen to me  
Talk to me - don't talk to me  
Dance with me - don't dance with me, no  
Beep-beep  
Beep-beep  
  
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion  
Oh, bop, do do do do do do do do  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fashion  
La-la la la la la la-la

Fill your heart with love today  
Don't play the game of time  
Things that happened in the past  
Only happened in your mind  
Only in your mind-forget your mind  
And you'll be free-yea'  
The writing's on the wall  
Free-yea'. And you can know it all  
If you choose. Just remember  
Lovers never lose  
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure [sic]  
And of thoughts unkind  
Gentleness clears the soul  
Love cleans the mind  
And makes it free.  
  
Happiness is happening  
The dragons have been bled  
Gentleness is everywhere  
Fear's just in your head  
Only in your head  
Fear is in your head  
Only in your head  
So forget your head  
And you'll be free  
The writing's on the wall  
Free-yea'. And you can know it all  
If you choose. Just remember  
Lovers never lose  
'Cause they are free of thoughts unpure  
And of thoughts unkind  
Gentleness clears the soul  
Love cleans the mind  
And makes it free!!  
  
Free-yea'. Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah-yeah [repeat]

Pushing through the market square, so many mothers sighing  
News had just come over, we had five years left to cry in  
News guy wept and told us, earth was really dying  
Cried so much his face was wet, then I knew he was not lying  
I heard telephones, opera house, favorite melodies  
I saw boys, toys electric irons and T.V.'s  
My brain hurt like a warehouse, it had no room to spare  
I had to cram so many things to store everything in there  
And all the fat-skinny people, and all the tall-short people  
And all the nobody people, and all the somebody people  
I never thought I'd need so many people  
  
A girl my age went off her head, hit some tiny children  
If the black hadn't a-pulled her off, I think she would have killed them  
A soldier with a broken arm, fixed his stare to the wheels of a Cadillac  
A cop knelt and kissed the feet of a priest, and a queer  
Threw up at the sight of that  
I think I saw you in an ice-cream parlor, drinking milk shakes cold and long  
Smiling and waving and looking so fine, don't think  
You knew you were in this song  
And it was cold and it rained so I felt like an actor  
And I thought of Ma and I wanted to get back there  
Your face, your race, the way that you talk  
I kiss you, you're beautiful, I want you to walk  
  
We've got five years, stuck on my eyes  
We've got five years, what a surprise  
We've got five years, my brain hurts a lot  
We've got five years, that's all we've got

Monday morning feels so bad  
Everybody seems to nag me  
Coming Tuesday I feel better  
Even my old man looks good  
Wednesday just don't go  
Thursday goes too slow  
I've got Friday on my mind  
  
[CHORUS]  
(See my baby)  
Gonna have fun in the city  
(feel like fucking you)  
(Do my baby screw)  
Be with my girl  
She's so pretty  
(all I want to do)  
(I'll go crazy)  
She looks fine tonight  
(zoom zoom zoom)  
She is out of sight to me (so divine)  
(Tonight) I spend my bread  
(Tonight) I lose my head  
(Tonight) I've got to get tonight  
Monday I have Friday on my mind  
  
Do the five day drag once more (Monday blue)  
  
There is nothing else that bugs me  
More than working for the rich men (poor man, beggar  
Man, thief)  
Hey I'll change that scene one day  
Today I might be mad  
Tomorrow I'll be glad  
'Cause I'll have Friday on my mind  
  
[CHORUS]  
  
(See my baby) (feel like fucking you)  
Gonna have fun  
(zoom zoom zoom)  
Be with my girl [repeat ad lib.]

Oh hideous year we angels have lead  
We're dead, we're sick and hanging by thread  
Get real, get real  
You can't stop meaningful teenage cries  
From deep behind fifty year old eyes  
Get real, get real  
I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone  
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun  
Against the voice of doom failures fall all over town  
I guess I should, I feel I should, get real, get real  
What's up? What happened when I wasn't around?  
Who did what? What went down?  
Get real, get real  
Think about myself it happens to me  
It happens in the tunnel when I let myself feel  
Get real, get real  
I'm scared to touch, too tense to be undone  
I walk the streets not expecting morning sun  
I feel it all through breakdowns falling all over town  
I feel I should, I guess I should, get real, get real  
Get real, get real  
The dazzle of light, the rape of life  
The seed, the curse, the jazz of life  
Get real, get real, get real  

Girls, they come and they go  
They kiss, come and they go  
Like breeze brushing my cheek  
Like pain, like the tears on my face  
  
Girls, they come and they go  
Like spirits, they vanish at dawn  
My heart suspended in time  
Like you vanish like tears in the rain  
  
Girls, they take their loves away  
Like spirits living so far away  
  
Girls, pretending to break down and cry  
Girls, whispering wind  
What are they giving away  
  
We used to be so happy  
Remember, remember so happy  
I never knew how lonely  
How lonely, how lonely I could feel  
  
Girls, they come and they go  
They kiss, they come and they go  
Like spirits brushing my cheek  
Like pain, like the tears on my face  
  
Girls, they take their loves away  
Like spirits, living so far away  
  
Girls, pretending to break down and cry  
Girls, whispering wind  
What are they giving away  
  
We used to be so happy  
Remember, remember so happy  
I never knew how lonely  
How lonely, how lonely I could feel  
  
Girls

Up until one century ago there lived,  
In the Zi Duang provence of eastern country  
A glass-like spider.  
Having devoured its prey it would drape the skeletons over its web,  
In weeks creating a macabre  
  
Shrine of remains  
Its web was also unique in that it had many layers,  
Like floors in a building  
  
At the top of this palace-like place, assembled with almost apparent  
Care, were tiny, shining objects, glass, beads, dew-drops.  
One could almost call it an altar.  
When the breeze blew through this construction,  
It produced sounds of wailing, crying.  
Tiny wails, tiny cries.  
  
The baby spiders would get scared and search frantically  
For their mother.  
But the Glass Spider would have long gone, having known that the babies  
Would survive someone on their own.  
Oh-The Glass Spider had blue eyes almost like-a human's.  
They shed tears at the wintered turn of the centuries.  
  
Don't you hear this wasted cry, Life is over you  
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)  
But you've seen who's in heaven. Is there anyone in hell  
(Mummy come back 'cause it's dark now)  
Take care, take care.  
(Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone)  
Somewhere she glows divine. Somewhere she wakes alone.  
But you, you've promise in your lovin' eye. God it's dark now.  
  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
  
Gone, Gone the water's all gone  
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone  
Stay low on the ground, fire can drive you, savage and afraid  
Spitting the dawn, come come come along before the animals awake  
Run, run, we've been moving all night, rivers to the left.  
If your mother don't love you then the riverbed might  
Gone, gone, the water's all gone  
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone  
  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
Jah Jah Jah Jah Jah  
  
Gone gone the water's all gone  
Mummy come back 'cause the water's all gone

Was walking through the counters of a national concern  
And a cash machine was spitting by my shoulder  
  
And I saw the multitude of faces, honest, rich and clean  
As the merchandise exchanged and money roared  
And a woman hot with worry slyly slipped a tin of stewing steak  
Into the paper bag at her side  
And her face was white with fear in case her actions were observed  
So she closed her eyes to keep her conscience blind  
  
Crying  
"God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God may look the other way today  
  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God may look the other way today"  
  
Then she moved toward the exit clutching tightly at her paper bag  
Perspiration trickled down her forehead  
And her heart it leapt inside her as the hand laid on her shoulder  
She was led away bewildered and amazed  
Through her deafened ears the cash machines were shrieking on the counter  
As her escort asked her softly  
For her name  
And a crowd of honest people rushed to help a tired old lady  
Who had fainted to the whirling  
Wooden floor  
  
Crying  
"God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
Surely God won't look  
The other way  
  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
God knows I'm good  
Surely God won't look  
The other way"

(Hallo) Spaceboy, you're sleepy now [second time Hallo]  
Your silhouette is so stationary  
You're released but your custody calls  
And I want to be free  
  
Don't you want to be free  
Do you like girls or boys  
It's confusing these days  
But Moondust will cover you  
Cover you  
  
This chaos is killing me

So bye bye love

Yeah bye bye love

Bye bye love  
  
Moondust will cover you

Well she's a tongue twisting storm, she will come to the show tonight  
Praying to the light machine  
She wants my honey not my money she's a funky-thigh collector  
Layin' on 'lectric dreams  
  
[Chorus]  
So come on, come on, we've really got a good thing going  
Well come on, well come on, if you think we're gonna make it  
You better hang on to yourself  
  
We can't dance, we don't talk much, we just ball and play  
But then we move like tigers on vaseline  
Well the bitter comes out better on a stolen guitar  
You're the blessed, we're the spiders from Mars  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
Come on, ah, come on, ah (repeat ad inf.)

Baby, I dream between the blade and the tongue  
Of the rose on your cheek the wounded and dumb  
We stumble and fall we stumble and fall  
Skin on skin but there's heaven in  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
The first and the last are telling it all  
Telling you loud but selling it small  
I'm taking a swing at this shadow of mine  
Crucifix hangs and my heart's in my mouth but it's here  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
Heaven in one sigh, heaven in two eyes  
Heaven lies between your marbled thighs  
The rustle of your falling gown  
We stumble and fall like tragedy falls  
We stumble and twirl there's heaven in here  
We stumble and fall uncertain we fall  
Flesh on flesh but there's heaven in  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Heaven's in here  
Among the twilight and stars  
Like a rocket to Mars  
Heaven in here  
You'll dance to my tongue  
We'll dance on the sun  
We're the twilight and stars  
There's heaven in here  

I hurt myself today  
To see  
If I still feel  
I focus on the pain  
The only thing that's real  
The needle tears a hole  
The old familiar sting  
Try to kill it all away  
But I remember everything  
  
What have I become?  
My sweetest friend  
Everyone I know  
Goes away in the end  
You could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
  
I wear my crown of shit  
On my liar's chair  
Full of broken thoughts  
I cannot repair  
Beneath the stain of time  
The feeling disappears  
You are someone else  
I am still right here  
  
What have I become?  
My sweetest friend  
Everyone I know  
Goes away in the end  
You could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
If I could start again  
A million miles away  
I would keep myself  
I would find a way

I can't read and I can't write down  
I don't know a book from countdown  
I don't care which shadow gets me  
All I've got is someone's face  
Money goes to money heaven  
Bodies go to body hell  
I just cough and catch the chase  
Switch the channel, watch the police car  
I can't read shit anymore  
I just sit back and ignore  
'Cause I just can't get it right, can't get it right  
I can't read shit, I can't read shit  
When you see a famous smile  
No matter where you run your mile  
To be right in that photograph  
Andy where's my fifteen minutes, fifteen, yeah  
I can't read shit anymore  
I just can't read shit anymore  
No matter I just can't get it right  
I can't read shit, I can't read shit, no, no  

N obokov is sun-licked now  
Upon the beach at Gruenwald  
Brilliant and naked just  
The way that authors looks  
  
Clare and Lady Manners drink  
Until the other cows go home  
Gossip till their lips are bleeding  
Politics and all  
  
I'd rather be high, I'd rather be high  
I'd rather be flying, I'd rather be flying  
I'd rather be dead or out of my head  
Than training these guns on those men in the sand  
  
I'd rather be high  
The Thames was black, the tower dark  
I flew to Cairo, find my regiment  
City's full of generals  
And generals full of shit  
  
I stumble to the graveyard and I  
Lay down by my parents, whisper  
Just remember duckies  
Everybody gets got  
  
I'd rather be high, I'd rather be high  
I'd rather be flying, I'd rather be flying  
I'd rather be dead or out of my head  
Than training these guns of those men in the sand  
I'd rather be high  
  
I'm seventeen and my looks can prove it  
I'm so afraid that I will lose it  
I'd rather smoke and phone my ex  
Be pleading for some teenage sex, yeah  
  
I'd rather be high, I'd rather be high  
I'd rather be flying, I'd rather be flying  
I'd rather be dead or out of my head  
Than training these guns on the men in the sand  
  
I'd rather be high, I'd rather be high  
I'd rather be flying, I'd rather be flying  
I'd rather be flying, I'd rather be high  
I'd rather be flying

(Ferry)  
  
If there is something  
That I might find  
Look around corners  
Try to find peace of mind,  
I say  
"Where would you go  
If you were me?  
Trying to keep a straight course  
Is not easy"  
  
Somebody special  
Looking at me  
Same kind of reaction  
Wanted to cry with me  
If there are many  
Too easy to say  
When it's love  
It's just a game-ame-ame-ame  
  
I would do anything for you  
I would come all day  
I would swim all the oceans blue  
I would walk a thousand miles  
Reveal my secrets  
More than enough for me to share  
I will put roses around your door  
Sit in the garden  
Growing potatoes by the score  
  
Shake your head girl,  
With your ponytail  
Takes me right back  
[when you were young]  
Throw your precious gifts into the air  
Watch them fall down  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
It used to fall apart  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The hills were higher  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The trees were taller then  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
The grass was greener  
[when you were young]  
  
Your love - could feel you put them on the ground  
It used to fall apart  
[when you were young]

She lit a cigarette  
Both hands behind her back  
Thought she was hungry  
Lack of choice saw to that  
  
Only you can try to see  
What I'm really like  
She said, only you can understand  
The way I feel tonight  
  
She blamed excesses  
On the American dream  
So seldom witnessed  
Never seen  
  
Imagination could make a man of you  
Imagination could make me love you too  
Imagination is all I want from you  
  
She lost her virtue  
Before she could write  
I lost mine too  
On my very first night with you  
  
You'll have to guide me  
These impossible schemes  
You make me steal  
Unstealable things  
  
She blamed excesses  
On the American dream  
So seldom witnessed  
Never seen  
  
Imagination could make a man of you  
Imagination could make me love you too  
Imagination is all I want from you  
  
And she blamed excesses  
On the American dream  
So seldom witnessed  
Never seen  
  
Imagination could make a man of you  
Imagination could make me love you too  
Imagination is all I want from you  
  
Imagination, imagination  
Imagination, imagination  
  
Imagination, imagination  
Imagination, imagination  
Imagination, imagination  
Imagination, imagination

Hey Jack, I better shake it off, put her out of my head  
Thinking I balled just another young girl last night  
Oh brother, I left a woman in that morning bed  
Been on that trip so many times  
Good God, was it really yesterday?  
  
I've tried so many, many, many, many, many, many ways  
I've lied and taken off into the day  
Leaving another girl to weep over the breakfast tray  
Loved her before I knew her name, hit me Jack, 'cos I'm  
Gonna love her way  
  
Come back, my babe  
Come back, my babe  
Be holy again, I gave her  
I gave her, maybe, maybe  
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby  
  
That kind of love, can only destroy  
I gave her, maybe, maybe  
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby  
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me  
  
There was no rein to check me  
When all of those little things walked on by  
Oh, but I couldn't really stammer out a word  
When that angel stuck in my mind  
Looking for love won't hold me back  
No, I'm gonna love her way  
  
Come back, my babe  
Come back, my babe  
Be holy again, I gave her  
I gave her, maybe, maybe  
Maybe, gotta give her, ooh baby, baby, baby  
  
That kind of love, can only destroy  
I gave her, maybe, maybe  
Get it down if I'm gonna be her baby, 'cos, baby  
Gonna be me, it's gonna be me  
  
Just playing that latest record  
Waiting for the telephone to ring  
Wiped out and bitter with a bag clutched in her hand  
All the cars sound like they're pulling in the drive  
No, no, no  
  
I see her now a little tear running down her cheek  
Lost, let down, people looking for me  
I want to race down her street  
And knock hard  
  
Hard, hard on the door until  
Until she breaks down into my arms like a  
Treasured toy and I feel her pain  
I'll be so strong, again and again  
  
Come back my baby  
I'm hold you again, I'll take you  
I'll take you, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, we're gonna have, ooh baby, baby, baby  
  
My kind of love, can only bring you joy, I'm gonna  
Yeah, baby, baby, yeah, I'll give you baby, baby, baby  
'Cos it's gonna be me, it's gonna be me

I am bored from the event  
I really don't understand the situation  
But it's no game  
  
Documentaries on refugees  
Couples 'gainst the target  
You throw a rock against the road  
And it breaks into pieces  
Draw the blinds on yesterday, and it's all so much scarier  
Put a bullet in my brain, and it makes all the papers  
  
Nammin no kiroku eiga

There's always tomorrow when people have their fingers broken  
To be insulted by these fascists - it's so degrading  
And it's no game  
  
Shutup! shutu...

When people have their fingers broken2  
To be insulted by these fascists  
It's so degrading

Shut up! Shut up!

Oh my love, Janine  
I'm helpless for your smile  
Like a Polish wander  
I travel ever onwards to your land  
And were it not just for the jewels, I'd close your hand  
  
Your strange demand  
To collocate my mind  
Scares me into gloom  
You're too intense  
I'll have to keep you in your place  
I've no defense  
I've got to keep my veil on my face  
  
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well  
But I've got things inside my head  
That even I can't face  
  
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls  
But if you take an axe to me  
You'll kill another man  
Not me at all  
  
You're fey, Janine  
A tripper to the last  
But if I catch you standing on my toes  
I'll have a right to shout you down  
For you're a lazy stream  
In which my thoughts would drown  
  
So stay, Janine  
And we can glide along  
I've caught your wings for laughs  
I'm not obliged to read you statements of the year  
So take your glasses off  
And don't act so sincere  
  
Janine, Janine, you'd like to know me well  
But I've got things inside my head  
That even I can't face  
  
Janine, Janine, you'd like to crash my walls  
But if you take an axe to me  
You'll kill another man  
Not me at all  
Yeah  
Oh ah  
Ooooo  
Oh Janine  
Hey Janine  
Oh Janine  
Ah ho  
Oh Janine  
Ho how  
Janine  
Ah Janine yeah  
Janine Janine Janine  
Yeah yeah

Joe the lion  
Went to the bar  
A couple of drinks on the house an' he said  
"Tell you who you are if you nail me to my car"  
Boy  
Thanks for hesitating  
This is the kiss off  
  
Boy  
Thanks for hesitating  
You'll never know the real story  
Just a couple of dreams  
You get up and sleep  
  
You can buy god it's Monday  
Slither down the greasy pipe  
So far so good no one saw you  
Hobble over any freeway  
You will be like your dreams tonight  
  
You get up and sleep  
You get up and sleep  
Joe the lion  
Made of iron  
  
Joe the lion  
Went to the bar  
A couple of drinks on the house an' he was  
A fortune teller he said  
"Nail me to my car and I'll tell you who you are"  
  
Joe the lion, yeah yeah  
Went to the bar, yeah yeah  
A couple of dreams and he was  
A fortune teller he said  
"Nail me to my car tell you who you are"  
  
You get up and sleep  
The wind blows on your check  
The day laughs in your face  
Guess you'll buy a gun  
You'll buy it secondhand  
You'll get up and sleep  
  
Joe the lion made of iron (repeat ad inf.)

Well, Annie's pretty neat, she always eats her meat  
Joe is awful strong, bet your life he's putting us on  
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving  
Oh move me, touch me  
  
[Chorus]  
John, I'm only dancing  
She turns me on, but I'm only dancing  
She turns me on, don't get me wrong  
I'm only dancing  
  
Oh shadow love was quick and clean, life's a well-thumbed machine  
I saw you watching from the stairs, you're everyone that ever cared  
Oh lordy, oh lordy, you know I need some loving  
Move me, touch me  
  
[Chorusx2]  
  
Dancing  
Won't someone dance with me?  
Touch me, ohhh!

Let me introduce you to the gang  
Johnny plays the sitar, he's an existentialist  
Once he had a name, now he plays our game  
You won't feel so good now that you've joined the gang  
  
Molly is the model in the ads  
Crazy clothes and acid full of soul and crazy hip  
Someone switched her on, then her beam went wrong  
Cause she can't switch off now that she's joined the gang  
  
Arthur is a singer with a band  
Arthur drinks two bottles just before he goes on stage  
Look at Arthur rave, all the kids are paid  
They want to see the croaking man who joined the gang  
  
You won't be alone, we've all got beery grins  
It's a big illusion but at least you're in  
At least you're in  
  
This club's called The Webb, it's this month's pick  
Next month we shall find a place where prices aren't so stiff  
15 bob a coke, 'fraid that's past a joke  
This is how to spend now that you've joined the gang  
  
This is what to do now that you're here  
Sit round doing nothing all together very fast  
Psychedelic stars, throwing down cigars  
They're picking up the joints now that they've joined the gang

Julie  
Oh  
And I know  
  
Like a mirror, Sunday morning  
When the dark clouds hung above  
I saw you kneeling 'neath a garden  
I saw the grim and stood above  
  
What kind of meaning in a gun shot  
It doesn't matter what they say  
I never felt I aimed at no one  
And who's gonna take the gun away  
  
Julie  
Pretend for me  
That I'm someone in your life  
  
Julie  
I'm yours till the end  
All the days and memories  
  
I'm not a man of single reason  
It's in every single man  
This beat of jealous retribution  
And every spurned heart makes its plan  
  
Well, I know that you really loved him  
And I know that if there's a God above  
Through million times we'll remember  
How the trail slips away  
  
Julie  
Pretend for me  
Even only for a while  
  
Julie  
My soul is on the line  
All the days and memories  
  
Julie  
Remember me  
All the days of your life  
  
Julie  
I'm lost over you  
Passion always ends this way  
End this way

When comes the shaking man  
A nation in his eyes  
Striped with blood and emblazed tattoo  
Streaking cathedral spire  
  
They say  
He has no brain  
They say  
He has no mood  
They say  
He was born again  
They say  
Look at him climb  
They say 'jump'  
  
They say  
He has two gods  
They say  
He has no fear  
They say  
He has no eyes  
They say  
He has no mouth  
  
They say hey that's really something  
They feel he should get some time  
I say he should watch his ass  
My friend don't listen to the crowd  
They say 'jump'  
  
Got to believe somebody  
Got to believe

Fingertip sun at sideshow stalls, they throw the balls  
At coconut fur that hides behind coloured shades that blind your eyes  
Every child's mother holds an ice-cream cone, they circle round  
Perceived unknown by an eye that peers from a hole in the tent where no one
goes  
A figure sitting cross-legged on the floor he's clogged and clothed in saffron
robes  
His beads are all he owns  
Slow down, slow down  
Someone must have said that slow him down  
Slow down, slow down  
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man  
Fairy tale skin, depicting scenes from human zoos  
Impermanent toys like peace and war a gentle face you've seen before  
Karma man tattooed on your side, the wheel of life  
I see my times and who I've been I only live now and I don't know why  
I struggle hard to take these pictures in, but  
All my friends can see is just the pinkness of his skin  
Slow down, slow down  
Someone must have said that slowed him down  
Slow down, slow down  
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man  
Slow down, slow down  
Someone must have said that slowed him down  
Slow down, slow down  
It's pictured on the arms of the karma man  

Well I walked in the pouring rain  
And I heard a voice that cries "It's all in vain"  
The voice of doom was shining in my room  
I just need one day somewhere far away  
Lord I just need one day  
  
Well I'll be breaking these rocks  
And cutting this hay  
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks  
What's my price to pay  
  
Well the river's so muddy, but it may come clear  
And I know too well what's keeping me here  
I'm just the slave of a burning ray  
Oh give me the night, I can't take another sight  
Please, please give me the night  
  
Well I'll be breaking these rocks  
And cutting this hay  
Yes I'll be breaking these rocks  
What's my price to pay  
  
Sun keeps beating down on me, wall's a mile high  
Up in the tower they're watching me hoping I'm gonna die  
  
I won't be breaking no rocks  
I said I wont be breaking no rocks  
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh  
(I won't be breaking no rocks) Oh-oh-oh  
(I won't be breaking no rocks)  
  
When the kingdom comes  
When the kingdom comes  
When the kingdom comes  
When the kingdom comes

"You know who I am," he said  
The speaker was an angel  
He coughed and shook his crumpled wings  
Closed his eyes and moved his lips  
"It's time we should be going"  
  
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)  
Look back in anger, driven by the night  
Till you come  
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)  
Look back in anger, see it in my eyes  
Till you come  
  
No one seemed to hear him  
So he leafed through a magazine  
And, yawning, rubbed the sleep away  
Very sane he seemed to me  
  
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)  
Look back in anger, driven by the night  
Till you come  
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so)  
Look back in anger, feel it in my voice  
Till you come  
  
(Waiting so long, ahhh...)  
(Waiting so long, I've been waiting so, waiting so) (repeat ad inf.)

Gather 'round all you people  
Watch me while you can  
Been trawling too long, I've been losing out strong  
For the strength of another man  
  
I've been hasty, wasty standing on the backstep  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
But this semi-acoustic love affair  
Is driving me to the brink  
  
I'm just looking for a friend  
I'm just looking for a friend  
You don't have to be a big wheel, you don't have to be the end  
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend  
  
God help all you ladies  
May the devil take all you men  
You're far too busy having babies  
To help yourselves to a friend  
  
You're lazy, crazy hung upon the insane  
Waiting for the phone to ring  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible] the wall  
  
I'm just looking for a friend  
I'm just looking for a friend  
You don't have to be a big wheel, you don't have to be the end  
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend, looking  
  
I'm just looking for a friend  
I'm just looking for a friend  
You don't have to be a big wheel, you don't have to be the end  
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend  
  
I'm just looking for a friend  
I'm just looking for a friend  
You don't have to be a big wheel, you don't have to be the end  
I'm just looking for, looking for a friend

Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boyzone  
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop  
Where do we go from here?  
There's something in the sky  
Shining in the light  
Spinning and far away  
Nowhere, Shampoo, TV, Combat, Boy's own  
Slim tie, Showdown, Can't stop, (Satellite)

There's nothing in our eyes  
As lonely as a moon  
Misty and far away

Silver leaves are spinning round  
Take my hand as we go down and down and down  
Looking for water  
But I lost God in a New York minute  
Don't know about you but my heart's not in it  
(Looking looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
(Looking looking looking)  
I can't breathe the air  
Can't raise the fight  
'Cause all we've got left is a beat in the night  
And I'm  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking for water  
Looking looking  
  
Take my hand as we go down and down  
Leave it all behind nothing will be found  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking everywhere  
Looking for water  
Looking here and there  
I'm looking for water  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
  
I can't live in this cage  
I can't eat this candy  
To the ends of the Earth  
To this pain in my head  
The look in your eyes  
That never means never  
The dawns early light  
Baby dumb is forever  
  
(Looking looking)  
(Looking looking)  
  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water  
(Looking looking)  
I'm looking for water  
Looking for water

I'm looking for water  
Looking for water

I'm looking for water

Lucy I know what you're going to going to do  
Oh Lucy look what you're doing I'm doing it too  
Now you're looking for God in exciting new ways  
I say trust Him at once which is something these days  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Did the world just explode?  
Don't recognize anyone  
But you've still got me under your thumb  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Pursuing your frenzy in Ritz or Savoy  
In this sexual noise, vicious chords offer joy  
You live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Well I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do  
Lucy I know what you're going to going to do  
But you can't buy me off in this serial world  
Who who who died and made you material girl?  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
So I'll spin while my lunatic lyric goes wrong  
Guess I'll put all my eggs in a postmodern song  
Lucy can't dance to the noise but she knows what the noise can do  
Or this shallow orb mugged by reality  
Just a few simple words like I love you, I need you  
Live and you die in the blink of an eye  
Still I can't make you dance  
Dance to the noise  
Lucy can't dance but she knows what the noise can do

You remind me of the babe.  
(What babe?)  
The babe with the power.  
(What power?)  
The Power of voodoo.  
(Who do?)  
You do.  
(Do what?)  
Remind me of the babe.  
  
I saw my baby, crying hard as babe could cry  
What could I do?  
My baby's love had gone  
And left my baby blue  
Nobody knew  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dog tails?  
Thunder or lightning  
Then baby said  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Put that baby's spell on me  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
Put that magic jump on me  
Slap that baby, make him free!  
  
I saw my baby, trying hard as babe could try  
What could I do?  
My baby's fun had gone  
And left my baby blue  
Nobody knew  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dogs tails  
Thunder or lightning  
Then baby said:  
  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) (x4)  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump) (x2)  
  
Put that baby's spell on me (ooh)  
  
You remind me of the babe  
(What babe?)  
The babe with the power.  
(What power?)  
The power of voodoo.  
(Who do?)  
You do.  
(Do what?)  
Remind me of the babe  
  
Dance magic, dance, ooh ooh ooh  
Dance magic, dance magic, ooh ooh ooh  
Dance magic  
  
What kind of magic spell to use  
Slime and snails  
Or puppy dog tails  
Thunder or lightning  
Something frightening  
  
Dance magic, dance  
Dance magic, dance  
Put that baby's spell on me  
Jump magic, jump  
Jump magic, jump  
Put that magic jump on me  
Slap that baby make him free  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Jump magic, jump (jump magic, jump)  
Jump magic, jump  
Put that magic jump on me  
  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance)  
Dance magic, dance  
Slap that slap that baby make him free  
Dance magic, dance (dance magic, dance) (repeat ad-lib)

This girl is made of lipstick  
Powder and paint  
Sees the pictures of herself  
Every magazine on every shelf  
  
This girl is maid of Bond Street  
Hailing cabs, lunches with executives  
Gleaming teeth sip aperitifs  
  
This girl is a lonely girl  
Takes the train from Paddington to Oxford Circus  
Buys the Daily News  
But passengers don't smile at her, don't smile at her  
  
This girl is made of loneliness  
A broken heart  
For the boy that she once knew  
Doesn't want to know her any more  
  
And this girl is a lonely girl  
Every thing she wants is hers  
But she can't make it with the boy she really wants to be with  
All the time, to love, all the time  
  
This boy is made of envy  
Jealousy  
He doesn't have a limousine  
Really wants to be a star himself  
  
This girl, her world is made of flashlights and films  
Her cares are scraps on the cutting room floor  
  
And maids of Bond Street drive round in chauffered cars  
Maids of Bond Street picture clothes, eyes of stars  
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have worldly cares  
Maids of Bond Street shouldn't have love affairs

The children of the summer's end  
Gathered in the dampened grass,  
We played Our songs and felt the London sky  
Resting on our hands  
It was God's land.  
It was ragged and naive.  
It was Heaven.  
  
Touch, we touched the very soul  
Of holding each and every life.  
We claimed the very source of joy ran through.  
It didn't, but it seemed that way.  
I kissed a lot of people that day.  
  
Oh, to capture just one drop of all the ecstasy that swept that afternoon,  
To paint that love upon a white balloon,  
And fly it from the toppest top of all the tops that man has pushed beyond his  
Brain.  
Satoria must be something just the same.  
  
We scanned the skies with rainbow eyes and saw machines of every shape and
size.  
We talked with tall Venusians passing through.  
And Peter tried to climb aboard but the Captain shook his head  
And away they soared,  
Climbing through the ivory vibrant cloud.  
Someone passed some bliss among the crowd.  
And we walked back to the road, unchained.  
  
"The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party."  
"The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party."  
"The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party."  
"The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party."  
"The Sun Machine is coming down, and we're gonna have a party."

The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
The sun machine is coming down  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
The sun machine is coming down  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
The sun machine is coming down  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
The sun machine is coming down  
And we're gonna have a party  
  
The sun machine is coming down  
The sun machine is coming down  
The sun machine is coming down

Burning up each others' love, burning up our lives  
Tried all kinds of working out, miracle goodnight  
Future full and empty knocking on my door  
Ragged limbed and hungry mama  
Miracle no more  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Head tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing)  
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow dime on high  
Spin you round my little room, miracle goodnight  
Evening flower all alone, puzzling capeche  
Haven't got a death wish, just want a little more  
  
CHORUS  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Head tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing) miracle goodnight  
(Breath tell me) turn it around  
(Heart tell me) make it alright  
  
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe  
I wish I was a sailor a thousand miles from here  
I wished I had a future, anywhere  
I love you in the morning sun, I love you in my dreams  
I love the sound of making love, the feeling of your skin  
The corner of your eyes, I long forevermore  
I never want to say goodnight, miracle goodnight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't want to know the past, I want to know the real deal  
I really don't want to know that  
The less we know, the better we feel  
Morning star you're beautiful, yellow diamond high  
Spinning around my little room, miracle  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Skin tell me) turn it around  
(Moon tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing) it was only make believe  
(Eyes tell me) turn it around  
(News tell me) make it alright  
(Nobody dancing)  
  
[Chorus]
