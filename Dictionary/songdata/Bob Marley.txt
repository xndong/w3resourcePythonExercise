Ain't no sunshine when she's gone.  
It's not warm when she's away.  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long anytime she goes away.  
  
Wonder this time where she's gone,  
Wonder if she's gone to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away.  
  
And I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know,  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know  
  
Hey, I ought to leave the young thing alone,  
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone. Ain't no sunshine when she's  
Gone, only darkness everyday. Ain't no sunshine when she's gone,  
And this house just ain't no home anytime she goes away.  
  
Anytime she goes away.  
Anytime she goes away.  
Anytime she goes away.  
Anytime she goes away.

Well, don't hesitate, cause your love wont wait...  
  
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday  
Gonna tell you I love your way, everyday  
Wanna be with you night and day

With the help of some firefly  
Wonder how they have the power to shine  
I can see them under the pine  
But don't hesitate, cause your love wont wait...  
  
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday  
Gonna tell you I love your way, everyday  
Wanna be with you night and day  
  
(Solo - on verse) but don't hesitate, cause your love wont wait...  
I can see the sunset in your eyes  
Brown and grey, blue besides  
Clouds are stalking islands in the sun  
Wish I could buy one out of season  
But don't hesitate, cause your love wont wait...  
  
Ooo, baby, I love your way, everyday  
Gonna tell you I love your way, everyday  
Wanna be with you night and day

Old Mr. Joe knew he had to go, so he  
He got right down and wrote bank will

And her chicken, Lord have mercy now  
Master, will you take a roll in the mud  
Like you know you should?  
The old barnyard, the old barnyard  
Birds and the chick, ooh-wee

While the dish got jealous, he grabbed the handy spoon

Yesterday, a child came out to wander  
Caught a dragonfly inside a jar  
Fearful when the sky was full of thunder  
And tearful at the falling of a star  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
Then, the child moved ten times 'round the seasons  
Skated over ten clear frozen streams  
Words like, "When you're older", must appease him  
And promises of someday make his dreams  
  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came,  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
Sixteen springs and sixteen summers gone now  
Cartwheels turn to car wheels through the town  
And they tell him, "Take your time. It won't be long now.  
'Til your drag your feet to slow the circles down"  
  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and round and round  
In the circle game  
So the years spin by and now the boy is twenty  
Though his dreams have lost some grandeur coming true  
There'll be new dreams, maybe better dreams and plenty  
Before the last revolving year is through.  
And the seasons they go 'round and 'round  
And the painted ponies go up and down  
We're captive on the carousel of time  
We can't return, we can only look behind  
From where we came  
And go round and 'round and 'round  
In the circle game  
And go 'round and 'round and 'round in the circle game.

Turn your lights down low  
And pull your window curtain  
Oh let the moon come shining in  
Into our life again  
Saying ooh, it's been a long, long time  
(Long, long time)  
I got this message for you girl  
But it seems I was never on time  
Did I wanna get through to you girl?  
On time, on time (word)  
I want to give you some love  
I want to give you some good, good loving  
(Uh, uh, right, uh)  
Oh I, oh I, oh I

Every three minutes and thirty seconds of every day (uh, uh)  
And every chorus was written for us to recite (right)  
Every beautiful melody of devotion every night  
It's potion like this ocean that might carry me  
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me  
And every word, every second, and every third  
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (uh)  
And when I play them, every chord is a poem  
Telling the lord how grateful I am cause I know him (what? word)  
The harmonies possess a sensation similar to your caress (uh)  
If you asking then I'm telling you it's yes  
Stand in love, take my hand in love, god bless (right)  
  
I want to give you some good, good loving  
I want to give you some love  
I want to give you some good, good loving  
Oh I, oh I, oh I  
I wanna give you some good, good loving  
  
Good, good, good loving  
(I wanna give you some good loving)

Until the philosophy which hold one race superior  
And another  
Inferior  
Is finally  
And permanently  
Discredited  
And abandoned  
Everywhere is war  
Me say war.  
  
That until there no longer  
First class and second class citizens of any nation  
Until the colour of a man's skin  
Is of no more significance than the colour of his eyes  
Me say war.  
  
That until the basic human rights  
Are equally guaranteed to all,  
Without regard to race  
This is a war.  
  
That until that day  
The dream of lasting peace,  
World citizenship  
Rule of international morality  
Will remain in but a fleeting illusion to be pursued,  
But never attained  
Now everywhere is war - war.  
  
And until the ignoble and unhappy regimes  
That hold our brothers in Angola,  
In Mozambique,  
South Africa  
Sub-human bondage  
Have been toppled,  
Utterly destroyed  
Well, everywhere is war  
Me say war.  
  
War in the east,  
War in the west,  
War up north,  
War down south  
War - war  
Rumours of war.  
And until that day,  
The African continent  
Will not know peace,  
We Africans will fight - we find it necessary  
And we know we shall win  
As we are confident  
In the victory  
  
Of good over evil  
Good over evil, yeah!  
Good over evil  
Good over evil, yeah!  
Good over evil  
Good over evil, yeah!

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all  
Your Christmases be white

With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases

I'm dreaming of a white  
Christmas with you  
Jingle Bells  
All the way, all the way
