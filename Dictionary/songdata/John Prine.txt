I wish you love  
And happiness  
I guess I wish you  
All the best  
I wish you don't  
Do like I do  
And ever fall in love with  
Someone like you  
Cause if you fell  
Just like I did  
You'd probably walk around the block  
Like a little kid.  
But kids don't know  
They can only guess  
How hard it is  
To wish you happiness  
  
I guess that love  
Is like a Christmas card  
You decorate a tree  
You throw it in the yard  
It decays and dies  
And the snowmen melt  
Well I once knew love  
I knew how love felt  
Yeah I knew love  
Love knew me  
And when I walked  
Love walked with me  
And I got no hate  
And I got no pride  
Well I got so much love  
That I cannot hide  
  
Say you drive a Chevy  
Say you drive a Ford  
You say you drive around the town  
Till you just get bored  
Then you change your mind  
For something else to do  
And your heart gets bored with your mind  
And it changes you  
Well it's a doggone shame  
And it's an awful mess  
I wish you love  
I wish you happiness  
I wish you love  
I wish you happiness  
I guess I wish you  
All the best

Love gives  
Love takes  
It takes a lot of lucky breaks  
Lucky strikes  
Lucky stars  
I don't know how I got this far  
Who knows where it's coming from  
Or where it's going to  
Can I go all the way with you?  
  
You have your way  
You have your doubts  
The falling in  
The falling out  
A bridge is built  
A bridge is burned  
Till you reach the point of no return  
Don't know where we're coming from  
Or where we're going to  
  
Can I go all the way with you?  
Heaven knows that this ain't nothing new  
God knows how much I love you  
Love comes  
Love goes  
Can I go all the way with you?  
Can I go all the way with you?

I am an old woman named after my mother  
My old man is another child that's grown old  
If dreams were lightning thunder was desire  
This old house would have burnt down a long time ago  
  
[Chorus]  
Make me an angel that flies from Montgom'ry  
Make me a poster of an old rodeo  
Just give me one thing that I can hold on to  
To believe in this living is just a hard way to go  
  
When I was a young girl well, I had me a cowboy  
He weren't much to look at, just free rambling man  
But that was a long time and no matter how I try  
The years just flow by like a broken down dam.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's flies in the kitchen I can hear 'em there buzzing  
And I ain't done nothing since I woke up today.  
How the hell can a person go to work in the morning  
And come home in the evening and have nothing to say.  
  
[Chorus]

February morning, my car won't start today  
I turned the key at 8: 03 and the battery passed away  
Inside a' my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want to drive it all around this world  
  
Bride's gettin' married in the springtime  
Widow's gettin married in the fall  
I got married in high school  
Or I wouldn't of got married at all  
I'd be drivin' my automobile  
Be drivin' my automobile  
Be drivin' my automobile  
I wanna drive it all around this world  
  
Everybody said to the new groom  
Groom, what ya gonna be  
I said I'm gonna be a symphony  
Just as soon as I find a key  
To my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
All around this world  
  
Spoken:  
Let's take a ride  
  
Columbus sailed the ocean  
Moses parted the sea  
Dolores left me yesterday  
Well, I think she took the key  
To my automobile  
I want my automobile  
I want my automobile  
Wanna drive it all around this world  
  
Now I held a little bitty baby  
I held a woman all night  
Whenever I get the hiccups  
I hold my breath 'til my head gets light  
Then I drive my automobile  
Yeah I drive my automobile  
I drive my automobile  
I'm want to drive it all around this world  
  
February morning, my car won't start today  
Yeah, I turned the key at 8: 03  
And the battery passed away  
Inside a' my automobile  
I'm drivin' my automobile  
Wanna my automobile  
Wanna drive it all around this world  
Go on.  
  
Spoken:  
It is a beautiful day for a ride  
Hey, get your head down I can't see anything  
Someone give me a cigarette  
I don't want to take my hands off the wheel  
We ought to take the air filter off this sucker.  
So we can see what it will really do.  
Uh oh, it looks to me like a hos-pital zone  
Everybody get quiet. Shhhhhhhh.  
Don't wake the dead up.  
We're almost out. Hang on. Uh oh here we go.  
Well, you can just hold it until we get to the next town.

I could be as happy as a sardine in a can  
Long as I got my woman  
I could run stark naked and live in and old oak tree  
Just as long as she's with me  
My woman.  
The cannibals can catch me and fry me in a pan  
Long as I got my woman  
I could get the electric chair for a phony rap  
Long as she's sittin' in my lap  
My woman.  
I'd run a mile, just to see her smile  
And put her lovin arms, around my neck  
Aw heck  
My spine starts a tingling, and bells start a ringling  
When she's with me, can't you see.  
They could torture me and stretch me like a rubber band  
Long as I got my woman  
I could jump off a cliff and never have no fear  
Just as long as she is near  
My woman.  

You may go to college.  
You may go to school  
You might drive a pink Cadillac  
But don't you be nobody's fool  
  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you  
  
Listen to me baby.  
What I'm talking about  
Come on back me Little girl  
So we can play some house.  
  
Come back baby Come back  
Come back baby gone.  
Come back baby I want to play house with you  
  
Well, there's just one thing baby  
That I want you to know  
Come on back we can play a little house  
And we act like we did before.  
  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you  
  
Listen to me baby.  
Try to understand  
I rather see you dead little girl  
Than see you with another man  
  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. Come back.  
Come back, baby. I want to play house with you

Well it's sure good to see you  
But my how you've changed  
Since the last time I saw you  
Girl you've been rearranged  
I always said your people  
Were just like my kin  
When I was down and out  
They would always take me in  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I love you my Baby Ruth  
Never lie to you  
I only tell the truth  
Oh I love you since you were a child  
Every time I see you girl  
You always raise a smile  
  
I was living out on the highway  
You didn't turn me out  
I lived in your closet  
And you fed me by mouth  
My boots were my pillow  
Wrapped under my head  
I kept all my stuff  
Stashed out under your bed

I been a bad boy  
I been long gone  
I been out there  
I never phone home  
I never gave you not one little clue where I'd been  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I got a way of  
Fallin' in love  
With angels that don't shove  
You into thinkin' that you are committing a sin  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
I must have walked 'round  
In a real fog  
I was your best friend  
Now I'm a real dog  
I never thought that now  
Would ever catch up with then  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I've been a bad boy  
I sung a wrong song  
I took a left turn  
I stayed too long  
As you were thinkin' that I wasn't  
Just like all other men  
I've been a bad boy again.  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again  
I've been a bad boy again  
Now I've been a bad boy again  
And all the trouble that I'm in  
Makes me a bad boy again  

I threw a party. Nobody came.  
I bought all the tickets. They cancelled the game.  
I give you my picture. It didn't fit your frame  
Be my friend tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey, be my friend tonight  
  
Now you bring the glasses and Ill bring the wine  
Ill rub your shoulders just like they were mine  
I won't make no passes till its passing time  
If you're only gonna be my buddy tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey, be my friend tonight  
  
Well, Ill mind my manners. My p's and q's  
I won't give you nothing that you can't use  
Ill whip out that old guitar and sing you the blues  
Be my friend tonight  
  
Be my friend tonight. Be my friend tonight.  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on honey, be my friend tonight  
Be my friend tonight. be my friend tonight.  
  
Ill sleep on the couch. You can leave on that light.  
Well, I won't do nothing wrong till you say its right  
Come on darling, be my friend tonight  
Oh, come on honey, be my friend tonight  
Please, be my friend tonight.

Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down  
Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down  
Well, it makes me feel like I'm on my last go 'round  
Well, the water up on Bear Creek, tastes like cherry wine  
Yeah, the water up on Bear Creek, tastes like cherry wine  
One drink of that water, you stay drunk all the time  
If you stay up on Bear Creek, you'll get like Jesse James  
If you stay up on Bear Creek, you'll get like Jesse James  
You'll take two pistols and you'll rob that Bear Creek train  
I'm going high, high, up on some lonesome hill  
I'm going high, high, up on some lonesome hill  
Look down on Bear Creek where my good gal used to live  
Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down  
Way up on Bear Creek, watching the sun go down  
Well, it makes me feel like I'm on my last go 'round  

It started out when she was small  
She was premature  
She wasn't nothing at all  
Two pounds six ounces  
A little pumpkin seed  
But she got more love  
Than you ever gonna need  
  
[Chorus]  
She got big fat love  
She got big fat love  
  
She don't eat enough  
To keep her alive  
When she bends over  
She's a quarter to five  
Skinny little thing  
But she ain't afraid  
To dance the Watusi  
On a razor blade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tiny little hands  
Tiny little nose  
Tiny little footsteps  
Wherever she goes  
Little bit don't leave  
No bath rub ring  
You pull the plug  
She's down the drain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She got big fat love  
  
Bigger than me  
Bigger than you  
Bigger than the hippo  
Down at the zoo  
Thin is in  
Stout is out  
Big fat love  
Is what I'm talking about  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Billy, the bum lived by the thumb  
And sang of the hobo's delight  
He'd prove he could run  
Twice as fast as the sun  
By losing his shadow at night  
Now he loved every girl  
In this curly headed world  
But no one will know it seems  
For two twisted legs and a childhood disease  
Left Billy just a bum in his dreams  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart  
Humiliation killed him  
God bless his little heart  
Now he lived all alone in a run down home  
Near the side of the old railroad track  
Where the trains used to run  
Carryin' freight by the ton  
Blow the whistle as Billy'd wave back  
But the children around Billy's home town  
Seemed to have nothin' better to do  
Then run around his house  
With their tongues from their mouth  
Make fun of that crippled old fool  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart  
Humiliation killed him  
God bless his little heart  
Now some folks they wait and some folks they pray  
For Jesus to rise up again  
But none of these folks in their holy cloaks  
Ever took Billy on as a friend  
For pity's a crime  
And it ain't worth a dime  
To a person who's really in need  
Just treat 'em the same  
As you would your own name  
Next time that your heart starts to bleed  
And he was just a gentle boy  
A real fluorescent light  
Cried pennies on Sunday morning  
Laughs nickels on Saturday night  
And your bullets, they can't harm him  
Nor your knives tear him apart  
Humiliation killed him  
God bless his little heart  

Feelings are strange  
Especially when they come true  
And I had a feeling  
You'd be leaving soon  
  
So I tried to rearrange  
All my emotions  
But it seems the same  
No matter what I do.  
  
[Chorus]  
Blue umbrella  
Rest upon my shoulder  
Hide the pain  
While the rain  
Makes up my mind  
  
Well, my feet are wet  
From thinking this thing over  
And it's been so long  
Since I felt the warm sunshine  
  
Just give me one good reason  
And I promise I won't ask you any more  
Just give me one extra season  
So I can figure out the other four.  
  
Day time  
Makes me wonder why you left me  
Night time  
Makes me wonder what I said  
  
Next time  
Are the words I'd like to plan on  
But, last time  
Was the only thing you said.  
  
[Chorus]

My heart's in the ice house come hill or come valley  
Like a long ago sunday when I walked through the alley  
On a cold winter's morning to a church house  
Just to shovel some snow.  
  
I heard sirens on the train track howl naked gettin' nuder,  
An altar boy's been hit by a local commuter  
Just from walking with his back turned  
To the train that was coming so slow.  
  
You can gaze out the window get mad and get madder,  
Throw your hands in the air, say "what does it matter? "  
But it don't do no good to get angry,  
So help me I know  
  
For a heart stained in anger grows weak and grows bitter.  
You become your own prisoner as you watch yourself sit there  
Wrapped up in a trap of your very own  
Chain of sorrow.  
  
I been brought down to zero, pulled out and put back there.  
I sat on a park bench, kissed the girl with the black hair  
And my head shouted down to my heart  
"you better look out below!"  
Hey, it ain't such a long drop don't stammer don't stutter  
From the diamonds in the sidewalk to the dirt in the gutter  
And you carry those bruises to remind you wherever you go.

Well, the moon is yellow and the people are too  
They roll eggs on a bar-be-que  
I was feeling kinda cocky with a head full of sake  
Down in chinatown  
There was dragons flyin' kites high above the stores  
Dead fish heads laying on the floor  
I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie  
Down in chinatown  
And it was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa  
Yeah, suddenly yeah, suddenly whoa whoa  
They smelled fish  
We smelled like a meat  
Sucking on a soda pop oh so sweet  
Got a sugar rush that'd would make 'em blush  
Down in chinatown  
Won ton two ton three ton four  
Smoke a cigarette throw it on the floor  
I killed the pie-faced mothey with a shoeshine clothy  
Down in chinatown  
It was suddenly, was suddenly, whoa whoa  
Yeah, suddenly, yeah, suddenly whoa whoa  
The moonie is yellowie and the people are too  
They roll eggs on a bar-be-que  
I was feeling kinda cocky with head full of saki  
Down in chinatown  
I got a sideways hickey from a slant-eyed chickie  
Down in chinatown  
Hey, down in chinatown  
Hey, down in chinatown  

It was Christmas in prison and the food was real good  
We has turkey and pistols carved out of wood  
I dream of her always even when I don't dream  
Her name's on my tongue and her blood's in my stream  
  
Wait a while eternity  
Old Mother Nature's got nothin' on me  
Come to me, run to me, come to me now  
I'm rollin' my sweetheart  
I'm flowin' by God  
  
She reminds me of a chess game with someone I admire  
Or a picnic in the rain after a prairie fire  
Her heart is as big as this whole goddamn jail  
And she's sweeter than saccharine at a drug store sale  
  
Wait a while eternity  
Old Mother Nature's got nothin' on me  
Come to me, run to me, come to me now  
I'm rollin' my sweetheart  
I'm flowin' by God  
  
The search light in the big yard turns 'round with the gun  
And spotlights the snowflakes like the dust in the sun  
It's Christmas in prison there'll be music tonight  
I'll probably get homesick, I love you, Good night  
  
Wait a while eternity  
Old Mother Nature's got nothin' on me  
Come to me, run to me, come to me now  
I'm rollin' my sweetheart  
I'm flowin' by God

I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna get a ticket to ride  
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side  
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times  
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat  
Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet  
And get along with it all  
Go down where the people say "why'all"  
Sing a song with a friend  
Change the shape that I'm in,  
And get back in the game,  
And start playin' again  
I'd like to stay but I might have to go to start over again  
Might go back down to Texas, might go to somewhere that I've never been  
And get up in the mornin' and go out at night  
And I won't have to go home  
Get used to bein' alone  
Change the words to this song  
Start singin' again  
I'm tired of runnin' 'round lookin' for answers to questions that I already
know  
I could build me a castle of memories just to have somewhere to go  
Count the days and the nights that it takes to get back in the saddle again  
Feed the pigeons some clay  
Turn the night into day  
Start talkin' again, when I know what to say  
I'm goin' down to the Greyhound Station, gonna get a ticket to ride  
Gonna find that lady with two or three kids and sit down by her side  
Ride 'til the sun comes up and down around me 'bout two or three times  
Smokin' cigarettes in the last seat  
Tryin' to hide my sorrow from the people I meet  
And get along with it all  
Go down where the people say "why'all"  
Feed the pigeons some clay  
Turn the night into day  
Start talkin' again  
When I know what to say

Clocks and spoons and empty rooms  
It's raining out tonight  
What a way to end a day  
By turnin' out the light  
Shoot the moon right between the eyes  
I'm sending most of me to sunny country side  
  
Runnin' through sky of blue rollin in the sun  
Every day has a way of overflowing wine  
Shoot the moon right between the eyes  
I'm keeping most of me in sunny country side  
  
Don't know how I did that now wonder where it's gone  
Must have spent the way I went waitin' for the dawn  
Shoot the moon right between the eyes  
I'm screaming  
Take me back to sunny country side

The last time that I saw her  
She was standing in the rain  
With her overcoat under her arm  
Leaning on a horse head cane  
She said, "Carl, take all the money"  
She called everybody  
"Carl my spirit's broke  
My mind's a joke and getting up's real hard"  
Don't you know her when you see her?  
She grew up in your back yard  
Come back to us Barbara Lewis  
Hare Krishna Beauregard  
Selling bibles at the airports  
Buying Quaalude's on the phone  
Hey, you talk about, a paper route  
She's a shut in without a home  
God save her, please she's nailed her knees  
To some drugstore parking lot  
Hey, Mr. Brown turn the volume down  
I believe this evening's shot  
Don't you know her when you see her?  
She grew up in your back yard  
Come back to us Barbara Lewis  
Hare Krishna Beauregard  
Can't you picture her next Thursday?  
Can you picture her at all?  
In the Hotel Boulderado  
At the dark end of the hall  
I gotta shake myself and wonder  
Why she even bothers me  
For if heartaches were commercials  
We'd all be on TV  
Don't you know her when you see her?  
She grew up in your back yard  
Come back to us Barbara Lewis  
Hare Krishna Beauregard  

You can't live together, you can't live alone  
Considering the weather, oh my how you've grown  
From the men in the factories to the wild kangaroo  
Like those birds of a feather, they're gathering together  
And feeling exactly like you  
They got mesmerized by lullabies and limbo danced in Pairs  
Please lock that door, it don't make much sense  
That common sense, don't make no sense no more  
Just between you and me, it's like pulling  
When you ought to be shoving  
Like a nun with her head in the oven  
Please don't tell me that this really wasn't nothing  
One of these days, one of these nights  
You'll take off your hat and they'll read you, your rights  
You'll wanna get high every time you feel low  
Hey, Queen Isabella stay away from that fella  
He'll just get you into trouble, you know?  
But they came here by boat and they came here by plane  
They blistered their hands and they burned out their brain  
All dreaming a dream, that'll never come true  
Hey, don't give me no trouble, or I'll call up my double  
We'll play piggy-in-the-middle with you  
You'll get mesmerized by alibis and limbo dance in Pairs  
Please lock that door, it don't make much sense  
That common sense, don't make no sense no more  
It don't make much sense, that common sense  
Don't make no sense no more  

Back before I was a movie star  
Straight off of the farm  
I had a picture of another man's wife  
Tattooed on my arm  
  
With a pack of Camel cigarettes  
In the sleeve of my Tee shirt  
I'm headin' out to Hollywood  
Just to have my feelings hurt  
  
That town will make you crazy  
Just give it a little time  
You'll be walking 'round in circles  
Down at Hollywood and Vine  
  
You'll be waitin' on a phone call  
At the wrong end of a broom  
Yes, that town'll make you crazy  
Crazy as a loon  
  
So, I headed down to Nashville  
To become a country star  
Every night you'd find me hangin'  
At every honky-tonk and bar  
  
Pretty soon I met a woman  
Pretty soon she done me wrong  
Pretty soon my life got sadder  
Than any country song  
  
That town will make you crazy  
Just give it a little time  
You'll be walking 'round in circles  
Lookin' for that country rhyme  
  
You'll be waitin' on a phone call  
At the wrong end of a broom  
Yea, that town'll make you crazy  
Crazy as a loon  
  
So, I gathered up my savvy  
Bought myself a business suit  
I headed up to New York City  
Where a man can make some loot  
  
I got hired Monday morning  
Downsized that afternoon  
Overcome with grief that evening  
Now I'm crazy as a loon  
  
So I'm up here in the North Woods  
Just staring at a lake  
Wondering just exactly how much  
They think a man can take  
  
I eat fish to pass the time away  
'Neath this blue Canadian moon  
This old world has made me crazy  
Crazy as a loon  
Lord, this world will make you crazy  
Crazy as a loon

Things got rough  
Things got tough  
Things got harder than hard  
We were just trying to make a livin'  
In our back yard  
We were born too late died to soon  
Anxiety's a terrible crime  
If you don't come now don't come at all  
'cause it's a crooked piece of time.  
It's a crooked piece of time that we live in  
A crooked piece of time  
All in all and all in all  
It's a crooked piece of time.  
Yesterday morning an ill wind came  
Blew your picture  
Right out of the picture frame  
Even blew the candle out  
From underneath the flame  
Yesterday morning an ill wind came.  

You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
Why it's quarter past eleven  
And you're sleeping on the bedroom floor  
  
I can see the fire burning  
Burning right behind your eyes  
I can see the fire burning  
Burning right behind your eyes  
You must of swallowed a candle  
Or some other kind of surprise  
  
I'm going down to Memphis  
I got three hundred dollars in cash  
I'm going down to Memphis  
I got three hundred dollars in cash  
All the women in Memphis  
Want to see how long my money will last  
  
I'm going downtown  
I'm gonna to rattle somebody's cage  
  
I'm going downtown  
I'm gonna rattle somebody's cage  
I'm gonna beat on my guitar  
And strut all around the stage  
  
If you see my baby coming  
Don't tell her that her daddy's in jail  
If you see my baby coming  
Don't you tell her that her daddy's in jail  
She'd sell her little pumpkin just to raise  
Her sweet daddy's bail  
  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You must be daddy's little pumpkin  
I can tell by the way you roll  
You never do nothing  
To save your doggone soul.

Do you like me?  
Well I hope you do  
Cause if you like me  
Then I think I'm gonna to have to like you too  
  
We'll share our things  
And have some fun  
Then we'll say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
If you tell me  
I'll tell you too  
And we'll say the things  
And do the things that lovers do  
  
We'll keep it to ourselves  
We won't hurt no one  
Then we'll say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
We'll carve our names  
On a tree  
Then we'll burn it down  
So no one in the world will see  
  
And we'll make love  
While we watch the flame  
Then we'll walk away  
As if we never had no shame  
  
Now we must hide  
To be alone  
And we can't say  
Our sweet things on the telephone  
  
If we can't stop  
What we've begun  
We should say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
Do you still like me?  
Well I hope you do  
Cause if you still like me  
Then I think I'm gonna have to still like you  
  
We shared our things  
And had some fun  
Now we'll say goodbye  
And go back home when the day is done  
  
Yeah, we'll say goodbye  
And go back home while  
We still have one  
Let's say goodbye and go back home  
Now the day is done

Thank you

Small town, bright lights, saturday night,  
Pinballs and pool halls flashing their lights.  
Making change behind the counter in a penny arcade  
Sat the fat girl daughter of virginia and ray  
  
(spoken:)  
Lydia  
Lydia hid her thoughts like a cat  
Behind her small eyes sunk deep in her fat.  
She read romance magazines up in her room  
And felt just like sunday on saturday afternoon.  
  
Chorus:  
But dreaming just comes natural  
Like the first breath from a baby,  
Like sunshine feeding daisies,  
Like the love hidden deep in your heart.  
  
Bunk beds, shaved heads, saturday night,  
A warehouse of strangers with sixty watt lights.  
Staring through the ceiling, just wanting to be  
Lay one of too many, a young pfc:  
  
(spoken:)  
Donald  
There were spaces between donald and whatever he said.  
Strangers had forced him to live in his head.  
He envisioned the details of romantic scenes  
After midnight in the stillness of the barracks latrine.  
  
[Repeat chorus:]  
Hot love, cold love, no love at all.  
A portrait of guilt is hung on the wall.  
Nothing is wrong, nothing is right.  
Donald and lydia made love that night.  
  
(spoken:)  
Love  
The made love in the mountains, they made love in the streams,  
They made love in the valleys, they made love in their dreams.  
But when they were finished there was nothing to say,  
'cause mostly they made love from ten miles away.  
  
[Repeat chorus:]

Her father was a failure, her mother was a comfort to a doctor  
And lawyer and Indian chief, the shirt ran out of buttons  
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game and they went on relief  
The bank took away their diplomas, they locked them up inside  
Of the chest and she moved away to Oklahoma  
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast, God damn  
My socks are still hard from lying on the sofa on the night  
She was over in my backyard, yeah, we was shooting the breeze out  
Amongst the trees when a shot rang low and left her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Father have mercy, get her a nurse please, she's almost alone  
I saw her hand reaching out for the telephone, we rather see her  
Locked up inside a home than see her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Headlights flashing on her skirt in the wind, yonder comes a truck  
It drove by two men, shotgun man leaned out and said  
"Do you want to take a ride?" Out in the pale moonlight light  
Light light lie lie lie lie  
Too long in the hot sun, she could've be miss Wisconsin  
A long time ago, spent to much time inside of the early show  
We'd bought her a ticket but she didn't want to go she was standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Headlights flashing, caught a skirt in the wind, yonder comes a truck  
It drove by two men, shotgun man leaned out and said  
"Do you want to take a ride?" Out in through the pale moonlight  
Her father was a failure, her mother was a comfort to a doctor  
And lawyer and Indian chief, the shirt ran out of buttons  
He lost all his marbles at a baseball game and they went on relief  
The bank took away their diplomas, they locked them up inside  
Of the chest and she moved away to Oklahoma  
And got a tattoo on the side of her breast, God damn  
My socks are still hard from lying on the sofa on the night  
She was over in my backyard, yeah, we was shooting the breeze out  
Amongst the trees, when a shot rang low and left her standing  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  
Down by the side of the road, down by the side of the road  

While out sailing on the ocean  
While out sailing on the sea  
I bumped into the Saviour  
And He said pardon me  
I said Jesus you look tired  
He said Jesus so do you  
Sit down son  
Cause I got some fat to chew  
  
[Chorus]  
Everybody needs somebody that they can talk to  
Someone to open up their ears  
And let that trouble through  
Now you don't have to sympathize  
Or care what they may do  
But everybody needs somebody that they can talk to  
  
Well he spoke to me of morality  
Starvation, pain and sin  
Matter of fact the whole dang time  
I only got a few words in  
But I won't squack  
Let 'em talk  
Hell it's been a long long time  
And any friend that's been turned down  
Is bound to be a friend of mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now we sat there for an hour or two  
Just eatin' that Gospel pie  
When around the bend come a terrible wind  
And lightning lit the sky  
He said so long son I gotta run  
Appreciate you listening to me  
And I believe I heard him sing these words  
As he skipped out across the sea  
  
[Chorus]

Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away  
  
Across the sea to an island  
While the bridges brightly burn  
So far away from my land  
The valley of the unconcerned  
  
I was walking down the road, man  
Just looking at my shoes  
When God sent me an angel  
Just to chase away my blues  
  
I saw a hundred thousand blackbirds  
Just flying through the sky  
And they seemed to form a teardrop  
From a black haired angel's eye  
  
That tear fell all around me  
And it washed my sins away  
Now everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
  
Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away  
  
And I find it real surprising  
For myself to hear me say  
That everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
Everything is cool  
Everything's okay  
  
Why just before last Christmas  
My baby went away.

As the cafe was closing  
On a warm summer night  
And Cathy was cleaning the spoons  
The radio played the hit parade  
And I hummed a long with the tune  
She asked me to change the station  
Said the song just drove her insane  
But it weren't just the music playing  
It was me that she was trying to blame  
  
[Chorus:]  
And the sky is black and still now  
On the hill where the angels sing  
Ain't it funny how an old broken bottle  
Looks just like a diamond ring  
But it's far, far from me  
  
Well, I leaned on my left leg  
In the parking lot dirt  
And Cathy was closing the lights  
A June bug flew from the warmth he once knew  
And I wished for once I weren't right  
Why we used to laugh together  
And we'd dance to any old song  
Well, ya know, she still laughs with me  
But she waits just a second to long  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Well, I started the engine  
And I gave it some gas  
And Cathy was closing her purse  
Well, we hadn't gone far in my beat old car  
And I was prepared for the worst.  
"Will you still see me tomorrow?"  
"No, I got too much to do"  
Well, a question ain't really a question  
If you know the answer too  
  
[Chorus:]

I been thinking lately  
About the people I meet  
The carwash on the corner  
And the hole in the street  
The way my ankles hurt  
With shoes on my feet  
And I'm wondering  
If I'm gonna see tomorrow.  
  
Father forgive us  
For what we must do  
You forgive us  
We'll forgive you  
We'll forgive each other  
Till we both turn blue  
Then we'll whistle and go fishing  
In heaven.  
  
I was in the army  
But I never dug a trench  
I used to bust my knuckles  
On a monkey wrench  
Then I'd go to town and drink  
And give the girls a pinch  
But I don't think  
They ever even noticed me.  
  
Fish and whistle  
Whistle and fish  
Eat everything  
That they put on your dish  
And when we get through  
We'll make a big wish  
That we never have  
To do this again  
Again? again????  
  
On my very first job  
I said thank you and please  
They made me scrub a parking lot  
Down on my knees  
Then I got fired  
For being scared of bees  
And they only give me  
Fifty cents an hour.

Forbidden Jimmy  
Has got a mighty sore tooth  
From biting too many dimes  
In a telephone booth  
He's got half of his boot lace  
Tied to the dial  
Well thank you operator  
For getting Jimmy to smile  
"Call out the coast guard"  
Screamed the police  
Forbidden Jimmy  
He's got three water skis  
He put two on his wavelength  
And gave one to his girl  
She's a mighty fine person  
It's a mighty fine world  
I'm gonna make all your sorrows bright  
Set your soul free  
I'll see you tomorrow night  
If I can still see  
Ginger Caputo  
And Dorian Gray  
Oughta stay out of pictures  
If they got nothin' to say  
Stack 'em back on the rack Jack  
Ya know, you're hurting my eye  
Forbidden Jimmy  
He's getting ready to fly  
Gonna make all your sorrows bright  
Set your soul free  
I'll see you tomorrow night  
If I can still see  
I got caught cooking popcorn  
And calling it hail  
They wanna stick my head  
Inside a water pail  
Ya know, they're gonna be sorry  
They're gonna pay for it too  
Forbidden jimmy  
He's coming straight at you  

Oh, the glory of true love  
Is a wild and precious thing  
It don't grow on old magnolias  
Or only blossom in the spring  
No, the glory of true love  
Is it will last your whole life through  
Never will go out of fashion  
Always will look good on you  
You can climb the highest mountain  
Touch the moon and stars above  
But old faithful's just a fountain  
Compared to the glory of true love  
Long before I met you, darlin'  
Lord, I thought I had it all  
I could have my lunch in London  
And my dinner in St. Paul  
I got some friends in Albuquerque  
Where the governor calls me "Gov"  
You can give 'em all to goodwill  
For the glory of true love  
You can climb the highest mountain  
Touch the moon and stars above  
But old faithful's just a fountain  
Compared to the glory of true love  
Glory, glory, glory, glory  
You can't never get enough  
Time alone will tell the story  
Of the glory of true love  
Glory, glory, glory, glory  
You can't never get enough  
Time alone will tell the story  
Of the glory of true love  

Grandpa wore his suit to dinner  
Nearly every day  
No particular reason  
He just dressed that way  
  
Brown necktie and a matching vest  
And both his wingtip shoes  
He built a closet on our back porch  
And put a penny in a burned out fuse.  
  
[Chorus]  
Grandpa was a carpenter  
He built houses stores and banks  
Chain smoked Camel cigarettes  
And hammered nails in planks  
He was level on the level  
And shaved even every door  
And voted for Eisenhower  
'Cause Lincoln won the war.  
  
Well, he used to sing me "Blood on the Saddle"  
And rock me on his knee  
And let me listen to radio  
Before we got T.V.  
  
Well, he'd drive to church on Sunday  
And take me with him too!  
Stained glass in every window  
Hearing aids in every pew.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now my grandma was a teacher  
Went to school in Bowling Green  
Traded in a milking cow  
For a Singer sewing machine  
  
She called her husband "Mister"  
And walked real tall and pride  
And used to buy me comic books  
After grandpa died.  
  
[Chorus]

The motel lights were blinkin'  
On my chartreuse four door Lincoln  
On the dock the fish were stinkin'  
I simply didn't have a care  
  
And the old men sit 'round the cracker barrels  
The children hum their Christmas carols  
The train tracks all run parallel  
But they'll all meet up one day  
  
On a dusty pew in a vestibule  
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool  
He's waiting for the next poor fool  
Who forgot that it was Sunday  
  
We used to tell each other lies  
With our orange plastic button eyes  
In a former life on a motel chair  
I was Charlie Parker's teddy bear  
  
Yeah, me and Bird we'd stay up late  
I used to watch him contemplate  
While his horn would sit by the window and  
Wait till it was time for him to blow it  
  
On a dusty pew in a vestibule  
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool  
He's waiting for the next poor fool  
Who forgot that it was Sunday  
  
The only song I ever knew  
Was "Moonlight Bay on the Avenue"  
These are the tales from the Devil's chin  
Charlie I could've been a contender  
  
And the old men sit round the cracker barrels  
The children hum their Christmas carols  
The train tracks all run parallel  
But they'll all meet up one day  
  
On a dusty pew in a vestibule  
Sits the Devil playing pocket pool  
He's waiting for the next poor fool  
Who forgot that it was Sunday  
Who forgot that it was Sunday.

There's a rainbow of babies  
Draped over the graveyard  
Where all the dead sailors  
Wait for their brides  
And the cold bitter snow  
Has strangled each grass blade  
Where the salt from their tears  
Washed out with the tide  
And I smiled on the Wabash  
The last time I passed it  
Yes, I gave her a wink  
From the passenger side  
And my foot fell asleep  
As I swallowed my candy  
Knowing he was in Heaven  
Before he died  
Now a harbor's on fire  
With the dreams and desires  
Of a thousand young poets  
Who failed 'cause they tried  
For a rhyme without reason  
Floats down to the bottom  
Where the scavengers eat 'em  
And wash in with the tide  
And I smiled on the Wabash  
The last time I passed it  
Yes, I gave her a wink  
From the passenger side  
And my foot fell asleep  
As I swallowed my candy  
Knowing he was in Heaven  
Before he died  
The sun can play tricks  
With your eyes on the highway  
The moon can lay sideways  
Till the ocean stands still  
But a person can't tell  
His best friend he loves him  
Till time has stopped breathing  
You're alone on the hill  
And I smiled on the Wabash  
The last time I passed it  
Yes, I gave her a wink  
From the passenger side  
And my foot fell asleep  
As I swallowed my candy  
Knowing he was in Heaven  
Before he died  

We had an apartment in the city  
Me and Loretta liked living there  
Well, it'd been years since the kids had grown  
A life of their own left us alone  
John and Linda live in Omaha  
And Joe is somewhere on the road  
We lost Davy in the Korean war  
And I still don't know what for, don't matter anymore  
  
Chorus:  
Ya' know that old trees just grow stronger  
And old rivers grow wilder ev'ry day  
Old people just grow lonesome  
Waiting for someone to say, "Hello in there, hello"  
  
Me and Loretta, we don't talk much more  
She sits and stares through the back door screen  
And all the news just repeats itself  
Like some forgotten dream that we've both seen  
Someday I'll go and call up Rudy  
We worked together at the factory  
But what could I say if asks "What's new?"  
"Nothing, what's with you? Nothing much to do"  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
So if you're walking down the street sometime  
And spot some hollow ancient eyes  
Please don't just pass 'em by and stare  
As if you didn't care, say, "Hello in there, hello"

Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah, shook my head and made myself a bet  
There was all these things that I don't think I remember  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
I bronzed my shoes and hung from a rearview mirror  
Bronzed admiration in the blind spot of regret  
There was all these things that I don't think I remember  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah, scratched my head and lit my cigarette  
Well, there was all these things that I don't think I remember  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
Today I walked down the street I use to wander  
Yeah, shook my head and made myself a bet  
There was all these things that I don't think I remember  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
Hey, how lucky can one man get.  
Hey, how lucky can  
One ..  
Man..  
Get.  

Does he still think about her  
Why there was never really any doubt  
Every time he lights a candle  
Or blows a candle out  
The scientific nature of the ordinary man  
Is to go on out and do the best you can  
  
I don't think that you know  
That I think you don't know  
That old barometer goes crazy baby  
Every time it starts to snow  
You won't find me walking  
Round your part of town  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
  
This world is full of people  
They never seem to fall  
Somebody said they seen you  
You hadn't changed at all  
The fundamental story  
Of the contemporary man  
Is to walk away and someday understand  
  
I don't think that you know  
That I think you don't know  
That old barometer goes crazy baby  
Every time it starts to snow  
You won't find me walking  
Round your part of town  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
  
The scientific nature of the ordinary man  
Is to go on out and do the best you can  
  
I don't think that you know  
That I think you don't know  
That old barometer goes crazy baby  
Every time it starts to snow  
You won't find me walking  
Round your part of town  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
  
Humidity built the snowman  
Sunshine brought him down  
Brought him down

I had a dream last night  
Last night I had a dream  
Everything was black and white  
And it smelled like gasoline  
We stood in the corner  
And I held you tight  
I kissed your mouth  
Till my head got light  
Last night when I had a dream  
I had a dream last night  
Last night I had a dream  
Birds were flying left and right  
Through the light of a movie screen  
Everyone was looking  
For something to do  
I even thought  
I had a chance with you  
Last night when I had a dream  

I don't want to be the kind to hesitate  
Be too shy, wait to late  
I don't care what they say other lovers do  
I just want to dance with you  
I got a feeling that you have a heart like mine,  
So let it show, let it shine  
Oh, if we have change to make one heart of two  
Then I just want to dance with you  
  
Chorus:  
I want to dance with you  
Twirl you all around the floor  
That's what they invented dancing for,  
I just want to dance with you  
I want to dance with you  
Hold you in my arms once more  
That's what they invented dancing for,  
I just want to dance with you  
  
I caught you lookin' at me when I looked at you  
Yes, I did, ain't that true  
You won't get embarrassed by the things I do  
I just want to dance with you  
Oh, the boys are playing softly and the girls are too  
So am I, and so are you  
If this was a movie then we're right on cue  
I just want to dance with you  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
Repeat chorus:  
  
Ending:  
I just want to dance with you  
I just want to dance with you  
I just want to dance with you

When all your loves have ended  
When all your friends have flown  
Who'll be around to want you  
When all your loves have gone  
Only a fool would do it  
After the way you've done  
But how many fools would have you I know one  
  
This fool keeps wonderin' why  
He fell in love at all  
But you might need this fool  
Around in case you fall  
  
After the party's over  
And you've had your fill of fun  
If you need a fool to forgive you I know one  
  
You never know, you might be lonely  
When all your loves have missed  
It wouldn't hurt to keep an extra  
Fool on your list.  
  
After your heart's been broken  
And you need a place to run  
If you'll take a fool who loves you  
I know one  
I know one  
I know one

I love you so much it hurts me  
Darling that's why I'm so blue  
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night  
Afraid of losing you  
I love you so much it hurts me  
And there's nothing I can do  
I want to hold you my dear  
Forever and ever  
  
I love you so much it hurts me so  
I love you so much it hurts me  
And there's nothing I can do  
I want to hold you my dear  
Forever and ever  
  
I want to hold you my dear  
Forever and ever  
  
I love you so much it hurts me so

Christmas toys all over the place  
Little Johnny wears a funny smile on his face  
Johnny has a secret, and a secret he must share  
He wants to tell somebody, so he tells his Teddy Bear  
  
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
Well, she didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
She though that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
Then I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
What a laugh it would have been  
If Daddy had walked in  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night  
  
I saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe last night  
Well, she didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
She though that I was tucked up in my bedroom fast asleep  
But I know I saw Mommy tickle Santa Claus  
Underneath his beard so snowy white  
What a laugh it would have been  
If Daddy had walked in  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night (One more time!)  
And saw Mommy kissing Santa Claus last night  
On the Lips!

I lose my blues  
Only when I'm with you  
No one else can do  
You're in my heart to stay  
And when I'm gone and I'm all alone  
I'll be singing this song  
I want to be with you always  
  
I'd be happy dear  
If you could only be here  
And always be near you  
Forever and a day  
Then we'd travel far to some big shining star  
Just you and my guitar  
And stay there sweetheart for always  
  
I hope you feel the same  
You really want my name  
You'll be the one who's to blame  
If it works out wrong that day  
'Cause my love is true, my love's only for you  
I would never be blue  
If I can be with you always  
Then we'd travel far to some big shining star  
Just you and my guitar  
And stay there sweetheart for always

If I could make my living going fishing  
Then I would make my living with a line and pole  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money going fishing  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
If I could pay all these bills with my guitar  
Then I would pay these bills with some rock and roll  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money playing guitar Like I'm paid at the factory  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now if I could (if I could)  
Then I would (then I would)  
Make money doing something that I love  
I'd thank my lucky stars above  
  
If I could just get by loving you dear  
Then I would just get by making love to you  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could make my living going fishing  
Then I would make my living with a line and pole  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money going fishing  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I could just get by loving you dear  
Then I would just get by making love to you  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory  
Put food on the table pay the money to the landlord  
Buy some working clothes  
'Cause I ain't making money making love  
Like I'm paid at the factory.

If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
I know who  
I'll give it to  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
Anymore.  
  
If you don't want the thrill  
If you don't want the thrill  
If you don't want the thrill  
I know who  
I know who will  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
Anymore.  
  
If that's the way that the world goes round  
Then that's the way  
That it all comes down  
And when you want me  
I won't be around  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
I know who  
I'll give it to  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
If you don't want my love  
Anymore.

When I woke up this morning, things were lookin' bad  
Seem like total silence was the only friend I had  
Bowl of oatmeal tried to stare me down... and won  
And it was twelve o'clock before I realized  
That I was havin' no fun  
  
[Chorus]  
But fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone  
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun  
  
Last time I checked my bankroll,  
It was gettin' thin  
Sometimes it seems like the bottom  
Is the only place I've been  
I Chased a rainbow down a one-way street dead end  
And all my friends turned out to be insurance salesmen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I sat down in my closet with all my overalls  
Tryin' to get away  
From all the ears inside my walls  
I dreamed the police heard  
Everything I thought... what then?  
Well I went to court  
And the judge's name was Hoffman  
  
Ah but fortunately I have the key to escape reality  
And you may see me tonight with an illegal smile  
It don't cost very much, but it lasts a long while  
Won't you please tell the man I didn't kill anyone  
No I'm just tryin' to have me some fun  
Well done, hot dog bun, my sister's a nun

In a town this size, there's no place to hide  
Everywhere you go you meet someone you know  
You can't steal a kiss in a place like this  
How the rumors do fly in a town this size  
In a smokey bar in the backseat of your car  
In your own little house someone's sure to find you out  
What you do and what you think  
What you eat and what you drink  
If you smoke a cigarette they'll be talkin' about your breath  
  
In a town this size, there's no place to hide  
Everywhere you go you meet someone you know  
You can't steal a kiss in a place like this  
How the rumors do fly in a town this size  
  
Oh, I had a fight with my girlfriend last night  
Before the moon went down it was all over town  
How he made me cry how I said goodbye  
If it's true or not doesn't seem to count alot  
  
In a town this size, there's no place to hide  
Everywhere you go you meet someone you know  
You can't steal a kiss in a place like this  
How the rumors do fly in a town this size  
In a town this size In a town this size

She don't like her eggs all runny  
She thinks crossin' her legs is funny  
She looks down her nose at money  
She gets it on like the Easter Bunny  
She's my baby  
I'm her honey  
I'm never gonna let her go  
  
He ain't got laid in a month of Sundays  
I caught him once and he was sniffin' my undies  
He ain't too sharp but he gets things done  
Drinks his beer like it's oxygen  
He's my baby  
And I'm his honey  
Never gonna let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
In spite of ourselves  
We'll end up a'sittin' on a rainbow  
Against all odds  
Honey, we're the big door prize  
We're gonna spite our noses  
Right off of our faces  
There won't be nothin' but big old hearts  
Dancin' in our eyes.  
  
She thinks all my jokes are corny  
Convict movies make her horny  
She likes ketchup on her scrambled eggs  
Swears like a sailor when shaves her legs  
She takes a lickin'  
And keeps on tickin'  
I'm never gonna let her go.  
  
He's got more balls than a big brass monkey  
He's a wacked out weirdo and a love bug junkie  
Sly as a fox and crazy as a loon  
Payday comes and he's howlin' at the moon  
He's my baby  
I don't mean maybe  
Never gonna let him go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In spite of ourselves

Up in the morning  
Work like a dog  
Is better than sitting  
Like a bump on a log  
Mind all your manners  
Be quiet as a mouse  
Some day you'll own a home  
That's as big as a house  
  
I know a fella  
He eats like a horse  
Knocks his old balls  
Round the old golf course  
You oughta see his wife  
She's a cute little dish  
She smokes like a chimney  
And drinks like a fish  
  
There's a big old goofy man  
Dancing with a big old goofy girl  
Ooh baby  
It's a big old goofy world  
  
Now Elvis had a woman  
With a head like a rock  
I wished I had a woman  
That made my knees knock  
She'd sing like an angel  
And eat like a bird  
And if I wrote a song  
She'd know ever single word  
  
Kiss a little baby  
Give the world a smile  
If you take an inch  
Give 'em back a mile  
Cause if you lie like a rug  
And you don't give a damn  
You're never gonna be  
As happy as a clam  
  
So I'm sitting in a hotel  
Trying to write a song  
My head is just as empty  
As the day is long  
Why it's clear as a bell  
I should have gone to school  
I'd be wise as an owl  
Stead of stubborn as a mule.

You and me, sittin' in the back of my memory  
Like a honey bee buzzin' 'round a glass of sweet Chablis  
Radio's on, windows rolled up and my mind's rolled down  
Headlights shining like silver moon's rollin' on the ground  
We made love in every way love can be made  
And we made time, look like time could never fade  
Friday Night, we both made the guitar hum  
Saturday made Sunday feel like it would never come  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again  
Soul to soul, heart to heart and cheek to cheek  
Now, come on, baby, give me a kiss that'll last all week  
The thought of you leavin' again brings me down  
The promise of your sweet love brings me around  
Gonna be a long Monday  
Sittin' all alone on a mountain by a river that has no end  
It's gonna be a long Monday  
Stuck like the tick of a clock that's come unwound again and again  

I can't work late  
Although I need the money  
Gotta get home to my lovin' honey  
She'll be there waitin'  
Waitin' impatiently  
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll  
  
Ah, love is on a roll  
Ah, love is on a good roll  
  
I'm a songwriter  
A professional dreamer  
Mostly a singer but sometimes a screamer  
I should know  
If anybody knows at all  
When love is on a roll, love is on a good roll  
  
So I gotta go. I gotta get home early  
Be with my woman soft and curvy  
Makes me feel like a king and not a regular joe  
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll  
Love is on a roll, love is on a good roll

He stumbled through the alley with his long coat on  
Nothing but a bottle in his hand  
She sat in her apartment lonesome to the bone  
Wondering what had happened to her man  
  
[Chorus:]  
Love, love, love, love  
Nobody ever understands  
All the things that go,  
Between a woman and a man.  
  
When they'd walk down the sidewalk the street would shine  
With the kind of love no human heart can fake  
And they vowed to stay together till the end of time  
Like the couple that stands on top of the wedding cake  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I should live to a ripe old age  
The only lesson I may ever learn  
Is to not stand so close to the flame of love  
Unless you are willing to get burned  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the things that go,  
Between a woman and a man.

Maureen, Maureen,  
I shot a doctor last night on the airplane  
Well, they said he wouldn't hurt us  
But he got me real nervous and mean  
He was fat and he stank  
And God knows that he drank more than we do  
So I shot him in the first class  
Then I bailed out and ran home to you  
  
[Chorus]  
But you don't believe me  
I could tell by your smile  
Honey, why don't you leave me  
Get lost for awhile, Maureen.  
Maureen, Maureen,  
  
There's a hole in between where we come from  
And the things that I'm thinking  
Ain't necessary the things that I say  
I may have lied to myself  
But I tried to tell God how I love you  
But even He don't answer  
His phone anymore when I pray  
Maureen, Maureen,  
I shot a doctor last night on the airplane  
Well, they said he wouldn't hurt us  
But he got me real nervous and mean  
Real nervous and mean

Well, tonight I'll throw a party  
And I know who I'll invite  
There's a strange and lonely person  
With whom I'll spend this night  
There'll be no old sad memories  
To haunt me till I die  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
I've been introduced to many  
People I don't understand  
I've been in the house of lonely.  
I've shook a thousand shaking hands  
But tonight I'll be with someone  
Who will look me in the eye  
And in that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I  
At that party you'll see me when I was just a child  
In a room full of happy with a heart so meek and mild  
And that child will meet a ghost that will haunt him oh so bad  
From a family of confusion pretending love they never had.  
So, tonight I'll throw that party  
And I know just what I'll do  
Yes, I'll meet myself at midnight  
And cry the whole night through  
Yeah, I'll meet that ghost of sadness  
And he'll look me in the eye  
And in that room there'll be that bottle  
And me, myself and I  
In that room there'll be a bottle  
And me, myself and I

I was sitting in a diner  
With a girl named Flo  
She wouldn't say yes  
But she couldn't say no  
She said, ?Darling, can I get a middle man??  
She was engaged to a fellow  
On the lay a way plan  
But she carried all her money  
In a coffee can  
She said, ?Darling, can I get a middle man??  
The cook looked over  
With a short order face  
Dropped a fork  
And he saw Flo's legs  
Straightened his apron  
And burnt my eggs  
I got competition  
Everywhere I go  
These days  
She was leaning on the juke box  
And was lookin' real good  
Like Natalie Wood  
On a Pontiac hood  
I said, ?Darling, I think I need a little hand?  
Ya see, I've seen my downs  
I've seen my ups  
I seen miniature dogs  
In coffee cups  
But ?Darling I ain't never seen a middle man?  
Flo talked slow  
Like real wet paint  
She said, ?A middle man's there  
When the other ones ain't  
He's got a left handed manner  
That leans to the right, sleeps all day  
And keeps it up all night?  
I got an aunt in Ohio  
And a boat that won't row  
Some veterans insurance  
And nowhere to go  
?Darling, Can I be your middle man?  
If I could get the money in that coffee can?  
I could open me up a lemonade stand  
Send all the kids off to Pakistan  
Make flo happy  
If I can  
Jerry Mahoney and Johnny B. Goode  
Are gonna buy me a house in Hollywood  
Darling I think, I got the perfect plan  
We're gonna save half a dollars  
And sell 'em to France  
Buy us a record  
And learn how to dance  
And darling, I'll always be your middle  
Darling, go buy a griddle  
Darling, I wanna be your middle man  

I saw you all dolled up  
Singing a song in your pickup truck  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
Hey, hey, Brother Ray  
What'd you mean by, what'd I say  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
If it's gonna rain and I wish that it would  
Just go ahead and rain, get it over for good  
If there's really a hole in that big blue sky  
Then move it on over and let me by  
  
Constantinople is a mighty long word  
Got three more letters than mockingbird  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train  
  
I like you with your make-up on  
All dolled up singing a song  
You put me on a morning train  
You put me on a morning train  
Ain't no need to explain  
You put me on a morning train

Far away over the sea  
There's a river that's calling to me  
That river she runs all around  
The place that I call my hometown  
There's a valley on the side of the hill  
And flowers on an old windowsill  
A familiar old picture it seems  
And I'll go there tonight in my dreams  
Where it's green in the summer  
And gold in the fall  
Her eyes are as blue  
As the sky I recall  
Far away over the sea  
There's a place at the table for me  
Where laughter and music abound  
Just waiting there in my hometown  
The river she freezes  
When there's snow on the ground  
And the children can slide  
To the far side of town  
Far away far away me  
Hung up on a sweet memory  
I'm lost and I wish I were found  
In the arms of my darlin' hometown  
With the evening sun sittin'  
On the top of the hill  
And the mockingbird answering  
The old chapel bell  
Far away over the sea  
My heart is longing to be  
And I wish I could lay myself down  
In the arms of my darlin' hometown  

I'm beginning to like you  
But, you know that ain't right  
'Cause you'll just twist and twist and twist  
Till I'm all crooked inside  
You'll take all you gave me  
Like it never was there  
And I think that I might, no, I know  
Yes, I will help you there  
'Cause, I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend  
I'm a victim of friction, I got too close to see  
Yeah, we sparked in the dark and God hung a light on me  
The lamp gets real heavy, it hangs from my heart  
And it comes and it goes till I can't tell the difference apart  
But I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend  
So many people say, it will never work out that way  
You can't stand the heat  
While you're watching your heart  
Just melt away in the basement on a rainy day  
There's motel in Shreveport  
Don't ask me where, please  
They check in, they check out  
By the light of the color T.V.s  
The maid calls you honey  
She makes your bed slow  
And she speaks, of the sheets that don't fit  
But you know that she knows  
I've done it before and I'd do it again  
'Cause it's the only time  
That makes me feel like I'm  
My own best friend, my own best friend  
My own best friend, my own best friend  

Full blown silence in an empty room  
A former bride and a former groom  
A folding table and a folding chair  
A folded hand of poker there  
All new directions must go everywhere  
Big round people in a cool little square  
You can't cut it with a boat or a plane  
Man it's gonna take a new train  
  
You'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
And when you look out your window you'll see  
Your home your baby and your family  
No melted ice cube in a paper cup  
Hell you'll be happy you'll be all shook up  
The friends that greet you will be  
Simple and plain  
When you step down from that new train  
  
Collected volumes of history say  
Man makes mistakes most everyday  
The half a pound of chopped ground round  
Is still a burger when it goes downtown  
No faded photographs of yesterdays  
Are in the books that I read these days  
To fly away from that memory town  
You must keep both your feet on the ground  
  
Cause you'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
And when you look out your window you'll see  
Your home your baby and your family  
No melted ice cube in a paper cup  
Hell you'll be happy you'll be all shook up  
The friends that greet you will be  
Simple and plain  
When you step down from that new train  
  
I'll be leaving on a new train  
Far away from this world of pain  
The friends that greet me will be  
Simple and plain  
When I step down from that new train  
New train, new train.

I got a girl that ain't got no home  
She ain't very fat just skin and bones  
She don't cast no shadow because she's so thin  
Never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She Never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
  
The girl I love ain't got no name  
But I love her just the same  
She's a little peculiar but it ain't no sin  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
Never know where she going but she knows were she's been  
  
She's six feet tall and got long black hair  
Runs around in her sack dress but I don't care  
She got great big feet with size number 10  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
  
The girl I love ain't got no name  
But I love her just the same  
She's a little peculiar but it ain't no sin  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She never know where she going but know were she's been  
She never knows where she going but she knows were she's been  
She never know where she going  
She never knows where she going  
She never know where she going  
She never knows where she going  
She never know where she going now  
But she know were she's been ugh  
She never know where she going  
Never know where she going  
But I know were she's been.

I know that you're sad  
I know that you're lonely  
You lie awake 'till way past when  
I want you to know  
  
That I'm leaving you only  
'Cause I might not get the chance again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm cold and I'm tired  
And I can't stop coughing  
Long enough to tell you all of the news  
I'd like to tell you  
That I'll see you more often  
But often is a word I seldom use  
Often is a word I seldom use.  
  
Tell me, where did the weekend go?  
Tell me, where did the weekend go?  
Went like thunder, felt like snow.  
Went like thunder, felt like snow.  
  
You must think my life's a circus  
Watching me laughing  
And slapping my thighs  
How'd ya like to die  
  
In the house of mirrors  
With nobody around to close your eyes.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Going down to the Greyhound station  
Going back home  
And get what's mine  
Got me a date  
  
With the ten o'clock special  
Gonna be there at a quarter to nine.  
  
[Chorus]

The rain came down on the tin roof  
Hardly a sound was left from the birthday party  
The kitchen light fell asleep on the bedroom floor  
Me and her were talking softer  
Than all the time before I lost her  
Picture sat on top of the chest of drawers  
One red rose in the Bible  
Pressed between the holy alphabet  
Probably wouldn't believe you if you told me  
But what I never knew I never will forget  
Rainy nights get dark real early  
Her dress was soft and her hair was curly  
We danced around the table to the old banjo  
Rainy nights were made for lovers  
We lay there still beneath the covers  
And I ain't never felt like that before  
One red rose in the Bible  
Pressed between the holy alphabet  
Probably wouldn't believe you if you told me  
But what I never knew I never will forget  
One red rose in the Bible  
Pressed between the holy alphabet  
Probably wouldn't believe you if you told me  
But what I never knew I never will forget  
What I never knew I never will forget  

You may live alone and close your eyes  
Some folks do  
You may dream a dream that's twice your size  
All night through  
When the morning comes who's to tell your dreams to  
Only you  
  
[Chorus]  
Only love, love only, only love  
Will do  
Only love, love only, only love  
Comes true  
Nothing else, you see, there nothing else  
Only love, only love  
  
I have known a love within my heart  
One or two  
Where one love would end and one would start  
I never knew  
If love should come your way you'll learn to say  
I love you I love you  
  
[Chorus x 2]

Forty-five minutes  
Forty-five cents  
Sixty-five agents sitting on a fence  
Singing, hey brother  
  
Look what we got for you  
We're gonna rope off an area  
And put on a show  
From the Canadian border  
  
Down to Mexico  
It might be the most  
Potentially gross  
Thing that we could possibly do  
  
Yeah, little buddy gonna get your chance  
Make them pubescents all wet their pants  
We'll record it live  
And that's no jive.  
  
Hold it! Stop it! No! No! No! No!  
Bang! went the pistol.  
Crash! went the window.  
Ouch! went the son of a gun.  
  
Onomatopoeia  
I don't want to see ya  
Speaking in a foreign tongue.  
Knock! Knock! Hello!  
  
Can I come in?  
Gee, that was a wonderful show!  
Oh, you haven't gone on yet?  
Well, how was I supposed to know?  
  
Hey! We got a great date  
It's really downtown  
We're gonna get the Grand Canyon  
To do the sound  
  
It's a boxing ring  
But it might be the thing  
To really put you in the dough  
Listen little brother, don't ya get us wrong  
  
Why we even know the words to your song  
Just say I do  
And we'll lay it on you  
You! You! And me! Me! Me!  
  
Bang! went the pistol  
Crash! Went the window  
Ouch! Went the son of a gun  
Onomatopoeia  
  
I don't want to see ya  
Speaking in a foreign tongue.

Why do you always seem to criticize me  
Seems like everything I do just turns out wrong  
Why don't you come on out and despise me  
So I could pack my bag and baby I'd be gone  
  
Remember when you used to call me honey  
I'd turn around and call you honey too  
You might think it's a joke, but it ain't funny  
To hurt someone who's so in love with you  
  
Chorus:  
A clown puts his makeup on upside down  
So he wears a smile even when he wears a frown  
You might think I'm here when you put me down  
But actually I'm on the other side of town.  
  
My body's in this room with you just catchin' hell  
While my soul is drinking beer down the road a spell  
You might think I'm listening to your grocery list  
But I'm leaning on the jukebox and I'm about halfway there  
  
I'm sittin' on a chair just behind my ear  
Playing dominoes and drinking some ice cold beer  
When you get done talking I'll come back downstairs  
And assume the body of the person you presume who cares  
  
Chorus  
  
I'm Across the river on the other side of town  
In my mind I'm on the other side of town

When I was a child my family would travel  
Down to Western Kentucky where my parents were born  
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered  
So many times that my memories are worn  
  
Chorus:  
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County  
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay  
Well, I'm sorry my son, but you're too late in asking  
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away  
Well, sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River  
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill  
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols  
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
Then the coal company came with the world's largest shovel  
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land  
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken  
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man  
  
Repeat Chorus:  
When I die let my ashes float down the Green River  
Let my soul roll on up to the Rochester dam  
I'll be halfway to Heaven with Paradise waitin'  
Just five miles away from wherever I am  
  
Repeat Chorus:

People who are sad - sometimes they wear a frown  
And people who are kings - sometimes they wear a crown  
But all the people who don't fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin' people down  
People puttin' people down  
  
People without love - sometimes build a fence around  
The garden up above - that makes the whole world go 'round  
But all the people who don't fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin' people down  
People puttin' people down  
  
So cold, sometimes it gets so cold  
  
You may love your wife - you may lose your family  
You may lose you mind - just to keep your sanity  
But the people who don't fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin' people down  
People puttin' people down  
  
People that are glad - sometimes they wear a smile  
And people without dreams they walk the extra mile  
But all the people who don't fit  
Get the only fun they get  
From people puttin' people down  
People puttin' people dwn  
From people puttin' people down  
People puttin' people down  
  
So cold, sometimes it gets so cold

A young man from a small town  
With a very large imagination  
Lay alone in his room with his radio on  
Looking for another station  
When the static from the mouthpiece  
Gave way to the sound below  
James Dean went out to Hollywood  
And put his picture in a Picture Show.  
James Dean went out to Hollywood  
And put his picture in a Picture Show.  
  
[Chorus]  
And it's oh Daddy get off of your knees  
Mamma why'd you have to go  
Your darling Jim is out a limb  
I put my picture in a Picture Show  
Whoa ho! Put my picture in a Picture Show  
  
Hamburgers cheeseburgers  
Wilbur and Orville Wright  
John Garfield in the afternoon  
Montgomery Clift at night  
When the static hit the mouthpiece  
Gave way to the sound below  
James Dean went out to Hollywood  
And put his picture in a picture show.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A Mocca man in a wigwam sitting on a Reservation.  
With a big black hole in the belly of his soul  
Waiting on an explanation  
While the white man sits on his fat can  
And takes pictures of the Navajo  
Every time he clicks his Kodak pics  
He steals a little bit of soul.  
Every time he clicks his Kodak pics  
He steals a little bit of soul.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yie Hi! Put my picture in a picture show  
Here we go!  
A young man from a small town  
With a very large imagination

Woke up this morning  
Put on my slippers  
Walked in the kitchen  
And died  
  
And oh, what a feeling!  
When my soul  
Went through the ceiling  
And on up into heaven, I did ride  
  
When I got there, they did say  
"John, it happened this way  
You slipped upon the floor  
And hit your head"  
  
And all the angels say  
"Just before you passed away  
That these were the very last words  
That you said"  
  
"Please don't bury me  
Down in that cold, cold ground  
No, I?d rather have 'em cut me up  
And pass me all around"  
  
"Throw my brain in a hurricane  
And the blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they don't mind the size"  
  
"Give my stomach to Milwaukee  
If they run out of beer  
Put my socks in a cedar box  
Just to get 'em out of here"  
  
"Venus De Milo can have my arms  
Look out! I've got your nose  
Sell my heart to the junk man  
And give my love to Rose"  
  
"But please don't bury me  
Down in that cold, cold ground  
I?d rather have 'em cut me up  
And pass me all around"  
  
"Throw my brain in a hurricane  
The blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they don't mind the size, oh man!"  
  
"Give my feet to the footloose  
Careless, fancy free  
And give my knees to the needy  
Don't pull that stuff on me"  
  
"Hand me down my walking cane  
It?s a sin to tell a lie  
Send my mouth way down south  
And kiss my ass goodbye"  
  
"But, please don't bury me  
Down in that cold, cold ground  
I?d rather have 'em cut me up  
And pass me all around"  
  
"Throw my brain in a hurricane  
And the blind can have my eyes  
And the deaf can take both of my ears  
If they don't mind the size, that's right"

I got a friend in Fremont  
He sells used cars, ya know  
Well, he calls me up twice a year  
Just ask me how'd it go  
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain  
Actually everything is just about the same  
I met a girl from Venus, and her insides were lined in gold  
Well, she did what she did said "How was it, kid?"  
She was politely told  
"Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain  
But actually everything is just about the same."  
Moonlight makes me dizzy  
Sunlight makes me clean  
Your light is the sweetest thing  
That this boy has ever seen  
Molly went to Arkansas, she got raped by Dobbin's dog  
Well, she was doing good till she went in the woods  
And got pinned up against a log  
Pretty good, not bad, she can't complain  
Cause actually all them dogs is just about the same  
Moonlight makes me dizzy  
Sunlight makes me clean  
Your light is the sweetest thing  
That this boy has ever seen  
I heard Allah and Buddha were singing at the Savior's feast  
And up the sky and Arabian rabbi  
Fed Quaker oats to a priest  
Pretty good, not bad, they can't complain  
Cause actually all them gods is just about the same  
Pretty good, not bad, I can't complain  
Cause actually everything is just about the same  

Station was empty  
Trains were all gone  
I reached in my pocket  
Waited for dawn  
The clock played drums  
And I hummed the sax  
And the wind whistled down  
The railroad tracks  
Hey three for a quarter  
One for a dime  
I'll bet it's tomorrow  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
I walked in the restaurant  
For something to do  
The waitress yelled at me  
So did the food  
And the water taste funny  
When you're far from your home  
But it's only the thirsty  
That hunger to roam  
And the clock played drums  
And I hummed the sax  
And the wind whistled down  
The railroad tracks  
Hey three for a quarter  
One for a dime  
I'll bet it's tomorrow  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
We'll build us a castle on Main Street  
And pretend that we're down on the farm  
Hell, we'll hold out as long as we have to  
Then we'll twist off each other's arm  
Christ, I'm so mixed up and lonely  
I can't even make friends with my brain  
Yeah, I'm too young to be where I'm goin'  
But I'm too old to go back again  
Station was empty  
Trains were all gone  
I reached in my pocket  
Waited for dawn  
The clock played drums  
And I hummed the sax  
And the wind whistled down  
The railroad tracks  
Hey three for a quarter  
One for a dime  
I'll bet it's tomorrow  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
By Rocky Mountain Time  
By Rocky Mountain Time  

The movie wasn't really doing so hot  
Said the new producer to the old big shot  
Its dying on the edge of the great midwest  
Sabu must tour or forever rest.  
Hey look ma  
Here comes the elephant boy  
Bundled all up in his corduroy  
Headed down south towards illinois  
From the jungles of east st. paul.  
His manager sat in the office alone  
Staring at the numbers on the telephone  
Wondering how a man could send a child actor  
To visit in the land of the wind chill factor.  
Sabu was sad the whole tour stunk  
The airlines lost the elephant's trunk  
The roadie got the rabies and the scabies and the flu  
They was low on morale but they was high on.  

I wish, I hope, I wonder  
Where you're at sometimes  
Is your back against the wall?  
Or just across the line  
Have you been standing in the rain  
Reciting nursery rhymes?  
Trying to recall  
Some long lost kind of peace of mind  
Peace of mind  
Try spending the night sometime  
All alone in a frozen room  
Afterneath you've lain  
Your Saddle in the rain  
  
I dreamed they locked God up  
Down in my basement  
And he waited there for me  
To have this accident  
So he could drink my wine  
And eat me like a sacrament  
And I just stood there like I do  
Then I came and went  
I came and went  
Like a bird in a foreign sky  
Couldn't even say good bye  
Or come and share the pain  
My Saddle's in the rain  
  
I saw a friend who doesn't know  
If I'm his friend just yet  
His eyes and mouth were widely open  
And his jaw was set  
Like he'd fell off a cliff  
And hadn't hit the bottom yet  
I wish he wouldn't pull those things on me  
Without a net  
Without a net  
I had him up to the house one time  
And we was having a real good time  
Then he went and lain  
His Saddle in the rain  
  
In a laundromat not too far  
From the Alamo  
Sits a girl who stole my records  
Very long ago  
And she wishes, wants and washes  
Out those dirty clothes  
As she shuts her eyes and dreams  
About her one eyed Joe  
One eyed Joe  
Car parked on a dirty road  
Heaven knows the load she pulled  
Couldn't take the strain  
A Saddle in the rain

Sailin' around, sailin' around, sailin' around,  
I've been out sailin' around again  
I've been sailin' around  
But I can't get back to you.  
Hangin' around, hangin' around, hangin' around  
I've been out hangin' around again  
I've been hangin' around  
But I can't get back to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
So tell where you been so long (sailin' around)  
What have I done so wrong? (sailin' around)  
Well, I'm so glad I finally found you  
I can't wait to put my arms around you  
Sailin' around, but I can't get back to you  
  
Shoppin' around, shoppin' around, shoppin' around,  
I've been shoppin' around again  
I've been shoppin' around  
But I can't get back to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sailin' around, sailin' around, sailin' around,  
I've been sailin' around again  
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.  
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.  
I've been sailin' around but I can't get back to you.

Sam Stone came home,  
To the wife and family  
After serving in the conflict overseas.  
And the time that he served,  
Had shattered all his nerves,  
And left a little shrapnel in his knees.  
But the morhpine eased the pain,  
And the grass grew round his brain,  
And gave him all the confidence he lacked,  
With a purple heart and a monkey on his back.  
  
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,  
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.  
Little pitchers have big ears,  
Don't stop to count the years,  
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.  
  
Sam Stone's welcome home  
Didn't last too long.  
He went to work when he'd spent his last dime  
And soon he took to stealing  
When he got that empty feeling  
For a hundred dollar habit without overtime.  
And the gold roared through his veins  
Like a thousand railroad trains,  
And eased his mind in the hours that he chose,  
While the kids ran around wearin' other peoples' clothes...  
  
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,  
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.  
Little pitchers have big ears,  
Don't stop to count the years,  
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.  
  
Sam Stone was alone  
When he popped his last balloon,  
Climbing walls while sitting in a chair.  
Well, he played his last request,  
While the room smelled just like death,  
With an overdose hovering in the air.  
But life had lost it's fun,  
There was nothing to be done,  
But trade his house that he bought on the GI bill,  
For a flag-draped casket on a local hero's hill.  
  
There's a hole in daddy's arm where all the money goes,  
Jesus Christ died for nothin I suppose.  
Little pitchers have big ears,  
Don't stop to count the years,  
Sweet songs never last too long on broken radios.

Moonlight shining on the back of my hand  
Cat fight rattlin' the garbage can  
Looks like somethin' chased you up a tree  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
  
Wild wind blowing down the neck of my shirt  
Old men sitting on a bench in the dirt  
Seems that another ship has gone out to sea  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
  
Shoe shine someone's got to tell ya the news  
A fine line separates a boy from the blues  
Looks like you could use some company  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
  
Runnin', runnin' just as fast as I can  
Someone, someone take a hold of my hand  
Looks like somethin' chased you up a tree  
Same thing, same thing happened to me  
Same thing, same thing happened to me.

She is my everything  
From her sun tanned shoulders  
Down to the freckles on her wedding ring  
Her feet is so warm  
They can melt the snow in the early spring  
She is my everything  
She goes everywhere  
From Copenhagen to makin' eggs and bacon  
Down in Jackson Square  
I?d like to drive a Cadillac  
The color of her long black hair  
She goes everywhere  
Kisses that come all the way from China  
Kinda remind her of memories of Spain  
If I get lost, you can always find her  
Standing right beside me in the rain  
She uses the Eveready  
Batteries to keep her electrical  
Appliances going steady  
She can do 14 things at once  
And then her phone?ll ring  
She is my everything  
She knows everybody  
From Muhammad Ali to teaching Bruce Lee  
How to do Karate  
She could lead a parade  
While puttin' on her shades in her Masaratti  
She knows everybody  
Kisses that come all the way from China  
Kinda remind her of memories of Spain  
If I get lost, you can always find her  
Standing right beside me in the rain  
She is my everything  
When she wakes up in the morning  
That's when the birdies start to sing  
When I hear her voice  
I?ll tell you boys, I forget everything  
She is my everything  
She is my everything  
Watch out  

I seen you in your pajamas  
Drinking coffee at the house of pies  
You was flipping for the check  
And talking like your tongue was paralyzed  
You were saying something  
That I don't understand  
Bout looking other places  
While you're holding my hand  
Let's stop  
Let's not  
Talk shop  
In front of all these guys  
Chorus:  
Let's not  
Talk shop  
Shop talk  
Shop talk is talking something  
That you don't realize  
Loose lips sink ships, shake hips  
Bad tips draw spies  
I want you when I can get you  
But you only want me on the rise  
Well I thought I had your number  
But your number's too loud  
Now you're standing on the table  
And we're drawing a crowd  
Let's stop  
Let's not  
Talk shop  
In front of all these spies  

City Sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there is a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Greeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you'll hear.  
  
Silver Bells, Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
  
Strings of streetlights even Stop Lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Here the snow crunch, see the kids bunch  
It Santa's big day  
And above all the hustle you'll hear  
  
Silver Bells, Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
  
Silver Bells, Silver Bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.  
Soon it will be Christmas Day.

On a junk boat to thailand with your hand in mine hand

Some humans ain't human  
Some people ain't kind  
You open up their hearts  
And here's what you'll find  
A few frozen pizzas  
Some ice cubes with hair  
A broken Popsicle  
You don't want to go there  
  
Some humans ain't human  
Though they walk like we do  
They live and they breathe  
Just to turn the old screw  
They screw you when you're sleeping  
They try to screw you blind  
Some humans ain't human  
Some people ain't kind  
  
You might go to church  
And sit down in a pew  
Those humans who ain't human  
Could be sittin' right next to you  
They talk about your family  
They talk about your clothes  
When they don't know their own ass  
From their own elbows  
  
Jealousy and stupidity  
Don't equal harmony  
Jealousy and stupidity  
Don't equal harmony  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
Mm Mm  
  
Have you ever noticed  
When you're feeling really good  
There's always a pigeon  
That'll come shit on your hood  
  
Or you're feeling your freedom  
And the world's off your back  
Some cowboy from Texas  
Starts his own war in Iraq  
  
Some humans ain't human  
Some people ain't kind  
They lie through their teeth  
With their head up their behind  
You open up their hearts  
And here's what you'll find  
Some humans ain't human  
Some people ain't kind

Robert was a sailor  
For the best years of his life  
His captain was his mother  
And the ocean was his wife  
Only fresh out of the cradle  
Life's one and only spring  
He was sworn to do his duty  
And got blood on his high school ring  
[Chorus:]  
And it's hello California  
Hello Dad and Mom  
Ship ahoy  
Your baby boy  
Is home from Vietnam  
Don't you ask me any questions  
'Bout the medals on my chest  
Take the star out of the window  
And let my conscience take a rest  
Now he sailed across the ocean  
To the old far eastern war  
And it was foreign to his body  
It was foreign to his shore  
So he traded in the present  
For the better times he'd seen  
And made an oriental waitress  
His own home comin' queen  
[Chorus]

A man came to our house  
I believe it was yesterday  
I would have invited him in  
But I didn't have a lot to say  
His anticipation of me opening the door  
Outweighed my apprehension as it never had before  
And drove my concentration  
Right through that hardwood floor  
Oh, uh-huh  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm taking a walk  
I'm going outside  
I'm taking a walk  
I'm just gettin' back  
  
There's a girl in the white house  
I don't even know her name  
Her disheveled appearance  
Speaks volumes of shame  
It's an embarrassing situation  
But a situation just the same  
The way she walks on others  
And never takes the blame  
Upsets my constitution  
Beyond its motor frame  
Oh, uh-huh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Found a carton departed  
Of my worn out overalls  
From a girl in Cedar Rapids  
Now residing in Idaho Falls  
I wish you could've been there  
When she opened up the door  
And looked me in the face  
Like she never did before  
I felt about as welcome  
As a Wal-Mart superstore  
Oh, uh-huh  
  
I'm taking walk (Taking a walk)  
I'm going outside (Going outside)  
I'm taking a walk (Taking a walk)  
I don't need a ride (Just getting by)  
I'm watching the birds (Taking a walk)  
Flying so high (Going outside....)

Like a bolt of lightning, like a bolt of thunder  
Like a cloudy day, down at the zoo  
Like a drowning man that will never go under  
That close to you, yeah, that close to you  
In the middle of the night  
You'd ask me to make you smile  
You'd come on like a one armed child  
With a hole in its shoe, poor you  
Everybody oughtta know  
It only hurts you for a little while  
So stop putting yourself on trial  
For something you didn't do  
Not you, to me, can't we be just like  
Lovers and mothers and brothers and sorrow  
Can I find a little something with a nicer view  
I'm hating to plead but I'm begging to borrow  
Just to be close to you, yeah, that close to you  
In the middle of the night  
You'd ask me to make you smile  
You'd come on like a one armed child  
With a hole in its shoe, poor you  
Everybody oughtta know  
It only hurts you for a little while  
So stop putting yourself on trial  
For something you didn't do  
Not you, to me, can't we be just like  
Lovers and mothers and brothers and sorrow  
Can I find a little something with a nicer view  
I'm hating to plead but I'm begging to borrow  
Just to be that close to you, yeah, that close to you  
Ooh, that close to you, yeah, that close to you  

I know a man who's got a lot to lose  
A pretty nice fella, kinda confused  
Got muscles in his head that've never been used  
He thinks he owns half of this town  
He goes out drinkin' gets a big red nose  
Beats his old lady with a rubber hose  
Then he takes her out to dinner Buys her new clothes  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
You're up one day, the next you're down  
It's a half-an-inch of water and you think you're gonna drown  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
I was sittin' in the bathtub just countin' my toes  
When the radiator broke, water all froze  
I was stuck in the ice without my clothes  
Naked as the eyes of a clown  
I was cryin' ice cubes, hopin' I'd croak  
When the sun came through the window, the ice all broke  
I stood up and laughed, I thought it was a joke  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
You're up one day, the next you're down  
It's a half-an-inch of water and you think you're gonna drown  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
  
That's the way that the world goes 'round  
You're up one day, the next you're down  
It's a half-an-inch of water and you think you're gonna drown  
That's the way that the world goes 'round

Here's the story of a man and his family  
And a big trip that they took  
Well, I heard all about in a restaurant  
And I read it in a history book  
They rented a car at the Erie Canal  
But the car didn't have no brake  
Said ma to pa "My God this car  
Is gonna fall into the bottomless lake"  
Well, mama turned to daddy with a pale face  
Said "I've done something horribly wrong  
Well, the waters still runnin' in the bathtub  
And I think I left the kitchen light on"  
Then I heard a crash, the car when splash  
The compass rolled around and around  
Oh, for Heaven's sake! We fell in a lake  
And I think we're all gonna drown  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
There was plenty of food in the backseat  
And the windows were rolled up tight  
So we all nibbled on a chicken leg  
Told stories way through the night  
Well, pa told one that he told before  
And the baby got a bellyache  
Said ma to pa "My God this car's  
Falling down a bottomless lake"  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
Well papa played the music on the radio  
Mama rocked the baby to sleep  
He said, he would've taken the other road  
But he didn't think the lake was that deep  
Well, if the ferry had been there at the end of the pier  
We'd be half way to Uncle Jake's  
Instead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
'Stead of looking at fish out the window, I wish  
We'd hit the bottom of the bottomless lake  
We are falling down  
Down to the bottom of a hole in the ground  
Smoke 'em if you got 'em  
I'm so scared, I can hardly breathe  
I may never see my sweetheart again  
So if you're ever goin' on a big trip  
You better be careful out there  
Start everything on your good foot  
Wear clean underwear  
Take along a Bible in the backseat  
Read of David and Solomon  
For if you make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again  
If you should make a mistake in the bottomless lake  
You may never see your sweetheart again, that's right  

I come home from work this evening  
There was a note in the frying pan  
It said fix your own supper babe  
I run off with the Fuller brush man  
Chorus:  
And I miss the way she used to yell at me  
The way she used to cuss and moan  
And if I ever go out and get married again  
I'll never leave my wife at home  
Sat down at the table  
Screamed, and I hollered and cried  
And I commenced a carryin' on  
Till I almost lost my mind  
Repeat Chorus  
If I ever see another salesman  
Come a knockin' at my door  
I'm gonna pick up a rock and hit him on the head  
And knock him down on the floor  
Repeat Chorus

I knew a girl who was almost a lady  
She had a way with all the men in her life  
Every inch of her blossomed in beauty  
And she was born on the fourth of July  
Well she lived in an aluminum house trailer  
And she worked in a juke box saloon  
And she spent all the money that I give her  
Just to see the old man in the moon  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Well we'd go out on Saturday evenings  
To the drive-in on Route 41  
And it was there that I first suspected  
That she was doin' what she'd already done  
She said, "Johnny won't you get me some popcorn"  
And she knew I had to walk pretty far  
And as soon as I passed through the moonlight  
She hopped into a foreign sports car  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Well you know I could have beat up that fellow  
But it was her that had hopped into his car  
Many times I'd fought to protect her  
But this time she was goin' too far  
Now some folks they call me a coward  
'Cause I left her at the drive-in that night  
But I'd rather have names thrown at me  
Than to fight for a thing that ain't right  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  
Now she writes all the fellows love letters  
Saying "Greetings, come and see me real soon"  
And they go and line up in the barroom  
And spend the night in that sick woman's room  
But sometimes I get awful lonesome  
And I wish she was my girl instead  
But she won't let me live with her  
And she makes me live in my head  
I used to sleep at the foot of old glory  
And awake in the dawn's early light  
But much to my surprise when I opened my eyes  
I was a victim of the great compromise  

There was a time  
When lonely men would wander  
Through this land  
Rolling aimlessly along  
So many times  
I've heard of their sad story  
Written in the words  
Of dead men's songs.  
Down through the years  
Many men have yearned  
For freedom  
Some found it  
Only on the open road  
So many tears of blood  
Have fell around us  
'cause you can't always do what you are told.  
Please tell me where  
Have all the hobos gone to  
I see no fire burning down  
By the rusty railroad track  
Could it be that time  
Has gone and left them  
Tied up in life's eternal traveling sack.  
Last Sunday night  
I wrote a letter  
To my loved one  
I signed my name  
And knew I'd stayed away  
Too long  
There was a time  
When my heart was free to wander  
And I remember as I sing  
This hobo song.  

Black faces pressed against the glass  
Where rain has pressed it's weight  
Wind blown scarves in top down cars  
All share one western trait  
  
Sadness leaks through tear-stained cheeks  
From winos to dime-store Jews  
Probably don't know they give me  
These late John Garfield blues  
  
Midnight fell on Franklin Street  
And the lamppost bulbs were broke  
For the life of me, I could not see  
But I heard a brand new joke  
  
Two men were standing upon a bridge  
One jumped and screamed you lose  
And just left the odd man holding  
Those late John Garfield blues  
  
An old man sleeps with his conscience at night  
Young kids sleep with their dreams  
While the mentally ill sit perfectly still  
And live through life's in-betweens  
  
I'm going away to the last resort  
In a week or two, real soon  
Where the fish don't bite but once a night  
By the cold light of the moon  
  
The horses scream the nightmares dream  
And the dead men all wear shoes  
'Cause everybody's dancin'  
Those late John Garfield blues

The night club was burning  
From the torch singer's song  
And the sweat was floodin' her eyes  
The catwalk squeaked  
'Neath the bartender's feet  
And the smoke was too heavy to rise  
  
[Chorus:]  
She sang of the love that I left her  
And of the woman that she'll never be  
Made me feel like the buck and a quarter  
That I paid 'em to listen and see  
I paid 'em to listen and see  
I was born down in Kansas  
'Neath the October sky  
Work the day shift from seven to three  
And the only relief that I receive  
Is nearer my God to Thee  
She constantly throws me off timing  
Leaves me standing both naked and bare  
Makes me feel like the Sunday funnies  
After everything's gone off the air  
Everything's gone off the air  
I picked through the ashes  
Of the torch singer's song  
And I ordered my money a round  
For whiskey and pain  
Both taste the same  
During the time they go down  
  
[Chorus:]

Back in 1899, when everyone was singing "auld lang syne"  
A century took a long, long time for every boy and girl.  
Now there's only one thing that I'd like to know  
Where did the 20th century go?  
I'd swear it was here just a minute ago  
All over this world.  
  
Chorus:  
And now the 20th century is almost over,  
Almost over, almost over  
The 20th century is almost over  
All over this world.  
All over this world, all over this world  
The 20th century is almost over, all over this world.  
  
Does anyone remember the great depression?  
I read all about it in true confession  
I'm sorry I was late for the recording session  
But somebody put me on hold.  
Has anybody seen my linoleum floors  
Petroleum jelly, and two world wars?  
They got stuck in the revolving doors  
All over this world.  
And now...  
  
The winter's getting colder, summer's getting hotter  
Wishin' well's wishin' for another drop of water.  
And mother earth's blushin'' 'cause somebody caught her  
Makin' love to the man in the moon.  
Tell me how you gonna keep 'em down on the farm  
Now that outer space has lost it's charm?  
Somebody set off a burglar alarm  
And not a moment too soon.  
Because...  
  
Old father time has got his toes a tappin'  
Standing in the window, grumblin' and a rappin'  
Everybody's waiting for something to happen.  
Tell me if it happens to you!  
The judgment day is getting nearer  
There it is in the rear view mirror.  
If you duck down I could see a little clearer  
All over this world!  
And now...

If today the sun should set on all my hopes and cares  
There is still one smiling face the Gods would see  
But she'll walk along beside me up those golden stairs  
Oh, they'll never, ever take her love from me  
  
What a fool I was to go and break the trust she gave  
And watch her love turn into sympathy  
It's the one regret I'll carry with me to my grave  
Oh they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
I'm so thankful for each golden hour of happiness  
That we shared together in the use to be  
Someone else's arms may hold her now in fond caress  
But they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
Well, I though I'd make her happy if I'd step aside  
But I knew her love would never set me free  
And even on the morning she became another's bride  
I said they'll never, never take her love from me  
  
No, they'll never, never take her love from me

It was the third of july on a cool cloudy sky  
I set in for a storm in the makin'  
I relaxed as I sat up in our three room flat  
While my wife was in the kitchen bakin'  
Thoughts passed through my mind of no special kind  
Like faces that look like the others  
Tomorrow they say is independence day  
And I guess I'll go eat at my brother's  
  
I believe that a thought has just gotten caught  
In a place where words can't surround it  
It concerns the years past and the shadows they cast  
And my path as I walk around it.  
  
It was the third of july on a cool cloudy sky  
I set in for a storm in the makin'  
I relaxed as I sat up in our three room flat  
While my wife was in the kitchen bakin'  
Thoughts passed through my mind of no special kind  
Like faces that look like the others  
Tomorrow they say is independence day  
And I guess I'll go eat at my brother's

The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue  
Even another night of this cold war with you  
Though you won't speak and I won't speak it's true  
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through  
Oh why, oh why should love ever come  
To a couple like you and me  
Who's cold, cold wars are never done  
And hearts just can't be free  
So, let's do right  
Or let's just say we're through  
I just can't stand  
Another cold, cold war with you  
The sun goes down and leaves me sad and blue  
Even another night of this cold war with you  
Though you won't speak and I won't speak it's true  
Two stubborn people with a cold war to go through  
Oh why, oh why should love ever come  
To a couple like you and me  
Who's cold, cold wars are never done  
And hearts just can't be free  
So, let's do right  
Or let's just say we're through  
I just can't stand  
Another cold, cold war with you  

I can taste your lipstick in the wine  
I can feel your heartbeat close to mine  
With your love wrapped around me  
I'm silent and still  
I know that this love is real  
I have tasted other lips I thought were true  
I have looked into the eyes I thought were you  
Now touching just to touch  
And feeling just to feel  
I know that this love is real  
Someone should tell our dreams when love is gone  
While still in slumber memories linger one  
Sometimes I lie awake in bed till dawn  
Thinking of you  
Now you're gone  
Tender is the heart that sleeps in rest  
Tender is the hope of tenderness  
Love thy neighbor as thyself  
And thou shall not steal  
I know that this love is real  
Love thy neighbor as thyself  
And thou shall not steal  
I know that this love is real  

Darling, I can see the clouds around you  
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows  
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you  
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose  
  
Dearest love, I know your heart been shattered  
And all my words can offer no relief  
But my love will heal the pain you've suffered  
And I'll be here if you should turn to me  
  
I deepest night when memories tend to gather  
Lay with me and put your fears to sleep  
Cause there's no pain no dream can put asunder  
All the love that binds us you and me  
  
Darling, I can see the clouds around you  
And in your heart I know a sorrow grows  
But if you weep I'll be right here to hold you  
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose  
'Til each tear you cry becomes a rose

Well, I rocked over italy and I rocked over spain  
I rocked in memphis it was all the same  
Till I rocked to africa and rolled off ship.  
And seen them natives doing a odd looking skip  
I parted the weeds and looked over the swamp  
I seen them cats doing the ubangi stomp  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything that's ever been told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
Well, I looked up the chief and he invited me in  
Said a heap big jam session 'bout to begin  
He handed me a tom-tom I picked up the beat  
That crazy thing sent shivers to my feet  
Rocked and rolled and I skipped with a smile  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything that's ever been told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
Well, we rocked all night and part of the day  
Had a good rocking time with the chief's daughter mae  
I was making time and gettin' in the know  
The captain said son we gotta go.  
I said that's alright. you go on ahead  
I'm gonna ubangi stomp until I roll over dead  
Ubangi stomp with rock and roll  
Beats anything that you ever told  
Ubangi stomp ubangi style  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  
When the beat just drives a cool cat wild  

Night is falling  
We're doing the things we do  
You are acting just like me  
I'm acting just like you  
Do you remember  
When you were my friend?  
That's the way I'd like things  
Just like way back then  
  
Baby's sleeping  
Brother is on the run  
I am out undoing  
All the good I've done  
If you loved me  
Tell you what I would do  
Wrap the world in silver foil  
Bring it home to you  
  
Lately, I feel  
That I can't pretend  
I may never, ever see  
The likes of you again  
I take a walk, I come back home  
Then I sit a spell  
Watch the ponies dance around  
The empty wishing well  
  
Night has fallen  
I've said the things I did  
The only baby sleeping  
Is when I was a kid  
Do you remember  
When you were my friend?  
That's the way I'd like things  
Just like way back then

It's wedding day in Funeralville  
Your soup spoon's on your right  
The King and Queen will alternate  
With the refrigerator light  
They'll be boxing on the TV show  
The colored kids will sing  
Hoo ray for you and midnight's oil  
Let's burn the whole damn thing  
Felicia is my dark horse girl  
I'll take her if it rains  
She throws up punch upon the host  
And says many stupid things  
But she ain't so bad  
When we're all alone she's as different as can be  
She's a part a my heart, don'tcha pull us apart  
She's like one of the family  
Oh no, trouble in the attic  
Won't somebody turn on a light?  
Got so, so many troubles  
Can't even tell wrong from right  
I'm gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks, tip my hat and say goodnight  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
My car is stuck in Washington  
And I cannot find out why  
Come sit beside me on the swing  
And watch the angels cry  
It's anybody's ballgame  
It's everybody's fight  
And the street lamp said as he nodded his head  
It's lonesome out tonight  
Oh no, trouble in the attic  
Won't somebody turn on a light?  
Got so, so many troubles  
Can't even tell wrong from right  
I'm gonna comb my hair  
Darn my socks, tip my hat and say goodnight  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  
It's wedding day in Funeralville  
What shall I wear tonight?  

By a fountain back in Rome I fell in love with you  
In a small cafe in Athens You said you loved me too  
And it was April in Paris when I first held you close to me  
Rome, Georgia, Athens, Texas And Paris, Tennessee  
  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
There's no Riviera  
In Festus, Missouri  
  
And you won't find Onassis  
In Mullinville, Kansas  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love  
  
No, We're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
Our steak and martinis  
Is draft beer with weenies  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
No, we're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love  
  
No, We're not the jet set  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
The Prine and DeMent set  
Ain't the flaming suzette set  
Our Bach and Tchaikovsky  
Is Haggard and Husky  
We're the old Chevro-let set  
But ain't we got love

You've heard about the dirty dozen and the tales of the green beret  
The men that sank the bismarck and the fighting c.i. a.  
But if you're talkin' danger then one name comes to mind  
Make an unwise decisioncall the wonderful 99  
  
It was way back in the nineties a dollar still was worth a dime  
An international coincidence made newsweek and time  
A hundred brave men or women, give or take a few  
Got started on a friday nightby monday they were back in school  
  
Two kings, a pope, and the president of the denver savings and loan  
Made and unwise decision, wished they'd stayed at home  
A missile launching pad didn't go as planned  
The wonderful 99 were called to deliver it by hand  
  
99 brave soldiers in 99 pair of keds  
Lookin' for a motel 6 with 99 twin beds  
A place to park a missile an watch some cable news  
Maybe rent the top gun video and grimace like tom cruise  
  
Now there's 99 yellow ribbons around the old oak tree  
Most of it's top secret, the rest is history  
It's been a couple weeks now, how the memory fades with time  
Of an unwise decision and the wonderful 99

Is there ever enough space between us  
To keep us both honest and true?  
Why is it so hard just to sit in the yard  
And stare at the sky so blue?  
I've got a new way of walking and a new way of talking  
Honey when I'm around you,  
But it gives me the blues when I've got some good news  
And you're not there to bring it to.  
  
Life is a blessing, it's a delicatessen  
Of all the little favors you do.  
All wrapped up together no matter the weather,  
Baby you always come through.  
It's a measure of treasure that gives me the pleasure  
Of loving you the way I do  
And you know I would gladly say I need your love badly  
And bring these little things to you.  
  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
You got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Well I got some  
Gold inside me too  
  
Well I'm thinking I'm knowing that I gotta be going  
You know I hate to say so long.  
It gives me an ocean of mixed up emotion  
I'll have to work it out in a song.  
Well I'm leaving a lot for the little I got  
But you know a lot a little will do  
And if you give me your love  
I'll let it shine up above  
And light my way back home to you.  
  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Cause you got gold  
Gold inside of you  
Well I got some  
Gold inside me too  
  
You got wheels  
Turning inside of you  
You got wheels  
Turning inside of you  
Well I got wheels  
Turning inside me too

It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished 'em well  
You could see that pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle.  
And the young monsieur and madame  
Have rung the chapel bell,  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They furnished off an apartment  
With a two room roebuck sale  
The coolerator was filled  
With t.v. dinners and ginger ale  
But when pierre found work,  
The little money comin' worked out well  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They had a hi-fi phono  
Boy, did they let it blast  
Seven hundred little records  
All rock, rhythm and jazz  
But when the sun went down  
The rapid tempo of the music fell  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
They bought a souped up jitney  
'twas a cherry in fifty-three  
They drove it down to new orleans  
To celebrate their anniversary.  
It was there where pierre was wedded  
To the lovely mademoiselle,  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  
It was a teenage wedding  
And the old folks wished 'em well  
You could see that pierre  
Did truly love the mademoiselle.  
And the young monsieur and madame  
Have rung the chapel bell,  
"see'est la vie,"  
-say the old folks  
It goes to show that you never can tell  

[spoken] This is a song I wrote with John Prine 4 years ago (1972) and we
tried to put into one song, everything that had ever been in any of the
country and western songs we had ever heard. Tried to put it all into one
song. Serves us right. This is what came out:  
  
Well it was all I could do to keep from cryin'  
Some times it seems so useless to remain  
You're the one who always tried to change me  
And that is why I will always stay the same  
  
Chorus:  
But I'll hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by my name  
  
No, you don't have to call me Freddy Fender  
You don't have to call me Charlie Pride  
You don't have to call me Merle Haggard anymore  
Even though you know you're on my fighting side  
  
Chorus- this verse only:  
And I'm gonna hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain (when nights are cold and lonely)  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by name.  
  
[musical by mouth improv done in a Merle Haggard-like tone -no words]  
  
[spoken] I've seen my name, a few times in the phone book  
[spoken] And on the neon sign above the bar I used to own  
[spoken] And there's only one thing I'm really sure of was that sucker  
You're gonna hear it when my savior calls me home  
  
[spoken] That's a lot to get into one song. We left out all the good stuff.
Dallas, dope, divorce, dead dogs, trains prison Christmas, mothers, farms, and
trucks. Mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms, Christmas, and dead dogs are
essential, you can't have a good country song without them things. And with
all due respect this song needs mothers, prison, trucks, trains, farms,
Christmas and dead dogs and is that it? Whatever it is - it's also 4 minutes
long already (they're going 'when's he gonna end, when's he gonna end in the
booth back there') So I'll just tack this verse on the end here-  
  
Ever since the dog died and mama went to prison  
Ain't nothin' round this old farm that's been the same  
[Spoken] You know when mom broke out last Christmas  
She drove the getaway laundry truck into a train  
  
Chorus:  
But I'll hang around as long as you will let me  
I never minded standing in the rain  
You don't have to call me darlin', darlin'  
But you never even call me by my name

While digesting Reader's Digest in the back of a dirty book store  
A plastic flag, with gum on the back fell out on the floor  
Well, I picked it up and I ran outside, slapped it on my window shield  
And if I could see old Betsy Ross I'd tell her how good I feel  
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for  
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
Well, I went to the bank this morning and the cashier he said to me  
"If you join the Christmas club we'll give you ten of them flags for free"  
Well, I didn't mess around a bit, I took him up on what he said  
And I stuck them stickers all over my car and one on my wife's forehead  
But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
They're already overcrowded from your dirty little war  
Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for  
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
Well, I got my window shield so filled with flags I couldn't see  
So, I ran the car upside a curb and right into a tree  
By the time they got a doctor down I was already dead  
And I'll never understand why the man standing in the pearly gates said  
"But your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore  
We're already overcrowded from your dirty little war"  
"Now Jesus don't like killin', no matter what the reason's for  
And your flag decal won't get you into Heaven anymore"
