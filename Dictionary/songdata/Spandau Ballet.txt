Ooh, you're always in the back of my mind, ooh  
Nothing ever changes, oh, I wish to God it did  
Just another drink and you'll be gone  
Oh, it's two am raining again  
I saw you making faces in the river  
Only me, down by the quay  
Just a sad reflection that I give you  
I thought time would burn it  
Burn it down to the ground  
Just another breeze and you'll be strong  
Oh, I'm driving home, all on my own  
Just a passenger in all that we lost  
Satisfy, oh, Lord, don't deny  
I see your face in the everything that's near 'cause  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, I have all the memories, the winter of eighty-two  
When down upon the ice you saw me melt  
Oh, it's two am raining again  
I saw you making faces in the river  
Only me, down by the quay  
Just a sad reflection that I give you  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, washed up on the rocks again  
Oh, don't you know that it's so damn hot  
And the things you do?  
I won't ever learn, ooh, I won't ever learn  
Oh, washed up on the rocks again  
Oh, don't you know that it's so damn hot  
And the things you do?  
I won't ever learn, I won't ever learn  
Ooh, I won't ever learn, I won't ever learn  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
Ooh, you were always in the back of my mind  
In the back of mind  
You're in the back of mind  
In the back of mind  

Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Two young babes in a foreign land  
Draw no milk from the dusty sand  
Close heir eyes from the night so cold  
Feel the love in their mothers hold  
Two old men on their different shores  
Stretch the world with their tug of war  
Tension pulls on a tightening cord  
Spread your love over Mans discord  
Life's your reward  
So sing it to your Lord  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Science stands on threshold of life  
Man could be cut by a blow of its knife  
Time to live by a new resolution  
In the spirit of loves evolution  
Two young girls shining in the sun  
Feel your pain but they dance for everyone  
Beauty lives in their innocent glow  
Things so dear should be free to let grow  
So let your heart flow  
And sing it to your soul  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Now baby, be free wih your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Now baby, be free wih your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love  
Be free with your love  
Free with your love

Big feeling  
Come next September I'll be out upon the road again  
And there'll be times when I can hardly even say your name  
But now we're sticking to the sheets and I can't sleep tonight  
And like a dream love we're moving into light  
Oh, I feel like this is warning  
And oh I feel like ten feet tall  
And don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh it's getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
Oh come on, darling now day has turned it's time for home  
I won't forget that night we slept out on the beach alone  
Now the sun has come to take the moon and light the sky  
Wave over me flow over me  
Oh, I feel like this is warning  
And oh I feel like ten feet tall  
And don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh, it's getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
(Lighting here inside)  
Feeling inside  
Don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Don't ever let me down  
Big feeling  
Oh, it's getting hard to hide  
Big feeling  
Like a river running wide  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
Big feeling  
Oh come on darling, now day has turned it's time for home  
Big feeling  
I won't forget that night we slept out on the beach alone  
You are my thunder  
And there's lighting here inside  
Lighting here inside  

Matthew didn't stay home, he went abroad instead  
Journeys to glory breathing in his head  
Got caught up with shoe horns but he couldn't get a shine  
Matthew bought the rap and read the map without a sign  
Contort yourself on disco  
With a rap trap white and brown  
Caught within the spinning  
The key chain gang went down  
No coffee club will have the rub  
When product is your answer  
Discuss the man, he'll break your plan  
It's deep within the dancer  
Wear it on your back now and summarize your vision on the train  
And through the strain, your own soul decision  
Well, she had a certain shimmer, she sleeps with him tonight  
Stifled love decides where I'm dreaming  
No coffee club will have the rub  
When product is your answer  
Discuss the man, he'll break your plan  
It's deep within the dancer  

Communication always leaves me in incomplete  
The grass is greener, but it's grown beneath my feet  
Love inspiration is a message on a wing  
But I have left it in the words you'll never sing  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here, I'm left here  
Telex or tell me but it's always second-hand  
I'm incognito but no rendezvous been planned  
Dictate or relate I could send it to your home  
"Return to sender" I could sing it down the phone  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I  
Dictate, relate  
Dictate, relate  
I'm sitting and waiting by the telephone  
Waiting for the bell to ring  
Short change fumble, 'Dial a heart' trouble  
And I ain't got time for searching through the rubble, oh no  
Well no  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here  
Communication let me down  
And I'm left here, I'm left here, I, I, I  
I'm left here  
I'm left here  
I'm left here  
...  

We have no way to see eye to eye  
Through all the walls in their mind  
These are the pleasures that terrify  
So leave them behind  
You keep the chains that are in your life  
We'll take flight of the dove  
There's only one way to satisfy  
This feeling that's love  
And I'll say it again, and I'll say it again  
And if the power comes between us  
Oh, I'll know what to do,  
I'm gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight,  
Take this chance and show your might,  
All the world's on the other side,  
Cross the line  
Raise a flag to a moral crime,  
We'll light a fire for this,  
Make the papers by morning time  
And lay in our bliss  
So come on darling and share my mind,  
There is no need to stay hid  
'cause all we are now is two of a kind  
Can you believe what we did?  
And I'll say it again, oh, and I'll say it again  
That when the power comes between us  
Oh, I'll know what to do,  
I'm gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight  
Take this chance and show your might  
All world's on the other side  
Cross the line  
Mother come to me now,  
Take this hand now, I'm afraid  
Mother, come to me  
I'm bleeding  
We had no way to see eye to eye  
Through all the walls in their mind  
These were the pleasures that terrified  
We left them behind  
And I'll say it again, and I'll say it again  
And if the power comes between us  
Oh, I'll know what to do,  
I'm gonna say it to you  
Cross the line tonight,  
Take this chance and show your might,  
All the world's on the other side,  
Cross the line  

Once there were times, love when we could touch the air between  
And out across this room we'd fill the space with all our skins  
And if we just touch hands, life would shine with electric dreams  
No matter how many miles, nothing hurt long distance hearts  
And there was always something there that space could never keep apart  
But now I know inside that something's died  
When we're apart, all we have are empty spaces  
It's not like we're building walls, too hard to climb to make us blind  
It's just so much numbing space to hollow out the heart and mind  
And I can hear echoes of ghosts of love, we left behind  
I'll always love April, we fell in love and we planted seeds  
And now we walk through fallen trees and leaves are crushed beneath  
And I will always live in autumn  
Now we're agreed, all we have are empty spaces  
I thought this was meant to be our love had an energy  
But only as time evolved and all of our strength dissolved  
And we'll never feel the flame that burned so naked again  
I walk through Kentish Town and all the rain, rain pouring down  
So many people here but space like this I've never found  
And as I get back home and step inside  
I realize, all I have, all I have are empty spaces  

Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
So many people, so many problems  
There in the pretty city lights  
Where we've thrown it all away  
Well, if life is here before my eyes  
Then I find it hard to see  
How the methods that we're told to use  
Are gonna make us free  
Until then I say  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
All through the mystery,  
All through the heartache  
She's got the only single thing  
That I'll never throw away  
Oh, if lightning strikes for a second time  
Will you come and pull me through?  
It's a battle that we all must make,  
So show me what to do  
And you said  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Well there's a feeling growing that is in this land,  
There's a soul that's burning and it's your hand  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
fight for ourselves  
  
Fight...Fight  
  
Oh so many people now, there's so many problems  
There in the pretty city lights  
Where we've thrown it all away  
Well, if life is here before my eyes  
Then I find it hard to see  
How the methods that we're told to use  
Are gonna make us free  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Well there's a feeling growing that is in this land,  
There's a soul that's burning and it's your hand  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Fight for ourselves  
Fight for ourselves  
We gotta fight for ourselves  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
  
Fight Fight  
  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves  
Everybody, we've got to fight for ourselves

Hello, this is me to you  
It's better now we're comin' through  
And I don't really know just who we are  
I'll stay here till my love's full up  
So stir this cocktail, shake me up  
Drink me down and take me from the bar  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
You know we got to build, build it up  
Spent the night in Tumbledown  
A hundred miles from west of town  
Plans were laid, no compromise was made  
Gently up to meet the blue  
Left a note and signed it "True"  
Those construction games were all we played  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Yeah we're gonna build, build it up  
Oh, I know you're gonna give your best  
So more or less, gotta put it to the test  
Don't you know, you've got the whole world in your hands  
Surrender up and lay down your arms  
The fightin' hurts but the lovin' calms  
Oh, I know you've got the whole world in your hands  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
Build a foundation  
You know we got to build, build it up  
We'll build a foundation  
Build a foundation, build it up  
Build a foundation, build it up  
You know we got to build  
...  

Glow, take out this foreign heart  
Wash off the sand that seeps out through my eyes  
I've still sleep in my eyes  
Cold, cold's how we felt so long  
Accuse me of crying and speaking of lies  
I've still sleep in my eyes, I've still sleep in my eyes  
Glow like a lover  
Out, out is the winter pale  
Gold rising June in the blue of my eye  
I've still sleep in my eyes  
Glow, this is my family  
Send for the soul you can soon realize  
I've still sleep in my eyes, I've still sleep in my eyes  
Glow like a lover  
Glow, take out this foreign heart  
Wash off the sand that seeps out through my eyes  
I've still sleep in my eyes  
Cold, cold's how we felt so long  
Accuse me of crying and speaking of lies  
I've still sleep in my eyes, I've still sleep in my eyes  
Glow like a lover  

Thank you for coming home  
I'm sorry that the chairs are all worn  
I left them here I could have sworn  
These are my salad days  
Slowly being eaten away  
Just another play for today  
Oh, but I'm proud of you, but I'm proud of you  
Nothing left to make me feel small  
Luck has left me standing so tall  
  
[Chorus:]  
Gold (gold)  
Always believe in your soul  
You've got the power to know  
You're indestructible  
Always believe in, that you are  
Gold (gold)  
Glad that you're bound to return  
There's something I could have learned  
You're indestructible, always believe in...  
  
After the rush has gone  
I hope you find a little more time  
Remember we were partners in crime  
It's only two years ago  
The man with the suit and the face  
You knew that he was there on the case  
Now he's in love with you, he's in love with you  
And love is like a high prison wall  
But you could leave me standing so tall  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And love is like a high prison wall  
But you could leave me standing so tall  
  
Gold (gold)  
Always believe in your soul  
You've got the power to know  
You're indestructible  
Always believe in, 'cause you are  
Gold (gold)  
I'm glad that you're bound to return  
Something I could have learned  
You're indestructible, always believe in...  
(Gold)

Your pressed your face against my heart  
I felt that you could look right through me  
We live in days that have no time  
We live in times that now refuse me  
And somewhere out beyond his town  
There lies a world that now can turn us round  
And we need it and we need it  
Oh, got to have some thing to believe in  
I've got enough to believe in you  
What can I give just to know that it's true?  
But I've gotta begin to say  
Now they've taken my pride in this way  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust?  
I feel to thin before your eyes  
I feel so naked under open skies  
I once stood tall within this town  
But now the time has come to bring us down  
We must have more with his power in hand  
We must believe things will go as we planned  
But I've gotta begin to say  
Now they've taken my pride in this way  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust, with a handful of dust ?  
Making love through electric skies  
Now I know where my fortune lies  
Breathe the air and feel this land  
'Cause it's slipping through me like dust from my hand  
How can you give me your love?  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust?  
(How can you give me your love?)  
I just can't give you enough  
How can you give me your trust, ooh hoo  
With a handful of dust?  
(How can you give me your love?)  
How can you give me your love?  
Now give me your love  
(How can you give me your trust)  
Ooh hoo, hey, with a handful of dust?  
(How can you give me your love?)  
Give me  
(How can you give me your trust)  

She'll sing a West-Side song  
You could be the boy in the film  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Where are the West-Side boys?  
Fighting on the scaffold of love  
Scripted pleasures made forever  
Easier said than done together  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Here is her model home  
Listen to the call of the wild  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Facts are an awful shame  
The shadow of a doubtful affair  
Scripted pleasures made forever  
Easier said than done together  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Act One's the same as you read in the book  
Could this be the thing that they shout about?  
No more in distress, now it's rushed through the door  
And you can't believe that the secrets out  
Scripted pleasures made forever  
Easier said than done together  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
It's a passion  
It's a long way over there  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Far from her arms tonight  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  
Heaven is a secret  

This is the song of little Jo  
She's not the girl I used to know  
Forever screaming all the day and night  
She used to be a diplomat  
But now she's down the laundromat  
They washed her mind and now she finds it hard  
I know her name  
But now she never seems the same  
She don't talk to me  
'Cause she can't take no sympathy  
Because she's highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
She's stepping out upon the ledge  
She's got a gun against her head  
She's wired up to blow the power line  
She's walking out upon the knife  
She'll take you to the edge of life  
Just like the song, the pressure is on again  
I know her name  
Ho, but now she never seems the same  
She don't talk to me  
'Cause she can't take no sympathy  
Because she's highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
No, no, no  
I know her name  
Ho, but now she never seems the same  
She don't talk to me  
'Cause she can't take no sympathy  
Because she's highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
Highly strung  
Oh, highly strung, she's undone  
This is the song of little Jo  
She's not the girl I used to know  

Passion take the wind  
And break me from this tie  
We're mortals on the earth  
Oh but God's in the sky  
I haven't got a clue  
I haven't got a thing  
But what I give to you  
Is all that I could bring  
I'll give you all my time  
That's everything to me  
You know my only crime  
Is this flight of fantasy  
  
Because I've nothing else here for you  
And just because it's easier than the truth  
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do  
I'll fly for you  
  
Passion take the wind  
And break me from this tie  
We're mortals on the earth  
Oh but God's in the sky  
I haven't got a clue  
I haven't got a thing  
But what I give to you  
Is all that I could bring  
I'll give you all my time  
That's everything to me  
You know my only crime  
Is this flight of fantasy  
  
Because I've nothing else here for you  
And just because it's easier than the truth  
Oh if there's nothing else that I can do  
I'll fly for you  
  
I'm just an average boy  
You're more than an average girland  
When you sing to me the 'sho be doos'  
You sing so well  
Oh don't you know that when I'm under you  
I'm overjoyed

Cheap bed, in the red  
Sleep the words out of your head  
Cold floor, nice and raw  
Eat the meat that's on the floor  
High tide, some disguise  
Loving makes the cream taste nice  
New shore, final score  
On fresh demand, I'm wanting more  
This might not last too long  
So always take it  
This might not last too long  
So take it  
Reasons, reasons were here from the start  
It?s my instinction, it's my instinction  
Reasons, reasons were part of the art  
It?s my instinction, it?s my instinction  
You cry, justify  
But deep beneath the feelings lie  
Photo, looking old  
Memory makes the day feel cold  
they've gone, sing your song  
Walk the flow, ah, too slow  
Post boom, second doom  
Stealing cake to eat the moon  
This might not last too long  
So always take it  
This might not last too long  
So take it  
Reasons, reasons were here from the start  
It?s my instinction, it's my instinction  
Reasons, reasons were part of the art  
It?s my instinction, it?s my instinction  
It?s my instinction, hey  
Cheap bed, in the red  
You cry, justify  
Post boom, second doom  
Stealing cake to eat the moon  
Reasons, reasons were here from the start  
It?s my instinction, it's my instinction  
Reasons, reasons were part of the art  
It?s my instinction, it?s my instinction  
It?s my instinction, ohh  
Stealing cake to eat the moon  

Changing her colours she's off to the shore  
She rides the soul train and he fight the law  
There's a power in his voice and it makes her feel so sure  
So live and live in love  
One day he'll build a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
This subterfuge he never really planned  
Now you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing  
So live and let live in love  
Exchanging their letters their exits begun  
With deathless precision he's aiming his gun  
A democracy of sorts that justifies the sun  
So live and let live in love  
Neither has the ghost of a chance  
Those decisions only can be made once  
You never really know just what you're giving  
Till you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing  
He could have built a statue with his hands  
So gentle when he tries to understand  
You never really know just what you're giving  
Till you're living in the lifeline  
We're moving  
In the lifeline  
We're walking  
In the lifeline  
We're throwing to you  
But I'm not living

I've only myself to blame,  
Now that I'm tangled up in chains,  
So you say, ooh, so you say  
Caught in this human cage,  
Trapped, and I'm fired up with rage  
And somebody's got to pay  
I can never talk about it,  
I can never say what I want to say  
So I'll take your tip and I'll bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
You say I'm a man of straw  
Well, baby, I'm gonna break your law  
Then it's war, ooh, yes it's war  
Love on a thin white line,  
Love that was just a waste of time,  
Oh, not anymore  
I can feel it coming at me,  
I can feel it coming like the wind  
But, I'm locked away and I'm bound to stay,  
So no one can get in  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains  
There must be a reason why  
You're pulling the wool down on my eyes  
It's a lie, it's a lie  
Dragging this ball and chain,  
Oh, how long can I take this pain?  
But somebody has to try, yeah  
Oh, I can feel the pressure on me,  
I can feel it taking me from the start  
Sticks and stones will smash my bones,  
But never break my heart  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains  
I can never talk about it,  
Oh, I can never say what I want to say  
So I'll take your tip and I'll bite my lip  
And hope it goes away  
I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
Oh, I'm a man in chains, I'm a man in chains  
I only pray that before I die,  
Just like a phoenix I will rise and fly  
Tell me who's to blame,  
Oh, I'm a man, now I'm a man in chains  

Oh, mandolin, oh, mandolin  
Waiting in the dark  
All centuries passed down upon  
Your smooth Venetian skin  
Memories, oh, memories  
Lay stains upon your heart  
When lovers dance into the trance  
You weaved by candlelight  
Oh, I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played I cried for more  
Oh, mandolin, oh, mandolin  
Waiting in the dark  
Well, centuries passed down upon  
Your smooth Venetian skin  
Incessant sound, incessant sound  
That stirs the young and pure  
Incestuous I kiss my hand  
And play the calling drum  
The lover cried into the silk  
Many years ago  
Your voice laid comfort down upon  
His European skin  
Oh, I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played I cried for more  
Oh, I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played I cried for more  
Oh, I saw a sunrise like never before  
As mandolin played, oh, I cried for more  
Mandolin, oh, mandolin  
Waiting in the dark  
Oh, centuries passed down upon  
Your smooth Venetian skin  

The bells ring out above my room  
And announcement of our loss  
And in the act, three men decide  
An indefinite epilogue  
My letters have all gone  
A journey that's unsure  
A message that was rich  
A hand that was poor  
Oh, have me, breath and let me go  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
Oh, I don't want you, want you, want you  
My own description may have failed  
Torn from pictures that were saved  
Along with images from words  
That were saved and not erased  
The shelves arranged above my head  
A memory of my fears  
Blankets hold the smell of life  
And soak the many years  
Oh, have me, breath and let me go  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
?Cause I don't want you to know  
Oh, I don't want you, want you, want you  
Oh, missionary are you here  
Sun doesn't burn when the water comes  
But water doesn't come like the English rain  
They bury their heads for self defense  
A marked improvement through diligence  
We are alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Vacant rooms that are full of men  
That sit on the stools awaiting time  
Discussion leads to little sense  
They bury their heads for self defense  
We are alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  
Alone against our sins  

I can make you feel so good  
Hold me by the arm  
I can take your speckles of sweetness  
And turn them into stars  
I can make your dreams so real  
Just think what we could do  
Oh I could be your messiah  
And I'll take you higher  
And maybe I won't stop till I do  
'cause I'm your motivator  
I'm behind everything you do  
Yes I'm your motivator  
If your heart is thumping  
I can give you something  
Feel me with the crack of my whip.  
I will be your inspiration  
Movin' in your soul  
I'll be your little bit of muscle  
And move and take control  
I can be just simple persuasion  
So take me as your guide  
But when your mind is cooking  
Remember who's looking  
'cause baby I'm that something inside  
'cause I'm your motivator  
I'm behind everything you do  
Yes I'm your motivator  
If your head is reeling  
Get off on this feeling  
Hold me now and shoot from the hip.  
Do do do  
You give something something I need.  

We're building fires that will burn until morning  
The smell of books and hot stone surrounds us  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we make  
We feel the steam as it rises around us  
Up from the soil that is cracking its back  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we sing  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
We're building fires that will burn until morning  
The smell of books and hot stone surrounds us  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we make  
To feel the pulsing from chanter to mountain  
Down through the vein and into the grain  
Strong is the shoulder that moves to the time  
Here is the land it can break  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Tough is the leather that's strapped to my skin  
Strong are the bonds that we sing  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Gotta work till you're musclebound, all night long  
Work till you're musclebound, all night long  

It is the key to all the doors  
It is the crashing on the shores  
It lives in your steering wheel  
It hides in the wind and rain  
With voices as cold as steel  
It's calling your name  
It is the smile upon his face  
It is the winning of the race  
It lives in the red-alert  
It lives in the power game  
It's easy to take to heart  
But harder to tame  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
It is the glowing in his eyes  
It is the reason for his lies  
Oh, how many know you're there  
Oh, how many play your game  
He's always the man to dare  
You're always to blame  
It is the need to understand  
Oh, it is the trigger in his hand  
It lives in the uniform  
It grows from the need to gain  
With faces so old and torn  
It's calling your name  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
It lives in the red-alert  
It lives in the power game  
It's easy to take to heart  
But harder to tame  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
Without all this heat  
They'll be dancing west to east  
This is the nature of the beast  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  
This is the nature of the beast  
(This is the nature)  

Layin' in the after glow  
I only want to learn what you know  
But now you're leavin'  
How many hearts must you break  
And how many calls must I make  
  
But now you're leavin'  
In this world all that I choose has come unbearable  
But love is in your touch  
Ooh, it's killing me so much  
  
Chorus:  
  
Oh only when you leave  
I'll need to love you  
And when the action has all gone  
I'm just a little fool enough to need you  
A fool enough too long  
Only when you leave, you'll leave in danger  
Ooh, I'll make sure that you pay  
So give a little passion to a stranger  
And take this soul away  
  
I only want to make this things last  
So how could this have gone so fast  
And now you're leavin'  
How many times must I learn  
It's only when you've gone that I burn  
  
And now you're leavin'  
In the end, all that is left has come unbearable  
It's hard to change your mind  
So leave it all behind  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Layin' in the after glow  
I only want to learn what you know  
Ooh, but now you're leavin'  
How many hearts must you break  
And how many calls must I make  
  
But now you're leavin'  
In this world all that I choose has come unbearable  
But love is in your touch  
Ooh, it's killing me so much  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Woo-oh-oh-oh...no no no no  
  
Only when you leave, you'll leave in danger  
Ooh, I'll make sure that you pay  
So give a little passion to a stranger...

Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
Going alone, going alone, going alone  
Take that pharaoh  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
When the lights die down  
You'll see them go  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping  
Please don't let my memory fail me now  
'Cause I've waited all this time and I can't run another mile  
(Another mile)  
Oh, please don't let the world know now  
Please don't let the world know now  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping  
We are all living for the game, for the game  
Oh, heaven is weeping  

Pleasure's in my car  
Even in the bar as I'm searching  
In the love that's strong  
Breathing in the song, I'm learning  
(I am learning)  
Pleasure in the sand  
Warm within the hand she's holding  
It is on the screen  
Adventures at nineteen, I'm searching  
I am searching in my heart  
Pleasure in my heart  
Never let us part for pleasure  
Work,work today  
Never let them pay for pleasure  
Leave or lose her from my heart  
Pleasure is your name  
I accept he blame for falling  
It is down the phone  
Living in your home, I'm calling  
(I am calling)  
Pleasure is a word  
When love is left unheard,it's burning  
It is on the screen  
Adventures at nineteen, I'm searching  
I am searching in my heart.  
Why do you feel like breaking my heart?  
What made you feel like breaking my heart tonight?  
Now I am crying,now I am crying  
Pleasure in my heart  
Never let us part for pleasure  
Work,work today  
Never let them pay for pleasure  
Leave or lose her from my heart

Bleak and tired western skies  
Silence crashing with quiet lies  
Shattered glass reflects elation  
Reformation, reformation  
I saw you running through my dreams  
Question held me to the scene  
Your face was wet with perspiration  
Reformation, reformation  
there's something wrong, there's something wrong  
Man is something that must be overcome  
Quick, snap, break, crack, complication  
Reformation, reformation  
I saw you running through my dreams  
A sun burst through a cloudy scene  
Shattered glass reflects elation  
Reformation, reformation  
Bleak and tired western skies  
Silence crashing with quiet lies  
Shattered glass reflects elation  
Reformation, reformation  

Don't I need a savior  
Just to bail me out  
I'll hold my breath  
Until the water lets me out  
And I say  
Alimony never can pay  
Hey, hey, hey  
I'm on the breadline  
Your on the answer phone  
You're off the hook  
And I'm left all alone  
It's a shame  
Passion isn't always to blame  
Hey, hey, hey  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
I'm undercover  
My love has overgrown  
Retaliation is emotion  
I have shown  
And I say  
All the money never can pay  
Hey, hey, hey  
I'm on the level  
You're on the second floor  
I'm counting seconds  
As my hand goes for the door  
It's a shame  
Pleasure isn't always the same  
Hey, hey, hey  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
I need revenge for love, revenge for love  
Revenge for love, revenge for love  
Don't I need a savior  
Just to bail me out  
I'll hold my breath  
Until the water lets me out  
And I say  
Alimony never can pay  
Hey, hey, hey  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  
Oh, I needed, I needed, I needed  
Revenge for love  
Sweet revenge for love  
Oh, I don't need time  
Just sweet revenge for love  
(Don't say, don't say, don't say)  
It's a crime  
Just give me sweet revenge  

I don't have to be so wise  
You're just my fantasy  
And I will fantasize  
Something more or less to make this things started  
We're the artisans  
And we've been crafted  
I want to be your magical mystery  
I want to be your final history  
This is the news  
Nothing's ever been so wild  
All that I get to do  
Is what I give to you  
This is all about the circles we've found  
And through the ups and downs  
It goes round  
Oh I was just beginning to grow strong  
She was only eighteen summers long  
We were the news  
Round and round it goes  
And oh don't you know  
This is the game that we came here for  
Round and round it goes,  
And don't you know  
This is the news of my life  
Oh I was just beginning to grow strong  
She was only eighteen summers long  
We were the news  
Round and round it goes  
And oh don't you know  
This is the game that we came here for  
Round and round it goes,  
And don't you know

We are the night  
We'll tempt you and turn you on  
Live in our hearts  
And play with your man  
Oh, these are your toys  
Hold them and they'll obey  
Blood into life  
They still become your toys  
This is your game  
In heaven in your bedroom  
Chivalrous knight  
Will save you tonight  
They'll look for reasons again and again  
Let them go, let them go, let them go  
You'll have your reason again and again  
For letting them go, for letting them go  
We are the night  
We'll tempt you and turn you on  
Live in our hearts  
And play with your man  
They'll look for reasons again and again  
Let them go, let them go, let them go  
You'll have your reasons again and again  
For letting them go, for letting them go  
Oh, stand by the wall  
Watch as they shoot you down  
Blood onto stone  
They're still your toys  
Your toys, your toys  

Huh huh huh hu-uh huh  
  
So true funny how it seems  
Always in time, but never in line for dreams.  
Head over heels when toe to toe.  
This is the sound of my soul,  
This is the sound.  
I bought a ticket to the world,  
But now I've come back again.  
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?  
Oh I want the truth to be said.  
  
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh  
I know this much is true.  
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh  
I know this much is true.  
  
With a thrill in my head and a pill on my tongue  
Dissolve the nerves that have just begun.  
Listening to Marvin (all night long.)  
This is the sound of my soul,  
This is the sound.  
Always slipping from my hands,  
Sand's a time of its own.  
Take your seaside arms and write the next line.  
Oh I want the truth to be known.  
  
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh  
I know this much is true.  
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh  
I know this much is true.  
  
I bought a ticket to the world,  
But now I've come back again.  
Why do I find it hard to write the next line?  
Oh I want the truth to be said.  
  
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh  
I know this much is true.  
Huh huh huh hu-uh huh  
I know this much is true.  
  
This much is true.  
  
I know, I know, I know this much is true.

There's gotta be something more to this life we're given  
Gotta be peace o' mind and a piece o' living  
When the losers have won and the damage is done  
Only then will you be saved  
She dancing on thin ice while her mind is skating  
He's building on the dust that is suffocating  
And a baby that cries in a city of lies  
For a freedom that is craved  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Sunny had a street that she couldn't live in  
Sunny had a room that she couldn't breath in  
But a heart that could feel and a hand that could heal  
And a passion filled with rage  
I never felt the air with a wind of change  
I only felt a storm with a wind and rain  
A city so deep, a soul without sleep  
And a heart that's filled with pain  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Look out on a million dreams  
There's fire in all those schemes  
I feel the burn of investigation  
Love will be your inspiration  
Baby, lets go again  
On me and you it all depends  
The power of love is a powerful friend  
And I will love you till the end  
High will you fly tonight  
In dreams you can hold this tight  
But when will love blow round  
When will love blow around  
When will love blow all through Windy Town  
Baby, through Windy Town
