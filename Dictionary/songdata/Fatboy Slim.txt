Body movin', body movin'  
A1 sound, sound so soothin'  
Body movin', body movin'  
We be gettin' down and you know we're crush groovin'  
  
Let me get some action from the back section  
We need body rockin', not perfection  
Let your backbone flip but don't slip a disc  
Let your spine unwind just take a risk  
I wanna do the freak until the break of dawn  
Tell me party people is that so wrong?  
The ship is dockin', interlockin'  
And up-rockin', electro-shockin'  
We're getting down, computer action  
Do the robotic satisfaction  
All of ya'll get off the wall  
Have a ball and get involved with  
  
Body movin', body movin'  
With the A1 sound, sound so soothin'  
Body movin', body movin'  
We be gettin' down and you know we're crush groovin'  
  
Flame on, I'm gone  
I'm so sweet like a nice bon bon  
Came out rappin' when I was born  
Mom said, "Rock it 'til the break of dawn"  
Puttin' bodies in motion 'cause I got the notion  
Like Roy Cormier with the coconut lotion  
  
The sound of the music drivin' you insane  
You can't explain to people this type of mind frame  
Like a bottle of Chateau Neuf de Pap[sic]  
I'm fine like wine when I start to rap  
We need body rockin' not perfection  
Let me get some action from the back section  
  
Body movin', body movin'  
A1 sound, sound so soothin'  
Body movin', body movin'  
We be gettin' down and you know we're crush groovin'  
  
Mike D with the master plan  
Ooh my my and thank you ma'am  
And when I grab the mic you scream "ooh goddamn!"  
The creme de la creme is who I am  
Mca where have you been?  
Packed like sardines in the tin  
So kick off your shoes and put on your swim fins  
'Cause when it comes to quarries I'm known to swim  
Adrock light up the place  
And if you pull my card you pull the ace  
And if you ask me, turn up the bass  
And if you play Defender I could be your hyperspace  
  
Body movin', body movin'  
A1 sound, sound so soothin'  
Body movin', body movin'  
We be gettin' down and you know we're crush groovin'

When it comes to affairs of the head,  
I usually find that the better hung are the well read.  
See that sat beneath the tree of thought,  
Well five'll get you ten that it's me.  
If ignorance is paradise, I don't agree.  
  
Every minute I try,  
To change my mind.  
Every minute I try,  
To change my mind.  
  
When it comes to affairs of the leg,  
Don't try to purchase life's tapestry off the peg.  
You might be sitting all alone in your room,  
Flying in an armchair ride.  
I think you'll find when you're looking out,  
You'll see inside.  
  
Something in this world has changed my mind I find,  
I took a trip to heaven on the wings of mankind.  
Something in this world makes every sense, experience,  
Take me to Utopia, to hell with the expense  
  
When it comes to affairs of the mouth,  
Come sup the sociable seminar in the deep south.  
Don't tell me that talk is cheap,  
When it's clear as my nose that it's not.  
We make up all the characters, but not the plot

They say she had a heart attack  
I think the preacher's coming back  
And I'm frying 'cause all my love's electrifying  
  
And I'm comfy like a cesspool  
want to be with you  
And it's my premonition  
I better give my heart a listen  
And my preacher say  
  
All of your demons will wither away  
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay  
You'll understand when you come my way  
'Cause all of my demons have withered away  
  
They said he shook himself to death  
I want to dance 'til my last breath  
But mister disco only parties hard in Frisco  
  
And I'm comfy like a cesspool  
want to be with you  
And it's my premonition  
I better give my heart a listen  
And my preacher say  
  
All of your demons will wither away  
Ecstasy comes and they cannot stay  
You'll understand when you come my way  
'Cause all of my demons have withered away

My eyes that cannot see  
Other guys that are cuter  
And my ears that cannot hear  
My friends say I should walk away  
  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you  
  
My knees that all go weak that all go kiddiup  
When you don't call me and my head  
It thousand spend so don't tell me  
Without your sweet happen  
  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you  
  
My mind is buggin' out when I think you're in  
Seem it wrong like I expect  
And my toes watch them curl  
So don't call me, babe, 'cause I'm your little girl  
  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you

My mind is buggin out when I think you're in

It won't do without you  
Without my heart, it won't do, babe  
It just won't do without you

When he told me that I ought to come back home,  
I tried.  
And when he told me that he was tired of being  
alone,  
I cried.  
Now all these years have passed,  
The music has always held my hand.  
We'll ride the back up train forever,  
With this saint-like man.  
  
He was the only one that I'd ever listen to,  
He was the only one.  
  
Now when my life's in doubt,  
There's always a reason to belong.  
And when my wife was gone,  
His music always made me strong.  
If there's a heaven where good music goes,  
I know it will be there.  
We know he loves, we know he sings, we know he  
tries,  
He cares

I like to dream  
Right between the sound machine  
On a cloud of sound I drift in the night  
Any place it goes is right  
Goes far, flies near, to the stars away from here  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?  
You don't know what we can see  
Why don't you tell your dreams to me?, fantasy will set you free.  
Last night I held Aladdin's lamp, and so I wished that I could stay.  
Before the thing could answer me well someone came and took the lamp away  
I looked around, a lousy candle was all I found.  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?  
Well, you don't know what we can see  
Why don't you tell your dreams to me? Fantasy will set you free.  
Close your eyes girl, look inside girl, let the Sound take you away.  
You don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?  
Well, you don't know what we can find  
Why don't you come with me little girl on a magic carpet ride?

If one kiss led to another, baby  
I'm ready to forgive you honey  
There's a light that shines between us  
And it's worth the crying, lady  
  
I was falling on sharp stones then  
And my bones were cracking daily  
No more weeping and lying now  
And I'm holding you forever  
And I'm holding you forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from the push and shove  
Let us blend together  
Find us and forgive us  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from the push and shove  
Let us blend together  
Find us and forgive us  
  
Time they say, is the great healer  
But I believe in chemicals baby  
When the waves come crashing in  
We are closer now than ever  
We are closer now than ever  
  
There was a cold space between us  
Still we bridged that chasm lady  
Desire love and friendship  
We are sanctified together  
We are sanctified together  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
Love love Lord above  
Love love Lord above  
Love love Lord above  
Save us from that push and shove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
Love

I was moving forward  
From the point I've come from  
I was rolling lowly  
This is our song now  
  
I was moving forward  
From the point I've come from  
I was rolling lowly  
This is our song now  
  
Gotta see it  
Nothing means I gotta gotta  
Feel it  
Everything is out I gotta  
Hold out  
Everything is out I gotta  
Day out  
Just invite them  
Gotta  
Bore them  
Till I take us out  
I gotta feel like  
Every single line  
I gotta  
Clean it out to the side  
When we're not down and out  
  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
  
Burning down the city  
Warning out of something  
But I need to find it  
'Cause I got no sun down  
  
Dug a whole was so fun  
And a taste that's floating  
What it doesn't meet no  
Place to silent sleep now  
  
I gotta feeling  
Doesn't mean I sad because I  
Love me  
Everything around it isn't  
Better  
If you sing it loud and I  
Jam myself to dawn  
I got  
So much dissing at the side and  
When its  
Just another ride and you  
Sow yourself to the cat  
Bet it  
  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
Put it back together  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
(Yeah yeah yeah)  
(Yeah yeah yeah)

We're alone, each with our very own lives to lead,  
we carry our walls around in our pockets,  
Electricity crackles and bricks turn to dust,  
when you're there...  
  
I get a rush,  
straight to my head,  
I get a rush.  
I get a rush,  
down to my feet,  
I get a rush.  
  
See you there, standing with a secret smile on your face.  
I am looking at my salvation.  
Heal the broken hearts,  
feed the nation with love...  
  
A rush of wind...of blood through my veins and energy,  
you are here with me now and I love it.  
Take me away...  
Fly with me

Woman... I can't live,  
Live without you in my life.  
Woman... I need you  
Keep my mind, ??? Ised  
  
Chorus: No matter what I say or do,  
So in love with you.  
No matter what I say or do,  
So in love with you.  
  
People... Don't understand  
That my heart is in your hand,  
And we know this.  
  
When I'm in your arms,  
I am free  
  
Chorus  
  
People everywhere,  
You don't understand,  
What you're missing.  
People everywhere,  
Stop for a minute and listen.  
If you find love  
If you find love, hang on  
  
Chorus  
Na, na, na...

I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper, ha.  
Into this thing.  
  
The deeper I go,  
The more knowledge I know.  
What to sing, what to bring. What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper, deeper, deeper  
Into the vibe,  
What? ha.  
  
Chilling in the corner,  
At the shelter all by myself,  
Checkin' it out, Im not dancing no more,  
But, why? Why? Why? What?  
  
How on Earth?  
Are you supposed to vibe? around the fake ones, the one that say:  
They know what is what,  
But they don't know what is what,  
They just strut.  
What the fuck? What?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper,  
Into this thing,  
And I pretend,  
That they're not there.  
I just stare,  
Up in the booth at the dread man spinning the song, Spinning it strong  
Playing things like:  
We care bout house, we care.  
  
That's my shit, what?  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deeper  
When people start to disappear,  
It is about six o'clock,wooo, I'm feelin hot,  
Take off my sweater and my pants,  
And i start to dance,  
And all the sweat just goes down my bass?.  
  
And I pretend that,  
There's nobody there but me in this place.  
  
I get deep yo, I get deep. What? Woo!  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when he takes all the bass out the song and all you hear is highs,
and it's like: Oh shit! I get deep...  
  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep,  
I get deep when the rhythm flows through my blood like alcohol and i get
drunk, and I'm over the place.  
But I catch myself right on time, right on line with the beat, and it's so
sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet. I get deep, I get deep, I get deep.  
  
Why, if house music was air, then Dr. Love would be my song, and I would only
take deep breaths.  
And fill my lungs with the rhythm, with the bass. I get deep, I get deep.  
  
??????  
  
She said i wanna go out on a picknick with you baby, Under the big bright
yellow sun  
  
You guys, just keep it rollin'

My baby, she insylts all my friends,  
This lady, with islands to defend.  
My baby, she rules our house with force,  
She plagues me, I wish I could divorce.  
  
Playing football with my feelings,  
Making mince-meat of my friends.  
Divorce is far too good for you,  
It's death that us must part, Honey,  
Oh for these ten long years to end.  
  
My baby, I never tried to wed,  
Someone held a shotgun to my head.  
And lately I've little cause to smile,  
Ever since she goose-stepped down the aisle.  
  
My baby, she walked out in the end,  
Basically she'd shafted all her friends.  
But major peace without her won't be found,  
Till my sweetheart's rotting underground

(You maybe doing this, you maybe doing that  
A little bit of this! A little bit of that!)

Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
All you used to do was put me down  
But I found a way to pick myself up off the ground  
And all you used to do was criticize me  
But now I found the good and I emphasise, ya see  
  
You would always get so sensitive  
And try to turn your transgressions into my guiltiness  
But now I'm certain of the way I live  
And what I'm responsible for in this twisted game  
  
And it's such a shame  
That you try to make pain  
Another word for my name  
Whether giving or receiving  
It's one the same  
Just one more link  
In your long-ass chain  
But it's time to break  
This frame and my strengthful will  
Time to jump off this negative cycle we've built  
Gave my heart  
But my self-respection you won't steal  
Now it's time to let ya know if you can hear me feel me  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
So I asked my mama for her two cents  
And then I asked my little sister and I asked my friend  
Then I asked my papa once and I asked him again  
Came two little consensus from all them opinions  
That life is too short to be unhappy  
And since I know what I'm worth there'll be no settling for dirt  
Knowing what I deserve is gold  
If I want diamonds then I can't settle for coal  
  
Maybe I was just too strong to let go  
Maybe I was just too weak to let it show  
Maybe I was just too stubborn to say "No"  
But whatever the case I can't take it no more  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
Ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
ah, ah ah, ah ah ah, ahhhh ah ah, ah ah ah  
  
Sometimes I think maybe we'll patch it all up  
Like a favourite pair of jeans that you won't give up on  
Or maybe one of these arguments will make up  
And start again like when we started this up  
Back when everything was fresh  
And every moment a blessing  
I'd laugh at all of your jokes  
You'd listen to my suggestions  
One mind, one soul,  
With common decimation  
Now we can't help but fight over the direction

Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some people call me the gangster of love, yeah  
Some people walking round calling me Maurice  
'Cause I speak of the pompitous of love  
  
People talk about me, baby (People talk about me, bad to)  
They say I'm doin' you wrong, (doin' you wrong, doin' you wrong)  
Well, don't let that worry you baby (oh baby)  
'Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here at home  
(Everybody Singing Along)  
  
'Cause I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
I play the music in the sun  
  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a midnight toker  
I give my lovin' on the run  
  
You're the cutest thing  
That I ever did see  
I really love your peaches  
I want to shake your tree  
Lovey-dovey, dovey-lovey, dovey all the time  
Ooo-eee baby, I'm gonna show you a good time babe  
  
Cause I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
I play the music in the sun  
  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
I'm a midnight toker  
I sure don't want to hurt no one  
  
Come on and follow me  
You know I really want you for your company  
Even though I'm attached to you physically  
My computer mechanism wants you mentally  
(Shoo be doo be doo shoo be)  
You know I really want you for your company  
(Shoo be doo be doo doo be)  
My computer mechanism wants you mentally  
  
People keep talking bout me like a low down dog (like a low life dog)  
They say I'm doin ya wrong, doin ya wrong (doin' ya wrong)  
Well don't you know, don't you worry bout a thing pretty mama  
Cause I'm right here, right here, right here singing along  
  
Cause I'm a picker  
I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover  
And I'm a sinner  
I play the music in the sun  
  
I'm a joker  
I'm a smoker  
An I'm a fa shizzile dizzile ma nizzle fizzle bizzle  
I give my lovin' on the run

Sit back  
  
The weekend...  
Starts here  
  
These are the most  
Uhh, yeah I can see what the problem is  
You gotta get right in there and talk so the guys can hear you  
We got the same problem  
You can't hear us down there  
We can't hear you here  
But we're working on it  
Do what?  
Trying to see what else at this instant  
What do you call it  
Instant rock  
Eagle in flight  
Black Hawk four  
Whatever it is  
Going back to cloud nine  
Just more volume  
  
The weekend...

Turn on... I'm in a??? Fast??? Baby  
I??? Much, you know  
??? Take it??? Fast  
  
Some people been driving to fast,  
Some people still having a gas,  
But if there's one thing you gotta conceed,  
You gotta know who's driving you car,  
You get to fifth gear with your foot on the floor,  
Or else you're starring in "A Cruise Too Far".  
  
Turn on, tune in, cop out.  
Let it flow now mama,  
Let it flow become a woman.  
  
Some people been wasting their time,  
Some people expanding their minds,  
But if you've known love like the jokers before,  
Then you're likely to be home on the range.  
No more the Cowboy gosta flaunt his wares,  
He's been grazing on a different plain.  
  
It's easy to see why there's a thousands of people  
Are regularily turning it out,  
It's easy to find when you mess with your mind  
That you've gone beyond a resonable doubt...

"It's all in your head," she said,  
You know it's right there in you mind.  
Soul food is brain food so you get back payment in kind,  
Stroll up to the cash desk, push you trolley up that ramp.  
"The change'll do you good" she said,  
And you even get Green Stamps.  
  
We're just waiting for the story to end,  
The credits will be rolling again,  
If you make love to your enemies,  
You masturbate your friends, and that's the end.  
  
"It's all there in the past." she said,  
When the Merry Pranksters rolled,  
The cats and dogs in harmony,  
And the ppigs do what they're told.  
"Get back on the bus," she said lovin Kenny Kesey (Jones)  
The street's are paved with daisies,  
Coz we made them on our own

Come forward and get your teeth smoked, word  
Come forward and get your teeth smoked, word  
Come forward and get your teeth smoked, word  
Come forward and get your  
Come forward and get your  
Come forward and get your  
Come forward and get your  
Come forward and get your

Organically grown  
Through the hemisphere I roam  
To make love to the angels of life, yeah and my girl  
I guess you just don't understand  
It's gone beyond being a man  
As I drift off into the night  
I'm in flight  
She's a boy's scoundrel gal  
But I'm gonna hold my cool  
Cause the music rules  
Yeah, so move on baby, yeah  
  
Halfway between the gutter and the stars

If you what you wear makes you a man,  
And what you eat says who you are,  
And what you see is all you gonna get,  
Tell me what is what you is?  
  
If what it is, is what it was,  
And where it's at, is where it should have been,  
And where I am, is where am I?  
Please tell me What you is?  
  
You got to stand back, and take a look,  
You don't have to live your life by the book,  
Look underneath the skin, see what is in,  
Look out for the man.  
  
If where you're coming from, is where you've already been,  
And What's happening brother has happened,  
And why am I is the reason why I am, please tell me,  
What it what you is?
