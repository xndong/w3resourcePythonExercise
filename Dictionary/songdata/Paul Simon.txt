The problem is all inside your head she said to me  
The answer is easy if you take it logically  
I'd like to help you in your struggle to be free  
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover  
  
She said it's really not my habit to intrude  
Furthermore, I hope my meaning won't be lost or misconstrued  
But I'll repeat myself at the risk of being crude  
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover  
Fifty ways to leave your lover  
  
You just slip out the back, Jack  
Make a new plan, Stan  
You don't need to be coy, Roy  
Just get yourself free  
Hop on the bus, Gus  
You don't need to discuss much  
Just drop off the key, Lee  
And get yourself free  
  
She said it grieves me so to see you in such pain  
I wish there was something I could do to make you smile again  
I said I appreciate that and would you please explain  
About the fifty ways  
  
She said why don't we both just sleep on it tonight  
And I believe in the morning you'll begin to see the light  
And then she kissed me and I realized she probably was right  
There must be fifty ways to leave your lover  
Fifty ways to leave your lover  
  
You just slip out the back, Jack  
Make a new plan, Stan  
You don't need to be coy, Roy  
Just get yourself free  
Hop on the bus, Gus  
You don't need to discuss much  
Just drop off the key, Lee  
And get yourself free

He was a most peculiar man  
That's what Mrs. Reardon says  
And she should know  
She lived upstairs from him  
She said he was a most peculiar man  
He was a most peculiar man  
He lived all alone within a house  
Within a room, within himself  
A most peculiar man  
He had no friends, he seldom spoke  
And no one in turn ever spoke to him  
'Cause he wasn't friendly and he didn't  
Care  
And he wasn't like them  
O, no-o-o!  
He was a most peculiar man  
He died last Sat-ur-day...  
He turned on the gas! and he went to sleep!  
With the windows closed!  
So he'd never wake up!  
To his silent world!  
And his tiny room!  
And Mrs Reardon says he has a brother somewhere!  
Who should be notified so-oo-oon...  
And all the people said,  
What a shame that he's dead,  
But wasn't he a most peculiar man?

Some people say Jesus that's the ace in the hole  
But I never met the man so I don't really know  
Maybe some Christmas if I'm sick and alone  
He will look up my number  
Call me on the phone and say  
Hey, boy, where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole  
  
Two hundred dollars, that's my ace in the hole  
When I'm down, dirty and desperate  
That's my emergency bank roll (I got)  
Two hundred dollars, that's the price on the street  
If you want to get some quality  
That's the price you got to meet (and the man says)  
Hey, Junior, where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole  
(Talk about ace in the hole)  
  
Once I was crazy and my ace in the hole  
Was that I knew that I was crazy  
So I never lost my self-control  
I just walk in the middle of the road and  
I sleep in the middle of the bed  
I stop in the middle of a sentence  
And the voice in the middle of my head said  
Hey, Junior, where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole (oh yeah)  
  
Ace in the hole  
Lean on me  
Don't you know me  
I'm your guarantee  
  
Riding on this rolling bus  
Beneath a stony sky  
With a slow moon rising  
And the smokestacks drifting by  
In the hour when the heart is weak  
And the memory is strong  
When time has stopped  
And the bus just rolls along  
Roll on, roll on  
Roll on, roll on  
Roll on, roll on  
  
Some people say music that's their ace in the hole  
Just your ordinary rhythm and blues  
Your basic rock and roll  
  
You can sit on the top of the beat  
You can lean on the side of the beat  
You can hang from the bottom of the beat  
But you got to admit that the music is sweet  
  
Where you been so long  
Don't you know me  
I'm your ace in the hole (oh yeah)  
  
Ace in the hole  
Lean on me  
Don't you know me  
I'm your guarantee

Over the mountain  
Down in the valley  
Lives a former talk-show host  
Everybody knows his name  
  
He says there's no doubt about it  
It was the myth of fingerprints  
I've seen them all and man  
They're all the same  
  
Well, the sun gets weary  
And the sun goes down  
Ever since the watermelon  
And the lights come up  
  
On the black pit town  
Somebody says what's a better thing to do  
Well, it's not just me  
And it's not just you  
  
This is all around the world  
  
Out in the Indian Ocean somewhere  
There's a former army post  
Abandoned now just like the war  
And there's no doubt about it  
It was the myth of fingerprints  
That's what that old army post was for  
  
Well, the sun gets bloody  
And the sun goes down  
Ever since the watermelon  
And the lights come up  
  
On the black pit town  
Somebody says what's a better thing to do  
Well, it's not just me  
And it's not just you  
  
This is all around the world  
  
Over the mountain  
Down in the valley  
Lives the former talk-show host  
Far and wide his name was known  
He said there's no doubt about it  
It was the myth of fingerprints  
That's why we must learn to live alone

Maladies  
Melodies  
Allergies to dust and grain  
Maladies  
Remedies  
Still these allergies remain  
My hand can't touch a guitar string  
My fingers just burn and ache  
My had intercedes with my bodily needs  
And my body won't give it a break  
My heart can stand a disaster  
My heart can take a disgrace  
But my heart is allergic  
To the women I love  
And it's changing the shape of my face  
  
Allergies  
Allergies  
Something's living on my skin  
Doctor please  
Doctor please  
Open up it's me again  
  
I go to a famous physician  
I sleep in the local hotel  
From what I can see of the people like me  
We get better  
But we never get well  
So I ask myself this question  
It's a question I often repeat  
Where do allergies go  
When it's after a show  
And they want to get something to eat?  
  
Allergies  
Allergies  
Something's living on my skin  
Doctor please  
Doctor please  
Open up it's me again  
  
Maladies  
Melodies  
Allergies to dust and grain  
Maladies  
Remedies  
Still these allergies remain

Many's the time I've been mistaken  
And many times confused  
Yes, and often felt forsaken  
And certainly misused  
But I'm all right, I'm all right  
I'm just weary to my bones  
Still, you don't expect to be  
Bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home, so far away from home  
  
And I don't know a soul who's not been battered  
I don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered  
Or driven to it's knees  
But it's all right, it's all right  
We've lived so well so long  
Still, when I think of the road  
We're traveling on  
I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong  
  
And I dreamed I was dying  
I dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
And looking back down at me  
Smiled reassuringly  
And I dreamed I was flying  
And high up above my eyes could clearly see  
The Statue of Liberty  
Sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was flying  
  
We come on the ship they call the Mayflower  
We come on the ship that sailed the moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hour  
And sing an American tune  
But it's all right, it's all right  
You can't be forever blessed  
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day  
And I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying to get some rest

Snowman sittin' in the sun doesn't have time to waste  
He had a little bit too much fun  
Now his head's erased  
Back in the house, family of three  
Two doin' the laundry and one in the nursery  
  
We brought a brand new baby back from Bangladesh  
Thought we'd name her Emily  
She's beautiful. Beautiful  
  
Yes, sir, head's erased, brain's a bowl of jelly  
Hasn't hurt his sense of taste  
Judging from his belly  
But back in the house, family of four now  
Two doin' the laundry and two on he kitchen floor  
  
We brought a brand new baby back from mainland China  
Sailed across the China Sea  
She's beautiful. Beautiful  
  
Go-kart sittin' in the shade  
You don't need a ticket to ride  
It's summertime, summertime  
Slip down a water slide  
Little kid dancin' in the grass  
Legs like rubber band  
It's summertime, summertime  
There's a line at the candy stand  
Keep an eye on them children  
Eye on them children in the pool  
You better keep an eye on them children  
Eye on them children in the pool  
  
We brought a brand new baby back from Kosovo  
That was nearly seven years ago  
He cried all night, could not sleep  
His eyes were bright, dark and deep

Fog's rollin' in off the East River bank  
Like a shroud it covers Bleeker Street  
Fills the alleys where men sleep  
Hides the shepherd from the sheep  
  
Voices leaking from a sad cafe  
Smiling faces try to understand  
I saw a shadow touch a shadow's hand  
On Bleeker Street  
  
A poet reads his crooked rhyme  
Holy, holy is his sacrament  
Thirty dollars pays your rent  
On Bleeker Street  
  
I head a church bell softly chime  
In a melody sustainin'  
It's a long road to Caanan  
On Bleeker Street  
Bleeker Street

Blessed are the meek for they shall inherit.  
Blessed is the lamb whose blood flows.  
Blessed are the sat upon, Spat upon, Ratted on,  
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?  
I got no place to go,  
I've walked around Soho for the last night or so.  
Ah, but it doesn't matter, no.  
  
Blessed is the land and the kingdom.  
Blessed is the man whose soul belongs to.  
Blessed are the meth drinkers, Pot sellers, Illusion dwellers.  
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?  
My words trickle down, like a wound  
That I have no intention to heal.  
  
Blessed are the stained glass, window pane glass.  
Blessed is the church service makes me nervous  
Blessed are the penny rookers, Cheap hookers, Groovy lookers.  
O Lord, Why have you forsaken me?  
I have tended my own garden  
Much too long.

Blues Run the Game Lyrics  
Written by Jackson C. Frank  
  
Catch a boat to England, baby,  
Maybe to Spain,  
Wherever I have gone,  
Wherever I've been and gone,  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues have run the game.  
  
Send out for whisky, baby,  
Send out for gin,  
Me and room service, honey,  
Me and room service, babe,  
Me and room service  
Well, we're living a life of sin  
  
When I ain't drinking, baby,  
You are on my mind,  
When I ain't sleeping, honey,  
When I ain't sleeping, Mama,  
When I ain't sleeping  
Well you know you'll find me crying.  
  
Catch a boat to England, baby,  
Maybe to Spain,  
Wherever I have gone,  
Wherever I've been and gone,  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues have run the game.  
  
Living is a gamble, baby,  
Loving's much the same,  
Wherever I have played,  
Wherever I throw those dice,  
Wherever I have played  
The blues have run the game.  
  
Maybe when I'm older, baby,  
Someplace down the line,  
I'll wake up older,  
So much older, Mama,  
Wake up older  
And I'll just stop all my trying.  
  
Catch a boat to England, baby,  
Maybe to Spain,  
Wherever I have gone,  
Wherever I've been and gone,  
Wherever I have gone  
The blues, they're all the same.

Down among the reeds and rushes  
A baby boy was found  
His eyes as clear as centuries  
His silky hair was brown  
  
Never been lonely  
Never been lied to  
Never had to scuffle in fear  
Nothing denied to  
Born at the instant  
The church bells chime  
And the whole world whispering  
Born at the right time  
  
Me and my buddies we are traveling people  
We like to go down to restaurant row  
Spend those Euro-dollars  
All the way from Washington to Tokyo  
I see them in the airport lounge  
Upon their mother's breast  
They follow me with open eyes  
Their uninvited guest  
  
Never been lonely  
Never been lied to  
Never had to scuffle in fear  
Nothing denied to  
Born at the instant  
The church bells chime  
And the whole world whispering  
Born at the right time  
  
Too many people on the bus from the airport  
Too many holes in the crust of the earth  
The planet groans  
Every time it registers another birth  
  
But down among the reeds and rushes  
A baby girl was found  
Her eyes as clear as centuries  
Her silky hair was brown  
  
Never been lonely  
Never been lied to  
Never had to scuffle in fear  
Nothing denied to  
Born at the instant  
The church bells chime  
And the whole world whispering  
Born at the right time

I was born in Puerto Rico  
We came here when I was a child  
Before I made to my sixteenth  
I was running with the gang and we were wild.  
  
He keeps looking but don't recognize me.  
Some guy from Lexington or Park  
Rrd beans and rice from kitchen windows  
It's supper-time and the barrio is dark.  
  
No one knows you like I do  
No one can know your heart the way I do  
No one can testify to all that you've been though  
But I will.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
And my blood is taino  
Spanish Caribbean in my soul  
We came here wearing summer clothes in winter  
Hearts of sunshine in the cold.  
  
Your family rented this apartment  
You'd watch the street lamps from your perch  
In the sacramental house your stepfather in black  
Preached the fire of the pentecostal church.  
  
No one knows you like I do  
Nobody can know your heart the way i do  
No one can testify to all that you've been through  
But this will.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Came here when I was a child.  
Small change and sunlight, then I left these streets for good.  
My days as short as they were wild.  
  
I'm Frenchy Cordero, I'm Angel Soto  
Indio Rivera, 'Baboo' Charlie Cruz  
The faces blurred in every grainy photo  
And fading headline of the Daily News  
  
Judge's Voice  
Wiltwych School for Criminal Children  
Auburn, Brooklyn House of D.,  
Dannemora, Sing-Sing, Attica,  
Greenhaven  
  
Twenty years inside, today you're free  
  
You cannot even read your story  
The pages piling up in shame  
Before the words released you, the  
Guard would kill the light  
The night you took The Capeman for your name.  
  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
I was born in Puerto Rico  
Yo nacir in Puerto Rico  
All my heart is Puerto Rico  
All my soul is Puerto Rico

Is it a kind of dream,  
Floating out on the tide,  
Following the river of death downstream?  
Oh, is it a dream?  
  
There's a fog along the horizon,  
A strange glow in the sky,  
And nobody seems to know where you go,  
And what does it mean?  
Oh, is it a dream?  
  
Bright eyes,  
Burning like fire.  
Bright eyes,  
How can you close and fail?  
How can the light that burned so brightly  
Suddenly burn so pale?  
Bright eyes.  
  
Is it a kind of shadow,  
Reaching into the night,  
Wandering over the hills unseen,  
Or is it a dream?  
  
There's a high wind in the trees,  
A cold sound in the air,  
And nobody ever knows when you go,  
And where do you start,  
Oh, into the dark.  
  
Bright eyes,  
Burning like fire.  
Bright eyes,  
How can you close and fail?  
How can the light that burned so brightly  
Suddenly burn so pale?  
Bright eyes.  
  
Bright eyes,  
Burning like fire.  
Bright eyes,  
How can you close and fail?  
How can the light that burned so brightly  
Suddenly burn so pale?  
Bright eyes.

[Chorus]  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye happiness  
Hello loneliness  
I think I'm gonna cry  
Bye bye love  
Bye bye sweet caress  
Hello emptiness  
I feel like I could die  
Bye bye my love, goodbye  
  
There goes my baby  
With someone new  
She sure looks happy  
I sure am blue  
She was my baby  
Till he stepped in  
Goodbye to romance  
That might have been  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm through with romance  
I'm through with love  
I'm through with counting  
The stars above  
And here's the reason  
That I'm so free  
My loving baby  
Is through with me  
  
[Chorus]

I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
  
A cooling system  
Burns out the Ukraine  
Trees and umbrellas  
Protect us from the new rain  
Armies of engineers  
To analyze the soil  
The food we contemplate  
The water that we boil  
  
I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
Oo-we Oo-we  
  
I had a dream about us  
In the bottles and the bones of the night  
I felt a pain in my shoulder blade  
Like a pencil point? A love bite?  
A couple was rubbing against us  
Rubbing and doing that new dance  
The man was wearing a jacket and jeans  
The woman was laughing in advance  
  
I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
  
A winding river  
Gets wound around a heart. Pull it  
  
Tighter and tighter  
Until the muddy waters part  
Down by the river bank  
A blues band arrives  
The music suffers  
The music business thrives  
  
I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
I can't run but  
I can walk much faster than this  
Can't run but  
Oo-we Oo-we

Cloudy  
The sky is gray and white and cloudy,  
Sometimes I think it's hanging down on me.  
And it's a hitchhike a hundred miles.  
I'm a rag-a-muffin child.  
Pointed finger-painted smile.  
I left my shadow waiting down the road for me a while.  
  
Cloudy  
My thoughts are scattered and they're cloudy,  
They have no borders, no boundaries.  
They echo and they swell  
From Tolstoy to Tinker Bell.  
Down from Berkeley to Carmel.  
Got some pictures in my pocket and a lot of time to kill.  
  
Hey sunshine  
I haven't seen you in a long time.  
Why don't you show your face and bend my mind?  
These clouds stick to the sky  
Like floating questions, why?  
And they linger there to die.  
They don't know where they are going, and, my friend, neither do I.  
  
Cloudy,  
Cloudy.

Congratulations!  
Oh, seems like you've done it again,  
And  
I ain't had such misery since  
I don't know when,  
Oh, and I don't know when,  
Oh, and I don't know when.  
  
I notice so many people slippin' away,  
And many more waiting in the lines  
In the courtrooms today,  
Oh, in the courtrooms today.  
  
Love is not a game,  
Love is not a toy,  
Love's no romance.  
Love will do you in, and love will wash you out,  
And needless to say you won't stand a chance,  
And you won't stand a chance.  
  
I'm hungry for learnin',  
Won't you answer me, please.  
Can a man and a woman live together in peace,  
Oh, live together in peace?

Fat Charlie the Archangel  
Sloped into the room  
He said I have no opinion about this  
And I have no opinion about that  
  
Sad as a lonely little wrinkled balloon  
He said well I don't claim to be happy about this, boys  
And I don't seem to be happy about that  
  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
  
She says she knows about jokes  
This time the joke is on me  
Well, I have no opinion about that  
And I have no opinion about me  
  
Somebody could walk into this room  
And say your life is on fire  
It's all over the evening news  
All about the fire in your life  
On the evening news  
  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
  
Fat Charlie the Archangel  
Files for divorce  
He says well this will eat up a year of my life  
And then there's all that weight to be lost  
She says the joke is on me  
I say the joke is on her  
I said I have no opinion about that  
Well, we'll just have to wait and confer  
  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of your love  
I don't want no part of this crazy love  
I don't want no part of this crazy love

Truth or lie, the silence is revealing  
An empty sky, a hidden mound of stone  
But the CAT scan's eye sees what the heart's concealing  
Nowadays, when everything is known  
Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true  
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue  
Dazzling blue  
  
Miles apart, though the miles can't measure distance  
Worlds apart on a rainy afternoon  
But the road gets dirty and it offers no resistance  
So turn your amp up and play your lonesome tune  
Maybe love's an accident, or destiny is true  
But you and I were born beneath a star of dazzling blue  
Dazzling blue  
  
Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen  
To make a marriage bed  
And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through  
And dream our dreams of dazzling blue  
  
Sweet July, and we drove the Montauk Highway  
And walked along the cliffs above the sea  
And we wondered why, and imagined it was someday  
And that is how the future came to be  
  
Dazzling blue, roses red, fine white linen  
To make a marriage bed  
And we'll build a wall that nothing can break through  
And dream our dreams of dazzling blue

(A-wa) O kodwa you zo-nge li-sa namhlange  
(A-wa a-wa) Si-bona kwenze ka kanjani  
(A-wa a-wa) Amanto mbazane ayeza  
She's a rich girl  
She don't try to hide it  
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
  
He's a poor boy  
Empty as a pocket  
Empty as a pocket with nothing to lose  
Sing Ta na na  
Ta na na na  
  
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
  
People say she's crazy  
She got diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
Well that's one way to lose these  
Walking blues  
Diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
  
She was physically forgotten  
Then she slipped into my pocket  
With my car keys  
She said you've taken me for granted  
Because I please you  
Wearing these diamonds  
  
And I could say Oo oo oo  
As if everybody knows  
What I'm talking about  
As if everybody would know  
Exactly what I was talking about  
Talking about diamonds on the soles of her shoes  
  
She makes the sign of a teaspoon  
He makes the sign of a wave  
The poor boy changes clothes  
And puts on after-shave  
To compensate for his ordinary shoes  
  
And she said honey take me dancing  
But they ended up by sleeping  
In a doorway  
By the bodegas and the lights on  
Upper Broadway  
Wearing diamonds on the soles of their shoes  
  
And I could say Oo oo oo  
As if everybody here would know  
What I was talking about  
I mean everybody here would know exactly  
What I was talking about  
Talking about diamonds  
  
People say I'm crazy  
I got diamonds on the soles of my shoes  
Well that's one way to lose  
These walking blues  
Diamonds on the soles of our shoes

Couple in the next room  
bound to win a prize:  
they've been going at it all night long!  
Well, I'm tryin' to get some sleep  
but these motel walls are cheap:  
Lincoln Duncan is my name,  
and here's my song, here's my song.  
  
My father was a fisherman,  
my mama was a fisherman's friend,  
and I was born in the boredom and the chowder.  
So when I reached my prime  
I left my home in the Maritimes,  
headed down the turnpike for New England, sweet New England.  
  
Holes in my confidence,  
holes in the knees of my jeans,  
I was left without a penny in my pocket  
Oo-oowee, I was about as destituted as a kid could be  
and I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it  
I'd like to hock it  
  
A young girl in a parkin' lot  
was preaching to a crowd,  
singing sacred songs  
and reading from the Bible.  
Well, I told her I was lost  
and she told all about the Pentecost,  
and I seen that girl as the road to my survival,  
my survival.  
  
Just later on  
the very same night  
when I crept to her tent with a flashlight  
and my long years of innocence ended:  
well, she took me to the woods,  
sayin' "Here comes something, and it feels so good!",  
and just like a dog I was befriended, I was befriended.  
  
Oh, oh, what a night,  
oh, what a garden of delight  
Even now that sweet memory lingers:  
I was playing my guitar  
lyin' underneath the stars  
just thankin' the Lord  
for my fingers,  
for my fingers

I'd rather be a sparrow than a snail  
Yes I would  
If I could, I surely would  
I'd rather be a hammer than a nail.  
Yes I would  
If I only could, I surely would.  
  
Away, I'd rather sail away  
Like a swan that's here and gone  
A man gets tied up to the ground  
He gives the world  
Its saddest sound, its saddest sound  
  
I'd rather be a forest than a street.  
Yes I would  
If I could, I surely would.  
I'd rather feel the earth beneath my feet  
Yes I would  
If I only could, I surely would

If she stays, she stays here.  
The girl does what she wants to do.  
She knows what she wants to do.  
And I know I'm fakin' it,  
I'm not really makin' it.  
  
I'm such a dubious soul,  
And a walk in the garden  
Wears me down.  
Tangled in the fallen vines,  
Pickin' up the punch lines,  
I've just been fakin' it,  
Not really makin' it.  
  
Is there any danger?  
No, no, not really.  
Just lean on me.  
Takin' time to treat  
Your friendly neighbors honestly.  
I've just been fakin' it,  
I'm not really makin' it.  
This feeling of fakin' it-  
I still haven't shaken it.  
  
Prior to this lifetime  
I surely was a tailor.  
("Good morning, Mr. Leitch.  
Have you had a busy day? ")  
I own the tailor's face and hands  
I am the tailor's face and hands and  
I know I'm fakin' it,  
I'm not really makin' it.  
This feeling of fakin' it-  
I still haven't shaken it.

Feuilles oh, sauv? La vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh  
Feuilles oh, sauv? La vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh  
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si me l'eau  
Pitie moi malade, mon coeur caille gang-gang, si lu bon gang-gang

Sauv? La vie moi, dans mes yeux mouilles oh  
Dans mes yeux mouilles oh  
English translation:  
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes  
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes  
Pity sick me, my heart is frozen, doctor, like the water  
Pity sick me, my heart is frozen, doctor, if you read me, good doctor  
Save my life, in my wet eyes  
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes  
Oh leaves, save my life, in my wet eyes  
Pity sick me, my heart is frozen, doctor, like the water  
Pity sick me, my heart is frozen, doctor, if you read me, good doctor  
Save my life, in my wet eyes  
In my wet eyes

Through the corridors of sleep  
Past the shadows dark and deep  
My mind dances and leaps in confusion.  
I don't know what is real,  
I can't touch what I feel  
And I hide behind the shield of my illusion.  
So I'll continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end,  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.  
The mirror on my wall  
Casts an image dark and small  
But I'm not sure at all it's my reflection.  
I am blinded by the light  
Of God and truth and right  
  
And I wander in the night without direction.  
So I'll continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end,  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall.  
It's no matter if you're born  
To play the King or pawn  
For the line is thinly drawn 'tween joy and sorrow,  
So my fantasy  
Becomes reality,  
And I must be what I must be and face tomorrow.  
So I'll continue to continue to pretend  
My life will never end,  
And Flowers Never Bend With The Rainfall

From early in November to the last week of December  
I got money matters weighing me down  
Oh the music may be merry, but it's only temporary  
I know Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
In the days I work my day job, in the nights I work my night  
But it all comes down to working man's pay  
Getting ready, I'm getting ready, ready for Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready for Christmas Day  
And let me tell you, namely, the undertaker, he's getting ready for your body  
Not only that, the jailer he's getting ready for you  
Christmas Day. Hmm? And not only the jailer, but the lawyer, the police force  
Now getting ready for Christmas Day, and I want you to bear it in mind)  
  
I got a nephew in Iraq it's his third time back  
But it's ending up the way it began  
With the luck of a beginner he'll be eating turkey dinner  
On some mountain top in Pakistan  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory  
And the story of  
Christmas Day  
  
(Getting ready, for Christmas Day  
Done made it up in your mind that I'm going, New York, Philadelphia, Chicago  
I'm going, on a trip, getting ready, for Christmas Day  
But when Christmas come, nobody knows where you'll be  
You might ask me. I may be layin' in some lonesome grave  
Getting ready, for Christmas Day)  
  
Getting ready, oh we're getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day  
Yes, we're getting ready  
  
(Getting ready, ready for your prayers,  
"I'm going and see my relatives in a distant land"  
Getting ready, getting ready for Christmas Day)  
  
If I could tell my Mom and Dad that the things we never had  
Never mattered we were always okay  
Getting ready, oh ready, ready for Christmas Day  
Ready, getting ready  
For the power and the glory and the story of the  
Christmas Day

Lord I am a working man  
And music is my trade  
I'm traveling with this 5 piece band  
I play the ace of spades  
I have a wife and family, don't see much of me  
God bless the absentee  
  
Lord I am a surgeon  
And music is my knife  
It cuts away my sorrow  
And purifies my life  
But if I could release my heart  
From veins and arteries  
I'd say God bless the absentee  
  
I miss my woman so  
I miss my bed  
I miss those soft places  
I used to lay my head  
  
My son don't need me yet  
His bones are soft  
He flies a silver airplane  
He wears a golden cross  
  
God bless the absentee Lord  
This country's changed so fast  
The future is the present  
The present's in the past  
The highways are in litigation  
The airports disagree  
God bless the absentee

The night was black, the roads were icy  
Snow was fallin', drifts were high  
And I was weary from my driving  
And I stopped to rest for awhile  
  
I sat down at a truck stop  
I was thinking about my past  
I've had a long streak of that bad luck  
But I'm praying it's gone at last  
  
[Chorus]  
Gone at last, gone at last  
Gone at last, gone at last  
I had a long streak of bad luck  
But I pray it's gone at last  
Oo, oo, oo...  
  
I ain't dumb  
I kicked around some  
I don't fall too easily  
But that boy looked so dejected  
He just grabbed my sympathy  
  
Sweet little soul now, what's your problem?  
Tell me why you're so downcast  
I've had a long streak of bad luck  
But I pray it's gone at last  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Once in a while from out of nowhere  
When you don't expect it, and you're unprepared  
Somebody will come and lift you higher  
And your burdens will be shared  
  
Yes I do believe, if I hadn't met you  
I might still be sinking fast  
I've had a long streak of that bad luck  
But I pray it's gone at last  
  
[Chorus]

He was my brother  
Five years older than I  
He was my brother  
Twenty-three Years old the day he died  
  
Freedom writer  
They cursed my brother to his face  
Go home outsider  
This town's gonna be your buryin' place  
  
He was singin' on his knees  
An angry mob trailed along  
They shot my brother dead  
Because he hated what was wrong  
  
He was my brother  
Tears can't bring him back to me  
He was my brother  
And he died so his brothers could be free  
He died so his brothers could be free

In the blue light  
Of the Beverly Motel  
Wondering as the television burns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
  
In a fever  
I distinctly hear your voice  
Emerging from a dream, the dream returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
  
After the rain on the Interstate  
Headlights slide past the moon  
A bone-weary traveler that  
Waits by the side of the road  
Where's he going?  
  
In a dream we are lying on the top of a hill  
And headlights slide past the moon  
I roll in your arms  
And your voice is the heat of the night  
I'm on fire  
  
In a phone booth  
In some local bar and grill  
Rehearsing what I'll say, my coin returns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns  
How the heart approaches what it yearns

Acts of kindness, like breadcrumbs in a fairytale forest  
Lead us past dangers as light melts the darkness  
But I don't believe, and I'm not consoled  
I lean closer to the fire, but I'm cold  
  
The earth was born in a storm  
The waters receded, the mountains were formed  
"The universe loves a drama," you know  
And ladies and gentlemen this is the show  
  
I got a call from my broker  
The broker informed me I'm broke  
I was dealing my last hand of poker  
My cards were useless as smoke  
  
Oh, guardian angel  
Don't taunt me like this, on a clear summer evening as soft as a kiss  
My children are laughing, not a whisper of care  
My love is brushing her long chestnut hair  
I don't believe a heart can be filled to the brim  
Then vanish like mist as though life were a whim  
  
Maybe the heart is part of the mist  
And that's all that there is or could ever exist  
Maybe and maybe and maybe some more  
Maybe's the exit that I'm looking for  
  
I got a call from my broker  
The broker said he was mistaken  
Maybe some virus or brokerage joke  
And he hopes that my faith isn't shaken  
  
Acts of kindness  
Like rain in a draught  
Release the spirit with a whoop and a shout  
I don't believe we were born to be sheep in a flock  
To pantomime prayers with the hands of a clock

She looked me over  
And I guess she thought  
I was all right  
All right in a sort of a limited way  
For an off-night  
She said don't I know you  
From the cinematographer's party  
I said who am I  
To blow against the wind  
I know what I know  
I'll sing what I said  
We come and we go  
That's a thing that I keep  
In the back of my head  
  
She said there's something about you  
That really reminds me of money  
She is the kind of a girl  
Who could say things that  
Weren't that funny  
I said what does that mean  
I really remind you of money  
She said who am I  
To blow against the wind  
  
I know what I know  
I'll sing what I said  
We come and we go  
That's a thing that I keep  
In the back of my head  
  
She moved so easily  
All I could think of was sunlight  
I said aren't you the women  
Who was recently given a Fulbright  
She said don't I know you  
From the cinematographer's party  
I said who am I  
To blow against the wind  
  
I know what I know  
I'll sing what I said  
We come and we go  
That's a thing that I keep  
In the back of my head

In the sea,  
The fish have learned to fly  
On a moonlit night  
On wings of silver  
As the enchanted stars  
Sail serenely by.  
Do they know  
Where do unicorns go?  
Where winged horses fly?  
Narwhals lost at sea  
And never seen again.  
Go.  
Go and ask the magpie  
"Where do unicorns go?"  
In the trees  
The birds have learned to speak  
Many colored  
They keep their secrets  
In a parade of clouds  
Playing hide and seek.  
Do they know  
Where do unicorns go?  
Where winged horses fly?  
Narwhals lost at sea  
And never seen again.  
Does myth  
And mystery lie  
Where the unicorns go?

I hear the drizzle of the rain  
Like a memory it falls  
Soft and warm continuing  
Tapping on my roof and walls.  
  
And from the shelter of my mind  
Through the window of my eyes  
I gaze beyond the rain-drenched streets  
To England where my heart lies.  
  
My mind's distracted and diffused  
My thoughts are many miles away  
They lie with you when you're asleep  
And kiss you when you start your day.  
  
And a song I was writing is left undone  
I don't know why I spend my time  
Writing songs I can't believe  
With words that tear and strain to rhyme.  
  
And so you see I have come to doubt  
All that I once held as true  
I stand alone without beliefs  
The only truth I know is you.  
  
And as I watch the drops of rain  
Weave their weary paths and die  
I know that I am like the rain  
There but for the grace of you go I

Gee but it's great to be back home  
Home is where I want to be  
I've been on the road so long my friend  
That if you came along I know you couldn't disagree  
Its the same old story  
Everywhere I go I get slandered  
Libeled, I hear words I never heard in the bible  
And I'm one step ahead of the shoeshine  
Two steps away from the county line  
Just trying to keep my customers satisfied  
Satisfied  
  
Deputy sheriff said to me  
Tell me what you came here for boy  
You better get your bags and flee  
You're in trouble boy  
And now you're heading into more  
Its the same old story  
Everywhere I go  
I get slandered  
Libeled  
I hear words I never heard in the bible  
And I'm one step ahead of the shoe shine

Sal  
I know you're trying to protect me  
Searching for another truth  
With your language and your poetry  
From my ignorance and youth  
  
Hey I did not come to argue  
My life never made much sense  
I just wish that I could hug you  
You're my only defense  
  
I don't understand your writing  
I could barely sign my name  
All I ever learned was fighting  
But I'm not the only one to blame  
  
The streets were dark with danger  
I have to stand up for my friends  
In a land where I'm a stranger  
And the hatred never ends  
  
Inmate  
Killer wants to go on T. V.  
  
[interview]

When I think back  
On all the crap I learned in high school  
It's a wonder  
I can think at all  
And though my lack of education  
Hasn't hurt me none  
I can read the writing on the wall  
  
Kodachrome  
They give us those nice bright colors  
They give us the greens of summers  
Makes you think all the world's a sunny day  
I got a Nikon camera  
I love to take a photograph  
So mama don't take my Kodachrome away  
  
If you took all the girls I knew  
When I was single  
And brought them all together for one night  
I know they'd never match  
my sweet imagination  
Everything looks worse in black and white  
  
Kodachrome, etc.

You got to learn how to fall  
Before you learn to fly  
And mama, mama it ain't no lie  
Before you learn to fly  
Learn how to fall  
  
You got to drift in the breeze  
Before you set your sails  
It's an occupation where the wind prevails  
Before you set your sails  
Drift in the breeze  
  
Oh and it's the same old story  
Ever since the world began  
Everybody got the runs for glory  
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan  
Nobody stop and scrutinize the plan  
  
You got to learn how to fall  
Before you learn to fly  
The tank towns they tell no lie  
Before you learn to fly  
Learn how to fall

I was 21 years when I wrote this song  
I'm 22 now, but I won't be for long  
Time hurries on  
  
[Chorus]  
And the leaves that are green turn to brown  
And they wither with the wind  
And they crumble in your hand  
  
Once my heart was filled with the love of a girl  
I held her close, but she faded in the night  
Like a poem I meant to write  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I throw a pebble in a brook  
And watched the ripples run away  
And they never made a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hello hello hello hello  
Goodbye goodbye goodbye goodbye  
That's all there is  
And the leaves that are green turn to brown

Cool me  
Cool my fever high  
Hold me when I cry  
I need it so much  
Makes you want to get down and crawl like a beggar  
For its touch  
And all the while it's free as air  
Like plants the medicine is everywhere  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
  
We crave it so badly  
Makes you want to laugh out loud when you receive it  
And gobble it like candy  
  
We think it's easy  
Sometimes it's easy  
But it's not easy  
You're going to break down and cry  
We're not important  
We should be grateful  
And if you're wondering why  
  
Love  
Love  
Love  
  
The price that we pay  
When evil walks the planet  
And love is crushed like clay  
The master races, the chosen peoples  
The burning temples, the weeping cathedrals

God and His only Son  
Paid a courtesy call on Earth  
One Sunday morning  
Orange blossoms opened their fragrant lips  
Songbirds sang from the tips of Cottonwoods  
Old folks wept for His love in these hard times  
  
"Well, we got to get going," said the restless Lord to the Son  
There are galaxies yet to be born  
Creation is never done  
Anyway, these people are slobs here  
If we stay it's bound to be a mob scene  
But, disappear, and it's love and hard times  
  
I loved her the first time I saw her  
I know that's an old songwriting cliche  
Loved you the first time I saw you  
Can't describe it any other way  
Any other way  
The light of her beauty was warm as a summer day  
Clouds of antelope rolled by  
No hint of rain to come  
In the prairie sky  
It's just love, love, love, love, love  
  
When the rains came, the tears burned, windows rattled, locks turned  
It's easy to be generous when you're on a roll  
It's hard to be grateful when you're out of control  
And love is gone  
  
The light at the edge of the curtain  
Is the quiet dawn  
The bedroom breathes  
In clicks and clacks  
Uneasy heartbeat, can't relax  
  
But then your hand takes mine  
Thank God, I found you in time  
Thank God, I found you  
Thank God, I found you

Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness, sight without sight  
A demon that feeds on the mind  
  
How'd it all begin? Started with a bang  
Couple of light years later, stars and planets sang  
Fire warmed the cold, waves of colors flew  
Moonlight into gold, earth to green and blue  
  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness, sight without sight  
A demon that feeds on the mind  
  
Earth becomes a farm  
Farmer takes a wife  
Wife becomes a river and the giver of life  
Man becomes machine  
Oil runs down his face  
Machine becomes a man with a bomb in the marketplace  
Bomb in the marketplace, bomb in the marketplace  
  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness, sight without sight  
A demon that feeds on the mind  
  
Big Bang  
That's a joke that I made up  
Once when I had eons to kill  
You know, most folks  
They don't get when I'm joking  
Well, maybe someday they will  
  
Love me  
Love me  
That's the main request I receive  
Well you know I love all my children  
And it tears me up when I leave  
  
But sometimes you gotta fly down that highway  
Free as a bird, knock on wood, thank the Lord  
I am driving along in my automobile  
It's a brand new pre-owned '96 Ford  
  
Check out the radio, pop music station  
That don't sound like my music to me  
Talk show host, what's that boy's name?  
Politics is ugly  
  
At the end of the dial there's the gospel show  
Maybe now I can exit and rest  
There's a blizzard rolling down off the banks of Lake Michigan  
Gonna cover the roads of the icy Midwest  
  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Free from the shackles of time  
Evil is darkness, sight without sight  
A demon that feeds all the mind  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Love is eternal sacred light  
Love is eternal sacred light

When I was a little boy  
And the Devil would call my name  
I'd say "now who do  
Who do you think you're fooling?"  
I'm a consecrated boy  
Singer in a Sunday choir  
My mama loves, she loves me  
She gets down on her knees and hugs me  
She loves me like a rock  
She rocks me like the rock of ages  
And she loves me  
  
When I was grown to be a man  
And the Devil would call my name  
I'd say "now who do  
Who do you think you're fooling?"  
I'm a consummated man  
I can snatch a little purity  
My mama loves me, she loves me  
She gets down on her knees and hugs me  
She loves me like a rock  
She rocks me like the rock of ages  
And she loves me  
  
If I was President  
And the Congress call my name  
I'd say "who do  
Who do you think you're fooling?"  
I've got the Presidential Seal  
I'm up on the Presidential Podium  
My mama loves me  
She loves me  
She gets down on her knees and hugs me  
And she loves me like a rock  
She rocks me like the rock of ages  
And she loves me  
She loves me, loves me, loves me, loves me

Chorus:  
(Oh) Maybellene, why can't you be true, whoah Maybellene, why can't you be
true  
You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do  
  
As I was motivatin over the hill, I saw Maybellene in a Coup de Ville,  
A cadillac a-rollin on the open road, yeah, but nothin out race my V8 Ford,  
The Cadillac doin' 'bout 95, she's bumper to bumper, rollin' side by side.  
  
Chorus  
  
He cooled down, the motor cooled down  
That's when I'd heard that highway sound  
I kept back sittin' like a ton of lead  
Got a hundred and ten a half mile ahead  
Cadillac lookin' like it's standin' still  
And I caught Maybellene at the top of the hill

You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do  
You're not startin' right, doin' those things you used to do

The mama pajama rolled out a bed  
And she ran to the police station  
When the papa found out he began to shout  
  
And he started the investigation  
It's against the law  
It was against the law  
What the mama saw  
It was against the law.  
  
The mama look down and spit on the ground  
Every time my name gets mentioned  
The papa said, "Oy, if I get that boy,  
I'm gonna stick him the house of detention."  
Well I'm on my way.  
I don't know where I'm going  
I'm on my way I'm taking my time  
But I don't know where  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
See you, me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you, me and Julio down by the school yard  
  
In a couple of days they come and  
Take me away  
But the press let the story leak  
And when the radical priest  
Come to get me released  
We was all on the cover of Newsweek  
  
And I'm on my way  
I don't know where I'm going  
I'm on my way, I'm taking my time  
But I don't know where  
Goodbye to Rosie the queen of Corona  
See you, me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard  
See you me and Julio  
Down by the school yard

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)  
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files  
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself  
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes  
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home  
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)  
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes  
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes  
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair  
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids  
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)  
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon  
Going to the candidates debate  
Laugh about it, shout about it  
When you've got to choose  
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose  
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio  
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (Woo, woo, woo)  
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson  
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  

In my little town  
I grew up believing  
God keeps his eye on us all  
And he used to lean upon me  
As I pledged allegiance to the wall  
Lord I recall my little town  
Coming home after school  
Riding my bike past the gates of the factories  
My mom doing the laundry  
Hanging out shirts in the dirty breeze  
And after it rains there's a rainbow  
And all of the colors are black  
It's not that the colors aren't there  
It's just imagination they lack  
Everything's the same back in my little town  
In my little town I never meant nothing  
I was just my father's son  
Saving my money  
Dreamin of glory  
Twitching like a finger on a trigger of a gun  
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town  
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town  
Nothing but the dead and dying back in my little town  

There were two men down  
And the score tied  
In the bottom of the eight  
When the pitcher died  
  
And they laid his spikes  
On the pitcher's mound  
And his uniform was torn  
And his number was left on the ground  
  
Then the night turned cold  
Colder than the moon  
The stars were white as bones  
The stadium was old  
Older than the screams  
Older than these teams  
  
There were three men down  
And the season lost  
And the tarpaulin was rolled  
Upon the winter frost

Who knows my secret broken bone  
Who feels my flesh when I am gone  
Who was a witness to the dream  
Who kissed my eyes and saw the scream  
Lying there  
Nobody  
  
Who is my reason to begin  
Who plows the earth, who breaks the skin  
Who took my two hands and made them four  
Who is my heart, who is my door  
Nobody  
  
Nobody but you, girl  
Nobody but you  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Nobody  
  
Who makes the bed that can't be made  
Who is my mirror, who is my blade  
When I am rising like a flood  
Who feels the pounding in my blood  
Oh, nobody  
  
Nobody but you  
Nobody but you, girl  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Nobody, girl  
Oh, oh, nobody  
  
Oh, no-no-no, nobody but you, yeah  
Nobody but you  
Nobody in this whole wide world  
Nobody, nobody

The boy's got brains  
He just don't use 'em that's all  
The boy's got brains  
He just refuse to use 'em and that's all  
He said "the more I got to thinkin  
The less I tend to laugh"  
The boy's got brains  
He just abstains  
The boy's got a heart  
But it beats on the opposite side  
It's a strange phenomenon  
The laws of nature defied  
He said "its a chance I had to take  
So I shifted my heart for it's safety sake"  
The boy's got a heart but it beats on  
His opposite side  
Oh, marion,  
I think I'm in trouble here  
I should have believed you  
When I heard you saying it  
The only time  
That love is an easy game  
Is when two other people  
Are playing it  
The boy's got a voice  
But the voice is his natural disguise  
Yes the boy's got a voice  
But his words don't connect to his eyes  
He says "oh, but when I sing  
I can hear the truth auditioning".  
The boy's got a voice  
But the voice is natural  

Old friends, old friends sat on their parkbench like bookends  
A newspaper blowin' through the grass  
Falls on the round toes of the high shoes of the old friends  
Old friends, winter companions, the old men  
Lost in their overcoats, waiting for the sunset  
The sounds of the city sifting through trees  
Settles like dust on the shoulders of the old friends  
Can you imagine us years from today, sharing a parkbench quietly  
How terribly strange to be seventy  
Old friends, memory brushes the same years, silently sharing the same fears.  
  
Time it was and what a time it was it was...  
A time of innocence a time of confidences  
Long ago it must be, I have a photograph preserve your memories  
There all that's left of you.

Once upon a time there was an ocean  
But now it's a mountain range  
Something unstoppable set into motion  
Nothing is different, but everything's changed  
  
It's a dead end job, and you gets tired of sittin'  
And it's like a nicotine habit you're always thinking about quittin'  
I think about quittin' every day of the week  
When I look out my window it's brown and it's bleak  
  
Outta here  
How am I gonna get outta here?  
I'm thinking outta here  
When am I gonna get outta here?  
And when will I cash in my lottery ticket  
And bury my past with my burdens and strife?  
I want to shake every limb in the garden of Eden  
And make every love the love of my life  
  
I figure that once upon a time I was an ocean  
But now I'm a mountain range  
Something unstoppable set into motion  
Nothing is different, but everything's changed  
  
Found a room in the heart of the city, down by the bridge  
Hot plate and TV and beer in the fridge  
But I'm easy, I'm open, that's my gift  
I can flow with the traffic, I can drift with the drift  
Home again?  
Naw, never going home again  
Think about home again?  
I never think about home  
  
But then comes a letter from home  
The handwriting's fragile and strange  
Something unstoppable set into motion  
Nothing is different, but everything's changed  
  
The light through the stained glass was cobalt and red  
And the frayed cuffs and collars were mended by haloes of golden thread  
The choir sang, "Once Upon A Time There Was An Ocean"  
And all the old hymns and family names came fluttering down as leaves of
emotion  
  
As nothing is different, but everything's changed

There's been some hard feelings here  
About some words that were said  
There's been some hard feelings here  
And what is more  
There's been a bloody purple nose  
And some bloody purple clothes  
That were messing up the lobby floor  
It's just apartment house rules  
So all you 'partment fools  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
  
There's been some strange goin's on  
And some folks have come and gone  
And the elevator man don't work no more  
I heard a racket in the hall  
And I thought I heard a fall  
But I never opened up my door  
It's just apartment house sense  
It's like apartment rents  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
Remember: one man's ceiling  
Is another man's floor  
  
And there's an alley  
In the back of my building  
Where some people congregate in shame  
I was walking with my dog  
And the night was black with smog  
When I thought I heard somebody  
Call my name

He's a one-trick pony  
One trick is all that horse can do  
He does one trick only  
It's the principle source of his revenue  
And when he steps into the spotlight  
You can feel the heat of his heart  
Come rising through  
  
See how he dances  
See how he loops from side to side  
See how he prances  
The way his hooves just seem to glide  
He's just a one-trick pony (that's all he is)  
But he turns that trick with pride  
  
He makes it look so easy  
He looks so clean  
He moves like God's  
Immaculate machine  
He makes me think about  
All of these extra moves I make  
And all this herky-jerky motion  
And the bag of tricks it takes  
To get me through my working day  
One-trick pony  
  
He's a one-trick pony  
He either fails or he succeeds  
He gives his testimony  
Then he relaxes in the weeds  
He's got one trick to last a lifetime  
But that's all a pony needs (that's all he needs)  
  
He looks so easy  
He looks so clean  
He moves like God's  
Immaculate machine  
He makes me think about  
All of these extra moves I make  
And all this herky-jerky motion  
And the bag of tricks it takes  
To get me through my working day  
  
One-trick pony, one-trick pony  
One-trick pony, one-trick pony  
One-trick pony (take me for a ride)  
One-trick pony

It's outrageous to line your pockets off the misery of the poor.  
Outrageous the crime some human beings must endure.  
It's a blessing to wash your face in the summer solstice rain.  
It's outrageous a man like me stand here and complain.  
  
But I'm tired, nine hundred sit-ups a day.  
I'm painting my hair the colour of mud, mud, okay?  
I'm tired, tired  
Anybody care what I say? No!  
I'm painting my hair the colour of mud.  
  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Tell me, who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Aw, who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
  
It's outrageous the food they try to serve in a public school.  
Outrageous, the way they talk to you like you're some kind of clinical fool  
It's a blessing to rest my head in the circle of your love.  
It's outrageous I can't stop thinking about the things I'm thinking of.  
  
And I'm tired, nine hundred sit-ups a day.  
I'm painting my hair the colour of mud, mud, okay?  
I'm tired, tired, anybody care what I say? No!  
Painting my hair the colour of mud.  
  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Tell me, who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
Tell me, who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
  
God will,  
Like he waters the flowers on your window sill.  
Take me, I'm an ordinary player in the key of C,  
And my will was broken by my pride and my vanity  
  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?  
God will,  
Like he waters the flowers on your window sill.  
Who's gonna love you when your looks are gone?

Why don't we stop fooling ourselves?  
The game is over,  
Over,  
Over.  
  
No good times, no bad times,  
There's no times at all,  
Just The New York Times,  
Sitting on the windowsill  
Near the flowers.  
  
We might as well be apart.  
It hardly matters,  
We sleep separately.  
  
And drop a smile passing in the hall  
But there's no laughs left  
'Cause we laughed them all.  
And we laughed them all  
In a very short time.  
  
Time  
Is tapping on my forehead,  
Hanging from my mirror,  
Rattling the teacups,  
  
And I wonder,  
How long can I delay?  
We're just a habit  
Like saccharin.  
  
And I'm habitually feelin' kinda blue.  
  
But each time I try on  
The thought of leaving you,  
I stop...  
I stop and think it over

I got some so-called friends  
They'll smile right to my face  
But, when my back is turned  
They'd like to stick to me  
  
Yes they would  
Oh no, no, oh no no  
There's only one thing I need to know  
Whose side are you on  
  
I fly into J.F.K.  
My heart goes boom boom boom  
I know that customs man  
He's going to take me  
  
To that little room  
Oh no, no. Oh no, no  
There's only one thing I need to know  
Whose side are you on  
Whose side are you on  
  
I got the paranoia blues  
From knockin' around in New York City  
Where they roll you for a nickel  
And they stick you for the extra dime  
  
Anyway you choose  
You're bound to lose in New York City  
Oh I just got out in the nick of time  
Well I just got out in the nick of time  
  
Once I was down in Chinatown  
I was eating some Lin's Chow Fon  
I happened to turn around  
And when I looked I see  
  
My Chow Fon's gone  
Oh no, no. Oh no, no  
There's only one thing I need to know  
Whose side are you on, whose side are you on  
There's only one thing I need to know  
Whose side, whose side, whose side

The night sets softly  
With the hush of falling leaves,  
Casting shivering shadows  
On the houses through the trees,  
  
And the light from a street lamp  
Paints a pattern on my wall,  
Like the pieces of a puzzle  
Or a child's uneven scrawL  
  
Up a narrow flight of stairs  
In a narrow Little room,  
As I lie upon my bed  
In the early evening gloom.  
  
Impaled on my wall  
My eyes can dimly see  
The pattern of my life  
And the puzzle that is me.  
  
From the moment of my birth  
To the instant of my death,  
There are Patterns I must follow  
Just as I must breathe each breath.  
  
Like a rat in a maze  
The path before me lies,  
And the pattern never alters  
Until the rat dies.  
  
And the pattern still remains  
On the wall where darkness fell,  
And it's fitting that it should,  
For in darkness I must dwell.  
  
Like the color of my skin,  
Or the day that I grow old,  
My life is made of Patterns  
That can scarcely be controlled

Peace like a river ran through the city  
Long past the midnight curfew  
We sat starry-eyed  
We were satisfied  
  
And I remember  
Misinformation followed us like a plague  
Nobody knew from time to time  
If the plans where changed  
If the plans were changed  
  
You can beat us with wires  
You can beat us with chains  
You can run out your rules  
But you know you can't outrun the history train  
I've seen a glorious day  
  
Four in the morning  
I woke up from out of my dreams  
Nowhere to go but back to sleep  
But I'm reconciled  
  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm gonna be up for a while  
Oh, oh, oh  
I'm gonna be up for a while

As we marched down to Faneri-o  
As we marched down to Faneri-o  
Our captain fell n love with a lady like a dove  
And they called her name, pretty Peggy-o  
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-o  
Come a runnin' down the stairs, pretty Peggy-o  
Come a runnin' down the stairs, combin' back  
Your yellow hair  
You're the prettiest little girl I've ever seen-o  
  
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o  
In a carriage you will ride, pretty Peggy-o  
In a carriage you will ride, with your true love by  
Your side  
As far as any maiden in the are-e-o  
What will your mother say, pretry Peggy-o?  
What will your mother say, pretty Peggy-o?  
What will your mother say, when she finds you've  
Gone away  
To places far and strange to Faneri-o?  
  
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o  
If ever I return, pretty Peggy-o  
If ever I return, all your cities I will burn  
Destroying all the ladies in the are-e-o  
Destroying all the ladies in the are-e-o

Wish I was a Kellogg's Cornflake  
Floatin' in my bowl takin' movies,  
Relaxin' awhile, livin' in style,  
Talkin' to a raisin who 'caisson'ly plays L.A.,  
Casually glancing at his toupee.  
  
Wish I was an English muffin  
'Bout to make the most out of a toaster.  
  
I'd ease myself down,  
Comin' up brown.  
  
I prefer boysenberry  
More than any ordinary jam.  
I'm a "Citizens for Boysenberry Jam" fan.  
  
Ah, South California.  
  
If I become a first lieutenant  
Would you put my photo on your piano?  
To Maryjane  
Best wishes, Martin.  
(Old Roger draft-dodger  
Leavin' by the basement door),  
Everybody knows what he's  
Tippy-toeing down there for

Come on baby, let's go downtown  
Little girl, you sure look good to me  
The way you move

Come on baby, now don't be shy  
Step in the light so I can see  
The way you move  
It's got quality  
  
I want to know  
Are you my beautiful young boy  
Or just another love  
Passing through my life  
I need to know  
Will you be my sorrow and my joy  
And maybe one day soon  
Will I be your wife  
  
Come on baby, let's rock some more  
I want to spend my salary

A pilgrim on a pilgrimage  
Walked across the Brooklyn Bridge  
His sneakers torn  
In the hour when the homeless move their cardboard blankets  
And the new day is born  
  
Folded in his backpack pocket  
The questions that he copied from his heart  
Who am I in this lonely world?  
And where will I make my bed tonight?  
When twilight turns to dark  
  
Questions for the angels  
Who believes in angels?  
Fools do  
Fools and pilgrims all over the world  
  
If you shop for love in a bargain store  
And you don't get what you are bargain for  
Can you get your money back?  
If an empty train in a railway station  
Calls you to its destination  
Can you choose another track?  
  
Will I wake up from these violent dreams?  
With my hair as white as the morning moon?  
  
Questions for the angels  
Who believes in angels?  
I do  
Fools and pilgrims all over the world  
  
Downtown Brooklyn  
The pilgrim is passing a billboard  
And catches his eyes  
It's Jay-Z  
He's got a kid on each knee  
He is wearing clothes that he wants us to try  
  
If every human on the planet  
And all the buildings on it  
Should disappear  
Would a zebra grazing in the African Savannah  
Care enough to share one zebra tear?  
  
Questions for the angels

I should have known you'd bid me farewell  
There's a lesson to be learned from this and I've learned it very well  
Now I know you're not the only starfish in the sea  
If I never hear your name again, it's all the same to me  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
You never care for secrets I confide  
To you, I'm just an ornament, something for your pride  
Always running, never caring, that's the life you live  
Stolen minutes of your time were all you had to give  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
The story's in the past with nothing to recall  
I've got my life to live, and I don't need you at all  
The roller coaster ride we took is nearly at an end  
I bought my tickets with my tears, that's all I'm gonna spend  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
  
And I think it's gonna be all right  
Yeah, the worst is over now  
The morning sun is shining like a red rubber ball  
It's bouncing and it's shining like a red rubber ball

I'm workin' on my rewrite, that's right  
Gonna change the ending  
Throw away the title  
And toss it in the trash  
Every minute after midnight  
All the time I'm spending  
Is just for workin' on my rewrite, that's right  
Gonna turn it into cash  
  
I been workin' at the car wash  
I consider it my day job  
'Cause it's really not a pay job  
But that's where I am  
Everybody says "The old guy  
Workin' at the car wash?"  
Hasn't got a brain cell left  
Since Vietnam  
  
But I say  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohhh  
Thank you  
I'd no idea  
That you were there  
  
When I said help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohhh  
Thank you  
For listening to my prayer  
  
I'm workin' on my rewrite, that's right

Every minute after midnight  
All the time I'm spending  
Is just for workin' on my rewrite, that's right  
Gonna turn it into cash  
  
I'll eliminate the pages  
Where the father has a breakdown  
And he has to leave the family  
But he really meant no harm  
Gonna substitute a car chase  
And a race across the rooftops  
Where the father saves the children  
And he holds them in his arms  
  
I said  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohh  
Thank you  
I'd no idea  
That you were there  
  
When I said  
Help me, help me  
Help me, help me  
Ohhh  
Thank you  
For listening to my prayer

Went to my doctor yesterday  
She said I seem to be OK  
She said  
Paul you better look around  
How long you think that you can  
Run that body down?  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin'  
Who you foolin?  
  
I came back home and I went to bed  
I was resting my head  
My wife came in and she said  
What's wrong sweet boy what's wrong?  
Ah, I told her what's wrong  
I said Peg you better look around  
How long you think you can  
Run that body down  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin'  
Now, who you foolin?  
  
Kid you better look around  
How long you think that you can  
Run that body down?  
How many nights you think you can  
Do what you been doin'  
Who you foolin?

"Good God! Don't jump!"  
A boy sat on the ledge.  
An old man who had fainted was revived.  
And everyone agreed it would be a miracle indeed  
If the boy survived.  
  
"Save the life of my child!"  
Cried the desperate mother.  
  
The woman from the supermarket  
Ran to call the cops.  
"He must be high on something," someone said.  
Though it never made The New York Times.  
In The Daily News, the caption read,  
"Save the life of my child!"  
Cried the desperate mother.  
  
A patrol car passing by  
Halted to a stop.  
Said officer MacDougal in dismay:  
"The force can't do a decent job  
'Cause the kids got no respect  
For the law today (and blah blah blah)."  
  
"Save the life of my child!"  
Cried the desperate mother.  
"What's becoming of the children?"  
People asking each other.  
  
When darkness fell, excitement kissed the crowd  
And made them wild  
In an atmosphere of freaky holiday.  
When the spotlight hit the boy,  
The crowd began to cheer,  
He flew away.  
  
"Oh, my Grace, I got no hiding place."

Silent eyes  
Watching  
Jerusalem  
Make her bed of stones  
  
Silent eyes  
No one will comfort her  
Jerusalem  
Weeps alone  
  
She is sorrow  
Sorrow  
She burns like a flame  
And she calls my name  
  
Silent eyes  
Burning  
In the desert sun  
Halfway to Jerusalem  
And we shall all be called as witnesses  
Each and every one  
To stand before the eyes of god  
And speak what was done

I'm gonna make a chicken gumbo  
Toss some sausage in the pot  
I'm gonna flavor it with okra  
Cheyenne pepper to make it hot  
You know life is what we make of it  
So beautiful or so what  
I'm gonna tell my kids a bedtime story  
A play without a plot  
Will it have a happy ending?  
Maybe yeah, maybe not  
I tell them life is what you make of it  
So beautiful or so what  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
So what  
  
I'm just a raindrop in a bucket  
A coin dropped in a slot  
I am an empty house on Weed Street  
Across the road from a vacant lot  
You know life is what you make of it  
So beautiful, or so what  
  
Ain't it strange the way we're ignorant  
How we seek out bad advice  
How we jigger it and figure it  
Mistaking value for the price  
And play a game with time and love  
Like a pair of rolling dice  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
So what  
  
Four men on the balcony  
Overlooking the parking lot  
Pointing at a figure in the distance  
Dr. King has just been shot  
And the sirens long melody  
Singing savior pass me not  
Ain't it strange the way we're ignorant  
How we seek out bad advice  
How we jigger it and figure it  
Mistaking value for the price  
And play a game with time and love  
Like a pair of rolling dice  
So beautiful, so beautiful  
So beautiful

So long, Frank Lloyd Wright.  
I can't believe your song is gone so soon.  
I barely learned the tune  
So soon  
So soon  
I'll remember.  
  
Frank Lloyd Wright.  
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn.  
I never laughed so long  
So long  
So long.  
  
[Chorus]  
Architects may come and  
Architects may go and  
Never change your point of view.  
When I run dry  
I stop awhile and think of you  
  
So long, Frank Lloyd Wright  
All of the nights we'd harmonize till dawn.  
I never laughed so long  
So long  
So long.

Some folks' lives roll easy as a breeze  
Drifting through a summer night  
Heading for a sunny day  
But most folks' lives, oh they stumble  
  
Lord they fall  
Through no fault of their own  
Most folks never catch their stars  
  
And here I am, Lord  
I'm knocking at your place of business  
I know I ain't got no business here  
But you said if I ever got so low  
I was busted,  
You could be trusted  
  
Some folks' lives roll easy  
Some folks' lives  
Never roll at all  
Oh, they just fall  
They just fall  
Some folks' lives

Hello darkness, my old friend  
I've come to talk with you again  
Because a vision softly creeping  
Left its seeds while I was sleeping  
And the vision that was planted in my brain  
Still remains  
Within the sound of silence  
  
In restless dreams I walked alone  
Narrow streets of cobblestone  
'Neath the halo of a street lamp  
I turned my collar to the cold and damp  
When my eyes were stabbed by the flash of a neon light  
That split the night  
And touched the sound of silence  
  
And in the naked light I saw  
Ten thousand people, maybe more  
People talking without speaking  
People hearing without listening  
People writing songs that voices never share  
And no one dared  
Disturb the sound of silence  
  
"Fools", said I, "You do not know  
Silence like a cancer grows  
Hear my words that I might teach you  
Take my arms that I might reach you"  
But my words, like silent raindrops fell  
And echoed  
In the wells of silence  
  
And the people bowed and prayed  
To the neon god they made  
And the sign flashed out its warning  
In the words that it was forming  
And the sign said, "The words of the prophets are written on the subway walls  
And tenement halls"  
And whispered in the sounds of silence

Who will love a little Sparrow?  
Who's traveled far and cries for rest?  
"Not I," said the Oak Tree,  
"I won't share my branches with  
No sparrow's nest,  
And my blanket of leaves won't warm  
Her cold breast."  
  
Who will love a little Sparrow  
And who will speak a kindly word?  
"Not I," said the Swan,  
"The entire idea is utterly absurd,  
I'd be laughed at and scorned if the  
Other Swans heard."  
  
Who will take pity in his heart,  
And who will feed a starving sparrow?  
"Not I," said the Golden Wheat,  
"I would if I could but I cannot I know,  
I need all my grain to prosper and grow."  
  
Who will love a little Sparrow?  
Will no one write her eulogy?  
"I will," said the Earth,  
"For all I've created returns unto me,  
From dust were ye made and dust ye shall be."

Little sleepy boy  
Do you know what time it is?  
Well the hour of your bedtime's  
Long been past  
And though I know you're fighting it  
I can tell when you rub your eyes  
You're fading fast  
Fading fast  
  
Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet  
Roll across the skies  
And leave a spray of diamonds  
In its wake  
I long to see St. Judy's Comet  
Sparkle in your eyes  
When you awake  
  
Little boy  
Won't you lay your body down  
Little boy  
Won't you close your weary eyes  
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies  
  
Well I sang it once  
And I sang it twice  
I'm going to sing it three times more  
Going to stay til your resistance  
Is overcome  
Cause if I can't sing my boy to sleep  
Well it makes your famous daddy  
Look so dumb  
  
Won't you run come see St. Judy's Comet  
Roll across the skies  
And leave a spray of diamonds  
In its wake  
I long to see St. Judy's Comet  
Sparkle in your eyes  
When you awake  
  
Little boy, little boy  
Won't you lay your body down  
Little boy, little boy  
Won't you close your weary eyes  
Ain't nothing flashing but the fireflies  
  
Oo Little sleepy boy  
Do you know what time it is?  
Well the hour of your bedtime's  
Long been past  
Though I know you're fighting it  
I can tell when you rub your eyes  
That you're fading fast

Long years ago on a deep winter night  
High in the heavens, a star shone bright  
While in the manger, a wee baby lay  
Sweetly asleep on a bed of hay  
  
Jesus our Lord was that baby so small  
Laid down to sleep in a humble stall  
Then came the star and it stood overhead  
Shedding its light 'round His little head  
  
Dear baby Jesus, how tiny Thou art  
I'll make a place for Thee in my heart  
And when the stars in the heavens I see  
Ever and always I think of Thee

I met my old lover  
On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
I'm not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should I?  
Its all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

I registered to vote today  
Felt like a fool  
Had to do it anyway  
Down at the high school  
Thing about the second line  
You know, felt like a fool?  
People say it all the time  
Even when it's true  
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Cause it sure don't feel like love  
  
A tear drop consists of electrolytes and salt  
The chemistry of crying is not concerned with blame or fault  
So, who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
Who's that conscience sticking on the sole of my shoe?  
'Cause it sure don't feel like love  
How does it feel?  
Feels like a threat  
A voice in your head that you'd rather forget  
No joke, no joke  
You get sick from that unspoken  
Sure don't feel like love  
No joke, no joke  
Some chicken and a corn muffin well that feels more like love  
  
Yay! Boo!  
Yay! Boo!  
  
Wrong again, wrong again  
Maybe I'm wrong again  
Wrong again  
Maybe I'm wrong again  
Wrong again  
I could be wrong again  
I remember once in August 1993  
I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember one of my best friends turned enemy  
So, I was wrong, and I could be wrong again  
I remember once in a load-out, down in Birmingham  
Yeah, but that didn't feel like love  
Sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like love  
Sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like, sure don't feel like love  
It sure. Don't feel  
Like love

C'mon take me to the Mardi Gras  
Where the people sing and play  
Where the dancing is elite  
And there's music in the street  
Both night and day  
  
Hurry take me to the Mardi Gras  
In the city of my dreams  
You can legalize your lows  
You can wear your summer clothes  
In the New Orleans  
  
And I will lay my burden down  
Rest my head upon that shore  
And when I wear that starry crown  
I won't be wanting anymore  
  
Take your burdens to the Mardi Gras  
Let the music wash your soul  
You can mingle in the street  
You can jingle to the beat  
Of Jelly Roll

What can I do  
What can I do  
Much of what you say is true  
I know you see through me  
But there's no tenderness  
Beneath your honesty  
  
Right and wrong  
Right and wrong  
Never helped us get along  
You say you care for me  
But there's no tenderness  
Beneath your honesty  
  
You and me were such good friends  
What's your hurry?  
You and me could make amends  
I'm not worried  
I'm not worried  
  
Honesty  
Honesty  
It's such a waste of energy  
No you don't have to lie to me  
Just give me some tenderness  
Beneath your honesty  
You don't have to lie to me  
Just give me some tenderness

In a vine covered  
Shack in the mountains  
Bravely fighting  
The battle of time  
There's a dear one  
Who's wept  
Through life's sorrows  
It's that silver  
Haired daddy of mine  
  
If I could recall  
All the heartaches  
Dear ole daddy  
I've caused you to bear  
If I could erase  
Those lines from your face  
And bring back  
The gold to your hair  
If God would but  
Grant me the power  
Just to turn back  
The pages of time  
I would give all  
I own just to put a tone  
To that silver  
Haired daddy of mine

When I was born  
My mother died  
She said,'Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
I said,'Where you goin'?  
I'm just born  
She said,'I'll only be gone for a while'  
My mother loved to leave in style  
That's why God made the movies  
  
Well, I laid around  
In my swaddling clothes  
Until the doctor came and turned out the lights  
Then I packed my bag  
And my name tag  
I stole away into the night  
Hoping things would work out right  
That's why God made the movies  
  
Say you will! Say you will!  
Say you'll take me to your lovin' breast  
Say you'll nourish me  
With your tenderness  
The way the ladies sometimes do  
Say you won't! Say you won't!  
Say you won't leave me for no other man  
Say you'll love me just the way I am  
Say you will baby, now  
Say you will, just say you will  
  
When I was born  
My mother died  
She said,'Bye bye, baby, bye bye  
And since that day  
I've paid my way  
The notorious boy of the wild  
Adopted by the wolves  
When he was a child.  
  
That's why God  
That's why God  
That's why God made the movies

Slow down, you move too fast.  
You got to make the morning last.  
Just kicking down the cobble stones.  
Looking for fun and feelin' groovy.  
  
Hello lamppost, What cha knowing?  
I've come to watch your flowers growing.  
Ain't cha got no rhymes for me?  
Doot-in' doo-doo, Feelin' groovy.  
  
Got no deeds to do, No promises to keep.  
I'm dappled and drowsy and ready to sleep.  
Let the morning time drop all it's petals on me.  
Life, I love you, All is groovy.

After I died, and the makeup had dried  
I went back to my place  
No moon that night  
But a heavenly light shone on my face  
  
Still I thought it was odd  
There was no sign of God just to usher me in  
Then a voice from above  
Sugar coated with love, said, "Let us begin"  
  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
  
Okay, a new kid in school  
Got to follow the rule  
You got to learn the routine  
Woah, there's a girl over there  
With the sunshiny hair, like a homecomin' queen  
  
I said, "Hey, what you say?  
It's a glorious day,  
By the way how long you been dead?"  
Maybe you, maybe me  
Maybe baby makes three  
But she just shook her head  
  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
  
Buddah and Moses and all the noses from narrow to flat  
Had to stand in the line  
Just to glimpse the divine  
What you think about that?  
  
Well it seems like our fate to suffer  
And wait for the knowledge we seek  
It's all his design, no one cuts in the line  
No one here, likes a sneak  
  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
You got to fill out a form first  
And then you wait in the line  
  
After you climb, up the ladder of time  
The Lord God is here  
Face to face, in the vastness of space  
Your words disappear  
  
And you feel like swimming in an ocean of love,  
And the current is strong  
But all that remains when you  
Try to explain is a fragment of song  
  
Lord is it, be bop a lu la  
Or ooh poppa do  
Lord, be bop a lu la or ooh poppa do  
Be bop a lu la

It was a slow day  
And the sun was beating  
On the soldiers by the side of the road  
There was a bright light  
A shattering of shop windows  
The bomb in the baby carriage  
Was wired to the radio  
  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all  
  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby, don't cry  
Don't cry  
  
It was a dry wind  
And it swept across the desert  
And it curled into the circle of birth  
And the dead sand  
Falling on the children  
The mothers and the fathers  
And the automatic earth  
  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby, don't cry  
Don't cry  
  
It's a turn-around jump shot  
It's everybody jump start  
It's every generation throws a hero up the pop charts  
Medicine is magical and magical is art  
The boy in the bubble  
And the baby with the baboon heart  
  
And I believe  
These are the days of lasers in the jungle  
Lasers in the jungle somewhere  
Staccato signals of constant information  
A loose affiliation of millionaires  
And billionaires and baby  
  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
This is the long distance call  
The way the camera follows us in slo-mo  
The way we look to us all, oh yeah  
  
The way we look to a distant constellation  
That's dying in a corner of the sky  
These are the days of miracle and wonder  
And don't cry baby, don't cry  
Don't cry, don't cry

A family of musicians took shelter for the night  
In the little harbor church of St. Cecilia  
Two guitars, bata, bass drum and tambourine  
Rose of Jericho and Bougainvillea  
  
This is a lonely life  
Sorrows everywhere you turn  
And that's worth something  
When you think about it  
That's worth some money  
That's worth something  
When you think about it  
That is worth some money  
  
A trip to the market  
A trip into the pearl gray morning sunlight  
Settling over Washington  
A trip to the market  
A trip around the world  
Where the evening meal  
Is negotiable, if there is one.  
  
This is a lonely life  
Sorrows everywhere you turn  
And that's worth something  
When you think about it  
That's worth some money  
That's worth something  
When you think about it  
That is worth some money  
  
To prove that I love you  
Because I believe in you  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
If I have money  
If I have children  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah Doo-wop a Doo-wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah Doo-wop a Doo-wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
  
We are standing in the sunlight  
The early morning sunlight  
In the harbor church of St. Cecilia  
To praise a soul's returning to the earth  
To the rose of Jericho and the Bougainvillea  
  
To prove that I love you  
Because I believe in you  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
If I have money  
If I have children  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
  
If I have weaknesses  
Don't let them blind me now  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah  
Summer skies, stars are falling  
Leaving the shadow of the valley behind me now  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah  
Summer skies and stars are falling  
All along the injured coast  
Oh-wah oh-wah  
Doo Wop a Doo Wah

Moves like a fist through traffic  
Anger and no one can heal it  
Shoves a little bump into the momentum  
It's just a little lump  
But you feel it  
In the creases and the shadows  
With a rattling deep emotion  
The cool, cool river  
Sweeps the wild, white ocean  
  
Yes Boss. The government handshake  
Yes Boss. The crusher of language  
Yes Boss. Mr. Stillwater,  
The face at the edge of the banquet  
The cool, the cool river  
The cool, the cool river  
  
I believe in the future  
I may live in my car  
My radio tuned to  
The voice of a star  
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn  
Lightning pushes the edge of a thunderstorm  
And these old hopes and fears  
Still at my side  
  
Anger and no one can heal it  
Slides through the metal detector  
Lives like a mole in a motel  
A slide in a slide projector  
The cool, cool river  
Sweeps the wild, white ocean  
The rage of love turns inward  
To prayers of devotion  
And these prayers are  
The constant road across the wilderness  
These prayers are  
These prayers are the memory of God  
The memory of God  
  
And I believe in the future  
We shall suffer no more  
Maybe not in my lifetime  
But in yours I feel sure  
Song dogs barking at the break of dawn  
Lightning pushes the edges of a thunderstorm  
And these streets  
Quiet as a sleeping army  
Send their battered dreams to heaven, to heaven  
For the mother's restless son  
Who is a witness to, who is a warrior  
Who denies his urge to break and run  
  
Who says: Hard times?  
I'm used to them  
The speeding planet burns  
I'm used to that  
My life's so common it disappears  
And sometimes even music  
Cannot substitute for tears

It's a still life water color,  
Of a now late afternoon,  
As the sun shines through the curtained lace  
And shadows wash the room.  
And we sit and drink our coffee  
Couched in our indifference,  
Like shells upon the shore  
You can hear the ocean roar  
In The Dangling Conversation  
And the superficial sighs,  
The borders of our lives.  
  
And you read your Emily Dickinson,  
And I my Robert Frost,  
And we note our place with bookmarkers  
That measure what we've lost.  
Like a poem poorly written  
We are verses out of rhythm,  
Couplets out of rhyme,  
In syncopated time  
And The Dangling Conversation  
And the superficial sighs  
Are the borders of our lives.  
  
Yes we speak of things that matter,  
With words that must be said,  
"Can analysis be worthwhile?"  
"Is the theater really dead?"  
And how the room is softly faded  
And I only kiss your shadow,  
I cannot feel your hand,  
You're a stranger now unto me  
Lost in The Dangling Conversation  
And the superficial sighs  
In the borders of our lives.

When the last eagle flies  
Over the last crumbling mountain  
And the last lion roars  
At the last dusty fountain  
In the shadow of the forest  
Though she may be old and worn  
They will stare unbelieving  
At the Last Unicorn  
When the first breath of winter  
Throught the flowers is icing  
And you look to the north  
And a pale moon is rising  
And it seems like all is dying  
And would leave the world to mourn  
In the distance hear her laughter  
It's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive....... I'm alive  
When the last moon is cast  
Over the last star of morning  
And the future has past  
Without even a last desparate warning  
Then look into the sky where through  
The cloudes a path is formed  
Look and see her how she sparkles  
It's the Last Unicorn  
I'm alive... I'm alive.

I was reading a magazine  
And thinking of a rock and roll song  
The year was 1954  
And I hadn't been playing that long  
  
When a man came on the radio  
And this is what he said  
He said I hate to break it to his fans  
But Johnny Ace is dead, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Well, I really wasn't  
Such a Johnny Ace fan  
But I felt bad all the same  
So I sent away for his photograph  
  
And I waited till it came  
It came all the way from Texas  
With a sad and simple face  
And they signed it on the bottom  
From the Late Great Johnny Ace, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
It was the year of The Beatles  
It was the year of The Stones  
It was nineteen 1964  
I was living in London  
With the girl from the summer before  
  
It was the year of The Beatles  
It was the year of The Stones  
A year after J.F.K.  
We were staying up all night  
  
And giving the days away  
And the music was flowing amazing  
And blowing my way  
  
On a cold December evening  
I was walking through the Christmas tide  
When a stranger came up and asked me  
If I'd heard John Lennon had died  
  
And the two of us went to this bar  
And we stayed to close the place  
And every song we played  
Was for The Late Great Johnny Ace, yeah, yeah, yeah

I'm accustomed to a smooth ride  
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite  
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more  
I don't expect to sleep through the night  
Some people say a lie's a lie's a lie  
But I say why  
Why deny the obvious child?  
Why deny the obvious child?  
  
And in remembering a road sign  
I am remembering a girl when I was young  
And we said these songs are true  
These days are ours  
These tears are free  
And hey  
The cross is in the ballpark  
The cross is in the ballpark  
  
We had a lot of fun  
We had a lot of money  
We had a little son and we thought we'd call him Sonny  
Sonny gets married and moves away  
Sonny has a baby and bills to pay  
Sonny gets sunnier  
Day by day by day by day  
  
I've been waking up at sunrise  
I've been following the light across my room  
I watch the night receive the room of my day  
Some people say the sky is just the sky  
But I say  
Why deny the obvious child?  
Why deny the obvious child?  
  
Sonny sits by the window and thinks to himself  
How it's strange that some roots are like cages  
Sonny's yearbook from high school  
Is down on the shelf  
And he idle thumbs through the pages  
Some have died  
Some have fled from themselves  
Or struggled from here to get there  
Sonny wanders beyond his interior walls  
Runs his hands through his thinning brown hair  
I'm accustomed to a smoother ride  
Or maybe I'm a dog who's lost its bite  
I don't expect to be treated like a fool no more  
I don't expect to sleep the night  
Some people say a lie is just a lie  
But I say  
The cross is in the ballpark  
Why deny the obvious child?

Tom, get your plane right on time.  
I know your part'll go fine.  
Fly down to Mexico.  
Da-n-da-da-n-da-n-da-da and here I am,  
The only living boy in New York.  
I get the news I need on the weather report.  
I can gather all the news I need on the weather report.  
Hey, I've got nothing to do today but smile.  
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da here I am  
The only living boy in New York  
  
Half of the time we're gone but we don't know where,  
And we don't know here.  
  
Tom, get your plane right on time.  
I know you've been eager to fly now.  
Hey let your honesty shine, shine, shine  
Da-n-da-da-n-da-da-n-da-da  
Like it shines on me  
The only living boy in New York,  
The only living boy in New York.

On the side of a hill in a land called 'Somewhere'  
A little boy lies asleep in the earth  
While down in the valley a cruel war rages  
And people forget what a child's life is worth  
  
On the side of a hill, a little cloud weeps  
And waters the grave with its silent tears  
While a soldier cleans and polishes a gun  
That ended a life at the age of seven years  
  
And the war rages on in the land called 'Somewhere'  
And generals order their men to kill  
And to fight for a cause they've long ago forgotten  
While the little cloud weeps on the side of a hill

The sun is burning in the sky  
Strands of clouds go slowly drifting by  
In the park the lazy breeze  
Are joining in the flowers, among the trees  
And the sun burns in the sky  
  
Now the sun is in the West  
Little kids go home to take their rest  
And the couples in the park  
Are holdin' hands and waitin' for the dark  
And the sun is in the West  
  
Now the sun is sinking low  
Children playin' know it's time to go  
High above a spot appears  
A little blossom blooms and then draws near  
And the sun is sinking low  
  
Now the sun has come to Earth  
Shrouded in a mushroom cloud of death  
Death comes in a blinding flash  
Of hellish heat and leaves a smear of ash  
And the sun has come to Earth  
  
Now the sun has disappeared  
All is darkness, anger, pain and fear  
Twisted, sightless wrecks of men  
Go groping on their knees and cry in pain  
And the sun has disappeared

There once was a teacher of great renown  
Whose words were like the tablets of stone  
Because it's easier to learn than unlearn  
Because we've passed the point of no return  
Gather your goods and follow me  
Or you will surely die  
  
I was only a child of the city  
My parents were children of immigrant stock  
So we followed as followers go  
Over a mountain with a napkin of snow  
And ate the berries and roots  
That grow along the timberline  
Deeper and deeper the dreamer of love  
Sleeps on a quilt of stars  
  
It's cold  
Sometimes you can't catch your breath  
It's cold  
  
Time and abundance thickened his step  
So the teacher divided in two  
One half ate the forests and fields  
The other half sucked all the moisture from the clouds  
And we, we were amazed at the power of his appetite  
  
Deeper and deeper the dreamer of love  
Sleeps on a quilt of stars  
  
Sometimes we don't know who we are  
Sometimes force overpowers us and we cry  
My teacher carry me home  
Carry me home my teacher  
Carry me home  
Carry me home my teacher  
Carry me home

Come gather 'round people  
Wherever you roam  
And admit that the waters  
Around you have grown  
And accept it that soon  
You'll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin'  
Then you better start swimmin'  
Or you'll sink like a stone  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come writers and critics  
Who prophesize with your pen  
And keep your eyes wide  
The chance won't come again  
And don't speak too soon  
For the wheel's still in spin  
And there's no tellin' who that it's namin'  
'Cause the loser now  
Will be later to win  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come senators, congressmen  
Please heed the call  
Don't stand in the doorways  
Don't block up the hall  
For he that gets hurt  
Will be he that has stalled  
The battle outside ragin'  
Will soon shake your windows  
And rattle your walls  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come mothers and fathers  
All over the land  
And don't criticize  
What you can't understand  
Your sons and your daughters  
Are beyond your command  
Your old road is rapidly agin'  
Please get out of the new one  
If you can't lend your hand  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
The line it is drawn  
The curse it is cast  
The slow one now  
Will later be fast  
And the present now  
Will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin'  
The first one now  
Will later be last  
For the times they are a-changin'  
For the times they are a-changin'

If you got the balls then come on me te mano  
If you got the balls then come on me te mano  
  
Frenchie cordero goes down to hells kitchen  
To sell the irish some weed  
Well this patty boy's mama was on the stoop  
Starts bitching about spics is a mongo breed  
Now here comes her son, he looks like a ton  
Of cornbeef floating in beer, and he says...  
Fucking puerto rican dope dealing punk  
Get your shit brown ass out of here yeah  
  
He says fucking puerto rican dope dealing punk  
Get your shit brown ass out of here yeah  
  
Well these shanty town irish beat his ass good  
And fractured his collar bone  
Conio, all I was thinking, what home of the brave?  
It's a fucking war zone  
  
If you got the balls then come on me te mano  
If you got cohones come on me te mano  
If you got the balls then come on me te mano  
If you got cohones come on me te mano

If a baby is born and no one complains  
Then that's good luck, runnin' through young veins  
And if life is a blessing  
That brushes the tops of the trees  
Well it's a short walk, in a sweet breeze  
  
I will need you, feed you,  
Seed you, plead with you  
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma  
  
If the heart is an open memory book  
That was the chance I took  
The more I searched  
The more I shook for Thelma  
  
Last night I slept on a rented pillow  
A silver moon above my head  
A thirsty dreamless sleep released me  
And I reached for the phone by the side of the bed  
  
Now the first time that I saw you I thought  
She's beautiful, but she's too young to be caught  
People aware of my history  
Trying to steer you away from me  
I left a message at your hotel  
Don't let management poison the well  
  
I will need you, feed you,  
Seed you, plead with you  
All for a taste of your sweet love, Thelma  
  
The phone is ringing and I realize  
We are time zones and oceans apart  
The words I speak in the middle of my night  
Fall on your yesterday's heart  
  
If the sun don't shine  
If the wind don't break  
If the clock don't jump off the wall  
Thelma, my darlin', I will cushion your fall  
  
I will need you, feed you,  
Seed you, plead with you  
Without the taste of your sweet love, Thelma  
I am only a man who skirted the edge of despair  
For a long time, now  
And I don't care  
  
I watch you sleeping in the hospital bed  
The baby curled up in a ball  
Winter sunlight hits the family tree  
And everything else becomes nothing at all

I've got a wife and four grown children  
I can't afford their education  
I've been a prison guard for fourteen years  
That ain't exactly a vacation  
Since he's been here he's followed ev'ry rule and I  
Told you my position  
The law says he's got the right to go to school  
We abide by the court's decision  
  
I got a Winchester two forty three  
I like that gun for deer  
  
Upstate November and the air is free  
Feels like hunting seasons here  
He's the one to keep your eye on  
He's a sneak yeah but he's quiet  
He's a trouble maker if I ever seen one  
Next thing ya know it's Attica  
And we got a prison riot  
  
There ain't no way that punk gets his degree  
And hides behind the constitution  
No way in hell that smart assed spic goes free  
Not while I'm in this institution

Prayers offered in times of peace are silent conversations,  
Appeals for love or love's release  
In private invocations  
But all that is changed now,  
Gone like a memory from the day before the fires.  
People hungry for the voice of God  
Hear lunatics and liars  
Wartime prayers, wartime prayers  
In every language spoken,  
For every family scattered and broken.  
  
Because you cannot walk with the holy,  
If you're just a halfway decent man.  
I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind  
With a genius marketing plan.  
I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,  
Even a little drop will do.  
I want to rid my heart of envy  
And cleanse my soul of rage  
Before I'm through.  
  
Times are hard, it's a hard time  
But everybody knows all about hard times.  
The thing is, what are you gonna do?  
Well, you cry and try to muscle through  
Try to rearrange your stuff  
But when the wounds are deep enough,  
It's all that we can bear,  
We wrap ourselves in prayer.  
  
Because you cannot walk with the holy,  
If you're just a halfway decent man.  
I don't pretend that I'm a mastermind  
With a genius marketing plan.  
I'm trying to tap into some wisdom,  
Even a little drop willdo.  
I want to rid my heart of envy  
And cleanse my soul of rage  
Before I'm through.  
A mother murmurs in twilight sleep  
And draws her babies closer.  
With hush-a-byes for sleepy eyes,  
And kisses on the shoulder.  
To drive away despair  
She says a wartime prayer

I can hear the soft breathing  
Of the girl that I love,  
As she lies here beside me  
Asleep with the night,  
And her hair, in a fine mist  
Floats on my pillow,  
Reflecting the glow  
Of the winter moonlight.  
She is soft, she is warm,  
But my heart remains heavy,  
And I watch as her breasts  
Gently rise, gently fall,  
For I know with the first light of dawn  
I'll be leaving,  
And tonight will be  
All I have left to recall.  
Oh, what have I done,  
Why have I done it,  
I've committed a crime,  
I've broken the law.  
For twenty-five dollars  
And pieces of silver,  
I held up and robbed  
A hard liquor store.  
My life seems unreal,  
My crime an illusion,  
A scene badly written  
In which I must play.  
Yet I know as I gaze  
At my young love beside me,  
The morning is just a few hours away.
