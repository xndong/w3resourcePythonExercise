Walking down 5th Avenue  
I saw him walking there with you  
People see and people talk  
Word travels fast round my block  
Might just save you the price of writing  
I could save you an hour or two  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Don't know what to ask of you  
My mind is gettin' so confused  
Even when I really try  
Keeps sounding like I'm saying goodbye  
Somewhere deep in my heart I'm hurtin'  
'Cause I keep on remembering you  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Such a long way to go  
How many times must I look up and say  
What kind of fool am I  
But I can't turn my back on the times that we shared  
No matter how I try  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Can't seem to shake the thought of you  
Even in the dark of night  
Your memories of shining light  
Though I'm tryin' to change direction  
I pray what I saw ain't true  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Walking down 5th Avenue  
Such a long way to go  
Do, do, do, do ...  

As the snow is gently falling, hang the mistletoe you said  
A Christmas to remember lay ahead  
Don't forget to mail the packages and the cards there in the hall  
Remember last year's tree was just too small  
  
It's time again to pull out all the ornaments, the train  
The kitchen towels with Santa, the lights and candy cane  
Inside each box of treasure from the Christmas that's gone by  
And each one will remind us how they fly  
  
Please remember (please remember)  
Please remember (please remember)  
All the Christmases gone by  
Please remember (please remember)  
Please remember (please remember)  
All those Christmases gone by  
  
In the kitchen you make cookies, taste the sugar star you said  
The Christmas to remember lay ahead  
Should we put out all the reindeer or just Rudolph standing tall  
It was you who had to have him at the mall  
  
It's time again to pull out all the ornaments, the train  
The kitchen towels with Santa, the lights and candy cane  
Inside each box of treasure from the Christmas that's gone by  
And each one will remind us how they fly  
  
Please remember (please remember)  
Please remember (please remember)  
All the Christmases gone by  
Please remember (please remember)  
Please remember (please remember)  
All those Christmases gone by  
  
Oh please remember (please remember)  
Please remember (please remember)  
All the Christmases gone by  
Please remember (please remember)  
Please remember (please remember)  
All the Christmases gone by

I look to the east when the day  
Is done and think of it all  
All the thoughts that I've seen of  
Satin seams and tide pool dreams  
I look to the sun  
As the day is dawning  
I carry my dreams  
From a moment before  
I try to recall  
But I find myself yawning  
I guess they are gone but there's more  
So I head out the door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
First break in the day if the time  
Is right and nobody minds  
I stroll down the lane take a breath  
Of air and drift on a dream  
I look to the sun  
As the day is warming  
Consider the things  
That have happened before  
I feel like I'm one  
With the wind on the hillside  
I feel like I'm one with the  
River that runs by my door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
I look to the sun  
As the day is dawning  
I carry my dreams  
From a moment before  
I feel like I'm one  
With the wind on the hillside  
I feel like I'm one with the  
River that runs by my door  
  
All around, listen and you can  
Hear the sound  
On cloudy days seems like I  
Always feel this way  
  
(repeat and fade)

I rise to see you in the morning  
I feel your warmth so true  
The light inside of me  
Is there for all to see  
But all I think about is you  
  
I see your face in every doorway  
That I have wandered through  
The light inside of me  
Is there for all to see  
But all I think about is you  
  
Baby even in the hardest times  
Lately even in the darkest nights  
I know  
  
Baby even in the hardest times  
Lately even in the darkest nights  
I know  
  
I rise to see you in the morning  
I feel your warmth so true  
The light inside of me  
Is there for all to see  
But all I think about is you  
But all I think about is you

All my life, without a doubt I give you  
All my life, now and forever till the  
Day I die, you and I will share  
  
All the things this changing world can offer  
So I sing, I'd be happy just to  
Stay this way, spend each day, with you  
  
There was a time, that I just thought  
That I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
We started on our way  
I do recall that every moment spent  
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line  
  
I put the past away  
I put the past away  
I put the past away  
  
All my life, I will carry you through  
All my life, between each hour of the passing days  
I will stay with you  
  
There was a time, that I just thought  
That I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
We started on our way  
I do recall that every moment spent  
Was wasted time then I chose to lay it on the line  
  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
I wanted this all my life

When the day breaks  
Something begins  
When your heart aches  
Do you give in?  
I heard that you were lonely  
One careful look shows you're lonely  
All night you'll fight  
With your mind, with your mind  
After lights out, don't make a sound  
Apple blossoms, come fallin' down  
Black and white sun shining brightly  
Shelter your eyes, hold on tightly  
All night you'll fight  
With your mind, with your mind  
Love thy neighbor  
You will understand  
Coffee flavor, yours or any brand  
I heard that you were lonely  
Nothing is real when you're lonely  
All night you'll fight  
With your mind, with your mind  

(Matthew Caws, Ira Elliott and Daniel Lorca)  
  
To make a mountain of your life  
Is just a choice  
But I never learned enough  
To listen to the voice that told me..  
Always love... Hate will get you every time  
Always love... Don't wait till the finish line  
  
Slow demands come 'round  
Squeeze the air and keep the rest out  
It helps to write it down  
Even when you then cross it out  
  
Always love... Hate will get you every time  
Always love... Even when you are defied  
  
Self-directed lies  
I want to know what it'd be like to  
Aim so high above  
Any card that you get dealt you...  
  
Always love... Hate will get you every time  
Always love... Hate will get you  
  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs,  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs  
You said...  
Hey, you good ones  
Hey, you good ones  
  
To make a mountain of your life  
Is just a choice  
But I never learned enough  
To listen to the voice that told me  
Always love... hate will get you every time  
Always love... hate will get you:  
  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs,  
I've been held back by something  
Yeah, you said to me quietly on the stairs  
You said . . .  
Hey, you good ones  
Hey, you good ones  
Hey, you good ones  
I...

Amber cascades all over today  
Then we walk on a crooked catwalk  
Only to be delayed  
Bubbles of blue burst into two  
Eaten up by the incoming tide  
Of the new  
  
Then we call to the man who walks on the water  
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view  
It's in view  
  
Granite charades are played in the rain  
  
  
  
CLICK ABOVE TO VISIT OUR SPONSORS  
  
Till we fall through a sand castle window  
To avoid the pain  
Summer canoe paddles up to you  
'cause it's time for another beer run  
Or something that's equally true  
  
Then we call to the man who walks on the water  
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view  
  
Then we call to the man who walks on the water  
We talk of a plan to stop all the slaughter in view  
It's in view

I remember sidewalk laughter down New Orleans, LA  
A hot wet night at the fight with you  
Had to push through the crowds and talk  
Very loud it's true  
But you were on my mind that day  
You were on my mind each day  
You were on my mind that day and forever  
Had a drink, stop to think we had a few  
Afterwards we went down to the dance side of town for the view  
You went blushing inside and you pinched me to see  
If I knew  
But you were on my mind that day  
You were on my mind each day  
You were on my mind that day and forever, and forever  
We were lovers then and forever  
There was nothing that we couldn't do  
A hot wet night at the fight with you  
Times like that weekend remain in my heart crystal clear  
Walking along to the song you have helped me to hear  
Yes you were on my mind that day  
You were on my mind each day  
You were on my mind that day and forever, and forever  

Hey, daddy just lost his pay  
What did he do it for  
It never made it through our door  
He drank the whole week away  
And what can a family say  
There must be a better way  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try  
  
Pick up the telephone  
Tell him you want him home  
To sit and watch the evenings pass  
And readin' the leaves of grass  
  
I'm caught in a closing door  
It's pinning me to the floor  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try  
  
I'm caught in a closing door  
It's pinning me to the floor  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try  
  
When we're old and gray  
And the things we say are the things we really mean  
So why cause a scene  
When things ain't what they seem  
'cause the end result's the same  
Now what can a family say  
There must be a better way  
Now mama don't start to cry  
Let's give him another try

The day we lost our voice with little choice, I can't explain  
An act of agony  
And someone told me too that it's true when you call aloud  
It's only destiny  
Or is it mystery  
But then we came around and sang our song and acted proud  
And posed for memory  
  
We made a cry to the underground  
Are you there  
I looked and saw that they were still around  
But do you care  
  
I drank a little bit, so underlit to see it now  
The show was never seen  
And all the time I lost is never lost  
It's only thumbing through eternity  
  
We made a cry to the underground  
Are you there  
I looked and saw that they were still around  
But do you care  
  
Who are you going to see  
What are you going to be  
  
You made a cry to the underground  
Are you there  
I looked and saw that they were still around  
But do you care  
  
Are you there (are you there)  
Are you there (are you there)  
Are you there (are you there)  
Are you there (are you there)  
Are you there (are you there)  
Are you there (are you there) ...

Time to make a change  
Time to rearrange  
Sooner or later  
It's somethin' you gotta do  
  
Baby it's up to you  
What are you gonna do  
Lately it's up to you  
Who's gonna help you through  
  
Every now and then  
Trying to pretend  
I don't want to see you  
Sorry but that ain't true  
  
Baby it's up to you  
What are you gonna do  
Lately it's up to you  
Who's gonna see you through  
  
Every now and then  
Trying to pretend  
I don't want to see you  
Sorry but that ain't true  
  
Baby it's up to you  
What are you gonna do  
Lately it's up to you  
What are you gonna do  
  
Baby it's up to you (Baby it's up to you)  
Baby it's up to you (Baby it's up to you)  
Baby it's up to you  
Who's gonna help you through

All the leaves are brown  
And the sky is gray  
I went for a walk  
On a winter's day  
I'd be safe and warm  
If I was in L.A.  
California dreamin'  
On such a winter's day  
I stopped into a church  
(Stopped into a church)  
I passed along the way  
(Passed along the way)  
You know, I got down on my knees  
(Got down on my knees)  
And I pretend to pray  
(I pretend to pray)  
Oh, the preacher likes the cold  
(Preacher likes the cold)  
He knows I'm gonna stay  
(Knows I'm gonna stay)  
Oh, California dreamin'  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
All the leaves are brown  
(The leaves are brown)  
And the sky is gray  
(And the sky is gray)  
I went for a walk  
(I went for a walk)  
On a winter's day  
(On a winter's day)  
If I didn't tell her  
(If I didn't tell her)  
I could leave today  
(I could leave today)  
Oh, California dreamin'  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  
(California dreamin')  
On such a winter's day  

Heaven may be an answer  
If you're lookin' for Eden in the sky  
On your waters I see a strange reflection  
Rumor has it I'll see you when I die  
Everyone I meet is from California  
There's dancin' in the streets in California  
In California you watch the shadow dancer  
Floating gently, gently on the sea  
In California you're such a strange romancer  
Come and see me when the world has set you free  
Everyone I meet is from California  
There's dancin' in the streets in California  
Everyone I meet is from California  
There's dancin' in the streets in California

Come save me  
From things I shouldn't do  
I need you  
Every word is true  
No answer  
At numbers I have dialed  
I hear the call of the wild  
Nights are forever  
The days linger on  
Standing in silence  
Time lasts so long  
Through all my efforts  
I act like a child  
Hearin' the call of the wild  
Come save me  
From things I shouldn't know  
I'm wearin'  
Someone else's clothes  
I needed  
Singing like a child  
I hear the call of the wild  
Casting my mind back  
Some things don't seem right  
An image of angels  
Appears in the night  
As I awoke  
I could swear that they smiled  
Hearin' the call of the wild  
Come save me  
From things I shouldn't do  
I need you  
Every word is true  
No answer  
At numbers I have dialed  
I hear the call of the wild  
I hear the call of the wild  
Now, hear the call of the wild  
Come save me  
From things I shouldn't do  
I need you  
Every word is true  
No answer  
At numbers I have dialed  
I hear the call of the wild  
I hear the call of the wild  
I hear the call of the wild  

I drive to the coastline  
Looking for visual pleasures to catch my eye  
The sun turns around hits me on the shoulder  
I fly away  
Due to the situation this morning  
All in the world's OK  
I head down Sunset north to Santa Barbara  
We sail away  
I could live in the walls of a prison  
Where the warm summer winds would never blow  
Then again, think of what I'd be missing (as to the other side)  
And how some do it I'll never know, I'll never know  
I must have spent a lifetime as a sailor  
Sailin' the ocean blue  
But every single waterway leads to you  
To you  
I could live in the walls of a prison  
Where the warm summer winds would never blow  
Then again, think of what I'd be missing (as to the other side)  
And how some do it I'll never know, I'll never know  
I'm headin' out over an ocean of blue  
The trailin' wake far behind  
Won't turn me down  
And it won't turn me around  
I could live in the walls of a prison  
Where the warm summer winds would never blow  
Then again, think of what I'd be missing (as to the other side)  
And how some do it I'll never know, I'll never know  

Coming in from London from over the pole  
Flying in a big airliner  
Chicken flying everywhere around the plane  
Could we ever feel much finer  
  
Coming into Los Angeles  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
There's a guy with a ticket to Mexico  
Could he ever look much stranger  
Walking in the hall with his things and all  
Smiling, said he was the Lone Ranger  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
Hip woman walking on a moving floor  
Tripping on the escalator  
There's a man in the line, and she's blowing his mind  
Thinking that he's already made her  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man  
  
Coming into Los Angeles,  
Bringing in a couple of keys  
Don't touch my bags if you please  
Mister Customs man, man

I've been down to the water  
I've been on top of the world  
Somebody should come and see me  
Somebody should give me the word  
  
'Cause I don't know how many more  
I don't know how many more  
I don't know how many more to see  
  
Sometimes the free thoughts clash  
Sometimes I see through the grass  
Sometime the light begins to dim  
Somebody should come and be me  
Somebody should come and free me  
  
'Cause I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more to see  
  
Oh darlin', darlin', I always want to see you  
Oh darlin', darlin', I always want to see you  
  
I cannot learn much more life  
I cannot see much more  
Somebody should stop the new sight  
Somebody should close the door  
  
'Cause I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more (many more)  
I don't know how many more to see  
  
Wrapped in a blanket, lyin' in the snow  
Feelin' like the men felt a long time ago  
Goin' to find me a home, goin' to build it with my hands  
Can't you see there's food to be grown  
Got to dig up, dig up the land

Flyin' me back to Memphis  
Gotta find my Daisy Jane  
Well the summer's gonne  
And I hope she's feelin' the same  
Well I left her just to roam the city  
Thinkin' it would easy the pain  
I'm a crazy man and I'm playin' my crazy game, game  
Does she really love me I think she does  
Like the star above me I know  
Because when the sky is bright  
Everything's all right  
  
Flyin' me back to Memphis  
Honey keep the oven warm  
All the clouds are clearin'  
And I think we're over the storm  
Well I been pickin' it up around me  
Daisy I think I'm sane  
Well I'm awful glad  
And I guess you're really to blame, blame  
Do you really love me  
I hope you do  
Like the stars above me how I love you  
When it's cold at night  
Everything's all right

There's a little girl out lyin' on her own  
She's got a broken heart  
She's not the kind to take you down for long  
She knows and plays it smart  
  
(Ah) And if she's comin' she's showed no mark  
She's heard no whistle blowin' from the dark  
She feels like leavin' and she don't know why  
Without no bridges she's trapped, so I sigh  
  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't try denyin' livin' on the other side  
All your life  
You were on your own  
  
If you want you can ride my train  
And soon forget the reason that you're leaving  
You'll lose yourself and then sometime  
Maybe even save yourself some grievin'  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't try denyin' livin' on the other side  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't try denyin' livin' on the other side  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide  
Don't cross the river if you can't swim the tide ...

Here we are again  
Two lovers lost in a maze  
So many roads we could go down  
So many ways we could go wrong  
  
You think we should part  
Both go our own separate ways  
Oh, girl why can't (oo) we work it out  
Can't you hear what my heart says (ah)  
  
Don't let me be lonely  
Don't let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldn't be right  
Now that i (ah) need you more than ever  
  
Here we are tonight  
Both starring in the same play  
But i'm the one (oo) who plays the fool  
I've only one line to say (ah)  
  
Don't let me be lonely  
Don't let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldn't be right  
Now that i (ah) need you more than ever  
  
Girl, what will i be  
If you walk away from me  
How can i make you stay (ah)  
  
Don't let me be lonely  
Don't let me be lonely tonight  
That wouldn't be right  
Now that i need you more than ever

Early in the morning  
About the break of day  
The earlybird is working  
So his life don't fade away  
Spends his life denying that  
He's got no time for flying  
In the breeze  
High up on his own, the eagle flies alone  
And he is free  
Earlybird is scratching though  
The going's getting tough  
Time is passing by him and he just  
Can't get enough  
He'll tell you all is well when  
All is really going wrong  
The earlybird will wake one day  
And find his life is gone  
You know I like to lay in bed  
And sleep out in the sun  
Reading books and playing crazy music  
Just for fun  
You know it makes feel so fine  
And puts my mind at ease to  
Know that I don't harm a soul  
In doing what I please  
Aaahhhh, ahhhh , ahhhhh ahhh.....  
Any old day you say,  
Ain't gonna fade away  
Any old day you say,  
Ain't gonna fade away

I was falling for some time  
Passing others, as they'd climb  
In a moment very clear  
You seemed to beckon, come here dear  
  
Emma, sure as the sun's shining on you  
I can tell I'm in your spell  
Emma you're the one, oh  
  
If they ever change your mind  
Try to leave it all behind  
If there ever comes a time  
You go your way, and I'll go mine  
  
Emma, sure as the moon circles over  
Heaven knows, that's how it goes  
Emma you're the one, oh  
  
I can tell I'm in your spell  
Emma, you're the one, oh  
Emma, Emma, Emma...

Written by dewey bunnell and bill mumy, (C)1984  
Found on perspective.  
Each time I call you I feel my heart beat  
I want to be there walkin' up your street  
It doesn't matter how far I travel  
Crossin' the ocean, the golden gravel  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you  
Tomorrow's headline, read all about it  
They caught the big one and I don't doubt it  
Across the country they're paintin' stories  
About our failures, about our glories  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you  
All of those screams of each other must share in the fight  
Nobody knows where their clear spirit goes in the night  
Out of the country it seems so easy  
To keep believin' our dream of fiji  
Your image lingers, a faded picture  
Your past erased by untold elixir  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you  
All of those screams of each other must share in the fight  
Nobody knows where their clear spirit goes in the night  
I'm fallin' off the world  
I'm callin' you (do you believe)  
I'm fallin' off the world  

I've seen the Ides of March  
And I've seen the fall of Rome  
I've seen all kinds of stuff  
But I never see my home  
If my life-line is  
These million miles of track  
One thing I know by now  
There is no turning back  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
From a moving train  
If every venture was  
A path to no avail  
I'd still be rolling down  
This never ending trail  
If we had a destination  
In our sights  
We would be helpless as  
We passed it in the night  
From a moving train (hear the engine running)  
From a moving train (you can get on board)  
From a moving train (hear the motor humming)  
From a moving train (see, you've gotta see the light)  
And if by chance you find a woman  
That you might love along the way  
You better hold her tight  
Tell her everything's alright  
Or she might jump along the way  
From a moving train (hear the engine running)  
From a moving train (you can get on board)  
From a moving train (hear the motor humming)  
From a moving train (see, you've gotta see the light)  
From a moving train (hear the engine running)  
From a moving train (you can get on board)  
From a moving train (hear the motor humming)  
From a moving train (see, you've gotta see the light)  

Frosty the snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn-cob pipe  
And a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
Frosty the snowman  
Is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
Frosty the snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "Let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away"  
Down to the village  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying, "Catch me if you can"  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
He only paused a moment when  
He heard them holler, stop  
Frosty the snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying, "Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day"  
(Frosty)  
Yes, he waved goodbye  
Saying, "Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day"  

When the deep blue night is running close on your track  
And you can feel the green monkey crawlin' across your back  
Don't take me so real that you forget how to feel  
Don't let the threat of the dagger turn your heart into steel  
  
[Chorus]  
Smell the perfume of the silent dream  
Fly the ocean, read a story to me  
Speak the wisdom of a redwood tree  
Speak to me  
  
So you think that star cluster shining bright in the sky  
Will speak the fate of your evening, tell the truth to your lie  
Don't let the features you read control the tickets you buy  
Soon as you learn that you live, you're just beginning to die  
  
[Chorus: x2]

In the greenhouse  
Among the flowers  
You would linger, linger there for hours  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
What were you thinking  
Was this the jungle?  
I felt the good earth, I felt the good earth rumble  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  
You were smiling  
The heat was rising  
The blood-red roses hypnotizing  
In the greenhouse  
You were waiting  
And the perfume was suffocating  
That's where I saw your face  
Your body dressed in lace  
Your secret hiding place  
In the greenhouse  

I'm only half a man  
When I'm not by your side  
I try to make a plan  
And I don't try to hide  
So come on over closer to me  
And everything will be just like it should be  
Why don't you help me  
Please don't stand on your pride  
I feel so empty  
Why don't you let me inside  
So come on over closer to me  
And everything will be just like it should be  
You (you, you, you)  
Set my soul on fire  
You (you, you, you)  
Fill me with desire  
When ever I'm near you  
I'm only half a man  
When I'm not by your side  
I try to make a plan  
And I don't try to hide  
So come on over closer to me  
And everything will be just like it should be  

Who's that knockin' on my door this mornin'  
Can't they see I'm dead  
There ain't nothin' left to do this mornin'  
'Cept to make it to my bed  
I was out till all hours  
Raisin' Cain once again  
I don't care about the hours  
Only how much did I spend  
'Cause I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
I started slow after sundown  
I tiptoed right up till ten  
Then after while I went downtown  
It was the beginning of my end  
Now I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
Oh, how am I gonna stake my claim on the future  
When I cannot lift my head  
Oh, I ain't nothin' but a drunken loser  
And my liver's overfed  
'Cause I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
'Cause I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
Now I got a hangover  
I won't make it through the day  
'Cause I got a hangover  
So just leave me where I lay  
So just leave me where I lay

You, can I make it known  
I'd like to take you home  
You been away so long  
I'd like to see you  
  
But when I saw you at the local hop  
I tried to take you but you made me stop  
Then I saw that you were dancing with a rent-a-cop  
Whoa, whoa!  
  
The minute you pulled me through  
You thought that then you knew  
If not today, I'd find a way  
To get to you  
  
Just a little of nothin'  
That's all you had the time to give  
Just a little of nothin'  
Ain't gonna make it worthwhile for me  
  
If you'd only have listened  
You'd have heard every word I said  
Just a little of nothin'  
Ain't gonna make it worthwhile for me  
  
Just a little of nothin' (just a little of nothin') [Repeat: x4]  
  
Newton-under-roseberry topping  
And it's cold and it's wet  
And you feel like you're part of all time  
  
Living in the gap between the echoes  
Feeling it hot  
And feeling it cold  
  
As long as there are fish in the sea  
Have a cup of tea  
Oh, as long as there are fish in the sea  
Have a cup of tea  
  
'cause you are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
You are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
You are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
You are running from the ring of the golden bell  
Like a bat out of hell  
  
There's a lady across the hall  
She's telling me it's all right (all right)  
I'm tryin' to give her my all  
She's sayin' I'm uptight  
Hell of a way to spend an afternoon  
  
Saw a movie tonight  
Got frightened and broke down (broke down)  
Got a call in the night  
My old lady just hit town  
Take her away, she's tryin' to turn me round  
I'm nowhere to be found  
  
I can't unread the pages I've already read  
And I can't feed these ages left in my head  
They're already dead, yeah

There's just no way to say how much I love you  
You never make me cry and that's just fine  
I've only got my fear to burn above me  
You know we all get scared from time to time  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child  
  
There's just no way to play the things I'm feelin'  
No way to tell you all the things you mean  
Every day I only feel like stealin'  
Away to where I know I can be free  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me when I'm wild  
  
Laying down the ways to say I need you  
Scared of lookin' tall and feeling small  
Running through the days I have beside you  
Scared of being wrong, and that's it all  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child  
  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me from the place it starts  
Love me with your head and heart  
Love me like a child

Drove through the valley on my way to the sea  
I was lookin' for the answer to what's botherin' me  
Sat there all day and I stared at the blue  
There's no denyin' I was thinkin' of you  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
I walked to the corner, watch the world go by  
Hands in my pockets and my head in the sky  
What does it matter now that everything is fine  
When I can't eat, sleep, or even walk a straight line  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
But it's hard, you make it hard, ah  
When I first met you I was barely alive  
Had no direction baby you had the drive  
We headed out on the wild open road  
Till we broke down from the weight of the load  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
I drove through the valley on my way to the sea  
And I was lookin' for the answer to what's botherin' me  
Sat there all day and I stared at the blue, wow  
There's no denyin' I was thinkin' of you, but  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  
Hell's on fire, heaven's freezin'  
And I love you baby without good reason  

Just like a person from another world  
My eyes can see inside you, little girl  
I see things that you don't want to see  
I see things you're trying to hide from me  
I'm just trying to make you understand  
All the ways you can affect this man  
From the moment that you came in touch  
With the power there to burn so much  
You've got hidden talent (yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
You know your past is what's been bugging you  
If you're ready girl ... do what you gotta do  
Look for your life between the lines  
Bad directions and poor designs  
You've got hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
Check it out you ... got it, hidden talent, oh  
With the advantage of perspective I  
See there's more to you than meets the eye  
But now the time must come to spread your wings and fly  
Yeah (hidden talent) yeah  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
Check it out ... you got it, hidden talent, oh  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
Affair without warning  
Hidden talent, mmm (mmm)  
Hidden talent (hidden talent, yeah)  
I bet you're gonna find some hidden talent, oh  
(fade)  

Orange and yellow and purple and green  
The lights of the city at night set the scene  
Stumble through the bars of forget-me-not lane  
Sparkle through the glitter but don't show the pain  
  
In Hollywood  
Underneath a golden palm tree  
Hollywood  
Come to the party the drinks are on me  
For free  
  
Heartbeats echo through a cavern of love  
Come to the tavern I'll meet you up above  
Soaring through the heavens, what a fabulous ride  
But everybody's heading for the same place to hide  
  
In Hollywood  
Underneath a golden palm tree  
Hollywood  
Come to the party the drinks are on me  
For free  
  
The drink's on me  
For free  
The drink's on me  
For free  
The drink's on me [Repeat: x4]

Honey, I wish you were here  
To brighten my lonely nights  
How long I've waited  
To hold you in my arms again  
  
Honey, you know I'm so scared  
Scared that you might not come back  
One day without you  
Is one day too long for me  
Wish you could see  
The love in the heart of me  
  
Honey, I really miss you  
Honey, I need to kiss you  
Honey, I want to hold you  
Honey, have I told you  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
  
Honey, you know you think like me  
Now I pray every day  
I'll do anything  
If there's a chance you'll stay  
  
Your perfume is still in my room  
Your pillow it's left where you lay  
Your picture is standing  
Inside the frame I made  
It seems so sad  
To lose the love we had  
  
Honey, I really miss you  
Honey, I need to kiss you  
Honey, I want to hold you  
Honey, have I told you  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
  
Honey, I've waited for only one line  
To let me know how you are  
I need to be with you  
I'd run to your side, however near or far  
Girl, I need you  
  
Honey, honey  
Honey, honey  
Honey, I really miss you  
Honey, I need to kiss you  
Honey, don't you know it  
Honey, don't I show it  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now  
I really need you now

Down in this hot town  
At some old cafe tonight  
You hear the dogs bay  
At the green neon light  
It's one hundred degrees  
But the heat is free  
In this hot town  
This hot town tonight  
And that there candle  
Only adds to the heat  
As you sit in your t-shirt  
Trying to eat  
You watch the waitress, you watch the clock on the wall  
And the flies in the window climb up just to fall  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
Down in this hot town  
Don't know no person to call  
And this here cafe  
Don't serve no beer at all  
Out on the sidewalk  
It's cooling down for your feet (cooling down, cooling down for your feet)  
But the women are still sweaty and sweet (still sweaty, sweaty and sweet)  
So you watch the waitress, you watch the clock on the wall  
And the flies in the window climb up just to fall  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
It's one hundred degrees  
But the heat is free  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
It's one hundred degrees (oh yeah)  
In this hot town (hot town, hot town)  
This hot town tonight (hot town, hot, hot)  
(Hot town, hot town)  
(Hot town, hot, hot)... (fade)  

There was a time I walked the earth  
As if I knew my way  
It seems the more I got around  
The less I had to say  
  
I built a world of tumbling dice  
Upon a field of sand  
And now the more I try to give  
The more that you demand  
So we wait, then discard, house of cards  
  
I took a pane of broken glass  
And made a diamond ring  
For every single blade of grass  
Mm, of thee I sing  
Why we wait, hesitate, I don't know  
  
Don't tell me 'bout your world coming apart  
Should have known about you girl, right from the start  
So we wait, to discard, house of cards  
  
I'm walking down a lonely road  
To the edge of town  
If you try and change my mind  
I won't turn around  
Tell me why I should try once again  
House of cards

How long must this go on  
How long must this go on  
  
I've been walking through my fields of green  
I've seen flowers, uh huh, that you've never seen  
Blue skies and birds flying high, in the desert  
Gee wiz, uh huh, yea, me oh my  
  
I said, how long must this go on  
How long must this go on  
  
How long must this go on  
How long must this go on

They tried to catch us dancin' on the line  
They say we took it way too far this time  
They gave us no breaks here  
But we made our own I swear  
  
I do, I do believe in you  
After all that we've been through  
I do, I do believe in you  
And everything that we do  
  
We used to run with the dangerous crowd  
Where the flame was hot and burnin' out  
We knew we'd have to give  
It hit us where we lived  
  
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)  
After all that we've been through together  
You took away my darkest nights (nights)  
No one else could see the light  
  
Runnin' blind day after day  
Some things never want to change, oh, oh  
We knew we'd have to give  
It hit us where we lived  
  
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)  
After all that we've been through  
You took away my darkest nights (nights)  
No one else could see the light  
  
I do, I do believe in you (I do believe in you)  
After all that we've been through  
You took away my darkest nights (nights)  
No one else could see the light ...

I walk along the road and past your door  
Then I remember things you said  
I know in time we could've been so much more  
But if you wanna come back home, go right ahead  
But I don't believe in miracles  
I don't believe in miracles  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are  
I believe I was your game, your ball (your ball)  
If you tossed me up then I would fall  
And so you've won again, ah, you win them all  
But I believe I'd run to you, if you should call  
But I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are (tell me where you are)  
I believe that somewhere there's someone  
Who's gonna light the way when things go wrong  
The bullet that shot me down came from your gun  
The words that turned me round were from your song  
But I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are (tell me where you are)  
But I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
I don't believe in miracles (don't believe in miracles)  
But I thought you might show your face  
Or have the grace to tell me where you are  

We used to laugh  
We used to cry  
We used to bow our heads then  
Wonder why  
But now you're gone  
I guess I'll carry on  
And make the best of what you've left to me  
Left to me, left to me  
  
I need you  
Like the flower needs the rain  
You know, I need you  
Guess I'll start it all again  
You know, I need you  
Like the winter needs the spring  
You know I need you  
I need you  
  
And every day  
I'd laugh the hours away  
Just knowing you were thinking of me  
Then it came  
That I was put to blame  
For every story told about me  
About me, about me  
  
I need you  
Like the flower needs the rain  
You know, I need you  
Guess I'll start it all again  
You know, I need you  
Like the winter needs the spring  
You know I need you  
I need you, I need you

The day leaves me where I started  
Somewhere out in the cold  
The night enters broken-hearted  
One more suffering soul  
Baby, I can't tell you what is real  
I can only tell you what I feel  
Why must every line on the page  
Have a question mark  
  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
  
Look back across my shoulder  
The road was clear and wide  
Time, am I really that much older  
Where did the highway divide  
Baby, I remember every dream  
I just can't remember what they mean  
Still I find them hiding in my heart  
That's the crazy part  
  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
  
Here, wishing I could hold you till the dawn reappears  
Out there in the distance  
Somewhere in the shadows  
Something in the silence  
Something that I had, oh  
I can't tell you what is real  
I can only tell you what I feel  
And baby, all I'm feeling is alone  
That's the hardest part  
  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
It keeps me in the dark (it keeps me in the dark...)  
Keep on searching (it keeps me in the dark...)  
Keep on searching (it keeps me in the dark...)  
Keep on searching (it keeps me in the dark...)

The sand, feel the waves between your toes  
Can you feel the way the old wind blows  
From one to another  
Here to discover  
Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Honeysuckle vines outside the door  
Dandelion wine and so much more  
We can discover  
Into each other  
Indian summer

Indian summer  
Indian summer  
Night fall, fireflies light up the lawn  
Pink skies mirrored on the sea at dawn  
From one to another  
Here to discover  
Indian summer

Indian summer  

It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Ev'rywhere you go  
Take a look in the five and ten glistening once again  
With candy canes and silver lanes aglow  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in ev'ry store  
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be  
On your own front door  
  
A pair of hopalong boots and a pistol that shoots  
Is the wish of Barney and Ben  
Dolls that will talk and will go for a walk  
Is the hope of Janice and Jen  
  
And Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Ev'rywhere you go  
There's a tree in the Grand Hotel, one in the park as well  
The sturdy kind that doesn't mind the snow  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Soon the bells will start  
And the thing that will make them ring is the carol that you sing  
Right within your heart  
  
Mom and Dad can hardly wait for school to start again  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
Toys in ev'ry store  
But the prettiest sight to see is the holly that will be  
On your own front door, on your own front door  
  
It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas  
It's beginning

The child breaks each moment of sadness for our sakes  
Leaving, trying his best to believe then  
Hoping this dream will come true  
Sadness is only a face for you  
  
I will try like the devil to bear your names  
Anything for you  
In only a moment your life can change  
  
Still lake, rocking the boat it's not too late  
Leaving, trying your best to believe then  
Hoping this dream will come true  
Sadness is only a face for you  
  
I will try like the devil to bear your names  
Anything for you  
In only a moment your life can change  
  
You fell through the window and down on the floor  
You found a direction, you hope will say more  
With your life, it's taken every one in view  
  
The people are pretty  
The flowers are, too  
You don't get to heaven  
If they don't say you do  
  
Cause it's life and it's taken every one of you  
And it's true  
I'd like to take you but I don't think there's room for two  
I'd like to take, I'd like to take you [Repeat: x9]

James Holladay was a working man  
He made his living on the land  
But living alone was too much to stand  
So Jim found a woman to understand  
  
Two years passed living in joy  
When out of the blue came a baby boy  
Just to keep up the family name  
Mister Holladay said we'll call him little James  
  
So you better run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta get away  
You better better run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta get away  
You better better run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta get away (Jim you gotta get away)  
  
Little James became a working man  
He followed his pa right across the land  
At the end of the day when his work was done  
He'd sit and watch the setting southern sun  
  
Nineteen years had come and gone  
Little Jimmy had grown up big and strong  
He didn't know that his time had come  
When they handed him a shiny black gun  
  
So his pa said, run, run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta getaway  
So you better run, run, run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta get away  
So you better run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta get away (Jim you gotta get away)  
  
Run, run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta getaway  
You better better run, run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta get away  
You better better run, run, run, run, run, run (Jim you gotta get away)  
Jim, you gotta get away

Just to think I had her in my hands  
To think we made our plans  
Somehow it feels just like a dream  
  
For I played it so darn cool  
Is there a bigger fool  
To say I wanted to be free  
Cause now I know just what she meant to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Jody, even the wind says your name, girl  
When I think of you I'm aflame, girl, every time  
Jody, girl I've tried but I can't forget  
The years when we lived together  
I thought it would be forever  
Jody, I'm begging now  
  
Look around but there's no way out  
What's it all about  
And how that name goes round my head  
I still see her face as she laid upon this bed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just say the word, I'll run to you  
I'll be the man you want me to  
How I'd miss you I never knew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Even the wind says your name girl  
When I think of you I'm aflame, girl  
Jody, even the wind says your name, girl  
When I think of you I'm aflame, girl

There will be no more confusion  
There will be no more ball and chain  
I will cease with the illusions  
And I will ask of you the same  
  
When you love someone  
It's gonna take some time  
  
Come on and save me, save me  
Pull me from deep water  
Give the kiss of life  
Now is the moment treasured  
Breathe the kiss of life  
Into the words we speak, into the words we speak  
  
And coming across the meadow  
Like a slow moving train  
Long determination  
Will forever remain  
  
When you love someone  
It's gonna take some time  
  
Come on and save me, save me  
Pull me from deep water  
Give the kiss of life  
Now is the moment treasured  
Breathe the kiss of life  
Into the words we speak, into the words we speak  
  
Give the kiss, give the kiss of life  
Give the kiss, give the kiss of life  
Save me ...

She came out of the blue and into my world  
She came out of the blue and into my world  
I went out of my head over you  
She was a lady with a bluebird sleepin' in her chair  
She was dreamin' 'bout a girlfriend and wishing she was there  
She was a lady with a bluebird  
Under the bridge I saw Mercury flow  
Between me and you and a fine tooth comb  
She came out of the blue and into my world  
She was a lady with a bluebird sleepin' in her chair  
She was dreamin' 'bout a girlfriend and wishing she was there  
She was a lady with a bluebird  
I close my eyes, I still see blue  
I hear her voice, I'll wait for you  
I still see blue  
She came out of the blue and into my world  
Oh, she came out of the blue and into my world  
She was a lady with a bluebird sleepin' in her chair  
She was dreamin' 'bout a girlfriend and wishing she was there  
She was a lady with a bluebird

Oh, I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isn't really giving  
Oh, I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isn't really giving  
  
But I don't care how long it takes  
For the days to get nice  
'Cause me and my friends, you know we're ready  
And willing to pay the price  
  
Oh, la la la ....  
  
Way deep down inside  
I know I'm on a free ride  
But when the green light turns to red  
Who is living, who is dead  
  
They've taken out the river  
And they've put in a cement road  
It's made the going a whole lot lighter  
But made a much heavier load  
  
I don't know how long I can go on like this  
Don't know how long I can go on like this  
Don't know how long I can go on like this  
  
I see the light switch on the wall  
With no legs I'm still tall  
We might not make it at all  
I can see the river and the little place where I would swim  
Where did it all begin  
I wish I knew  
  
Oh, I wish that I could find the reason why  
Living isn't really giving  
Isn't really giving  
Isn't really giving

I'm feelin' alright  
I'm sleepin' OK  
I'm getting to work on time  
But everything else I guess  
Has really turned out a mess  
Oohhh  
  
What can I do  
What can I say  
Nothing will change your mind  
I'm thinkin' that I should call  
But baby I'm not that kind  
  
Woman look at me now  
I'm doing better on my own somehow  
Woman I'm making my way through the day now  
Hey now  
Woman look what you've done  
Unleashed this fool on everyone  
Woman I'm making my way through the day  
  
I'm shining my shirt  
I've ironed my shoes  
I think that I'm lookin' fine  
I'm getting all kinds of looks  
Forgot how much time it took  
  
I run out of gas  
I fall on my ass  
It's happenin' all the time  
What am I doing wrong  
I'm practicing all day long  
  
Woman look at me now  
I'm doing better on my own somehow  
Woman I'm making my way through the day now  
Hey now  
Woman look what you've done  
Unleashed this fool on everyone  
Woman I'm making my way through the day  
  
Life is so strange  
Roles constantly changing  
Hey hey hey  
  
Woman look at me now  
I'm doing better on my own somehow  
Woman look what you've done  
Unleashed this fool on everyone  
Woman look at me now

Woman look at me now  
Dih diddah diddah  
Woman look at me now  
Di diddah di diddah

Gotta find me a hole to hide my head in the ground  
Look up, look down

But that'll be the seventy-second time in advance  
Look up, look down

Hey Slim how long's it been  
Five minutes maybe 10  
Can't wait to see you again and again  
First taste of this romance  
Hell baby I almost danced  
Caught myself close to believing  
But every time is a brand new feeling  
Lay me down in cool clear water  
For a moment I've forgot her  
Still I know where this is leading  
  
Win, lose, which we choose  
Won once and once refused  
Already burning down the fuse  
Don't wanna be building walls  
Cause everything rising falls  
It's darkness here the light's concealing  
Love it seems is too revealing  
Hidden in some secret place  
Etched in lines around my face  
The ghosts in here are all competing  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm  
  
Down, down we all fall down  
Down, down we all fall down  
We all fall down, yeah we all fall down  
Let's toast to new love blooming  
It's all around and all consuming  
It's a dream you're bound to follow  
Til you find it's only hollow  
I can hear the angels grieving  
Over one more song about love and leaving  
Ummmmm

It's a lovely night  
It's a lovely night  
Well, the sky is clear and the stars are bright  
It's a lovely night  
  
But I'll go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
Keep on movin', keep on playin' that game  
Let's go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
  
It's a lovely night (It's a lovely night)  
It's a lovely night (It's a lovely night)  
Well, the sky is clear and the stars they are bright  
It's a lovely night (It's a lovely night)  
  
But I'll go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
Keep on movin', keep on playin' that game  
Let's go lookin' for the fallin' rain  
On this lovely night  
This lovely night  
On this lovely night  
  
On this lovely night  
This lovely night

Wo ho ho ho ho ho, this lovely night  
Wo ho ho ho ho ho, this lovely night  
Wo ho ho ho ho ho, this lovely night

Horizon rising up to meet the purple dawn  
Dust demon screaming, bring an eagle to lead me on  
For in my heart I carry such a heavy load  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road  
  
I'm hungry, weary, but I cannot lay me down  
The rain comes, dreary, but there's no shelter I have found  
It will be a long time till I find my abode  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road  
  
Moon rising, disguising lonely streets in gay displays  
The stars fade, the night shade falls and makes the world afraid  
It waits in silence for the sky to explode  
Here I am on Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road  
Walking Man's road, walking Man's road, walking Man's road

Midnight rolling in, sunlight  
Reaching out for your return  
  
[Chorus]  
As you were running through the tunnel of life  
And soon you'll dance around the fire of fright  
Tonight  
  
When you're standing on the corner  
And the sun is getting hot  
Does this day begin to worry you a lot  
  
You are, what you are, too far  
Golden star, a ruby light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you're standing on the corner  
And the sun is getting hot  
Does the day begin to worry you a lot

Sometimes when you're there all alone  
Someone will call you at home  
You don't want to but pick up the phone  
Might be your love  
Might be your heart  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Someone who you thought would belong  
Came passing, moved right along  
You don't know why but something went wrong  
Might be your love  
Might be your heart  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Someone to hold you, someone to hold  
Someone to hold you, someone to hold  
Some girl who you watched at her desk  
Came dancing on with her dress  
And she looked up and wouldn't you guess  
She might be your love  
Might be your heart  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
(Someone to hold you)  
Might be your love (Someone to hold)  
Might be your heart (Someone to hold you)  
Might be your love (Someone to hold)  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark  
Might be your love (might be your love)  
Might be your heart (might be your heart)  
Someone to hold you  
All alone in the dark ...  

I haven't seen forever  
Don't even know her name  
I call on dreams and other schemes  
To try and win that game  
Now that it's over, darling  
Look into my eyes  
Seein' your own reflection  
Much to your surprise  
We're seein' mirror to mirror  
Face to face  
We look but we cannot see  
Mirror to mirror  
Seems to trace  
What happened to you and me  
And though we tried in earnest  
The distant silence yells  
We call on wings and other things  
To try and break that spell  
Now that it's over, darling  
Truth in the common cause  
We stare at our own indifference  
By seeing the other's flaws  
We're seein' mirror to mirror  
Face to face  
We look but we cannot see  
Mirror to mirror  
Seems to trace  
What happened to you and me  
Oh, mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror  
Mirror to mirror, what's come over me  
As we look inside, there's nowhere to turn  
There's nowhere to hide  
Now that it's over, darling  
Look into my eyes  
Seein' your own reflection  
Much to your surprise  
We're seein' mirror to mirror  
Face to face  
We look but we cannot see  
Mirror to mirror  
Seems to trace  
What happened to you and me  
Oh, mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror  
Mirror to mirror, what's come over me  
Mirror to mirror, mirror to mirror  
Mirror to mirror, what's come over me  

Railroad smoke sifting through the strong southern sky

First she says "Kings"  
Then he says "Aces"  
It gets pretty hard for a lady to tell  
The hearts from the faces  
  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
To me, to me, me  
  
I want to carry you across a threshold of fireflies  
And violet stones, all alone (all alone)  
Volcanic silver clouds fill pools and canyons around us  
All around (all around)  
  
But molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down, take me down  
  
So, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
To me, me, to me, me  
  
Molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down, take me down  
Yes, molten love  
Cooled by your kisses  
Take me down, take me down  
  
So, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
No, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Oh, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
Don't be afraid I know I will bring you home  
No, don't be afraid I know I will bring you home

There was a time I knew  
All that there was to know  
No one could tell me then  
I was wrong  
  
I wasn't strong enough  
To see where my weakness lay  
The world that you hold so tight  
Could slip away  
  
And from moment to moment  
Your life can change  
There's a storm over the horizon  
A sea no one can see  
  
Somewhere around the bend  
Right when you least expect  
Someone can walk away  
With no regret  
  
Leaving an empty space  
Breaking a sacred trust  
All of your shiny dreams  
Begin to rust  
  
Yes, from moment to moment your life can change  
There's a storm over the horizon  
The sea you cannot see  
  
Yes, from moment to moment  
Promise me you'll never change  
Promise me you'll stay the same  
Promise me you'll never change  
  
Yes, from moment to moment your life can change  
There's a storm over the horizon  
A sea you'll never see  
  
Yes, from moment to moment your life can change  
There's a light when the sun is rising  
A day after today  
  
Promise me you'll never change (promise me you'll never change)  
Promise me you'll stay the same (the same)  
Promise me you'll never change

Do the jitterbug out in muskrat land  
And they shimmy  
And Sammy's so skinny  
  
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed  
Singin' and jinglin' the jango  
Floatin' like the heavens above  
It looks like muskrat love  
  
Nibblin' on bacon, Chewin' on cheese  
Sammy says to Suisie "Honey would you please be my missus?"  
And she says yes  
With her kisses  
  
And now he's ticklin' her fancy  
Rubbin' her toes,  
Muzzle to muzzle, now anything goes  
As they wiggle  
And Sue starts to giggle  
And they whirled and they twirled and they tangoed  
Singin' and jinglin' the jango  
Floatin' like the heavens above  
It looks like muskrat love

I always thought that I wanted a long, new, shiny Cadillac  
That a real man wears five hundred dollar suits upon his back  
I always thought that I needed a big, old house with a million dollar view  
But baby, since we fell in love, all I needed is you  
  
Waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
She's a long haired, blue eyed, country girl  
She's better than a fantasy  
Waking up (waking up) to my American dream  
And I would not trade the whole wide world  
For what she means to me  
  
She's pretty as the moonlight on the gulf of Mexico  
And her heart is pure and true as any California gold  
I put her on a pedastel like Lady Liberty  
Know there is no finer girl from sea to shining sea

Though my love is hard to see  
Now she's gone (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)

But these tears (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
I can't contain (She's gone, she's gone)  
So can I count on you to be my light to guide me  
Right through the night beside me  
Is it all right to count on you  
Smile away these blues  
I don't care if I'm accused  
Now she's gone (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
I don't mind (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)  
But, I got a feelin' (She's gone, she's gone, she's gone)

We move mountains  
We want you to want us  
But what can we do

Here lies what she wore  
Guess I never had enough  
Out with the blue book  
Yes that I make up our minds  
  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds

Such a dark evening  
Maker of what it ain't and is  
May I ask no other guests  
They are in belief that I lost their faith  
The day that I arrived  
Make up our minds  
  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more, make up our minds  
Now Sue it gets more and more  
Now Sue, now Sue, now Sue, now Sue, Sue ...

For the last time  
I watched Old Man Took bait his hook  
And then throw his line  
Pick up his wine  
  
He's a friend of mine  
Known him all my life and his wife  
'Neath the swayin' pine  
And the clingin' vine  
Just before he left  
  
He said now young man  
Take good care don't let the bugs bite  
Please make sure to say a word at night  
For all your brothers feeling blue  
Blue, blue, blue  
All the time  
  
So I stayed awhile  
Took my tea alone, called it home  
Like a playing child  
Running wild  
  
Heard a bluejay call  
Said we got you now  
Hope you bow  
To the old man's word  
I'm sure you heard  
Just before he left  
  
He said now young man  
Take good care don't let the bugs bite  
Please make sure to say a word at night  
For all your brothers feeling blue  
Blue, blue, blue  
All the time  
  
Now young man  
Take good care don't let the bugs bite  
Please make sure to say a word at night  
For all your brothers feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue  
Feeling blue

I hear a car, I hope it's yours  
I hear the phone, I hope it's you  
It seems I spend most half my life waiting  
For the things I'll never do  
When you were here, in love with me  
There was so much (so much, so much) I couldn't see  
And I watched you home believing  
That you would never leave  
Now I can't stand to be without you  
I'm burning for one more kiss  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes I'm on target, sometimes I seem to miss you  
Night after night I lie awake  
Wond'ring how long it's gonna take  
Till I hold you close beside me  
And share the love we make  
'Cause I can't stand to be without you  
I can't take much more of this  
I dream every night about you  
Sometimes I'm on target, sometimes I seem to miss you  
Ah, oh baby turn your heart around  
Ah, (oo) baby turn your heart around  
Di, di, di, di, di, di  
Ah, (come back, da, da, da) baby turn your heart around (oh)  
(Who'm I gonna run to) Di, di, di, di, di, di  
Ah, (come back, da, da, da) let me turn your heart around (oh)  
(Who'm I gonna run to) Di, di, di, di, di, di  
Ah, (come back, da, da, da) baby turn your heart around (oh)  
(Who'm I gonna run to) Di, di, di, di, di, di ...  

(Gerry Beckley)  
  
One chance  
For a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together  
  
You soon will start running baby,  
I know you will.  
Though I've seen it coming lately,  
I love you still.  
How long must I keep on trying  
To change your mind?  
How long till there's no denying  
We're out of time?  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks,  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more,  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a new start  
But just one glance  
Tells you it doesn't matter  
So you turn 'round so you  
Don't have to face it.  
  
Where are you goin' baby?  
Where have you been?  
I don't even know you lately,  
Let me back in.  
I guess I'll just keep on waiting,  
It's all I can do.  
Feels like the future's fadin' into the blue.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a new start  
But just one glance  
Tells you it doesn't matter  
So you turn 'round so you  
Don't have to face it.  
  
One chance  
For a true love  
If a heart breaks  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more  
Though you want back together.  
  
Is there really just,  
One chance  
At a new start  
But just one glance  
Tells you it doesn't matter  
So you turn 'round so you  
Don't have to face it.  
  
One chance  
At a true love  
If a heart breaks  
Does it break forever?  
There'll be no more  
Though you want back together.

One night, one in a million  
Twilight, lastin' us through tomorrow  
Nothing can come between us  
That's what I want to do  
  
Today, there will be no competition  
I think today might be  
A one in a million for me  
I've seen the sun drop below my roof line  
I really think it might  
Be a one in a million delight  
All of my dreams go with you tonight  
  
We'll walk down the roads of our impatience  
And if one has to fall  
He won't be too proud to call  
Some doors I've closed just to reopen  
And then sometimes I find  
Everything wrong's turned to right  
All of my dreams go with you tonight  
  
One night, one in a million  
Twilight, lastin' us through tomorrow  
Nothing can come between us  
That's what I want for you

Spectators line the avenue  
The players step out right on cue  
And every night just seems the same  
Nameless faces play their game  
  
The midnight gamblers place their bets  
The tight-rope walkers check their nets  
Then comes the queen of broken hearts  
This is the way it always starts  
  
Finders find love for the evening  
Keepers keep the love they've found  
Losers lose and wind up weeping  
But it's the only game in town  
  
All hail the third string debutante  
She tries to act so nonchalant  
Chasin' the prince of alibis  
Into a smokescreen made of lies  
  
Finders find love for the evening  
Keepers keep the love they've found  
Losers lose and wind up weeping  
But it's the only game in town  
  
My window looks down on the set  
Each night the players strut and fret  
So if you'd like to join the rest  
Just choose the part that suits you best  
  
Finders find love for the evening  
Keepers keep the love they've found  
Losers lose and wind up weeping  
But it's the only game in town

Mary, have you seen better days  
And will you find different ways  
And does he really mean that much to your heart  
Carry, all of the weight you can find another man  
And lead him directly there to the source  
You've got to chart his course  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause it is only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
  
Wake up from an elusive dream  
You've got to change the scene  
It's getting so hard to see the end  
Break down all of the walls you can  
You need a helping hand  
I'm sure there's someone there just for you  
He's trying to make it too  
  
Cause it is only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
Only in your heart  
This thing that makes you want  
Start it all again  
  
You can't disregard your friends  
But life gets so hard when you reach the end  
Mary, have you seen better days

In this bookcase full of stories  
You find some of them are true  
Tales of love and glory  
Many lives of daring-do  
There is mystery and adventure  
They lie waiting there for you  
So step inside and find the other you  
Take the high road tomorrow  
But the low road today  
Reading other's sorrow  
Might just be the only way  
The father hears confession  
While the mother's feeling blue  
These characters do what you want them to  
In these pages we consume  
Lives in many colors lovers in full bloom  
And through the ages words are born  
Speaking to the senses lifting the forlorn  
There's glamour and dementia  
A message from the tomb  
Staircase to the heavens  
And secrets in the room  
When you are riding on that dark horse  
To the one that got away  
There's no regrets and no dues left to pay  
'Cause in these pages we consume  
Lives in many colors lovers in full bloom  
And through the ages words are born  
Speaking to the senses lifting the forlorn  
Drifting down the river of the make believe  
We laugh and grieve  
Hoping for an ending of our own design  
Where all is fine  
In these pages we consume  
Lives in many colors lovers in full bloom  
And through the ages words are born  
Speaking to the senses lifting the forlorn  
In these pages we consume  
Lives in many colors lovers in full bloom  
And through the ages words are born... (fade)  

Paradise  
Caught between the  
Fire and the ice  
No need to  
Think twice  
It's where I want  
To be  
Like a weather vane  
Following the  
Wind, the sun  
And rain  
The ecstasy  
And pain  
And all that  
Comes between  
Cause in the morning  
Summer breezes  
Will be coming  
My way  
Then in the evening  
Unbelieving  
I'll be ready to say  
That I am living  
Here in Paradise  
Balancing the  
Darkness with  
The light  
Silencing the fight  
Ahead is  
All I see  
Like a golden chain  
Wrapped around the  
Laughter  
And the pain  
Silencing the blame  
Let it all break free  
Then in the morning  
Summer breezes  
Will be coming  
My way  
And in the evening  
Unbelieving  
I'll be ready to say  
That we're all  
Living here in  
Paradise  
And though the sun  
Will fade away  
They say  
There's so  
Much more to  
Fill a day  
So be a  
Weather vane  
Following  
The wind,  
The sun,  
And rain  
The ecstasy  
And pain  
And all that  
Comes between  
Cause in the morning  
Summer breezes  
Will be coming  
Your way  
Then in the evening  
Unbelieving  
You'll be  
Ready to say  
That we're all  
Living here in  
Paradise  
In Paradise  
Paradise  
Living here in  
Paradise  
Between the  
Fire and the ice  
In Paradise  
Between the  
Fire and the ice  
in Paradise  
In Paradise  
In Paradise  
In Paradise  
  
  

Some came down to hang out by the river  
Others were waiting to find the night  
We stood long just waiting for the picture  
Looking at people to see what was right  
Soon came the people  
From over in the valley  
Hundreds of them walking  
Towards us in the rain  
Then we turned around  
And hid out in the alley  
Met along the stones  
Down Tomorrow Day Lane  
Take away the road and no one will remember  
How many journeys we hedged in the stone  
Friends around will take away the wonder  
Sharing a moment of being alone  
Soon came the people  
From over in the valley  
Hundreds of them walking  
Towards us in the rain  
And we turned around  
And hid out in the alley  
Met along the stones  
Down Tomorrow Day Lane  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ...  
Ba da da da da da ba, ba da da da da da ba ba ba ...  

Well, I had me a pigeon  
By the name of Fred  
But I done shot him  
In the head  
  
Had me a railroad  
Down on the ridge  
But I done blowed up  
The bridge  
  
Had me a dog  
He was my best friend  
But to him  
I done put an end  
  
Had me a farm  
Sittin' pretty on the hill  
But if you look  
You'll see it ain't there still  
  
I don't know why I done it  
Honest, it ain't like me  
But I ain't sad now I done it  
Cause a baby boy has got to be free

Someone told me you got to be free  
Someone told me to stand in the rear  
Keep on searchin' for kings in the street  
Keep on cryin' for something that's clear  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
Political poachers push plump packages  
Past pacified places  
Concerned citizens cry crude conduct  
'Cause Captain Command  
Don't do dreams  
Do dreary drivel drive  
Doctor, daddy divine  
Prize shipment tonight, tomorrow tame tempers  
To touch tender time  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
It takes one more moment of time in your life  
One more light to reveal  
One more place in the sun to turn ripe  
One more kingdom to feel  
You are one more posse to pass in the night  
One more con to conceal  
One more tiger to paint on a stripe  
One more player to deal  
It takes one more moment of time in your life  
One more light to reveal  
One more place in the sun to turn ripe  
One more kingdom to feel

Window frames a picture of winter time within my room  
Sometimes then i laugh at the funny times we had in school  
Blowing leaves, broken dreams  
Seventeen, dancing queen, dancing queen  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride  
  
Can you feel it moving inside of you? can you let it go?  
The purple ghost of england in winter time, and who i used to know  
Blowing leaves, broken dreams  
Seventeen, dancing queen, dancing queen  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am a sleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride  
  
Blowing leaves, broken dreams  
Seventeen, dancing queen, dancing queen  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride  
  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hiding from the wake of the tide  
I am asleep on a rainbow  
Hoping for the rest of the ride

Whenever it's a rainy day  
I pack my troubles up in my room  
I chase all the clouds away  
I get myself back to the womb  
  
But I know that you're gonna cry  
Tears are runnin' from your eyes  
The piece of my life you take  
Is one that so often breaks  
  
Whenever you are miles away  
I think of you the way you are  
Your shining lips, your auburn hair  
And then it don't seem quite so far  
  
Well I know that you're gonna cry  
Tears are runnin' from your eyes  
The piece of my life you take  
Is one that so often breaks  
  
Well I know that you're gonna cry  
Tears are runnin' from your eyes  
The piece of my life you take  
Is one that so often breaks

(Dewey Bunnell and Adam Schlesinger)  
  
Ride on into the driving rain  
Once more follow the trail  
Long gone into the setting sun  
Ride on you must not fail  
  
Speak out carry the message forth  
Make time use every day  
Reach out to every shining star  
Ride on follow the way  
  
And if your journey should end in the promised land  
Make sure to speak with a voice loud and true  
Shalalalala shalalalala shalalalala  
Ride on  
  
Ride on into the driving rain  
Once more seek out the fire  
Reach out to every shining star  
Ride on you must not tire  
  
And if your journey should end will you understand  
What you have learned and what you've been through  
Shalalalala shalalalala shalalalala  
Shalalalala shalalalala shalalalala  
Ride on, ride on, ride on, ride on, ride on, ride on

Wherever I go it's coming back to me  
Whoever I've known they sent it back to me  
I know the night will be all right  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me, right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true  
I put on a show, it's very clear to me  
And when I am low I feel you're near to me  
I know the night will be all right  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me, right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true  
I recall some years ago, when I truly was alone  
Now at last all that is past  
Now I'm never on my own.  
I know my light will be shining bright  
As long as your love keeps coming  
Right back to me, right back to me  
For all to see that our love is true ...  

Everyday I sit beside you  
On the bus to Madison Avenue  
Working the big gray store  
With the revolving door  
You don't even know my name  
I guess that I'm to blame  
Don't know the right things to say  
So I pretend away  
  
That I'm Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh won't you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
You staring like there's no tomorrow  
And you know what I'm thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you  
(Do do do do do do do do do do do)  
  
Tody I'm done with games  
Gonna ask you for your name  
Say I've been watching you  
I even know what you do  
Maybe today I'll tell you  
I've found the nerve to sell you  
On a guy like me  
Wishes that he could be  
  
Your Rudolph Valentino  
Pull up in a limosine  
Oh won't you come in out of the rain  
Things will never be the same  
And then just like Greta Garbo  
You're staring like there's no tomorrow  
And you know what I'm thinking of  
Right before your eyes I fall in love with you  
(Do do do...)  
  
(Repeat chorus to end of song)

Ain't it foggy outside  
All the planes have been grounded  
Ain't the fire inside?  
Let's all go stand around it  
  
Funny I've been there  
And you've been here  
We ain't had no time to drink that beer  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I understand  
You've been running from the man  
That goes by the name of the Sandman  
He flies the sky  
Like an eagle in the eye of a hurricane that's abandoned  
  
Ain't the years gone by fast  
I supposed you have missed them  
Oh, I almost forgot to ask  
Did you hear of my enlistment?  
  
[Chorus]

Sarah, please  
Where is the love you said you'd save for me  
Am I a fool to think that something's strange  
I think you've changed  
  
Golly, dad  
She was the best thing that I ever had  
Torn and battered now and due for repair  
But she's not there  
  
What does it matter and who really cares  
With no one to turn to when she's not there  
Ah, but it's all right, I'll get by  
  
Miles apart  
Left here standing with a broken heart  
Call me names but I'll refuse to cry  
Don't ask my why  
  
What does it matter and who really cares  
With no one to turn to when she's not there  
Ah, but it's all right, I'll get by

I can hear somebody knockin'  
On my bedroom door  
I find it rather shockin'  
It's my best friend's girl  
(Oo) Imagine my surprise  
There's a hungry look in her eyes  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
She said, I'm feelin' kinda lonely  
And only you will do  
Would you like to get to know me  
Like I wanna know you  
(Oo) No tellin' what a man will do  
Face to face with a woman like you  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea, see how the love goes  
I can hear her calling (calling)  
But no one understands her (no one understands)  
Beggin' me to let her in  
And she's waiting for my answer  
Should I open up the door  
And let trouble walk in  
Should I resist her even more  
Or tell her, come on in  
(Oo) No tellin' what a man will do  
Face to face with a woman like you  
See how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea, see how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  
Oh yea, see how the love goes  
Anybody here know how the love goes  

Thank the morning for bringing you  
Hope you never turn your head and run  
And thank the sun for shining, too  
Hope the darkness never comes again  
What it does to me  
Isn't good to see  
  
You say that fortune brought you  
Sailin' cross the sea  
I don't believe you  
I don't see how it's true  
I think my dreamin' brought you here  
And if I wake tomorrow will you still be near  
  
Once a miser, twice a son  
Three's a devil, four's a lot of fun  
Fun for living one and all  
Start a battle, who's the first to fall  
Hope it isn't me  
Have to wait and see  
  
You say that fortune brought you  
Sailin' cross the sea  
I don't believe you  
I don't see how it's true  
I think my dreamin' brought you here  
If I wake tomorrow will you still be near  
Should I live with rain and then the sky will clear

It's a long, long way from here to there  
Silent shadows over the dateline  
We both stare at the same blue moon  
Under the sheltering sky  
  
Some say love is the rarest word  
Some say truth's just a point of contention  
I know we have a love never mentioned  
Under the sheltering sky  
  
Will we wake from an endless dream  
Will our worlds come tumbling around us  
I can hear a silent scream  
Crying in the night  
  
Am I fading in your eyes  
Is my memory clear as the day we met  
For now we must both remain  
Under the sheltering sky  
Under the sheltering sky

Found on your move, the very best of America, and highway.  
  
Yesterday she stood here with me  
I kissed her mouth, I had her in my hands  
That kind of love, it could last forever  
And together we made our plans  
  
And then I woke up today  
There on the table her letter lay  
Tellin' me she's goin' away  
  
Runaway, boy have you seen a  
Girl like an angel runnin' in the night  
She's run away, boy if you see her  
I'm beggin' you to stop her on sight  
  
[Chorus]  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
She's a runaway, a runaway  
And why she'd leave I still can't believe  
That she would run away, run away  
Run away, run away  
She's a runaway  
  
I walked the streets through the heart of the city  
Go to the places where she might be  
I see her friends they say it's a pity  
I get the same thing from everyone that I see  
  
I'll keep searchin' if it's gotta be  
And when I find her I'll make her see  
No other man could love her like me  
  
Runaway, boy have you seen a  
Girl like an angel runnin' in the night  
She's run away, boy if you see her  
I'm beggin' you to stop her on sight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Run away, run away  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
She's a runaway, a runaway  
And why she'd leave I still can't believe  
That she would run away, run away  
  
If you see her tonight then stop her on sight  
She's a runaway, a runaway  
And why she'd leave I still can't believe  
That she would run away, run away

Do wop, do wop ...  
You've got to give, you've got to live  
You've got to show everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
You've got to shout all about  
You've got to tell everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
'Cause I know just how it feels  
To find that love is real, so real  
You've got to shout all about  
You've got to tell everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
'Cause I know just how it feels  
To find that love is real, so real  
You've got to give, you've got to live  
You've got to show everyone that you know  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
Till you know she's beside you  
Do wop, do wop ...  

I was on a sleeper train  
Bound for anywhere  
And I was gazin' out the window  
In a long stare  
Watchin' the sage brush go by  
And a pink and yellow sky  
Thinkin' 'bout your eyes  
Feelin' good to be alive  
I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
And I was watchin' the towns drift into view  
Listenin' to my thoughts of you  
And the rhythm of the wheels  
And the shadows on the hills  
Leavin' one more life behind  
Never knowin' what I'd find  
Such a distant great expanse  
And the dust-devils, they dance  
And I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
Abandon everything that went before  
Ahead now lies another open door  
Abandon everything that went before  
I was on a sleeper train  
Bound for anywhere  
And I was gazin' out the window  
In a long stare  
Watchin' the sage brush go by  
And a pink and yellow sky  
Thinkin' 'bout your eyes  
Feelin' good to be alive  
I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
I was dreamin' of you  
Feelin' lucky  
The train kept rollin'  

Someday woman, someday will come  
Someday woman, we'll get along  
Well it's easy to say I'm right  
And so easy to see I'm wrong  
Someday woman, we'll get along  
Someday woman, we'll understand  
Someday woman, I'll be your man  
Well it's easy to say I'm right  
And so easy to see I'm wrong  
Someday woman, we'll get along  
Someday our hearts will come together  
We'll live this dream forever  
We'll see all we've been through  
Someday for me and you  
Ba, da, da, da, da ,da  
Ba, da, da, da, da ,da  
Ba, da, da, da, da ,da  
Ba, da, da, da, da ,da  
I keep hopin' someday soon will come for me  
I keep lookin' there's too much to see  
Someday woman, way down the line  
Someday woman, we'll turn out fine  
Well it's easy to say I'm right  
And so easy to see I'm wrong  
Someday woman, we'll get along  
Someday (someday) our hearts will come together (will come together girl)  
We'll live this dream forever (someday we will)  
We'll see all we've been through (you know it's true)  
Someday for me and you  
Ba, da, da, da, da ,da  
Ba, da, da, da, da ,da

Into each life a little sunlight wants to shine  
Let me tell you, a fortune like that once was mine  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything  
  
When I found her I'd been looking everywhere  
When I lost her I was lost beyond despair  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything  
  
Dreams are hard to take (dreams are hard to take)  
Could it be I loved her too much  
  
Oo, a special girl  
Oo, a special girl  
She was a special girl  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything  
  
Bottom line is, she was fine in every way  
And it's not with hesitation that I say  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
And I gave her everything  
  
Dreams they come and go (dreams they come and go)  
But thoughts of her are like a floor show  
  
Oo, a special girl  
Oo, a special girl  
She was a special girl  
  
She was a special girl  
She meant the world to me  
I gave her everything

Stereo  
We hear both sides  
We sympathize  
We live our lives in stereo  
The left and the right  
The dark and the light  
We wrestle with the balance  
We change our tone  
We leave our phone  
And tape record our absence  
In lovin' memory  
  
Stereo  
We're livin' it in stereo  
We fix it so our love is high fidelity  
Mix it so we never lose the melody  
We try to equalize our lives in stereo  
  
So on we go  
From side to side  
As we divide  
A single life in stereo  
The far and the wide  
We override  
The feedback from the others  
The unkind phrase  
We lock in phase  
We're only really listening to the stereo  
  
Stereo  
We're livin' it in stereo  
We tune it till we have a perfect parody  
Commune with such a fine-cut, crystal clarity  
It seems to symbolize  
Our lives in stereo  
  
Oo (la, la, la, la, la, la), yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oo (la, la, la, la, la, la), yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oo (la, la, la, la-a)  
  
Stereo  
Stereo  
We fix it so our love is high fidelity  
Mix it so we never lose the melody  
We try to equalize our lives in stereo  
  
Stereo  
Stereo  
We fix it so our love is high fidelity  
Mix it so we never lose the melody  
We try to equalize our lives in stereo

Sunrise sunset  
Can't sleep can't forget  
Thought I heard your footsteps  
Coming home to me  
  
Love comes, love grows  
Sure as the wind blows  
Like the single red rose  
You will have your day  
  
Now is the moment to come to your senses  
Tear down the walls and set fire to the fences  
Run away, run away  
  
L. A. Earthquake  
Midnight ground shake  
Somewhere in the heartache  
There is hope you'll see  
  
Now is the moment and now is forever  
Now is the time it will all come together  
Run, you gotta run  
  
Once it was only a question of giving  
Now we're destroying the life that we're living  
Run, you gotta run  
  
Run away, run away  
You gotta run away, run away  
  
Sunrise sunset  
Can't sleep can't forget  
Thought I heard your footsteps  
Coming home to me

I'll survive you, I will survive you  
Well, it's too late, I know, to change the way we go  
From this day on I want to stay on  
Now that I've started learning  
And the tides started turning  
Well, it's here I want to stay  
  
[ Chorus: ]  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
I'm alive here, I can survive dear  
Though the weather might change  
From the wind to the rain  
Well, my heart remains the same  
  
[ Chorus: ]  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
  
Looked out on a sea of trouble  
And I tried to stall for awhile  
It's so hard to answer every question  
And it's hard to protect your heart anymore  
  
[ Chorus x3 ]  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival (I am alive)  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival (but I wonder)  
Where do we go from here  
  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival (I am alive)  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival (but I wonder)  
Where do we go from here  
  
I'll let the moon announce my arrival (I am alive)  
To every eye that cares to see  
Just working on the art of survival (but I wonder)  
Where do we go from here

Golden rings and hair tied with ribbon  
Early spring when winter's forgiven  
Laughing past pleasures warm by the fire  
Come inside  
Silver vase, take a drink flower petal  
Whistling songs like steam from the kettle  
Carry silence like driftwood that rides  
On the tide, on the tide, on the tide  
Tall treasures, large as Alaska  
There forever, never put out to pasture  
Then the night will fall  
Bringing peace to all  
Darkness there together  
Soft light bells and tea, draw the curtain  
China cups, some shatter for certain  
Laughin past pleasures warm by the fire  
Come inside  
Tall treasures, large as Alaska  
There forever, never put out to pasture  
Red river runs here beside us  
Grey morning will never divide us  

It's another tequila sunrise  
Starin' slowly 'cross the sky, said goodbye  
He was just a hired hand  
Workin' on the dreams he planned to try  
The days go by  
  
Ev'ry night when the sun goes down  
Just another lonely boy in town  
And she's out runnin' 'round  
  
She wasn't just another woman  
And I couldn't keep from comin' on  
It's been so long  
Oh, and it's a hollow feelin' when  
It comes down to dealin' friends  
It never ends  
  
Take another shot of courage  
Wonder why the right words never come  
You just get numb  
It's another tequila sunrise, this old world  
Still looks the same,  
Another frame, mm...

Lir: I've had time to write a book  
About the way you act and look  
But I haven't got a paragraph  
Words are always getting in my way  
Anyway, I love you  
That's all I have to tell you  
That's all I've got to say  
  
And now, I'd like to make a speech  
About the love that touches each  
But stumbling, I would make you laugh  
I feel as though my tongue were made of clay  
Anyway, I love you  
That's all I have to tell you  
  
I'm not a man of poetry  
Music isn't one with me  
It runs from me  
It runs from me  
(Duet)  
Lir: And I tried to write a symphony  
Amalthea: Once when I was searching  
Lir: But I lost the melody  
Amalthea: Somewhere out of reach  
Lir: Alas I only finished half  
Amalthea: Far away  
Lir: And finish I suppose I never may  
Amalthea: In a place I could not find  
Lir: Anyway, I love you  
Amalthea: Or heart obey  
Lir: That's all I have to tell you  
Amalthea: Now that I'm a woman  
Lir: That's all I've got to say  
Amalthea: Now I know the way  
Lir: That's all I've got to say  
Amalthea: Now I know the way  
Together: That's all I've got to say

We're feedin' the world but we can't feed ourselves  
They tell us don't plant now but there's nothing on the shelves  
If someone is watchin' down from above  
What in the world is he thinkin' of  
Daisy I think we must sell the farm  
And you know I don't wanna cause alarm  
The times are a changin', the money is gone  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
If someone is watchin' down from above  
What in the world is he thinkin' of  
Daisy I think we must sell the farm  
And you know I don't wanna cause you harm  
The times are a changin', the money is gone  
Where do we go from here, where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here  

When the last eagle flies over the last crumbling mountain  
And the last lion roars at the last dusty fountain  
In the shadow of the forest though she may be old and worn  
They will stare unbelieving at the last unicorn  
  
When the first breath of winter through the flowers is icing  
And you look to the north and a pale moon is rising  
And it seems like all is dying and would leave the world to mourn  
In the distance hear the laughter of the last unicorn  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive  
When the last moon is cast over the last star of morning  
And the future has passed without even a last desperate warning  
Then look into the sky where through the clouds a path is torn  
Look and see her how she sparkles, it's the last unicorn  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive

Author unknown (sung by Gerry Beckley)  
Found on Heard.  
  
Snow is falling  
Evening calling  
On knees, a calling friends  
Can't you see  
Doesn't help to be  
The end  
  
Strolling through lost times with you  
What were we thinking of  
Could it be they jumped the queue  
In the winter of our love  
  
Baby, we should've known  
Where we were going  
Should've known  
Where we were going  
We're in the sea of destiny  
In the winter of our love  
  
Do you know we're alone out here  
What am I thinkin' of  
Did this come to the time of year  
Called the winter of our love  
  
Baby, we should've known  
Where we were going  
We should've known  
Where we were going  
We're in the sea of destiny  
In the winter of our love  
  
Oh, I needed you so  
Ah, you know, I never, never want to let you go

When the whistle blows  
And the goodbye hugs are over  
Then the train pulls out of the station and rolls towards the dawn  
With that old suitcase in hand and a surefire plan gone over  
This time it will work it can't go wrong  
Cause I've got all of our dreams mixed up with my schemes  
Rollin' around in my mind  
I know the sun's gonna shine  
Shine on me this time  
In a week or two  
I'll be writing to you with good news  
And I can just see your smile as you read about all that I've done  
Cause I've got all of our plans right here in my hands  
And things are gonna work out just fine  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine  
Shine on me this time  
I've seen confusion in your eyes  
I've seen uncertainty and fear  
Keep on lookin' for tomorrow  
Soon it will be here  
This time, it's gonna be this time  
This time, it's gotta be this time  
This time, this time (it's never never)  
This time, this time (the day is coming)  
This time, this time (it's never never)  
This time, this time (the day is coming)  

Sitting by the fireside with a book in your hand  
Two lazy dogs sittin' watchin' your man  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
  
I gotta stop and see what I'm on about  
Stop and feel what I want I gotta  
Stop and see what I'm on about  
Stop and feel what I want with you  
Ah  
  
Walking through a wonderland, I got you by the hand  
Every move we made, just as if it were planned  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
Three roses were bought with you in mind  
  
I gotta stop and see what I'm on about  
Stop and feel what I want I gotta  
Stop and see what I'm on about  
Stop and feel what I want with you  
Ah

Think I'll write a different song  
Got a feeling it might take a long time  
Singin' it over again, I can't recall just how it used to be  
Voices across the sea  
Mm, mm, mm.  
  
Will she come to me, to keep me company  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
  
Gotta take the good with the bad  
Sometimes I wish I never had my say  
Always goes that way, or is it just the way I feel today?  
Voices across the way  
Mm, mm, mm.  
  
Will she come to me, to keep me company  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again  
Won't know till the sun comes up again

Sometimes late  
When things are real  
And the people share the gift of gab  
Between themselves  
  
Some are quick  
To take the bait  
And the catch the perfect prize  
That waits among the shells  
  
But Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man  
That he didn't, didn't already have  
And Cause never was the reason for the evening  
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad  
  
So please  
Believe in me  
When I say I'm spinning round, round, round, round  
Smoke glass stain'd bright colors  
Image going down, down, down, down  
Soapsud green like bubbles  
  
Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man  
That he didn't, didn't already have  
And Cause never was the reason for the evening  
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad  
  
So please  
Believe in me  
When I say I'm spinning round, round, round, round  
Smoke glass stain'd bright colors  
Image going down, down, down, down  
Soapsud green like bubbles  
  
No, Oz never did give nothing to the Tin Man  
That he didn't, didn't already have  
And Cause never was the reason for the evening  
Or the tropic of Sir Galahad  
  
So please believe in me

To each his own it's plain to see  
To walk alone you have to be  
It's all for you and all for me, you'll see  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are, I'll love you still  
For my life is my conscience, the seeds I sow  
I just wanted to let you know  
  
Familiar faces that I've seen  
Turnin' red and turnin' green  
They just got caught with writing on their sleeve, I guess I'll leave  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are, I'll love you still  
Will you cancel my papers and lock the door  
Cause I ain't gonna be 'round no more  
  
Will I make it through the summer  
Breaking ties with the old and new  
Losing one just gains another  
There is nothing I can do  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are I'll love you still  
For my life is my conscience, the seeds I sow  
And I just wanted to let you know  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are, I'll love you still  
Will you cancel my papers and lock the door  
Cause I ain't gonna be 'round no more  
  
I'm gonna miss you, yes, I will  
No matter who you are I'll love you still  
For my life is my conscience, the seeds I sow  
And I just wanted to let you know  
  
I'm gonna miss you ..

Here i am, there you are  
Who would believe we could come this far  
We're beneath this magic moon  
The ocean plays it's own sweet tune  
The summer breeze it whispers low  
It tells us something we both know  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
How we feel for each other  
There could be no other  
So he sent these words from above  
Tonight is for falling in love  
Oo, ah  
  
(oo, la, la ... ) tonight there's magic in the air  
Look around, it's everywhere  
Hear the sand birds bill and coo  
Actin' like they know it too  
Hear the wind pass through the trees  
Like it's tellin' everyone it sees  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
How we feel for each other (ah)  
There could be no other  
So he sent these words from above  
Tonight is for falling in love  
  
There can't have ever been such a night  
I don't want it to end  
With you in my arms girl i feel so high  
Hell, i don't ever want to descend  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
How we feel for each other (ah)  
There could be no other  
So he sent these words from above  
(i love you)  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
And i can't hold you enough (oo)  
  
Tonight is for dreamers  
Tonight someone up there has seen us  
He sent these words from above  
Tonight is for falling in love

Unconditional love  
Unconditional fear  
Unconditional support  
In your time of need  
Oo, it's unconditionally true  
Oo, it's unconditionally me  
Unconditionally you  
It's a spiritual world  
When the darkness comes  
But you gotta hold your head up  
Hold your head up high  
Oo, you got to take a look around  
Oo, and listen when you hear the sound  
Unconditional love (love)  
This is right, this I know  
I found out, long time ago  
Someday baby we'll get there I know, oh, oh  
Unconditional love  
Unconditional hope  
Unconditional desire  
To have it work out fine  
Oo, it's unconditionally true  
These things we're dreamin' of  
Oo, it's unconditionally yours  
Unconditional love (love)  
Oo, it's unconditionally true  
These things we're dreamin' of  
Oo, it's unconditionally yours  
Unconditional love (love)  
(Love)  

From this day on, I'll watch the setting sun  
As if it might be my last  
And as I view the changing color hue  
I see the long shadows pass  
  
Van Go Gan, Van Go Gan  
Get a a grip, if you can  
Van Go Gan, Van Go Gan  
Watch it slip through your hands  
  
And through these eyes, all the starry skies  
In my mind will explode  
As I lie in my bed at night  
I see my lifeline erode  
  
Van Go Gan, Van Go Gan  
Grab ahold, if you can  
Van Go Gan, Van Go Gan  
Something I understand  
  
So much waiting, sentimental memories  
Hesitating, maybe I'm just a wanna be  
  
Van Go Gan, Van Go Gan  
Get a grip if you can  
Van Go Gan, Van Go Gan  
Watch it slip through your hands  
Van Go Gan, Van Go Gan  
Something I understand

Chewing on a piece of grass  
Walking down the road  
Tell me, how long you gonna stay here Joe?  
Some people say this town don't look  
Good in snow  
You don't care, I know  
  
Ventura Highway in the sunshine  
Where the days are longer  
The nights are stronger  
Than moonshine  
You're gonna go I know  
  
'Cause the free wind is blowin' through  
Your hair  
And the days surround your daylight  
There  
Seasons crying no despair  
Alligator lizards in the air  
  
Wishin' on a falling star  
Watchin' for the early train  
Sorry boy, but I've been hit by  
Purple rain  
Aw, come on Joe, you can always  
Change your name  
Thanks a lot son, just the same  
  
Ventura Highway  
In the sunshine  
Where the days are longer  
The nights are stronger  
Than moonshine  
You're gonna go I know  
  
'Cause the free wind is blowin' through  
Your hair  
And the days surround you daylight  
There  
Seasons crying no despair  
Alligator lizards in the air

(Dewey Bunnell)  
  
Would it matter to you  
If we just took a walk  
To see where this path leads to  
Maybe stop in awhile  
Lay down, see you smile  
Looking up at those clouds in view  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
  
With the snow in your hair  
A crystal halo you wear  
While the chill winter air streams through  
Amid the birch and the oak  
Smell the fireplace smoke  
And the warmth we will go home to  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
  
Oh whoa...  
  
It doesn't matter that the sky isn't blue  
A walk in the woods will do  
Sometimes it's better just being alone  
Being alone with you  
Being alone with you

I was a child in the '60s  
So unsure of my direction  
I would follow where my friends and family would lead  
I was strengthened  
When I first heard the music  
Sparked by inspiration  
I was scarred by the pain  
Of constant departures  
I was wounded severely  
At an early age  
But my hopes hung high  
On the thought of the future  
I was happy to watch  
  
The time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Day for night  
Watching the time go by  
  
And then the world changed  
There was hope in the distance  
Til it raced up around us  
And proceeded to shine  
Like the moonlight  
Full of reckless abandon  
We would reach for the stars  
'Cause there was room at the top  
And food on the table  
We were doing quite well  
At such an early stage  
There was no need to stop  
Nor were we able  
And no one could see  
  
The time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Day for night  
Watching the time go by  
  
There are moments I regret more than the rest  
There are days I can't recall at all  
Looking back now, there's not much that I would change  
I am happy to watch  
  
The time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Eye to eye  
Watching the time go by  
  
Watching the time go by  
Day for night  
Watching the time go by  
Watching the time go by  
Why, oh why  
Watching the time go by

Watership Down, gather around  
There's a story to be told  
It's for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ear's to the ground  
  
Whisper it loud, carry the sound  
Of the footsteps alone  
When they're heading for home  
Through the raining of the dangers  
And the grayness of the dawn  
  
[Chorus]  
I can feel there's better days  
Well, they're coming, they're coming  
I can see them through the haze  
So can you  
  
Watership Down, gather around  
There's a story to be told  
It's for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ear's to the ground  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Watership Down, gather around  
There's a story to be told  
It's for the young and for the old  
You might hear them in the distance  
If your ear's to the ground  
  
Whisper it loud, carry the sound  
Of the footsteps alone  
When they're heading for home  
Through the raining of the dangers  
And the grayness of the dawn.  
  
[Chorus]

You can take your time  
I'll be takin' mine  
We don't have to hurry  
  
Let the world go by  
Tonight it's you and I  
Feelin' others slowly  
  
And though a simple touch  
Can mean so much  
Says all you need to know  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So don't let go, just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Let's make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
We got all night  
  
It's so good to know  
You don't have to go  
Stay until tomorrow  
  
Lying side by side  
Feel the senses slide  
Let your feelings follow  
  
'Cause tonight is ours  
And through the hours  
Love goes on and on  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So don't let go, just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Let's make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
We got all night  
  
Feels like we waited a lifetime  
To be alone tonight  
So make it hard to forget you  
'Cause we don't know when  
We can do it again  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So don't let go, just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Let's make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
  
All night  
All night  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So don't let go, just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Let's make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow  
  
We got all night  
We got from sundown to sunrise  
So don't let go, just hold me baby  
We got all night  
Let's make it last forever  
Take it nice and slow ...

Wednesday morning was the last time we talked  
I guess she figured it was better if she walked  
It could've been me just the same  
There's no winner in this game  
Oh, Wednesday morning was the last time we talked  
Wednesday evening was the first time she cried  
It could've turned out different if I'd lied  
Something deep within us all  
Sees the writing on the wall  
Oh, Wednesday evening we didn't talk at all  
I've been waiting every evening  
Wondering what I'm gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
It could've been me just the same  
There's no winner in this game  
Oh, Wednesday evening and nothing is the same  
(Oh) I've been waiting every evening  
Wondering what I'm gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
Wednesday morning, yeah  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
I've been waiting every evening  
Wondering what I'm gonna say  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away, yeah  
Wednesday morning, yeah  
Sometimes life can be deceiving  
Wednesday won't go away  
Wednesday morning, yeah  

(Great hits of the sixties)  
Look the lady's got a photograph  
Silver framed and velvet backed  
Well, she took it quite a while ago  
Funny that she never let me know  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh, oh  
And now she's wearing satin shoes  
Gilded hair to pay the dues  
I guess that I should tip my hat  
I wonder if she'd think of looking back  
What does it matter to me  
If it doesn't show  
I just don't know  
It's only just a memory  
Just a little history  
Oh, oh  
In the parking lot late at night  
Paper straws never worked out right  
I knew I wanted to  
But didn't know why  
So I just said "Hi"  
(Everybody sing along now)  

Albuquerque will be there in the morning  
Purple mountains will rise up from the floor  
After that you can just lift up the curtain  
And the whole world will be there at your door  
Down the road you see the heat waves a waving  
All the signs are telling you where to go  
And for you, this is a bold invitation  
It's all you need, you don't need any more  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Now the sun is rising out of the ocean  
Diesel trucks are flying by on the shore  
Yes that's your spirit inside you just waiting  
It's time to move, now that much you must know  
Step outside and take a breath of the morning (step outside the door)  
And the wind will tell you which way to go  
You are the needle on the compass for certain  
The missing map has come back to your door  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Thunder in the canyon waking up the night (waking up the night)  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Albuquerque will be there in the morning  
Purple mountains will rise up from the floor  
After that you can just lift up that curtain  
And the whole world will be there at your door  
Those wheels are turning once again  
Thunder in the canyon waking up the night (waking up the night)  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Barking in the canyon waking up the night  
Black crow with an indigo glow on the highway  
Those wheels are turning once again  
They've always been your truest friend
