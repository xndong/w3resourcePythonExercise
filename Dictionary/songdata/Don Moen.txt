Lovely are Your dwelling places  
Thirsty I come after You  
Jesus, my joy, my reward  
Your love's restoring my soul  
Now I'm Yours and You are mine  
And from my heart a song will rise  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
Jesus, there is none beside You  
Righteous Ruler of the earth  
Nations will come and bow down  
Name above all names  
I sing Your praises  
And all that I can say to You is  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
I love You, I love You, I love You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You  
And my heart will follow wholly after You (wholly after You)  
And my heart will follow wholly after You

Chorus:  
Fresh fire let it fall  
O God hear our call  
Send Your Spirit like a rushing wind  
We need fresh fire  
  
We are hungry we are thirsty  
Crying our for more of You  
Lord we are desperate for Your mercy  
Let us burn to know Your Truth  
Light a flame in us now  
Send Your holy fire down  
  
We have left our hearts unguarded  
We confess we've walked away  
Lord take us back to where we started  
Where we first found love and grace  
Light a flame in us now  
Send Your holy fire down  
  
More of Your love  
More of Your power  
Send a revival  
We need it now  
Stir up a fire  
Let it burn brighter  
Let the flame burn higher higher higher  
  
Revive us again

[Chorus]  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night, His light will shine  
God is good, God is good all the time.  
  
If you're walking through the valley  
And there are shadows all around  
Do not fear, He will guide you  
He will keep you safe and sound  
'Cause He's promised to never leave you  
Nor forsake you and His Word is true  
  
[Chorus]  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night, His light will shine  
God is good, God is good all the time  
  
We were sinners and so unworthy  
Still for us He chose to die  
Filled us with His Holy Spirit  
Now we can stand and testify  
That His love is everlasting  
And His mercies - they will never end  
  
[Chorus]  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night, His light will shine  
God is good, God is good all the time  
  
Though I may not understand  
All the plans He left for me  
My life is in Your hands  
And through the eyes of faith, I can clearly see  
  
[Chorus]  
God is good all the time  
He put a song of praise in this heart of mine  
God is good all the time  
Through the darkest night, His light will shine  
God is good, God is good all the time

God will make a way  
Where there seems to be no way  
He works in ways we cannot see  
He will make a way for me  
  
He will be my guide  
Hold me closely to His side  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way  
  
Oh, God will make a way  
Where there seems to be no way

Hold me closely to His side  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way  
  
By a roadway in the wilderness, He'll lead me  
And rivers in the desert will I see  
Heaven and Earth will fade but His Word will still remain  
And He will do something new today  
  
Oh, God will make a way  
Where there seems to be no way  
He works in ways we cannot see  
He will make a way for me

With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way  
  
With love and strength for each new day  
He will make a way, He will make a way

He walked where I walked  
He stood where I stand  
He felt what I feel  
He understands  
He knows my frailty  
Shared my humanity  
Tempted in every way  
Yet without sin  
  
God with us  
So close to us  
God with us Emmanuel  
Emmanuel  
  
One of a hated race  
Stung by the prejudice  
Suffering injustice  
Yet he forgives  
Wept for my wasted years  
Paid for my wickedness  
He died in my place  
That I might live  
  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel  
Emmanuel

Lord I stand in the midst of a multitude  
Of those from every tribe and tongue  
We are Your people redeemed by Your blood  
Rescued from death by Your love  
There are no words  
Good enough to thank You  
There are no words to express my praise  
But I will lift up my voice  
And sing from my heart  
With all of my strength  
  
Hallelujah hallelujah hallelujah  
To the Lamb  
Hallelujah hallelujah  
By the blood of Christ we stand  
Every tongue every tribe  
Every people every land  
Giving glory giving honor  
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God  
  
Lord we stand by grace in Your presence  
Cleansed by the blood of the Lamb  
We are Your children called by Your name  
Humbly we bow and we pray  
  
Release Your power  
To work in us and through us  
Till we are changed  
To be more like You  
  
Then all the nations will see  
Your glory revealed  
And worship You  
  
Every knee shall bow  
Every tongue confess  
That You are Lord of all  
  
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God  
Giving praise unto the Lamb of God  
Jesus Christ Lamb of God

When you've prayed every prayer that you know how to pray.  
Just remember the Lord will hear and the answer is on it's way.  
  
Our God is able.  
He is mighty.  
He is faithful.  
  
And He never sleeps, He never slumbers.  
He never tires of hearing our prayer.  
When we are weak He becomes stronger.  
So rest in His love and cast all of your cares on Him.  
  
Do you feel that the Lord has forgotten your need.  
Just remember that God is always working in ways you cannot see.  
  
Our God is able.  
He is mighty.  
He is faithful.

Heal me Oh Lord,

Here we are lifting our hands to You  
Here we are, giving You thanks for all You do  
As we praise, and worship Your holy name  
You are here, dwelling within our praise.  
  
For every answered prayer  
For always being there  
For love that hears us when we call  
For arms that lift us when we fall  
Oh You have always been, right beside us  
Leading us all along the way  
And we made it through (we made it through)  
Because of You  
  
[Chorus]  
And here we are  
  
For days we cannot see (for days we cannot see)  
For all that yet to be (so much is yet to be)  
The trials we may have to face  
When we'll be leaning on your grace  
It will be your strength, that safe's us  
Your love that makes us strong  
And through it all (through it all)  
We'll sing this song  
  
Here we are lifting our hands to You  
Here we are, giving You thanks for all You do  
As we praise, and worship Your holy name  
You are here (yes You are) dwelling within our praise (x2)

Holy and acceptable  
And pleasing in my sight

Siempre quiero estar  
Solo quiero estar  
Quiero estar cerca de ti  
(se repite primer verso)  
Oh mi dios  
Eres mi fuerza  
Y mi cancion  
Y en mi debilidad  
Tu poder me sostendra

(1)  
You are my everything  
You are my only Lord  
The song that I sing  
The answer when I call  
(2)  
You are my everything  
You are my only Lord  
It's in you that my life is blessed  
You are my righteousness  
You are my only Lord  
(3)  
You are my everything  
You are my only Lord  
You're the strength of my life  
You lift me when I fall  
(4)  
You're my everything  
You are my only Lord  
You're my Father who cares for me  
You have created me  
You are my only Lord  
  
You are my only Lord (2x)  
  
Repeat(1), (2)  
  
It's in you that my life is blessed  
You are my righteousness  
You are my only Lord (2x)
