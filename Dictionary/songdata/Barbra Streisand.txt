Tell me where  
Where is it written  
What is it I was meant to be?  
That I can't dare  
It all began the day I found  
That from my window I could only see  
A piece of sky  
I stepped outside and looked around  
I never dreamed it was so wide  
Or even half as high  
The time had come  
(Papa, can you hear me?)  
To try my wings  
(Papa, are you near me?)  
And even thought it seemed at any moment I could fall  
I felt the most  
(Papa, can you see me?)  
Amazing things  
(Can you understand me?)  
The things you can't imagine  
If you've never flown at all  
Though it's safer to stay on the ground  
Sometimes where danger lies  
There the sweetest of pleasures are found  
No matter where I go  
There'll be memories that tug at my sleeve  
But there will also be  
More to question, yet more to believe  
Oh tell me where?  
Where is the someone who will turn and look at me?  
And want to share  
My every sweet-imagined possibility?  
The more I live - the more I learn  
The more I learn - the more I realize  
The less I know  
Each step I take  
(Papa, I've a voice now!)  
Each page I turn  
(Papa, I've a choice now!)  
Each mile I travel only means  
The more I have to go  
What's wrong with wanting more?  
If you can fly - then soar!  
With all there is - why settle for  
Just a piece of sky?  
Papa, I can hear you  
Papa, I can see you  
Papa, I can feel you  
Papa, watch me fly!

When a bee lies sleepin'  
In the palm of your hand  
You're bewitched and deep in love's  
Long looked after land  
  
Where you'll see a sun up in sky  
With the mornin' dew  
And where the days go laughin' by  
As love comes callin' on you  
  
Sleep on bee, don't 'waken  
Can't believe what just passed  
He's mine for the taken  
I am happy at last  
  
Maybe I dreams but he seems  
Sweet golden as a crown  
A sleepin' bee done told me  
I will walk with my feet off the ground  
  
When my one true love  
I has found  
  
Sleep on bee, don't 'waken  
Can not believe what just passed  
He's mine for the taken  
I am happy at last  
  
Maybe I dreams but he seems  
Golden as a crown  
A sleepin' bee told me  
I will walk with my feet off the ground  
  
When my one true love  
I has found

Cold winds may blow o'er the icy sea  
But I'll take with me  
The warmth of thee  
A taste of honey,  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return  
He'll come back  
For the honey and me  
I leave behind  
My heart to wear  
And may it e'er remind you of  
A taste of honey  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
He will return...he will return...  
He'll come back for the honey and me.  

They tell us lies, they try to tell us who we are  
But we have grown  
And we remember in the future not to cry  
You could be an angel  
Look in your ancient eyes  
  
What do you see?  
Knowing what the power of your future could be  
To fall and then to rise  
It's knowing how it was  
And how that sets you free  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
Through the rhythm of ages, blinded in the sun  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
  
So let them talk  
They won't be hiding any secrets from the eyes of a child  
Things can never be but what they are to you  
You could be an angel  
Make all your dreams come true  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
Through the rhythm of ages, blinded in the sun  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
  
Stand up, freedom is for everyone to know  
Tell them what your truth is when you play  
Stand up, freedom is the message in your song  
In the light of what is swept away  
There's someone there to catch you when you fall  
  
All the children will send out love to everyone  
All the children will dance and sing for you  
(High above)  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
(See how they run)  
Blinded in the sun  
(Got to be sure)  
All the children will dance  
(Watch how they shine)  
And sing for you  
(This is love)  
  
All the children will send out  
(Just like before)  
Love to everyone  
(This is the place)  
All the children will dance  
(This is the time)  
And sing for you  
(High above)  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
(See how they run)  
Blinded in the sun  
(Got to be sure)  
All the children will dance  
(Watch how they shine)  
And sing for you  
(This is love)  
  
All the children will send out  
(Just like before)  
Love to everyone  
(This is the place)  
All the children will dance  
(This is the time)  
And sing for you  
(High above)  
  
Through the rhythm of ages  
(See how they run)  
Blinded in the sun  
(Got to be sure)  
All the children will dance  
(Watch how they shine)  
And sing for you  
  
High above, high above, this is love  
High above, this is love, high above, this is love

[Fanny:]  
  
Am I blue  
Am I blue  
Ain't these tears in these eyes telling you  
Am I blue  
You'd be too if each plan with your man  
Done fell through  
There was a time, I was his only one  
But now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Lordy  
Was I gay  
Till today  
Now he's gone and we're through  
Am I blue  
There was a time, I was his only one  
But now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Oh lordy  
Was I gay  
Till today  
Now he's gone and we're through  
Now he's gone and we're through  
Oh god, did you hear that note  
It was given to me by my friend Grace Moore on my birthday  
Oy, was she glad to get rid of it  
Through  
I think I give it to her back, or her front  
Am I blue  
Oy, is this thing heavy

Do you wake up very slowly?  
Does it take a while before you smile  
Are your dreams like premonitions  
Have you lived them through  
Some people do  
I hope you'll answer me with patient eyes  
No hurried words, foolish or wise  
Answer me, answer me with soft silent touches  
They'll tell me as much as i need to know  
Answer me with deep and restful sleeping  
  
And if you dream in sleep  
They're yours to keep  
No you need not answer me  
If we must part  
Should someone ask  
Who's touched your heart  
Perhaps you'll answer me

Free and easy  
That's my style  
Howdy-do me?  
Watch me smile  
  
But fare-the-well me  
After a while  
'Cause I gotta roam  
And any place I hang my hat is home  
  
Sweetenin' water  
Cherry wine  
Thank you kindly  
Suits me fine  
  
Kansas city even Carolina  
That's my honeycomb  
'Cause any place I hang my hat is home  
Birds roostin' in a tree  
  
Pick up and go  
And the goin' proves  
That's how it oughta to be  
Pick up too when the spirit moves me  
  
Cross the river  
'Round the bend  
Howdy stranger?  
So long friend!  
  
There's a voice in the lonesome wind  
Keeps a whispering roam  
I'm going where a welcome mat is  
No matter where that is  
  
'Cause any place I hang my hat is home

I don't know why I'm frightened  
I know my way around here  
The cardboard trees, the painted seas, the sound here  
Yes, a world to rediscover  
But I 'm not in any hurry  
And I need a moment  
  
The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
The atmosphere as thrilling here as always  
Feel the early morning madness  
Feel the magic in the making  
Why, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
  
I've spent so many mornings just trying to resist you  
I'm trembling now, you can't know how I've missed you  
Missed the fairy tale adventure  
In this ever spinning playground  
We were young together  
  
I'm coming out of make-up  
The lights already burning  
Not long until the cameras will start turning  
And the early morning madness  
And the magic in the making  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
  
I don't want to be alone  
That's all in the past  
This world's waited long enough  
I've come home at last!  
  
And this time will be bigger  
And brighter than we knew it  
So watch me fly, we all know I can do it  
Could I stop my hand from shaking?  
Has there ever been a moment  
With so much to live for?  
  
The whispered conversations in overcrowded hallways  
So much to say not just today but always  
We'll have early morning madness  
We'll have magic in the making  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
Yes, everything's as if we never said goodbye  
We taught the world new ways to dream!

You must remember this,  
A kiss is just a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh,  
The fundamental things apply,  
  
As time goes by.  
And when two lovers woo,  
They still say "i love you,"  
On that you can rely,  
  
No matter what the future brings,  
As time goes by.  
  
Moonlight and love songs,  
Never out of date,  
Hearts full of passion,  
Jealousy and hate,  
Woman needs man, and man must have his mate,  
There's no one can deny.  
  
It's still the same old story,  
A fight for love and glory,  
A case of do or die,  
The world will always welcome lovers,  
As time goes by.

When you're just out walking and you pass  
Little signs that say "keep off the grass"  
Did you ever stop and ask yourself why?  
Pretty playgrounds children used to know  
Little squares where lovers love to go  
Disappear so parking lots can grow  
Why?  
  
Once you start the questions never cease  
What's disturbed when you disturb the peace  
Pets and children are prohibited  
  
Why? ask yourself why?  
And when you think about it  
Bullets fly like popcorn on the screen  
Recommended wholesome nice and clean  
Making love's the thing that can't be seen  
Why?  
  
Let your hair down just an inch or two  
Let your skin be red or green or blue  
They invent a special name for you  
Why?  
  
On a clear day oh say can you see  
What remains of mountain's scenery  
Catch a glimpse of all the scenery, sky,  
Beautiful sky ..as shiny as a penny  
So when you're out walking and you pass  
Near a sign that say "keep off the grass"  
Put a sign right next to it that says "why?"

Think of all the hearts  
Beating in the world  
At the same time  
Think of all the faces  
  
And the stories they could tell  
At the same time  
Think of all the eyes  
Looking out into this world  
  
Trying to make some sense of what we see  
Think of all the ways we have of seeing  
Think of all the ways there are of being  
Think of all the children  
  
Being born into this world  
At the same time  
Feel your love surround them  
Through the years they'll need to grow  
  
At the same time  
Just think of all the hands  
That will be reaching for a dream  
Think of all the dreams that could come true  
  
Yes if the hands we're reaching with  
Could come together  
Joining me and you  
When it comes to thinking of tomorrow  
  
We must protect our fragile destiny  
In this prescious life there's no time to borrow  
The time has come to be a family  
Ohhh...  
  
Think of all the love  
Pouring from our hearts  
At the same time  
Yes think of all the light our looks  
  
Can shine and grow this world  
At the same time  
At the same time  
Yes think what we've been givin  
  
And yet think what we could lose  
All of life is in our trembling hands  
It's time to overcome our fears  
And join to build a world that loves and understands  
  
It helps to think of all the hearts  
Beating in the world  
And hope for all the hearts  
Healing in the world  
  
There's a healing music in our hearts  
Beating in this world  
At the same time  
At the same time

Autumn, it feels like autumn  
Although the breeze is still  
I feel the chill of autumn  
Oh, yes, it's autumn  
It's always autumn  
However green the hill  
To me it still is autumn  
I can feel the frost now  
That makes my spring and summer dreams  
Seem lost now  
Why can't the autumn haze  
Recall the days of warm summer laughter?  
That faded soon after in the autumn  
He left in autumn  
And though another season's here  
I feel the emptiness of autumn  
All the year...  

Et les vents do nord, les emportant  
Dans la nuit blanche de n'oubli  
Que moi, je n'ai pas oublie  
La chanson que tu me chantais  
The falling leaves drift by the window  
The autumn leaves of red and gold  
  
I see your lips, the summer kisses  
The sun-burned hands I used to hold  
Since you went away the days grow long  
And soon I'll hear old winter song  
But I miss you most of all, my darling  
When the autumn leaves start to fall

Hear our prayer  
We have sinned before Thee  
Have compassion upon us and upon our children  
Help us bring an end to pestilence, war, and famine  
Cause all hate and oppression to vanish from the earth  
Inscribe us for blessing in the Book Of Life  
Let the new year be a good year for us

Well I'm stacking up skirts and things  
Packing up and fixing to go  
For some little reason that I can't remember  
And this leavin' is a grievin' me so,  
But just one little kiss could put  
All of this leavin' behind,  
Yeah, baby me Baby and  
Maybe I might change my mind  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
Make all my blues go away  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
I'll baby you the same way.  
  
Sometimes the times are good times and  
Sometimes the times  
Are not quite so good as the good times should be  
And that's when leavin' starts to enter my mind  
But just one word from you and  
I'll put all of my suitcases down  
Yeah, baby me Baby and  
Maybe I might stick around.  
  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
Make all my blues go away  
Baby me Baby everyday  
Baby me Baby and  
I'll baby you the same way.

If you don't want to get nervous  
Do yourself a great big service  
Stay away please far from seventh avenue  
You can lose your sense and reason  
Guessing what style for next season  
Yes, the dress business will make a wreck of you  
It's a battle of fierce and grim  
That depends on the ladies' whim  
What'll miss and misses america's answer be  
Will she say with a tossing head  
And that rare guy wouldn't drop dead  
Or she'll say : yes, this dress is really me  
On guessing what, a day will say  
A sheer impossibility  
This poor kid's brave, he worked away  
And try to build that industry  
How crazy, bold and reckless  
Can human beings be...  
Hip, hip, hooray! for the garment trade  
Hear the cheer to push the music hits us everyone  
Day after day...they go on this way  
To the cockeyed way the job that must be done  
Off to the fray on the brave crusade  
Gallant ladies' garment trade  
Though in health got speed  
In a gesture breed, made all answers on parade  
What a business what a sack game  
Yet it's about as much your business is a crap game  
Snapper, zipper, bowler, button  
All we know is what the experts know from nothin'  
So the last line you got pie with  
Coming right up is another you could die with  
If you're right the dough could flow in  
If you're not you haven't got a pot to sew with  
Off to the fray on the brave crusade  
Gallant ladies' garment trade  
Though in health got speed  
In a gesture breed, made all answers on parade  
Off to the fray on the brave crusade  
Gallant ladies' garment trade

You've gotta get up every morning  
Put a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart  
Then people are gonna treat you better  
You're gonna find,  
Yes you will  
That you're beautiful as you feel  
Waiting at the station  
With the work day wind a-blowing  
I've got nothing to do  
But watch the passers by  
Mirrored in their faces  
I see frustration growing  
And they don't see a-showing  
Why do I?  
You've gotta get up every morning  
Put a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart  
Then people are gonna treat you better  
You're gonna find,  
Yes you will  
That you're beautiful as you feel  
I have often asked myself  
The reason for the sadness  
In the world  
But tears are just a lullaby  
If there's any answer  
May be love kind  
And the madness may be not  
Oh, but we can only try  
You've gotta get up every morning  
Put a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart  
Then people are gonna treat you better  
You're gonna find,  
Oh, yes, you will  
That you're beautiful...  
Yes, you're beautiful...  
Yeah, beautiful as you feel!

Dolly  
Before the parade passes by  
Before it goes on, and only I'm left  
Before the parade passes by  
I've gotta get in step while there's still time left  
I'm ready to move out in front  
Life without life has no reason or rhyme left  
With the rest of them  
With the best of them  
I wanna hold my head up high  
I need got a goal again  
I need got a drive again  
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again  
Before the parade passes by...  
Before the parade passes by  
I've gotta go and taste Saturday's high life  
Before the parade passes by  
I've gotta get some life back into my life  
I'm ready to move out in front  
I've had enough of just passing by life  
With the rest of them  
With the best of them  
I can hold my head up high  
For I've got a goal again  
I've got a drive again  
I wanna feel my heart coming alive again  
Before the parade passes by  
[Interlude]  
  
[All:]  
When the parade passes by  
Listen and hear that brass harmony growing  
When the parade passes by  
Pardon me if my old spirit is showing  
All of those lights over there  
Seem to be telling me where I'm going  
  
[Dolly:]  
When the whistles blow  
And the cymbals crash  
And the sparklers light the sky  
I'm gonna raise the roof  
I'm gonna carry on  
Give me an old trombone  
Give me an old baton  
Before the parade passes by!

Everyone comes from  
One father one mother  
So why do we complicate  
Our lives so much  
By being at war with each other  
  
Mm, maybe I'm crazy  
But I don't understand it  
Why do we seem to vote  
To dig more holes  
It's such a waste of a planet  
  
There must be a reason  
That I can't see  
Maybe somebody else now  
Knows better than me  
  
All I know is  
Everyone else is  
A sister or a brother  
So we've got to look around  
Again and stop  
Being at war with each other  
Being at war with each other  
  
Oh  
Maybe I'm crazy  
But I don't  
No, I don't understand it  
(There must be a reason)  
There must be a reason  
(There must be a reason)  
There must be a reason  
  
That I can't see  
Somebody else must be  
Better than me  
All I know is  
Everyone else is  
A sister or brothers  
So we've got to look around  
Again and stop  
Being at war with each other  
Being at war with each other

I can't apologize for the way I feel  
Cause I've always been honest with you  
I've loved you the best I could  
In the only way I knew  
And If that's not enough I've got nothin' to say  
And I'm not even sure that I would  
Somedays it was bad and somedays good  
But I've loved you the best I could  
  
I need more... I need someone to hold me tonight  
Someone there when I turn out the lights  
Just to be here with me  
I need more...  
I need more than you somehow  
I need more than your time will allow  
I want you as my friend  
Why can't you be that now?  
  
You say you need me, then you'd be gone  
The times I needed you  
Then you'd hold me and say you're sorry  
But what else could you do?  
Yet I know you really loved me  
So it's hard to let go like I should  
Let's forget the bad  
Remember the good  
Cause you loved me the best you could  
  
But I need more  
I need someone to hold me tonight  
Someone there when I turn out the light  
Just to be here with me  
I need more, I need more than you somehow  
I need more than your time will allow  
Remember the times that were good  
We both loved the best we could

Between yesterday and tomorrow,  
There is more there is more than a day.  
Between day and night between black and white  
There is more, there is more than gray.  
  
Between the question and the answer  
There's the silence of the sea.  
Between the cradle and the grave,  
There is the someone that is me.  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow,  
There is more there is more than a day.  
  
There's every dawn you've ever seen,  
And every thing you've ever known.  
There's every hand you've ever touched or that ever was,  
Or that could have been, or that should have been.  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day.  
Between day and night, between black and white  
There is more, there is more than gray.  
  
Between the summer and the winter, there's a multitude of falls.  
Between the entry and the exit, there's a labyrinth of halls.  
Between yesterday and tomorrow  
There is more there is more than a day.  
  
There's every plan you'll dare to make  
And every dream you'll dare to dream.  
There's every word you'll hope to say,  
All that's yet to be, all that ought to be, all that has to be--  
  
Between yesterday and tomorrow.  
Between yesterday and tomorrow.

By the way did I hear you say  
If some night I seem too lonely  
You would stay  
Oh and by the way  
Have I told you yet that only recently  
He moved out on me  
Took the towels we stole  
From some motel in tennessee  
He was gone long before he really left  
I knew it ...  
By the way he began to say:  
Love takes time, I'm in a hurry  
Anyway that's all yesterday  
Let's get back to us  
Why worry?  
If you try calling by and by  
Oh, and by the I thought I mention  
You can't stay...  
Neath the lights  
You don't look a thing like he did  
And it's time to play  
It's another day  
Why can't we make love fall  
By the way?  

Church bells were ringing and I heard angels singing  
On the day that I said "I do"  
He gave me a kiss and I thought wedded bliss  
Was a mother-to be's dream come true  
The he carried me across the threshold and I heard the front door slam  
Cabin fever had just began  
Pack his lunch at six-thirty but do not disturb him  
Cause he wants to sleep in till eight  
If I don't remind him it's time to get up  
He tells me it's my fault he's late  
Now I clean up the kitchen till noontime  
And then I vacuum till a quarter to three  
Cabin fever is killing me  
  
At seven he calls up and says "don't cook supper"  
When he knows that it's already done  
My kids climb the curtains and I climb the walls  
He's with the boys having fun  
Let me try to get a breath of fresh air  
And all I ever get's the third degree, I got to leave here  
Cabin fever's killing me  
Cabin fever's killing me  
I gotta leave here  
Cabin fever's killing me

(Robert Telson)  
  
A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Some place better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixing  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
I am calling you  
(Don't you hear me)  
I am calling you  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The baby's crying and I can't sleep  
But we both know a change is coming  
Coming closer, a sweet release  
I am calling you  
(I know you hear me?)  
I am calling you  
I'm gonna walk through the desert to find you  
Gone leave behind the only life I know  
There's a place for hearts that need fixing  
A little cafe with a magic show  
I am calling you  
(Can't you hear me?)  
I am calling you  
Desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
That coffee machine still needs fixing

Can you tell the moment?  
Spring becomes the summer  
Maybe it's a moment  
Only known to a tree  
  
Even as we're watching  
Blades of grass are growing  
Leaps and bounds, so tiny  
That our eyes cannot see  
  
And how does a bud  
Decide it's a rose  
Perhaps there's a time  
When it somehow knows it  
  
Can you tell the moment?  
If there's such a moment  
When you just become  
What you were not before  
  
Is there any sign or warning  
Or do you awake one morning  
Knowing that you must have turned  
A special corner?  
  
Maybe in an April shower  
Something tells a bud to flower  
What is it that tells you  
You're a child no more

[From "Show Boat"]  
  
Oh listen sister,  
I love my mister man,  
And I can't tell you why  
There is no reason why I should love that man,  
It must be somethin' that de angels have planned.  
Fish gotta swim, birds gotta fly,  
I gotta love one man till I die.  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.  
Tell me he's lazy, tell me he's slow,  
Tell me I'm crazy, maybe I know.  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine  
When he goes away, that's a rainy day,  
And when he comes back that day is fine,  
The sun will shine!  
He can come home as late as can be,  
Home without him ain't no home to me,  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.  
Can't help lovin' that man of mine.

C'est si bon  
Lovers say that in france  
When they thrill to romance  
It means that it's so good  
C'est si bon  
So I say to you  
Like the french people do  
Because it's oh so good  
Every word, every sigh, every kiss, dear,  
Leads to only one thought  
And the thought is this, dear!  
C'est si bon  
Nothing else can replace  
Just your slyest embrace  
And if you only would be my own for the rest my days  
I will whisper this phrase  
My darling, my darling...  
C'est si bon!

Beggar standin' on the corner sing your song  
Sing it for a dime  
Bring them all the pain you carried down the line  
Your music's flyin' post their ears  
Goin' through your troubles for the herd to follow  
The out of tune ravings of the crippled crow  
Movin' down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you  
And the cup-o tin you carry  
Is just a ticket to get you in  
  
Beggar standin' on the corner dry your eye  
You're tiring now  
The tears you're tastin' now are only salty time  
Your music's lasted thru the year  
Goin' through your troubles for the herd to follow  
The out of tune ravings of rhe crippled crow  
Movin' down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you  
And the crown of thorns you're wearing  
Is just a ticket to get you in  
  
The our of tune ravings of the crippled crow  
Moving down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you  
The out of tune ravings of the crippled crow  
Moving down the ladder slow  
Where your friends on knee will help you

Now you say you're lonely  
You cried the lone night through  
Well, you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
Well, you can cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me,  
Nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember?  
I remember all that you said  
Told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well, just to prove you do  
Cry me a river  
Cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me  
Nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember?  
I remember all that you said  
Told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me...  
  
And now you say you love me  
Well, just to prove that you do...  
Come on! come on!  
Cry me a river...  
Cry me a river...  
I cried a river over you  
I cried a river over you...

Oh it's crying time again  
Youre gonna leave me  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
I can tell by the wayyou hold me, darling  
That it wont be long  
Before it's crying time  
Oh they say that absence makes  
The heart grow fonder  
(fonder)  
And that tears are on their way  
To make love grow  
(grow)  
Well, my love foryou could never,  
Never, never, never grow no stronger  
(stronger)  
If I live to be a hundred,  
And I say a hundred years old  
Oh you say that youve found someone  
You love better  
That's the way it's happened  
Every time before  
(before)  
And as sure as the sun comes out tomorrow  
(tomorrow)  
Crying time will start  
When you walk out  
When you walk out my door  
Oh it's crying time again  
Youre gonna leave me  
(I can feel it now)  
I can see that faraway look in your eyes  
(I can feel it now)  
(I can see it baby inyour eyes)  
I can tell by way you hold me, darling  
That it wont be long before it's crying time  
No it wont be long before it's crying time!

They say her pretty face is enough to launch a ship  
Mix that with charm and style  
How you gonna miss  
With all the admiration the world is at her feet  
She's living for attention when she's spotted on the street  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
Dinner an a movie  
I'll just show my face in town  
Rumors fly so fast that I don't try to live'em down  
Gets old answering questions why and trying to explain  
Why I prefer to stay at home with friends and entertain  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
To the outside world it's paradise  
They'd love to be in my shoes  
They don't seem to realize that it's not like in the news  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
I just read in the papers that I bought some birds today  
Flying all around my house  
Just havin' their own sweet way  
It makes me feel so foolish 'cause they called my house a cage  
But there's nothing I can do  
Just puts me in a rage  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that I lead  
Don't believe it  
Don't believe what you read  
Don't believe it  
About the life that we lead

Four little angels of peace are we  
Loving our neighbors so peacefully  
There's really no harm if we do not disarm  
For we always in close harmony  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
With fall or with friend  
We will fight to the end  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Though we butchered the boss  
And I've own made the choice  
And slaughter the irish no end  
Though I'm injured and poor  
Slaying hoard upon hoard  
We're but playing the part of a friend  
Yes, our arms we ain't twist  
But we'll be elected for peace  
Except in the case of the crook  
We conquered both spears  
Now we're up to our ears  
Just trying to keep what we took  
Three little angels of peace are we  
Living together so blissfully  
Oh, we never fight unless  
We're on the right  
But we're always in the right, you see?  
Three little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
Until we are wrecks  
We'll break each other's necks  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
In japan we've the right  
In a generous night  
But the emperor knows peace is finer  
It isn't our fault it's a case of absurd  
We're picked down and buried by china  
Oh, how we're deplored  
I glad did it for the world  
We're a nation of poets and thinkers  
Also, though we bound without pity  
And lay west to his city  
It's because all the chinese are stinkers  
Two little angels of peace are we  
Living together in amity  
We'll sign any pack saying we won't attack  
But it's just a mere formality  
Two little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We try to keep calm  
When we gas, we bump  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  
Now I know that our war  
Is a thing to have horror  
And that peaceful fill out  
When we hope we have  
With our love from the start  
I atrocious did all my part  
To civilize nearly the hope we have  
Though you call me sadistic  
Imperialistic  
My armies required a quarry  
And though we may slave  
What's a splendid day today  
After all that we'll say that we're sorry  
Though I fall for the urge  
Of a nice bloody purge  
And living my way I was carrying on  
Though I clean up my schmutz  
Would I hear nazi putz  
It is all for the sake of the aryan  
My ambitions are small  
I want nothing at all  
My plans wouldn't be any littler  
Now that austria's nazi  
It will be hazy-gazy  
To put the whole world under hitler  
Four little angels of peace are we  
Drinking with older of saintity  
Though we slaughter the meek  
We confirm every week  
And we talk it over peacefully  
Four little angels of peace are we  
There is one thing on which we agree  
We'll shout and we'll shell  
We'll get each other's hell  
Just for peace, peace, peace...  

Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar  
Come and save the likes of me  
  
Saw your light from the street  
As I passed by the other day  
I was scared, my knees were weak  
Forgot what I had come to say  
  
Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar  
Come and save the likes of me  
  
Saw a man walk on water  
With everybody looking on  
I didn't know I was his daughter  
'Til both of us had come and gone  
  
Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar  
Come and save the likes of me  
  
If you see me in the alley  
Looking like I don't belong  
You can put me in your greenest valley  
I'll still be singing the same old song  
  
Free the people from the fire  
Pull the boat out of the raging sea  
Tell the devil he's a liar  

Funny  
Did you hear that?  
Funny  
Yeah, the guy said  
  
"Honey, you're a funny girl."  
That's me  
I just keep them in stitches  
Doubled in half,  
  
And though I may be all wrong for a guy,  
I'm good for a laugh,  
I guess it's not funny,  
Life is far from sunny,  
  
When the laugh is over  
And the joke's on you,  
A girl ought a have a sense of humor  
That's one thing you really need for sure  
  
When you're a funny girl  
The fella said "A funny girl"  
Funny  
How it ain't so funny,  
Funny girl

Look at yourself...  
If you had sense of humor  
You would laugh to beat the band...  
Look at yourself  
Do you still believe the rumor  
That romance is simply grand?  
Since you took it right on the chin  
You have lost that bright toothpaste grin  
My mental state is all a-jumble  
I sit around in sadly mumble  
Fools rush in, so here I am!  
Very glad to be unhappy  
I can't win, but here I am  
More than glad to be unhappy  
Unrequited love's a bore and I've got it pretty bad  
But for someone you adore  
It's a pleasure to be sad...  
Like a straying baby lamb  
With no mammy and no pappy  
I'm so unhappy  
But, oh, so glad!

Now that's what I call a man!What are you gonna do about Warren?  
That's the first time in my life I felt like the opposite sex.  
What are you gonna do about Warren? I wonder if he'll ask me  
Tomorrow night. What are you gonna do about Warren? What am I  
  
Gonna do about Warren? Oh, Warren doesn't care.Warren cares!  
Warren cares, but I don't care! You have to care because you're  
Engaged to him and you don't have to care about him because how  
Will he know he cares about you? Then what are you gonna do?  
  
What did you say?  
When you know there's someone loving you  
And you know there's someone you love too  
And they're not the same, what do you do?  
  
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!  
Close your eyes and hide from every care  
When you wake up they may not be there  
But tell me how can I sleep  
  
Tell me who could  
When you see your whole life tangled up good  
I could drink, I could weep  
But tell me how can I sleep?  
  
Go to sleep! Go to sleep!  
And when you and someone have a date  
(Which you made when you were thinking straight!)  
And when you and someone stay out late  
(It was bad too...)  
  
Mmm...But I had to!  
When they're not the same who gets the gate?  
(This is not the way to find a mate!)  
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!  
  
( Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep!)  
Comes the dawn I may not feel the same  
(Comes the dawn he may not know your name!)  
In the sunlight who can see a flame?  
  
But tell me how can I sleep, look what I've done  
Mess around with two men  
Soon you'll have none  
As you sow, so you reap  
  
Which is why I can't sleep, mmm...  
Go to sleep, girl! Go to sleep! Go to sleep! Go to...

So long sad times  
Go long bad times  
We are rid of you at last  
Howdy gay times  
Cloudy gray times  
You are now a thing of the past  
  
Happy days are here again  
The skies above are clear again  
So let's sing a song of cheer again  
Happy days are here again  
  
Altogether shout it now  
There's no one  
Who can doubt it now  
So let's tell the world about it now  
Happy days are here again  
  
Your cares and troubles are gone  
There'll be no more from now on  
From now on...  
  
Happy days are here again  
The skies above are clear again  
So, let's sing a song of cheer again  
Happy times  
Happy nights  
Happy days  
Are here again!

He could show me things I've never dreamed of,  
Things I've never thought of before.  
He could show me what I've missed, baby,  
Somewhere there is something more.  
I've never been there, I might get lost at sea.  
I think he's been there and he could show me.  
Could he tell me why the days were empty?  
Days I wasted waiting for tomorrow.  
Some other time, some other place,  
Some other world, some other face,  
He could show me, he could show me.  
  
[Backing Singers:]  
He could show me what I've missed, baby,  
Somewhere there is something more.  
  
[Barbra:]  
I've never been there, I might get lost at sea.  
I think he's been there and he could show me.  
Could he tell me why the days were empty?  
Days I wasted waiting for tomorrow.  
Some other time, some other place,  
Some other world, some other face,  
He could show me, he could show me.  
  
[Backing Singers:]  
He could show me, he could show me, he could show me...  
  
(Fade out)

How could I be this at ease with him?  
Pour out my heart as I please with him?  
He isn't you...he isn't you...  
When will I feel so in bloom again?  
When will his voice warm the room again?  
He isn't you...he isn't you...  
Memories may fade in the shadows behind me  
But there'll be the dream  
That will always remind me - a dream that  
I'll be forever comparing him to...  
For love me, he may even die for me  
Sweep every cloud from the sky for me  
He may be king,  
But he'll never be you...  

Look who's advertising  
Billboards everywhere  
"See hellacious acres  
Your tailor made nightmare"  
Traffic is backed up for miles  
Attendants welcome you with devilish smiles  
Steady...steady ...  
Have your tickets ready  
Steady...steady ...  
Go to hell  
After dark  
It's a sin filled city  
An amusement park  
It's a one way ticket to the other side  
It's a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde  
See Lizzie Borden, she's one of the stars  
And tricky Dicky barkin'  
Flashin' you his pardon  
Jack the ripper slashin' your tires  
Even the devil needs money  
To cover his overhead  
That's why he opened hellacious acres  
Or so his press agent said  
Hang out with heavies  
Your partners in crime  
Forget the consequences, have a good time  
Steady...steady ...  
Have your tickets ready  
Steady...steady ...  
Go to hell  
After dark  
It's a sin filled city  
An amusement park  
It's a one way ticket to the other side  
It's a Dr. Jekyll and a Mr. Hyde  
Get down and study suspicion and doubt  
At hellacious acres  
Listen mischief makers  
Admission's free you pay to get out

Oh, hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly  
It's so nice to have you back where you belong  
You're lookin' swell, Dolly, I can tell, Dolly  
You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong  
We feel the room swayin' while the band's playin'  
One of your old favorite songs from way back when  
So, take her wrap fellas, find her an empty lap, fellas  
Dolly won't never ever go away again  
Hey, hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly  
It's really nice to have you back where you belong  
Girl, you're lookin' swell, Dolly, I can tell, Dolly  
Still glowin', still crowin', you're still goin' strong

One of your old favorite songs from way back when  
So, take her wrap fellas, find her a big fat lap, fellas  
Dolly don't ever go away, Dolly don't you ever, ever go away  
Dolly don't you ever go away again  

[Horace:]  
Hello, Dolly!  
Well, hello, Dolly!  
It's so nice to have you here  
Where you belong  
I never knew Dolly  
Without you, Dolly  
Life was awfully flat  
And more than that  
Was awfully wrong  
[Dolly:]  
Here's my hat, Horace!  
I'm staying where I'm at, Horace!  
Dolly will never go away...  
  
[Horace:]  
Wonderful woman!  
  
[Both:]  
Again. ..  
  
[Townspeople:]  
Put on you Sunday clothes  
When you feel dawn and out  
Strut down the street and have your picture took  
Dressed like a dream your spirits seem to turn about  
That Sunday shine is a certain sign  
That you feel as fine as you look!  
  
Take the someone whose arms you're in  
Hold onto her tight and spin  
And one two three, one two three, one two three  
Look!  
  
[Cornelius:]  
I held her  
For an instant  
But my arms felt sure and strong  
  
[All:]  
It only takes a moment  
To be loved a whole life long...  
  
[Men:]  
Yes, it takes a woman  
A dainty woman  
A sweetheart, a mistress, a wife  
Oh yes, It takes a woman  
A fragile woman  
To bring you the sweet things  
In life!  
  
[All:]  
Well, well, hello, Dolly!  
Well, hello, Dolly!  
It' so nice to have you back  
Where you belong  
You're looking swell, Dolly!  
We can tell, Dolly!  
You're still glowin'  
You're still crowin'  
You're still goin' strong  
You'll see the crowd swayin'  
For the band's playin'  
One of your old favorite songs  
From way back when  
  
Dolly  
Wow, wow, wow, fellas  
Look at the old girl now, fellas!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Dolly, you'll never go away  
Dolly, you'll never go away  
Dolly, you'll never go away  
Again!

Here we are at last  
Children in the dark  
Running from the past  
Into the unknown  
Secrets from the heart  
Promises we make  
Lips that never part  
Until the dawn breaks  
I can't remember feeling this familiar  
I see myself becoming his  
It frightens me to learn  
That love is...  
Finally here at last  
No place left to hide  
Too powerful to fast  
To keep it inside  
Everything's so new,  
So innocent, so true  
We're reaching for that star,  
'cause darling, here we are  
Here at last  
[instrumental]  
I can't remember feeling this familiar  
I feel myself becoming his  
It strengthens me to finally see that  
Love is here at last  
No place left to run  
The actors have unmasked  
The play has begun  
Every moment true  
Each day for lovers who  
Have never come this far  
But darlin' here we are  
Here at last  
Here at last...  

When I think of home, I think of a place  
Where there's love overflowing  
I wish I were home, I wish I was back there  
With the things I've been knowin'  
Wind that makes the tall trees bend into leaning  
Suddenly the snowflakes that fall have a meaning  
Sprinkling the sea  
Makes it all clean  
  
Maybe there's a way for me to go back  
Now that I have some direction  
It would sure be nice to back home  
Where there's love and affection  
And just maybe I can convince time to slow up  
Giving me enough time in my life to grow up  
Time be my friend  
Let me start again  
  
Suddenly my world's gone and changed it's face  
But I still know where I'm goin'  
I have had my mind spun around in space  
And yet I've watched it growin'  
If you're listening God, please don't make it hard to know  
If we should believe the things that we see  
Tell us should we run away, should we try and stay?  
Or is better just to let things be?  
  
Living here in this brand new world might be a fantasy  
But it's taught me to love so it's real to me  
And I've learned that we must look inside our hearts to find  
A world full of love like yours and mine  
Like home

She was a working girl  
North of England way  
Now she's in the big time...in the USA  
And if she could hear him, this is what he'd say  
Honey pie, you are making me crazy  
I'm in love but I'm lazy  
So won't ya please come home  
Oh honey pie, my position is tragic  
Come and show me that magic of your Hollywood song  
You became a legend on the silver screen  
And now the thought of meeting you makes me weak in the knees  
Tee tee tee  
Oh honey pie you are driving me frantic  
Sail across the Atlantic to be where you belong  
Honey pie come back to me  
Oh wa wa wa...... wa wa wa wa wa wa wa... wa wa wa  
Wa wa wa wa wa wa wa wa  
I like it like this (laughing)  
Woo  
I like this...  
What kinda music (laughing)  
What kinda music, play it to me... play it to me  
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea  
Kindly send her sailing back to me? tee hee hee  
Oh honey pie you are making me crazy  
I'm in love but I'm lazy  
So won't ya please come home  
Come..come back to me honey pie  
Do do do do da da da dum  
Now don't get fresh fellas  
De da de do da dumb  
Honey pie come back...  
Soon...

How does the wine taste?  
Does it stain your lips?  
What is the fruit-like?  
Just beyond my finger tips?  
Just out of reach, I see so much  
I cannot taste and mustn't touch  
Tied to my little world  
My safe little world  
What would it be like  
If I broke the string?  
Would it be lovely  
And a little frightening?  
There is so much I've never understood  
How does the wine taste? Is it good?  
How does the wine taste?  
Does it make you glow?  
How does the wine taste?  
How does the wine taste?  
How does the wine taste?  
I think I know  

  
Fanny

You can circle the globe with my circle of friends  
Someone I am crazy for is crazy for me

Wow how lucky can you get

Wrap it up and charge it that's my is my favorite phrase  
How lucky can you get  
When I see the chauffeur think I'll give him a raise  
How lucky can you get  
Weekends in the country with the baron of course  
And a wardrobe to shock Mrs. Asters pet horse  
Making merry music with the one that I love  
We're a perfect duet  
Gee how lucky can you  
Wee how lucky can you

Satin on my shoulder and a smile on my lips  
Money in my pocket right at my fingertips  
Wrap it up and charge it that's my favorite phrase  
How lucky  
When I see the chauffeur think I'll give him a raise  
How lucky  
Life's a bed of roses whirling perfume on me  
You can spare me the blues I don't sing in that key  
And if there's a man who'd leave me I am happy to say  
I haven't run into him yet  
  
Gee wee wow  
How lucky, how lucky can you get!  

Hey buds below... Up is where to grow  
Up with which below can't compare with.  
Hurry - it's lovely up here...  
Life down a hole takes an awful toll,  
What with not a soul there to share with  
Hurry - it's lovely up here!  
Wake up, bestir yourself, it's time that you disinter yourself  
You've got a spot to fill - a pot to fill  
And what a gift package of showers, sun and love  
You'll be met above everywhere with,  
Fondled and sniffed by millions who drift by,  
Life here is rosy - if you're a posy  
Hurry it's lovely here!  
Climb up geranium, it can't be fun subterran-ium  
On the exterior, it's cheerier  
Rsvp peonies, pollinate the breeze,  
Make the queen of bees hot as brandy  
Come give at least a preview of Easter  
Come up and see the good we're giving  
Come up and see the grounds for living  
Come poke your head out,  
Open up and spread out,  
Hurry it's lovely here!

I'm starting to walk and I'm learning to run  
I'm seeing my friends and I'm having some fun  
And the heartache and pain  
Like the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
'Cause I'm not gonna cry my eyes out anymore  
There's a brand new world just waiting outside my door  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, not while the music feels so good  
You've got your friends and I'll get mine  
We're out and have a real good time  
I'm changing my style with a positive grin  
And this feeling of joy comes from within  
And the heartache and pain  
Like the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
'Cause I'm not gonna cry my eyes out anymore  
There's a brand new world just waiting outside my door  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, not while the music feels so good  
You've got your friends and I be fine  
We're out and have a real good time  
And the heartache and pain  
And the thunder and rain have all disappeared  
And I'm not gonna cry my heart out anymore  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, gonna have a party  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, I ain't gonna cry tonight  
Not while the music feels so good  
You've got your friends and I get mine  
We're out and have a real good  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, not while the music feels so good  
I ain't gonna cry tonight, I ain't gonna cry tonight  
Learning to walk learning to run  
Seeing my friends and having some fun  

Ah, okay!  
The hills are alive  
And it's pretty frightening  
The sun goes down  
  
The moon comes out  
The people gather 'round and we all begin to shout  
Ech... mud!  
You better not cry  
  
You better not shout  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa claus is dead  
  
There's a song I must sing,  
It's a well known song,  
But the tune is bitter  
And it doesn't take long to learn, I can learn!  
That pretty little world that beams so bright  
That pretty little world that seems delightful cambered  
Let me learn...let me learn...  
  
For I can see it, shining somewhere  
Bright lights somewhere invite me to compare and learn  
And I'm ready, I can hear it silent singing  
Inside my ear, I hear them all singing of love!  
  
Who knows maybe all the visions that I see  
May be waiting just for me to say  
Take me there and make me see it, make me feel it  
I know it so, I know that it really may be...  
Let me learn!

I took my chances,  
Thinking something might be saved.  
Growing tired of broken promises  
And dreams you never made.  
  
And I wanted to be more than just a friend,  
Not knowing I would hurt, so, in the end.  
So I swore I'd never call you home again.  
  
Took time to see through all the glitter  
That you made.  
I was blinded by your fire light  
And swept myself away.  
  
And I guess I couldn't bring myself to see  
You had taken all the very best of me.  
So I'm leaving while there's something left of me.  
Just like a child, I keep running back for more.  
  
You know I thought I knew the answers,  
'Cause I've been hurt before,  
And one more time around won't break me.  
You will never see that side of me,  
No, no, no, no,  
I don't break easily.  
  
I told my service to pick up all my calls,  
And I've taken down our photographs  
That lined our bedroom walls.  
And the outside door no longer has your name.  
All your clothes are gone.  
  
My welcome mat's been changed,  
But the key's still there,  
And I've left the door unchained.  
Just like a child, I keep running back for more.  
  
Oh, I thought I knew all the answers,  
I've been hurt before,  
And just one more time around  
Won't break me down.  
  
You will never see that side of me,  
No, no, no,  
I don't break easily.  
No, no, I won't break easily

I finally found someone, that knocks me off my feet  
I finally found the one, that makes me feel complete  
We started over coffee, we started out as friends  
It's funny how from simple things, the best things begin  
  
This time it's different, dah dah dah dah  
It's all because of you, dah dah dah dah  
It's better than it's ever been  
'Cause we can talk it through  
Oh, my favorite line was "Can I call you sometime?"  
It's all you had to say to take my breath away  
  
This is it, oh, I finally found someone  
Someone to share my life  
I finally found the one, to be with every night  
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone, oh, someone  
I finally found someone, oh  
  
Did I keep you waiting, I didn't mind  
I apologize, baby, that's fine  
I would wait forever just to know you were mine  
And I love your hair, are you sure it looks right?  
I love what you wear, isn't it too tight?  
You're exceptional, I can't wait for the rest of my life  
  
This is it, oh, I finally found someone  
Someone to share my life  
I finally found the one, to be with every night  
'Cause whatever I do, it's just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone, oh, someone  
I finally found someone, oh  
  
Whatever I do, it's just got to be you  
My life has just begun  
I finally found someone

Fanny  
It was a lucky april shower  
It was a most convenient dorm  
I found a million dollar baby in a five and ten cent store  
The rain continued for an hour  
I hang around for three our four  
Around a million dollar baby in a five an ten cent store  
She was selling china  
And when she made those eyes  
I kept buying china until the crop got wise  
Incidentally  
If you should run into a shower  
Just step inside my cottage door  
And meet the million dollar baby from the five and ten cent store

I'm all smiles, darlin'  
You'd be too  
If you knew, darlin'  
All of the smiles were for you  
I'm all chills, darlin'  
Through and through  
But my cold hands, darlin'  
Warm to the touch of you  
Rain hasn't fallen for days now  
But rainbows are fillin' the skies  
My heart must have painted those rainbows  
Shinin' before my eyes  
Can't you tell that I'm in love, darlin'?  
Deep and true, with guess who, darlin'  
Someone I die for  
Beg steal or lie for  
Eat humble pie for  
Someone to fly  
To the sun, moon and sky for  
Someone to live for  
To love with and cry for  
And that someone is you  

I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
  
Some fellas look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
Some fellas make a winning sometime  
I never even make a game, believe me  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
And waiting to find a little bluebird in vain  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
And waiting to find a little bluebird in vain

I got 36 expressions!  
Sweet as pie to tough as leather  
And that's 36 expressions more than all those Baltimores puttogether.  
So 'stead of just kicking me why don't they give me a lift?  
Well, it must be a plot!  
'Cause their scared that I got...such a gift?  
Well, I'll miffed.  
  
Cause I'm  
The Greatest Star  
I am by far!  
But no one knows it--WAIT!  
They're gonna hear a voice  
A silver flute (ah ah ah ah)  
They'll cheer each toot  
(Yeah, that kids terrific, mmm)  
  
When I expose it  
(Now can't ya see to look at me that)  
I'm a natural Camille.  
As Camille I just feel  
I've so much to offer  
(Now listen Mr. Z I know I'd be divine because)  
  
I'm a natural cougher  
(ahoo, aheh, ahay)  
Some ain't got it, not a lump  
I'm a great big clump of talent  
Laugh!  
(ha ha ha ha)  
  
They'll bend in half  
A thousand jokes  
(Stick around for the jokes!)  
A thousand faces  
I reiterate  
  
When your gifted, then your gifted  
These are facts  
I've got no acts to parade  
Hey, what ya blind?  
In all of the world so far  
I'm the greatest star  
  
Who is the pip with pizzas?  
Who is all ginger and jazz?  
Who is as glamorous as?  
Who's an American beauty rose?  
With an American beauty NOSE!!!  
And ten American beauty toes?  
  
Eyes on the target and wham  
One shot on gun shot and BAM!  
Hey Mr. Keeney!  
Here I am!  
  
I'm the greatest star  
I am by far  
But no one knows it  
That's why I was born  
I'll blow my horn  
'Til someone blows it  
  
I'll light up like a light  
Bright up like a light  
I'll flicker and flare up!  
All of the world's gonna star up!  
Looking down you'll never see me,  
Try the sky cause that'll be me!  
  
I can make 'em cry!  
I can make 'em sigh!  
Someday they'll clamor for my drama  
Have ya guessed YET!  
Who's the best yet?  
  
If ya ain't I'll tell ya one more time  
You bet ya last dime  
In all of the world so far  
I am the greatest, greatest  
Star!

Fanny  
I loved the man  
Truly i did  
When he would touch me i act like a love-hungry kid  
Isn't this better  
Somebody nice somebody new  
Someone who lets me react as i normally do  
Isn't this better  
Better  
Passion is fine but passion burns fast  
Passions design seems never to last  
Better a match better a blend  
Who needs a lover i need a friend  
Now i am calm save and serene  
Heartache and hurt are no longer a part of the scene  
Isn't this better  
The way it should be  
Better for him  
And also much better for me  
Isn't this better  
Better

It must be you  
Makin' me feel things I can't explain  
For some reason I'm just laughin' at the rain  
I can't believe  
Who I am has changed so suddenly  
I'm doin' things I never thought I'd do  
This is not like me  
It must be you  
  
It must be love  
Nothin' else could turn me upside down  
Or plant my feet so firmly on the ground  
What's happening  
Everything I say I want to sing  
Everything I've dreamed is coming true  
What's this feeling in my heart  
It must be you  
  
Hold me now like this forever  
And let this moment go on endlessly  
?Cause I'm alive when you're beside me  
That's how I know we're how it's supposed to be  

It must have been the mistletoe  
The lazy fire, the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That feeling everywhere  
It must have been the pretty lights  
That glistened in the silent night  
It may be just the stars so bright  
That shined above you  
Our first Christmas  
More than we'd be dreaming of  
Oh, Saint Nicholas had his fingers crossed  
That we would fall in love  
It could have been the holiday  
The midnight ride upon a sleigh  
The countryside all dressed in white  
That crazy snowball fight  
It could have been the steeple bell  
That wrapped us up within its spell  
It only took one kiss to know  
It must have been the mistletoe  
Our first Christmas  
More than we'd be dreaming of  
Oh, Saint Nicholas must have known that kiss  
Would lead to all of this  
It must have been the mistletoe  
The lazy fire, the falling snow  
The magic in the frosty air  
That made me love you  
On Christmas Eve our wish came true  
That now I've fell in love with you  
It only took one kiss to know  
It must have been the mistletoe  
It must have been the mistletoe  
It must have been the mistletoe  
One kiss to know, I love you so  

You can say what you got to say  
Wherever you go, baby, I will find a way  
I'm ready to go anywhere you choose  
It's up to you  
  
You decide if I live or die  
Wherever you go, baby, so will I  
I'm ready to accept your point of view  
It's up to you  
  
And there's something about that way you smile  
Every touch leaves me helpless  
Every moment drives me wild  
I never saw the cause that made you lie  
I never said goodbye inside  
  
You can go where you got to go  
Wherever you lead, baby, I will follow  
I'm ready to be all you want me to  
It's up to you  
  
And I walk in the dark and the candle burns  
Out of place, your face is missing  
Come the day, you return my love on hold  
This moment stops in time  
The reason and the rhyme inside  
  
You can go where you got to go  
Where you lead, baby, I will follow  
I'm ready to be all you want me to  
It's up to you  
  
It's up to you  
You, baby  
It's up to you  
Oh, it's up to you  
Oh, it's up to you

I've dreamed of you  
Always feeling you  
Were there  
And all my life  
I have searched for you  
Everywhere  
I caught your smile  
In the morning sun  
I heard your whisper  
On the breeze of night  
I prayed one day  
That your arms would hold me tight  
And just when I  
Thought love had passed me by  
We met  
That first look  
In your eyes  
I can't forget  
You melted me  
With your tender touch  
I felt all fear and sorrow  
Slip away  
Now here we stand  
Hand in hand  
This blessed day  
I promise you  
As I give to you  
My heart  
That nothing in this world  
Shall keep us apart  
Come happily ever after be  
The man I'll love  
Until the very end  
I've dreamed of you  
My great love  
And my best friend  
For god must know  
How I love you so  
He's blessed us here today  
As man and wife  
Come dream with me  
As I've dreamed of you  
All my life  
Come dream with me  
As I've dreamed of you  
All my life
