Phone Message from Ross Robinson  
"Hey dude it's Ross  
Just callin to say hey  
I'm much better now  
I fractured my spine  
It was fucked up  
I did a triple over a double  
And landed on my head  
So um...I did it on the 426  
Yep...wasn't to fun  
But before that dude I was fuckin totally in tune  
And feelin kick ass on the track  
It was like the best I've ever felt  
So maybe that's why I started gettin all cocky and shit  
Uhh...Alright man, just workin away super hardcore on Slipknot  
And I'm about 5 days left and take like a week off  
Or somethin like that and start the next one  
Hope your doin good dude  
Talk to ya later"  
  

Chorus  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
I got a nation of millions to capture  
Lyrical disaster pass the ganja  
Choppin' shit like a bladerunner  
Huntin down my opponents like the predator  
Ready to start my search like the hunt for red October 31st  
Day of my birth had much pain as an adolescent  
Natural stigmata, much drama when Mom's was stressin  
They're on my trail like the bone collector  
Select the sense from my sixth  
Inject the fluid of the wickedness  
Fuck the world! is my motto  
I just can't understand why they point the finger  
When they see me doing my thing  
Bitches swing when they see me pass by  
In the GS4 with the Cane plates bought from my last tour  
It's amityville horror on haters block  
For those that copycat my tactics trying to make it to the top  
Like in the shining when Jack Nicholson got possessed with the wickedness  
I'm true to kicking this  
Chorus  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Like Manson dismantling MCs who oppose a threat  
You really don't want to get into some shit that you'll regret  
Cause like Samuel I hold the whole place for negotiation  
Incarcerating anyone with the temptation trying to test my faith  
(is it safe to come out and play now) is he gone?  
Man I don't understand what kind of high this dude is trippin on  
Pure ICE with a twist of vanilla thriller  
Captivating souls like the body snatchers  
Its return of the living Caucasians  
Of psychopathic mind grabbing Asiatic demonic fanatics  
Causing havoc bringing the pain  
Flaming up like in Backdraft  
Feel the wrath of the lyrical combustion  
Many aren't true to what they're busting  
(from the depths)  
I'm coming through like the Hell Raiser  
It's the end of days there's no escape from the detonator  
Chorus  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this  
Lettin' loose it's the detonator setting off a time bomb, ring the alarm  
I'm coming through with the wickedness  
Inject the fluid of the sickest and watch as I kick this

Confrontation town front  
I can't front! No, I can't believe this funk  
Got a blacklash as long as some happy ass  
Clown, frown, Uh I get down  
In the trenches underneath the underground  
Under a blanket of hell you never heard rejected the sound  
Wrap your troubles in dreams baby in search of a theme  
I can't believe I'm triple teamed  
I voted! Hope my ass wasn't railroaded  
Ran for the border to avoid the slaughter  
Shit! I blamed that tape recorder cause you mad outta order  
Beyond categories, another East side story Uh  
That's three thousand miles ago  
Cause cats are shook by past crooks  
Doin' street hooks too many freestyles yo be off the books  
Be the judge make sure that needle don't budge don't prejudge  
Your frustration anger at the association  
What difference it makin got the whole world  
Hatin art of war vocals influence the locals  
It's a mad mad world we've been living everyday  
What you gone to say all man say I'm a fuck up  
Living don't throw it away  
It's a mad mad world we've been living everyday  
What you gone to say all man say I'm a fuck up  
Living don't throw it away  
Claving est operes a mixer  
Le New Jacks sont dans  
Les MC's sont pres auteur en toute Liberte  
It's a mad mad world we've been living everyday  
(Transalation) We are ready to get in the mix  
The new generation are in the place to be  
MC's are ready to express themselves freely  
Now I feel trapped in this everyday form of life  
Who's wrong or right who knows I still fight  
To survive life from the land of confusion  
Man's abusing which religion are you choosing  
Substance abusing losing touch with reality  
Have you forgot about your family values  
Can't you understand the plan  
World destruction push the button end of discussion  
Boom  
What'cha gonna do now  
It's like the sound of a Mosberg pump goin Boo Yow  
What a mad world  
We got cops on the take  
Females being raped  
Bodies floatin' in the lake  
Why Over hate  
Better check your faith cause it'll be gone before you wake  

[Verse 1]  
Get on up...i walk the beat and walk it with clarity  
I want to' make sure all's hearin' me  
Ducks who's bummin', I found your hide away  
I'm livin' large y'all so by the way  
Who rocked the crowd and rocks it loud  
On the strengths, y'all, I'm takin' bows now  
Kickin' up lyrics that others want to' rock to  
Rock like me, y'all this you can't do  
The v, the a, the n, the i, the lla y'all  
It's vanilla  
[Chorus]  
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up  
Go ill, go ill, get on up, go ill, go ill, get on up  
[Verse 2]  
Hold on girl, let your feet move free  
cause you move to the groove of vanilla i-see-e  
You come here to rock and let the white boy rap  
If you a ho, get off my lap  
cause ice stands for bein' so cold  
That's a nickname I got for bein' so bold  
Jerome stands for m.p.a  
My personal assistant, every day  
I'm not an mc who come here to play  
Yo, boy, I'm serious, I'm goin' all the way  
Rhymes are clean, there's no need to be ill  
And when I'm on the mic, I let 'em all spill  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
I rock the mic like I'm a fanatic  
When I see one, I got to have it  
I'll whip up a sound that'll burst your eardrum  
What you gonna' do? don't you play dumb  
Busy like kizzy, groovin' like rubin  
Don't care what you do, just keep movin'  
Shakin' your limbs until they wear thin  
I make your butt shake just watch the boy grin  
Simple like simon, with ice rhymin'  
Some mc's fakin' it, but I'm the diamond  
I'm the rhyme doctor, always on call  
You watch your fries, boy, or I'm gonna' take yours  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 4]  
Start skeezin' and move that hip girl  
Get in the mood and don't you quit  
Smooth as slime, king rhyme  
Rock it boy, cause it's a craime  
I'll make you scream like you're in between  
When I'm on the mic, yes I'm the king  
cause I'm hungry as a dog, i'll eat up  
My rhymes are runnin', don't interrupt  
cause I'm a throne overtaker, not an mc faker  
I like my coffee, but I can't stand sanka  
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]  
Here comes the lyrical breakdown  
Move out the way punk, and take a seat clown  
It's the Ice Man slicin', Dicin'  
Hittin' like Tyson  
So listen to the rhythm I givin' 'em  
My lyrics got the impact of a Mac truck when I'm sendin' 'em  
Yo, My funky rhymes flow  
Kickin it like psycho  
And I'm exploding like nitro-glis  
Coming like a hurricane bliss  
Straight sacking the track like a quarterback  
My man Zero is back with a killer slice  
I'm blowin' up the mic  
Ya damn right, Vanilla Ice  
With twice the punch  
I put the crunch on Marky  
And take the funky out of his bunch  
I hit the home run  
You got to third base, son  
I'm in first place  
Take a seat clown for the beatdown  
[Verse 2]  
Uh, tonight's the night of the big fight  
With the mic in my hand I got the grip tights  
Ready to swing it like a Louisville slugger  
Right at the head of a sucka  
Crack home run  
How did it feel to have the mic hit ya dome, Son? Uh!  
I tried to make your head ring like a church bell  
I put it on ya hard  
I'll make ya hurt well  
'cause you fell into my booby traps  
No more good vibrations  
I'm tired of your boots raps  
So I eat ya like scooby snacks  
An maybe roll you like a zig zag  
Or smoke you like a hootie mac  
You did what I did  
So you're gonna lose kid  
Cause to me you're still a new kid on the block  
Get off my jock, Get off my diznok  
Before you get dropped for the beatdown  
[Verse 3]  
Yeah, this is the last verse  
Should I say the last round  
And its time I knock out another class clown  
Sit down and take notes  
As Vanilla kicks ballistics with dope lyrics  
Oh what a pity, though  
Cause ya had to spend three million dollars on your video  
It was video and I can admit that  
All that money's wasted cause your song's wack  
I make stuff to make the people gather  
An' let 'em see us in a pit  
I want to slam dance with ya, Hammer  
Now can I kick it, of course I can  
yo, you will get burned out, then turned out  
I'm gonna keep comin strong, song after song  
Ya thought I'd fade, well ya did wrong  
I'm the imperial threat for this sound fools  
Ha Ha, here comes the lyrical beatdown

[Verse 1]  
I Remember way back when  
Lookin' for the right girl to be my friend  
I searched and searched but still never came up  
On the right one who would be mine and the only one  
Luck never came my way  
And all I ever came up with is a broken heart ya see  
I couldn't stand to be alone why my boys  
Straight kick it with the betties while I sat by the telephone  
Everytime I hear it rang it wasn't who I want it to be  
It was just the same ol' thing, Another day another heartache  
No pain, no gain, just Lookin' for a good thing  
Momma use to say don't look for love  
Just let it come around and surely one day it'll be found  
Ya see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
I go down, I go down, I go down baby, I go down  
I go down, I go down baby doll, I go down  
[Verse 2]  
Step up if ya think ya out there  
I know it's gotta be a tender  
Who'll remember Ice somewhere  
That's only if you're ready for a real one  
I need a tender and yeah I gotta feel one  
I want to tease and please  
And do it all with ease  
But ya gotta be right and all that  
There when I need ya perfect like Kodak  
Picture perfect body like an hour glass figure  
Cool in tha head and I gotta dig her  
The type that never says no  
Cause she's down to the fullest, Cool like the wind blows  
And I ain't trying' to search and find  
I guess it's true when they say that love is blind  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down  
[Verse 3]  
Now I'm on tour and got the past behind me  
But I need something to remind me  
Of the days when I played the kissing game  
But now things changed and no I ain't the same  
I made a come up, and now they run up  
They all scream I'm the one, That wants to give the love up  
But ICE ain't got no time for games  
I need a real love, Like Mary J. Blige know what I'm sayin  
But the odds are still against me, I'm making paper  
And still need that one, That wants to be with me  
And not for the money, Nor the fame, But for me  
One who can give me that security  
So if you're out there this one's for you  
You'll be down with me, then maybe I'll be true  
You see I'm kinda like 2 Pac, When I get around  
But the ICE goes down

[Verse 1]  
Girl, I keep thinkin' of how I feel  
When I'm in your arms gives me a chill  
Just knowin' that you want me by your side  
Mellows my mind and enhances my pride  
Girl, I need you more and more each day  
Believe me when I tell you I'm here to stay  
I'm captured by your love and your pretty smile  
You devastating beauty and your sweet profile  
[Chorus]  
I love you, cause I love you  
I love you, cause I love you  
[Verse 2]  
You're so fine, let's wine and dine  
I'm so happy that you are mine  
Thinking of you I melt with desire  
Take you in my arms, let love take us higher  
To hear you talk, sounds so sweet  
When you're close to me I feel your heat  
Girl, I want you and you want me  
And it'll last until eternity  
You're like the snow fallin' from the sky  
So clean, like the look in your eye  
You're my queen, i'll buy you everything  
Yes, girl, even diamond rings  
Cause you're my lady, and this love is true  
Every sunset makes me think of you  
And i'll never forget what you mean to me  
Comin' straight from the heart of vanilla i-see-e  
Chorus  
[Outro]  
Hello girl, when I first saw you. it was love at first sight  
We've been goin' out now for about two years and I still feel the same  
I know I haven't said it much before...well...it's because  
See, I get all choked up inside. it just doesn't want to  
Come out. I don't know. maybe this'll help all the bad  
Things i've done. so, no matter what goes on, no matter  
What happens, always remember...I love you!

Shaggy 2 Dope--

My name's Violent J but you can call me syphillis  
Gonorrhea the clap cause I infected this rap  
You wanna know if I could ever kill somebody  
Well that's like askin Charlie Manson if he's ever been in jail  
I kill family, friends, myself  
What, yeah, I'd kill myself if I could only survive  
I tried to kill Rob Van Winkle, in fact that's how we met  
I went up to kill him and he was thinkin the same shit  
I pulled out a chainsaw, he pulled out and ax  
I was like come-on, wait is that a Stanley, where'd you get that  
It's natural and to murder, you gotta have it in you  
It's like a dick all up in you, although I wouldn't now  
Look at us natural killas

And the most hated group together like woooo!  
Chorus--

Remember me  
The V I see E  
Well here's my trilogy  
I'm outta captivity  
Rap cujo ya know my flow is ferocious  
Last survivor with a mouth full of cockroaches  
I bring this hocus pocus  
You're flying away  
Like the last days of the motherfuckin loafers  
I'm the redneck in the moshpit  
2 axes come in handy  
To answer Violent J, ya damn right its a stanley  
In the shadows of the dark with darkman like spawn  
In the dash blazin it up with explosive bombs  
I spit homicides like major cities at 11PM  
While zipping bodies in the dungeon like the line at GM  
Ice mixed with blood is the killers milkshake  
Here with the clowns from the underground it's a lyrical deathbreak  
Chorus--  
Mass murders  
Natural born killas  
I'm not fuckin around  
Icky icky ya ya

Mass murders

Darkman--  
Disrespect me I'll run in your house  
Like puffin steam stout  
Break both your arms, gun in your mouth  
Knock your teeth out with the nose of the fifth  
Bullets bust through the back of your head ya die swift  
Fuckin wit tha clan, watch what you say  
We kill niggas like the KKK  
Shoot you with an SK or a AK bitch you gonna die either way  
I'm a monster thoroughbred gun holding weed-head  
Cross me bet tomorrow you'll be dead  
Catch you at a show while you're chilling with your ho  
And crack your skull with a bottle of Mo  
I'm a Sing-Sing killer  
Gun groove captain  
Brooklyn home of the original gun clapping  
Gats get brung, niggas get done  
Sons lose fathers and mothers lose sons  
I'm a killer  
Chorus--  
Mass murders  
Natural born killas

Icky icky ya ya

Icky icky ya ya  
Icky icky ya ya  
(Screams)  
OVERDUB: To die is a fate that must come to us all  
But how horrible to be buried alive  
From the darkness they shuffle eyes glazed with death  
Hands clawing for blood!  
Chorus--  
Mass murders  
Natural born killas  
I'm not fuckin around  
Icky icky ya ya  
Icky icky ya ya  
Mass murders  
Natural born killas

Icky icky ya ya

[Intro]  
Yea...vanillas' stand the world on a chair, yea!  
Vanilla 'll knock 'em down on their rear, yea!  
Vanilla 'll make 'em all stand up and cheer, yea!  
He's the vanilla! break, break, break down  
[Verse 1]  
Sparklin' like a towerin' inferno  
You want to' learn my songs, this ain't no journal  
It blemished my rhyme, because I'm drawin' the line  
Don't celebrate too soon, 'cause I'm goin' for mine  
Just a character in a made up cartoon  
Like witchel and hazel, boy, you're pushin' a broom  
So get a new life or come equipped with the best  
Mark another one for ice, let the microphone rest  
Just listen to my groove, the beat is strong  
And i'll rock it now, I need a microphone  
I'm in the mood to dance, I'm in the mood to prance  
You tried me once but now you're takin' a chance  
Because I rock with flavor, hard as lifesaver  
You asked for dope, ha...that's what I gave ya'  
A chance to go but now you move too slow  
My juice is pumped and I'm ready to go  
[Chorus]  
Go...it's a party...come on...let's do this...come on..  
[Verse 2]  
Real good...into a new phase, jumpin' up the airwaves  
And now you're amazed 'cause it's hip hop that you crave  
because I'm hyped like an addict, there's no drug involved  
The only thing I need is my record revolved  
Def comin' strong, hard like a matador  
I saw my style, my soul, up on the dance floor  
I want to' see ya' shake, shake and shiver  
You're a charity case, and ice is the giver  
I'm givin' you what you want but you're dumb and naive  
You can't cope with the dop ice has concieved  
Which is a dope jam, hotter than the third degree  
You tried my style but I burn you see  
I'm ice and I'm cold, I'm buildin' igloos of gold  
You want to' bite my style, you gotta' have soul  
'cause a dope like this is not easy to come by  
You don't buy it on, it comes out your hi-fi  
[Chorus]  
It's a party...come on...'let's do this..  
[Verse 3]  
You think it's funy to lack but I'm a brother to mack  
The 808 kickin' base from a dope drum track  
I'm the coolest of cool, kickin' cools silly fools  
You are posse's takin' a dip and vanilla's the pool  
Get ready for my ritual, it's at its' peak  
Silly punks bow down 1st the lyricist speak  
Intruders get slayed, my pockets get paid  
The girlie is jockin' it and just got laid  
See I'm the press you elect, keep the record erect  
In effect, damn, ain't that what you expect?  
Earthquake is on the funk, my homie's not a punk  
Take you antique rhymes and self 'em as junk  
You see, we won't come front' and sellin' drugs and all that shit  
Fake caddies, mack daddies, ain't even legit  
So, get a beeper, you're a sleeper and you need to wake up  
So make the record transform so carwin vegas  
[Chorus]  
It's a party...come on...let's do this..  
[Outro]  
Do it! we don't need no music  
Cause all we want to' do, is sing and dance and party down  
I'm the best, he's the vanilla  
[Chorus]  
It's a party...come on...let's do this..

Here it is, a dope hit, Iceman comin' with a dope hit  
Cause a few suckers need their throats slit  
Jealous cause I went multi platinum  
Now I'm gonna blast you in the head  
Till you're dead with my magnum  
Lyrics might be simplistic, but I'm no simp  
On the strip, cause I know how to pimp it  
Now I got grip and suckers keep sinking  
In my quicksand, Vanilla Ice, vocal hitman  
Got the number three in my crosses, sittin' on the rooftop  
Bop bop bop  
And you fools drop, Was a big fl-fl-flop flop  
Brother's didn't like your record 'cause it wasn't hip hop hop  
But this ain't a dis 'cause you sold gold  
Still, I made a killin' and it ain't even a ten eleven million  
Given my rhyming spice while my DJ's on the slice  
Vanilla Ice is back on the map, with the wrath of the Ice king  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Why does my man try to run my actions?  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Now why does my man try to run my actions?  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] my living condition  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] it's my living condition  
Etch on a sketch on a rhyme like an architect  
Now watch your back son, cause you might lose your neck  
Pound for pound, I rock the ground I stand on  
I rock records, every record at random  
Flyin' heads, as the heads get full  
[Incomprehensible] speakers get ripped and torn  
To my tomb  
I'm wicked as a witch on a broom stick  
I smash bricks with one lick  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Why does my man try to run my actions?  
Why is that I disperse?  
Why does God shun?  
Now why does my man try to run my actions?  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] my living condition  
My living condition  
[Incomprehensible] it's my living condition  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
[Incomprehensible]  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
No one will stop me  
You don't get a second chance  
(No one will stop me)  
Cause and tremors bring the scales in hand  
Call the cops, the paramedics, the man's down  
(No one will stop me)  
You wanna rock my bell so I broke them down  
My tongue snapped and cracked like a bull whip  
(No one will stop me)  
And you ain't nothing but my itty bitty target  
And as I walk through the valley of sin  
(No one will stop me)  
I walk with all you my friends  

[Verse 1]  
Crank it up, yo, and let me hear that system bump  
'cause with this here I gotta get over the hump  
And you know what that means (that means)  
Kickin' out funky rhymes "G" (rhymes "G")  
I got the funky rhymes that'll please (that'll please)  
And my jams break overseas (overseas)  
So when I come to town be prepared to be hyped up  
'cause when the mic's turned on I get psyched up (psyched up)  
The V.I.P. gets it started with intro  
Bustin' smooth moves on top of instrumental  
Turn up the beats in the Jeeps louder  
Here we go y'all - with minutes of power  
Minutes of power  
[Verse 2]  
Minutes of power  
When I step to the mic - bro  
Vanilla Ice does it right  
And what I'm sayin' is - Yo!  
Ya suckers frontin' what ya wantin' is for me to fade  
Thought I was outta here fools  
I ain't goin' away  
Back with the track that will keep my bank fat  
HA! Vanilla's got the flavor for the funky format  
And if you're not givin' up the credit I seek  
VIP's in the house and they're ready to creep  
Now whatcha gonna do when my boys are on you?  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
So turn it up for the passengers - LOUDER!  
It's Vanilla Killa with the Minutes of Power  
[Verse 3]  
Walk through the smoke on the stage  
And the girls scream  
Ice gets 'em hot, then they melt like ice cream  
Flowin' with the swiftness  
Kickin' it with the quickness  
Fella's gettin jealous cause their girlies want a quick kiss  
When I'm rolllin' around in my 5.0 drop top  
Turning up the sounds  
'cause I want to bump the hip hop  
People gettin' mad 'cause they hear the big bass hit  
I turn it up more just to let cha know I won't quit  
Ice has got it locked down and there's no stoppin' it  
When I hear a track like this  
You know that I'll be rocking it  
Sounds so sweet, it could never be sour  
Here we go y'all with the  
M.......minutes of power  
[Verse 4]  
Now's the time for the Ice to let a rhyme rip  
Loadin' up my lyrics with a 9 double M clip  
Shootin' all enemies, you're not even a friend of me  
I ain't Spike Lee so I do the wrong thing, G  
So down with Luther Campbell OH NO  
I don't think so  
Travel state to state an' and the Ice man rips shows  
Steppin' in my path an' you might get broken  
I got it goin' on an' you know I ain't jokin  
Power every hour an' the Ice keeps risin  
Sellin' out arenas so don't look surprised  
When Vanilla shows up an' the place explodes  
An' if ya missed it - catch the next episode!  
Gather up your troops  
Rush 'em to the record store  
An' pick up the new LP from the Ice Man  
So let the funk flow louder  
And let me hit cha - hit cha - hit cha  
With the, with the  
Minutes (x3) Minutes of Power

Guess who's back.....  
Chorus:  
OKS original killa shit that'll leave yo wrists slit  
OKS niggas with the biscuits mobbin through your district splifted on some
sick shit  
Raisin' up from my tomb  
Time warp on a dime off the shrooms  
Zoom in let me take your mind on a journey  
See what I see visions of bodies burnin'  
Like turnin a pistol and pointin it to your dome  
Cock it back squeeze the trigger blow and it's on  
Brains gone, thrown out the back of your cranium  
Trippin' on your shorts, left your ass a corpse on your Ma's front porch  
About to torch down the house  
Caught your mama and her spouse fuckin on the couch like south  
Bout to make moves off your fam bam  
Madman lyrically from rap to seran next plan  
Let me expand on my artwork genius in my reality  
Pure insanity can it be the angel dust that turns your brains to dust  
Bust lyrics strangle us no one is insane as us  
Chorus:  
OKS original killa shit that'll leave yo wrists slit  
OKS niggas with the biscuits mobbin through your district splifted on some
sick shit  
Takin puffs on the smoke I call the Anti-Christ  
Got me seein red and purple lights  
Mixed with black dots  
Peep the backdrop of the crime scene  
Niggas seein' 19 I'm seein' widescreen  
So much red Visine can't get it out  
From the rage of the slugs as the iron spit it out  
It is I Psycho palmin' the Desert Eagle  
Creepin' through your blocks in the crypt colored Reagal  
Pure evil bumpin brother Lynch season of the sick  
How you gonna reason with the Psycho I'm the desolate  
Watch the devil spit, call the exorcist  
Satanic messages, got me wearin nigases for necklaces  
Yes it is the messenger of death watch yo step  
I'm quite wicked  
Make a motherfucker leak his life liquid  
So why risk it it's a suicide  
When it comes to you and I  
Do or fly nigga you will die  

Play that funky music  
Play that funky music, white boy  
Play that funky music  
Play that funky music, white boy  
  
I'm back and I'm ringin' the bell  
A rockin' on the mike while the fly girls yell  
In ecstasy in the back of me  
Well that's my DJ Deshay cuttin' all them Z's  
Hittin' hard and the girlies goin' crazy  
Vanilla's on the mike, man I'm not lazy.  
  
I'm lettin' my drug kick in  
It controls my mouth and I begin  
To just let it flow, let my concepts go  
My posse's to the side yellin', Go Vanilla Go!  
  
Smooth 'cause that's the way I will be  
And if you don't give a damn, then  
Why you starin' at me  
So get off 'cause I control the stage  
There's no dissin' allowed

The girlies sa y they love me and that is ok  
And I can dance better than any kid n' play

So I can funk it up and make it sound good  
1-2-3 Yo -- Knock on some wood  
For good luck, I like my rhymes atrocious  
Supercalafragilisticexpialidocious  
I'm an effect and that you can bet  
I can take a fly girl and make her wet.  
  
I'm like Samson -- Samson to Delilah  
There's no denyin', You can try to hang  
But you'll keep tryin' to get my style  
Over and over, practice makes perfect  
But not if you're a loafer.  
  
You'll get nowhere, no place, no time, no girls  
Soon -- Oh my God, homebody, you probably eat  
Spaghetti with a spoon! Come on and say it!

Intoxicating so you stagger like a wino  
So punks stop trying and girl stop cryin'  
Vanilla Ice is sellin' and you people are buyin'  
'Cause why the freaks are jockin' like Crazy Glue  
Movin' and groovin' trying to sing along  
All through the ghetto groovin' this here song  
Now you're amazed by the VIP posse.  
  
Steppin' so hard like a German Nazi  
Startled by the bases hittin' ground  
There's no trippin' on mine, I'm just gettin' down  
Sparkamatic, I'm hangin' tight like a fanatic  
You trapped me once and I thought that  
You might have it  
So step down and lend me your ear

You're weakenin' fast, YO! and I can tell it  
Your body's gettin' hot, so, so I can smell it  
So don't be mad and don't be sad  
'Cause the lyrics belong to ICE, You can call me Dad  
You're pitchin' a fit, so step back and endure  
Let the witch doctor, Ice, do the dance to cure  
So come up close and don't be square  
You wanna battle me -- Anytime, anywhere  
  
You thought that I was weak, Boy, you're dead wrong  
So come on, everybody and sing this song  
  
Say -- Play that funky music Say, go white boy, go white boy go

[Verse 1]  
Stop as I drop this bomb  
Blow up this place like another vietnam  
I'm heavy like a holyfield blow to the dome  
Back up son, now give me room, give me room  
I set it off like this, don't give it up (uh)  
I'm all up in you till you just can't get enough  
I'm real hard to the bone you want more  
I sneak up on you like a sniper at your back door  
Phat flavor for your brain you know the time  
So check the wrath it's for real cause I'm gonna get mine  
I roll up on you like eastwood  
I'm blowing up fifteens as I'm riding through your neighborhood  
I spreads butter like parkay  
Real smooth with the flow and even when I parlay  
Do what you feel and check the skill  
I'm in your grill, peep this - I got the raw deal  
And in your jeep cherokee or land cruiser  
When you're rolling through the hood I know you're gonna use a  
Track like this all up in your eardrum  
So pump the e.q. and let the speakers hum  
[Chorus]  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
We gets crazy like prozac  
Hype enough to start a party and illy have a heart attack  
[Verse 2]  
Go and check it I think it's time to wreck it  
Here I come again with my stuff, so let's test it  
I'm cool like the ice, or vanilla, hear my flavor  
Freezin up the mic, I hit you with somethin you can savor  
No slippin, no stonin, I am gettin to the point  
So hit the mad ism and light another joint  
The easy like stylist with a kick when I'm kicking  
No tripping, I'm hitting, so get a good grip in  
Get with a style I be using, and there's no dissin  
And here's a quick lesson - I carry a smith and wesson  
Listen up close and there'll be no confusion  
Now you're addicted to mentally abusing  
Word to the mother I'm hear to tear it up  
And if you can't get with it, I don't give a fuck  
So run to your crew and tell them I am hear  
This here is for the people  
[Chorus]  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
It's the funky rhyme killer  
The dope song thriller  
Get your ass back, before you get caps in ya  
[Chorus]

[Chorus 8X]  
Roll 'em up, roll up the hooty mac, rollem up  
Roll 'em up, roll 'em up, roll 'em up..  
[Verse 1]  
I need some herbs and spices  
So I can feel nices  
The breeze, coolin like a summer tree  
Cause it's the I-see-E and you know I got the feel it  
I score it, and I ain't gotta steal it  
So bring on the sack that's phat  
And ya know I love my is izm and the 1.5  
'cause I get with 'em  
Everytime I get a little hit of the ummm  
The skunk, And the funk feels good to my lungs  
Fire, Fire, The izm is my desire  
And I need to get it quick cause it's callin me  
Come and roll me up please I-see-E  
Light the hooty mac, So we can start the par-ty  
You know I smoke good stuff, So go and get the bong  
Bong - Biggedy bong, Once again you know it's on - huh  
You feel it, You feel it, You want it, You want it  
Roll it, Roll it, Lick it - Now hit it  
[Chorus] - 8X  
[Verse 2]  
You see everytime I wake up, I got to clear my head  
But I clear it with cess, Cause it goes with my dreds  
And I can't stand to run out, Cause if you do I get illy  
Never get silly, So pass me the philly  
Blunt, and no I don't front like Zero  
Who wears a chronic hat but always says no  
But I say yes, and I get it off my chest  
Bring the bo, bring the skunk, and I hit the phunky cess  
Check it, You ain't gotta test it  
It's the mad bomb and I've already blessed it  
Checka 1-2, Tell me how ya do  
When you hear the dirty budda when the buzz comes through  
I ain't tryin to front, Cause I'm gettin' what I want  
Take a chunk of the funk, leave the sack in my trunk  
Yeah, You feel it, You feel it, You want it, You want it  
Roll it, Roll it, Lick it - Now hit it  
[Chorus] - 8X  
Roll 'em up the hooty mac, That what I said  
Now tell me how you feelin'  
Don't it feel good enought to jump and touch the ceiling  
It's on, It's on, I feel it comin on  
It's good to the bone, Cause the buzz is real strong  
Even though I can not stand it, But I recommend it  
Especially when ya sick with a cold, so spend it  
You know that twenty dollars that you've saved Throughout the week?  
If you're a non smoker, Then please don't try to speak  
The plan, The plan, Ya know I've got a plan  
Squirrels got the goods, Now tell me who's the man  
But not really the man that you call when you want it  
Ya know I stay legit, and I've got to stay up on it  
On and On Yo, Give me a ho [Ho!]  
And ask me what I want to do, then I'll let you know  
You feel it, you feel it, you want it, you want it  
Roll it, roll it, lick it - now hit it  
[Chorus] - 8X

[Intro]  
Strictly from the islands, vanilla ice  
The man jam down reggae music  
Mash it up ice, mash it  
[Verse 1]  
I got the rhyme to keep the body pumpin'  
Turn the party out while the people are jumpin'  
Reggae style at the top of my list  
Is hitting real hard like mike tyson's fist  
It is so good that the girlies goin' crazy  
Vanilla's on the mic and you know I'm not lazy  
I'm pumpin' up the lyrics in a smooth way  
I drop 'em like a bum rush much as what we say  
The other mc's try to duplicate  
But with the rosta man they just mediate  
[Chorus]  
Rosta man you be jammin' so smooth  
You rockin' on the mic and you can only improve  
Rosta man you know you sound so sweet  
I like the way you put the lyrics to the funky beat  
Ah rae rue, re rae rah  
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away  
Ah rae rue, re rae rah  
Reggae rock has the style to chase the blues away  
[Verse 2]  
Me and i, myself and you  
The rosta man, deshay and the rest of my crew  
Reggae music's been around for a while  
Vanilla ice is doin' it the hip hop style  
Because this is the one that we call the rae rue  
Everybody out there you know just what to do  
Just clap your hands and stomp your feet  
Move around to the sound of the reggae beat  
No push, no fall, no shove, no trip  
The rosta man wants you to get with it  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
Well the people out there let me hear you scream  
If you want to get down and you want to be seen  
Then jump up my man, do the rosta man  
Move your head up and down to the reggae jam  
Just shake your arms and move your hips  
All you females out there let me shake your  
And just get down like you're makin' love  
All you people who believe in god above  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 4]  
From the ah rae rue, the re rae rah  
The jack tar village in jamaica  
Ocho rios or the way to kingston  
If we go back to the homeland again  
Back on tour from city to city  
Rollin' with the girls with the big, big ahhh..  
Pity the fool who step it to me  
I drop 'em like a fly, I better get the flea  
[Chorus]

[Verse 1]  
Saturday night, The club was packed, But I can't get no action  
The girl I want is frontin hard, I can't get no satisfaction  
Thousand people up in the club and the music's thumpin hard  
I must admit that I was slightly anxious to have my card  
Pooled by a girl in a nice tight dress  
The kind that makes ya body wet, Hmm, I must confess  
I tryed and she said no, But fellas yo, I can't get no  
[Chorus]  
I can't get no [Yeah]  
I can't get no [Ya know what I'm sayin?]  
I can't get no [Yep, Yep]  
Satisfaction, Ah hey hey hey  
You know what I say  
That's what I say  
Yeah  
[Verse 2]  
Girlie at the bar, Lookin mighty fly  
She look so fly at the time  
I had to make up, You know, My mind  
So I walked up to her gently, Just so I can speak  
Man, she turned around and scoped me down and started doin the freak  
I tryed all I could, I even said please  
She moved my hands off her booty, Cause she was a skeeze  
Man, I had to escape, So I could get away  
I told her what was up, She said come back another day  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3]  
The party's almost over, The club's about to close  
I saw this girl who rocked my world, So I suppose  
I'll take another chance, A try at romance  
I couldn't take my eyes off the back of her pants  
I moved very smoothly, A nice conversation  
The perfume she was wearing, Ooh, Sensation!  
She seemed kinda worried, Like something was wrong  
Tyson at my back, I had to move along  
[Chorus]  
[Repeat chorus till fade]

1,2,3,4  
It was an average night backstage at a show  
I seen this girlie that I knew, she was a cutie and Yo!  
She had it goin' on from her head to her feet  
Her shape was so petite, and so unique  
Her eyes flamed with passion like she was possessed  
As I shivered and quivered while she rubbed on my chest  
'Slaved and engraved I couldn't scream  
Moaning and groaning like she could take on the A-Team  
I was one of many that she'd choose  
Do me, pursue me, twice as nice but don't refuse  
Leaving her breathless as the sweat poured on  
The spot that I was in was so soft and warm  
This was far from a story you will find in a book  
Hot off the platter, and boy, could she cook  
Roastin' my body it left a stain in my brain  
And all I kept sayin' to myself was  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Oh my God, what have I got into?  
Sooner or later I thought she'd get the clue  
'Cause my body was tired and full of sweat and perspire  
The situation I was in could've started a campfire  
No more skeezin' and teasin' for the Ice right now  
I found me a corner, play it cool for a while  
Just mackin' and schemin' on a woman I thought was cool  
But now I realize that the Ice was the fool  
'Cause a woman will play you, lay you and obey you  
You better watch your back 'cause a woman will slay you  
Not to mention the one who got me  
Yea, she got me, the I-see-E  
But, back to the story of a one night stand  
I thought I was strong but she was He-man  
Lovin' every second tryin' to make me blush  
And all 'n all it was for the lust  
I though, she was an angel and soft as a cream puff  
Until I seen her come out with the whip and handcuffs  
Breathin' down my neck I was scared to death  
The sweat from my body as it rolls down my neck  
And out of all nights, where was my crew?  
'Cause this was somethin' I didn't know what to do  
D already told me that the girlie was strange  
But I didn't know until she pulled out the chains  
Walkin' and stalkin' towards me with a plan  
And now I regret all the things I was sayin'  
Now the moment is critical, so what should I do?  
Leave while I can, or just take the abuse  
Now I'm drippin' with sweat, Why? 'Cause I'm afraid  
Handcuffs and chains is a game I don't play  
No doubt in my mind that the girlie is the boss  
Stop this train 'cause I want to get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Later on that night as it got worse  
My body's steamin' up and I was ready to burst  
She had me hot as a skillet taken from a flame  
And my admission was free for me to ride on this train  
Yea, I must admit to myself, it was fun  
But, now I'm lookin' for my shoes, I'm ready to run  
So, now I'm hopin' and prayin' for the moment to come  
'Cause I couldn't move and my body was numb  
So, now what have I done to get myself into this?  
It started from a kiss, now I'm ready to resist  
I couldn't take it no more, on the bed, or the floor  
My knees were gettin' weak and my back was gettin' sore  
The room was destroyed, not to mention my body  
Why did I ever tell her to "Pump it, Hottie?"  
What could I do to just ease the pain?  
I think I'll let the hook just try to explain  
Stop that train, I want to' get off  
Stop that train, I want to' get off

Now here's a Zig Zag story while I'm writing this song  
Sit back relax I'm igniting this bong  
Picture this sandy beaches dimes wearin thongs  
Serving mixed drinks to me all night long  
With me feet back puffin on my weed sack  
Shit you can't believe that people ask me  
Where you buy your trees at  
Got the Bombay Ganje lime green  
Sticky icky Ganja got me needing Visine  
  
Like a magic carpet ride come fly with me  
And this is for my homies that get high with me  
Just crack the Phillie open cause we keep on smoking  
  
Dimes rubbin on lotion  
Feet soaking in the ocean  
On a tropical Island staying sunny  
We outta Phillies take these skins somebody roll a Mummy  
Now people say money makes the world go round  
  
So come escape with me and let's puff on a pound.  
  
Chorus:  
So high fly through the sky  
And ride my life high  
Fly through the sky  
  
  
No matter what you say  
Feeling so alright so Ire today  
Fire de go blaze  
No responsibility man  
  
No responsible  
Me I go rolling a fat blunt  
Smoking the fat blunt  
This is my goal.  
  
Take it easy Rastaman  
  
I will now go blaze  
From Kingston Jamaica  
  
Bombay to India  
Smoking in the air  
What da da da day  
Some of them are smoking  
Weed to take away frustration  
I and I do it for me aggravation  
Dreadlock to Babylon are selling everyday  
Come me say  
Bringing it back on the boat back to the USA  
With the ganja me floating me floating away  
  
Why not come and puff with me and then we go fly away  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
Well it's the sticky icky bomb Holmes  
Got the fat sacks puffier than Sean Combs  
It's the Ice man back blowin dookie out the nostrils  
In the studio creating shit that's colossal  
Apostle of the green bud see me bleemed up  
In my 430 Lexus off in Texas teamed up  
With the Darkman and we're blazing  
Some headbanging shit yo the Ice'll come equipped  
  
To spit with the best cause I'm all about mine  
I got dimes of smoke that'll make you float on cloud nine  
  
Then I shine just like a beacon in the night  
Pass me the Thai I get high on the mic  
For real a zig zag story for my peeps  
Bangin in the Jeeps while you slang it in the streets  
Like Napalm I'm way gone and now it's time to bounce  
  
It's the weed song come with me and smoke an ounce  
  
Chorus repeat  
  
  

[Chorus]  
Darkman  
V-Ice  
Trust me ain't nothing nice  
Hardcore  
My dog's unbreakable like dice  
Hardcore  
My dog's unbreakable like dice  
Hardcore  
My dog's unbreakable like dice  
  
[Verse 1: La the Darkman]  
I've been in bloody pictures  
Ill as Hitler back in Germany  
Kid's think they're burning me  
You really ain't concerning me  
King be hold a Mack 8 plus 3  
And I draw rhymes fast as Zorro draw that Z  
Draw guns - fast as white boys on TV  
You can't fuck with me! Trapper conti  
Warfare my clan specialize in putting cats in  
wheelchairs  
Pack a .38 Snubnose name brand clothes  
What's money to my clan was death to my foes  
That's how it goes, My Niggaz is gung-ho  
God advocates sniping weak rappers with a crossbow  
Stay on the low with a M-16 flow  
In the Benz with a dime bitch, puffin hydro  
I'm CEO you're TKO, John Doe  
My raps is like cheap keys straight from Mexico  
Yo, I flow like a UFO, All-Pro  
Rich kid, get my dick sucked in a Tahoe  
When I hear a beat it's like putting tims on my feet  
Then run a track meet away from the beats, fuck police  
I run the street with a Mack Milli for rappers who act silly  
Cock it back, then smoke a Nigga like a Philly  
  
[Chorus] - repeat  
[Verse 2: Vanilla Ice]  
I draw my rhymes like a bow  
Shoot 'em out like an arrow  
Swooping on suckers like an eagle, not a sparrow  
walk a wide path, never ever walk it narrow  
Step on stage with funky hip-hop apparel  
Got the funky rhymes sometimes they leave you scared bro  
It's like looking down a shotgun barrel  
Hardcore  
Runs through my veins like cocaine  
V-Ice, In your brains like bloodstains  
Psycho!  
When I step to the mic, bro  
You know the Ice'll do it right, what I'm saying is "Yo"  
Suckers fronting what you wantin is for me to fade!  
Thought I was outta here, I ain't going away!  
Back with the track, I keep my bank fat  
You know I got the flavor for the funky format  
You're not giving up, the credit I seek  
Darkman's in the house he's ready to creep  
Now what you gonna do  
When my boys are on you  
You know a hard head makes for a soft shoe  
Now crank it up for your passenger - LOUDER  
Cause it's the thrilla killa, I bring this hardcore hour  
  
[Chorus] - repeat  
[Chorus] - repeat
