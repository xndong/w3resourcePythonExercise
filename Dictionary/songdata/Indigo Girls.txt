A hard knock  
A cold clock  
Ticking off my time  
A long look  
But no luck  
Couldn't seem to find  
Or unwind  
Into peace of mind  
Though I was trying  
  
A quick glance  
A big chance  
My heart beat like a drum  
I saw you  
And I knew  
Chances just don't come  
Round again  
Not like this  
First a laugh  
Then the kiss  
  
And I'm free in you  
I've got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
  
The lost time  
The self crime  
My big mistakes  
The clear voice  
Of bad choice  
Sounding like an ache  
In my day  
Not too bad  
But too real  
To go away  
  
But now I'm free in you  
I got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
  
And I don't know  
How you show  
Such gentle disregard  
For the ugly in me  
That I see  
That for so long  
I took so hard  
(i took so hard)  
But I truly believe  
(i truly believe)  
That you see the best in me  
(that you see the best in me)  
I'm enough  
For your love  
(enough for your love)  
And the thought  
Sets me free  
(and I'm free)  
Free in you  
Got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
Yes I'm free  
In you

I wasn't looking to shift my direction  
My eyes straight ahead hands ten and two  
The gravity of our first connection  
Veering off the road and into you  
All the people drive by slowly gawking at the scene  
Of the smoldering inevitable spark and gasoline  
All the way I met you head on full speed  
At the heart the blue flame burns  
All the way I took the crash course impact  
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn  
No amount of playing safe could save me from this day  
The head seeking path of my trajectory  
Didn't we cooly divest of predestination  
Slamming into futures we can't see  
I know what can happen when there's more than meets the eye  
But there's no way to avoid it just get in the car and drive  
All the way I met you head on full speed  
At the heart the blue flame burns  
All the way I took crash course impact  
But have I learned all that I'm supposed to learn  
It makes me laugh, we?re talking over tea  
When I can still smell the smoke on my sleeve  
Steaming like gun smoke the wreckage of our past  
The scene of a crime I still can't leave  
Oh you and me, we should let well enough be  
But each revisitation points to clues  
There's the oil slick of uncertainty  
And warning signs back there we didn't use  
At least we laugh about it now how we escaped alive  
It's remarkable the mess we make and what we can survive  
(repeat chorus)  

"American Tune" is a Paul Simon song. The girls have been performing  
It since at least 1985. A live version of it appears on the  
(promo-only) "Reverse 1" CD, and another on the (commercially  
Available, but kinda hard to find) "Ben and Jerry's Newport Folk  
Festival '90" CD.  
Many is the time I've been mistaken  
And many times confused  
Yes, and I've often felt forsaken  
And certainly misused.  
Oh, but I'm all right, I'm all right  
I'm just weary to my bones  
Still, you don't expect to be bright and bon vivant  
So far away from home - so far away from home.  
I don't know a soul who's not been battered  
I don't have a friend who feels at ease  
I don't know a dream that's not been shattered  
Or driven to it's knees  
Oh, but it's all right, it's all right  
We've lived so well, so long  
Still, when I think of the road we're travelling on  
I wonder what's gone wrong  
I can't help it, I wonder what's gone wrong.  
And I dreamed I was dying  
Dreamed that my soul rose unexpectedly  
And looking back down at me  
Smiled reassuringly  
And I dreamed I was flying  
And high up above, my eyes could clearly see  
The Statue of Liberty sailing away to sea  
And I dreamed I was dying.  
Oh, we come on a ship they called the Mayflower  
We come on a ship that sailed the moon  
We come in the age's most uncertain hour  
And sing an American tune  
Oh, oh, but it's all right - it's all right, it's all right  
You can't be forever blessed  
Still, tomorrow's going to be another working day  
And I'm trying to get some rest  
That's all I'm trying - to get some rest  

Andy  
Do you love me  
Do you think about it  
Will you say  
Turning brushwood  
Into blazes  
Turning summer grass  
Into hay  
Turning sharply  
Past the graveyard  
To the lakefront  
With the black waves  
Licking up the stones  
To the swayed back  
Screened in front porch  
Who could ever stay the weight  
Of flesh and bones  
  
Andy  
Aren't you tired  
From the sun and rain  
And river soaking you  
From the beer cans  
On your dashboard  
And the bullet hole  
Glass spiderweb  
Staining your rear view  
I have watched you  
Watch an empty road  
Is it only her  
Upon which you all  
Of you is depending  
To fill your twenty  
Hour work day  
While all the fences  
In this county still need mending  
Hey  
  
And in the night  
I do my checking  
And fix the broken parts  
With visions of rare beauty  
But in my heart I know I'm second  
Forever fixed in your pursuit  
It is my duty  
Hey  
  
Andy  
Will you toss me  
A little scrap of something  
That I can taste  
Instead of dust from  
All the leaving  
And the smell of summer  
Lying here to waste  
Under the burnt pyre  
Of all the cast away  
The tiny shoots will spring  
Like questions  
Will you take me  
Out to the fenced hill  
Sprinkled with horses  
Wild in resistance to the taming  
Will you break me  
Will you break me

I'm just a bartender  
I don't like my work  
I don't mind the money at all  
I see lots of sad faces  
And lots of bad cases  
Of folks with their backs to the wall  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away  
  
I can light up your smokes  
And Ill laugh at your jokes  
And Ill watch you fall down on your knees  
Close down this bar  
Gas up my car  
Pack up and mail in my key  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going a-stray  
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away  
  
The smoke fills the air  
In this honky-tonk bar  
And I'm thinking about where Id rather be  
Yeah  
But I sunk all my bridges  
I burned all my boats  
I'm stranded at the edge of the sea  
Yeah  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away  
  
I need four walls around me to hold my life  
To keep me from going astray  
A honky-tonk angel to hold me tight  
To keep me from slipping away

I heard you sing a rebel song  
Sung it loud and all alone  
We can't afford the things you save  
We can't afford the warranty  
  
Well I see you walking in the glare  
Down the county road we share  
Our southern blood my heresy  
Damn that ol' confederacy  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you won't  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
I'm sorry for what you've learned  
(learned)  
When you feel the tables turn  
To run so hard in your race  
(race)  
Now you found who set the pace  
  
The landed aristocracy  
Exploiting all your enmity  
All your daddies fought in vain  
Leave you with the mark of Cain  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you won't  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you  
  
The center holds so they say  
(it never held too well for me)  
It never held too well for me  
(the center holds so they say)  
I won't stop short for common ground  
(that vilifies the trodden down)  
That vilifies the trodden down  
(i won't stop)  
  
The center held the bonded slave  
For the sake of industry  
(ah)  
The center held the bloody hand  
Of the executioner man  
(ah)  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become the thing  
I am to you  
And you won't  
Tear it apart  
Without a fight  
Without a heart  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you  
  
It took a  
Long time to  
Become you  
Become you

I called you up today to bridge my sorrow  
Carry me over the line to you  
How long will it take to reach tomorrow  
Seems like a whole lot of time  
Just these thoughts to pull me through  
  
I see blue carpet and cold moonlight settled in  
Voices whisper doubts of how I should have been  
I feel like Im over the water  
But Im caught in the tide  
Tell are you calling for me  
Does this come deep from inside  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
  
The sound slowly fades and trickles away from the sea  
Its only the windows and i  
They hear my dream  
Im walking a distance I feel Ive been running for miles  
Happy times dont last long  
I finally got that its too late to smile  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Over the mind  
Carry me away  
Under the water  
Into your mind

Laughing in a crown of jewels,  
Numbness from a sceptors wound.  
Toss and Turn, I spin and learn,  
"Catch yourself before you burn."  
A joker's dance before the king,  
Jangling beads, a silver ring.  
Close your eyes and bare the sound,  
Jumping up, falling down.  
  
Falling, falling, falling, falling down.  
Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
  
Royal rebels discover you.  
Trust? you turn there is no truth.  
And circle, circle, why are you scared?  
Why a smile instead of tears?  
I'm gulping smoke to fade away.  
Figures floating down to lay.  
Meet the joker and the thief,  
The king and queen but, no relief.  
  
Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.  
Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
  
"the king is in the Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.  
Counting house, Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
Counting out his  
Money"  
  
"the queen is in Falling, Falling, Falling, Falling down.  
Her parlour, eating Look yourself in the eye before you drown.  
Bread and honey"  
  
"Mary had a little lamb"  
  
I cross myself before I die  
The leaping man, he asks me, "why?"  
"well your rhythm is off" I reply,  
"Now you must dance the dance  
That you imply!"  
"Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
Your actions will follow you full circle round,  
The higher the leap, I said

What are we gonna do now?  
Taking off his turban, they said, is this man a jew?  
'cause they're working for the clampdown  
They put up a poster saying we earn more than you!  
When we're working for the clampdown  
We will teach our twisted speech  
To the young believers  
We will train our blue-eyed men  
To be young believers  
  
The judge said five to ten-but I say double that again  
I'm not working for the clampdown  
No man born with a living soul  
Can be working for the clampdown  
Kick over the wall 'cause government's to fall  
How can you refuse it?  
Let fury have the hour, anger can be power  
D'you know that you can use it?  
  
The voices in your head are calling  
Stop wasting your time, there's nothing coming  
Only a fool would think someone could save you  
The men at the factory are old and cunning  
You don't owe nothing, so boy get runnin'  
It's the best years of your life they want to steal  
  
You grow up and you calm down  
You're working for the clampdown  
You start wearing the blue and brown  
You're working for the clampdown  
So you got someone to boss around  
It makes you feel big now  
You drift until you brutalize  
You made your first kill now  
  
In these days of evil presidentes  
Working for the clampdown  
But lately one or two has fully paid their due  
For working for the clampdown  
But ha! gitalong! gitalong!  
  
And I've given away no secrets  
Who's barmy now?  

There on those days when the sun barely touches the sky  
Your eyes are so heavy with the morning  
And there you lie on the horizon of my mind  
Streams flow through the consciousness of time  
And I follow your every movement for a clue to you  
  
You cover my eyes with your deepness  
You wrap my soul in the beauty of it all  
You take me away from my incompleteness  
Lead me all the way or not at all  
And times too precious here  
I can't wait for clues to you  
I can't wait for clues to you  
  
Don't wake me if I'm dreaming, no, no, no, this is my reality  
If I touch you tell me will you blow away  
Please don't move now until you set me free - set me free  
  
I can't wait for clues to you  
  
Name the time and Ill be your place  
Remove my eyes from this deathly haze  
Now I've been living shades of blue and grey  
Don't you know I'm ready for a brighter phase  
And times too precious here  
I can't wait for clues to you  
I can't wait for clues to you  
  
Wont you catch me if I fall too fast  
Don't let me fly too high  
Youve released me from my earthly grasp  
And now youve got me in your skies - in your skies  
  
I can't wait for clues to you  
Now I don't want to wait anymore for clues  
  
Let it rain  
Let it wash on down  
  
Can't wait for clues to you  
I don't want to wait anymore for clues

All of my days have been misspent  
Stuffing out the sofa and the antenna's bent  
Inside my heart's bustin' out at the seams  
I work for the impossible american dream  
  
I got a job at the grocery store  
A few bucks an hour and not much more  
The world comes in just to take things away  
They eat it all up and then they sleep into day  
  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running 'round the same thing time after time  
Only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Now once upon a time I was nobody's fool  
(once upon a fool)  
Two jobs and showing up for school  
I guess it comes apart so little by little  
You don't know your there till your stuck in the middle  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running 'round the same thing time after time  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Sit down  
(sit down sit down)  
The room is dark  
(the room is dark)  
The blurry graffiti on the benches  
Across at the public park  
The plastic's black and buttoned  
(the plastic's black)  
The haze is blue  
(the haze is blue)  
And all I want is nothing to do  
  
'cause it's a long walk to the bus stop  
It's a long wait for the turning clock  
It's a two-tired car sitting up on the blocks  
And things I put aside like that pile of rocks  
  
I try not to care I would lose my mind  
Running 'round the same thing time after time  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
Cold beer and remote control  
  
Yes I try not to care I would lose my mind  
(all of my days have been misspent)  
Running round the same thing time after time  
(stuffing out the sofa and the antennas bent)  
And only two things bound to soothe my soul  
(inside my hearts busting out at the seams)  
Cold beer and remote control  
(i work for the impossible american dream)  
Yeah  
  
Cold beer and remote control  
(i said I guess it comes apart so little by little yeah)  
Yeah  
Beer and remote control  
(i said I guess it comes apart so little by little yeah)  
Yeah

I could paint you in the dark  
Cause I've studied you with hunger  
Like a work of art  
And these are very secret days  
I collect my information  
Then I stowe it all away  
Call me  
When you breeze through  
To your appointments  
The work you do  
Call me  
I'm collecting you  
  
The pleading prayer and hairshirt sting  
My hair-trigger love and faulty spring  
Motivation smokes a name  
I don't like that smile applied to me  
So blindly just the same  
Call me  
When you breeze through  
To your appointments  
The work you do  
Call me  
I'm collecting you  
  
Turning up my collar  
(turning up my collar)  
To an unseasonal chill  
You ask a favor  
You know I will  
And the rain comes a surprise  
We fly across the railroad ties  
I feel the danger  
The foolish thrill  
Oh yes I will  
  
What it will or won't be then  
The shutter pre development of the of the ink full in the pen  
Mind the minds eye's trickery  
Cause you might picture killer beautiful  
Much more than it might be  
Call me  
Tell me  
What you're up to  
What you'll do  
Call me  
I'm collecting you  
  
I would be foolish  
To think that I  
Could turn it off  
And stay alive  
The way I live  
When you switch on  
Hand on the dimmer  
(my hands you)  
Give me just a glimmer  
(in the glimmer)  
Give me just a shadow  
(just a shadow)  
Of hope around the edges  
Agony and rapture  
Forever uncaptured  
  
Take these secrets to your grave  
Drug across your landscape  
And buried in your cave  
(your piling up)  
Your piling up and out of sight  
(out of sight)  
Every try to add it up just feels like counting shades of light  
Call me yeah  
Tell me  
What you're up to  
What you do  
Call me  
I'm collecting you  
  
Hang it in my window  
Let it complicate my view  
The separation  
The glass of you  
But I can paint this picture  
Any way that I see fit  
The art of pain  
The subject sits  
Unmoved

I've come a long way  
I was a show on ice  
Dazzling and brittle  
But subject to the sun  
  
And then one day  
I went little by little  
Back to the water  
The place where I'd come from  
  
And I went under  
Like stones tied in a sack  
And I got emptied  
And started my way back  
  
My name  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
And all my schemes drowned at the seams  
Have left me fine in my own skin  
I've come a long way  
Just to begin  
  
I've come a long way  
Under the cover of darkness  
Trusting a stranger  
A boatman at the shore  
  
The scourge of hope  
The ugly face of danger  
The keepers of the keys  
Had me down on my knees  
In front of the gilded doors  
  
And in a world where every ax was poised to grind  
To find my peace I only held up what was already mine  
  
My name  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
And all my swords have turned to words that blow like poems in the wind  
I've come a long way  
  
I used to be twisted  
When you called it an opiate  
A simple way to cope  
And yet I think you shouldn't skip if you haven't worn the shoes  
  
They start out tight  
And then they hurt your tired feet at night  
But then they give a little day by day  
And then before you know it  
You look back and you've come a long way  
  
It's got your name on it  
My shame  
It's got your name on it  
My home  
It's got your name on it  
Everything I own  
  
You call my name  
My name  
You call my name  
My shame  
You call my name  
My home  
Everything I own  
You call my name  
  
If it's got my name, it's got your name on it  
Everything I own has got your name on it  
When I was trying to cross the river  
You were at the river getting me across and now  
Everything, everything I own  
Has got your name on it  
Oh everything  
I've got your name on it

In the quiet silent seconds I  
I turned off the light switch and I  
I came down to meet you in the  
Half light the moon left while a  
A cluster of night jars sang some  
Songs out of tune  
A mantle of bright light shone  
Down from the room  
  
Come down in time  
I still hear him say  
So clear in my ear  
Like it was today  
Come down in time  
Was the message he gave  
Come down in time and ill  
Meet you half way  
  
Well I don't know if I should have  
Heard him as yet but a  
True love like his is a  
A hard love to get and I've  
Walked most all the way and I  
I aint heard him call and I'm  
Getting to thinking  
If hes coming at all  
  
Come down in time  
I still hear him say  
So clear in my ear  
Like it was today  
Come down in time  
Was the message he gave  
Come down in time and ill  
Meet you half way  
  
There are men and men and  
Some hold you tight while  
Some leave you counting the  
Stars in the night

Dark clouds are comin' like an army  
Soon the sky will open up and disarm me  
You will go just like you've gone before  
One sad soldier off to war, enemies that only you can see.  
  
Dishes stacked, the table cleared  
It's always like the scene of the last supper here  
You speak so cryptically that's not news to me  
The flood is here it will carry you  
And I've got work to do.  
  
Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Come back here and shut the door  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.  
  
There is fire there is lust  
Some will trade it all for someone they could trust  
There's a bag of silver for a box of nails  
It's so simple the betrayal  
Though it's known to change the world and what's to come.  
  
Just come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Don't you recognize them anymore  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.  
  
There's the given and the expected  
I count my blessings while I eye what I've neglected  
Is this for better is this for worse  
You're all jammed up and the dam's about to burst.  
  
I hear the owl in the night  
I realize that some things never are made right  
By some will we string together here  
Days to months and months to years  
What if everything we have adds up to nothing.  
  
Come on home, the team you're hitched to has a mind of its own  
But it's just the forces of your past you've fought before  
Come back here and shut the door  
I'm stacking sandbags against the river of your troubles.

The volunteers come for your prayers  
And some souvenirs,  
With ivory skin and boycott lessons  
Year after year.  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I'm tracing your face up in the space of the bottom bunk,  
Oh Cordova.  
Where I cried and I cried,  
I knew I was trading on things that I didn't have,  
The things that I didn't have.  
  
Now you come to me  
With revolution's infidelity,  
With blacklisted friends and Tupperware kin,  
And your big history.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I memorize the lullabies  
Of dwindling lives.  
The lay of the land, the touch of each hand  
We lose by and by.  
  
[Chorus]

Take to the highway wont you lend me your name  
Your way and my way seem to be one in the same  
Momma don't understand it  
She wants to know where I been  
Id have to be some kind of natural born fool  
To want to pass that way again  
But you know I could feel it  
On a country road  
  
Sail on home to jesus wont you good girls and boys  
I'm all in pieces, you can have your own choice  
I could seen a heavenly band full of angels  
And they're a comin to set me free  
Don't know much about the wild wind  
But I can tell that it's bound to because I could feel it  
On a country road  
  
Guess my feet know where the want me to go  
Walking on a country road  
  
Walk on down, walk on down, walk on down  
Walk on down, walk on down a country road yeah  
La la la la la la la  
Country road  
Yeah walking on a country road  
Country road  
Yeah  
Walking on a country road

Crazy game  
I never should have started to play  
But now you couldn't tear me away  
Love is sweet sweet baby  
So good to you  
And so bad  
And I fear  
The situations clear before my eyes  
Confusion wants to break me and it tries  
I've been a little bit stronger from the start  
Listen to my heart  
  
Cause if you're ever believing  
I'm thinking of leaving  
Look to the moon  
Cause it's a fact  
She may go wandering about  
But she always comes shining back  
And it's true  
I'll wait for you  
  
You dry your tears  
Don't be thinking grey is here to stay  
Sometimes everything is in the way  
You're wanting to look at it  
Turn your view around  
Dry your eyes  
Eyes like yours should carry a smile  
I haven't seen them sparkle in a while  
Give it one more try  
Dry your eyes  
  
Cause if you're ever believing  
I'm thinking of leaving  
Look to the moon  
Cause it's a fact  
She may go wandering about  
But she always comes shining back  
And it's true  
I'll wait for you

Sitting in Darwins theory  
And you're down in the 48  
I'm practicing politics  
Your practicing guitar and staying out late  
How'd we get so turned around  
Why did we make it so hard  
Why can't we cut it out tender  
Give us something good to remember  
  
Hey my my my my rock star  
Saw your feet leave the ground  
You said all I wanted to be is loud  
I was ushering your friends in  
I was I was  
I was trying to clear the aisles  
How'd you get so turned around  
Why did you make it so hard  
Why can't you cut it out I'm tender  
Give me something good to remember  
  
I said  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
  
So it's Alaska in the summertime  
In the wintertime I'm free  
The days are short cold and wasted  
Nowhere is warm enough for me  
Baby you tell me what happened  
Why did I make it so hard  
Can't I cut it our you're tender  
Give you something good to remember  
  
Baby you tell me what happened  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
How did I make it so hard  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
I wonder  
Oh cut it out I'm tender  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
Give me something  
Give me something good to remember  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
(Why did you make it so hard)  
(can you tell me what happened)  
(Why did we make it so hard)  
(Can you tell me what happened)  
  
I said  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
Cut it out  
Cut it all out  
  
Hey my my my rock star  
Cut it out  
How did we get so turned around  
Cut is all out  
Hey my my my rock star

Cut it all out now

Out

Don't have much say  
But I call you up anyway  
Just to try and tell you the way  
That I feel today  
Oh I miss you baby  
  
Sure Im on the road  
I don't need to say much more  
Im just the same old well known stranger  
That I was before  
Seems like yesterday now  
  
Daddys all gone  
Hes just halfway home  
Hes holding on to the telephone  
Saying please don't let the show go on  
  
There's a bus every other hour  
Even a midnight train yeah  
But that don't leave me the power to see your face again  
Its not that simple anymore  
  
Your see there's a room full of smiling faces  
And there's a man standing by the door  
Oh and he says it's time we take our places  
And get down on the floor  
Oh I'd like to kill him baby  
Ah ah no now  
  
Daddys all gone  
Hes just halfway home  
Hes holding on to the microphone  
Singing please don't let the show go on

People smile and tell me Im a lucky one  
Weve just begun  
I think Im gonna have a son  
And he will be like he and me as free as a dove  
Conceived in love  
The sun is gonna shine above  
  
Even though we aint got money  
Well Im so in love with you honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise  
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be all right  
  
Love a boy who holds the world in a paper cup  
Drink it up  
Love him and hell bring you luck  
And if you find he helps your mind  
Sister take him home  
Dont you live alone  
Try to earn what lovers own  
  
Even though we aint got money  
Well Im so in love with you honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise  
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be all right  
  
And even though we aint got money  
Well Im so in love with you honey  
And everything will bring a chain of love  
And in the morning when I rise  
You bring a tear of joy to my eyes  
And tell me everything is gonna be all right

We were down at dead man's hill  
Smoking vines like cigarettes  
Looking through the trashy mags  
Trying to feel what's coming next  
You told me of crashing cars  
Older brothers and late night bars  
I told you what I feel most  
And you kept it like a ghost forever  
  
Don't you write it down  
Remember this in your head  
Don't take a picture  
Remember this in your heart  
Don't leave a message  
Talk to me face to face  
Talk to me face to face  
  
Lying on the bright blue jumping mat  
Dinner bell is ringing  
Barking dogs and model planes  
And the sound of passing trains  
We watch for bonfires in the sky  
On the beach in July  
Spin the bottle steal the kiss  
Postcards to the one I miss forever  
The one I miss forever  
  
Don't you write it down  
Remember this in your head  
Don't take a picture  
Remember this in your heart  
I'll leave a message  
When everything comes apart  
(Talk to me face to face)  
(Talk to me face to face)  
(Everything comes apart)  
I'll leave a message  
When everything comes apart  
  
I remember cats on fire  
Gasoline a burning spiral  
Standing underneath the night  
Fighting back with all my might  
Empty cans and charred remains  
Find them in the heat of day  
On the top of dead man's hill  
This is what I know of shame forever

We talked up all night  
And still came to no conclusion  
We started a fight  
That ended in silent confusion  
  
And as we sat stuck  
You could hear the trash truck  
Making its way through the neighborhood  
  
Picking up the thrown out  
Different from house to house  
We get to decide what we think is no good  
  
We're sculpted from youth  
The chipping away makes me weary  
And as for the truth  
It seems like we just pick a theory  
  
Ah it's the one that justifies  
Our daily lives  
And backs us with quiver and arrows  
  
To protect openings  
Cause when the warring begins  
How quickly the wide open narrows  
  
Into the smallness of  
Our deconstruction of love  
We thought it was changing  
But it never was  
It's just the same as it ever was  
  
A family of foxes  
Came to my yard and dug in  
So I looked in a book  
To see what this could possibly mean  
  
Yeah cause there's fate in the breeze  
Signs in the trees  
And possible tragic events  
  
When forces collide  
With the damage strewn wide  
And holes blasted straight through the fence  
  
Oh the sky starts to crash  
(into the smallness of)  
The rain on the roof starts to drumming  
(our)  
And laid up like cash  
(deconstruction of love)  
Your take on my list of shortcommings  
  
And now the show starts to close  
(the show)  
I know how this goes  
(starts to close)  
The plots a predicatable showing  
  
And though it seems grand  
We're just one speck of sand  
And back to the hourglass we're going  
  
Back to the smallness of  
(into the smallness of)  
Our deconstruction of love  
(our deconstruction of love)  
We thought it was changing  
But it never was  
  
We're still in the smallness of  
(into the smallness of)  
Our deconstruction of love  
(our deconstruction)  
We thought it was changing but it never was  
  
Our deconstruction of love  
  
Our deconstruction of love

Dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Though weve seen shaky times  
Theres still solid ground to be found  
I said dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Though I may seem strong  
Its only because  
Cause youre around  
  
You know me better than I do  
You know how things go to my head  
I said a few things to you  
Things that were better left unsaid  
But dont  
Dont give up on me baby  
Cause you know I love you  
And I always  
I always will  
  
Now love  
Loves a sweet kind of pain  
It can give you wings to fly  
Then it drags you on down  
But darling  
Ill never love this way again, no  
Youre the sweetest, sweetest, sweetest love  
Ive ever found  
  
You know me better than I do  
You know how things go to my head  
I said a few things to you  
Things that were better left unsaid  
But dont  
Dont give up on me baby, no  
Cause I love you  
And I always  
Always will

Well it ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe  
If you don't know by now  
It ain't no use to sit and wonder why babe  
It don't matter anyhow  
When the rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You're the reason I'm traveling on  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
Ain't no use in turning on your light babe  
It's a light I've never known  
There ain't no use in turning on your light baby  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
I wish there was something you could do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talking anyway  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
Ain't no use in calling out my name now  
Like you've never done before  
Ain't no use in calling out my name now  
I can't hear you anymore  
Thinking and wondering all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child, I'm told  
I gave her my heart, she wanted my soul  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
I'm going down that long lonesome road babe  
Where I'm bound I can't tell  
But goodbye is too good a word babe  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't saying you treated me unkind  
Coulda done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
And don't think twice, it's alright  
And don't think twice, it's alright  

Just yesterday morning they let me know you were gone  
Suzanne the plans they made put an end to you  
I walked out this morning and I wrote down this song  
But I just can't remember who to send it to  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
Won't you look down upon me jesus  
You gotta help me make a stand  
You just got to see me through another day  
My body's achin' and my time is at hand  
I won't make it any other way  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now  
But I always thought that I'd see you again  
I've been walkin' my mind to an easy time  
My back turned towards the sun  
Lord knows when the cold wind blows it'll turn your head around  
But there's hours of time on the telephone line  
To talk about things to come  
Sweet dreams and flying machines in pieces on the ground  
I've seen fire and I've seen rain  
I've seen sunny days that I thought would never end  
I've seen lonely times when I could not find a friend now now now  
But I always thought that I'd see you again

Fly away little bird  
Any place in this open mouthed world  
Begs to be fed like a bed that beckons you, but you won't rest  
Everyone's got a need to go  
Most of us stick with our row to hoe  
But not you, you're the black crow  
With a straight line, and no time  
For the birds of prey who wreck your nest  
Twice your size steal your best  
They set you on this course of your collision  
I am a stop along your way  
I am the words you'll never say  
I crossed the great beyond of fear  
I opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view  
You went there too  
Fly away little bird  
Find the song in you that no one's heard  
Strenghthen your wings as you sing your solo flight  
Through this short life  
Everyone's got a deep regret  
We try to ground ourselves to forget  
But your race to the end is neck and neck  
You love them, you love them not  
The birds of prey who wreck your nest,  
Twice your size steal your best  
They set you on this course of your collision  
I am a stop along your way  
I am the words you'll never say  
I crossed the great beyond of fear  
Opened my eyes and saw us there, what a view  
And you went there too  
But all along your chosen path are  
Window panes and sheets of glass  
That you won't see  
You fly too fast  
One day it will be over  
Fly away little bird  
The saddest song I ever heard  
Was the one that I wrote you in my heart  
That never made it to the world  

A hard knock  
A cold clock  
Ticking off my time  
A long look  
But no luck  
Couldn't seem to find  
Or unwind  
Into peace of mind  
Though I was trying  
  
A quick glance  
A big chance  
My heart beat like a drum  
I saw you  
And I knew  
Chances just don't come  
Round again  
Not like this  
First a laugh  
Then the kiss  
  
And I'm free in you  
I've got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
  
The lost time  
The self crime  
My big mistakes  
The clear voice  
Of bad choice  
Sounding like an ache  
In my day  
Not too bad  
But too real  
To go away  
  
But now I'm free in you  
I got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
  
And I don't know  
How you show  
Such gentle disregard  
For the ugly in me  
That I see  
That for so long  
I took so hard  
(i took so hard)  
But I truly believe  
(i truly believe)  
That you see the best in me  
(that you see the best in me)  
I'm enough  
For your love  
(enough for your love)  
And the thought  
Sets me free  
(and I'm free)  
Free in you  
Got no worries on my mind  
I know what to do  
That's to treat you right  
And love you kind  
Thank you ever on my mind  
Love is just like breathing  
When it's true  
And I'm free in you  
Yes I'm free  
In you

I'm harboring a fugitive  
Defector of a kind  
And she lives in my soul  
Drinks of my wine  
And I'd give my last breath  
To keep us alive  
  
Are they coming for us  
With cameras or guns  
We don't know which  
But we gotta run  
And you say this is not  
What I bargained for  
  
So hide yourself for me  
All for me  
  
We swore to ourselves  
We'd go to the end of the world  
But I got caught up in the whirl  
And the twirl of it all  
A day in the sun  
Dancing alone  
Baby I'm so sorry  
  
Now it's coming to you  
The lessons I've learned  
Won't do you any good  
You've got to get burned  
Well the curse and the blessing  
They're one in the same  
Baby it's all  
Such a treacherous gain  
  
Hide yourself for me  
I said hide yourself for me  
All for me  
  
I stood without clothes  
Danced in the sand  
I was aching with freedom  
And kissing the damned  
I said remember this  
As how it should be  
  
Oh baby I said  
It's all in our hands  
Got to learn to respect  
What we don't understand  
We are fortunate ones  
Fortunate ones  
I swear  
  
Hide yourself for me  
I will hide myself for you  
All for you  
(I will hide)  
All for you  
(Myself for you)  
I will hide myself for you  
All for you  
  
I stood without clothes  
I danced in the sand  
I was aching with freedom  
Kissing the damned  
I said remember this  
Is how it should be

The saddest sight my eyes can see  
Is that big ball of orange sinking slyly down the trees  
Sittin' in a broken circle while you rest upon my knee  
This perfect moment moment will soon be leaving me  
  
Suzanne calls from Boston the coffee's hot the corn is high  
And that same sun that warms your heart will suck the good earth dry  
With everything it's opposite enough to keep you crying  
Or keep this old world spinning with a twinkle in its eye  
  
Get out the map get out the map  
And lay your finger anywhere down  
We'll leave the figuring to those we pass on our way out of town  
Don't drink the water there seems to be something ailing everyone  
I'm gonna clear my head  
I'm gonna drink that sun  
I'm gonna love you good and strong while our love is good and young  
  
Joni left for South Africa a few years ago  
And Beth took a job all the way over on the West Coast  
And me I'm still trying to live half a life on the road  
Seems I'm heavier by the year and heavier by the load  
  
Why do we hurtle ourselves through ever inch of time and space  
I must say around some corner I can sense a resting place  
With every lesson learned a line upon your beautiful face  
We'll amuse ourselves one day with these memories we'll trace  
  
Get out the map get out the map  
And lay your finger anywhere down  
We'll leave the figuring to those we pass on our way out of town  
Don't drink the water there seems to be something ailing everyone  
I'm gonna clear my head  
I'm gonna drink that sun  
I'm gonna love you good and strong while our love is good and young

Love is but a song we sing  
And fear's the way we die  
You can make the mountains ring  
Or make the angels cry  
Though the bird is on the wing  
You may not know why  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Some may come and some may go  
We will surely pass  
When the one that left us here  
Returns for us at last  
We are but a moment's sunlight  
Fading in the grass yeah  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
If you hear the song we sing  
You will understand  
You hold the key to love and fear  
All in your trembling hand  
Just one key unlocks them both  
It's there at your command  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
  
Come on people now  
Smile on your brother  
Everybody get together  
Try to love one another right now  
Try to love one another right now  
Try to love one another right now

There's a letter on the desktop that I dug out of a drawer  
The last truce we ever came to  
In our adolescent war  
And I start to feel the fever  
From the warm air through the screen  
You come regular like seasons  
Shadowing my dreams  
  
And the Mississippi's mighty  
But it starts in Minnesota  
At a place that you could walk across  
With five steps down  
And I guess that's how you started  
Like a pinprick to my heart  
But at this point you rush right through me  
And I start to drown  
  
And there's not enough room  
In this world for my pain  
Signals cross and love gets lost  
And time passed makes it plain  
Of all my demon spirits  
I need you the most  
I'm in love with your ghost  
I'm in love with your ghost  
  
Dark and dangerous like a secret  
That gets whispered in a hush  
(don't tell a soul)  
When I wake the things I dreamt about you  
Last night make me blush  
(don't tell a soul)  
And you kiss me like a lover  
Then you sting me like a viper  
I go follow to the river  
Play your memory like a piper  
  
And I feel it like a sickness  
How this love is killing me  
I'd walk into the fingers  
Of your fire willingly  
And dance the edge of sanity  
I've never been this close  
I'm in love with your ghost  
  
Unknowing captor  
You never know how much you  
Pierce my spirit  
But I can't touch you  
Can you hear it  
A cry to be free  
Oh I'm forever under lock and key  
As you pass through me  
  
Now I see your face before me  
I would launch a thousand ships  
To bring your heart back to my island  
As the sand beneath me slips  
As I burn up in your presence  
And I know now how it feels  
To be weakened like Achilles  
With you always at my heels  
  
This bitter pill I swallow  
Is the silence that I keep  
It poisons me I can't swim free  
The river is too deep  
Though I'm baptized by your touch  
I am no worse than most  
In love with your ghost  
  
You are shadowing my dreams  
(In love with your ghost)  
(In love with your ghost)  
(In love with your ghost)

Through the dust bowl  
Through the debt  
Grandma was a suffragette  
Blacklisted for her publication  
Blacklisted for my generation  
Go go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside  
This time  
Don't assume anything  
Just go go go  
  
Feed the fire  
And fan the flame  
I know you kids can stand the rain  
I know the kids are still upsetters  
'cause rock is cool but the struggle is better  
Go go go  
  
And raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside  
This time  
Don't assume anything  
I said this time  
Now don't assume anything  
Just go  
  
The truth is I was afraid  
I felt inferior  
I felt I excelled in competing with others and I knew instantly that these
people were not competing at all, that they were acting in a strange, powerful
trance of movement together  
And I was filled with longing to act with them and with the fear that I could
not  
  
Did they tell you it was set it stone  
That you'd end up alone  
Use your years to psyche you out  
You're too old to care  
You're too young to count  
  
Did they tell you, you would come undone  
When you try to touch the sun  
Undermine the underground  
You're too old to care  
You're too young to count  
  
I said go go go  
  
I said this time  
Don't assume anything  
Just go go go  
Go go go  
Go go go

Sometimes I live in the country  
Sometimes I live in the town  
Sometimes I take a great notion  
To jump in the river and drown  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
Last saturday night I got married  
Me and my wife settled down  
Me and my wife parted  
Think I'll take another walk downtown  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
I love irene God knows I do  
Ill love her all my life  
If irene should ever leave me  
Ill take morphine and die  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
Stop your rambling stop your gambling  
Stop staying out late at night  
Come home to your wife and family  
Sit by the fireside bright  
  
Irene goodnight  
Irene goodnight  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams  
  
Goodnight irene  
Goodnight irene  
Ill see you in my dreams

Clearing webs from the hovel  
A blistered hand on the handle of a shovel  
I've been digging too deep, I always do.  
I see my fate on the surface  
I look a lot like Narcissus  
A dark abyss of an emptiness  
Standing on the edge of a drowning blue.  
  
I look behind my ears for the green  
Even my sweat smells clean  
Glare off the white hurts my eyes.  
Gotta get out of bed get a hammer and a nail  
Learn how to use my hands, not just my head  
I think myself into jail  
Now I know a refuge never grows  
From a chin in a hand in a thoughtful pose  
Gotta tend the earth if you want a rose.  
  
I had a lot of good intentions  
Sit around for fifty years and then collect a pension,  
Started seeing the road to hell and just where it starts  
But my life is more than a vision  
The sweetest part is acting after making a decision  
I started seeing the whole as a sum of its parts  
  
My life is part of the global life  
I'd found myself becoming more immobile  
When I'd think a little girl in the world can't do anything.  
A distant nation my community  
A street person my responsibility  
If I have a care in the world I have a gift to bring.

I've taken so many down  
I've helped them all to dismount  
I've followed so many down  
I take their hand me downs  
All with hope  
All with hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
All with hope  
All with hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all  
  
Everything that I believe  
Crawls from underneath the streets  
Everything I truly love  
Comes from somewhere far above  
Everything that I believe  
Is wrong with you is wrong with me  
Everything I truly love  
I love in you and I love in me  
So give me hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all  
  
You swear you can't swim the river  
(I've become the beggar now)  
(you've become the saint somehow)  
But I saw you running to jump in  
(I've become the beggar now)  
(you've become the saint somehow)  
I swore I'd never be your sinner  
(I've become the beggar now)  
(you've become the saint somehow)  
Til I held your sin  
Hand me downs  
  
Now you ask me why I'm here  
The same as you  
I'm scared, it's fear  
I've become the beggar now  
And you've become the saint somehow  
Twist the words and place the blame  
And tell me now aren't we the same  
Tripping in our yellow feet  
Checking underneath our sheets  
For some hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
Give me hope  
Give me hope  
That emptiness brings fullness  
And loss of love brings wholeness  
To us all

Thought you were one who wouldnt run  
Who wouldnt do me wrong  
But the song that you were singing  
Was the same old heartache song  
You treat me fine and you wined and dined  
And I believed you when you said  
I love you babe, but your only aim  
Was to get me in your bed  
Now I don't even like you no more  
But I can't get you off of my mind  
Baby youve got me livin in  
Heartache central time  
Heartache central  
Heartache central  
Heartache central time  
  
Anytime is a hurting time  
With a hurting heart like mine  
God knows Id get over you  
If only I could find  
A way to get my hurtin heart  
Off heartache central time  
  
Remember last september  
When you looked into my eyes  
I should have known that the love youd shown  
Was nothing more than lies  
I fell for you and I know its true  
That I should have stopped myself  
But my lonely heart was too alone  
To hurt all by itself  
Now I don't even like you no more  
But I can't get you off of my mind  
Baby youve got me livin in  
Heartache central time  
Heartache central  
Heartache central  
Heartache central time  
  
Anytime is a hurting time  
With a hurting heart like mine  
God knows Id get over you  
If only I could find  
A way to get this hurtin heart  
Off heartache central time

Shes been afraid to go out  
Shes afraid of a knock on her door  
Theres always a shade of a doubt  
She can never be sure  
Who comes to call  
Maybe the friend of a friend of a friend  
Anyone at all  
Anything but nothing again  
  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
  
Seems like even her old girlfriends  
Might be talking her down  
Shes got her name on the grapevine  
Running up and down the telephone line  
Talking bout someone said someone said  
Something bout something else  
Someone might have said about her  
She always figured that they were her friends  
Maybe they can live without her  
  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
It used to be her town  
It used to be her town too  
  
Well peopled gotten used to seeing them both together  
But now shes gone and life goes on  
Nothing last forever  
Oh no  
  
She gets the house and the garden  
He gets the boys in the band  
Some of them his friends  
Some of them her friends  
Some of them understand  
  
Lord knows that this is just a small town city  
Yes and everyone can see you fall  
Its got nothing to do with pity  
I just wanted to give you a call  
  
It used to be your town  
It used to be my town too  
But you never know til it all falls down  
That somebody loves you  
Somebody loves you  
Darling somebody still loves you  
I can still remember  
When it used to be her town too  
  
It used to be your town  
It used to be my town too  
Ah but you never know til it all falls down  
That somebody loves you  
Somebody loves you

Hey kind friend  
I don't know when I'll see you again  
On a ferry boat bound to Victoria  
Laying down to hide from the wind  
  
Big dipper hangin' over the city  
You know everything now is different for me  
And it ain't no use in  
Explainin' the scenery  
  
I said  
Kind friend  
Help me forget where I been  
Kind friend  
Remember who I am  
  
I was too late in Spokane  
So I caught a ride through the cascade range  
I saw the sun die in Olympia  
Running down on capital lake  
  
Now I ask you for some relief  
It's one true root that you bring to me  
It's 3 am  
And it's good company  
  
I said  
Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where I been  
Hey kind friend  
Help me remember who I am  
  
Hey kind friend  
Don't know if I'm gonna see you again  
It's okay friend  
It's okay friend  
  
(It's so hard when they all have)  
  
So I'll meet you in New Orleans or I'll see you around  
'Cause I don't know if it's worth coming down  
Hey I'm calling you  
From a gold rush town  
  
And I say  
Hey kind friend  
Help me forget where I've been  
Hey kind friend  
Help me remember who I am  
  
Hey kind friend  
I don't know if I'm gonna see you again  
It's ok friend  
I'm ok friend  
  
I said I'm ok friend  
I'm ok friend  
  
(See ya later)

I went all the way to Paris to forget your face  
Captured in stained glass, young lives long since passed  
Statues of lovers every place  
I went all across the continent to relieve this restless love  
I walked through the ruins, icons of glory  
Smashed by the bombs from above  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
Jeu de Paume's full of faces knowing peace, knowing strife  
Leisure and toil, still it's canvas and oil  
There's just no medium for life  
In the midst of the rubble I felt a sense of rebirth  
In a dusty cathedral the living God called  
And I prayed for my life here in earth  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.  
  
There are mountains in Switzerland, brilliant cold as they stand  
From my hotel room, watching the half-moon  
Bleeding its light like a lamb  
And the town is illuminated, its tiny figures are fast asleep  
And it dawns on me the time is upon me  
To return to the flock I must keep.  
  
So we must love while these moments are still called today  
Take part in the pain of this passion play  
Stretched our youth as we must, until we are ashes to dust  
Until time makes history of us.

Let's not drag this out  
Everything's in motion  
Though I've only ever loved you kind  
And with devotion  
I remember when I met you  
And even from the start  
I thought one day you'd probably just come home  
And break my heart  
  
It's funny what you know  
And still go on pretending  
With no good evidence  
You'll ever see that happy ending  
  
You  
Looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
Had to learn the hard way  
We were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill  
  
I know I'm a dreamer  
(i know that I'm a)  
So I'll give you that  
(dreamer)  
Still I hope I'm more than just a place  
(still I hope I'm more)  
You laid your hat  
(than a place you laid your hat)  
You're a land of secrets  
(you are its only)  
Its only citizen  
(citizen)  
And though I paid my dues  
(though I paid)  
I was never allowed in  
(i was never allowed in)  
And so I am a stranger  
(so I am a stranger)  
Especially today  
(especially today)  
As I get sad and lonely  
And you get your way  
  
You  
Were looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
I had to learn the hard way  
That we were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill  
  
Holding on for change I know  
We never stood a chance  
(no we never stood a chance)  
So I could only wait  
And watch you slip right through my hands  
(watch you slip right through my hands)  
  
You  
Were always looking for your distance  
And sensing my resistance  
You had to do your will  
  
I  
I had to learn the hard way  
We were just an empty dream too big  
For hope alone to fill

Christopher robin and I walked along  
As the branches lit up by the moon  
Posing our questions to owl and eyore  
As our days disappeared all too soon  
But I wandered much farther today than I should  
And I can't seem to find my way back to the woods  
  
So help me if you can I've got to get  
Back to the house at pooh corner by one  
Youd be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of christopher robin and pooh  
  
Winnie the pooh doesn't know what to do  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose  
Now he came to me asking help and advice  
And from here no one knows where he goes  
So I sent him to ask of the owl if hes there  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear  
  
So help me if you can I've got to get  
Back to the house at pooh corner by one  
Youd be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of christopher robin and pooh  
  
So help me if you can I've got to get  
Back to the house at pooh corner by one  
Youd be surprised theres so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of christopher robin  
Back to the ways of christopher robin  
Back to the ways of pooh

When we tried to rework all of this  
Each to her rendition  
Painted ourselves in a corner  
Lost for ideas blindly fishing  
For a compliment or kindness  
Just to bring us into view  
But you could not interpret me and I could not interpret you  
I remember that cold morning when the trees were black with birds  
I tried to make out some connection  
We were at a loss for words  
After all that we've been through  
I could not see giving up  
Despite the picture of our coffee growing colder in the cups  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
And I believe in you and I believe in love  
So we went rolling on down through the years  
Taking time off we could steal  
Until the thief of things unreconciled  
Stuck it's stick into the wheel  
Now we're tumbling in a freefall  
No one's gonna go unscathed  
But it's not because you held back and its not how I behaved  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
There are avenues and supplements and books stacked on the shelf  
Labyrinths of recovery in search of our best self  
But most of what will happen now is way out of our hands  
So just let it go and see where it lands  
I want to say that underneath it all you are my friend  
And the way that I fell for you I'll never fall that way again  
I still believe despite our differences that what we have's enough  
I believe in you and I believe in love  
I believe in you and I believe in love  

Emily:  
I walked into my favorite place one night  
Id just gotten back from a lecture  
And I was feeling kind of uptight  
And at the edge of the bar there was this guy  
And you know I wasnt really looking  
But I caught him out of the corner of my eye  
The next thing I know he was moving my way  
I thought he wanted to talk  
But this is what he had to say  
  
Amy:

But I want to be your lover

But I want to be your lover  
Your lover your lover your lover  
One time or another baby  
I want to be your lover  
  
Emily:  
I have to admit I was a little bit surprised  
But I wasnt really scared cause I was twice his size  
So I said to myself, okay, Ill play his game  
And when he turned to me  
I gave him my name  
  
Amy:  
I know your name babe  
But I got to know your number

Emily:  
Well I said to myself this guy is persistent  
Hes a little bit dumb but at least hes consistent  
I tried to talk cool but when we touched I went under  
I made a quick decision and I gave him my number  
  
Amy:  
I know your number  
But I don't know what to say babe  
  
Emily:

Emily:  
Well you probably wont believe this  
But we got married one day  
And I still don't know if he speaks english  
Cause he doesn't have much to say  
Its a damn good thing I like lying around  
We don't make much conversation  
But love makes sounds  
You know what I'm talking about  
Yall know what I'm talking about  
Well one thing I've learned from being in this state  
  
Emily and amy:  
There are other ways to communicate

But I want to be your lover  
Don't know your name babe  
But I want to be your lover  
Your lover your lover your lover  
One time or another baby

Well you followed me this far  
Did you find out what's inside  
Can you tell me what I'm doing  
Is it something I should hide  
I don't know for sure  
I don't wanna find out what I left there for  
  
I'm not scared and I'm not lonely  
Saving all my money or my breath  
I'm not looking for an answer  
Or anyone to second guess no  
  
You told me all your secrets  
And I filled you up with lies  
Now I'm living honestly  
Because I said goodbye  
I can't go home anymore  
I don't wanna find out what I left there for  
  
I'm not scared and I'm not lonely  
Saving all my money or my breath  
I'm not looking for an answer  
I'm not asking anyone to second guess  
  
I was losing all my senses  
I was losing all control  
It was getting so offensive  
Now you want me back for more  
And I just won't go  
  
If you think you know the answers  
You've got a lot of gall  
Cause it gives you satisfaction  
Knowing nothing at all  
I don't care anymore  
And I don't wanna find out what I left there for  
What I left there for  
  
I'm not scared and I'm not lonely  
Saving all my money or my breath  
I'm not looking for an answer  
I'm not asking anyone to take a second guess no

Take a second guess  
(Over one billion served)  
Take a second guess  
Oh yeah

They say everything can be replaced  
Well then distance is not near  
I remember every face  
Of everyone who put me here  
  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
They say everyone needs protection  
They say everyone must fall  
Yet I swear I see my reflection  
Some where so high above this wall  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
Standing next to me in this lonely crowd  
Is a man who swears hes not to blame  
All day long I hear him shout so loud  
That he swears he was framed  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
I see my light come shining  
From the west down to the east  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released  
  
Any day now  
Any day now  
I shall be released

It's alright forty days of rain  
My skin stretched out from the growing pain  
It'd be nice to have an explanation  
But it's alright  
  
And it's alright if you hate that way  
Hate me cause I'm different  
You hate me cause I'm gay  
Truth of the matter come around one day  
It's alright  
  
I look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand  
I look at the burned out empty like a plague across the land  
And for everything I learn there are two I don't understand  
That's while I'm still on a search  
Through the weather strewn church  
I'm doing the best that I can  
And it's alright  
  
And it's alright though we worry and fuss  
(alright)  
We can't get over the hump or get over us  
(we can't get over us)  
It seems easier to push than to let go and trust  
(alright)  
But it's alright  
  
When we get a little distant some things get clearer  
Yeah give em the space some hearts grow nearer  
I ran as hard as I could I still ended up here  
And it's alright  
  
As I look at this lifeline stretched way all across my hand  
(lifeline all across my hand)  
I look at the fires of hatred  
(fire)  
Burning up the bounty of this beautiful land  
(burning up the land)  
I know that I'm small in a way but I know I'm strong  
And it's my thirst that brought me to the water  
Well I give it all up then she carries me on  
It's alright  
  
Yeah  
  
And it's alright if I feel afraid  
My plans in pieces  
My plans mislaid  
It's the will of the way  
(the will of the way)  
The will of the way  
(it's the will of the way)  
The will of the only way that could have brought me here today  
And it's alright  
  
And it's alright

Go will i  
Over yonder  
I will see my mother  
And my sister  
And my father  
Oh but my brother is going to hell  
  
Well they hung him  
From the gallow  
As the sun turned  
Red from yellow  
And the crowd they  
Heard him haughty  
And they sighed  
With much relief  
  
The preacher asked him  
For any last words  
My brother spit on  
Onto his clean shirt  
Oh and he smiled  
Without redemption  
Said this is one soul  
God dont need  
  
Well now I loved him  
I will miss him  
As hes burning  
And twisting  
For his heart with  
Dedication  
To the devil  
And his creed  
  
Well as a child we  
Wed call him rotten  
Tell him he was lonely  
And forgotten  
And he revenged our  
Constant cheering  
Oh with his every  
Word and deed  
  
Oh yeah and for my  
Contribution  
To his souls lack  
Of retribution  
Oh well I ask the  
Lords forgiveness  
On my very bended knee

I left my anger in a river running highway 5  
New hampshire, vermont, bordered by  
College farms, hubcaps, and falling rocks  
Voices in the woods and the mountaintops  
  
I used to search for reservations and native lands  
Before I realized everywhere I stand  
There have tribal feet running wild as fire  
Some past life sister of my desire  
  
[Chorus]  
Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now  
Steady now and don't come out  
I'm not ready for the dead to show it's face  
Whose turn is it anyway?  
Anyway?  
  
Now when I was young my people taught me well  
Give back what you take or you'll go to hell  
It's not the devil's land, you know it's not that kind  
Every devil I meet becomes a friend of mine  
Every devil I meet is an angel in disguise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
White, chain, rope, fear  
(hush my darling)  
Be still my dear  
  
A bullet in the head, now he's dead  
A friend of a friend, someone said  
He was an activist with a very short life  
I think there's a lesson here - he died without a fight  
  
In the war over land where the world began  
Prophecies say it's where the world will end  
But there's a tremor growing in our backyard  
Fear in our heads, fear in our hearts  
Prophets in the graveyard  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Jonas and Ezekiel hear me now  
Steady now I feel your ghost about  
I'm not ready for the dead to show it's face  
Whose angel are you anyway?  
  
I said there's prophets in the graveyard  
(now I walk in beauty)  
Prophets in the graveyard  
(beauty is before me)  
Prophets in the graveyard  
(beauty is behind me)  
(above and below me)

Junkies lament  
  
Rikkis been kicking the gong  
Lickety split didn't take too long  
A junkies sick a monkeys strong  
That's whats wrong  
  
Well I guess hes been messing around down town  
So sad to see the man losing ground  
Hes winding down behind closed doors  
On all fours  
  
Mama don't you call him my name  
He can't hear you anymore  
And even if he seems the same to you  
That's a stranger to your door  
Go on ask him whats he come here for  
  
Oh my God a monkey can move a man  
Send him to hell and home again  
With an empty hand in the afternoon  
Shooting for the moon  
  
Hes halfway sick and its halfway stoned  
Hed sure like to quit but hes too far far gone  
And theyll wind him down with the methadone  
Hes all on his own  
  
Baby don't you throw your love away  
I hate to seem unkind  
Its only that I understand the man  
That the monkey can leave behind  
And I used to think he was a friend of mine

She was grasping for a way to tell us all  
The hurt she felt inside  
Were all too happy she says  
Lets have a war  
And the night digs deeper in  
  
Theyre just some words to pass the time  
Some words to pass the time  
  
Now when the silence gets to be too much  
I can feel the soul searching  
Where do I go when I've lost my cause  
We are the stories  
Even the good ones let me down  
There all just words to pass the time  
  
I used to be so sincere  
And maybe I still am  
And all this small talk I've been reeling off  
Is slowly getting out of hand  
  
I mix real feelings  
With the ones I wish I had  
And I catch the most important ones  
In between them all  
Sometimes it seems like theyre all just words  
To pass the time  
  
And then weve lost our time  
And weve wasted out words  
And all the strain is gone  
Sometimes its too unreal to believe  
Just don't give it all away  
Get a grip  
Causes sometimes there are just words to pass the time  
  
I said I'm too high I'm too high  
And I'm scared of falling down  
I've just been grasping for words  
To make you want to stay  
To make it worthwhile  
I don't want spend the rest of my life  
Just passing time  
I don't want to spend the rest of my life here  
Just passing time

These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
My cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through,  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
You take things so much easier than I do  
And you could live your life without me if you had to  
And you believe that in the end it all works out right  
And I might if not for you  
And if you ask one which one lives just alone for love  
I do.  
These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you  
My cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
There was a time when all signs pointed to the warm south  
The planets all lined up and built a new house  
And everything we talked about felt like a prophecy  
And when you looked at me they all came true  
And if you asked which one wants to go the distance  
I do.  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
My cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
I'm gonna rack my mind one last time until I cannot think  
I'm gonna dip into your memory and take a good stiff drink  
And when I'm drunk on the last drop of sadness about how we went wrong  
I'm gonna play this song  
Make some coffee black and strong  
Give thanks for healing time  
Finally make up my mind  
These are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you.  
Baby my cryin's through, I'm moving on.  
I don't regret and won't forget  
A single thing that we went through,  
But these are the last tears I'm gonna cry for you  
These are the last tears?I?m gonna cry for you.  

Oh the party?s kicked up a few notches  
Look at us getting loose  
She leans back against the wall and she watches, tugging her collar like it
might be a noose.  
And everyone's tied to their thing  
To their past or their drink or the date that they bring  
I just get tired all of sudden taking it in.  
And I want to lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of changes, strangers, illusion, confusion,  
I speak from my heart but I'm not really sure if it's true.  
I wanna lay my head down on you.  
Oh they say don't waste too much time planning  
Or you'll get rug ripped out  
And the only way you?ll be satisfied  
Is learning to live without.  
But some plan for the kingdom of heaven  
And some take their chances and bet lucky seven  
I don?t know what to believe, I just show up and breathe anymore.  
And I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of dressers, professors, lookers, hookers  
If I don?t get out I'll do something I don?t wanna do.  
And I wanna lay my head down on you.  
Was it so long ago  
That we sat and talked in your car  
Your things were all packed  
And the place you were headed not really that far  
Years later I think  
That I would have been much more alive  
To have taken you up on your offer and taken that drive  
Oh well everything that?s come before us leads us to where we are now  
And that's simple, I know so why can't I let go of the feeling  
That I'm lost somehow  
I'm just a ghost looking in  
Out of my own life just visiting  
In search of a body to have and to hold and to keep and to sleep.  
I wanna lay my head down on you  
Because you're the only solid thing in this room  
A room full of missed chance, slow dance, cold fate heartache  
I showed up for a party and saw my life story full view  
And I wanna lay my head down on you.  

I sit two stories above the street  
It's awful quiet here since love fell asleep  
There's life down below me though  
The kids are walking home from school  
  
Some long ago when we were taught  
That for whatever kind of puzzle you got  
You just stick the right formula in  
A solution for every fool  
  
I remember the time when I came so close to you  
Sent me skipping my class and running from school  
And I bought you that ring cause I never was cool  
What makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
  
So I just sit up in the house and resist  
And not be seen until I cease to exist  
A kind of conscientious objection  
A kind of dodging the draft  
  
The boy and girl are holding hands on the street  
And I don't want to but I think you just wait  
It's more than just eye to eye  
Learn the things I could never apply  
  
I remember the time when I came so close with you  
I let everything go it seemed the only truth  
And I bought you that ring, it seemed the thing to do  
  
What makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
So what makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
  
I'm just a mirror of a mirror myself  
All the things that I do  
And the next time I fall I'm gonna have to recall  
It's isn't love it's only something new  
  
I sit two stories above the street  
It's awful quiet here since love fell asleep  
There's life down below me though  
The kids are walking home from school  
  
I'm remember the time when I came so close with you  
Sent me skipping my class and running from school  
And I bought you that ring cause I never was cool  
  
What makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
So what makes me think I could start clean slated  
The hardest to learn was the least complicated  
The least complicated  
The least complicated

Jet fuel and traffic lines  
Pulling up to the delta signs  
Distant shape of my hometown  
Black stain where the wheels touch down  
  
I pick up the morning news  
I pass the man who's never shined my shoes  
Through security and to the train  
That will take me to the airplane  
  
Count the miles on the highway  
(count the miles on the highway)  
The sum of all my days  
(the sum of all my days)  
  
There's a postcard there's a call  
(there's a call)  
And there's a picture for your bedroom wall  
(bedroom wall)  
  
But do you ever wonder through and through  
Who's that person standing next to you  
(who's that person standing next to you)  
And after all the nights apart  
Is there a home for a traveling heart  
  
But if I weren't leaving you  
(if I weren't leaving, if I weren't leaving you)  
I don't know what I would do  
(I would do)  
  
But the more I go the less I know  
Will the fire still burn on my return  
Keep the path lit on the only road I know  
Honey all I know to do is go  
  
A cup of coffee and my bags are packed  
(coffee and my bags are packed)  
The same vow not to look back  
(same vow not to look back)  
(if I weren't leaving)  
  
Familiar emptiness inside  
(familiar emptiness inside)  
As the distances grow wide  
(if I weren't leaving)  
  
And though I vow to memorize  
(i vow to memorize)  
The last look in your loving eyes  
(the last look in your loving eyes)  
It's here dusk and there dawn  
Oh it's like a curtain getting slowly drawn  
  
But if I weren't leaving you  
(if I weren't leaving, if I weren't leaving you)  
I don't know what I would do  
(I would do)  
  
But the more I go the less I know  
Will the fire still burn on my return  
Keep the path lit on the only road I know  
Honey all I know to do is go  
  
But if I weren't leaving you  
(if I weren't leaving, if I weren't leaving you)  
I don't know what I would do  
(I would do)  
(Leaving you)  
  
But the more I go it seems the less I know  
(but the more I go the less I know)  
Will the fire still burn on my return  
(will the fire still burn on my return)  
Keep the path lit on the only road I know  
(keep the path lit on the only road I know)  
Honey all I know to do is go

Oh Eve, where is Adam?  
I see you've been kept  
Out of the garden  
And I said  
Oh, Eve, where is Adam?  
Now you've been kept  
Out of the garden  
I have wandered from shore to shore  
Don't you find that there's no more  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Don't you wish  
Love alone  
Don't you wish  
Love  
Don't you wish  
Love alone  
Don't you wish  
Love  
Don't you wish love alone  
Could save the world from disaster  
Is only love, inner confusion  
Is it just one more illusion  
And I said  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Well, if you want to have great love  
You've got to have great anger  
Well, if you want to have great love  
You've got to have great anger  
When I see innocent folks shot down  
Should I just shake my head and frown  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Girl if you want to hit the target square  
You've gotta look out (for it not happening there)?  
Or else it'll be just one more time  
The correction creates another crime  
Girl if you want to hit the target square  
You better not have right angles  
Oh, just keep one more time  
For the correction creates another crime  
  
Oh, Eve, you tell Adam  
Next time he asks you  
You say baby it's cold outside  
What's the password  
To come inside  
You say  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom haywah  
  
Oh Eve go tell Adam  
We've got to build a new garden  
Oh Eve go tell Adam  
We've got to build a new garden  
Got to get working on a building  
A decent home for all of god's children  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
Well if music  
Could only bring peace  
I'd only be a musician  
Well if music  
Could only bring peace  
I'd only be a musician  
Well if songs could do more than  
Dull this pain  
And all melodies bravely changed well  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Four thousand languages in this world  
Doesn't mean the same thing  
To every boy and girl  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah  
  
(save the world from disaster  
Well if only love....  
...well I sad...  
...just one more illusion...  
Oh Pacem in terres me shanti shalom aywah)

Another night in a succession  
Thinly glued with beer and wine  
Its a precarious profession  
Every day at work sees your heart on the line  
Maybe I should have gone to business school  
Or gained myself a respectable trade  
Or stayed in childhood where the shade keeps you cool  
Making my living selling lemonade  
But running through my veins  
Are the words and the refrains  
As if they were my lifeblood itself  
And you know I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5  
My dreams are just old picture on the shelf  
Oh yeah  
  
I remember the folks said give it a try  
Or you'll never know who you might have been  
And just remember nothing is the end of the world  
Until the world comes to an end  
Still there's a point to this philosophy  
(when you take a look inside)  
Of taking a look at who you are  
Still sometimes all I have to help me see  
Are all the mirrors behind the bar  
But running through my veins  
Are the words and the refrains  
As if they were my lifeblood itself  
And you know I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5  
My dreams are just old picture on the shelf  
Oh yeah  
  
But running through my veins  
Are the words and the refrains  
As if they were my lifeblood itself  
And you know I can't stay alive on the food of 9 to 5  
My dreams are just old picture on the shelf  
Oh yeah

Cold black coffee  
Incessant stream of cars  
Cigarette ash lies sprinkled like a fistful of grey stars  
Yesterday it rained silver rainbows on the ground  
Today the rains just water  
It wont stop from falling down  
  
I grow weary waiting for my muse  
But in between the times she comes  
I still have to tie my shoes  
And get on with my day  
There are mornings when Im more vigorous  
And there are days I have to take the bus  
  
Lifes so rich  
Lifes so empty  
  
Secret rendezvous  
Long distance from a phone booth  
Like two players in a mystery straight out of our youth  
Well Im finding that dramatics have lost their old appeal  
I play the part of stoic lover but Im not sure how I feel  
I get discouraged waiting for the world  
To understand this love affair  
To understand the girl  
There are moments when amelias right beside me  
The next thing I know  
I taste the salt of the sea  
  
Lifes so rich  
Lifes so empty  
  
Cold black coffee  
Incessant stream of cars  
Cigarette ash lies sprinkled like a fistful of grey stars  
Yesterday it rained silver rainbows on the ground  
Today the rains just water  
It wont stop from falling down  
  
I grow weary Im waiting for the world  
To understand this love affair  
To understand the girl  
There are moments when amelias right beside me  
The next thing I know, I taste the salt of the sea  
  
Lifes so rich  
Lifes so empty  
Lifes so strange  
Oh

Couple in the next rooms bound to win a prize  
Cause they've been going at it all night long  
And I'm trying to get some sleep  
But these motel walls are cheap  
And lincoln duncan is my name  
And heres my song  
And heres my song  
  
My father was a fisherman my mom a fishermans friend  
And I was born in the boredom and the chowder  
When I reached my prime  
I left my home in the maritimes  
And I, I headed down the turnpike  
For new england  
Sweet new england  
  
Had holes in my confidence  
And holes in the knees of my jeans  
And I was left without a penny in my pocket  
And ew-whee I was desitute as a girl could be  
And I wished I wore a ring so I could hock it  
Id surely hock it  
  
I met a young girl in the parking lot  
She was preaching to the crowd  
By singing sacred songs and reading from the bible  
Well I told her I was lost  
And she told me all about the penticost  
And I seen that girl as a road to my survival  
  
Later on the very same night  
She crept to my tent with a flashlight  
And these long years of innocence ended  
Took me to the woods  
I said her comes something that feels so good  
And just like a dog I was befriended  
I was befriended  
  
I said what a night  
What a garden of delight  
Even now that sweet memory lingers  
I was lying under the stars just playing my guitar  
But I was thanking the lord for my fingers  
For my fingers  
  
I know I know I know I know  
I know I know

Hey little darling  
Theres something that you should know  
This things gonna hound every soul  
This thing they wont let us go  
Gonna break us down to nothing  
Gonna eat us from the inside out  
Hey little darling  
I dont want you to feeling the fallout  
  
Ah when the cancer finally took him  
I was watching the trucks pull in  
Me and your daddy we had a job  
Under the ground mining uranium  
Some things your daddy leaves you  
Some things he dont  
Some things are gonna be here anyhow  
And some things just wont  
One thing I want you to understand  
Is you aint gotta be no mining man  
I curse the day that I went down  
And I pulled that shit out of the ground  
  
Now we were living over in nevada  
Thats where your people come from  
Your grandma would take me and your daddy  
On down to the gunnery range  
We sit and watch the bombs blow  
Until the sun goes down  
All those colors running like the painted desert  
And you get to see it now  
  
Them government boys have something so damn secret  
They had to hide it in the desert sand  
Out there the skies so big  
And there aint no mistaking it  
Whose got the winning hand  
  
Ah  
Ah ah ah ah  
  
I said Ive been all the way to alaska  
To a town they call point of hope  
Where they took some of what we got down here  
Just to see how it would grow  
I hear the lichen bought it  
And now its running through the caribou  
I said soon little darling  
Youll get to feel it too  
Get to feel it too  
Oh I said soon little darling  
Youll get to feel it to  
Hmm hmm hmm yeah  
Oh yeah hmm hmm  
Hmm hmm hmm  
Oh yeah hmm hmm  
Hmm hmm hmm

Long ago a young man sits  
And plays his waiting game  
But things are not the same it seems  
As in such tender dreams  
  
Slowly passing sailing ships  
On sunday afternoon  
Like the people on the moon I've seen  
Are things not meant to be  
  
Where do those golden rainbows end  
(where do the rainbows end)  
Why is this song so sad  
(why is this song so sad)  
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend  
(dreaming the dreams I dream)  
Loving the love I love  
  
To love is just a word I've heard  
When things are being said  
Stories my poor head has told me  
Can not stand the cold  
  
And in between what might have been  
And what has come to pass  
Are misbegotten guests alas  
And bits of broken glass  
  
Where do your golden rainbows end  
(where do the rainbows end)  
Why is the song I sing so sad  
(why is this song so sad)  
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend  
(dreaming the dreams I dream)  
Loving the love I love  
To love to love to love  
  
Where do your golden rainbows end  
(where do the rainbows end)  
Why is the song I sing so sad  
(why is this song so sad)  
Dreaming the dreams I dream my friend  
(dreaming the dreams I dream)  
Loving the love I love  
To love to love to love  
Whoa no no no no no

Anybody looking on they can see you're not so good  
People in the know they can see I miss you  
In the night with no one to hear me I'm afraid and I cry  
Seasons change but there's nothing changes my mind  
  
I've been loving you too long and I can't seem to stop  
You are my lifeline you make me happy  
I said that, had to say it baby  
Who on earth ever held me like you  
Id like to see someone try  
Love by you and no other loving will do  
  
In your time baby come back to me please  
Don't leave this girl lost in space  
Youre the only one who could guide me out of this maze

Living on free food tickets  
Theres water in the milk from the hole in the roof  
Where the rain came in  
But what can you do  
  
Well you got tears from your little sister  
Crying cause she doesn't have a dress without a patch  
For the party to go  
Oh but you know that shes gonna get by  
  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to  
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can  
As she can  
Oh yeah  
  
And its a good thing you don't have bus fare  
It would fall through the whole in your pocket  
And youd lose it in the snow on the ground  
You better walk to town and find a job  
  
Oh and you try to keep your hands warm  
The hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills you to the bone  
Youd better go home where its warm  
  
You can live in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man  
Daddys gonna buy you a dream to cling to  
Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can  
As she can  
Oh yeah  
  
Living on a dream aint easy no  
But the closer the knit the tighter the fit  
And the chills stay away  
We like to keep them in stride for family pride  
  
Faith is your foundation  
Got a whole lot of love and a long conversation  
But don't forget to pray oh no  
Its keeping us strong where we belong  
  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of the family man

Mamas gonna love you just as much as she can

Love the one youre with  
When youre down and confused  
And you don't remember who youre talking to  
Consentration gonna slip away  
Cause your baby is so far away  
  
Honey theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
If you can't be with the one you love  
Honey love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
  
Don't be angry and don't be sad  
don't sit crying over bad times youve had  
Cause theres a girl sitting next to you  
And shes just waiting for something to do  
  
Honey theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
If you can't be with the one you love  
Honey love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do

Turn your heartache right into joy  
Theres a girl honey youre a boy  
Well you get it together gonna make it nice  
You aint gonna need any more advice  
  
Honey theres a rose in the fisted glove  
And the eagle flies with the dove  
If you can't be with the one you love  
Honey love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Love the one youre with  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do do do  
Do do do  
Do do do

Guess I wasn't the best one to ask  
Me myself with my face pressed  
Up against love's glass  
To see the shiny toy I've been hoping for  
The one I never could afford  
The wide world spins and spits turmoil  
And the nations toil for peace  
But the paws of fear upon your chest  
Only love can soothe that beast  
And my words are paper tigers  
No match for the predators of pain inside her  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
Where there's now one there will be two  
  
I was born under the sign of cancer  
(Love will come to you)  
Like brushing cloth I smooth the wrinkles for an answer  
(Love will come)  
I'm always closing my eyes and wishing I'm fine  
(I close my eyes and wish you fine)  
Even though I know I'm not this time  
(Even though I know your not this time)  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
Where there's now one there will be two  
  
Dodging your memories a field of knives  
Always on the outside looking in on other's lives  
  
I say love will come to you  
Hoping just because I spoke the words that they're true  
As if I offered up a crystal ball to look through  
(I have offered up to you)  
Where there's now one there will be two  
  
And I wish her insight to battle love's blindness  
Strength from the milk of human kindness  
A safe place for all the pieces that scattered  
Learn to pretend there's more than love that matters

I'm in search of greener pastures  
Don't like my garden's what I said  
Although I'm working harder than last year  
I'm still deep in the red  
I am rowing as hard as I can  
And they're selling me up a stream  
I'm always one more step away  
From the american dream  
  
I got a chip on my shoulder  
About the size of a mental block  
I've got someone on the telephone  
Trying to sell me a future in stock  
Maybe I work too hard to be happy  
And I should practice letting go  
But it's hard not to rock the boat  
When you're sailing against the undertow  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to slide into the black  
And wear the black mask  
I might not get what I lack  
But it doesn't hurt to ask  
If I want to sail  
I need my life to be breezier  
I said please god or someone  
Make it easier  
  
I went to Sunday school every Sunday  
Swallowed the bait and I got the hook  
When I needed something someday  
I would read the good book  
Tell me what does it take to get ahead  
Sometimes I know I'd sell my soul  
When it looks like everybody else is flying  
And I'm crawling in the hole  
  
Well maybe if I open my own business  
Maybe if I buy a lottery ticket  
Someone tell me what is the secret  
To getting out of the thicket  
Give me more than just a sample  
I need a whole lot of glory  
My life become an example  
Of the american success story  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Make it easier  
Make it easier

Well theres something in us living  
Theres something you should know  
There was a time for us to fall  
Now its time to grow  
But you know its not the way  
That I intended it to be  
Crossing hearts and killing souls  
And trying to get down to whats real  
  
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home  
I let go of sinking sand wont you help me find a stone  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was to make this house a home  
  
All I needed was your hand to hold  
I spent so much time alone  
I needed your direction  
But we re-aligned my broken bones  
Well theyre running from a lifeless state  
Somehow we lost our hold  
All we have with us is change  
Left over from what started out as gold  
  
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home  
I let go of sinking sand - wont you help me find a stone  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was to make this house a home  
  
This is what I give to you  
Its flesh and blood  
Its body and soul  
Wont you take whats left of who I am  
And try to see it whole  
  
I'm holding you responsible for every word I say  
If you feel the brokenness  
Wont you try and look the other way  
I never meant to be so low  
I only wanted you to see  
That time was healing someone else  
But its tearing apart the very heart of me  
  
This is what I give to you  
Its flesh and blood  
Its body and soul  
Wont you take whats left of who I am  
And try to see it whole  
  
All I ever wanted was to make this house a home  
I let go of sinking sand - wont you help me find a stone  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
All I ever wanted  
Was to make this house a home  
So make this house a home  
Make this house a home  
Make this house a home

The boy he thinks I'm damaged goods  
I know he does and I guess he should  
I dress like him and I take him down  
He gets embarrassed when his friends come around  
  
I can get the girl  
But the boys just laugh  
I can get the girls  
But the boys just laugh  
  
So this is a measure of me  
Even though it shouldnt be  
The lion lays down with the lamb  
But I can't do it so I aint worth a damn  
  
I can get the girls  
But the boys just laugh  
I can get the girls  
But the boys just laugh at me  
  
Come on now graceful  
I want you to be  
Come on now social  
I said I want you to be  
Come on now special  
I I want you to be  
I want you to be  
  
I the virgin in the woods  
Tell me now if they are good  
  
Is it the boys who needed me  
I am you and you set it free  
  
I get the girls  
But the boys just laugh  
I get the girl  
But the boys he laughs at me  
  
I said this is the measure of me  
And even though it shouldnt be  
The lion lays down with the lamb  
Yeah but I can't do it and I aint worth a damn

Crossroads  
Seem to come and go  
The gypsy flies from coast to coast  
Knowing many, loving none  
Bearing sorrow, having fun  
But back home hell always run  
To sweet melissa  
  
Freight train  
Each car looks the same  
All the same  
No one knows the gypsys name  
No one hears his lonely sighs  
There are no blankets where he lies  
In all his deepest dreams the gypsy flies  
With sweet melissa  
  
Again the mornings come  
Again he's on the run  
Sunbeams shining through his hair  
Appearing not to have a care  
Pick up your gear and gypsy roll on  
Roll on  
  
Crossroads  
Will you ever let him go  
Will you hide the dead mans ghost  
Will he lie beneath the clay  
Will his spirit float away  
But I know that he wont stay  
Without melissa  
Yes I know that he wont stay  
Without melissa

Well I guess that I was lonely  
That's why I called you on the phone  
Cause in a moment of forgiveness  
I didn't want to be alone  
  
And I guess that I was willin  
More than I ever was before  
Cause in a moment of forgiveness  
I come a knockin at your door  
  
Baby I woke up crying last night  
Just to realize that you were gone  
Has it been two long years without you  
Tell me now  
When are you gonna come home  
  
Guess that I was hoping  
That you'd finally understand  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
You'd reach out and take my hand  
  
Now baby I know  
Your not one for bearing witness  
(baby I know)  
And you told me that  
One wrong move is gonna sell you out  
(one wrong move)  
And I see that you kept your word  
(see that you kept your word)  
And made it harder than it had to be  
Wish I could save you the trouble baby  
(oh oh oh)  
Give you a little piece of mind  
  
Baby I woke up crying last night  
Just to realize that you were gone  
It's been two long years without you  
When are you gonna come home  
  
Guess that I was hoping  
That you'd finally understand  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
You'd reach out and take my hand  
  
And in a moment of forgiveness  
You'd reach out and take my hand

So money made you mean  
And that's not how it's supposed to be.  
You're ready to challenge and defend,  
Yeah, but for all the wrong reasons.  
How much do we really need?  
A question, if you have to ask  
Just means what it means-  
The question that says everything.  
Right and left it's all the same conspiracy  
Just cause you ask, doesn't make a difference to me.  
You could keep it all or give it away  
But where did it come from in the first place?  
Robbing Peter to pay me, and I'll just be  
Giving it back to Peter to feel free.  
Now you have to fix everything that's broke  
Cause it'll never leave you alone.  
Reinvent the wheel, be the butt of a joke,  
Take the long road to charity.  
Right or left it's all the same conspiracy  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
Yeah it's just too hard, oh well, jump in.  
Forget about the sharks and swim,  
Cause now you're one, now you're one.  
You can't deny it anymore.  
Right or left it's all the same conspiracy  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
Robbing Peter to pay Paul  
Or robbing Peter to pay me.  
You can't deny it anymore.  

Each time you'd pull down the driveway  
I wasn't sure when I would see you again  
Yours was a twisted blind sided highway  
No matter which road you took then  
Oh you set up your place in my thoughts  
Moved in and made my thinking crowded  
Now we're out in the back with the barking dogs  
My heart the red sun  
Your heart the moon clouded  
I could go crazy on a night like tonight  
When summer's beginning to give up her fight  
And every thought's a possibility  
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen  
Why do you spend this time with me  
Maybe an equal mystery  
  
So what is love then is it dictated or chosen  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
Does it sing like the hymns of 1000 years  
Or is it just pop emotion  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
And if it ever was there and it left  
Does it mean it was never true  
And to exist it must elude  
Is that why I think these things of you  
I could go crazy on a night like tonight  
When summer's beginning to give up her fight  
And every thought's a possibility  
And the voices are heard but nothing is seen  
Why do you spend this time with me  
May be an equal mystery  
  
But you like the taste of danger  
It shines like sugar on your lips  
And you like to stand in the line of fire  
Just to show you can shoot straight from you hip  
There must be a 1000 things you would die for  
I can hardly think of two  
But not everything is better spoken aloud  
Not when I'm talking to you  
  
Oh the pirate gets the ship and the girl tonight  
Breaks a bottle to christen her  
Basking in the exploits of her thief  
She's a very good listener  
Maybe that's all that we need  
Is to meet in the middle of impossibility  
We're standing at opposite poles  
Equal partners in a mystery  
(Handed down and made by hand)  
  
We're standing at opposite poles  
Equal partners in a mystery

As I drive  
From your pearly gates  
I realize that I just can't stay  
All those mountains  
They kept you locked inside  
And hid the truth  
From my slighted eyes  
  
I came to you with a half-open heart  
Dreams upon my back  
Illusions of a brand new start  
Nashville  
Can't I carry the load  
Is it my fault that  
I can't reap what I sow  
Nashville  
Did you give me half a chance  
With your southern style  
And your hidden dance away  
You dance away  
And you dance away  
  
All these voices  
They whisper through my walls  
They talk of falling fast  
They say I'm losing it all  
They say I'm running blind  
To love of my own  
But I'll be walking proud  
I'm saving what I still own  
  
I fell on my knees to kiss your land  
But you are so far down  
And I can't even see to stand  
In nashville  
You forgot the human race  
You see with half a mind  
What colors hide the face  
Nashville  
I'd like to know your fate  
I'd like to stay a while  
But I've seen your lowered states today  
I've seen 'em today  
Honey I swear I've seen 'em today  
  
Now I'm leaving  
I've got all these debts to pay  
You know we all have our dues  
I'll pay 'em some other place  
Ah I never ask that you pay me back  
We all arrive with more  
I left with less than I had  
  
Your town is made for people passing through  
A last chance for a cause  
I thought I knew  
But nashville  
You tell me what you are gonna do  
With all your southern style  
It'll never pull you through  
Nashville  
I can't place no blame  
But if you forget my face  
I'll never call your name again  
No never again  
No never again  
  
I fell on my knees to kiss your land  
But you are so far down  
And I can't even see to stand  
In nashville  
You forgot the human race  
You see with half a mind  
What colors hide the face  
Nashville  
I'd like to know your fate  
I'd like to stay a while  
But I've seen your lowered states today  
I've seen 'em today  
Honey I swear I've seen 'em today  
I'm running away I'm running away  
I'm running I'm running  
I'm running away

As I was wading through your distance  
I heard you say theres no way out  
And I was just thinking as my independence faded  
Well theres no way in for me  
  
Theres no way out and you know  
Theres no way in  
Were on either side  
Scared to say were friends  
  
Now I found jesus and you found yourself  
Sometimes I still feel like I'm losing out  
But we both found that its just too hard to know for sure  
Just what we can lean on when were falling down  
  
You always did see  
The other side of things and sometimes  
I'm bound to wonder  
Do you see through me  
  
With all the voids I tried to fill  
And all the emptiness I tried to tell you about  
There was never time enough  
There are never words enough  
And Ill never have the guts enough  
But Ill tell you I've been needing you so bad  
  
Theres no way out and you know  
Theres no way in for me now  
And were on either side  
And were crying for a friend  
  
Theres no way out and you said  
Theres no way in for me now  
And were on either side  
And were scared to say were friends

When I walked you to the door I was feeling mighty fine  
I was thinking hey I've got love to ease my mind  
Then I got to the car and I was staring at your scars  
Thinking hey, this aint no way to spend my time  
  
Now I want a true love affair  
Not this touch-and-go in the air  
You know I don't know if I'm coming or I'm down  
I don't want a love touch and go  
I want a feeling I only know  
Or else you can get me out of this town  
  
When I saw you smile I knew one look into your eyes  
And I was thinking hey, are you in love again  
Then I heard you laugh honey you were laughing at the past  
I was thinking this aint no way to treat a friend  
  
You were laughing at the past  
Honey you were smiling through your glass  
Watching cars drive away in your mind  
You were hoping I would leave  
Honey I was dreaming I could stay  
And this aint no way to spend my time  
This aint no way to treat a friend  
This aint no way to see me  
I'm looking for the end  
This aint no way to treat a friend  
  
Now I want words I want touch  
Maybe that's a bit too much  
For one so far removed  
From what you used to claim  
Well if you be cruel, Ill still be kind  
You know I've got it in my mind  
I'm in love with you  
I aint gonna play your games  
If you want my advice  
don't say its wrong if it feels right  
don't push me down just to see me crawl  
Ill be crawling on the floor  
Then Ill be reaching for the door  
Ill be crawling right out of your eyes  
Honey Ill be walking right out of your eyes  
Honey Ill be walking right out of your eyes

Now we can say that nothing's lost and only change brings round the prophecy  
Where now it's melting, the solid frost was once a veil on greener landscapes
we would see  
Beneath my surface the water's heating  
And steam comes up and out the tears you see me shine  
For every strange and bitter moment there was never a better time  
  
For every pleasure exacts its pain  
How you hurt me how you were good to me  
Beneath my window a mournful train that makes me smile at my bad poetry  
Beneath my surface a song is rising  
It may be simple while it hides its true intent  
We may be looking for our deliverance but it has already been sent  
  
It's in the night fall when the light falls  
And what you've seen isn't there anymore  
It's in our blind trust that love will find us  
Just like it has before  
  
They're sending soldiers to distant places  
X's and O's on someone's drawing board  
Like green and plastic but with human faces  
And they want to tell you it's a merciful sword  
  
But with all the blood newly dried in the desert  
Can we not fertilize the land with something else  
There is no nation by god exempted  
Lay down your weapons and love your neighbor as yourself  
  
In the night fall when the light falls  
And what you've seen isn't there anymore  
It's through our blind trust that love will find us  
Just like it has before

"he did, he observed Saturday as the sabbath"  
"what, what kind of faith does that make him?"  
"Uh, he didn't have one"  
"oh, O-K"  
"He didn't believe in any one thing,  
he would go out on the street and all the kids would play the  
with a drum like thing, some kind of an instrument, yeah,  
and mama played the organ.  
she had a organ and she played that and she got a real big kick out of it."  
  
Oh Ozilline  
The moon is almost full  
And you don't need a torchlight  
To see into these woods  
Now sister bring the medicine  
To keep you from decline  
But it's the waxing and the waining  
That's always on your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
I said, oh Ozilline  
(Oh Ozilline)  
I feel for you  
I said, oh Ozilline  
(Oh Ozilline)  
I feel for you  
  
As soon as the corn's in  
The deer will come to feed  
And when the berry ripens  
The bird will come to eat  
You build by the river  
It's pretty but you'll pay  
'Cause the springtime brings the flood plain  
And your cutbank washes away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I had to put the dog down  
Before I hit the road  
Yeah I watched that sweet old life  
Become a bag of bones  
So when you're body's broken  
And your heart wants to give in  
And you hear that hoot owl callin'  
Just like she was a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said Ozilline she don't let you cry  
If you ask her where it hurts  
I said Ozilline she don't let you cry  
If you ask her where it hurts  
She said what a blessed sky

Well we read best selling novels  
So we can talk between the lines  
And we often close our eyes  
Just to hide the dollar signs  
And were suddenly pretentious  
And conform with the stream  
Were born and bred believers  
In the american dream  
  
And we drink our whiskey straight  
Though we do not like the taste  
And we dress in obligations  
With a top hat show of haste  
And we hinder our reactions  
As we measure what we say  
Until someone starts to cry  
And the faces turn away again  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
If you play us a happy song  
And help us forget  
Play it again sam  
  
Well we donate to our charities  
To deduct our future taxes  
And we flock to bars for drinking  
Though one never quite relaxes  
And we compromise our standards  
If it means well get attention  
And the things we need the most to say  
Are the things we never mention  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
If you play us a happy song  
And help us all forget  
Play it again sam  
  
Now I know God is up in heaven  
Its hard to keep in mind  
Sometimes when youre searching for relief  
And hell is all you find  
And I know that I'm a romantic  
I might seem a fool to say  
I'm know I'm going to see a few hands joined  
Before my dying day  
  
Play it again sam  
Take it slow and easy  
Sing about the land of the brave  
And the home of the free  
And theres a man who will tip you  
Better than youve gotten yet  
Just play us a happy song  
And help us all forget  
Play it again sam  
Play it again sam  
Play it again sam

Well evening fell just like a star  
Left a trail across the sky  
You spit as you walked out the door  
If this is love were crazy  
As we fight like cats and dogs  
I just know theres got to be more  
So please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
Its too cold to be out walking the streets  
We do crazy things when were wounded  
Everyones a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Walking in the rain  
  
Ill admit I aint no angel  
Ill admit I aint no saint  
I'm selfish and cold but youre blind  
If I exercise my devils  
Well my angels may leave too  
And theyre so hard to find  
So please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
Its too cold to be out walking the streets  
We do crazy things when were wounded  
Everyones a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Walking in the rain  
  
Were always at each others throats  
You know it drives me up the wall  
Most of the time blowin off steam  
I wish to hell youd leave me  
Wish to God youd stay  
Lifes so different than in our dream  
Please call me, baby  
Wherever you are  
Its too cold to be out walking the streets  
We do crazy things when were wounded  
Everyones a bit insane  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Walking in the rain  
I don't want you catching your death of cold  
Out walking in the rain

I am a problem child  
I've been wild all my days  
All my anger and my rage  
My senses said it would lead me astray  
I said go go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside this time  
Don't assume anything  
But go go go  
  
Five generations running fast  
These things will not pass  
This debtors blood runs in my veins  
I can't change anything  
I said no no no  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside this time  
Don't assume anything  
But go go go  
  
So youve learned to cry  
But you don't know why  
So youve learned to laugh  
What are we laughing at  
  
So I am a problem child  
I've been wild all my days  
All my anger and my rage  
My senses said it would lead me astray  
And I said go go go  
Go go  
  
Raise your hands  
Raise your hands high  
Don't take a seat  
Don't stand aside this time  
Don't assume anything this time  
Don't assume anything  
I said go go go

Old pirates yes they rob I  
Sold I to the merchant ships  
Minutes after they took I  
From the bottomless pit  
But my hand was made strong  
By the hand of the almighty  
We forward in this generation  
Triumphantly  
Wont you help to sing  
These songs of freedom  
Cause all I ever had  
Redemption songs  
  
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery  
None but ourselves can free our minds  
Have no fear for atomic energy  
Cause none of them are gonna stop the time  
How long must they kill our prophets  
While we stand aside and look  
Some say it's just a part of it  
Weve got to fulfill the book  
  
Wont you help to sing  
These songs of freedom  
Cause all I ever had  
Redemption songs  
Redemption songs  
Redemption songs

Dog at the window still looks all day never gets her fill  
Cause a glance means a chance to break the birds out congregating  
I have seen a look like that you licked your chops from where you sat  
Make your kill for a thrill and you don't mind waiting  
Rise up your dead, there's life in the old girl yet  
Rise up your dead  
  
When it bums you out, all the hunters sprung to pounce  
And at best it's a mess like a nest infested  
You remember there's more than this  
There always was and always is  
  
Tend the artist in your charges, you are full invested  
And if you need to, read your mindless mag  
Call me up for tickets, we'll go see Sugarland  
And it gets better even when it's been a drag  
Just move to the music, move your body to the band and  
Rise up

It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
Putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
  
But it don't snow here  
It stays pretty green  
Gonna make a lot of money  
Then I'm gonna quit this crazy scene  
And I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
  
I wish I had a river so wide  
I would teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
'cause I made my baby cry  
  
You tried hard to help me  
And you put me at ease  
Then loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in my knees  
And wish I had a river  
That I could skate away on  
  
I'm so hard to handle  
I'm selfish and i'm sad  
Now I lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
And I wish I had a river  
That I could skate away on  
  
I wish I had a river so wide  
I could teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
That I could skate away on  
Cause I made my baby say goodbye  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
Putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
But I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
  
God I wish I had a river so wide  
I'd teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I made my baby say goodbye

It didn't happen for you,  
No one wants to hear the truth,  
Coming from three political queers.  
Plucking the punk rock bloom.  
So you break up the band  
And leave us all in tow.  
Now we gotta figure out  
Where to go.  
I caught it at a rave  
Did it give you vaccination?  
I saw it on my T.V.  
Did it lighten up your load?  
And every fuckin D.J.  
Did you feel affilliated,  
Is telling me I'm free.  
Like you really had a home?  
Free to be a loser  
Were the ticket prices too high?  
Free to be a trend  
Were the lights too bright?  
Free to be a backlash over and over again.  
Was it all a bunch of hype?  
You say, "I'm losing inspiration,  
One band at a time.  
I gotta know there's someone, somewhere, out there singing for our side."  
Where I come up, we share the mortar and the glue.  
And what we build together, we share that too.  
And the wind may come, and the rain may fall,  
But we stand together or we don't stand at all.  
Where are you going to now,  
Now that the goings gone?  
So here's to your survival  
And swimming up the stream,  
Crossing over one dam after another  
Until we get to Rock and Roll Heaven's gate.  
I caught it at a rave  
Did it give you vaccination?  
I saw it on the T.V.  
Did it lighten up your load?  
And every fucking D.J.  
Did you feel affiliated,  
Is telling me I'm free.  
Like you really had a home?  
Free to be a loser  
Were the ticket prices too high?  
Free to be a trend  
Were the lights too bright?  
Free to be a backlash over and over  
Until I get to Rock and Roll Heaven's gate.  

Oh people  
Look around you  
The signs are everywhere  
Youve left it for somebody other than you  
To be the one to care  
Youre lost inside your houses  
And theres no time to find you now  
Well your walls are turning  
Your towers are burning  
Gonna leave you here  
And try to get down to the sea somehow  
  
The road is filled with homeless souls  
Every woman child and man  
Who have no idea where they will go  
But theyll help you if they can  
But everyone must have some thought  
That's gonna pull them through somehow  
While the fires are raging hotter and hotter  
The sisters of the sun are gonna  
Rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
Ill get down the sea somehow  
  
Oh people  
Look among you  
Its there your hope must lie  
Theres a seabird above you  
Gliding in one place  
Like jesus in the sky  
We all must do the best we can  
And then hang on the that gospel plow  
When my life is over  
Gonna stand before the father  
And the sisters of the sun are gonna  
Rock me on the water now  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
Maybe Ill remember  
Maybe Ill remember how  
  
Rock me on the water  
I said the wind is with me now  
So rock me on the water  
Ill get down the sea somehow  
  
Rock me on the water  
Sister will you soothe my fevered brow  
Rock me on the water  
Ill get down the sea somehow

Theres colors on the street  
Red white and blue  
People shuffling their feet  
People sleeping in their shoes  
Theres a warning sign on the road ahead  
Theres a lot of people saying wed be better off dead  
Don't feel like saton but I am to them  
So I try to forget it any way I can  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
  
I see a woman in the night  
With a baby in her hands  
Under an old street light  
Next to a garbage can  
And she puts the kid away  
Cause she wants to get a hit  
She hates her life  
And what shes done to it  
One more kid that will never go to school  
Never get to fall in love never get to be cool  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
  
We got a thousand points of light  
For the homeless man  
A kinder gentler machine gun hand  
We got department stores and toliet paper  
Styrofoam boxes for the ozone layer  
The man in power says to keep our hope alive  
Fuel to burn roads to drive  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world  
Keep on rockin in the free world

You don?t want me calling you up  
All melancholy sick from love  
You prefer it uncomplicated  
Things are tricky now I bet you hate it  
Your mind?s eye finds the exit sign  
And you?re off in perfect fashion  
And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
The party?s over, we had our fun  
Flirting with madness a loaded gun  
As much as nothing everything?s changed  
I?m soaking in it, it falls like rain  
You seek the sun to dry off what?s been done  
You?ll heat up every corner of the world  
As you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  
Can you keep this pace forever  
I have never seen it done  
Up deep burn all you leave behind you  
You are the surface of my sun  
I measure to what degree  
I can shape up what?s been forged in me  
The cooper penny hissing in the pool  
So much for wishes so much for cooling  
Down this fire impossible desire  
The further you get the more I?m drawn  
And you run, that?s all you?ve ever done  
It?s all you know to do  
I can?t hold that against you  
And you?ll flee cause you?re born to be free  
And if you go I?ll understand  
But you better get out while you can  

Mister pull up a chair  
I got time for tears  
Tell me all the stories that you never did  
Of the salty south  
The Seminoles held out  
While Geronimo died in a lonely jail  
  
A thousand tides, and  
A thousand waves  
Takin' it all away  
  
It'll come back in  
We'll be gone by then  
And it's a miracle we ever learned to live  
  
Drain that land  
For a better plan  
Sugarcane and the civil man  
But now the ringin' dead them pines  
Planted in that time  
We gonna keep on killin' till they get it right  
  
A thousand tides, and  
A thousand waves  
Takin' it all away  
  
It'll come back in  
We'll be gone by then, oh  
And it's a miracle we ever learned to live  
  
I remember the wind  
As it was settlin'  
And every sun goin' down was a picture then  
But we look back at 'em framed  
They all look the same  
There's no sense of time, no sense of pain  
  
A thousand tides, and  
A thousand waves  
Takin' it all away  
  
And it'll come back in  
We'll be gone by then, oh  
And it's a miracle we ever learned to give

Scooter boys and Argentinians  
Europe shed the blood of the Indians  
Here I sit in the land of plenty  
Crying about my own virginity  
  
Hey blue blood you're nothing new  
See I come from privilege too  
A chapter in the book on the Americas  
And your just another colonial terrorist  
  
Scooter boys and Argentinians  
Europe shed the blood of the Indians  
Here I sit in the land of plenty  
Crying about my own virginity  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Way down south where the Maya reign  
Zapata reading poetry in his grave  
They say we're stealing from the best  
To feed the poor  
Well they need more  
  
Scooter boys and Argentinians  
Europe shed the blood of the Indians  
Here I sit in the land of plenty  
Crying about my own virginity  
  
Yeah

Oh  
  
Yeah  
Yeah

Sister I'm heading out of alabama  
So you better think fast  
The wind is gonna pick me up now  
And the rain won't slack  
I'm heading down to georgia  
So don't lose track  
Of where you've been and where you're going now  
Who you've seen and what they lack  
And why you come undone  
Every time you go there  
You come undone  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
I know your heart's in danger  
And so is your life  
I said you learn to trust a stranger  
And stop and rest for the night  
Set your sight up in the headlight  
Well the moon won't be enough  
(sister)  
And light the embers of another  
And the night won't won't seem so rough  
Sister  
  
Ah  
There was a bloody beast of burden  
(i wish I was a mother)  
On a dark texas road  
(with a baby at my breast)  
A woman in a family way  
(i am just a farmer)  
And a car that lost control  
(with a milkcow and a mess)  
I'm studying the distance  
(i wish I was a mother)  
Between the blanket and the gun  
(with a baby at my breast)  
I got ten hours to natchez  
(i am just a farmer)  
And another ten home  
(with a milkcow and a mess)  
Well I'm goin' home  
Yes  
  
I know your heart's in danger  
(sister)  
And so is your life  
(sister)  
I say learn to trust a stranger  
(learn to trust)  
And stop and rest for the night  
Set your sight up in the headlight  
Yeah the moon won't be enough  
And light the embers of another  
And the night won't seem so rough  
Sister  
Go ahead  
I said come on  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
Ah oh yeah  
  
I said it's trust that brought me here  
And trust will bring me home

If you ever feel you'll lose your dreams  
Or your hope seems too far gone  
Ill bring the distance to your door  
You couldn't ask for any more  
  
You were around when I needed a friend  
You were the means you were the end  
Youll be the one I'll turn to now  
There's gonna be some hard times coming down  
  
Without you the world would be so crowded  
Without you the moon would be so clouded  
Without you I can be anyone  
Anyone at all but myself  
  
If ever your candle wont blow out  
Or your sorrow seems so interrupted  
Well I'll be the first to bring the darkness down  
Ill be the silence at your side  
  
Without you the music couldn't move me  
The words would ring true  
But the tune would feel so empty  
Without you I can be anyone  
Anyone at all but myself  
But myself  
  
Wish I was a slow moving sea  
Moving away from the land so cautiously  
Id find me an island to surround  
Just like you did as I was feeling down  
As I was feeling down  
  
Without you the world would be so crowded  
Without you the moon would be so clouded  
Without you I can be anyone  
Anyone at all but myself  
Oh but myself  
  
Wish I was a slow moving sea  
Wish I was a slow moving sea  
Love is like a slow moving sea  
Keeping in touch with eternity  
Wish I was a slow, slow, slow, slow moving sea  
Love is like a slow moving sea

Southern man better keep your head  
Don't forget what your good book said  
Southern change gonna come as last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man  
  
I saw cotton  
I saw black  
Tall white fences  
Little shacks  
And southern man  
When will you pay them back  
I heard screaming  
Bull whips cracking  
How long how long  
How  
  
Southern man better keep your head  
Don't forget what your good book said  
Southern change gonna come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man  
Southern man  
  
Lilly belle your hair is golden brown  
I've seen your black man coming round  
I swear by God I'm gonna cut him down  
I heard screaming  
Bull whips cracking  
How long how long  
How  
  
Southern man better keep your head  
Don't forget what your good book said  
Southern change gonna come at last  
Now your crosses are burning fast  
Southern man

Maybe we'll make Texas by the morning  
Light the bayou with our taillights in the night  
Eight hundread miles to El Paso from the state line  
And we never have the money for the flight  
  
I'm in the back seat sleepy from the travel  
Played our hearts out all night long in New Orleans  
I'm dirty from the diesel fumes, drinking coffee black  
When the first breath of Texas comes in clean  
  
And there's something bout the Southland in the springtime  
Where the waters flow with confidence and reason  
Though I miss her when I'm gone it won't ever be too long  
'Til I'm home again to spend my favorite season  
  
When God made me born a Yankee He was teasin'  
There's no place like home and none more pleasin'  
Than the Southland in the springtime  
  
In Georgia nights are softer than a whisper  
Beneath a quilt somebody's mother made by hand  
With the farmland like a tapestry passed down through generations  
And the peach trees stitched across the land  
  
There'll be cider up near Helen off the roadside  
And boiled peanuts in a bag to warm your fingers  
And the smoke from the chimney meets its maker in the sky  
With a song that winter wrote whose melody lingers.

There's love in the corners  
and love down the straight highway  
there's danger in the outskirts of town  
and in what you don't say  
you're either sinking or thinking  
the dark's your romance  
or a special one's shining a light on a chance  
that it's all very worthy to ache  
in the middle of the night  
  
Sometimes I can't sleep  
I can't keep all these feelings at bay  
I am rage, I am sorrow and grief  
all alone in my way  
I know humor and heartbreak  
and people are life  
if I keep my eyes closed  
i'll be open to strife  
because the powers that be send their love  
in the middle of the night  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.  
  
To my mother my father  
my witnesses live in my jagged heart  
that for years has been running like fire  
as though that was its part  
from lover to cover and ocean to sky  
from desert to mountain and promise to lie  
I can say that I've prayed to forgiveness  
in the middle of the night  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.  
  
Now I can see love in the woman  
And love in the man in myself  
I see how most people just ache to be good  
at expressing themselves  
and I wish I could tell you just right what I mean  
about the light shining down, if I'd only come clean  
but for now I live with myself  
in the middle of the night.  
  
I'm gonna stand up  
and let myself be counted for  
stand up now  
I've got my one life  
and what's it to amount to  
if I don't learn how  
to love you and love myself beside you  
mix the gentle and proud  
I want to love life.  
The vision in the window told me --  
stand up.

If you were here in Starkville  
Townie boys would love the way you stare  
If you were here in Starkville  
Well the local girls they wouldn't have a prayer  
  
Well I've spent a reckless night inside the wonder  
Of your everlasting charm  
Now I'm haunted by geography and the flora  
And the fauna of your heart  
  
At the dawning of some road worn day  
I call you on a whim just to say  
The morning birds are singing  
But I could not do them justice  
So I hung up and I fell back to sleep  
  
But I'm in love with my mobility  
Sometimes this life can be a drag  
Like when I noticed your nobility  
And how my leaving  
It only held you back  
  
But I remember one occasion  
When you were drinking  
And you asked me to the coast  
But I was hell bent on agony back then  
And so I missed the boat  
  
At the dawning of some road worn day  
I call you on a whim just to say  
My regrets become distractions  
When I can not do them justice  
Then I hung up and I fell back to sleep  
  
When I was down in Starkville  
I was hiding out inside some comfort inn  
From a local gang of troubadours  
When the homecoming queen  
She come ridin in  
(oooh)  
Yeah  
  
Yeah but I slipped out of my room into the rain  
(oooh)  
And I went running for my health  
(oooh)  
I watched those headlights turn to moonlight  
And finally I was running by myself  
  
Now its the dawning of some road worn day  
And I call you on a whim just to say  
The morning birds are singing

I come to you with strange fire  
I make an offering of love  
The incense of my soil is burned  
By the fire in my blood  
I come with a softer answer  
To the questions that lie in your path  
I want to harbor you from the anger  
Find a refuge from the wrath  
  
This is a message  
A message of love  
Love that moves from the inside out  
Love that never grows tired  
I come to you with strange fire  
Fire  
  
Mercenaries of the shrine  
Now who are you to speak for god  
With haughty eyes and lying tongues  
And hands that shed innocent blood  
Now who delivered you the power  
To interpret calvary  
You gamble away our freedom  
To gain your own authority  
  
Find another state of mind  
You know it's time we all learned  
To grab hold  
Strange fire burns  
With the motion of love  
  
Fire  
Fire  
  
When you learn to love yourself  
You will dissolve all the stones that are cast  
Now you will learn to burn the icing sky  
To melt the waxen mask  
I said to have the gift of true release  
This is a peace that will take you higher  
Oh I come to you with my offering  
I bring you strange fire  
  
This is a message  
A message of love  
Love that moves from the inside out  
Love that never grows tired  
I come to you with strange fire  
Fire  
Fire  
I come to you with strange fire

All the fur and fin will lose again  
Cause our better is their worst reckonin'  
And our fine-feathered friends will sing until they bleed  
And how will we replace that symphony?  
  
I've got the blackest boots, the whitest skin  
Satisfy my sugar tongue again  
Bring me love that buys us shoe-shine days  
Guilded verses for your ethylene  
And sing it to me free and clean  
  
All the kids come home with foreign limbs  
From hunting trips abroad they lose again  
And we'll teach them how to talk  
And whistle while they walk  
And do the dirty work of battle hymns  
  
I've got the blackest boots, the whitest skin  
Satisfy my sugar tongue again  
Sing me love that buys us shoe-shine days  
Guilded verses for your ethylene  
And sing it to me free and clean  
  
Drinking tea with milk and Janjaweed  
Pontificate on genocide or greed  
With a spoonful of descent  
For the orchestra of need  
Is just enough to please this colony  
  
I've got the blackest boots, the whitest skin  
Satisfy my sugar tongue again  
Bring me lullabies and morphine-dreams  
Belladonna with her atropine  
And sing it to me free and clean
