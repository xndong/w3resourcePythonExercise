She came to the coast from the show me state  
With her daddy's blue eyes and her mama's blind hate  
Guess she didn't know much but she knew the rules  
What she needed to learn, she would find in L. A.  
Not back in that school  
Didn't wanna read about it  
Guess she wanted to see  
Carolea, she's carolea  
Yeah, yeah, never quite sure what she wanted to be  
Just a little girl alone in a big bad place  
With a devious mind and a beautiful face  
Ever since she was a baby she learned how to play  
Wanted money in her hands from the easiest way  
All her friends said, stop girl, you can't pay the price  
But the hard way out don't appeal to the beast inside  
She don't wanna hear about the better life  
Guess she's ready to be  
Hey, carolea  
  
She never tells the truth to the folks back east  
Truth about the drugs and the men she gets paid to please  
Well they don't know  
Yeah, they don't see  
Yeah, that finally now after all these years  
She's let the beast inside roam free  
Carolea

She lost her focus yesterday  
She lost her focus in the sun  
She sits and stares at it for hours  
She says she likes to go outside  
She gets hung up on the wind  
She gets lost inside the happy noise  
  
Sometimes I don't understand her  
Sometimes I don't want to  
Understand her  
  
She says no no no no  
She don't want no double life  
She says I should know why  
She seems happier at night  
Her color TV and her chemical smile  
  
I don't want to know the reason  
I don't want to know the reason why  
  
She says  
Jesus owes her money  
She says  
That the angels are her friends  
  
What in the hell does that mean?  
  
She's got the chemical smile

Yes I hate the way I feel and it makes no sense  
Five months gone and all I got  
Pretty pink flowers on my chain link fence  
I don't like what it means  
Cause I know there's more to come  
I can't go home without  
Chrysanthemum  
  
I walk around lost and I don't know why  
I don't see the faces or the places I should recognize  
It's like that dream where it feels like home but it don't look right  
Yes I will look everywhere tonight  
I will not stop till I make things right  
And I can't go home till I see the sun  
I can't go home without  
Chrysanthemum  
No I can't go home without  
Chrysanthemum

I want you to stay the way you are, skinny legs and all  
I know the time is coming when the boys will begin to call  
I wish that I could hurt for you when you are learning how to fall  
You are the reason that I am alive today  
You are the reason that I have changed my life in a wonderful way  
I can see the passion that is growing inside of you  
I can see the sadness that throws a shadow down on everything you do  
I wish I was the man you thought I was  
Back when life was new for you  
You don't know what it's like to feel a love like this  
You don't know what it's like to feel this kind of helplessness  
You don't know what it's like to be weak  
I hope you never know  
I don't want you to be like me  
I want you to be clean  
Clean  
You are going to find a reason to hate me someday  
You are going to find a reason to push me away  
You are going to find reasons to blame me for your pain  
I hope you never lose the magic that is big inside of you  
I hope you never do the ridiculous things that I used to do  
I hope you never know my disease  
Never being good enough  
I don't want you to be like me  
I want you to be clean  
I want you to be clean  

I'm standing here on the ground  
The sky above won't fall down  
See no evil in all directions  
Resolution of happiness  
Yeah, things have been dark for too long  
I don't change for you  
Don't change a thing for me  
Yeah, don't change for you  
Don't change a thing for me  
I found a love I had lost  
It was gone for too long  
Hear no evil in all directions  
Execution of bitterness  
Message received loud and clear  
  
I'm standing here on the ground  
The sky above won't fall down  
See no evil in all directions  
Resolution of happiness  
Yeah, things have been dark for too long

Kathy please just go away  
Don't let Hazel see you when you're high  
Just take a walk to your sleazy bar  
Come back after I've come down  
  
Cross the street  
On your knees  
Makes me ashamed  
It's hard to sleep  
I can't shake your pain  
You get high, you'd just throw it away  
  
Hey Kathy please give me a break  
I told you not to come here when you're drunk again  
I'm sober now just 30 days  
All alone and working hard to stay that way  
  
Cross the street  
On your knees  
Makes it hard  
It's hard to see  
I can't shake your pain  
  
You get high, you'd just throw it away  
Kathy please, yeah yeah  
I don't want to see you when you're down  
  
Just leave me be and go away  
You're not going to pull me down  
I won't let you throw it away

I shake the dust from this small town  
I turn and follow the western wind down  
I go and pack up my shiny things  
And go yeah just go  
  
I'll find a new life in old L.A.  
Yeah stupid happy with everything  
I pulled myself down so easily  
I know I know I know  
  
I met Electra when living down  
Saw her spinning around and around  
I never knew much about her past  
I knew enough that I didn't ask  
living isn't a simple thing  
  
I know  
No one ever said it's supposed to be  
I know  
July she lied  
  
Living isn't a simple thing for me  
I know ways to make it easier

Evergleam and I know why God is good and Jesus loves me  
Heaven lives and I know where  
  
Sounds to me a not so easy chair falling free and living down  
Stringing out and over and happy  
  
Evergleam and I know why it isn't real and I'm not going to break  
Not going to break  
  
Don't die don't give in to it no way no way  
Please don't leave me  
  
Evergleam and I know how pulling hair and breaking voices  
Spin the wheel it will give you now  
  
Spinning wills don't give you choices  
Give away the spark inside, you give away the shining prize  
Evergleam and I know how it isn't real and I'm not going to break  
  
I'm not going to break  
No way, I'm not gonna break  
I'm not gonna break  
No way  
  
Evergleam, everywhere, ever weird, everyone  
Evergleam, everywhere, everything  
I'm not going away, not going away, not going away  
No way, I'm not gonna break, not gonna break  
No way, I'm not gonna break  
I won't see you there I'm not going away  
No way, no way, no way

You put yourself in stupid places  
Yes I think you know it's true  
Situations where it's easy to look down on you  
I think you like to be the victim  
I think you like to be in pain  
I think you make yourself a victim  
Almost every single day  
  
[Chorus]  
You do what you do  
You say what you say  
You try to be everything to everyone  
You know all the right people  
You play all the right games  
You always try to be  
Everything to everyone  
  
Yeah you do it again  
You always do it again  
  
You say they taught you how to read and write  
They taught you how to count  
I say they taught you how to buy and sell  
Your own body by the pound  
I think you like to be their simple toy  
I think you love to play the clown  
I think you are blind to the fact  
That the hand you hold  
Is the hand that holds you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall  
Yeah why won't you ever learn  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall  
I wonder if you will ever learn  
  
Why won't you ever learn  
  
Come on now  
Do that stupid dance for me  
  
You do what they tell you to do  
You say what they say  
You try to be everything to everyone  
  
You jump through the big hoop  
You play all the right games  
You try to be  
Everything to everyone  
  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall  
Yeah you do it again  
Spin around and fall down  
Do it again  
You stumble and you fall

Jessie was the prom queen back in nineteen ninety-five  
Punk and super pretty like a goddess on the outside  
She was sweet and funny, popular and cool  
It's got to be a drag when you peak in high school  
  
She left college and she never went back  
She posed for Playboy, made her think that she could act  
Ten years looking for the luck  
Chased her dreams in Cali but her acting kinda sucked  
  
Now she's pushing thirty five, working at Starbucks  
Oh well, nowhere to go but up  
  
Bill and Bobby Ann, Tiffany and Mike  
They seemed to be the kids that did everything right  
Now the boys are doing time for robbing a Korean store  
The girls smoke pot and do internet porn  
  
Bobby's little brother Brett always talked smack  
He learned that you can go too far and never get back  
He was drinking at the wrong place at the wrong time  
He said the wrong thing to the wrong guy  
He got himself stabbed in his one good eye  
  
Life goes south when pretty goes away  
The best that you can get is when you're falling in a good way  
  
Good enough is never enough  
Good enough is never enough  
  
There was nowhere to go but up  
There was nowhere to go but up  
There was nowhere to go  
  
Jimmy found God, Jimmy lost a leg  
Amy married well to a man she hates  
Katie bought a strip club, makes a lot of dough  
Alex sold drugs now he has his own reality show  
  
Life goes south when pretty goes away  
The best that you can get is when you're falling in a good way  
Life goes south when pretty goes away  
The best that you can get is when you're falling in a good way  
  
Good enough is never enough  
Good enough is never enough  
Good enough is never enough  
There was nowhere to go but up

Father of mine  
Tell me where have you been  
You know I just closed my eyes  
My whole world disappeared  
Father of mine  
Take me back to the day  
When I was still your golden boy  
Back before you went away  
  
I remember the blue skies  
Walking the block  
I loved it when you held me high  
I loved to hear you talk  
You would take me to the movie  
You would take me to the beach  
You would take me to a place inside  
That is so hard to reach  
  
Father of mine  
Tell me where did you go  
You had the world inside your hand  
But you did not seem to know  
Father of mine  
Tell me what do you see  
When you look back at your wasted life  
And you don't see me  
  
I was ten years old  
Doing all that I could  
It wasn't easy for me  
To be a scared white GIRL  
In a BAD neighborhood  
Sometimes you would send me a birthday card  
With a five dollar bill  
I never understood you then  
And I guess I never will  
  
Daddy gave me a name  
My dad he gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
Daddy gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
My dad gave me a name  
  
Father of mine  
Tell me where have you been  
I just closed my eyes  
And the world disappeared  
Father of mine  
Tell me how do you sleep  
With the children you abandoned  
And the wife I saw you beat  
  
I will never be safe  
I will never be sane  
I will always be weird inside  
I will always be lame  
  
Now I'm a grown GIRL  
With a KIDS of my own  
And I swear I WONT TELL THEM  
All the pain I have known  
  
Daddy gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
My dad gave me a name  
Then he walked away  
My dad gave me a name  
Then he walked away

You were shining in a white light  
Like a fairytale movie star  
Never really thought I would find snow white drinking in a downtown bar  
You were underneath the white light  
Like a vision in a deep dark place  
Never really thought I would fall for a country girl with an angel's face  
  
Aw everything fades away  
The world changes every day  
When I think about you, it makes me want to say  
  
Glorious  
Glorious  
You are glorious  
  
We were walkin' in the white sun  
Growing up and throwin' down loud  
There was silver in our eyes and we didnt know why,  
The power of the north so proud  
We were lost inside a long dark summer  
Headed down a no where road  
Looking for a light in the middle of the night,  
A place that felt like home  
  
I know everything fades away  
The world changes everyday  
When I think about you, and what we had,  
It makes me want to say  
  
Glorious  
Glorious  
You are to me  
Glorious  
Yeah this glorious life has never been what it seems  
I was asleep when I was living the dream  
Living the dream  
I know I was living the dream  
  
I think about the time in the city  
Running away trying to live free  
I could never believe that you wanted to be with me  
We'd wait in the cold for the last bus home  
Sleeping with your arms around me  
The world is never what it seems to be  
I was living the life when  
I should have been living the dream  
  
Glorious  
Should've been living the dream  
Glorious  
Should've been living the dream  
Glorious  
I know I never understood how much you would mean to me  
Now I know I was living the dream  
Glorious  
I know I was living the dream  
Glorious  
I know I know I was living the dream  
Glorious  
I know this glorious live has never been what it seems  
I was walkin' around half asleep when I was living the dream

Yeah live and let live motherfuckers,  
I'm a do me you do you. You're all a bunch of haters.  
  
Oh  
Oh  
  
I don't like the way that you talk to me  
When you tell me how it's gonna be  
And I don't like the way that you smile at me  
When you tell me what is wrong with me  
Sometimes I wish you would go away  
Go away and never ever come back  
I don't like the mean and vindictive things you do  
It makes me want to hate on you  
  
Yeah it's got me sad  
I'm kinda stressed  
You got me feeling anxious  
I'm always depressed  
And I don't want to play this game of tug of war  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore  
  
Oh  
  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore, anymore  
No  
No I don't wanna be with a hater  
You are such a hater  
  
I don't like the way that you never take the blame  
For absolutely anything  
And I don't like the way that you put me through hell  
For all those things you do yourself  
Sometimes I wish I could disappear  
Fade away into a happy new life  
I don't like the way that you're always telling lies  
You talk about me all the time  
  
I hear you talk  
You are such a bore  
I see the way you look  
I think you look like a witch  
I know you know  
I know the way you were before  
  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore  
Whoa, oh  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore,  
Anymore  
No no  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you  
Hater, hater  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you  
Hater, hater  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore  
Anymore  
Oh  
Anymore, anymore,  
No no  
I don't wanna play this game,  
No I don't wanna play games, games, uh  
  
You're a hypocrite  
Yeah you lie to me  
You use what you don't understand  
You embarrass me  
Yeah you're beautiful  
In an ugly way  
Hey the sex  
Was never that good anyway  
  
It's got me down  
And I'm super stressed  
Been taking medication  
I'm always depressed  
I don't want to fight you in this tug of war  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore  
Whoa whoa  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you anymore, anymore  
Whoa whoa  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you  
Hater hater hater  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you  
Hater hater hater hater  
I don't wanna be with a hater like you  
Hater hater  
Hater  
Hater

Time stops when the whispers blare  
The voices drop hard but the eyes still stare  
The world resolves into a death's head grin  
Because I walk with pride  
With a black girlfriend  
My mom said not to bring her around  
Cause she's black  
My Family would put her down  
I'll break the white trash ties that bind  
Trade a love so pure for a hate so blind  
She said she said  
Forget the fact that I don't  
Look like you  
She said, she said  
You're possessed with a power  
Bigger than the pain  
Time stops when we lie so close  
In my room where we share  
What no one knows  
From the day that we start  
Until the day that we end  
I know I know I know now  
We will never find a place  
Where we could just fit in  
Me and my black girlfriend  
She said- she said  
Fend for yourself, you're alone  
She said, she said  
You are possessed with a power  
Bigger than the pain  
A power bigger than the pain  
Heartspark Dollarsign

She is everywhere I am  
Yeah when I don't want her to be there  
I kinda want to leave in a hurry  
She's walking on the city  
Heavy in her monster boots  
I hear her calling my name  
  
I hide behind the people that I want to be  
I hear her calling my name  
I can see the future when she tells me how it's going to be  
She is perpetual Kathy  
All shake and happy in her brand new skin  
She is perpetual Kathy  
She is always the same  
  
She is everything that I'm not  
Strong and happy with the sound of the rhythm inside  
I do not want to be a broken record,  
But I don't want to live in the shadow of a twelve-step  
  
I hear her calling my name  
Next thing you know I think I'll want to be a better man  
I hear her calling my name  
Yeah, I used to be a devil but they never seemed to give a damn

You know I like to watch you sleep  
No I don't want to touch you  
You'll get mad at me  
No I don't want to think  
About the bad times  
Anyone could have a bad year.  
  
Now I don't want you to show me  
I do not want you to know me  
The way I used to be  
All these good things we have  
Would not mean a damn to me  
  
And I don't want to hear those words  
You feel you have to say  
When you find out how I used to be  
Back in the day  
  
Yeah, you know  
I like the way you slide  
Yeah, yes I like it when  
You do that slow glide  
Please don't bad talk all those good times  
Don't ask around cause baby  
That you do not want to hear  
  
I don't want you to make me  
Do not need you to break me  
Of all my childish ways  
I'm still the same you know  
Dumb, rock hard and good to go  
I still hear them voices calling me  
From back in the day  
  
Oh baby can't you see  
There ain't no place I'd rather be  
Then watching dirty movies  
In that happy room with you  
Sitting on that mattress in the corner  
Eating Chinese food  
I hear that voice in my head  
Say here we go again  
  
Ooh now here we go again  
  
I know you like the way I rock  
Sometimes I just need to drown out  
All that bad talk  
Yeah, I could not care less  
What your friends say  
Someone's always talking shit  
About the old days  
  
You do not need to remind me  
That I left it all behind  
Things I used to do  
I don't want that other life  
Cause I am so in love with you  
I can barely hear it calling me  
From back in the day  
  
Oh baby can't you see  
There ain't no place I'd rather be  
Then watching dirty movies  
In that happy room with you  
Sitting on that mattress in the corner  
Eating Chinese food  
I hear that voice in my head  
Say here we go again  
  
Yeah here we go again  
Oh baby here we go again  
Baby baby can't you see  
  
Yes I know you got some doubts  
I know you don't believe  
I know you think I'm crazy  
And I know you're just like me  
When I hear that voice inside me  
Makes me want to jump right in  
Saying here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go  
Here we go again  
  
Let's go watch some dirty movies  
Yes in that nasty little room  
Sit on that mattress while  
We eat that greasy Chinese food  
I hear that voice in my head  
Say here we go again  
  
Ooh baby here we go again

I used to know a girl  
She had two pierced nipples and a black tattoo  
We'd drink that Mexican beer  
We'd live on Mexican food  
Yeah, I wish I could go back  
Yes, back in time  
  
Esther used to be the kind of girl that you would  
Never leave  
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
She'd do anything  
  
I can hear them talking in the real world  
But they don't understand that I'm happy in hell  
With my heroin girl  
Yeah, with a heroin girl  
  
Esther used to be the kind of lover you would  
Never leave  
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
She'd do anything  
  
I can hear them talking in the real world  
But they don't understand that I'm losing myself  
In a white-trash hell  
Lost inside a heroin girl  
Yeah, with a heroin girl, yeah yeah  
  
They found her out in the fields  
About a mile from home  
Her face was warm from the sun  
But her body was cold  
I heard a policeman say  
Just another overdose  
Just another overdose!  
  
Esther used to be the kind of lover you would  
Never leave  
She'd do anything to give me what I need for my  
Disease  
She would do anything

I am the son, I am the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I am the son and heir of nothing in particular  
  
You shut your mouth, how can you say  
I go about things the wrong way  
I am human and I need to be loved  
Just like everybody else does  
  
I am the son, I am the heir  
Of a shyness that is criminally vulgar  
I'm the son and heir of nothing in particular  
  
[Chorus:]  
There is a club if you'd like to go  
You could meet someone who really loves you  
So you go and you stand on your own  
And you leave on your own  
And you go home and you cry and you want to die

It's a beautiful day, (Yeah)  
If you look up in the air, you can see the sky  
It's a beautiful day, (Yeah)  
  
If you stare at the sun, you will burn your eyes  
I do not believe in the lucky numbers  
I do not believe in the on the wishing on the star  
Yeah to tell you the truth,  
I know there is a good reason for all of your bad dreams  
You know all of its true  
People love to tell you things that will break your heart  
  
(Yeah people love to break your heart)  
(ah)  
(Yeah people love to break your heart)  
  
I do not believe in the things that I can not see  
No, I do not believe in the pretty disguise  
Tell you the you the truth,  
I know they want me to believe that they know what's best for me  
You know its true  
People love to hit you when you close your eyes  
  
(People love to hurt you when you close your eyes)  
(you will never see it coming)  
(yeah)  
( you will never see it coming)

People love to hurt you when you close your eyes

Everybody here in this small town  
Looks used and abused at bay  
Everybody here's looking outside in  
Seems like nothing ever changes  
  
Everybody, they just want to have a good time  
Everybody, they just want to forget  
Everybody wants to feel like they did  
When the sky looked blue  
And the world was perfect  
  
I don't care  
I just want to die pretty  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I don't want to live forever  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
  
"Ha ha ha ha"  
  
(Ugh)  
Yeah, I got to get the hell out of this town  
Everybody's looking upside-down  
Everybody here is looking for the same thing  
When it seems like nothing ever changes  
Everybody they just want to find a slow ride  
Everybody they just want to get by  
  
Everybody wants to feel like they did  
When the sky looked high  
And the world was simple  
  
I don't care  
I just want to die pretty  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I don't want to live forever  
I want to die a beautiful death  
  
I want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh (oh)  
I just want to die pretty  
Oh (oh)  
Sometimes I just want to die  
  
I just want to get lost in the moment  
I just want to get lost inside the city tonight  
I just want to get lost inside myself  
I don't care about nothing  
  
I just want to get lost in the motion  
I just want to get lost in my beautiful self  
I just want to get lost in the city  
I don't want to live forever  
I want to die a beautiful death  
  
I want to die a beautiful death  
Yes, I want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die a beautiful death  
I just want to die pretty  
  
"Oh yeah"

Here is the money that I owe you  
Yes you can pay the bills  
I will give you more  
When I get paid again  
  
I hate those people who love to tell you  
Money is the root of all that kills  
They have never been poor  
They have never had the joy of a welfare christmas  
  
I know we will never look back  
  
You say you wake up crying  
Yes and you don't know why  
You get up and you go lay down  
Inside my baby's room  
  
Yeah, I guess I'm doing OK  
I moved in with the strangest guy  
Can you believe he actually thinks  
That I am really alive  
  
I will buy you a garden  
Where your flowers can bloom  
I will buy you a new car  
Perfect shiny and new  
I will buy you that big house  
Way up in the west hills  
I will buy you a new life  
Yes I will  
  
Yes, I know all about that other guy  
The handsome man with athletic thighs  
I know about all the time before  
With that obsessive little rich boy  
  
They might make you think you're happy  
Yeah maybe for a minute or two  
They can't make you laugh  
No they can't make you feel the way that I do  
  
I will buy you a garden  
Where your flowers can bloom  
I will buy you a new car  
Perfect shiny and new  
I will buy you that big house  
Way up in the west hills  
I will buy you a new life  
I will buy you a new life  
  
I know we can never look back  
  
Will you please let me stay the night  
Will you please let me stay the night  
No one will ever know

Way up in the west hills

I'm on your time,  
Yeah you do that blue spark too,  
I do those that I fought,  
No one can push my buttons like you do.  
  
My weak arms can't hope to hold you,  
I'm on your time.  
  
Yeah I'm on your time,  
Yeah you really give me quite a muse,  
I say "I wish that you could just get over yourself", yeah yeah,  
You say we're in this for the abuse.  
  
I'm a reckless mile behind you,  
Baby you know I get so violent sometimes,  
My weak arms can't hope to hold you,  
I'm on your time.  
  
Yeah we will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget,  
What we do to each other,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget.  
  
Yeah we will never forget,  
No we will never forget.  
  
Oh I'm on your time,  
You said we can't go on this way,  
I say I wish that you could fix this broken thing in me,  
Cause there'll be a happy happy day,  
I'm a reckless mile behind you,  
Baby you know I get so fucked up inside,  
My weak arms can't hope to hold you,  
I'm on your time.  
  
Yeah yeah yeah,  
I'm on your time,  
Woah woah woah,

We will never forget,

We will never forget,  
What we do to each other,  
We will never forget,  
We will never forget.

I will I will live for a year or two  
Maybe just for a year  
I will die yes I will die  
I rest secure in that  
  
I am awful sure that this thing ain't no accident  
And I just can't believe that AIDS is just some act of God  
I will reach for you I will reach my hand  
  
No one will reach for me no one will touch my skin  
Yes I will accept I will accept my pain  
I don't deserve to die like this no one deserves to die like this  
  
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world  
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world  
Break the world  
  
I will not be denied, I will not be ignored  
I am not invisible anymore  
  
I will not be denied, I will not be ignored, I am real  
I won't go away, I am not invisible anymore  
  
Sometimes I get so mad I just want to break the world  
I get so mad I just want to break the world  
Break the world, break the world

Luther Jackson Green  
Lived in the apartment above me  
We smoked cigarettes on the stairs  
Tell me stories that white boys never hear  
  
Like when he found this shine  
He moved north in nineteen forty-nine  
On his tenth birthday daddy took him to town  
To see the Jackie Robinson play.  
  
It was a picture perfect day  
In the sunshine and the hate  
He didn't understand why all those  
People would say such awful things.  
  
His daddy said pay no attention to them  
Turnaround and watch the man play  
  
The one black man in the baseball field  
Was better in every way  
My daddy said if you wanna win in this world  
You gotta beat 'em the their own game.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Went to law school in nineteen sixty-three  
In the summer between he worked in Alabama  
With Martin Luther King  
  
He met a girl on a summer night  
He fell hard when they saw each other's eyes  
There were people in town that really didn't  
Like that he was black and she was white  
  
They found her in the ditch  
A little outside of town  
Some stupid man was blastin' about it  
So Luther beat him down  
  
He looked him in the eye, spit in his face and  
He turned and walked away.  
He knew he was better than all the hate  
He knew he was bigger than all the pain  
He knew there's a time to fight and a time to walk away  
He knew until he changed the rules  
Ooh yeah they beat 'em at their own game.  
  
He never did lose that feeling inside  
You could hear it in his voice  
You could see it in his eyes  
  
Luther moved out West to live  
When his wife passed away  
He lives right next door to his son  
So he can watch his grandchild play.  
  
Luther Jackson Green  
Watched election night with me.  
We put a black man in the White House  
A thing he never thought he'd see.  
  
Even though he never cried  
I could see tears in his eyes  
He had dreamed about this moment  
Every single day of his life.  
  
Yeah Luther died that night in his sleep  
But he lived long enough to see,  
America become the kind of place  
He always wanted it to be.  
  
He said you could never forget the day  
That we beat 'em at their own game!  
  
Yeah just like Jackie Robinson (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta be bigger than all the hate (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta be better than all the pain (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta find a better way (just like Jackie Robinson)  
  
Gotta beat 'em at their own game (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta beat 'em at their own game (just like Jackie Robinson)  
Gotta beat 'em at their own game (just like Jackie Robinson)  
(Just like Jackie Robinson)

There is this rumor about  
They say you're leaving Nehalem  
Ever since our baby died  
  
You've been seen with another guy  
The whole damn town is talking now  
They say you're leaving Nehalem  
Hey don't you want me to go?  
Hey don't you want me?  
  
They say you're losing your mind  
They say you're leaving Nehalem  
You know how the bad words get around  
Big noise in a hard small town  
  
Tell me if you want me to go  
Just tell me if you want me  
They say you're leaving Nehalem  
They say you're leaving me  
  
Yeah, I know you need to break away  
I don't give a fuck about what those people say  
I hope you find everywhere you go  
All the good things that you need to know  
They say you're losing your mind  
  
They say you're leaving Nehalem  
There is this rumor out  
They say you're leaving Nehalem  
They say you're leaving me

Yeah they said you called me maybe yesterday  
I don't even have the strength to pick up the phone  
You wouldn't even know me since you went away  
The Prozac doesn't do it for me anymore  
Yeah you ought to take your medication every day  
Be a good dog, live life in a wonderful way  
  
Tell me why you want to be blind  
I don't want to be normal like you  
I know now every day  
I get closer to the place inside  
Where I can be normal too  
  
I heard those stupid people talk about you again  
I just have to laugh to keep from hurting bad  
Their simple minds just cannot seem to understand  
You are neurotic and depressed  
It doesn't mean that you're sad  
  
You walk around oblivious to everything  
You wear that party dress, black mascara  
Like you're queen for the day  
I will never be normal like you  
You walk around oblivious to everyone  
I see you walking slow and simple underneath the big black sun  
  
Tell me why you want to be blind  
I don't want to be normal like you  
I know now every day  
I get closer to the place inside  
Where I can be complacent  
I get closer to the place inside  
  
Where I can be sedated  
Yes I get closer to the place inside  
Where I can be normal too, I can be normal too  
I can be normal like you

Waste my time running in circles  
Waste my time going bad on the vine  
I spent the last year walking through the fire  
Now I do believe it's my turn to shine  
(Now it's my turn to shine)  
  
Waste my time walking in rythym  
Waste my time talking in rhyme  
I spent the last year in a Mexican freefall  
I do believe it's my turn to climb  
  
I used to think I was born to know trouble  
I used to think I was a born-again clown  
I used to think I had everybody guessing  
I looked like I was flying high when I was falling down  
  
Now I am taller than I used to be  
Now I am living again  
Now I like where I have found myself  
This is where I want to be now  
  
Now this is where I want to be  
Now this is where I want to be  
Now this is where I want to be  
  
I was falling free in Mexico  
Living on those taco bars and sweet sunshine  
Learning how to walk again in my own skin  
Learning the art of losing my mind  
  
I used to think I was born in a hurricane  
I used to think I was jumping jack flash  
I used to think I was a victim of circumstance  
Beating up on everyone all the time  
I should have been kicking myself  
In my own ass  
  
Now I don't worry about the future much  
Now I don't think about the past  
Now I'm learning how to laugh again  
This is where I want to be now  
  
Now I'm tired of the drama club  
Now I'm sick with all the hate  
Yeah, it's been one hell of a hard year  
This is where I want to be now  
This is where I want to be now  
I want to be now

Yeah right!  
  
Break down  
And shake for me  
Nothing ever is the way  
You want it to be  
Nothing even tastes right  
Now that it's over  
  
Break down  
And shake for me  
Don't write words  
Unless you want me to read them  
Nothing really matters  
Now that it's over  
  
Maybe we can be friends  
Now that we're older  
We can have fun  
Like we did in the early days  
Now that it's over  
  
Yeah right!  
  
Break down  
And shake for me  
Nothing ever seems  
The way it ought to be  
Nothing ever seems right  
Now that it's over  
  
Yeah now maybe we can be friends  
Maybe we can be closer  
We can have fun  
Like we did in the old days  
Now that it's over  
  
My bad dreams just don't seem the same  
Baby without you  
I wish you were willing to accept the blame  
Yeah for everything you do  
  
My nightmares just don't scare me now  
Baby without you  
I wish that I could find the words to tell  
In the best way possible  
You and your friends to go to hell  
  
Ooh, break up time  
Is never easy to do  
Nothing ever ends  
The way you want it to  
Nothing seems to make sense  
Now that it's over  
  
Yeah now maybe we can be friends  
Yeah now that you're leaving  
You can be nice to me  
Maybe I'm dreaming  
I am a lot better now than just OK  
Maybe I am just waking up  
In my own way  
Now that it's over  
  
Now that it's over  
  
My bad dreams just don't seem the same  
Baby without you  
I wish you were willing to accept the blame  
Yeah for all the shitty things you do  
Nightmares just don't scare me now  
Baby without you  
I wish that I could find the words to tell  
You to go politely go fuck yourself  
Yeah now that it's over  
  
Now that it's over [Repeat x4]

Jackson met a girl in a valley town  
They fell into a teenage love she'd grow to hate  
He's in prison now since he beat her down  
He got her pregnant and she made it go away  
Hey hey hey hey Pennsylvania  
Pennsylvania  
  
I got a card today from a girl I know  
She used to live alone in Philadelphia  
She had to leave the state for a choice she made  
She says she feels just like a hostage in her home  
Hey hey hey hey Pennsylvania  
Pennsylvania  
  
You can close your eyes you can fall and die  
You can make your laws and make it go away  
You can close your eyes but you can't make it go away  
Can't make it go away  
  
I just got a call from my uncle Mike  
He said he left his wife and he's not going back  
Said she changed her mind about a desire child  
I asked him if he wants a place mat or a wife  
Hey hey hey hey Pennsylvania  
Pennsylvania is wrong

I stand out breaking in the Portland rain  
I see the end there in your eyes as I watch you drive away  
I walk back blind into my cold dreamhouse  
And I think about the damage  
I put the big light out  
I sit down smoking on my basement floor  
I hear footsteps up above me  
They are right outside my front door  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you move up on top of me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as you whisper in my ear  
Baby, you know I love it when you call me baby  
I go upstairs and find my twelve-year-old  
She's got tears running down her face  
Sitting sad at my piano  
She sings soft words from that old Beatles song  
And I think about my yesterday and all the things I did wrong  
The only place that I want to be  
Is watching you sweet dream in bed right next to me  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I pull you near  
Don't give up on me  
Baby, can't you you see?  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Don't give up on me  
I wish I could make you see  
That I am changing everyday, trying to build a better me  
We could make this be the way it's supposed to be  
Don't give up on me  
I stand out in the rain where I watched you drive away  
I never thought I would live to see  
This fucked-up day  
I stand out in the rain in the middle of the night  
I wish that it could wash away the beast inside  
The only thing I want to do is kiss you when I am coming deep inside of you  
The only sound that I want to hear  
Is the rain against my window as I hold you  
Don't give up on me  
Oh baby, can't you see?  
We could make this be the way it used to be  
Don't give up on me  
I wish I could make you see that I am changing everyday  
Trying to build a better me  
We could make this be the way it's supposed to be  
Don't give up on me  

There was smoke in the air  
When he came around and saw  
He was really alone  
  
Memories look like blood in the water  
Sweet and ugly pain  
Just like confetti in the rain  
  
He was known for his bedside manner  
He wanted to believe  
That people only hear what they see  
  
He had a good time being the bad guy  
He didn't want to understand why  
That old song makes him cry  
  
I remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
A little heaven when the sun goes down  
Walking hand and hand down on the Promenade  
  
He was alone in a dark room overlooking the mall  
With a gun in his hand  
And no one to call  
  
He was waiting for a reason to fade and run  
Just like photos in the window  
That turn blue in the sun  
  
People used to call it a breakdown  
Now he medicates to make it go away  
Yeah yeah people used to call it a mid life crisis  
He just sits and looks at pictures of himself  
From way back in the day  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Getting stupid in a stolen car  
Making love in the garage behind the Promenade  
  
Think I need to slow down  
Think I need to slow my roll  
  
I need to put the gun down  
I feel so lost  
I feel so out of control  
  
I broke myself in pieces to make my name  
I broke those people dumb enough  
To get in my way  
  
Now I look in the mirror  
And I can't see me  
How can you swallow the world  
And still be hungry  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Holding hands with my dad and my mom  
Walking in the lights to see Santa  
On the Promenade  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
  
Remember  
Remember  
  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God  
Remember when it felt like we were walking with God

Santa baby, just slip a guitar under the tree for me  
Been an awful good boy  
Santa baby, hurry down the chimney tonight  
Santa baby, a '54 convertible too, light blue  
Yeah, I'll wait up for you dear  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the girlies that I haven't kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you'd check off my christmas list  
Santa baby, I want a yacht and really that's not a lot  
I've been an angel all year  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Santa cutie, one little thing that I need, the deed  
To a platinum mine  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Come and trim my christmas tree  
With some decorations bought at tiffany's  
I really do believe in you  
Let's see if you believe in me too  
Santa baby, forgot to mention one little thing, a ring  
Yeah, I don't mean on the phone  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  
Santa cutie, fill my stocking with a duplex, and checks  
Sign your x on the line  
Santa baby, now hurry down the chimney tonight  
  
Think of all the fun I've missed  
Think of all the girlies that I could've kissed  
Next year I could be just as good  
If you'd check off my christmas list  
Santa baby, forgot to mention just one little thing, a ring  
I don't mean on the phone  
Santa baby, so hurry down the chimney tonight  

I am still living with your ghost  
Lonely and dreaming of the west coast  
I don't want to be your downtime  
I don't want to be your stupid game  
  
With my big black boots and an old suitcase  
I do believe I'll find myself a new place  
I don't want to be the bad guy  
I don't want do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
I just want to see some palm trees  
I will try and shake away this disease  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
We can live beside the ocean  
Leave the fire behind  
Swim out past the breakers  
Watch the world die  
  
I am still dreaming of you face  
Hungry and hollow for all the things you took away  
I don't want to be your good time  
I don't want to be your fall-back crutch anymore  
  
I'll walk right out into a brand new day  
Insane and rising in my own weird way  
I don't want to be the bad guy  
I don't want to do your sleepwalk dance anymore  
  
I just want to feel some sunshine  
I just want to find some place to be alone  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Yeah watch the world die  
Yeah watch the world die  
Yeah watch the world die  
Yeah watch the world die

"Hm, just like science fiction, no one knows what the fuck they're talking  
About, heh, there's always one in every crowd"  
  
There is always one in every crowd  
You can hear the voices when you're alone  
They sound like metal on metal  
Obnoxious and loud  
  
Don't let go  
Don't listen to the sound  
Of those people you know  
Slowly falling apart  
And falling down now  
Everything is falling down now  
(Now now now)  
  
When I think I'm alone  
I watch the news  
On my girlfriends TV  
It's like a bad B-movie  
Aw sometimes I can't comprehend  
All the stupid things that I see  
  
So don't let go  
You can't believe your eyes  
Yeah, when everything they show you  
Just makes you want to cry  
And you don't want to know  
That you need to remember  
Life is always getting better  
(Better better)  
So don't let go  
(Go go go)  
  
There is always one in every crowd  
Yeah, you see them when you think you're alone  
It all just seems like science fiction  
No one knows what they are talking about  
  
So don't let go  
Don't listen to the sound  
Of those people you know  
Slowly falling apart  
And falling down now  
  
You need to remember  
Life is always getting better  
Life is always getting better  
Life is always getting better  
For a while

She don't care about my car  
She don't care about my money  
And that's real good because I don't got a lot to spend  
But if I did it wouldn't mean nothin'  
She likes me for me  
Not because I look like Tyson Beckford  
With the charm of Robert Redford  
Oozing out my ears  
But what she sees  
Are my faults and indecisions  
My insecure conditions  
And the tears upon the pillow that I she'd  
She don't care about my big screen  
Or my collection of dvd's  
Things like that just never mattered much to her  
Plus she don't watch to much T. V.  
And she don't care that I can fly her  
To places she ain't never been  
But if she really wants to go  
I think deep down she knows that  
All she has to say is when  
She likes me for me  
Not because I hang with Leonardo  
Or that guy who played in "Fargo"  
I think his name is Steve  
She's the one for me  
  
And I just can't live without her  
My arms belong around her  
And I'm so glad I found her once again  
And I'm so glad I found her once again  
And I'm so glad I found her once again  
Gazing at the ceiling  
As we entertain our feelings in the dark  
The things that we're afraid of are gonna show us  
What we're made of in the end  
She likes me for me  
Not because I sing like Pavarotti  
Or because I am such a hottie  
I like her for her  
Not because she's phat like Cindy Crawford  
She has got so much to offer  
Why does she waste all her time with me  
There must be something there that I don't see  
She likes me for me  
Not because I'm tough like Dirty Hairy  
Make her laugh just like Jim Carrey  
Unlike the Cable Guy  
But what she sees  
Is that I can't live without her  
My arms belong around her  
And I'm so glad I found her once again  
Found her once again  
I'm so glad I found her once again  
On again

Diamonds and dust  
Poor man last, rich man first  
Lamborghinis, caviar  
Dry martinis, shangri-la  
I got a burnin' feelin' deep inside of me  
It's been burnin'  
But I'm gonna set it free  
  
I'm going in to sin city  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
Where the lights are bright  
Do the town tonight  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
  
Ladders and snakes  
Ladders give, snakes take  
Rich man, poor man, beggarman, thief  
You ain't got a hope in hell, yeah that's my belief  
  
Fingers freddy, diamond jim  
They're gettin' ready, cause I'm comin' in  
So spin that wheel, cut the crap, and roll those loaded dice  
Bring on the dancin' girls and put the champagne on ice  
  
I'm going in to sin city  
I'm gonna win in sin city  
Where the lights are bright  
Do the town tonight  
I'm going in to sin city

We were fading  
Like the bottom of a bad dream  
We were heading south  
Looking for a good time  
  
Faces look so pretty  
In the spotlight  
All blown out  
And bathed inside a world of white  
  
Sometimes I feel like I am holding it together  
Sometimes I feel like everything is fine  
Sometimes I feel like I'm out of control  
I feel like I am falling  
Like my life is on a slide, slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
  
It was sunny on the streets  
Down there by the water  
We would get hammered on the beach  
Right down by the water  
  
She was slightly out of reach  
A rich man's only daughter  
I think she slept with me  
Just so she could piss off her father  
  
I am elastic I am easy with the damage  
I am ecstatic I am hungry for the climb  
Sometimes I feel like I am falling apart  
I feel like I am falling  
Like my life is on a slide, slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
  
I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to act my age  
I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to control my rage  
  
My heart is racing and  
I am losing my mind  
Sometimes I feel like my life is on a slide  
Slide  
  
Those faces look so scary  
In the harsh light  
All blown out  
And bathed inside a world of white  
  
We were shining  
Like the good part of a bad time  
We were laughing, happy  
Just to be along for the ride  
  
Sometimes I feel like I am really lucky  
I have made it through  
Bruised and scarred  
And half alive  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm out of control  
I feel like I am falling  
Like my life is on a slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
Slide  
  
Yes I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to act my age  
Yes I know it's wrong but  
I just can't seem to control my rage  
  
My heart is racing and  
I am losing my mind  
Sometimes I feel like my life is on a slide

This is a song about Susan  
This is a song about the girl next door  
This is a song about the everyday occurrences that make you feel like letting
go  
Yes I think we've got a problem  
  
So much for the afterglow  
This is a song about Susan  
This is a song about the way things are  
This is a song about the scary things you see from the corner of your eyes  
Don't you wonder why?  
  
We never talk about the future  
We never talk about the past anymore  
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to
know  
I guess the honeymoon is over  
  
So much for the afterglow  
I remember we could talk about anything  
I remember when we used to want to hang out  
We never talk about the future  
We never talk about the past anymore  
We never ask ourselves the questions to the answers that nobody even wants to
know  
  
Oh well oh well oh well  
So much for the afterglow  
Oh well oh well oh well  
Yes I guess we need the drama  
So much for the afterglow

Sometimes I get to a point where  
I don't give a damn about  
anything... anymore  
  
Sometimes I get to a point where  
I feel numb and I just don't care  
  
Sometimes I feel like I just  
don't care  
  
I sit in my car  
and listen to the radio  
  
I think about the past  
and it seems so long ago  
  
I know the pain  
is slowly going to fade  
  
This life is going to get better  
(Things are going to be better)  
  
I wait until  
my ex-wife has gone away  
  
I walk around the house  
Getting lost inside the old days  
  
I see the picture where  
everybody's smiling...  
  
I know...  
I got to keep it on the inside  
  
I want to get lost  
from my life sometimes  
  
Sit on the side  
and watch the world go by  
  
I want to get lost  
and I don't know why  
  
Sometimes I want to get lost  
and I don't know why  
  
(Sometimes I want to get lost  
and dream for a while)  
  
Waiting for my little girl  
Waiting on the school bus  
  
We're going to the movies  
Yeah just the two of us  
  
Sit inside the dark dream  
for a while  
  
Our life is going to get better  
(Yeah it's going to be better)  
  
I wake up weird  
in the middle of the night  
  
I walk up the floor  
until my mind gets right  
  
I think about the past  
and it makes me want to cry  
  
I know...  
I got to keep it on the inside  
  
I want to get lost  
from my life sometimes  
  
Sit on the side  
and watch world go by  
  
I want to get lost in the dark  
and dream for awhile  
  
Just sit inside a dark room  
and dream for awhile  
  
The only thing that ever makes  
sense to me  
Is the words to a song from  
an American movie  
  
The only thing that ever made  
made sense in my life  
Is the sound of my  
little girl laughing  
Alive and happy in  
the summertime  
  
I am just like everyone I know  
  
I am afraid of things that I  
don't know  
  
I am afraid of ever really  
being alone  
  
I want to find myself a brand  
new heart  
  
I want to find a girl  
and make a brand new start  
  
I want to find a girl and get lost  
in the dark  
  
The only thing that ever makes  
sense to me  
Is the words to a song from  
an American moive  
  
The only thing that ever made  
made sense in my life  
Is the sound of my  
little girl laughing  
Through the window of a  
summer night  
  
I sit alone in the backyard  
Wishing I could be inside  
  
Just the sound of my  
little girl laughing  
Makes me happy just to be alive  
  
Sometimes I am happy  
just to be alive

I been north, I been east, to the California beach  
There's only one place I know where to find you  
And you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I know, waste no time gettin' so close to you  
And you remember the way to find out that I wanted to thank you  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh baby needs some brand new shoes  
You get out on the street, you got nothing to lose  
I feel your crazy and everyone says it  
Southern girls, you got nothing to lose  
  
I've been up, I've been down  
I've been weak, I've been strong  
But I've never met someone like you  
And you'll never know that if I found you I'd thank you  
You say hump and I'll jump  
You say go and I know, waste no time gettin' so close to you  
And all you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You might think this boy he loves you, Southern girl  
You make it hard, oh so hard  
I been north, I been east, to the California beach  
There's only one place I know where to find you  
And you Southern girls got a way with your words and you show it  
  
[Chorus]

I remember when you seemed real shiny with the sweat of your voice  
Shaky hands super load and teenage mouth  
We were all charmed and taken by your talk  
Now I shudder when I hear the rhythm of your walk  
Now I've got no place to go I've got no place to go  
I've got no one nowhere no one  
  
I have given up on the sparkle that I saw in your eyes  
I have sinned the sin of wanting more  
The belly fire pulls the spirit from the corporate whore  
I'm embarrassed by the plaid you wear  
  
If I were you I'd hide behind that stupid bleach blond hair  
Now I've got no place to go, I've got no place to go  
I've got no one, nowhere, no one  
  
I have given up on the sparkle that I saw in you  
Yeah, that simple minded sparkle that I thought I saw  
Yes, I have wondered why you changed  
I like it when you were super loud  
I have wondered why you changed  
I like it when you were super loud  
  
Now I've got nowhere to go, I've got no place to go  
I've got no one, nowhere, no one  
Now I've got no place to go, I've got no place to go  
I've got no one, nowhere, no one  
I wonder if you're giving in, tell me why you're giving in  
Tell me why you're giving in

Here he comes, here comes Speedracer  
Hes a demon on wheels  
Hes a demon and hes gonna be chasing after someone  
Hes gaining on you so you better look alive  
Hes busy revving up the powerful mach-5  
And when the odds are against him and theres dangerous work  
You can bet your life Speedracer will see it through  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
  
Hes off and flying as he guns his car around the track  
Hes jamming down the pedal like hes never coming back  
Adventures waiting just ahead!  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Go Speedracer, go  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
Go Speedracer  
Go Speedracer, go  
  
[Repeats]  
Go  
  
Here he comes, here comes Speedracer  
Hes a demon on wheels  
Hes a demon on wheels

Never been here never coming back  
Never want to think about the things  
That happened today  
Want to lay down on the warm ground  
I think I'm going to need  
A little time to myself  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now  
I ask you for a slow ride  
Going nowhere  
You look like Satan  
You ask me if I want to get high  
Couple of bags down in old town  
You tie your arm and  
Ask me if I wanted to drive  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now  
Last thing I recall  
I was in the air  
I woke up on the street  
Crawling with my strawberry burns  
Ten long years in a straight line  
They fall like water  
Yes, I guess I fucked up again  
Don't fall down now  
You will never get up  
Don't fall down now

Let's just drive your car  
We could drive all day  
Let's just get the hell away from here  
  
For I am sick again  
Just plain sick to death  
Of the sound of my own voice  
We could leave behind  
Another wasted year  
Just get some cheap red wine  
  
And just go flying  
We could do the things  
All the things you wanted to  
No one cares about us anyway  
I think I lost my smile  
I think you lost yours too  
We have lost the power to make each other laugh  
  
Let's just leave this place  
And go to Summerland  
Just a name on the map  
Sounds like heaven to me  
  
We could find a town,  
Be just how we want to be  
No one here really cares about us anyway  
We could find a place,  
Make it what we want it to be  
No one really gives a fuck about us anyway  
We could live  
Live just like we want to live  
No one here really cares about us anyway  
We could be  
  
Everything we want to be  
We could get lost in the Fall  
Glimmer Sparkle and Fade  
The Sparkle and Fade  
Fall Glimmer Sparkle and Fade  
  
Forget about our jobs at the record store  
Forget about all the losers that we know  
Forget about all the memories that keep you down  
Forget about them  
  
We could lose them in the  
Sparkle and Fade  
We could leave them behind  
In the Sparkle and Fade  
Yeah Sparkle and Fade  
Fall Glimmer Sparkle and Fade

I know where you go when you want to fall  
Why do you want to be broken?  
I know where you go when you want to fall  
Yes your friends they tell me everything  
  
Yes I know where you go  
Yes I know what you do  
Yes I know the awful things you say and who you say them to  
Yes I know where you go  
Yes I know what you do  
  
I know how you feel, you get crazy inside  
They say it runs in the family  
I know just how you feel when you get crazy inside  
Your mom she said that you are just like me  
  
I can see it in your eyes  
I can see your shaky hands  
Yes I think you think I'm stupid  
You don't think I understand  
Yes I see you and I see myself when I was a younger man  
  
When you were a child  
You were happy and free  
You were my reason to live  
I would die when you smiled at me  
  
I can still see you  
I remember you painting  
Sunflowers in your room  
  
I know where you go when you want to fall  
Hey don't you want to be happy?  
I know where you go when you want to fall  
Your useless friends, they tell me everything  
  
Everything  
I see you run around in circles  
I see you digging your own hole  
I see you fight the fights you just can't win  
I see you losing self control  
What it does to me deep down inside I hope you will never know  
  
When you were a child  
You were happy and free  
You were my reason to live  
I would die when you smiled at me  
  
I can still see you  
Painting flowers on the wall  
I remember you happy  
I remember it all  
All I want to remember  
Pretty pictures on the wall  
I remember you happy  
I remember it all  
All I want to remember  
Sunflowers in your room

Roll and tumble with your big heart falling  
You're rolling tumbling alone  
Beats forever what your dirty hand's holding  
You reach for something you will never know  
Heard you singing in a taco bell bathroom  
Heard you singing a cheap trick song  
Yeah, we sang surrender all the way the county line  
When I listen to that music  
It makes me think of summertime  
Yeah, that acid summer  
We were wasted and happy  
We were laughing in the sunshine  
(sunshine)  
  
Twist and turn with your bright eye shining  
Twist and turn in the california sun  
Wait forever for the life you dream of  
You wait for something that will never come  
You twist and turn in the slow motion daydream  
You twist and turn in your own sweet hell  
I don't get too close to the fire anymore  
But when I think of you now, it makes me think of summertime  
Yeah, that acid summer  
We were wasted and happy  
We laughing in the sunshine  
Laughing in the sunshine  
Laughing in the sunshine  
Laughing in the sunshine  
In the sunshine  
  
Twist and turn with your bright eyes shining  
Twist and turn in the california sun  
Wait forever for the life you dream of  
You wait for something that will never come  
You twist and turn in the slow motion freefall  
You twist and turn in your own good time  
I can't watch you twisting and turning anymore  
No I never thought a good time would turn into a lifestyle  
No I just can't watch you wait anymore  
But when I think of that summertime  
It always seem to make me smile  
(smile)  
Yeah, that acid summer  
We were wasted and happy  
We were laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)  
We were laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)  
Laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)  
Laughing in the sunshine  
(go!)

With you it's always lies, lies, lies  
I know that you have lied to me so don't even try to play now  
You said you didn't do those type of things, but you went and did them anyway  
Now there is nothing you can say to me  
There is nothing you can do now  
The awful truth is that you broke my heart  
And now I'm going to break yours, too  
You get what you pay for  
You gotta own what you sell  
I know I will forgive you when I give you  
Just a taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
All that trouble you have put me through, it will come back to you because...  
I know you fucked around on me  
I kind of caught you in the act  
You made a choice to take us to this place, and now there is no going back  
I don't want to be vindictive now  
I don't want to make you sad  
But you broke the rules of this game that we play  
Now it's my turn to be bad  
You know they say you get what you pay for  
You gotta own what you sell  
I think I'm going to like it when I give you  
Just a taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
All the trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you  
With the taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
Now all that trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you  
There is nothing you can say to me  
There is nothing you can do  
You had to go and get some on the side  
Now I'm going to go and get some, too  
You get what you pay for  
You gotta own what you sell  
I am going to look like Satan when I give you  
Just a taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
Now all the trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you  
With the taste of hell  
A little flavor of the pain that you gave me  
A little taste of hell  
Now all the trouble you have put me through  
It will come back to you  

Guess who just got back today?  
Those wild-eyed boys that had been away  
Haven't changed, haven't much to say  
But man, I still think those cats are great  
  
They were asking if you were around  
How you was, where you could be found  
I told them you were living downtown  
Driving all the old men crazy  
  
The boys are back in town  
  
You know the chick that used to dance a lot  
Every night she'd be on the floor shaking what she'd got  
Man when I tell you she was cool, she was red hot  
I mean she was steaming  
  
That night over at Johnny's place  
Well this chick got up and she slapped Johnny's face  
Man we just fell about the place  
If that chick don't want to know, forget her  
  
Friday night they'll be dressed to kill  
Down at Dino's bar and grill  
The drink will flow and blood will spill  
If the boys want to fight, you'd better let them  
  
That jukebox in the corner blasting out my favorite song  
The nights are getting warmer, it won't be long  
It won't be long till summer comes  
Now that the boys are here again  
  
The boys are back in town

You pull me down  
To the floor  
Of our apartment  
  
A little while later  
We are laughing  
At our carpet burns  
  
I like the way  
That it glows outside  
As the room gets darker  
  
How I wish we could  
Stay like this  
While the rest of the world turns  
  
There has never been a time  
When I didn't want to be your boyfriend  
There has never been a time  
When I didn't want to know your name  
  
Free falling from a work in progress  
Free falling from a life on hold  
There has never been a time  
When I didn't want you  
  
[Chorus]  
My good lover  
Is my one good thing these days  
You help me keep it all  
From slipping away  
I swear I'm gonna marry you someday  
(Someday)  
  
I am all alone  
And it seems like  
All I do is wait  
Yes, we spend hours on the phone  
But it's never the same  
  
No, nothing good ever does easy  
Nothing good ever comes without a fight  
  
I am all alone  
And I wish I was home  
With you tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, my girlfriend is like  
Magic in the hand  
When I lose my sparkle  
She's the only one  
That understands  
  
I know I'm going to marry you someday [Repeat x2]  
Yeah, I swear I'm going to marry you someday  
Yeah yeah, I swear I'm going to marry you  
Someday [Repeat x3]

You know I love you baby  
And I know you love me too  
But the fun that day  
Didn't start until  
We left on our honeymoon  
  
We stepped off the plane  
Into a warm sunny day  
And then we, got laid  
Together  
  
The sun shines down  
On a Hana lei town  
Where the fish all smile  
Cause they know us  
  
Our wedding day  
Was warm and sunny  
Our friends and family  
Came from out of town  
  
We said I do  
Then ate some food  
And smiled  
Until the sun went down  
  
We'll take the Zodiac Cadillac  
Around the north shore  
Then we'll head back  
The sea turtles come to greet us  
  
So let's get loaded tonight  
We'll drink on the flight  
Back home  
The honeymoon is over  
  
You know I love you baby  
And I know you love me too  
But the fun that day  
Didn't start until  
We left on our honeymoon  
  
We're on our honeymoon [Repeat x 2]  
  
The fun that day  
Didn't start until  
We left on our honeymoon

Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call me the gangster of love  
Some people call me maurice  
'cause I speak of the pompitous of love  
  
People keep talking about me, baby  
Said I'm doin' you wrong  
Well, don't worry, don't worry  
'cause I'm right here at home  
  
  
Cause I'm a picker, I'm a grinner  
I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner  
I play my music in the sun  
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker  
I'm a midnight toker  
I sure don't want to hurt no one  
  
You're the cutest thing that I ever did see  
I really love your peaches, want to shake your tree  
Lovey-dovey, lovey-dovey all the time  
Ooo-eee baby, I'll sure show you a good time  
  
Chorus 2x

Right now day one I fall hard when I fall I always fall on you  
Face first head down eyes closed arms out to break my fall we fall  
Down  
  
Like a world of noise we get lost inside the length of our own time  
And the laughing world will never forget that it's when you jam that I  
Jet  
  
I see I want I reach I fail to hold the things that I need  
I turn out reach for you  
  
I want to touch our life before it fades like a burning car in the sun  
We flame for the all in plain view  
And the laughing world will never forget that it's when you jam that I  
Jet  
  
The laughing world will never forget  
The laughing world will never forget

Never said I was innocent  
I will burn in hell for the things I've done to you  
Never said I was anything good  
I should die from the shame from what I put you through  
  
Let me be the one to bring us back from the dead  
I will take the blame for everything  
You know I just want to help you forget  
  
We are still living on broken glass  
We are still numb because it just keeps happening  
All your friends, they can kiss my ass  
They only see the simple things that they want to see  
  
Let me be the one to make the pain go away  
Shave my skin and show a brand new face  
You know I just want to know that you're ok  
  
You don't have to like it but the swing is in my hands now  
Sometimes I think  
The power is better than a hard drug  
Sometimes I think  
The power is better than anything  
Sometimes I think  
Letting go is just like giving up  
Sometimes all I think I want to do is die inside  
All I want to do is die inside  
All I ever think about is you and me falling apart  
  
Never said I was innocent  
I will burn in hell for the things I've done to you  
Never said I was anything good  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah  
  
Let me be the one to make the pain go away  
Shave my skin and show a brand new face  
You know I just want to know that you're ok  
Let me be the one to bring us back from the dead  
I will take the blame for everything  
I just want to help you forget  
  
Sometimes I think  
Letting go is just like giving up  
Sometimes all I think about is falling apart

We have been sleeping with the lights on  
Just about every night  
Because we are afraid of what the dark might bring  
I know, I know it's just a childish fear  
That grows and grows wild in the middle of me  
  
I'm gonna get a new tattoo  
Black and stretching around my arm  
Like a life that is visible and real  
I know, I know it's stupid and immature  
I just want to give shape to the face  
That twists inside both you and me  
  
Breathing fire, doesn't look good on a resume  
Neither does anything else we do  
We got to get ready for the real world  
Yeah yeah we got to grow up  
  
You know I like to die for awhile  
Everyday in the afternoon  
I like to let the arms of a bar  
Wrap around me tight  
I'm just going to sprawl in the front booth  
Big drink above my head  
Cross eyed and smiling as I watch the world  
Go twisting by  
  
I don't want to die with you  
Or live in the same dark room  
I don't want to see your bloodshot eyes no more, no more  
I just want to take this girl, all curls and big brown eyes  
Man I can't take the pain of wanting her, needing her  
  
I know the secret of your soul  
And I just don't want to know  
Yeah, man we got to grow up

I walk around in the market  
Late at night  
I walk around in the empty aisles  
And I don't know why  
I need to be  
Close to the light  
So I walk around  
In the middle of the night  
  
I drive around in the neighborhood  
I want to lose my house  
Drive around on the freeway  
Guess I want to lose myself  
Turn the key  
Turn the dial  
Listen to the radio  
And just drive for a while  
  
Yeah, I got no place to go  
I wish I  
Could come home  
To a life that looks like a TV show  
Wish I  
Could see  
My television family waiting for me  
  
Where no one fights  
No one screams  
No one lies  
And no one leaves  
I don't care how the story ends  
I want to feel like I'm living again  
  
I drive away from the city  
Need to see the sky  
Drive away from the bad things  
That make me close my eyes  
Leave it all  
In the past  
Drive away  
Going nowhere fast  
  
Yeah, now I got nowhere to go  
I wish I  
Could go home  
To a life that looks like a TV show  
Wish I  
Could see  
My television family waiting for me  
  
Where no one fights  
And no one screams  
No one lies  
And no one leaves  
I don't care how the story ends  
I want to feel like I used to feel  
I want to feel like I'm living again  
  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
Breathing out  
And breathing in  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
  
Walk away from the circles  
Need to find myself  
I think I need to start over  
Need to start making sense  
  
Breathe out  
Breathe in  
I wish I could start all over again  
  
I wish I could do it all over again  
  
I wish I  
Could come home  
To a life like the one that I used to know  
I wish I  
Could someday see  
Everything back the way it used to be  
  
Where no one cries  
No one screams  
No one hits you  
And no one leaves  
Everybody loves how the story ends  
All the bad guys lose  
And the good guys win  
  
I wish I could do it all over again  
  
I want to feel someday  
I can really start living again  
  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
  
Whoa  
I am living again  
  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
Whoa  
I'm living again  
  
Whoa  
Yes, I'm living again

Paint the stars in the sky  
On the ceiling above our bed  
Roll through the night with your blood  
Beating hard like a drum inside my head  
Paint the stars in the sky  
That were shining on the night we met  
If we can do this then we can do anything  
Throw the clothes in a pile in the corner on the dirty wood floor  
Open up the big windows and throw a chain on the double locked door  
Open up to the flame  
So strong, it feels so good even though we know that it's wrong  
When we make love I feel complete, like I can do anything  
We can lose ourselves to the far away sound of the noise of the boulevard  
We can lose ourselves tonight underneath the western stars  
The wind sounds just like the ocean  
Blowing big through the trees in my backyard  
I sit alone in a dark room smoking  
And wondering where you are  
You went away when the truth came down  
The sex was not enough for you to make you want to stick around  
You said that I made you feel weak  
I made you feel like you couldn't do anything  
I try to sing myself to sleep to the rythym of the sound of the boulevard cars  
I lay awake with my eyes wide open underneath the western stars  
Hard promises broken that should have never been made  
You were cold in your anger  
I was warm in the shame  
I don't have any illusions of the good old days  
If we make it through this then I know that  
We can do anything  
We can do anything  
I'm going to walk all the steps and find a place where I can lie  
Lay on my back in the grass and stare at the stars in the warm night sky  
I'm going to find me a new blonde girl, hungry for the things that don't come
easy in the real world  
She will let me be myself  
I know she will let me do anything  
We can lose ourselves making love all night on a blanket in the neighborhood
park  
We can lose ourselves making love all night underneath the western stars  
We can lose ourselves tonight underneath the western stars  
Hard promises broken should have never been made  
You were cold in your anger  
I was warm in the shame  
I don't have any illusions of the good old days  
If I can make it through this then I know that I can do anything  
I can do anything  

This is gonna sound  
A little obsessive  
A little bit strange  
I have one thing to say  
Before I turn and I walk away  
This is gonna sound  
A little impulsive  
This is gonna sound  
A little insane  
I know you don't know me yet  
But you and I  
We will be together  
Someday  
Someday  
  
I know, I know, I sound  
Like I'm on drugs  
But listen to me now  
When I say  
  
That ever since when I first saw you  
Sitting on your car outside  
You asked for a cigarette  
I couldn't stop staring  
At your eyes  
  
Ever since when I first saw you  
Looking bored in that plastic chair  
With the lights of the office  
Around you  
Those blond streaks  
They look so pretty  
In your black hair  
  
You look cool and alternative  
With that disaffected stare  
You want people to think  
That you just don't care  
  
Hey you can be with me  
'cause I just might be the one  
Who will treat you like you're perfect  
Who will always make you come  
  
You can be with me  
I will always let you win  
I will never be like those other guys  
I will never be your  
Unemployed boyfriend  
  
This is gonna sound  
A little bit out there  
This is gonna sound  
A little insane  
But I keep having the same dream  
That you will  
Be the mother of my children  
Someday  
  
Someday  
  
I heard you sleep with that  
Obnoxious guy  
I know he is in that famous band  
You look so sad when you  
Are with him  
I never see him reach  
To hold your hand  
  
You can be with me  
Yes I will treat you like a queen  
I will go to all those  
Chick flick movies  
That I really don't want to see  
  
You can be with me  
No I will never let you down  
I will never make out  
With your girlfriend  
When I know you're not around  
  
You can be with me  
Yeah I just might be the one  
Who will treat you like you're special  
I will always make you come  
  
You can be with me  
I will always let you win  
I will never be like those other guys  
I will never be like those other guys!  
I will never be your  
Unemployed boyfriend

I like it here in this quiet room  
We can turn off all the trouble when we do what we do.  
I like it here in the middle of the day,  
We can hide inside each other when we need to get away  
From rest of world  
We need to get away from the world outside.  
Way from the world,  
Need to find the place where we can hide  
Somewhere they can't find us  
Yeah, somewhere under a volcano.  
We can hide inside a volcano  
We can find the good life on the inside.  
  
I like the crazy way you look at me,  
Without the drugs we can be what we're afraid to be.  
I remember what it's like to be clean and insane  
I remember what is that makes me need to get away.  
Away from of world  
We need to get away from the world outside.  
Away from the world,  
We need to find a place where we can hide, yeah  
Somewhere they can't find us  
Where my chain can pass from black to white  
They may let us out this time, oh.  
I made some mistakes, I paid the price  
I walked away clean, you know I did my time.  
You've been waiting for years, waiting for me.  
Waiting to leave so we can find a dream  
We can live under volcano with the fire all around  
We can lose yourself inside a dream  
In the middle of the northern sound.  
Get away from the world  
We need to get away from the world  
Gotta get away from the world.  
We got to get away, oh oh  
Get away from the world  
We got to get away, oh oh  
Away from the world  
You know we gotta find the place where we can hide  
Oh, somewhere we can hide.  
We can find the good life on the inside.

I close my eyes when I get too sad  
I think thoughts that I know are bad  
Close my eyes and I count to ten  
Hope it's over when I open them  
  
I want the things that I had before  
Like a Star Wars poster on my bedroom door  
I wish I could count to ten  
Make everything be wonderful again  
  
Hope my mom and I hope my dad  
Will figure out why they get so mad  
Hear them scream, I hear them fight  
Say bad words that make me want to cry  
  
Close my eyes when I go to bed  
And I dream of angels that make me smile  
I feel better when I hear them say  
Everything will be wonderful someday  
  
Promises mean everything when you're little  
And the world's so big  
I just don't understand how  
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes  
Tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
(Na na na na na na na)  
  
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I go to school and I run and play  
I tell the kids that it's all okay  
I like to laugh so my friends won't know  
When the bell rings I just don't want to go home  
  
Go to my room and I close my eyes  
I make believe that I have a new life  
I don't believe you when you say  
Everything will be wonderful someday  
  
Promises mean everything when you're little  
And the world is so big  
I just don't understand how  
You can smile with all those tears in your eyes  
When you tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I don't want to hear you say  
That I will understand someday  
No, no, no, no  
I don't want to hear you say  
We both have grown in a different way  
No, no, no, no  
I don't want to meet your friends  
And I don't want to start over again  
I just want to my life to be the same  
Just like it used to be  
Some days I hate everything  
I hate everything  
Everyone and everything  
Please don't tell me everything is wonderful now  
  
I don't want to hear you tell me everything is wonderful now
