Written by Kirk Franklin  
  
This is to my friend above  
Who shows me so much love and grace  
By placing a smile upon my face  
It's so hard to express the way I feel  
About a man who can heal your life  
By dying on a cross  
For sinners who were lost  
Lord, I love you so much  
That I'm yearning for Your touch  
  
This is to my friend above  
Who shows me so much love and grace  
By placing a smile upon my face  
It's so hard to express the way I feel  
About a man who can heal your life  
By dying on a cross  
For sinners who were lost  
And while I'm here today  
There's just one thing that I want to say  
  
Chorus  
Watch over me and protect me  
From the things I cannot see  
Let Your loving arms surround me  
From here to eternity  
Lord I need Your anointing  
So my spirit can be free  
Lord I need You more,  
And more and more, and more  
  
Repeat  
  
I need You more and more  
I need You more and more  
Repeat 2x's

[Chorus]  
After a while, after a while  
This too shall pass  
After a while  
Scars will heal, you'll love again  
It won't hurt you after a while  
It won't hurt after a while  
  
Stuck between if and when  
You pray and tried  
But still no end  
God's purpose soon you'll understand  
It won't hurt you after a while  
It won't hurt you after a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So when the pain has come to an end  
And now your heart is whole again  
Help someone who needs to know  
That it won't hurt them after a while  
It won't hurt them after a while  
It won't hurt them after a while

You are all I need  
I will sing lift up my voice and I will rejoice forever.  
I will bring all that I am to all that you are forever.  
  
You are all I need  
I will sing lift up my voice and I will rejoice forever.  
I will bring all that I am to all that you are forever.  
  
You are all I need  
I will sing lift up my voice and I will rejoice forever.  
I will bring all that I am to all that you are forever.  
You are the one for me you are all I need.

Finally I see what's right in front of me, the chance to be free  
From all the troubles that this life could bring if only we would sing...  
I've been living for tomorrow so long I can't recall the feeling I had when I
was with you  
  
Living every single day as if it's my last day.  
I missed the reason why I'm here.  
Everything is meaningless except a life that is confident in you.  
That you would walk beside me in all the things I see and in all I do.  
It's because of you.  
  
No more living for tomorrow.  
Today's the day that I will be the one to change the world.  
Living every single day as if it's my last day.  
I know the reason I am here.  
  
Finally I see what's right in front of me, the chance to be free  
From all the troubles that this life could bring if only we could sing...  
No more living for tomorrow.  
Today's the day that I will be the one to change the world.  
  
Living every single day as if it's my last day.  
I know the reason I am here.  
No more living for tomorrow.  
Today's the day that I will be the one to change the world.  
  
Living every single day as if it's my last day.  
I know the reason for today. I'm living for today.

You know I've had some lonely days.  
I've made mistakes and had to pay.  
I've had some friends that walked away  
Just like momma told me.  
But there's someone whose love is real.  
Who cares about the way feel.  
Every pain and erased every stain.  
There's peace when I call out your name.  
  
Jesus your my everything, the cross you did that just for me.  
So whatever you take me through, I promise you, I'll spend my always with you.  
No one can touch my heart like you, or make me smile the way you dooo,  
I finally found someone who, who really truly loves me.  
  
And when my strength has come and gone, your life in me it makes me strong.  
Your hand is where my heart belongs.  
You took all my pain and erase every stain.  
  
[Chorus]  
Jesus your my everything, the cross you did that just for me.  
So whatever you take me through, I promise you, I'll spend my always with you.  
Jesus my whole life has changed, since that day I cried Your name.  
  
For every time You brought me through,  
I promise You, I'll spend my always with You.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I was hungry you feed me  
Naked you clothed me  
They will know us by our love  
  
Can't imagine how it felt as layed there  
Through the dark through the heat through the cold  
With your friend by your side held his hand and watched him die  
And you cried as you prayed for his soul  
  
I can't imagine how it felt as you stood there  
Through the winds that would just not go away (um huh)  
  
Kiss my wife tell my son my work on earth is done  
You're the one that can still hear them say (ooh)  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
And does anybody know my name  
No my friend we were not there  
But we're here and we care  
And yes we feel your pain (ooh yes)  
And yes we feel your pain  
  
I can't imagine how you felt as you sat there  
Trying to hide the fear upond your face  
  
As the earth begins to cry and you ask the preacher why  
Tonight we can hear the children say (hear them say)  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
And does anybody know my name (anybody)  
No my friend we were not there  
But we're here and we care  
And yes we feel your pain (ooh)  
  
And does anybody out there know me (Do you know me)  
Can you stop the clock make this go away(make it do away)  
No the cross we can not bare but god can and he cares  
And yes he feels your pain (we can feel the pain)  
And yes he feels your pain  
  
And can anybody see because my faith is getting weak  
Don't know how much more I can take  
Hear my heart and please don't delay (lay)  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
And does anybody my name  
No my friend we were not there  
But we're here and we care(oh oh)  
And yes we feel your pain (Yeah)  
  
Is there anybody out there listening  
(Does anybody know) does anybody my name  
(Does anyone know my name)  
No my friend we were not there  
And I look right hear and I care (we hear and we care)  
And yes (yes)he feels your pain (I feel your pain) (yeaaaah)  
  
Does anybody out there know me(know me)  
Please stop the clock and make this go way (you can make it go away)  
  
No that cross I can not bare but he can and he cares  
And (yes) feels your pain (oh yes)  
And yes he feels your pain  
And yes he feels your pain(feels your pain)(thank you jesus)  
  
The clock is ticking we hear you (oh my oh my) we see you  
He's got the whole world in his hands (oh ohh)  
He's got the whole world in his hands (you and me sister you and me brother)  
Hands (hands) hands

If I could I, I'd get away  
Far from all this trouble I see everyday  
Nobody wants to show their face  
This life is like a, like a masquerade  
I know you love me  
I know you care  
But while I'm hurting I just need to know your there  
Watching over me and I feel your telling me  
  
[Chorus]  
Count it all joy and always remember,  
Life will get better it's gonna get better  
No matter the weapon it will not prosper,  
Things will get better it's gonna get better  
  
Persecuted, pushed away, didn't think I'd live to see another day  
Cried some tears and couldn't pray and when I'd try at times  
I couldn't find the words to say, but now  
I'm stronger, because of you without you Jesus I never could've made it
through  
Thank you for watching me loving me and telling me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Life sometimes may change and nobody wants to feel pain,  
But it came to help you grow and there's one thing you need to know  
God's in love with you and he'll never let you go  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better  
It's gonna get better

Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
Oh ah, oh ah, oh ah  
  
[Verse 1:]  
When I cannot hear the sparrow sing  
And I cannot feel the melody  
There's a secret place that's full of grace  
There's a blessing in the storm,  
Help me sing it  
There's a blessing in the storm.  
  
[Verse 2:]  
When the sickness won't leave my body  
And the pain just won't leave my soul  
I get on my knees and say "Jesus please"  
There's a blessing in the storm,  
Help me sing it  
There's a blessing in the storm.  
  
[Verse 3:]  
When I cannot seem to love again  
And the raindrops won't ever end  
If you just hold on  
Those clouds will soon be gone  
There's a blessing in the storm  
Help me sing it  
There's a blessing in the storm.  
Sweet sweet, the storm, sweet  
(repeat verse 3)

Chorus  
Jesus Your love  
Takes my breath away  
I can't get You off my mind  
I think about You night and day  
When the tears fell from my eyes  
You caught 'em in the nick of time  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Verse 1  
Jesus Your love  
Takes my breath away  
It feels like sunshine  
When I have a cloudy day  
It's a feeling that I can't explain  
All I have to do is just call Your name  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
Jesus Your love  
Is like a sweet melody (swee-de-de-de-deeeee)  
I get joy when I think about all the You've done for me  
No other love can compare  
When I needed You  
You were there  
Oh Jesus Your love  
Takes my  
Breath away  
  
Chorus  
  
I can't breathe (can't breathe)  
I can't sing (can't sing)  
I can't live (can't live)  
No no (no no)

I can't talk (can't talk)  
Without Your love (without Your love) Without Your love  
I can't walk (can't walk)  
I can't talk (can't talk)  
Without Your love (without Your love)  
  
Chorus

When I close my eyes and think of you  
And reminisce on all the things you do  
I can't imagine my life without you  
It's like paradise now I know that it's real (um)  
It's a mystery for someone to give their life just for me  
What you did on calvary  
Makes me wann love you more  
  
[Chorus]  
I never knew I could be so happy  
And I never knew I'd be so secure because of your love  
Life has brand new meaning  
It's gonna be a brighter day, brighter day  
  
Never thought that I would smile again  
I never thought the dark clouds would end  
Never thought the dark clouds would end  
Never thought that I could have a friend  
That would keep me never leave me alone (um)  
Jesus you're my everything  
The only one that makes my heart sing (heart sing)  
Now I know what real love means  
It's everlasting, lasting.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nothing can compare to the joy ya bring an ever lasting love affair  
Jesus my life will never will be same I found someone who truly cares  
  
[Chorus]

For my transgressions (ohh ohh ohh).  
And by his stripes we are healed.

Don't take your joy away  
Don't take your joy away  
I know that I have done wrong  
But I'm asking You as I sing this song  
Don't take your joy away  
  
Don't take it  
I can't make it  
I've tried it  
I can't live without it  
  
Restore unto me the joy of my salvation  
Make me Jesus a new creation  
Shake me and make me  
Hold me and mold me  
Choose me and use me  
Chastise me  
Revive me

Have you ever been so down down  
That you don't really know what to say  
You tried and tried to do what's right right  
And it seems more stuff comes your way  
So you unplug all the phones, jus want to be left alone  
Praying for a better day.  
  
[Chorus]  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.  
  
See people always talk about bout  
The things that they've been going through  
But you can't tell how me I feel feel  
Until you walk in my shoes  
See I'm tired of being tired  
Fake people all around  
Want someone to love me for me (me)  
  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Don't worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.  
  
[Bridge]  
When the rainbow can not be found  
And so called best friend, you're not around  
I open my eyes and realize  
You were always there  
  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Then I hear you sweet voice (Dont worry)  
Will you be there (In a hurry)  
You know I've been hurt before (I see you)  
Don't want to be hurt no more no no (Never leave you no)  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry.

Kirk Franklin:  
For those of you that are going through  
I want you to wipe every tear from you eye  
Cause Jesus said he'll meet us someday  
Down by the riverside  
Can I get A witness up in here  
  
Choir:  
It's Friday and my bills are due  
My 3 month old baby need some shoes  
Can't you feel what I'm going through  
Clock on the wall keeps ticking tocking  
No stopping and somebody's knocking  
On my door telling me to go  
Brother I can't take no more  
So wit my knees I hit the floor  
And say help me Jesus, help me Jesus  
  
Chorus:  
Let's go down by the riverside  
Leave your problems all behind  
You can rest troubled minds  
Down by....  
The riverside  
  
Kirk Franklin:  
I don't think you heard me the first  
So then why don't I say it one more time  
Everybody Jesus is going to meet us down there  
By the riverside  
One time for the holy mind  
  
Choir:  
If I concentrate on all the bad  
And all the things I wish I had  
How can those dark clouds ever pass  
Weeping, enduring for night  
But joy comes in the morning light  
Gotta keep the spirit right  
So no matter what the people say  
Ain't nobody taking this joy away  
In spite of everything I been through  
I can say...  
Thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus, thank you Jesus  
  
Chorus(2X):  
Let's go down by the riverside  
Leave your problems all behind  
You can rest troubled minds  
Down by....  
  
Kirk franklin:

As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the starry crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O sisters let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
O sisters let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the robe and crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O brothers let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
Come on brothers let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the starry crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O fathers let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
O fathers let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the robe and crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O mothers let's go down,  
Let's go down, don't 'cha wanna go down,  
Come on mothers let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the starry crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!  
  
O sinners let's go down,  
Let's go down, come on down,  
O sinners let's go down,  
Down in the river to pray.  
  
(next verse just a whisper like a whispering pray)  
  
As I went down in the river to pray  
Studying about that good old way  
And who shall wear the robe and crown  
Good Lord, show me the way!

Everyone hurts and goes through pain  
Whatever's first, it feels the same  
Be young or poor, old age or fame

So we pray tonight, that you don't get weak  
And please pray that I, don't forget what I believe  
'Cause these days are hard, and faith sometimes is work  
Pray until He heals the hurt  
I trust God will heal the hurt

I know they hurt you  
They saw you stumble but didn't help you  
And now they left you  
They were quick to pray but slow to move  
  
And now you're empty  
Too tired to run, you walk away  
In the night there's a voice  
If you listen He sweetly says  
  
Come back to your first love (first love, first love)  
Come back home, back where you belong  
Come (to your, to your) first love  
  
You didn't make it  
You thought your love would last forever  
Ain't it funny how a chapter can make a story change  
Cold and lonely, you never knew hurt could feel this way  
Understand there's a plan if you're patient  
Hear the savior say  
  
God is able to heal if you listen  
And He'll show you His will if you listen  
But you gotta be still and just listen, listen  
  
Come back to your first love, first love  
Come back to your first love, first love  
Come back to your first love, first love  
Come back to your first love, first love  
  
Home, home, home, I'm Home  
Home, home, home, I'm Home

I know the pain you feel inside  
And the tears you try to hide  
In your heart you ask God why  
Can you help me, will you help me please  
Take away the pain  
Where's the sun I feel the rain.  
Then I hear your spirit say... That I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
Free  
Free to lift my hands  
Free to say Amen  
Free to know that someday I will smile again  
I'm free  
Free to laugh not cry  
Free to live not die  
Because of your love  
I'm free  
  
I know you're troubled by your past  
And you hide behind your mask  
The misery it seems to last  
Through the night but it's alright  
Joy is just a prayer away  
Don't look back at yesterday  
Then hear your spirit say  
That I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
Free  
Free to lift my hands  
Free to say Amen  
Free to know that someday I will smile again  
I'm free  
Free to laugh not cry  
Free to live not die  
Because of your love  
I'm Free  
  
No more chains and loneliness  
For Christ has set me free  
For we are more than conquerors  
Through his love now I can see  
That I am  
  
[Chorus:]  
Free  
Free to lift my hands  
Free to say Amen  
Free to know that someday I will smile again  
I'm free  
Free to laugh not cry  
Free to live not die  
Because of your love  
I'm Free

When I wake up in the morning love  
And my heart is filled with pain  
The smile I had upon my face is gone  
Can't see the sunshine from the rain  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
Jesus you're the lover of my soul  
The fire that burns deep within  
You are the joy this world can't take away  
The spirit tells me this will never end  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
I know you going through some stuf now  
Feeling ruff now, feel like givin' up now  
But how can you learn if you don't fall  
But how can you walk if first you don't crawl  
But through it all you keep blessing me  
While people keep on pressin' me and stressin' me  
Because they never hear a preacher flow  
Let's come together with one heart, one mind  
Until we see the sunshine  
When I think of you then the world is alright with me  
Lord just one thought of you and I know it's gonna be  
A lovely day lovely day  
  
A lovely day yeah

Written by Kirk Franklin  
CHORUS  
It really doesn't matter  
What you're going through  
I know that Jesus can work it out for you  
His yoke is easy, and His burden light  
Just give it to Jesus  
He'll make it alright  
He can handle it  
He can handle it  
Repeat  
He can handle it  
There's no doubt about my savior  
I know He will deliver  
He can handle it  
There's no doubt about my savior  
I know He will deliver  
Whatever it is  
He can handle it  
Repeat  
He can (4x's)  
Repeat  
He can  
Handle it

If you know He can say yes  
Yes!  
Repeat 2x's  
  

He loves me. Even when I fall beneath His will.  
He loves me, oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
When my broken heart just won't keeps still.  
He loves me oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
Even though He knew sometimes I'd fall.  
Yet and still my name He called. He loves me.  
Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love.  
He loves me. Even though I was born in sin.  
He loves me, oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
Took me like I was and now I'm free again  
He loves me, oh, oh, oh, He loves me.  
Even though He knew that Keisha would fall.  
Yet and still my name He knows. He loves me.  
Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love.  
He loves me. Fall beneath Your will. But He loves me.  
You yet and still loves me. This old broken heart just  
won't keep still. Jesus I'm so grateful for Your love.  
Jesus loves the little children.  
When nothing else could help, love lifted me.

"I just want to write you a letter. I have to be very honest with you right
now.  
I don't really know how to say this... "  
  
I wanna believe  
But I'm having a hard time seeing past what I see right now, I see right now  
I wanna be free  
But when I try to fly I realize I don't know how, no one showed me how  
Wish I could see that this mess I'm in will really work out for my good, you
said it would  
So, if you can hear me, can you give me a sign cause I don't feel you like I
should, please if you Could  
My faith is almost gone, I can't hold on much longer, take this cup from me  
  
[Chorus]  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
(I want you to know)  
I wanna believe  
If I never hear I'm sorry I can let it go, gotta let you go  
Cause, it's killing me. Jesus you know how it feels cause you've been hurt
before, don't wanna hurt No more  
I'm trying to hear you speak, but my heart is growing weaker, take this cup
from me  
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I've been here before and can't take that hurt again  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
Believe  
Believe  
  
I wanna believe when I close my eyes on this side I'll wake up with you, more
in love with you  
And, and finally, you will say my race it is over and my work is through,
cause I believed in you  
I know dark nights will come and some days there'll be no sunshine and you're
too far to see  
  
Help me believe  
Can I believe  
Let me believe  
I wanna believe  
I'm no good on my own, please give me another chance  
It's hard to believe in what I can't see  
To give you my will cause you're what's better for  
You can look in my eyes and see I wanna believe, believe, believe, believe

The heavens were silent  
The earth weeped in pain  
Nations were trembling and hope never came  
A Terror filled the air  
And it wouldn't go away  
We needed a hero to come and save  
  
Famine and hunger,  
Disease in the land  
The hatred the killing taking lives from your hand  
Creation waits through the darkness we pray  
Tell me where is the hero to come and save  
  
Through the nails  
Through the thorns  
From the hill to the grave  
Was a voice in the distance the lamb that was slain  
My soul had no song and my debt I couldn't pay  
When I needed a hero you came and you saved  
  
To the homeless  
The widow  
The fatherless son  
To the sick and the broken alone with no one  
Lift up you head your hope is on the way  
When we needed a hero you came and you saved the day  
  
When the curtain had closed  
And it felt like the end  
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin  
Even though men deny  
You're the only sacrifice  
That loved us enough you loved us so much Lord  
That you gave your life see you saved my life  
  
Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed  
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged  
Every wrong is erased, Jesus  
You are my hero you came and you saved the day  
  
When the curtain had closed  
And it felt like the end  
When your blood caught the fall and took away every sin  
Even though men deny  
You're the only sacrifice  
That loved us enough you love us so much Lord  
That you gave your life see you saved my life  
  
Now I can see you I'm no longer ashamed  
Your power I feel see our lives have exchanged  
Every wrong is erased, Jesus  
You are my hero you came and you saved  
You are my hero you came and you saved  
You are my hero you came and saved the day  
  
You saved you saved the day  
You saved you saved the day  
  
You are my hero you came and you saved the day

[Verse 1:]  
I know you see us  
I know you hear us  
And you fill us when we pray  
You understand us, see deep inside us  
Translate tears and take them away  
I'm a be honest, there are times  
Your ways and method's, I don't understand  
It seems so far, tell me who you are  
I know your touch, but can't see your plan  
I'm lost in this thing called life,  
Left to me now feels right  
It's your turn now, I wanna be where you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hide me  
Let me live behind you  
Cause I need  
Shelter from the rain  
Remind me  
The only way my faith can grow  
Is when you let your winds blow  
You're making me stronger now, so rain,  
Don't go away  
Don't go away  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'd admit  
It'd be nice  
To have some light shine down on me  
Especially,  
When, lord I shall be, you don't always let me see  
It ain't easy,  
But I'm trying hard to get out of your way  
To believe  
That what you say  
That my change begins today  
The road includes some pain,  
And to grow you need some rain  
And when it falls, I wanna be where you are  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Cause there's some much I see  
Needs to grow inside of me  
In the fire I realize  
Before I live, I have to die  
Please believe me when I say  
I can't waste another day  
It's so easy to complain  
But complain don't make a change  
Not the victim anymore  
All the things god has in store  
If I ain't ready don't let the rain  
Go away  
Don't go away  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hide me  
Cause I need  
Remind me  
The only way my faith can grow  
Is when you let your winds blow  
You're making me stronger now  
  
You're making me stronger now [x7]  
You made me stronger now [x4]  
  
[x2]  
He made me stronger now  
She made me stronger now  
They made me stronger now [x2]  
  
You made me stronger now [x8]

I ain't gonna lie  
I can't even count the days  
Or the many nights I tried living here alone  
A heart full of pride  
Couldn't see the enemy was me  
I was blind and thought my second chance was gone  
A ship without a sail  
Battered by the raging sea  
Taking any love I can to try and stop the rain  
While waiting to exhale I finally got on my knees  
I know it's been a long time  
Do you still remember my name?  
  
Can I go back in time?  
Can I have another try?  
But I can't change yesterday  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I  
Can't take another day without you  
Cause this heart don't beat the same without you  
I forgot who I was  
Got caught up in this world  
Jesus I apologize  
I should've lost my mind without you  
Not another sleepless night without you Jesus  
I'm sorry and I'm asking please  
Make us how we used to be  
  
I try and try to keep my mind on you  
But trouble keeps calling me  
Every time a wound heals  
Something else takes the healing away  
But even when I've gone too far  
You don't even call my name  
Mama said if you love let it go  
And if it comes back then it's back to stay  
You already knew I belong to only you  
I run to your arms and say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never knew a life so cold  
Thought that things could fulfill my soul  
Tried to find love on my own  
It was hard to admit I was wrong  
No money, no cars, no fame, no lies, no games my life is taken  
  
Now we've come to the break  
Tell me what you gone say (you gone say)  
I know (I know)  
I give my life right  
But you know  
You ain't promised tonight  
Babygirl  
Without you  
(I can't breathe)  
Without you  
(I can't exist)  
Without you  
(This world ain't got nothing for me  
I'm coming home)  
  
[Chorus 2x]

[Kirk Franklin:] Toby Mac! (huh!) Turn it up!  
[Toby Mac:] Kirk, gonna get his white boy on!  
[Kirk Franklin:] God, I know You up to something (uhhh!) I can see it all
right now (woo!) You pulling back my covers it's getting crazy (Come on!)  
  
[Verse 1: Kirk Franklin]  
Think I'm gonna walk away  
You're messing up my life today (wassup)  
This time I refuse to pray  
Still you keep calling me (calling me)  
I don't wanna see your face  
The thing I love you erased (Come on!)  
Nothing but an empty space  
Now I don't know how to be  
I know it wasn't right for me(Yea!)  
What you liking what you need  
I feel like I'm in surgery  
Still you cut deeper  
  
My secrets within  
My blanket of sin  
Lord how much longer 'till ya through with me  
Please take what you need (can I get up now!)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Be still and know I am God  
Be still and know I am God  
  
[Verse 2: Toby Mac]  
Loving you Lord is my way  
Everything you don't explain  
Somethings I don't want to change  
So you keep breaking me (there you go!)  
It's like I'm fighting for my life (woo!)  
You hit me with another light  
I feel like Jacob in the night  
Won't stop 'till you bless me  
  
My flesh and my will (yes father!)  
Is yours not to kill (to kill!)  
Bringing myself to you (come on!)  
But living sacrifice is more (can I get up now)  
  
[Chorus:]  
Be still and know I am God (gotta know gotta know gotta know gotta know)  
Be still and know (yea) I am God(gotta know gotta know one more time!)  
Be still and know I am God (you are god! you are god! gotta know! gotta know!)  
Be still (Be still) and know (and know) I am God (yea!)  
  
[Bridge:]  
If I could I'd fly away from here  
But even when I'm far you still are near  
I gotta get out (There's no way out)  
Where is there to run(There's no where to run)  
Don't go(Don't go)  
Don't go (Can't go)  
No! No! No! (Whoa!)  
  
[Kirk Franklin:]  
You win. (uh huh!)  
I've been trying to do it on my own. (Yes Lord!)  
But right now I gotta surrender  
You know what's best (Say it like you mean it!)  
It's not easy waiting on you  
It's not easy believing that you got this together  
But without faith it is impossible to please you (We recognize you!)  
So I'm gonna stand right here. (We are still before you!)  
You got me. (We are still before you!) You got me You got me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Be still and know (we know!) I am God (We gonna lift those hands I surrender
to your authority God! I surrender!)  
Be still (we're still!) and know (we know!) I am God (I give you my

[Chorus]  
I like me,  
Yo, you like?  
Cause I like me  
Do you like me?  
See I like me  
Cause he like me  
God likes me  
You, you don't like me?  
You, you don't like me?  
  
Short, big nose, big lips  
Kinda st- st- stutter but, I never trip  
Got my daddy's swagger and I walk with a limp  
Got a hot wife, no need to be a pimp  
Never been cute, never been fly  
Since I been changed got that twinkle in my eye  
Got my grill fixed, now I smile when I speak  
Tell me who that is, that's the Jesus freak, it's ya boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just smile, I'm so content  
And I ain't even got yellow stones on my wrist  
I hear the world I'm supposed to be rich  
Bud I don't but that, man, I don't go with the trends  
Go the whole mile, lose or win  
I hope that's the impression that the Cd's give  
I'm more concerned about how they see me live  
Than trying to get a house on MTV cribs  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When the light fade, I know that you see  
More than my swagger, But it's you in me  
From the storefront church to the packed out floors  
They want an autograph but I'd rather give 'em yours  
Ya ink don't fade, the crowd wants more  
The king's on stage, the final encore  
Can't believe it's, me now I'm chillin' backstage  
Big nose, big lips, gon' get ya hands raised  
  
I like me,  
Yo, you like?  
Cause I like me  
Do you like me?  
See I like me  
Cause he like me  
God likes me

I dedicate this song to recession,  
Depression and unemployment  
This song's for you  
  
Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine  
Nothing but clouds, and it's dark in my heart  
And it feels like a cold night  
Today's a new day, where are my blue skies  
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me  
Tell me it's alright  
  
(I'll be honest with you)  
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain  
Fell from heaven like a shower  
  
(When I think how much better I'm gonna be when this is over)  
I smile, even though I hurt see I smile  
I know God is working so I smile  
Even though I've been here for a while  
I smile, smile  
It's so hard to look up when you been down  
Sure would hate to see you give up now  
You look so much better when you smile, so smile  
  
Today's a new day, but there is no sunshine  
Nothing but clouds and it's dark in my heart  
And it feels like a cold night  
Today's a new day, tell me where are my blue skies  
Where is the love and the joy that you promised me  
Tell me it's alright  
  
(The truth is)  
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain  
Fell from heaven like a shower now

I smile, smile  
It's so hard to look up when you been down  
Sure would hate to see you give up now  
You look so much better when you smile  
  
Smile for me

Smile for me

Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you

Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
(And while your praying)  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
(Look in the mirror)  
Oh oh oh you look so much better when you  
(Always remember)  
You look so much better when you smile, come on  
  
I almost gave up, but a power that I can't explain  
Fell from heaven like a shower now  
  
I smile, even though I hurt see I smile  
I know God is working so I smile  
Even though I've been here for a while  
I smile, smile  
It's so hard to look up when you been down

Imagine me  
Loving what I see when the mirror looks at me 'cause I...  
I imagine me  
In a place of no insecurities  
And I'm finally happy 'cause  
I imagine me  
  
Letting go of all of the ones who hurt me  
'Cause they never did deserve me  
Can you imagine me?  
Saying no to thoughts that try to control me  
Remembering all you told me  
Lord, can you imagine me?  
Over what my mama said  
And healed from what my daddy did  
And I wanna live and not read that page again  
  
[Chorus]  
Imagine me, being free, trusting you totally, finally I can  
Imagine me  
I admit it was hard to see  
You being in love with someone like me  
But finally I can  
Imagine me  
  
Being strong  
And not letting people break me down  
You won't get that joy this time around  
Can you imagine me  
In a world (in a world) where nobody has to live afraid?  
Because of your love, fear's gone away  
Can you imagine me?  
  
[Bridge]  
Letting go of my past  
And glad I have another chance  
And my heart will dance  
'Cause I don't have to read that page again  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Gone, gone, it's gone, all gone

I refuse to be another black statistic  
A black man who can wine and dine in the sin of the world and still be
considered a christian  
I plan on being great  
I care not to be less  
I refuse to wear a bar code across my chest  
I refuse to let a black tee or throwback jersey define me  
I refuse to let my children witness divorce  
Or make mature decisions in court  
I refuse to grow up carrying the generational curse  
I refuse to feel the need to curse in my verse  
I hate being automatically looked at when someone asks can anyone rap  
I wanna be a black man that can flip it from urban to corporate measures  
A black man who doesn't gain knowledge from the world for his own pleasures  
A black man who reps Christ to the fullest with no regrets  
My only regret is the stigma that many black statistics in the past have set  
Like going to jail, bragging about bail, leaving our kids, cussing at church,  
Married and you still flirt, no father present at birth  
Animosity within the ministers of our church  
I refuse to let my people be viewed as temporary  
I plan on planting a seed not for the moment but for one that's legendary  
As for statistics  
My father broke the mode  
And I feel its my job for the next generation to continue in it  
Because I refuse to be another black statistic

Try to call your best friend.  
But he's not there, so you wind up feeling empty like no one cares

[Verse 1]  
That touch I felt was you,  
I believe it  
It felt like something you would do  
How you, you keep reminding me  
That you made me for yo, I knew,  
That there would be some days  
That cant be guaranteed to be blue,  
Its true, but then where would I be without opportunities to,  
Watch you change my broken life,  
Hear you tell me its gon' be alright now,  
See your plans come together in ways I cant even explain  
  
[Chorus]  
Together we been through hard times,  
But Jesus I'm still in love with you,  
I've had many loves in my life  
But Jesus you make me feel brand new,  
You know its hard for me to believe  
That you love me no matter what I do  
So how I live, I hope you can see  
That I'm in love with you  
  
[Verse 2]  
The morning sun was you,  
I appreciate it just what I needed to get through  
Cause you knew I had a stressful day gotta get away  
With you Jesus you you make me happy  
If I wrote down all the things you do  
The list would take forever I  
Thought it might be better  
To tell you why I smile is cause you,  
You bring no drama in my life  
It was dark but I can see the light now  
Everything is so beautiful to me  
  
[Chorus]

To warm my life up  
  
[Chorus]  
(You bring the sun out)  
You're the reason that I'm living, I was hurting but I'm happy again  
(You bring the sun out)  
I was hurting but I'm happy again  
(You bring the sun out)  
Lord I wanna thank You 'cause  
(You bring the sun out, to make my love grow, you bring the sun out)  
You were there when I had nothing  
You've been with me from beginning to end  
(You bring the sun out)  
No clouds in the sky, that's the reason why  
(I Love You)  
  
Question number one (What can I do)  
Question number two (What can I say)  
To try to let You know (I appreciate, all of the ways You get me through my
day)  
Never would have thought (I would be here)  
A heart with no scars (a face with no tears)  
How can I thank You (how can I show You)  
(Wish I could get the whole world to know You)  
  
If they only knew (You are the one that gives me the air to breathe)  
And see I can't deny that (You're the reason why my life has a melody)  
And even when I stray (I still feel your grace pulling me close to You)  
So no matter where You are, just know I'm not far (without You what would I
do)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Question number three (where would I be)  
And Lord not only that but (how could You see)  
My days and my nights, the pains of my life  
But now it's alright ('cause You worked it out for me)  
You gave me a chance (when I had no chance)  
When I needed help (You gave me your hand)  
So now they need to see (just what You mean to me and if You ever left me
(where would I be)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I feel the sunlight on my life reminding me that it is alright  
And I see the rainbow and I know my storm is finally passed away  
There is a soft wind that begins to blow back the clouds  
So I can see your perfect plan now I can hurry to my destiny

I was searchin'  
For someone to love me right  
Hear me when I cry  
Keep me late at night  
Jesus came even in my misery  
Wipe the tears from my eyes  
This is what He said  
  
Chorus  
Whatcha' lookin' 4  
I'm the One you're lookin' 4  
What you're searchin' 4  
You don't have to search no further  
Give you peace and joy  
Fill your life with happiness  
Don't you look no more  
'Cause I'm the One you're lookin' 4  
  
L-O-V-E love never meant that much to me  
'Til I saw your face  
I felt amazing grace  
But in the midnight hour  
When I held my pillow tight  
He wiped the tears so I could see  
This is what He said  
  
I never knew love could be so sweet  
The joy You give to me  
Peace and harmony  
I love You so  
More than you'll ever know  
What is this that I found, that  
Never, never lets me down  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
What you want  
I've got it  
What you need, I'm the One you're lookin' 4  
It's yours  
I'm the One you're lookin' 4

For some that don't understand our purpose  
And may not understand our praise  
We as the family in Jesus name  
Would like to tell you the reason why we sing  
Family  
  
Someone asked a question  
Why do we sing  
When we lift our hands to Jesus  
What do we really mean  
Someone made we wonder  
When we sing our song  
At times we may be cryin'  
And nothings even wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
I sing because I'm happy  
I sing because I'm free  
His eyes are the sparrow  
That's the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
For some that don't understand our purpose  
And may not understand our praise  
We as the family in Jesus name  
Would like to tell you the reason why we sing  
Family  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
I give the praises to you  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
And when the song is over  
We've all said Amen  
And your heart just keep on singing  
And the song will never end  
And if somebody ask you was it just a show  
Lift your and a be a witness  
And tell the whole the whole world no  
And when we cross that river  
To study war no more  
We will sing our song to Jesus  
The one whom we adore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
Glory Hallelujah  
I give the praises to you  
Glory Hallelujah  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
Your the reason why I sing  
  
Oh I love you  
I love your name Jesus  
Glory Hallelujah  
For the rest of my life Jesus  
You'll be the reason why I sing

I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles  
Write a melody so sweet, make a tear turn into a smile  
I can see the color of spring I can even feel the weather change  
And soon the leaves fall and winter calls,  
'Cause nothing ever stays the same  
When I think of where I've been, what I've done and all I own  
How I think I know everything, like I made it here on my own  
And like the wind that blows, like a flower that grows  
Still with all I can do  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
I admit that sometimes pride tries to hide my view  
And even this gift that you gave me, I forget it's for You  
And all the many days and many ways Your grace I've abused  
Still you were patient and Your love loved me through  
But the wind still blows and the flower still grows and one thing is still
true.  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
(Without You) life's a wound that won't heal  
Without You, nothing in this world is for real  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
Can't live, can't see Your will for me  
Can't do anything  
Anything  
  
(Without You) life's a song with no end  
Without You, like having a heart that won't mend  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
(Without You) life's a wound that won't heal  
Without You, nothing in this world is for real  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
Without You, we're like a bride with no groom  
Without You, it's like seeing no sunshine in June  
Without You, we're just actors on a stage  
Like a child who's lost his way  
We wouldn't be here today  
Without You, Jesus my life would be lost.  
Without You, I'll never know what it cost  
To see You, lay Your life down for me  
From my past now I'm free  
Tell me where would I be without You.  
Tell me where would I be without You  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
Wouldn't be here today without You  
  
I can take a plane high up in the sky and fly for a million miles
