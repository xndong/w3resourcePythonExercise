I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama  
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama

[Verse 1]  
Wake up, rise and shine, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Let's get to work on time, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
No more playing video games, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Things are about to change, 'round here, 'round here  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We used to be crazy in love  
Can we go back to how it was?  
When did you get too comfortable?  
Cause I'm too good for that, I'm too good for that  
Just remember that, hey  
  
[Chorus]  
I ain't gon' be cooking all day, I ain't your mama  
I ain't gon' do your laundry, I ain't your mama

No, I ain't your mama, no  
  
[Verse 2]  
Lucky to have these curves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Stop getting on my nerves, ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
You still tryna ride this train? Ah-yeah-yeah-yeah  
Cause some things have gotta change, 'round here, 'round here  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We used to be crazy in love  
Can we go back to how it was?  
When did you get too comfortable?

La la la  
Oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh  
Can you hear me now?  
  
This is not the girl you used to know  
Talking to you know  
I don't think you want me to explore  
It's the countdown  
It took you too long  
To find out what you want  
Right now  
I'm too gone  
To stay around  
Switching up my style  
  
Now our faces never stick around  
A.K.A  
Never hold you down  
A.K.A  
Can't figure it out  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now, oh  
You don't know me now

A.K.A  
Oh, you don't know me now  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now  
Oh, you don't know me now  
  
They all seem to want you when you go  
I was here, I was here before  
What goes around, comes back around for sure  
So I'mma let, I'mma let you know  
It took you too long  
To find out what you want  
Right now  
I'm too gone  
To stay around  
Switching up my style  
  
Now our faces never stick around  
A.K.A  
Never hold you down  
A.K.A  
Can't figure it out  
A.K.A  
You don't know me now, oh

Oh, you don't know me now

Time goes slowly now in my life  
Fear no more of what I'm not sure  
Searching to fill your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
Love, in and out of my...my heart  
And though life can be strange I can't be afriad  
Searching to fill your soul  
  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing and letting go  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be alive  
  
I guess I've found my way  
It's simple when it's right  
Feeling lucky just to be here tonight  
And happy just to be me and be  
  
... Alive... hahaha (chuckling softly)

Time, goes, slowly now in my life  
Fear, no more of what I'm not sure  
  
[Hook:]  
Searchin' to feel your soul

Feeling lucky just to be here tonight

And though life can be strange  
I can't be afraid

Searchin' to feel your soul  
The strength to stand alone  
The power of not knowing  
And letting go

Love is life and life is livin'  
It's very special  
All my love  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
(Baby, don't go)  
(Baby, don't go) Yeah  
(Baby, don't go, uh)  
(Baby, don't go) Yeah  
(Baby, don't go)  
(Baby, don't go) Yeah, yeah  
(Why you act like that)  
  
It's such a shame, but I'm leavin'  
Can't take the way you mistreated me  
And it's crazy, but oh, baby  
It don't matter, whatever, don't phase me  
  
Uh, uh, uh  
I don't believe you wanna leave like this  
I don't believe I just had my last real kiss  
I do believe we'll laugh and reminisce  
Wait a minute, don't bounce, baby,  
let's talk about this, man  
  
Well, I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son  
I gotta leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm good holdin' my spot  
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block  
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock  
So without me you'll be fine, right  
  
All my pride is all I have  
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)  
You'll be needin' me, but too bad  
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)  
The path you chose to run alone  
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah  
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)  
  
The nights I waited up for you (Oh, boy)  
Promises you made about comin' through  
So much time you wasted  
That's why I had to replace you  
  
Uh, uh, uh  
It makes a cat nervous, the thought of settlin' down  
Especially me, I was creepin' all over town  
I thought my tender touch could lock you down  
I knew I had you, as cocky as it sounds  
That's the way you used to giggle right before I put it down  
It's better when you angry, come here, I'll prove it now, come here  
  
Stop playin, you gamin'  
I gotta leave you alone  
  
'Cause I'm good holdin' my spot (Stop actin' like that)  
And I'm good reppin' the girls on the block  
(Now you know you need to stop)  
And I'm good, I got this thing on lock  
So without me you'll be fine, right (Here we go)  
  
All my pride is all I have  
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)  
You'll be needin' me, but too bad  
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)  
You had to your choice to run alone  
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah  
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)  
  
People make mistakes to make up, to break  
To wake up cold and lonely, chill, baby, you know me  
You love me, I'm like your homey  
Instead of beef you come hold me  
I promise I'm not a phony  
Don't bounce, baby, console me, come here  
  
Ain't nothin' you can say to me that can change my mind  
I gotta let you go now  
And nothin' will ever be the same, so just be on your way  
Go 'head and do your thing now  
And there's no more to explain to me, you no  
I know your game and I'm feelin' what you do  
  
So I'm bouncin' and I'm out, son  
I gotta leave you alone, yeah, yeah  
  
All my pride is all I have  
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)  
You'll be needin' me, but too bad  
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)  
You had to your choice to run alone  
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah  
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)  
  
All my pride is all I have  
(Pride is what you had, baby girl, I'm what you have)  
You'll be needin' me, but too bad  
(Be easy, don't make decisions when you mad)  
You had to your choice to run alone  
(I know you're independent, you can make it on your own)  
Here with me you had a home, oh, yeah  
(But time is of the essence, why spend it alone, huh)  
  
I promise you  
You know what I'm sayin'

Baby I never knew I could feel  
The way I felt when I felt the way  
You were feeling me baby I'm so out of control, yeah  
  
Every time you look my way  
I realize more and more  
How much I adore those pretty eyes  
Of yours I'm helpless baby  
  
What I want to know is  
Are you willing to try  
Can you love me for a lifetime  
In just one night  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Baby I love you (love you)  
Baby I need you (need you)  
I gotta have you (gotta have you babe)  
Can't be without you  
  
Blessed and cursed on the same day  
The day that I first felt the power of you  
Inside of me, such a strong feeling  
There comes a time in everyones life  
When you know, and everyone around you knows  
That everything is changed,  
You're not the same, it's a new day  
  
Oh what I want to know is,  
Are you willing to try  
There's gotta be more meaning to this  
Than what meets the eye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, I love the way you kiss me  
Oh, baby please  
I'm about to lose my mind  
0h talk to me, cause I'm begging for you  
And I'm down on my knees  
Baby, I know you're the one that I need  
  
[Chorus]

Looking at a coffee table book  
At a small cafe on Broadway  
Tryin' to find a way  
Out of all trouble and dismay  
Travelin' on a road unpaved  
Everywhere I look  
There is something there to remind me  
Of feelings from yesterday  
Listening to drama and hearsay  
Only leaves me empty  
  
You are my friend first  
We talk about what hurts  
We talk about love  
Let's talk about us  
Can't you see  
I want you to be mine  
What matters the most  
I just want to see you up close  
When I look into your heart  
You got everything I want  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
I want you to be mine  
  
Turn the music up  
Riding on the highway  
Thinking about the way  
That I feel when I'm with you  
A feeling that continues  
To make me feel good  
Even when I'm not near you  
And I want it to stay  
Emotions, I have so many  
Love can give you plenty  
But I know  
  
You are my friend first  
We talk about what hurts  
We talk about love  
Let's talk about us  
Can't you see  
I want you to be mine  
What matters the most  
I just want to see you up close  
When I look into your heart  
You got everything I want  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
(I want you to be mine)  
  
Everything he does  
All of the the above  
Didn't know it 'til I fell in love  
Fits me like a glove  
Do you know  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
Everything he does  
Fits me like a glove  
Didn't know it 'til I fell in love  
All of the the above  
Do you know  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
You do what hasn't been done before  
No one loves you more  
Than me  
Can't you see I want you to be mine?  
  
Be mine, be mine, be mine, be mine...

Well you went uptown riding in your limousine  
With your fine Park Avenue clothes  
You had the Dom Perignon in your hand  
And the spoon up your nose  
And when you wake up in the morning  
With your head on fire  
And your eyes to bloody to see  
Go on and cry in your coffee  
But don't come bitchin' to me  
  
Because you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to open up your mouth  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
You had to have the white hot spotlight  
You had to be a big shot last night  
  
They were all impressed with your Halston dress  
And the people that you knew at Elaine's  
And the story of your latest sucess  
Kept 'em so entertained  
Aw but now you just don't remember  
All the things you said  
And you're not sure you want to know  
I'll give you one hint, honey  
You sure did put on a show  
  
Yes, yes you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to prove it to the crowd  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
You're so much fun to be around  
You had to have front page, bold type  
You had to be a big shot last night  
  
Well, it's no big sin to stick your two cents in  
If you know when to leave it alone  
But you went over the line  
You couldn't see it was time to go home  
No, no, no, no, no, no, you had to be a big shot, didn't you  
You had to open up your mouth  
You had to be a big shot, didn't you  
All your friends were so knocked out  
You had to have the last word, last night  
So much fun to be around  
You had to have a white hot spotlight  
You had to be a big shot last night

[Verse:]  
I ain't a gangsta, that's just my image  
I ain't a thug either nigga, I just go along with it  
Fuck what the press tell you, listen to me  
I'm trying to tell you what's real, I don't live my life dangerously  
Live how I live, live by my rules  
You wouldn't survive just waking up in my shoes  
Yeah I dress like a thug, and talk like a gangsta  
But that don't mean I'm gonna clap at your crew  
Even if I strike rich, I'm stay with my crew  
I'ma stay with my peeps, I'ma stay in the streets  
I'ma keep spittin flames so my family could eat  
And now I'm not saying this to build my fan base  
And I don't give a fuck how many lives my hand takes  
And I'ma stay true to myself, I'm a man  
I'm a real nigga, hard to kill nigga  
Hard as a rock, I'm just Cris from the block  
Ya I'm that same troublemaking kid from the block (whut)  
[Verse 2:]  
I went from boy to man, ain't nobody gonn' stop me  
Holla Back nigga showing more hatred than the notzis  
I went from boy to man, from toys to guns  
Went from boy to man, from bottled milk to rum  
I went from boy to man, from the carriage to whips  
Now all the bitches wanna get married to Cris  
And there's Haze selling crack overseas,  
P. Diddy himself can't get rights to come and sample me  
You know I smoke to the sky and cook buckets of crack  
You that bitch ass that emptied out his budget for rap  
Biggs be the nigga that be running with gats  
Holla Back nigga, who else is fucking with that

It's a new day, new day, and it's evident  
You must have been heaven-sent  
Sometimes we should be hesitant, but I'm not at all  
Just feelin more confident  
Just using my common sense  
Just trust in it, I'm lovin it  
  
I can't refuse an offer so benevolent  
Can't assume he's gon' use me  
And after he'll never call again  
Don't be afraid, don't be afraid  
This is your day, this is your day  
  
[Chorus]  
It's time to be brave  
Say I'm not afraid, not anymore  
I used to be cold, now the temperature's changed  
It just ain't the same  
I'm not afraid, I'm not afraid  
Cus I've become brave  
As the light of day straight into a cave  
To show me the way, that I might be saved  
Now I'm turning the page  
Thanks to the power of love I can love  
Because I am brave  
  
  
I am brave, I am brave  
  
I heard him say this thing moving too fast for him  
It's a feelin I was straddeling  
Foolishly adamant, but It's all in his eyes  
Really wish he would let me in  
Cus the same way I'm scared of him  
I'm scared of being hurt again  
  
It's time to let go, let go of your heart  
It's time for a brand new start  
Never know, we might never part  
Baby don't be afraid, don't be afraid  
This is your day, this is your day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wouldn't take back anything that I've gone through (no)  
I pray for strength for anything that I'm gonna do  
Whether joy, or it's pain, I'm still okay (I, I'm still okay)  
I'm a be alright cause I'm not afraid  
No, I am brave (brave)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I am brave

Some say that we should not be together,  
And that I deserve so much better.  
But they are just blind,  
I would choose to be with you or simply die.  
You would be blind to not see how I feel,  
And that my love is strong and real.  
  
Baby can you see,  
How much you mean to me...  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too?  
  
Some people don't see very much,  
But they can see I love your every touch.  
Every now and then...  
I feel your touch upon my skin.  
It sends chills down my spine,  
I'm going to love you till the end of time.  
  
Baby can you see,  
How much you mean to me...  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too?  
  
Those who can see it all,  
Can see that it is for you I'm going to fall.  
You make me feel so happy, you make me smile.  
You make my whole life worth while.  
Sometimes baby we fight,  
But its because I love you, and its going to be alright.  
  
Baby can you see,  
How much you mean to me...  
Can you see that I would die for you  
Or are you just blind too?

Baby, never have I ever wanted anyone like I want you babe  
Come and let me show you just how much I feel inside  
I got so much love  
Oh baby, when I get near you  
Ooh, I can't control what I'm feeling  
Baby  
I got so much love to give that I would probably want all the time  
  
Carino, Carino, Carino, Carino  
I gotta have your love, Carino  
Need to feel your touch, Carino  
Never get enough, Carino, Carino  
  
I wish that I could spend all my days  
And nights wrapped in your arms  
Spending time with you 'cause all I see  
In this world is me and you and no one elase, ooh  
I want you more and more  
Oh baby, please understand me  
I think that you deserve me  
Cause I'm the type that would give you all the love  
And affection that you need  
  
Carino, Carino, Carino, Carino  
I gotta have your love, Carino  
Need to feel your touch, Carino  
Never get enough, Carino, Carino

Break it, you buy it  
Nothing's for free  
Especially my body  
Especially me  
Break it, you bought it  
I pray that you don't  
Don't do what all guys do  
Do what all guys do  
  
Just forgetting to be social  
When you turn to dishonest  
Think that running the street's worthy  
That just turns months into weeks into days  
I ain't wanna be cordial  
I'm just speaking to your conscience  
  
You want to take it but I won't give it away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin' to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins a love charade  
  
You think that you're the only that ever say  
You love me when it's over  
  
Break it, you buy it  
This one's on me  
Don't start a riot  
Don't cause a scene  
Start up a fire  
Pray that you don't  
Don't do what all guys do  
Do what all guys do  
  
Just forgetting to be social  
When you turn to dishonest  
Think that running the street's worthy  
That just turns months into weeks into days  
I ain't wanna be cordial  
I'm just speaking to your conscience  
  
You want to take it but I won't give it away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin' to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins a love charade  
  
You think that you're the only that ever say  
You love me when it's over  
  
You shoulda took your time  
Did it right when you had me, baby  
You shoulda took your time  
Shoulda took your time (when you had me)  
You shoulda took your time  
Did it right when you had me, baby  
She was playing games, all those love charades  
  
You want to take it but I won't give it a away  
Leave me in a mess I never made  
Tryin' to play a game I never learned  
No one ever wins the love charade  
  
You think that you're the only that ever say  
You love me when it's over

Running out of juice

Someone took my emotions,  
Don't forgive me,  
I didn't ask  
Someone took my emotions,  
I feel good,  
'cause I don't feel bad  
  
You said that you gon' take my heart babe  
But I don't believe in fairytale  
It's the same old thing, not a damn thing changed  
You're playing games,  
Playing games  
Now I'm taking names,  
Taking names now  
And I don't play no more, baby, this is game over  
  
Broke your heart for you could feel  
Deep we're gonna think we're real,  
We're through, me and you  
(This is)  
Tears fall down, feels like it's raining  
'Cause I don't want to feel the pain, me and you  
We're through  
  
Someone took my emotions,  
Don't forgive me, I didn't ask  
Someone took my emotions,  
I feel good, 'cause I don't feel bad

This is A fake song  
Jennifer never released it...  
  
Feat. Nelly  
  
[Chorus- Jennifer Lopez] (2x)  
I've had enough  
I'm tired of you treating me so rough  
Not coming home and then tryna play tough  
  
(Jennifer Lopez)  
What was I to do  
Though I had enough I still loved you  
Even when you played tough, you still was my boo  
When I told you we needed to break up, you refused  
Sometimes I felt used  
Cause I fell into ya trap when you begged at my shoes  
I remember you going to jail cause I was being abused  
Either stay or get bailed, wonder which one did you choose  
  
[Chorus:] (2x)  
  
(Nelly)  
From you saying damn me, To me hardballin' like Sammy  
  
And winning all these Grammy's, All I wanna do is start a family  
There's no need to worry  
So stop saying you'll do all that's neccessary  
To get me locked up in the penitentiary  
Its Nelly and J-Lo's time to bill  
I'm like Samuel L. In a time to kill  
Buy that Vokal fo'sho, and cop that Nellyville  
  
[Chorus:] (once)  
  
(Jennifer Lopez)  
From you coming home late, to you saying our love can wait  
And making all these tour dates  
Our relationship would only lead to fate  
My friends keep telling me to find another date, cause  
  
[Chorus:] (2x)

Let's play a game  
Let's just pretend like you don't know who I am  
Believe it if you say that you're not a fan  
Act like I'm interested in some other man  
  
Turn on the lights  
So that the cameras' flashing won't be so bright  
And let the crowd ain't getting big outside  
They're wanting details on how I live my life  
  
There's no escape from the fame  
To somewhere they don't know my name  
I love you I do feel your pain  
But the question still remain  
  
[Chorus]  
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?  
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?  
Can you love somebody loved by everybody?  
Can you love somebody when they're everybody's girl?  
  
Can you love the, can you love the, can you love the girl?  
Can you love the, can you love the, can you love the girl?  
Can you love the, can you love the, can you love the girl?  
Can you love her, can you love her, can you love her?  
  
Out through the back  
Too many people blocking the front door  
We go our different ways so we want more  
Another gig I got in until four  
  
There's no escape from the fame  
To somewhere they don't know my name  
I love you I do feel your pain  
But the question still remain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I love it, I love it  
Cool as summercool  
I'm flying and I love it  
She just wants to be seen  
  
Can you hang to a shooting star  
Handle distance near and far  
Don't let the jealousy and envy get to you  
'Cause I'll be running home back to you  
  
[Chorus]

Boy you give me hungry eyes  
You and I are doing it tonight

Did you expect me to reason with thunder  
I still remember when time was frozen  
What seemed forever was just a moment

Hurry up, hurry up  
There's no more waiting  
We're still worth saving

Feel the light  
Shining in the dark of night  
Remember what we forgot  
I know it's a long shot  
But we're bringing it all back  
We're bringing it all back  
  
Feel the light  
Shining like the stars tonight  
Remember what we forgot

We got artist of the year rhyming here  
Grammy nominations and platinum plus ain't nothing baby  
All I want in life, all night long  
Yo, yo, yo, yo, yo  
  
You priceless, you like diamonds and icey wrists  
We got chedda, I'm twice as rich  
Make you bite your lips, Jenny you know you like unless  
Nice and thick, if you ever leave me I'd slice my wrists  
Treat you like a bitch, never that  
We got beef where my niggaz at  
Streets is where I'm living at  
  
Where the glock, that's the sounds of the mini mack  
Where we at, uptown where its really at  
Here me yack, I want the mansion, the yacht  
Advance on the spot, we can dance till we drop  
Let my hands slip a knot  
  
Joe you the don  
  
Jenny you the bomb  
Any man disrespect, good as gone  
  
When I opened up my eyes today  
Felt the sun shining on my face  
It became so clear to me  
That everything is going my way  
I feel like there's no limit to what I can see  
Got rid of my fears that were holding me  
My endless possibilities  
Has the whole world opened up for me  
That's why I'm feeling  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing  
Can bring me down  
Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
Now the day is turning into night  
And everything is still going right  
There's no way you can stop me this time  
Or break this spirit of mine, oh no  
Like the stars above I'm gonna shine  
Anything I want will be mine  
Tonight I'm gonna have a good time  
Call a few friends of mine  
'Cause I'm loving life, and tonight's for feeling

Been taking care of myself like I should (Like I should yeah)

Nothing in this world's gonna turn me around  
  
Boricua, that's you mamacita  
Puertorican diva, from la isla bonita  
Let me freak ya on the dance floor  
Lead your man off,  
He's just trying to get your pants off  
  
That's the last straw  
Pun I ain't got a glass jaw  
Better run when you see me coming through the back door  
Crack smart, I give it all for my brother  
There's to things I don't share  
That's my money and my mother  
  
I love honeys since the paradise for real  
Seis caps some steel, this better scrap for real  
  
Shut up your grill  
You know we never fight  
It's your world girl, set it off right  
  
I'm feeling so good  
I knew that I would  
Been taking care of myself like I should  
'Cause not one thing

Well I thought you knew, thinkin' that you were true  
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up  
'Cause I've had enough  
You were there by my side, always down for the ride  
But your joy ride just came down in flames 'cause your creed sold me out in
shame  
  
After all of the stealing and the cheating you'd probably think that  
I hold resentment for you  
But uh, uh you're wrong  
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouln't know  
Just how capable I am yo pull through  
So I wanna say thank you  
'Cause it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for makin' me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for makin' me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game  
I heard you're goin round playin, the victim now  
But don't even begin feelin' I'm the one to blame  
'Cause you dug your own grave  
After all of the fights and the lies 'cause you're wanting to haunt me  
But that won't work anymore, no more  
It's over  
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture  
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down  
'Cause it  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
How could this man I thought I knew  
Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to know the truth  
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself  
Through libing in denial  
But in the end you'll see  
You-Wont-Stop-Me  
  
I am a fighter and I  
I ain't goin' stop  
There is no turning back  
I've had enough  
  
[Chorus x2]

See I know a little bit something good  
Always comes out of a little bit something bad  
And I wasn't looking for someone new  
Till you came down  
Giving me the best the time I've had  
And now you're on my skin, body to body  
Working me out, Yeah you, you play to win  
Rocking me steady, Round after round  
Ooh, ooh  
  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love Oh, oh  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Ooh, ooh I  
  
Mistakes I don't worry 'bout them no more  
'Cause you got me, I'm on Cloud 9  
So good, no I cannot just keep it real  
T-shirt and jeans  
See you making me feel so fly  
And now you're on my skin  
Body to body  
Working me out  
Yeah you, you play to win  
Rocking me steady  
Round after round  
Oh, oh  
  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Oh, oh  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love  
Ooh, ooh I  
  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name  
'Cause I  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I I I  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I wanna hear you say my name  
'Cause I  
You make me wanna ride again  
'Cause I, I I I

'Cause if you were my first  
Baby there wouldn't have been no second,  
Third or fourth love Ooh, ooh  
I wish you were my first love  
'Cause if you were my first

[Jennifer Lopez sings]  
Break it off here  
Break-break it off there  
  
Now bounce your knees back  
Alternate back and forward  
And if you doing it right  
Your hips will be doing the same thing  
  
[Jenifer Lopez]  
Now don't tell me that you love me  
Get with this  
You say you stayed forever  
But it don't make sense  
Maybe I'm...  
Hope you don't miss  
  
Cuz if not you ain't gonna get none of this  
I only wanna hear swish  
Imma big girl and I know what it is  
Pick me up at 8 yeah don't you wish  
  
[Chorus]  
Love, fresh out the oven  
Straight sugar lovin  
To the beat a lovin  
Hey  
  
X3  
You wanna  
Break it off here  
Break-break it off there  
  
Be real you can say who you are  
Everybody say that you doctor at the bar  
  
You gotta look close to find the real superstart  
You won a national...  
Open up a jar  
  
Help yourself and take a look in the mirror  
Open up your mouth and stick your tongue down far  
Just a little more... okay say ahh.  
  
[Chorus]

(I wanna be where you are)  
(Could it be I stayed away too long?)  
  
I remember I said we should split  
Had a lot goin' on And you weren't part of it  
You tryin' to reason with me I admit  
But I did  
And now I'm walkin' around so so sick  
And now I'm thinkin' for you that's a fact  
Got me missin' you Like LA misses Shaq  
What I gotta do  
On my mission to get you back  
Because I'm just that way without you  
Baby baby I  
  
Really didn't mean it  
When I said it, I'll repeat it  
I was trippin' flippin' out It was nothin'  
I was on a whole other level  
Now I got it all together  
I was sick, but now I'm better  
I was trying to push you away  
Really wanted you to stay  
Didn't know that was the case  
It was just plain crazy 'cause around here lately  
Been thinkin' about nothing but my baby  
  
If you're in Houston, Hosted in Atlanta  
(I wanna be where you are)  
  
Chillin' in New York  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
Somewhere out in Puerto Rico  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
  
If you're in Chicago Hangin' out in the MIA  
(I wanna be where you are)  
  
Maybe you can be in LA  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
I just wanna be your lady  
(Baby I gotta be there)  
  
(I wanna be where you are)  
(Could it be I stayed away too long?) 2x  
  
What's gone is gone  
And I wanna take it back  
I'm not livin' in the past  
But now I want you back  
Gotta get you, gotta get you here  
I been looking for you everywhere  
Everywhere, baby  
I'd apologize 1000 times to you if I could prove (prove)  
Baby I'm wrong and out of breath

When I said it, I'll repeat it  
I was trippin' flippin' out It was nothin'

Now I got it all together  
I was sick, but now I'm better

Where would I be without you honey  
Baby I'm me, all because I love you  
Oh you know the cars and the clothes and the cribs and the bankrolls  
Are nothing without your loving  
Although you might hear that in every love song  
It's just what I feel so I'm gonna keep on, keep on, singing your praises in
everyway I can think of  
And this is what I mean love  
  
Chorus:  
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf  
When I see you baby, I just gotta tip my ha-a-at  
Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest,
the best  
You're the highest, you're the greatest part of me  
And darling you are fi-i-ine  
When I see you baby, I just can't believe you're mi-i-ine  
Cause when I see you baby, I'm seeing the flyest, the freshest, the finest,
the best  
You're the highest, the greatest part of me  
  
Bridge:  
I said you're the shhhhh and here's my proclamation  
My way of saying thank you for your dedication  
Now I can spend the rest of my life sitting high up on cloud nine  
And all because I know I'm your lady  
And no don't nothing get better than this we steady stacking chips together  
Coping gifts and taking trips and spend it on each other  
No other can do-do what you do, cause baby you're the truth and that's why I
gotta tell you that...  
  
Chorus:  
When I see you baby, I see my better ha-a-alf

(Even when they don't)  
  
Still ain't ready to walk away and call it all over  
Act like you wasn't listening when they told ya  
They don't want to be with you anymore  
Stuck in your ways, you choose to ignore

Thought it would last but there's no forever  
Walked out on you with no call, no letter

Wakes you up out of your sleep, out of the dreams you're having  
  
Still  
(Looking for his return)  
  
Still  
(Hoping that he's gonna learn)  
  
Wake up and realize the truth, make some time for you  
What's he trying to do to you  
Miss him more as days go by  
Try your hardest not to cry and keep hope alive

Thought it would last but there's no forever  
Walked out on you with no call, no letter

Now you been holding me down mm  
For such a long time now  
From back then to now in my story  
Straight from the hood  
You've always been there for me  
  
And you had my back when they  
Back when everybody said I wasn't anything  
It was you that kept me holding on  
No matter what was going on  
So whatever you need I got you yaa  
  
Reminiscing that 6 train from way back  
Now it's sky blue Phantoms and stretch Maybachs  
For sweepin' them floors in them Bronx apartments  
Mira esta que ta on the red carpet  
When Pun died you was the first to call me  
I never told you  
But you was there for me  
Whatever you need, I be there for you

Sweating until it hurt while the music's loud  
  
Look right here baby don't stop now

Right here  
Something in the dark shot glasses, you know  
Something that you can lean to  
Something that you can ride to  
Something that you can step to  
You know  
  
Sometimes real love can be  
Not seen 'cause you're thinkin'  
What's right in front of you  
Can't be the one for you  
  
Then one day you realize that  
There are feelings that you can't hold back  
And you're so caught up  
Now that's all you think of  
Crazy how  
  
All that talk of us not able to last  
Just because of mistakes we made in the past  
But they fail to understand  
  
[Chorus]  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you  
You got me  
  
I got you  
  
Things are often said to  
Doubt what I feel for you  
But words that people say  
Won't take my love away  
Although it hurts sometimes, it's alright  
But why they say some things that ain't right  
I never know but please understand that baby, it ain't nothing  
  
All that talk of us not able to last  
Just because of mistakes we made in the past  
But they fail to understand  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, baby)  
I got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, baby)  
  
So that's all that people can do  
Never mind all the love, all that you  
gotta do is simply love, trust, and just stay focused on us  
Together we'll get through whatever if we  
Don't let speculations make situations up  
We'll be alright  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you, baby)  
You got me (you got me, babe)  
  
I got you  
And nobody can come to change a thing (feels so good inside)  
'Cause you gotta know  
You got me  
And it feels so good to have your back now  
I'm so proud  
  
I got you  
And if somebody tries to take you from me  
They will see I've got you (I got you)  
You got me (yes, you got me, baby)  
I got you (nothing come between us)  
You got me (you got me)  
I got you (through whatever)  
You got me (you're all that I need)  
I got you (oh, baby)  
You got me (forever, baby)  
I got you (I got you)  
You got me (you got me)  
I got you  
You got me

I put it down for a brother like you

We can first give you some of this, that's you  
And you're all that loving that J. Lo, true  
  
Hold up, I can get your funnel  
Pull your trigger, go and get your gun off  
Gonna tie my hair up top  
Put a pin in it, now I'm ready, let it rock  
Keep it number 1, that's easy mathematics  
Keep it number 1, baby, ain't no static  
Got that hourglass for you, baby, look at these legs  
No brakes, go green, no red

All day, 24 hour  
Feeling like I want one when it's crowded  
If you wanna hear your name, I shout it  
Boy, you the shit, go and take a power shower  
And I'm feeling like it's me and you, I don't doubt it  
You can drop it how you want, I ain't trying to count mileage

Take the pants out here, drop to her knees

Speed it up slow ma, throw it back, throw my  
Rock-rock Gators like my Detroit players  
You can hate to love us, you can love to hate us

And even though we made it to the top  
Still J. Lo from the-the the block

Oh, oh oh...  
  
This is where my story begins  
Standing here with you  
I'm about to give in  
And I'm gonna give all I can give  
Even though in previous relationships  
I might have been mischievous  
I wasn't already ready  
I admit to this  
But what a good feeling it is  
I've had a lot of crushes  
Close to nothing like this  
Everytime the subject would come  
I made up every excuse that I could think of  
I used to run but now I'm getting warmed up  
In a few words this feeling I could sum up  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need  
  
I was hangin' out with my friends  
Seven nights a week  
If there's a party I'm in  
I started getting sick of it  
But when I looked back I didn't know what it meant  
I guess I wasn't interested  
In finding something real  
Though I was looking for it  
You should've been looking for me  
But you opened up my eyes  
And now I can see  
And everytime the subject would come up  
When they say "I love you"  
Then I only dumb up  
A lot of guys  
A girl or shut up  
But you're the only guy that told me your love was endless  
A lot of words with feeling can not sum up  
But first I had to figure out who I was  
To try and understand that there ain't no shortcuts  
Now the only thing that's missing is your love  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need love  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin'  
  
I need  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real  
Baby take a chance  
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me  
And I got a lot of love to give  
Baby don't you hear me  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real  
Baby take a chance  
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me  
And I got a lot of love to give  
Baby don't you hear me  
  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Oh I need  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin  
  
I need  
  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin  
  
I need  
  
For the first time in my life  
I need love  
Ain't no love up in the club  
I need love  
Want to cuddle up to somethin'  
That make me feel like I'm somethin'  
Gettin' sick and tired of frontin  
  
I need  
  
Slow dance, hold hands  
All I want is romance  
If it's real, let me know it's real  
Baby take a chance  
'Cause I been looking for a man who could understand me  
And I got a lot of love to give  
Baby don't you hear me

First Verse  
I'm home alone again  
And you're out, hanging with your friends  
So you say, but I know it's not quite that way  
It's getting pretty late and you haven't checked on me all day  
When I called you didn't answer  
Now I'm feeling like you're ignoring me  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me, tight in your arms  
And I wish, I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Chorus  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So you couldn't hurt me  
It just ain't fair the way you treat me  
No you don't deserve me  
Wasted my time thinking about you and you ain't never gone change  
I wish I wasn't in love with you  
So I wouldn't feel this way  
  
Verse 2  
When you touch me my heart melts  
And everything you did wrong I forgive  
So you play me and take advantage  
Of the love that I feel for you  
Why you wanna hurt me so bad  
I believed in you that's why I'm so mad  
Now I'm drowning in disappointment, and its hard for me to even look at you  
  
I wish that you were home  
Holding me tight in your arms ooh baby  
I wish I could go back  
To the day before we met and skip my regret  
  
Bridge  
Said you care about me, but from what I see  
I ain't feeling that, so I disagree  
Gave you all my love and understanding and you treated me like your enemy  
So leave me alone, don't want nothing from you  
Just go back where you came from this house is no longer your home  
You you are not welcome no more  
  
Chorus (repeat 2x)  
  
Outro  
I hear you knocking at my door again  
I'm wondering should I let you in  
I open up the door and see the flowers for me  
So beautiful in your hands  
You start begging me to take you back,  
I've always been a sucker for romance  
And before you know it I can see, you're all over me  
Oh no here I go again  
  
I wish I wasn't in love with you so you couldn't hurt me

So say that you won't leave  
Cause since the day you came  
I've been glad  
  
[Chorus]

Oh Yes!  
  
I wanna be the reason you smile after you wipe your tears,  
The reason you have the courage to confront your fears,  
The reason there?s two carrots in each of your ears,  
I spurge with the paper ma, I don't care,  
How ya like the pumps, boots, jeeps, and coops  
Make celebrities, 50 fall off never,  
What?s, mine is yours and what?s yours is mine,  
So when I shine, you shine.  
C?mon the finest Champaign we can toast to life,  
Crab table in Vegas you can toss the dice,  
Don't let your friends get ya confused, said 50 bad news,  
I need ya in my life girl your too much to loose.  
  
It?s funny cause, for a while,  
I walked around with a smile but,  
Deep inside, I could hear, voices telling me this ain't right.  
Don?t you know, it?s not for you,  
I always knew what I had to do.  
But it?s hard, to get away,  
Because I love you I just tried to stay.  
  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And I know inside I?ma be alright.  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And that voice inside says I?m gonna be alright.  
  
Friends of mine, say to me,  
They say you got control over me.  
You?re not alone, I played my part,  
I saw the way you were from the start.  
Could I expect, so much from you,  
You had a girl when I first met you.  
Did the best that you could do  
Now I realize I can't change you  
  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And I know inside I?ma be alright.  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And that voice inside says I?m gonna be alright.  
  
Said I wouldn't walk away,  
Some days I want to stay,  
But leaving you is what I need to do to be okay.  
Never thought it would be true,  
Me livin' without you,  
But now it's time for me to make that move.  
  
Now when I tell ya what my wishes are you don't respect it,  
When I smile at ya you don't smile back to reconnect it.  
You ain't been gone long but, I already miss you,  
I need you next to me so I can hug you and kiss you.  
All the talkin on the phone, all the time we share,  
How could you fix your mouth to say, ?I don't care?  
I had plans for us, to buy ice together,  
Engagement rings, and things and share life together,  
Now when your friends tell ya 50 called, you?re like whatever.  
Do you think we were wrong for each other from the start,  
Or was it my actions that made us fall apart.  
Just want you to know you?ll always have a place in my heart.  
  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And I know inside I?ma be alright.  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And that voice inside says I?m gonna be alright.  
  
Oh no, be alright  
Oh no, says I?m gonna be alright  
  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And I know inside I?ma be alright.  
I used to say I couldn?t do it but I did it,  
After telling everybody that I wasn't with it,  
Though it brings tears to my eyes, I can feel it  
And that voice inside says I?m gonna be alright.

And all of that change since I met you  
So we can leave that old shit in the restroom  
Young Money!  
  
You got me and I could not defend it

Pussy so wet, I need a wet suit  
You're way too fly, I could be your jet fuel  
Now tell me what you like, I like what you tell me  
And if you understand me, then you can overwhelm me  
It's too late, it's too late  
Every finish line is the beginning of a new race, haaa  
  
When I look into your eyes, it's over (yeah)  
You got me hooked with your love controller

Called you on the phone  
Said I'm comin' through  
Hope your all alone  
Cause I got plans for you  
  
We could stay at home  
Or dance and hang all night  
As long as I'm with you  
Doesn't matter what we do  
  
Don't ask me where I've been  
Or what I'm gonna do  
Just know that I'm here with you  
Don't try understand  
Baby there's no mystery  
Cause you know how I am

What you get is what you see  
What you tryin' to do to me  
You want to say your mine  
Be with me all the time  
You're falling so in love  
And you just can't get enough  
You're tellin' all your friends  
She's a bad, bad bitch  
  
You like the way I dress  
The way I wear my hair  
Show me off to all your friends  
And baby I don't care  
Just as long as you  
Tell them who I am  
Tell them I'm the one who made you give a damn  
  
Don't ask me where I've been  
Or what I'm gonna do  
Just know that I'm here with you  
Don't try understand  
Baby there's no mystery  
Cause you know how I am

It's invading my mind  
And breaking the ice  
Whoa oh oh  
I can't fight it  
This feeling's invading my, my mind  
I'm infected tonight  
I can't fight it  
Whoa oh oh, I can't fight it  
So take it invading my mind  
  
Can't decide, can't define  
What I feel inside  
It's so bad, it's still good  
Prefer and love  
It's a rush, it's so rough  
This is out of line  
It's a storm and it rock,  
Rock, rocks my mind  
My destiny, misery  
Your energy

My mind, my mind, my mind, my mind, my mind  
So take it invading my my mind  
  
Like a wild wrecking ball  
Crashing block by block  
I'm defenseless, it penetrates my walls  
Freezing cold, steaming hot  
Sweaty drip drip drop  
It's unstoppable, I can't shake it up  
My destiny, misery  
You energy  
  
It's invading my mind  
And breaking the ice  
Whoa oh oh

It seemed to be like the perfect thing for you and me  
Its so ironic you're what I had pictured you to be  
But there are facts in our lives that we can never change  
Just tell me that you understand and feel the same  
This perfect romance that I created in my mind  
I'd live a thousand lives each one with you right by my side  
And yet we find ourselves in a less than perfect circumstance  
And so it seems like we'll never have the chance  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Sometimes I think that a true love can never be  
I just believe that somehow it wasnt meant for me  
Life can be cruel in a way that I can't explain  
And I don't think that I could face it all again  
I barely know you but somehow I know what you're about  
A deeper love I found and you and I no longer doubt  
You touhced my heart and it altered every plan I made  
And now I feel that I don't have to be afraid  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
I locked away my heart but you just set it free  
Emotions I felt held me back from what my life should be  
I pushed you far away and yet you stayed with me  
I guess this means that you and me were meant to be  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life  
And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right  
Aint it strange how fate can play a part  
In the story of your heart  
  
Aint it funny how some feelings you just can't deny  
And you can't move on even though you try  
Aint it strange how you're feeling things you shouldnt feel  
Oh I wish this could be real  
Aint it funny how a moment could just change your life

And you don't wanna face whats wrong or right

In the story of your heart

Once upon a magazine  
There I saw a beauty queen  
And she challenged me to be something I could not be  
She had the looks, the kind that kill.  
With one look I felt so incomplete and obsolete  
I can't compete, you can't compete...  
So I'm lookin' in the mirror I'm tryin' to see mine,  
Not the traces of the faces that I've seen a million times...  
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life  
I don't have to change...  
  
CHORUS  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
So, you want a perfect girl  
In a mini skirt and pearls  
With a lovely disposition and changeable opinions  
That may be nice, but here's the facts...  
I won't sacrifice true love that lasts, for house and cash  
I can't do that, I won't do that  
  
So I'm lookin' in the mirror and I can't believe my eyes  
Cause I'm seeing what's inside me for the very first time  
With Jesus in my life, Jesus in my life  
I don't have to change a thing  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl  
  
Gotta get your influence from something real  
So c'mon live your life girl...  
God will give you the hope  
If you just imagine  
All that He can do if you want Him to  
  
I'm a girl  
Livin' in the world  
Where wrong is right and my body is more important than my mind.  
So come on girls, we've got to get together  
You know we can't give up...  
Ya know, it's hard enough to be a girl (Repeat)

All I need is a place to be  
And a way to feel  
A space to figure out where I belong  
A chance to know my thoughts  
And find a way to show  
What I feel...  
And if this is real...  
Yeah  
  
Don't wanna disappoint you  
Don't wanna let you down  
Cause that's the last thing I would do  
I'm asking for your patience  
I realize I could loose you  
But lately I've been so confused  
  
I've been thinkin' (thinking)  
You've been on my mind (on my mind)  
So I've been praying (praying)  
To find a way that I (a way that I)  
Can be sure, the way that (the way that)  
You've been sure with me (sure with me)  
Don't you want that from me  
  
Wondering endlessly if this is right or wrong  
Or if it's just about me all along  
All I need is time to search within my soul  
So I can share a deeper part of me...  
Yeah  
  
Don't wanna disappoint you  
Don't wanna let you down  
Cause that's the last thing I would do  
I'm asking for your patience  
I realize I could loose you  
But lately I've been so confused  
  
I've been thinkin' (thinking)  
You've been on my mind (on my mind)  
So I've been praying (praying)  
To find a way that I (a way that I)  
Can be sure, the way that (the way that)  
You've been sure with me (sure with me)  
Don't you want that from me  
  
Baby, what's meant to be (what was meant to be)  
Will surely be (will surely be baby)  
If you love me baby you would understand  
But I can't give you anything (can't give you anything)  
If I don't have myself to give (if I don't have myself to give)  
And it's killing me inside...  
  
I've been thinkin' (thinking)  
You've been on my mind (on my mind)  
So I've been praying (praying)  
To find a way that I (a way that I)  
Can be sure, the way that (the way that)  
You've been sure with me (sure with me)  
Don't you want that from me  
  
I've been thinkin' (thinking)  
You've been on my mind (on my mind)  
So I've been praying (praying)  
To find a way that I (a way that I)  
Can be sure, the way that (the way that)  
You've been sure with me (sure with me)  
Don't you want that from me

Children grow and women producing  
Men go working  
Some go stealing  
Everyone's got to make a living  
  
L O X  
J. Lo

Went from a little to a lot this year

From In Living Color and movie scripts  
To On the 6 to J. Lo to this headline clips

Nothin phony, don't hatethe red hair

Rockin this business

I'm in control and loving it  
Rumors got me laughing, kid  
Love my life and my public  
Put God first  
Then can't forget to stay real  
To me it's like breathing  
  
Don't be fooled by the cocks that I get

It take hard work to cash checks  
So don't be fooled by the rocks that I got, now assets  
You get back what you put out  
Even if you take the good route  
Can't count the hood out  
After a while, you know who to blink with  
Just keep it real with the ones came in with  
Best thing to do is stay low, LOX and J.Lo  
Act like they don't, but they know  
  
Don't be fooled by the rocks that I got  
I'm still, I'm still timmy from the block  
Used to have a little, now I get a lot

Taking back my love (7X)  
  
You said you'd change  
But still nothin'  
You're still the same  
I'm just a part-time lover  
And I'm the blame  
Shoulda went away  
But yet I stayed...  
With a part-time lover  
  
See some days you would love me  
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't,  
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone.  
Now you got me stressin' out on the phone  
But it's the last time  
I'm moving on  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (9X)  
  
I left the state  
And changed everything  
No more 818  
For the part-time lover  
What goes around  
Comes back around  
And then you get what you deserve  
You part-time lover  
  
See some days you would love me  
Then you don't, then you do, then you won't,  
Then you're here, then you're gone, I'm alone.  
Now you got me stressin out on the phone  
But it's the last time  
I'm moving on  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (9X)  
  
Watch these red bottoms  
And the back of my jeans  
Watch me go by babe  
  
You don't know what you got until it's gone  
Tail lights is all you'll see  
Watch that Benz exit that driveway  
  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (9x)  
  
Watch me walk it out  
Walk it out (2X)  
Walk this right up out the house  
Walk it out  
Boy, watch me walk it out  
Walk it out  
Walk this right up out the house  
I'm throwin on my Louboutins (out the house) (8X)

I don't  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
When you rolled up in the Escalade  
Saw that truck you gave to the valet  
Knew that it was game when you looked at me  
Pulling up your sleeve so I could see the Rolley bling  
Saw you later in the corner booth  
Raising up a toast so I would notice you  
But your heart's a mess  
Think you outta know  
Doesn't matter if you're balling out of control  
  
All that matter's is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money can't buy yeah  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You don't  
You think I'm gonna spend your cash  
I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I don't  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
When I took a chance  
Thought you'd understand  
Baby credit cards aren't romance  
So you're tryna buy what's already yours  
What I need from is not available in stores  
Seen a side of you that I really feel  
Doing way too much, never keep it real  
If it doesn't change, gotta hit the road  
Now I'm leaving, where's my keys?  
I've got to go  
  
All that matter's is  
That you treat me right  
Give me all the things I need  
That money can't buy yeah  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You don't  
You think I'm gonna spend your cash  
I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I don't  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
A thing, a thing, a thing  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You think the money that you make  
Can substitute the time you take  
Take the keys here to my heart  
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart  
I think you need to take some time  
To show me that your love is true  
There's more than dollar signs in you  
Then you can win my heart, and get what's in my heart  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You don't  
You think I'm gonna spend your cash  
I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I don't  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
  
You think you gotta keep me iced  
You don't  
You think I'm gonna spend your cash  
I won't  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing  
Think I wanna drive your Benz  
I don't  
If I wanna floss I got my own  
Even if you were broke  
My love don't cost a thing

Would you mind  
If I took the time to get to know you  
Cause its been a while since all we been through  
And even though I said my feelings wouldn't change  
Nothing stays the same, oh  
I can see  
When I look in your eyes you mean no harm  
It's just the way you manipulate me with your charm  
And I can tell the love I have for you still strong  
And there ain't nothin' wrong with me still lovin' you  
  
After all that we been through  
Found myself still lovin you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing  
Never gave up on the love we had  
We just need to take it slow  
  
In the past  
You would act as if you don't really care  
You fight and argue almost anywhere  
Lookin' back sometimes I feel like such a fool  
For putting up with you oh  
Baby please, understand if it seems I'm confused  
Its just that it might take me  
Some time to get used to you  
When I think of all the things we used to do, baby  
I just find myself still lovin' you  
  
After all that we been through  
Found myself still lovin' you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing  
Never gave up on the love we had, baby  
We just need to take it slow  
  
I believe you and me had a chance to make this right  
Oh baby if your heart is in it  
I'm still with it  
Even after all of this time has passed  
Oh I'm still lovin' you  
  
After all that we been through, yea  
Found myself still lovin' you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing  
Never gave up on the love we had, baby  
We just need to take it slow  
  
After all that we been through  
Found myself still lovin' you  
But I think we need to take the time to get it right  
Cause I never gave up on a good thing, never give up  
Never gave up on the love we had, love we had  
We just need to take it slow

Strangers always got some mess to spread  
But I have learned to flick them off  
Can't walk a mile in my YSLs  
I strap them on and I walk it off  
  
Got 'em saying: I can't believe  
She did it no she didn't  
My wild factor's got them crazy  
Got 'em saying: yea she did it  
But I can't believe it  
Never said you can't believe  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes  
  
My strut's so fierce  
Steven's gotten mad at me  
Laugh and talk behind my back  
But they'll never get the best of me  
I see 'em doing my dance  
I hear 'em singing my song  
I'm surpassing the rest  
Cause that's how I was raised to do it  
  
Got 'em saying: I can't believe  
She did it no she didn't  
My wild factor's got them crazy  
  
Got 'em saying: yea she did it  
But I can't believe it  
Never said you can't believe  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lace them up right  
Honey these ones are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes  
  
I'm walkin tall  
I don't let their hatred test me  
They bite the dust  
Head over water, they still can't breathe  
My feet pound the ground  
As I stomp it out  
I dare you to walk a mile in my shoes  
  
Even if they try  
They still can't walk a mile in these shoes  
They couldn't even lay some up right  
Honey these walks are too big to fill  
Ten million men can't walk a mile in these shoes

Took a shot, with the bad boy from the block  
Picked my love right from the start  
Mister wrong, he plays his part  
Back to the beginning, now round two  
Try my luck with something new  
We danced until we said, "I do"  
My luck is bad, no more us, two  
No me and you  
  
[Chorus]  
Is it too much to ask  
For a real love,  
Something that'll last?  
Is there one love?  
Only once in a lifetime?  
It's so hard to find  
The perfect one to call mine  
Is there one love?  
Somebody that compliments me?  
And makes me wanna never leave?  
Made just right for me?  
Is there one love, one love,  
One love, one love?  
  
It's take three, could there be a part for me?  
Came and swept me off my feet  
Went nowhere but kept the ring  
Once again I'm lonely  
Number four, he sang to me but I'm not sure  
So worn out, but love just saw  
Made me wanna try once more  
And I couldn't say no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What's wrong with the girl  
Who wanted everything  
Good love, real trust, true meaning?  
Who truly completes me?  
I'm good on my own, but I have to know  
  
Is there one love  
Only once in a lifetime?  
It's so hard to find  
The perfect one to call mine  
Is there one love?  
Somebody that compliments me?  
And makes me wanna never leave?  
Made just right for me?  
  
Is there one love, one love,  
One love, one love?  
Is there one love, one love,  
One love, one love?  
Is there one love?

You must be thinking how did I get here  
And I wonder if you've been here before  
So many things I want to ask you, and know about you  
You seem like you are ready to run  
Stand right up and walk out that door  
Oh yes you've been here before  
But for this moment you're all mine  
So let's just take it one step at a time  
  
One step at a time  
No need to rush  
Let's keep this time for us  
And make it lasts as long as we can  
It's already going too fast  
  
I would spend my lifetime wondering why  
He chose me for you and you for I  
You have things to teach me  
I have a feeling inside  
I have this vision of three of us  
Holding hands  
Through a valley and jumping towards the sky  
  
But one step at a time  
We will take it one step at a time  
  
One step at a time  
No need to rush  
Let's keep this time for us  
And make it lasts as long as we can  
It's already going too fast  
  
How can three become one,  
You're the greatest thing tha I've ever done  
I wanna create a world  
You will always want comeback to  
And here's my wish for both of you  
  
One step at a time  
No need to rush  
Let's keep this time for us  
And make it lasts as long as we can  
It's already going too fast

[Chorus]  
Baby come with me  
I know I can set you free  
If you take this trip with me  
You'll be open off my love  
If only for one night  
  
I know I can make you mine  
Touch you in that place you like  
You'll be open off my love  
Take a moment to stop and think about  
The last time you felt like this  
Come on baby, nobody's gonna see  
'Cause I know you're feeling me  
I can see it in your eyes  
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide  
When I touch you get hot  
Then I got you where I want you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't waste another moment  
Don't hold back  
I'm gonna give you what you need  
I'm gonna take you where you want to go  
On a trip to ecstasy  
I can see it in your eyes  
Ain't no use in tryin' to hide  
When I touch you get hot  
Then I got you where I want you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wanna be where he wants me to be  
When he wants me to be  
When he wants me  
I'm gonna keep him feelin' me  
I'm gonna keep him wanting me  
I wanna be where he wants me to be  
When he wants me to be  
When he wants me  
I'm gonna keep him up all night  
I'm gonna keep it on his mind  
  
[Chorus]

I don't understand why I'm crazy  
Over you, I don't know what to do,  
I don't understand why I'm crazy,  
Over you I don't know what to do,  
  
If I had to,  
I would give up everything just to feel and be with you,  
If I had to,  
I would pawn the ring you gave to me just to feed you,  
If I had to,  
I would give my very last breath just to help save you,  
If I had to,  
I would tell a lie just because I know you are the truth,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
Only you,  
  
If I had to  
I would throw away my only wish just to prove to you,  
If I had to,  
I would die all alone, if living meant without you,  
If I had to,  
I would go through all the pain again, just to find you,  
If I had to,  
I'd surrender all my love, just because I love you,  
  
I don't understand why I'm crazy,  
Over you I don't know what to do,  
I don't understand why I'm crazy,  
Over you I don't know what to do,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
I wanna run to you, breathe as one with you,  
Absent in time without you, existing only for you,  
Every dream is of you, only turn to you,  
Baby, my love,  
Only for you,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
I'm gonna ride for you ooh,  
  
I'd ride for you,  
Cuz your the truth,  
I'd die for you,  
Ooh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you,  
And i'll do anything that pleases you,  
  
Only you  
I'd ride for you  
Cuz ur the truth  
I'd die for you  
Oh cuz I'm a fool inlove with you  
And I'd do anything that pleases you  
Yeaaahh...

We got it locked, they know, that  
Whenever we around it goes down like Draino  
And it's nothing to spend these pesos  
And you will never see us with a fake one  
You can call it in the low, low  
Police on our arms with a thousand in the trunk  
Ain't nothing greater, hanging out the window  
Straight busting at you law haters  
  
Bonny Clyde  
No other girl will ever ride like I ride  
That's why you need me on your passenger side  
Let me help you get that paper  
Hanging out the window busting at them love haters  
Me and you,  
I'm the closest you'll ever be to truth  
There's never a question of what I'll do  
Uh huh for you with me you'll never lose so,  
  
[Chorus]  
Call on your girl that can hold you right  
I'll be your protector I'll never forget you  
You need somebody that can hold you tight  
I'll be in your arm love  
Keep you out of harm boy  
I'll be your anything, everything  
Rockin' roll with you  
If things get to hot out in the cold with you  
Froze froze with you, me and you together  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world  
I'll be your anything everything rockin' roll with you  
If things get too hot out in the cold with you  
Froze, froze with you  
Me and you together our love could run the world  
[Repeat: x15]  
Run  
  
Make it through any weather baby  
Don't pay them any attention  
It'll just drive you crazy  
All that really matters is our love for one another  
And all we'll ever have is each other  
Let her chit-chatter come around  
Lord knows she'll never be done  
She'll never have your back, wouldn't know how to act  
I can't say it all better than that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our love could run the world  
  
Don't you see, there's no love no like you and me  
Can't you see, baby there's nobody more powerful than we  
Can't you see that I'm the only thing you'll ever need  
Can't you see that, can't you see  
  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Run the world (uh-oh, uh-oh)  
Our love could run the world  
I'll be your anything everything rockin' roll with you  
If things get too hot out in the cold with you  
Froze, froze with you  
Run the world, our love could run the world  
[Repeat: x15]  
Run  
  
Run the world, our love could run the world

It's killing me  
I'm losing sleep  
And I'm waking up tired (of it all)  
3 in the morning  
And it's starting already  
With my name always involved  
  
I try to get rid of the baggage  
Fake friends I call them "has-been"  
Yeah they lying on stuff  
And I don't care if they don't show me love (no)  
  
So they want me to lie down  
They want me to crawl  
They want me to cry now  
But I've never fallen off  
  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Cuz in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
I'm just the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
  
Tell me what I gotta do  
I'm tryna make it clear to you  
Not dealing with the attitude  
I'm tired of tryna make you see that I'm still me  
So I check my longitude and latitude  
You're in my way, you better move  
Knowing everyone is tryna bring me down  
Ohh baby (ohh baby)  
  
So they want me to lie down  
They want me to crawl  
They want me to cry now  
But I've never fallen off  
  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Why you tryna put the world up on my shoulders?  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Too damn grown, I don't owe nobody  
Get off of me  
Get off of me  
Cuz in the end I'm still the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
I'm just the same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)  
Same girl (same girl)

I remember last christmas eve  
Something happened that I couldn't believe  
I went for a walk while the snow came down  
And when it stopped, I was in a different town  
And the sign said have no fear, your not lost your here  
  
Chorus:  
  
Walkin this christmas  
Down santa claus lane  
No need to wonder  
No need explain  
Just have some faith in what you see  
Your right here where you wanna be  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane.  
Down santa claus lane  
  
Elves were standing in the street  
Snowmen and reindeer came out to greet  
Silver bells chimed from far away  
As Santa rode by in an open sleigh  
And he told me have no fear  
Your not lost your here  
  
Chorus:  
Walkin this christmas  
Down santa claus lane  
No need to wonder  
No need to explian  
Just have some faith in what you see  
Your right here where you wanna be  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane  
Down santa claus lane  
  
I don't know how  
I don't know when  
But one day i'll be back again  
  
And he told me have no fear  
Your not lost your here....  
  
Chorus:  
  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane  
No need to wonder  
No need to explain  
Just have some faith in what you see  
Your right here where you want to be  
Walkin this christmas down santa claus lane  
(santa claus lane)  
Down santa claus lane  
Down santa claus lane  
(santa claus lane)  
Down santa claus lane

It's like I'm lost  
I don't know  
But this feeling  
That I have about you  
Will you ever know?  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
Whatever I see  
When I look at you across the room  
Whatever I hear  
I wonder if he loves me too  
Whatever I do  
I just think about you for hours  
Oh baby  
Has got me thinking of you  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
Whenever you speak  
Whenever you move  
Whenever you breath  
Baby let me touch you  
Please  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
Secretly  
I'm wanting you  
And I'm hoping you want me too  
I smell your scent across the room  
And I can't wait to get next to you  
  
It smells so good  
I just want to ... kiss you  
I want to ... lay with you  
I don't know how to tell you

I've been so caught up in the thought of me and you  
Even though I love someone else, I know my heart belongs to you  
Maybe we should just try to hide the things we feel inside,  
Things I know we can't deny  
  
[Chorus:]  
Should've never told you that I cared about you  
Didn't think that it would be so bad  
Should've never kissed you  
Should've never held your hand  
  
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go  
What did I do the day I let you slip into my soul (My soul)  
It was then, when I realized that I would always want you in my life  
(In my life)  
No one else, can know of the things that we were saying on the telephone  
It would be, so bad if they ever knew that me and you were secretly into each
other  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gotta find a way to let these feelings go  
Oh, I'm so scared, trembling inside 'cause I'm feelin' like somebody else  
Already knows  
Oh, my god, I love you boy so much but to have to choose between the two,  
is hurting me so deep inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't ever want to feel this way again  
  
[Chorus]

Disco dancing with the lights down low  
Beats are pumping on the stereo  
Neighbours banging on the bathroom wall  
Your sayin' crank the bass  
I gotta get some more  
  
Waters runnin' in the wrong direction  
Got a feelin' its a mixed up sign  
I can see it in my own reflection  
Something funnies goin' on inside my mind  
Don't know what its pushin' me higher  
Its the static from the floor below  
Then its drops and catches like a fire  
Its a sound I, Its a sound I know  
  
It's the sound of the underground  
The beat of the drum goes round and around  
In to the overflow  
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio  
Out to the electric night  
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights  
The beat goes around and round  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
  
Chain reaction running through my veins  
Pumps the bass line up into my brains  
Screws my mind until I lose control  
And when the building rocks I know Its got my soul  
  
Waters runnin' in the wrong direction  
Got a feelin' its a mixed up sign  
I can see it in my own reflection  
Something funnies goin' on inside my mind  
Don't know what its pushin' me higher  
Its the static from the floor below  
Then its drops and catches like a fire  
Its a sound I, Its a sound I know  
  
It's the sound of the underground  
The beat of the drum goes round and around  
In to the overflow  
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio  
Out to the electric night  
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights  
The beat goes around and round  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
  
I don't know what it's pushin' me higher  
It's the static from the floor below  
And then it drops and catches like fire  
Its a sound I, Its a sound I  
Its a sound I, Its a sound I Know  
  
It's the sound of the underground  
The beat of the drum goes round and around  
In to the overflow  
Where the girls get down to the sound of the radio  
Out to the electric night  
Where the bass line jumps in the backstreet lights  
The beat goes around and round  
Its the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
  
The bass line jumps in the backstreet light  
It's the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground  
The bass line jumps in the backstreet light  
It's the sound of the under  
Sound of the underground

Yeah .. Whoo!  
  
Through the bumpy roads the others bite the dust  
'cause they be thinking there in love when their in lust  
But cliche breakin' up so easy  
I'm about to throw a curve ball honey  
People let the stormy weather push them out  
Back against the road it's easy to be over  
  
Don't Sweat the little things wake up  
Stay together  
It's a new break up  
  
Everyday I think how we done it  
Every way that we can keep lovin'  
Toe to toe  
So strong and on and on  
We up and runnin'  
Not a day goes by without dreamin'  
Not A Thing Goes Out Just Keep Reachin'  
Through The Storm We Stay Warm And On And On  
We Keep On Lovin'  
  
This time is in our favor  
This time comes second nature  
Heartbreaks are overrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
Boy we done started something serious  
'Cause romance is underrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
  
Through the bumpy roads the others bite the dust  
And seems like everyone's giving up when  
These days breaking up is so cliche  
Hear 'em screaming out, "Baby no please stay"  
People wanna always hurry up and wait for  
Somebody better than the person they won't stay for  
They Sweat The Little Things Wake Up  
Stay together  
It's the new breakup  
  
Everyday I think how we done it  
Every way that we can keep lovin'  
Toe to toe  
So strong and on and on  
We up and runnin'  
  
Not a day goes by without dreamin'  
Not A Thing Goes Out Just Keep Reachin'  
Through The Storm We Stay Warm And On And On  
We Keep On Lovin'  
  
This time is in our favor  
This time comes second nature  
Heartbreaks are overrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
Boy we done started something serious  
'Cause romance is underrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
  
(Hey, yeah...)  
  
And though there will be the nights of fights  
We must face it  
It's like a rollercoaster  
Ups and downs will come  
As long as we hold tight  
And never act complacent  
Remember how we built this  
Then our love is never done  
  
Everyday I think how we done it  
Every way that we can keep lovin'  
Toe to toe  
So strong and on and on  
We up and runnin'  
Not a day goes by without dreamin'  
Not A Thing Goes Out Just Keep Reachin'  
Through The Storm We Stay Warm And On And On  
We Keep On Lovin'  
  
This time is in our favor  
This time comes second nature  
Heartbreaks are overrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
Boy we done started something serious  
'Cause romance is underrated  
Stay together  
That's the new trend  
  
(Hey, uh!)

Do you remember what you said to me the day I met you  
Like yesterday I still can hear your voice, you promised to be  
Still in my life no matter what you had to do to be there  
Well, it's been a while and here we are lookin' back on times that we shared  
  
I still imagine us being young and so in love  
Never apart, you were my heart  
Seems like it's always just been us  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said I'd be your girl  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around  
Still around (yeah)  
  
I still believe in all the things you said to me in those days  
You gave me love and kept your word with every promise you made  
I sing your favorite song inside my head when you're not with me  
Until you come back home and take me in your arms and hold me  
  
I can imagine us being old and still in love  
Never apart, you are my heart  
Makes me smile, we're still in love  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said I'd be your girl  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around  
  
Looking back through all the years  
  
Heh  
You remember the first time I went to your house  
And your father looked at me like I had three heads  
(And I will never forget the day)  
Heh  
We were so in love  
(Looking back through all the years)  
You were so beautiful and so young  
(And I will never forget the day you came into my life and what you said to
me)  
I can't believe you're still mine  
That's crazy  
I love you  
  
I remember we were in the park (we were in the park)  
Holding hands and you said to me (holding hands)  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete (and I would your life complete)  
If I said I'd be your girl  
You would stay with me forever (I'm still your girl)  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around (I'll never let you down, my baby)  
  
I remember we were in the park  
Holding hands and you said to me  
I'm the only thing you need  
And I would make your life complete  
If I said I'd be your girl (said I'd be your girl and)  
You would stay with me forever  
Boy, you never let me down  
Through it all you're still around  
Still around (yeah)

He could be the hottest man alive  
But he can't hold a flame up to you and I  
'Cause I'm so much better when I'm standing by your side  
And I can do anything  
As long as your in my life  
Since you been around  
All I ever wanna do is try to hold you down  
And there's nothin', nothin' that I can do  
'Cause you make me feel like...  
  
I can stop a train if I want to,  
Can't nothin' get in my way  
'Cause I got you  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
I can tell the sun when to shine  
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
You got me singin' yeah, yeah, yeah I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
  
You're something like a drug,  
Impossible to stop me when I'm trippin' off of love  
I always run back 'cause I never get enough  
'Cause boy, you're my everything  
That's why I need you in my life  
And no it ain't a thing  
I reach up in the sky, grab a cloud and make it rain  
And there's nothin', nothin' that I can do  
'Cause you make me feel like...  
  
I can stop a train if I want to,  
Can't nothin' get in my way  
'Cause I got you  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
I can tell the sun when to shine  
But I wouldn't need to 'cause baby, you're my life  
And baby, we can rule the world, 'cause with you I'm stronger, stronger  
You got me singin' yeah, yeah, yeah I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger  
  
Baby, you make me better daily  
Even when no one else is around  
And can't nobody show me all the love that you give me  
And that's why I'm gonna hold you down  
So when you want me  
I'll give my all,  
'Cause you be there to catch me whenever I start fallin'  
When I'm with you, I get stronger everyday  
That's why I say... (oh oh oh)  
  
'Cause with you I'm stronger, stronger.  
I can stop a train if I want to,  
Can't nothin' get in my way  
'Cause I got you

Yeah, yeah, yeah 'cause with you I'm stronger, I'm stronger

Come and whisper to me of a time  
When you felt like this  
With a unimaginable kiss that's made especially for me  
You can't avoid it  
I'm telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
You would melt away in my hands  
  
Chours:  
Dream with me  
Come and let me feel it  
The pasion that was born in me  
With the fire of your love  
Just one more night  
I wantto be next to you and fly  
Be your vice and a little more  
The wish for your love  
I want to provoke you slowly now that I have you here  
What noboy else is suppose to give  
That's what I'm giving you  
You can't avoid it  
I'm telling you to look  
If I carressed you  
You'd melt away in my hands  
  
(Chours)  
Here you have me, I'm all yours  
What you've been looking for in me, I'm giving to you

1 - Do you know where you're going to?  
Do you like the things that life's been showing you  
Where are you going to?  
Do you know?  
  
2 - Do you get  
What you're hoping for  
When you look behind you  
There's no open door  
What are you hoping for?  
Do you know?  
  
Once we were standing still in time  
Chasing the fantasies  
That filled our minds  
You knew how I loved you  
But my spirit was free  
Laughing at the questions  
That you once asked of me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Now looking back at all we've planned  
We let so many dreams  
Just slip through our hands  
Why must we wait so long  
Before we'll see  
How sad the answers  
To those questions can be  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Repeat 2  
Repeat 1 till fade

How can you just say that you love me yet to leave you alone  
You said these walls were here to protect us, but it's still not a home  
All these questions that are burning inside with answers I'll never know  
'Cause you're the only one who knows how you feel, but you're not letting me
know  
  
What is it, love  
Can I help you  
I see where this has gone and what it's coming to  
I look to you  
Enough  
  
Chorus:  
I can't believe this is me  
Where I can touch and not feel you  
I feel I'm lost in a dream  
Between what is and what seems  
Having to face not to need you  
You know you owe it to me  
How can you think we don't need you  
I'm tired of running away from my fear and the day  
That our life has no meaning  
Without a word or a reason  
Like a coward, you're leaving  
  
Sitting here inside an empty room that was filled with us  
Only boxes to define what was left of what we used to call love  
It's sad that after all of this time, you have nothing to say  
Ooh, and the only thing that you could've done, you choose to walk away  
  
I'm thankful, love  
I don't hate you  
'Cause I'd rather live and know than what you put me through  
I needed you  
Somehow  
  
I can't believe this is me  
Where I can touch and not feel you  
I feel I'm lost in a dream  
Between what is and what seems  
Having to face not to need you  
How could you do this to me  
How could you think we don't need you  
I'm tired of running away from the fear and the day  
That our life has no meaning  
Without a word or a reason  
Like a coward, you're leaving  
  
I can't believe this is me  
I wasn't wont to believe you  
I feel I'm lost in a dream  
Between what is and what seems  
Having to face not to need you  
How could you do this to me  
How could you think we don't need you  
I'm tired of running away from my fear of the day  
That our life has no meaning  
Without a word or a reason  
Like a coward, you're leaving

[Chorus]  
First you say that you have to go away  
I never should have been with you anyway  
Now you say you want to stay  
It's too late, 'cause I'm sending you on your way  
You say that you have to go away  
I never really loved you anyway  
Now you say you want to stay  
It's too late, it's too late  
  
Like a puppet on a string  
You came and took control of me  
Would've given anything  
To be your one and only  
Filled my head with fantasies  
Of what one day you'd give to me  
Full of hope for what could be  
(I sat and waited patiently)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For a time you were for me  
Everything that I could need  
Gave me time and diamond rings  
But something else was missing  
You never stayed the whole night through  
I suffered, prayed and cried for you  
After all that we've been through  
I feel I never even knew you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no need to call me on the phone  
I don't wanna hear from you no more  
No need, don't call  
Don't be a fool and stand outside my door  
'Cause being the woman that I am  
I got to go on with other plans  
  
[Chorus]

I was down for the count  
Feeling like I've come to the end  
Nothing really mattered  
Nothing left for me to mean, ooh  
  
And then you came  
And I still couldn't see  
Till you tore down every wall in me  
How you healed me with your patience  
If it's all I ever do  
I'll never stop loving you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe  
And there ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it  
I'm in love and it's all because of you  
I was fading but you pulled me through  
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die  
And there ain't no doubt about it  
It's love and I have found it  
Feel the beat again, stronger than before  
I'm gonna give you my heart until it beats no more  
  
I was in a place full of pain  
With a broken down heart in despair  
He took away my feelings  
And made it hard for me to care, oh  
But then you crashed through the door, to my soul  
Put back all the pieces and made me home  
I was living in the past, oh no  
Now I'm never looking back, I'm never looking back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whatever you want me to  
I'm gonna see you through  
All that I ever do  
Never stop loving you  
  
'Cause I'm alive, I can breathe, I can feel, I believe  
And there ain't no doubt about it, there ain't no doubt about it  
I'm in love and it's all because of you  
I was fading but you pulled me through  
Fading but you pulled me through  
'Cause I'm awake, I survived, I was hurt, thought I'd die  
And there ain't no doubt about it  
There's just no doubt  
Feel the beat again, stronger than before  
I wanna give you my heart until it beats no more

Goddess on the mountain top  
Burning like a silver flame  
The summit of beauty and love  
And Venus was her name  
  
She's got it  
Yeah, baby, she's got it  
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
  
Her weapons were her crystal eyes  
Making every man mad  
Black as the dark night she was  
Got what no one else had  
Wah!  
  
She's got it  
Yeah, baby, she's got it  
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
  
Venus  
  
She's got it  
  
Yeah, baby, she's got it  
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
  
Goddess on the mountain top  
Burning like a silver flame  
The summit of beauty and love  
And Venus was her name  
Wah!  
  
She's got it  
Yeah, baby, she's got it  
I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
Well, I'm your Venus, I'm your fire  
At your desire  
  
Venus was her name  
  
Yeah baby she's got it  
Yeah baby she's got it  
Yeah baby she's got it  
Yeah baby she's got it

Like a movie scene,  
In the sweetest dreams,  
I have pictured us together  
Now to feel your lips,  
On my finger tips,  
I have to say is even better  
Than I ever thought it could possibly be  
It's perfect, it's passion, it's setting me free  
From all of my sadness,  
The tears that I've cried, I have spent all my life  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight  
  
Tender words you say,  
Take my breath away,  
Love me now, and leave me never  
Found a sacred place, lost in your embrace,  
I want to stay in this forever  
I think of the days when the sun used to set,  
On my empty heart,  
All alone in my bed  
Tossing and turning emotions were strong, I knew I had to hold on  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight  
  
Gone are the days when the sun used to set,  
On my empty heart all alone in my bed  
Tossing and turning,  
Emotions were strong  
I knew I had to hold on  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
When you would be here in my arms  
Waiting for tonight, Oh  
I've dreamed of this love for so long  
Waiting for tonight, Oh

I can't wait, wanna see  
How this night is gonna be  
Just a touch, away  
From a feeling that is here to stay  
We can make it last forever baby  
Our love will stand the test of time  
In the middle of our world  
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine  
  
We're walkin' on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky, I, I, I  
  
Take my hand and close your eyes  
Say the sweet little things that make me cry  
Catch my tears with a kiss  
These special moments do exist  
We can make it last forever baby  
Our love will stand the test of time  
In the middle of our world  
I'll be waiting for you to be all mine  
  
We're walkin' on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky, I, I, I  
  
Let's take a chance and try love baby  
No I'm not givin' up  
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life  
Until the end of time  
  
We're walkin' on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky, I, I, I  
  
Let's take a chance and try love baby  
No I'm not givin' up  
Till you tell me that you'll be in my life  
Until the end of time  
  
We're walkin' on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky, I, I, I  
We're walkin' on sunshine  
In the middle of the night  
And it feels like I'm somewhere above the sky, I, I, I  

[Verse:]  
Whatever you don't know  
Baby, I will teach you  
Anywhere you go  
Know my love can reach you  
Not a wall too high  
Or a mountainside  
Could keep me from seeing you  
  
[Verse:]  
Whenever you're too tired  
I could give you power  
Go the extra mile  
In your darkest hour  
Any day or night  
Call my name and I  
I'll come running to be with you  
  
[Verse:]  
And I'll be fierce as a tiger  
If anyone tries to fight ya  
But I'll be soft as a lamb  
When you're in my hands  
I can bend  
However I need to  
  
[Chorus:]  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love  
  
[Verse:]  
I will understand  
When you need space  
I will hold your hand  
When you're in pain  
I'll be patient and pause  
Most relationships  
Require a give and take  
  
[Verse:]  
And I will never let my ego  
Nor the words of other people  
Get in the way  
Or stop from saying  
How much I care and I need you  
  
[Chorus:]  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love  
  
[Bridge:]  
For better or for worse  
That's what I call love... Baby  
It's more than just a word  
Let me show you my love... Baby  
  
(Chorus 2)  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
My fears and my flaws  
You stand through it all  
That's what I call love  
  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love  
That's what I call love
