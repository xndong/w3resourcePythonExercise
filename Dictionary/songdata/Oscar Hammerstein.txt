[Spoken] It's a very ancient saying,  
But a true and honest thought,  
That if you become a teacher,  
By your pupils you'll be taught.  
  
[Singing] As a teacher I've been learning --  
You'll forgive me if I boast --  
And I've now become an expert,  
On the subject I like most.  
  
[Spoken] Getting to know you.  
  
[Singing] Getting to know you,  
Getting to know all about you.  
Getting to like you,  
Getting to hope you'll like me.  
  
Getting to know you,  
Putting it my way,  
But nicely,  
You are precisely,  
My cup of tea.  
  
[Anna and the mothers]  
  
Getting to know you,  
Getting to know all about you.  
Getting to like you,  
Getting to hope you'll like me.  
  
Getting to know you,  
Putting it my way,  
But nicely,  
You are precisely,  
  
[Anna]  
  
My cup of tea.  
  
[All]  
  
Getting to know you,  
Getting to feel free and easy  
When I am with you,  
Getting to know what to say  
  
Haven't you noticed  
Suddenly I'm bright and breezy?  
Because of all the beauty and new  
Things I'm learning about you  
Day by day.  
  
Getting to know you,

It ain't so much a question of not knowin' what to do  
I knowed what's right an' wrong since I've been ten  
I've heard a lot of stories and I reckon they're true  
About how girls are put upon by men  
I know I musn't fall into the pit  
But when I'm with a feller  
I ferget!  
  
I'm just a girl who cain't say no  
I'm in a terrible fix  
I always say 'come on, let's go'  
Just when I oughta say 'nix'  
  
When a person tries to kiss a girl  
I know she oughta give his face a smack!  
But as soon as someone kisses me  
I somehow sorta want to kiss him back!  
  
I'm just a fool when lights are low  
I cain't be prissy an' quaint  
I ain't the type that can faint  
How can I be what I ain't  
I cain't say no  
  
Watcha gonna do when a feller gets flirty  
And starts to talk purty  
Whatcha gonna do?  
Supposin that he says  
Your lips are like cherries  
Or roses or berries  
Whatcha gonna do?  
  
Supposin that he says  
That yer sweeter than cream  
And he's gotta have cream or die  
Whatcha gonna do when he talks that way?  
Spit in his eye?  
  
I'm just a girl who cain't say no  
Cain't seem to say it at all  
I hate to disserpoint a beau  
When he is payin' a call!  
  
Fer a while I act refined and cool  
A settin on the velveteen setee  
Then I think of that ol' golden rule  
And do fer him what he would do fer me  
  
I cain't resist a Romeo  
In a sombero and chaps  
Soon as I sit on their laps  
Somethin' inside of me snaps  
I cain't say no!  
  
I'm just a girl who cain't say no  
Kissin's my favorite food  
With or without the mistletoe  
I'm in a holiday mood!  
  
Other girls are coy and hard to catch  
But other girls ain't havin' any fun  
Every time I lose a wrastlin' match  
I have a funny feeling that I won  
  
Though I can feel the undertoe  
I never make a complaint  
'Till it's too late for restraint  
Then when I want to I cain't  
I cain't say no!

Poor Jud is daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
All gather round his coffin now and cry  
He had a heart of gold  
And he wasn't very old  
Oh why did such a fella have to die  
  
Poor Jud is daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
He's looking oh so peaceful and serene  
  
And serene!  
  
He's all laid down to rest  
With his hands across his chest  
His fingernails have never looked so clean  
  
And then the preacher'd get up and he'd say: "Folks, we are gathered  
Here to mourn and growl our brother Jud Fry, who hung himself up  
By a rope in a smokehouse, and then we have been weepin' and  
Wailin' within some of the women. " And then he'd say: "Jud was the  
Most misunderstood man in the territory. People used to think he was  
A mean, ugly fella and they called him a dirty skunk and a northern  
Pig stealer.  
  
But the folks that really knowed 'I'm  
Knowed that neath those dirty shirts he always wore  
There beated a heart as big as all outdoors  
  
As big as all outdoors  
  
Jud Fry loved his fellow man  
  
He loved his fellow man  
  
He loved the birds of the forest  
And the bees of the field  
He loved the mice and the vermin in the barn  
And he treated the rats like equals, which he knew was right!  
And he loved the little children  
He loved everybody and everything in the world  
Only he never let on, so nobody ever noticed  
  
Poor Jud is Daid  
Poor Jud Fry is daid  
His friends all weep and wail from miles around  
  
Miles around!  
  
The daisies in the dell will give out a different smell  
Because poor Jud is underneath the ground  
  
Poor Jud is daid, the candle lights his head  
He's layin' in a coffin made of wood  
  
Wood  
  
And folks are feelin' sad cause they used to treat him bad  
Now they know their friend has gone for good  
  
Good  
  
Poor Jud is daid, a candle lights his head  
He's lookin oh so pretty and so nice  
He looks like he's asleep  
It's a shame that he won't keep  
But it's summer and we're runinng out of ice  
  
Poor Jud... Poor Jud

We work and work  
From week to week  
At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
And English words are all we speak  
At the Royal Bangkok...  
[Anna interrupts then starts them over]  
From week to week  
At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
And English words  
Are all we speak  
At the Royal Bangkok Academy  
If we pay attention to our teacher  
And obey her every rule,  
We'll be grateful for  
Those golden years  
At our dear old school.  
The Royal Bangkok Academy,  
Our dear old school.

This is a man who thinks with his heart,  
His heart is not always wise.  
This is a man who stumbles and falls,  
But this is a man who tries.  
  
This is a man you'll forgive and forgive,  
And help protect, as long as you live...  
He will not always say  
What you would have him say,  
But now and then he'll do  
Something  
Wonderful.  
  
He has a thousand dreams  
That won't come true,  
You know that he believes in them  
And that's enough for you.  
  
You'll always go along,  
Defend him when he's wrong  
And tell him, when he's strong  
He is  
Wonderful  
He'll always  
Needs your love  
And so he'll get your love.  
A man who needs your love  
Can be  
Wonderful.  
  
She'll always go along  
Defend him when he's wrong  
And tell him when he's strong  
He is wonderful.  
He'll always need her love  
And so he'll get her love  
A man who needs your love  
Can be wonderful.

[KING]  
  
A woman is a female who is human,  
Designed for pleasing man, the human male.  
A human male is pleased by many women,  
And all the rest you hear is fairy tale.  
  
[ANNA]  
  
Then tell me how this fairy tale bagan, sir.  
You cannot call it just a poet's trick  
Explain to me why many men are faithful  
And true to one wife only.  
  
[KING]  
  
[Spoken] They are sick!  
[Singing] A girl must be like a blossom  
With honey for just one man.  
A man must be like honey bee  
And gather all he can.  
To fly from blossom to blossom  
A honey bee must be free,  
But blossom must not ever fly  
From bee to bee to bee.

Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But that's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!  
  
I'd like to say a word for the farmer  
  
Well, say it!  
  
He come out west and made a lot of changes  
  
That's right!  
  
He come out west and built a lot of fences  
And built 'em right across our cattle ranges!  
  
Why don't you dirt strangers go back to Missouri Where you belong?  
  
We got just as much right here!  
  
Shut up!  
The farmer a good in criticism  
No matter what the cowman says or thinks  
You seldom see 'I'm drinkin in a bar room  
  
Unless somebody else is buying drinks!  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
The cowman ropes a cow with ease  
The farmer steals her butter and cheese  
That's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!  
  
I'd like to say a word for the cowboy  
  
You would!  
  
The road he treads is difficult and stony  
He rides fer days on end with just a pony for a friend  
  
I sure am feeling sorry for the pony!  
  
The farmer should be sociable with the cowboy  
If he rides by an' asks fer food and water  
Don't treat 'I'm like a louse  
Make him welcome in your house  
  
But be sure that you've locked up your wife and daughters!  
  
(They all offend themselves at the same time and fight)  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But that's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
Gun shot  
  
Ain't nobody gonna slug anything! This here's a party!  
Break it up ya two ol' fools! Alright, Andrew, sing it.  
Dum-dah-dee-um-dum-dum  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
  
Oh the farmer and the cowman should be friends  
One man likes to push a plow  
The other likes to chase a cow  
But that's no reason why they can't be friends  
  
And when this territory is a state  
An' joins the Union just like all the others  
The farmer, the cowman, and the merchant  
Must all behave theirselves and act like brothers  
  
I'll teach you all a little sayin'  
And learn the words by heart the way you should  
I don't say I'm no better than anybody else  
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!  
  
I don't say I'm better than anybody else  
But I'll be danged if I ain't just as good!  
  
Territory folks should stick together  
Territory folks should all be pals  
Cowboys dance with the farmer's daughters  
Farmers dance with the rancher's gals!

They feel so sentimental  
About the Oriental,

Inside down down and upside out!  
  
(Wives)  
Upside out and inside down!

To brusie and pinch our little toes-  
Our feet are cramped in leather shoes-  
They'd break if we had brittle toes,  
But now they only hurt!  
Ah... H!

Whenever they advise us  
To learn to make the same mistake  
That they are making too!  
... H!  
  
(All)  
They make quite A few!

(Nettie)  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
  
When you walk through a storm  
Keep your chin up high  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
At the end of the storm  
Is a golden sky  
And the sweet, silver song of the lark  
  
(Chorus sings with Nettie)  
  
Walk on through the wind  
Walk on through the rain  
Though your dreams be tossed and blown  
Walk on, walk on with hope in your heart  
And you'll never walk alone  
You'll never walk alone
