Do you know what's worth fighting for,  
When it's not worth dying for?  
Does it take your breath away  
And you feel yourself suffocating?  
Does the pain weigh out the pride?  
And you look for a place to hide?  
Did someone break your heart inside?  
You're in ruins  
  
One, twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One, twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky,  
You and I  
  
When you're at the end of the road  
And you lost all sense of control  
And your thoughts have taken their toll  
When your mind breaks the spirit of your soul  
Your faith walks on broken glass  
And the hangover doesn't pass  
Nothing's ever built to last  
You're in ruins  
  
One, twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One, twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky,  
You and I  
  
Did you try to live on your own  
When you burned down the house and home?  
Did you stand too close to the fire?  
Like a liar looking for forgiveness from a stone  
  
When it's time to live and let die  
And you can't get another try  
Something inside this heart has died  
You're in ruins  
  
One, twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One, twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky,  
  
One, twenty one guns  
Lay down your arms  
Give up the fight  
One, twenty one guns  
Throw up your arms into the sky,  
You and I

Born into Nixon, I was raised in hell  
A welfare child where the teamsters dwelled  
The last one born and the first one to run,  
My town was blind from refinery sun  
  
My generation is zero  
I never made it as a working class hero  
21st century breakdown  
I once was lost but never was found  
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind  
To the 20th century deadline  
  
I was made of poison and blood  
Condemnation is what I understood  
Video games of the Tower's fall  
Homeland security could kill us all  
  
My generation is zero  
I never made it as a working class hero  
21st century breakdown  
I once was lost but never was found  
I think I'm losing what's left of my mind  
To the 20th century deadline  
  
We are the class of the class of thirteen  
Born in the era of humility  
We are the desperate in the decline  
Raised by the bastards of 1969  
  
My name is no one, your long lost son  
Born on the fourth of July  
Raised in the era of heroes and cons  
That left me for dead or alive  
  
I am a nation, a worker of pride  
My debt to the status quo  
The scars on my hands there a means to an end  
Is all that I have to show  
  
I swallowed my pride and choked on my faith  
I've given my heart and my soul  
I've broken my fingers and I've lied through my teeth  
The pillar of damage control  
  
I've been to the edge  
And I've thrown the bouquet of flowers left over the grave  
I sat in the waiting room, wasting my time  
And waiting for Judgment Day  
  
I praise liberty  
The freedom to obey  
Is the song that strangles me  
Well don't cross the line  
  
Oh, dream, America, dream  
I can't even sleep  
From the light's early dawn  
Oh, scream, America, scream  
Believe what you see  
From heroes and cons

I sit in the state of a daydream  
With all of your words flying over my head  
Even more time gets wasted  
In a daze  
  
It should seem obvious to you  
Your screams and cries are never going to work  
And all of your time gets wasted  
In my daze  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I'm looking back now  
At where I have gone wrong  
And why I could not seem to get along  
My interests are longing  
To break from these chains  
These chains that control  
My future's aim  
  
I sit in the state of a daydream  
With all of your words flying over my head  
Even more time gets wasted  
In a daze  
  
Maybe I'm just too damn lazy  
Or maybe I was just brainwashed to think that way  
And all of your time gets wasted  
In my daze  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm looking  
Back now at  
Where I have  
Have gone wrong  
And why I  
Could not seem  
Could not seem  
To get along  
  
[Chorus]

My mental stability reaches its bitter end  
And all my senses are coming unglued  
Is there any cure for this disease  
Someone called love  
Not as long as there are  
Girls like you  
  
Everything she does questions my mental health  
It makes me loose control  
I just can't trust myself  
  
If someone can hear me slap some sense in me  
But you turn your head and I end up talking to myself  
Anxiety has got me strung out and frustrated  
So I loose my head or bang it up against the wall  
  
Sometimes I wonder if I should be left alone  
And lock myself up in a padded room  
I'd sit and spew my guts out to the open air  
No one wants to hear a drunken fool  
  
I do not mind if this goes on  
Cause now it seems I'm too far gone  
I must admit I enjoy myself  
Eighty please keep taking me away

What brings you around?  
Did you lose something the last time you were here?  
You'll never find it now  
It's buried deep with your identity  
  
So stand aside and let the next one pass  
Don't let the door kick you in the ass  
  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
Don't even try  
  
Exit out the back  
And never show your head around again  
Purchase your ticket  
And quickly take the last train out of town  
  
So stand aside and let the next one pass  
Don't let the door kick you in the ass  
  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
Don't even try  
  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
There's no return from 86  
Don't even try

[I. Her Man's Been Gone]  
  
Her man's been gone  
For nigh on a year  
He was due home yesterday  
But he ain't here  
  
Her man's been gone  
For nigh on a year  
He was due home yesterday  
But he ain't here  
  
[Ii. Crying Town]  
  
Down your street your crying is a well-known sound  
Your street is very well known, right here in town  
Your town is very famous for the little girl  
Whose crying can be heard all around the world

[Spoken]  
We have a remedy.  
We have!  
  
Little girl, stop your crying?  
Cause Ivor the Engine Driver's gonna make you feel all right  
  
[Iv. Ivor The Engine Driver]  
  
My name is Ivor  
I'm an engine driver  
  
I know him well  
I know why you feel blue  
Just 'cause he's late  
Don't mean he'll never get through  
  
He told me he loves you  
He ain't no liar, I ain't either  
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver  
So let's have a smile for an old engine driver  
  
Please take a sweet  
Come take a walk with me  
We'll sort it out  
Back at my place, maybe  
  
It'll come right  
You ain't no fool, I ain't either  
So why not be nice to an old engine driver?  
Better be nice to an old engine driver  
Better be nice to an old engine driver  
  
[V. Soon Be Home]  
  
We'll soon be home  
We'll soon be home  
We'll soon  
We'll soon, soon, soon be home  
  
We'll soon be home  
We'll soon be home

We'll soon, soon, soon be home  
  
We'll soon be home  
Soon be home...  
  
[Vi. You Are Forgiven]  
  
Dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang, dang  
  
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello  
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello  
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello  
Cello, cello, cello, cello, cello, cello  
  
I can't believe it  
Do my eyes deceive me?  
Am I back in your arms?  
Away from all harm?  
  
It's like a dream to be with you again  
It's like a dream to be with you again  
  
I missed you and I must admit  
I kissed a few and once did sit  
On Ivor the Engine Driver's lap  
And later with him, had a nap  
  
You are forgiven, you are forgiven, you are forgiven... [ad lib]  
  
You are forgiven

Is your heart singing out of tune  
Are your eyes just singing the blues  
Dirty records from another time  
Some blood stains on your shoes  
  
No one really knows about your soul  
And I barely really know your name  
Burning rhythms and posting lies  
And a bunch of fools drown in shame  
  
Amy don't you go  
I want you around  
Singin' woah, please don't go  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?  
  
Did you tattoo a lucky charm  
To keep you out of harms way?  
Warding off all evil signs  
But it never really kept you safe  
  
Now you're too young for the golden age  
'Cause the record bin's been replaced  
Twenty seven, gone without a trace  
And you walked away from your drink  
  
Amy don't you go  
I want you around  
Singin' woah, please don't go  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?  
  
Amy please don't go  
Amy please don't go  
  
Is your heart singing out of tune  
Are you eyes just singing the blues?  
Dirty records from another time  
Some blood stains on your shoes  
  
May I have this last dance  
By chance if we should meet?  
Can you write me a lullaby?  
So we can sing you to sleep  
  
Amy don't you go  
I want you around  
Singin' woah, please don't go  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?  
Do you wanna be a friend of mine?

Hey old man in woman's shoes  
I wonder if he knows I think he's crazy  
When he was young did he have dreams  
Of wearing woman's shoes and being crazy?  
  
It makes me wonder when I grow to be that age  
Will I be walking down the street begging for your spare change  
  
Or will I grow that old?  
Will I still be around?  
The way I carry on I'll end up  
Six feet underground  
And waste away...  
  
When the old man was in school  
Did the golden rule make him go crazy  
Or did he hide away from hopes  
Behind a smile and smoking dope  
It's crazy  
  
It seems so frightening  
Time passes by like lightning  
Before you know it you're struck down  
I always waste my time on my chemical emotions  
It keeps my head spinning around.

Hey there, lookin' at me  
Tell me, what do you see?  
But you quickly turn your head away  
Try to find the words I could use  
Don't have the courage to come up to you  
My chance is looking a bit gray  
  
[Chorus]  
Staring across the room  
Are you leaving soon?  
I just need a little time  
  
What is it that drives me mad?  
Girls like you that I never had  
What is it about you that I adore?  
What makes me go so insane  
That makes me feel so much pain?  
What is it about you that I adore?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why did you have to leave so soon?  
Why did you have to walk away?  
Oh well, it happened again  
She walked away with her boyfriend  
Maybe we'll meet again some day

I've got a knack for fucking everything up  
My temper flies and I get myself all wound up  
My fuse is short and my blood pressure is high  
I lose control and I get myself all wound up  
Tension mounts and I fly off the wall  
I self destruct and I get myself all wound up  
Petulance and irritation sets in  
I throw a tantrum and I get myself all wound up  
Chip on my shoulder and a leech on my back  
Stuck in a rut and I get myself all wound up  
Killed my composure and it will never come back  
Loss of control and I get myself all wound up  
Blown out of proportion again  
My temper snaps and I get myself all wound up  
Spontaneous combustion  
Panic attack  
I slipped a gear and I get myself all wound up

[Intro]  
This is definitely not the first video to surface of an execution. ...of men,
they claimed responsibility for the executions. Described as severely mentally
disturbed. It appears to show another hostage executed by the terrorist group.
Deserve to be annihilated.  
  
[Verse 1]  
I get my kicks and I wanna start a rager  
I wanna dance like I'm on the video  
I got a fever for the violent behavior  
I'm sweatin' bullets like a modern Romeo  
[Chorus]  
Bang, bang, give me fame  
Shoot me up to entertain  
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy  
You're dead, I'm well fed  
Give me death or give me head  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier  
  
[Verse 2]  
I testify like a lullaby of memories  
Broadcasting live and it's on my radio  
I got my photobomb, I got my Vietnam  
I love a lie just like anybody else  
  
[Chorus]  
Bang, bang, give me fame  
Shoot me up to entertain  
I am a semi-automatic lonely boy  
You're dead, I'm well fed  
Give me death or give me head  
Broadcasting from my room and playin' with my toys  
I wanna be a celebrity martyr  
The leading man in my own private drama  
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier  
  
[Bridge]  
I wanna be like the soldiers on the screen  
It's my private movie (Holy War)  
Oh baby, baby, this is Viva Vendetta  
Oh this is love or it's World War Zero  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna be a celebrity martyr  
The leading man in my own private drama  
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier  
I wanna be a celebrity martyr  
The leading man in my own private drama  
Hoorah, bang, bang, hoorah, bang, bang, the hero of the hour  
Daddy's little psycho and mommy's little soldier

Do you have the time to listen to me whine  
About nothing and everything all at once  
I am one of those  
Melodramatic fools  
Neurotic to the bone  
No doubt about it  
  
Sometimes I give myself the creeps  
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me  
It all keeps adding up  
I think I'm cracking up  
Am I just paranoid?  
Or am I just stoned  
  
I went to a shrink  
To analyze my dreams  
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down  
I went to a whore  
He said my life's a bore  
So quit my whining cause it's bringing her down  
  
Sometimes I give myself the creeps  
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me  
It all keeps adding up  
I think I'm cracking up  
Am I just paranoid?  
A ya-ya-ya  
  
Grasping to control  
So I better hold on  
  
Sometimes I give myself the creeps  
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me  
It all keeps adding up  
I think I'm cracking up  
Am I just paranoid?  
Or am I just stoned?

Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
Of another place and time  
Where my family's from.  
  
Singing  
I can hear them singing.  
When the rain had washed away  
All these scattered dreams  
  
Dying  
Everyone's reminding  
Hearts are washed in misery  
Drenched in gasoline  
  
Laughter  
There is no more laughter  
Songs of yesterday  
Now live in the underground  
  
Life before the lobotomy  
Christian sang the eulogy  
Sign my love a lost memory  
From the end of the century  
  
Well, it's enough to make you sick  
To cast a stone and throw a brick  
When the sky is falling down  
It burned your dreams into the ground  
  
Christian's lesson is what he's been sold  
We are normal and self-controlled  
Remember to learn to forget  
Whiskey shots and cheap cigarettes  
  
Well I'm not stoned  
I'm just fucked up  
I got so high I can't stand up  
I'm not cursed 'cause I've been blessed  
I'm not in love 'cause I'm a mess  
  
Like refugees  
We're lost like refugees  
Like refugees  
We're lost like refugees  
The brutality of reality  
Is the freedom that keeps me from  
  
Dreaming  
I was only dreaming  
Of another place and time  
Where my family's from.  
  
Singing  
I can hear them singing.  
When the rain had washed away  
All these scattered dreams  
  
Dying  
Everyone's reminding  
Hearts are washed in misery  
Drenched in gasoline  
  
Laughter  
There is no more laughter  
Songs of yesterday  
Now live in the underground

Hey Ho! Lets Go!  
Hey Ho! Lets Go!  
Hey Ho! Lets Go!  
Hey Ho! Lets Go!  
  
You're fallin' in a straight line.  
You're going through a tight wind.  
The kids are losing their minds.  
The Blitzkrieg Bop!  
  
We're piling in the back seat.  
We're generating steam heat.  
Pulsing to the backbeat.  
Blitzkrieg Bop!  
  
Hey ho, lets go.  
Shoot'em in the back now.  
What they want, I don't know.  
They're all reved up and ready to go.  
  
They're forming in a straight line.  
They're going through a tight wind.  
The kids are losing their minds.  
The Blitzkrieg Bop!  
  
They're piling in the back seat.  
They're generating steam heat.  
Pulsating to the back beat.  
The Blitzkrieg Bop!  
  
Hey ho, let's go.  
Shoot'em in the back now.  
What they want, I don't know.  
They're all reved up and ready to go.  
  
(Ya!)  
  
Hey Ho! Lets Go!  
Hey Ho! Lets Go!  
Hey Ho! Lets Go!  
Hey Ho! Lets Go!

[Verse 1]  
I walk a lonely road  
The only one that I have ever known  
Don't know where it goes  
But it's home to me and I walk alone  
  
[Verse 2]  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of broken dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I walk alone  
I walk alone  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a...  
  
[Chorus]  
My shadow's only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone  
  
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm walking down the line  
That divides me somewhere in my mind  
On the border line of the edge  
And where I walk alone  
  
Read between the lines  
What's fucked up and everything's all right  
Check my vital signs to know I'm still alive  
And I walk alone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I walk alone  
I walk alone  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a...  
  
[Chorus]  
My shadow's only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone  
  
Ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah, aah-ah  
Ah-ah, ah-ah  
  
I walk alone  
I walk a  
  
[Verse 4]  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of broken dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk a  
  
[Chorus]  
My shadow's only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
Till then I walk alone

I walk a lonely road  
The only one that I have ever known  
Don't know where it goes  
But it's home to me and I walk alone  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk alone  
  
By now you should've somehow  
Realized what you gotta do... I walk alone I walk alone  
I don't believe that anybody  
Feels the way I do... I walk alone I walk alone about you now  
  
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me  
'Til then I walk alone'  
  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Aaah-ah,  
Ah-ah, Ah-ah, Ah-ah (in the background all the way to I'm walking down the
line)  
  
Every day I wake up and it's Sunday  
Whatever's in my head won't go away  
The radio is playing all the usual  
And what's a wonderwall anyway  
  
Backbeat the word was on the street  
That the fire in your heart is out  
I'm sure you've heard it all before  
But you never really had a doubt  
I don't believe that anybody feels  
The way I do about you now  
  
I'm walking down the line  
That divides me somewhere in my mind  
On the border line  
Of the edge and where I walk alone  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you  
  
Read between the lines  
What's fucked up and everything's alright  
Check my vital signs  
To know I'm still alive and I walk alone  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you... I walk alone I walk alone  
By now you should've somehow  
Realized what you gotta do... I walk alone I walk alone  
  
And all the roads we have to walk along are winding  
And all the lights that lead us there are blinding  
There are many things that I would  
Like to say to you  
I don't know how  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
  
Today is gonna be the day  
That they're gonna throw it back to you  
  
I walk this empty street  
On the Boulevard of Broken Dreams  
  
By now you should've somehow  
Realized what you gotta do  
  
Where the city sleeps  
And I'm the only one and I walk a...  
  
Cuz maybe  
  
My shadow's the only one that walks beside me... Saves me  
My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating... Saves me  
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me... Saves me  
'Til then I walk alone'  
  
Sing with me (Sing!)  
Sing for the year (Sing It)  
Sing for the laughter sing for the tear (C'mon!)  
Sing it with me Just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away...

I'm having trouble trying to sleep  
I'm counting sheep but running out  
As time ticks by  
And still I try  
No rest for crosstops in my mind  
  
On my own, here we go  
  
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed  
Dried up and bulging out my skull  
My mouth is dry  
My face is numb  
Fucked up and spun out in my room  
  
On my own, here we go  
  
My mind is set on overdrive  
The clock is laughing in my face  
A crooked spine  
My senses dulled  
Passed the point of delirium  
  
On my own, here we go  
  
My eyes feel like they're gonna bleed  
Dried up and bulging out my skull  
My mouth is dry  
My face is numb  
Fucked up and spun out in my room  
  
On my own, here we go

Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days  
They're getting over the hill  
Death is closing in and catching up  
As far as I can tell  
Got a plan of action and cold blood  
And it smells of defiance  
I'll just wait for Mom and Dad to die  
And got my inheritance  
Now I want more  
Cause I'm getting bored  
And I'm going nowhere fast  
I was once filled with doubt  
Now it's all figured out  
Nothing good can last  
Crows feet and rot are setting in  
And time is running out  
My parent's income interest rate  
Is gaining higher clout  
I'm a snot nosed slob  
Without a job  
And I know I damn well should  
Mom and Dad don't look so hot these days  
But my future's looking good

Hey where did we go, days when the rains came?  
Down in the hollow, playin' a new game  
Laughing and a running hey, hey! Skipping and a jumping  
In the misty morning fog with our hearts a thumpin' and you...  
My brown eyed girl  
You, my brown eyed girl  
Whatever happened Tuesday and so slow?  
Going down the old mine with a transistor radio  
Standing in the sunlight laughing, hiding behind a rainbow's wall  
Slipping and sliding, , all along the water fall, with you...  
My brown eyed girl  
You, my brown eyed girl  
Do you remember when we used to sing?  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  
... La te da  
So hard to find my way, now that I'm all on my own  
I saw you just the other day, my, how you have grown!  
Cast my memory back there, Lord, sometimes I'm overcome thinking 'bout  
Rolling in the green grass, behind the stadium with you...  
My brown eyed girl  
You, my brown eyed girl  
Do you remember when we used to sing?  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  
Sha la la la la la la la la la la te da  
... La te da

I declare I don't care no more  
I'm burning up and out and  
Growing bored  
In my smoked out boring room  
My hair is shagging in my eyes  
Dragging my feet to hit the  
Street tonight  
To drive along these shit  
Town lights  
I'm not growing up,  
I'm just burning out  
And I stepped in line  
To walk amongst the  
Dead  
  
Apathy has rained on me  
Now I'm feeling like a  
Soggy dream  
So close to drowning but  
I don't mind  
I'll live inside this mental cave  
Throw emotions in the grave  
Hell, who needs them  
Anyway  
So close to drowning but  
I don't mind  
I've lived in this mental cave  
Throw my emotions in the grave  
Hell, who needs them  
Anyway

Breaking in a sweat  
Like a bomb threat  
Is your silhouette fading out?  
Nothing left to lose  
Detonate the fuse  
Another breaking news blowout  
  
Ain't it beautiful?  
So unusual  
Life's a gas and it's running out  
Living a cliche  
Gonna seize the day  
Bottle rockets and celebrate, celebrate, celebrate  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
What's worth forgiving?  
Alright  
  
The blink of an eye  
Barely scraping by  
Dominated by passer by's  
Feeling out of luck  
When the traffic's stuck  
And you're feeling  
So left behind  
  
Getting off a binge  
Get a second wind  
Another promise  
Just make a change  
Got a Broken wing  
Hear the angels sing  
With a signal that's out of range  
Ain't it strange?  
Ain't it strange?  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
What's worth forgiving?  
Alright  
  
Making a living  
Making a killing  
What's worth forgiving?  
Alright  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?  
  
Carpe diem, a battle cry  
Are we all too young to die?  
Ask a reason and no reply  
Are we all too young to die?

I'm on a sentimental journey  
Into sight and sound  
Of no return and no looking back or down  
A conscientious objector to the  
War that's in my mind  
Leaving in the lurch and I'm  
Taking back what's mine  
  
I'm on a mission  
Into destination unknown  
An expedition  
Onto desolation road  
(where I'm a...)  
  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Lost and found, trouble bound,  
Castaway  
  
I'm riding on the night train and  
Driving stolen cars  
Testing my nerves out on the blvd.  
Spontaneous combustion in the  
Corners of my mind  
Leaving in the lurch  
And I'm taking back what's mine  
  
I'm on a mission  
Into destination unknown  
An expedition  
Onto desolation road  
(where I'm a...)  
  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Castaway-going at it alone  
Castaway-now I'm on my own  
Lost and found, trouble bound,  
Castaway

Chocolate Rain!  
Some stay dry and others feel the pain  
Chocolate Rain!  
A baby born will die before the sin  
Chocolate Rain!  
The school books say it can't be here again.  
Chocolate Rain!  
The prisons make you wonder where it went  
Chocolate Rain!  
Build a tent and something in your sink  
Chocolate Rain!  
A baby born will never cry again  
Chocolate Rain!  
Only in the [?] was they say  
Chocolate Rain!  
Raise your neighborhood insurance rates  
Chocolate Rain!  
Make us happy living in a gay  
Chocolate Rain!  
Made me cross the street the other day  
Chocolate Rain!  
Made you turn your head the other way  
Chocolate Rain!  
Made you turn your head in history  
Chocolate Rain!  
I don't know the words but again  
Chocolate Rain!  
Seldom mentioned on the radio  
Chocolate Rain!  
It's the failure leader's call control  
Chocolate Rain!  
Worse than swearing worse than calling names  
Chocolate Rain!  
Then they say it publicly and say  
Chocolate Rain!  
No one wants to hear about it now  
Chocolate Rain!  
Orlando Bloom was good in that one movie  
Chocolate Rain!  
Makes best friends begin to fight and stuff  
Chocolate Rain!  
Worse than swearing worse than calling names  
Chocolate Rain!  
Then they say it publicly and say  
Chocolate Rain!  
No one wants to hear about it now  
Chocolate Rain!  
Orlando Bloom was good in that one movie  
Chocolate Rain!  
Makes best friends begin to fight and stuff  
Chocolate Rain!  
Yea! That's why I come here  
Chocolate Rain!  
Stays behind as colors celebrate  
Chocolate Rain!  
Get your cute ass to the gay parade  
Chocolate Rain!  
The same crime has a higher price to pay  
Chocolate Rain!  
There's no parking places in Grand Street  
Chocolate Rain!  
The judge and jury swear its not [?]  
Chocolate Rain!  
I got tin foil on my spokes again  
Chocolate Rain!  
Well I'm in another state and stuff  
Chocolate Rain!  
I don't have the lock for my bicycle  
Chocolate Rain!  
These scars on my...oh wait I'm reading the wrong song  
And behind my...  
Chocolate Rain!  
Chocolate Rain!  
Your Doing It fucking Wrong!

I got under the grip  
Between this modern hell  
I got the rejection letter in the mail and  
It was already ripped to shreds.  
Seasons in a ruin and  
This bitter pill is chased with blood.  
There's fire in my veins  
And it's pouring out like a flood  
  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
  
This diabolic state is gracing my existence  
Like a catastrophic baby  
Maybe maybe you're the chemical reaction  
I am the atom bomb  
I am the chosen one  
Toxin your reservoir  
And then return man to ape  
  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno  
Woah, Christian's inferno

Staring out of my window watching the cars go rolling by  
My friends are gone I've got nothing to do  
So I sit here patiently watching the clock tick so slowly  
Gotta get away or my brains will explode  
  
Give me something to do to kill some time  
Take me to that place that I call home  
Take away the strains of being lonely  
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road  
  
See the hills from afar standing on my beat up car  
The sun went down and the night fills the sky  
Now I feel like me once again as the train comes rolling in  
Smoked my boredom gone, slapped my brains up so high  
  
Give me something to do to kill some time  
Take me to that place that I call home  
Take away the strains of being lonely  
Take me to the tracks at Christie Road  
  
Mother, stay out of my way of that place we go  
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road  
Mother, stay out of my way of that place we go  
We'll always seem to find our way to Christie Road  
  
If there is one thing that I need that makes me feel complete  
So I go to Christie Road, it's home, it's home  
It's home, it's home, it's home

I don't know you but I think I hate you  
You're the reason for my misery  
Strange, how you've become my biggest enemy  
I have never even seen your face  
  
Maybe it's just jealousy  
Mixed up with a violent mind  
A circumstance that doesn't make much sense  
Or maybe I'm just dumb  
  
You're the cloud hanging out over my head  
Hail comes crashing down welting my face  
Magic man, egocentric plastic man  
Yet you still got one over on me

Today is the first day of the rest of our lives  
Tomorrow is too late to pretend  
Everything's all right  
I'm not getting any younger as long as you don't get any older  
I'm not going to state that yesterday never was  
  
Bloodshot deadbeat and lack of sleep  
Making your mascara bleed  
Tears down your face  
Leaving traces of mistakes  
  
If I promise to go to church on Sunday  
Will you go with me on Friday night?  
If you live with me, I'll die for you  
And this compromise  
  
I hereby solemnly swear to tell the whole truth  
And nothing but the truth is what I'll ever hear from you  
"Trust" is a dirty word that comes only from such a liar  
But "respect" is something I will earn...  
If you have faith

I don't wanna go back home  
I don't wanna kiss goodnight  
Let us paralyze this moment til it dies  
  
To the end of the earth  
Under the Valley of the Stars  
There's a car crashing deep inside my heart  
  
Take a ride through the avenues  
Across the Great Divide  
There's a siren screaming "I'm alive"  
It cries  
  
Red alert is the color  
Of your paper valentines  
Intertwined on this moment passing by  
  
Take a ride through the avenues  
Across the Great Divide  
There's a siren screaming "I'm alive"  
It cries  
  
Red alert is the color  
Of your paper valentines  
Intertwined on this moment passing by  
  
Do you wanna be my valentine?  
  
So come away with me tonight  
With cigarettes and valentines  
  
Cigarettes and valentines!

At the center of the earth  
In the parking lot  
Of the 7-11 were I was taught  
The motto was just a lie  
It says home is where your heart is  
But what a shame  
'Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same  
It's beating out of time  
City of the dead  
At the end of another lost highway  
Signs misleading to nowhere  
City of the damned  
Lost children with dirty faces today  
No one really seems to care  
I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall  
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall  
And so it seemed to confess  
It didn't say much but it only confirmed  
That the center of the earth is the end of the world  
And I could really care less  
City of the dead  
At the end of another lost highway  
Signs misleading to nowhere  
City of the damned  
Lost children with dirty faces today  
No one really seems to care, hey  

Song: Closing Time  
Artist(band): "Semisonic"  
Verse I  
Closing time, open all the doors and let you out into the world  
Closing time, turn all of the lights on over every boy and every girl  
Closing time, one last call for alcohol, so finish your whiskey or beer  
Closing time, you don't have to go home, but you can't stay here  
Chorus  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
Verse 2  
Closing time, time for you to go out to the places you will be from  
Closing time, this room won't be open till your brother's or your sister's
come  
So gather up your jackets, move it to the exits, I hope you have found a
friend.  
Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end, yeah  
Chorus  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
Bridge  
Closing time, time for you to go out to the places you will be from...  
Chorus  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
I know who I want to take me home  
Take me home.  
End  
Closing time, every new beginning comes from some other beginning's end...

Seventeen and strung out on confusion  
Trapped inside a roll of disillusion  
I found out what it takes to be a man  
Now mom and dad will never understand  
  
Secrets collecting dust but never forget  
Skeletons come to life in my closet  
I found out what it takes to be a man  
Now mom and dad will never understand  
What's happening to me  
  
Seventeen and coming clean for the first time  
I finally figured out myself for the first time  
I found out what it takes to be a man  
Now mom and dad will never understand  
What's happened to me

Wake up, The house is on fire  
And the cat's caught in the dryer  
Philosophy's a liar when your home is your headstone  
"Icon" is the last chance for hope  
When there's no such thing as heroes  
Your faith lies in the ditch that you dug yourself in  
  
Last chance to piss it all away  
Nothing but hell to pay  
When the lights are going down  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone  
  
Christmas lights in the middle of August  
Grudges come back to haunt us  
Your oldest allies are your long lost enemies  
Grounded in a duplex to find that you're living on a landmine  
Vacation hot spots is a cemetery drive  
  
Last chance to piss it all away  
Nothing but hell to pay  
When the lights are going down  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone  
  
Last chance to piss it all away  
Nothing but hell to pay when all you want to do is not give up  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone  
  
Deadbeat holiday celebrate your own decay  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
On a noose over your home  
  
Deadbeat holiday get on your knees and pray  
There's a vacant sign that's hanging high  
But at least you're not alone

I want to be your dominated  
Love slave  
I want to be the one that  
Takes the pain  
You can spank me when I do  
Not behave  
Mack me in the forehead  
With a chain  
  
Cause I love feelin' dirty  
And I love feelin' cheap  
And I love it when you hurt me  
So drive those staples deep  
  
I want you to slap me and  
Call me naughty  
Put a belt sander against my  
Skin  
I want to feel pain all over  
My body  
Can't wait to be punished for  
My sins.

Late last night I had a dream  
And she was in it again  
She and I were in the sky  
Flying hand in hand  
I woke up in a cold sweat  
Wishing she was by my side  
Praying that she'll dry tears  
Left on my face I've cried  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I love her  
Keep dreaming of her  
Will I understand  
If she wants to be my friend?  
  
I'll send a letter to that girl  
Asking her to be my own  
But my pen is writing wrong  
So I'll say it in a song  
Oh, I love you more right now  
More than I've ever loved before  
Here's those words straight from these lips  
I'll need you forever more  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Come ease the pain that's in my heart [Repeats]  
  
Late last night I had a dream  
And she was in it again  
She and I were in the sky  
Flying hand in hand  
I woke up in a cold sweat  
Wishing she was by my side  
Praying that she'll dry tears  
Left on my face I've cried  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Come ease the pain that's in my heart [Repeats]

Let's get drunk and go out driving  
Let's see just how quickly we can go  
Let's plowed and plow down some old lady  
Let's go drink off the stereo  
Let's go down and vomit out the window  
Let's keep score of how many we've killed  
Two tequila slammers off the dashboard  
There's an alcoholic at the wheel  
Careful when I'm taking this next corner  
Don't want anybody wasting beer  
Pass another lime and Corona  
Too drunk to use my butt for shifting gears  
Let's get drunk and go out driving  
Let's do donuts in the cul-de-sac  
Let's get drunk and go out driving  
Whirling and we're never coming back  
Whirling and we're never coming back  
Whirling and we're never coming back

And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care  
If nobody cares?  
  
And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care  
If nobody cares?  
  
Jesus filling out paper work now  
At the facility on East 12th St.  
He's not listening to a word now  
He's in his own world and he's daydreaming  
He'd rather be doing something else now  
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly  
His life's on the line with anxiety now  
And she had enough  
And he had plenty  
  
Somebody get me out of here  
Anybody get me out of here  
Somebody get me out of here  
Get me the fuck right out of here  
  
So far away  
I dont want to stay  
Get me outta here right now  
  
I just want to be free  
Is there a possibility?  
Get me out of here right now  
  
THIS LIFELIKE DREAM AINT FOR ME!

Raise your hands now to testify  
Your confession will be crucified  
You're a sacrificial suicide  
Like a dog that's been sodomized  
Stand up! All the white boys  
Sit down! And the black girls  
You're the soldiers of the new world  
  
Put your faith in a miracle  
And it's non-denominational  
Join the choir we will be singing  
In the church of wishful thinking  
  
A fire burns today  
Of blasphemy and genocide  
The sirens of decay  
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics  
  
Oh bless me Lord for I have sinned  
It's been a lifetime since I last confessed  
I threw my crutches in "the river of a shadow of doubt"  
And I'll be dressed up in my Sunday best  
  
Say a prayer for the family  
Drop a coin for humanity  
Ain't this uniform so flattering?  
I never asked you a god damned thing  
  
A fire burns today  
Of blasphemy and genocide  
The sirens of decay  
Will infiltrate the faith fanatics  
  
Don't test me  
Second guess me  
Protest me  
You will disappear  
  
I want to know who's allowed to breed  
All the dogs who never learned to read  
Missionary politicians  
And the cops of a new religion  
  
A fire burns today  
Of blasphemy and genocide  
The sirens of decay  
Will infiltrate the inside  
Yeah

I saw my friend the other day  
And I don't' know  
Exactly just what he became  
It goes to show  
It wasn't long ago  
And I was just like you  
And now I think I'm sick  
And I want to go home  
  
How have I been how have you been  
It's been so long  
What have you done with all your time  
And what went wrong  
I knew you back when  
And you, you knew me  
And now I think you're sick  
I want to go home  
  
Anybody ever say no?  
Ever tell you that you weren't right?  
Where did all the little kid go?  
Did you lose it in a hateful fight?  
And you know it's true

She's an extraordinary girl  
In an ordinary world  
And she can't seem to get away  
  
He lacks the courage in his mind  
Like a child left behind  
Like a pet left in the rain  
  
She's all alone again  
Wiping the tears from her eyes  
Some days he feels like dying  
She gets so sick of crying  
  
She sees the mirror of herself  
And image she wants to sell  
To anyone willing to buy  
  
He steals the image in her kiss  
From her hearts apocalypse  
From the one called whats her name  
  
She's all alone again  
Wiping the tears from her eyes  
Some days he feels like dying  
She gets so sick of crying  
  
She's all alone again  
Wiping the tears from her eyes  
Some days he feels like dying  
Some days he's not worth trying  
Now that they're both up on it  
She gets so sick of crying  
  
She's an extraordinary girl  
An extraordinary girl  
An extraordinary girl  
An extraordinary girl

I woke up in a pool of sweat  
At first I thought that I pissed the bed  
Honest stories in the midnight hour  
The kiss of death on the Eiffel Tower  
  
And I went down  
Like the speed of sound  
You're out of sight  
But not out of mind  
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true  
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you  
I'll spend the night living in denial  
Making paper planes just for a while  
I'll crash into you, crash into you  
If you crash in my imagination too  
  
Break a leg and you crush my heart  
I'm a mess and you're a work of art  
Got your blessings going 0 to 5  
Steal a kiss and I took a dive  
  
And I went down  
Like the speed of sound  
You're out of sight  
But not out of mind  
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true  
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck and I fell for you  
I'll spend the night living in denial  
Making paper planes just for a while  
I'll crash into you, crash into you  
If you crash in my imagination  
  
I had a dream that I kissed your lips and it felt so true  
Then I woke up as a nervous wreck  
And I fell for you  
And I fell for you  
And I fell for you

Something's on my mind  
It's been for quite some time  
This time I'm on to you  
  
So where's the other face  
The face I heard before  
Your head trip's boring me  
  
Let's nuke the bridge we torched 2,000 times before  
This time we'll blast it all to hell  
  
I've had this burning in my gut now for so long  
My belly's aching now to say  
  
Stuck down in a rut  
Of dislogic and smut  
A side of you well hid  
  
When it's all said and done  
It's real and it's been fun  
But was it all real fun?  
  
Let's nuke the bridge we torched 2,000 times before  
This time we'll blast it all to hell  
  
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long  
My belly's aching now to say  
  
To say  
Your just  
A fuck  
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck  
  
I'm taking pride  
In telling you to fuck off and die  
  
I've had this burning in my guts now for so long  
My belly's aching now to say  
  
I'm taking pleasure in announcing this to you  
So listen up 'cause you might miss  
  
Your just  
A fuck  
I can't explain it 'cause I think you suck  
  
I'm taking pride  
In telling you to fuck off and die  
  
Good night  
  
I was alone  
I was all by myself  
No one was looking  
I was thinking of you  
  
Oh yeah did I mention  
I was all by myself  
All by myself  
All by myself  
All by myself  
  
I went to your house  
But no one was there  
I went in your room  
I was all by myself  
  
I remember we had  
Such wonderful times  
When I'm all by myself  
All by myself

My name is Billie, And im freaking out  
I thought before I was  
And I can't get it figured out  
I sit alone with my thoughts and prayers  
Screaming my memories  
As if I was never there  
  
Standing at the edge of the world  
Its giving me the chills  
Looking down the edge of the world  
Lost in a tangle  
Its freaking me out  
Burning lights and Blackouts  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
Im like a punk rocker on labor day  
How the hell did I work so hard  
To be born this way?  
I never learned to read or write so well  
But I can play the guitar  
Until it hurts like hell  
  
Standing at the edge of the world  
Its giving me the chills  
Looking down the edge of the world  
Lost in a tangle  
Its freaking me out  
Burning lights and Blackouts  
  
From the edge of the world  
From the edge of the world  
  
If this is what you call the good life  
I want a better way to die  
If this is what you call the good life  
I want a better way to die  
  
Oh, I dont wanna think about tomorrow  
Dont wanna think about this road  
It doesnt matter anyway  
I wanna start a revolution  
I wanna hear it on my radio  
Ill put it off another day  
I want a new conspiricy  
And the silence of a thousand cries  
So hurry up  
I want a better way to die  
  
Im running late to Somewhere Now  
I dont want to be  
Where the future and promises  
Ain't what it used to be  
I never wanted to compromise  
Or bargain with my soul  
How did life on the wild side  
Ever get so full  
  
Somewhere now  
Dont wanna think about tomorrow  
Somewhere now  
Dont wanna think about the road  
Somewhere now  
Oh I wanna start a revolution  
Somewhere now  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)  
Don't wanna think about tomorrow!  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)  
Don't wanna think about the road  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)  
I wanna hear it on my radio, I'll put it on another day!  
(I a'int gonna stand in line no more!)

Slipping down a slide  
I did enjoy the ride  
Don't know what to decide  
You lied to me  
You looked me in the eye  
It took me by surprise  
Now are you gratified  
You cried to me  
La, la, la, la, la  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
When I was feeling down  
You'd start to hang around  
And then I found your hands all over me  
And that was out of bounds  
You filthy rotten hound  
It's better than it sounds, believe me  
La, la, la, la, la  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
Hey, you gotta get over it  
Hey, you gotta get over it  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
Don't turn around  
I'm sick and I'm tired of your face  
Don't make this worse  
You've already gone and got me mad  
It's too bad I'm not sad  
It's casting over  
It's just one of those things  
You'll have to get over it  
You'll have to get over it

Take away the sensation inside  
Bitter sweet migraine in my head  
Its like a throbbing tooth ache of the mind  
I can't take this feeling anymore  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling,  
The sensations overwhelming,  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright  
Tell me that I won't feel a thing  
So give me Novacaine  
  
Out of body and out of mind  
Kiss the demons out of my dreams  
I get the funny feeling, that's alright  
Jimmy says it's better than here,  
I'll tell you why  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling,  
The sensations overwhelming,  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright,  
Tell me that I won't feel a thing,  
So give me Novacaine  
  
Oh Novacaine  
  
Drain the pressure from the swelling,  
The sensations overwhelming  
Give me a long kiss goodnight and everything will be alright,  
Tell me Jimmy I won't feel a thing,  
So give me Novacaine

Here we go again, infatuation  
Touches me just when I  
Thought that it would end  
Oh but then again it seemed  
Much more than that but  
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking  
  
Well,I toss and turn all night  
Thinking of your ways of affection  
But to find that it's not different at all  
Well I throw away my past mistakes  
And contemplate my future  
That's when I say, what the hey  
  
Would it last forever?  
You and I together, hand and hand  
We run away, far away  
I'll beat that nasty weather  
But I'll take whatever you can  
Give that comes my way, yeah, far away  
  
Here we go again, infatuation  
Touches me just when I  
Thought that it would end  
Woah, then again it seemed  
Much more than that but  
I'm not sure exactly what you're thinking  
  
Well,I toss and turn all night  
Thinking of your ways of affection  
But to find that it's not different at all  
Well I throw away my past mistakes  
And contemplate my future  
That's when I say, what the hey  
  
Would it last forever?  
You and I together, hand and hand  
We run away, far away  
I'll beat that nasty weather  
But I'll take whatever you can  
Give that comes my way, yeah, far away  
  
Let's go fucking crazy  
  
Well,I toss and turn all night  
Thinking of your ways of affection  
But to find that it's not different at all  
Well I throw away my past mistakes  
And contemplate my future  
That's when I say, what the hey  
  
Would it last forever?  
You and I together, hand and hand  
We run away, far away  
I'll beat that nasty weather  
But I'll take whatever you can  
Give that comes my way, far away,  
Far away

Another turning point  
A fork stuck in the road  
Time grabs you by the wrist  
Directs you where to go  
  
So make the best of this test  
And don't ask why  
It's not a question,  
But a lesson learned in time  
  
It's something unpredictable,  
But in the end it's right  
I hope you had the time of your life  
  
So take the photographs  
And still-frames in your mind  
Hang it on a shelf  
And good health and good time  
  
Tattoo's of memories  
And dead skin on trial,  
For what it's worth  
It was worth all the while  
  
It's something unpredictable,  
But in the end it's right  
I hope you had the time of your life  
  
It's something unpredictable,  
But in the end it's right  
I hope you had the time of your life  
  
It's something unpredictable,  
But in the end it's right  
I hope you had the time of your life

He's at it again  
And he's gonna win  
Gonna take it for a hell ride anyway  
He's on your side  
Gonna throw you aside  
And let the vultures pick apart what's left  
Seems like everything was just a fraction of a second from being okay  
So run and hide 'cause we're all gonna die  
And let the vultures pick apart what's left  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
He's at it again  
He's at it again  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
He's at it again  
He's gonna win  
Gonna take it for a joyride anyway  
You're standing in line, better make up your mind  
And let the bastard pick apart what's left of you  
Seems like everything was just a fraction of a second from being a dream  
So run and hide 'cause we're all gonna die  
Let the government decide what's left  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
He's at it again  
He's at it again  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
Walk around I see  
Million possibilities  
Well I know  
Nowhere to go  
And I can't comprehend  
Things this real seems so pretend  
I know... I don't know  
But I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
I'll be back  
And it makes great television watching the world end  
I'll be back

A small cloud has fallen  
The white mist hits the ground  
My lungs comfort me with joy  
Vegging on one detail  
The rest just crowds around  
My eyes itch of burning red  
  
[Chorus]  
Picture sounds  
Of moving insects so surreal  
Lay around  
Looks like I found something new  
  
Laying in my bed  
I think I'm in left field  
I picture someone, I think it's you  
You're standing so darn close  
My body begins to swell  
Why does one plus one make two?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Laying in my bed  
I think I'm in left field  
I picture someone, I think it's you  
You're standing so darn close  
My body begins to swell  
Why does one plus one make two?  
  
Picture sounds  
Of moving insects so surreal  
Lay around

How do you get your sleep at night?  
How did you get your noose so tight?  
Like chewing on tinfoil, it's so much fun  
Gonna be dead before your gone  
  
Cause look how things have gotten  
And I'll be happy so I won't pretend  
And I'll be cheering that you're going down  
And I'll be laughing, I'll be laughing  
  
How many feelings can you steal?  
Gotta be part of your appeal  
I can see through you cause you're wearing thin  
Like chewing on tinfoil once again  
  
Ha ha you're dead  
And I'm so happy  
In loving memory  
Of your demise  
  
When your ship is going down  
I'll go out and paint the town  
Ha ha you're dead  
Ha ha you're dead  
Ha ha you're dead  
  
(ha ha ha)  
  
Ha ha you're dead  
The joke is over  
You were an asshole  
And now you're gone  
As your ship is going down  
I'll stand by and watch you drown  
  
Ha ha you're dead  
You're gonna be dead  
Just remember what I said  
Ha ha you're dead  
Ha ha you're dead  
Ha ha you're dead

Haushinka is a girl with a peculiar name.  
I met her on the eve of my birthday.  
Did she know, did she know, before she went away, does she know?  
But it's too damn late  
This girl has gone far away.  
Now she's gone.  
All I have now is a memory to date.  
A cheap hat and cigarettes, and a peculiar name.  
I didn't know, I didn't know, before she went away.  
I know now, I know now, and it's too damn late.  
Will she ever find her way?  
I'm too damn young to be too late, but am I?  
Yet again I'm kicking myself, and I'll be here in battle scars, waiting for
you.  
Waiting for you now.

I'm taking all you down with me  
Explosives duct taped to my spine  
Nothing's gonna change my mind  
I won't listen to anyone's last words  
There's nothing left for you to say  
Soon you'll be dead anyway  
  
Well, no one is getting out alive  
This time I've really lost my mind and I don't care  
So close your eyes and kiss yourself goodbye  
And think about the time you spent and what they've ment  
To me it's nothing  
  
I'm losing all my happiness  
The happiness you pinned on me  
Loneliness still comforts me  
My anger dwells inside of me  
I'm taking it all out on you  
And all the shit you put me through  
  
Do you ever think back to another time  
Did it bring you so down that you thought you lost your mind?  
Do you ever want to lead a long ways of destruction  
And mow down any bullshit that comforts you  
Do you ever build up all the small things in your head  
To make one problem that adds up to nothing

Love conquers every time  
When two hearts come to collide  
You're the card in my valentine  
And the candy hearts in my mind  
  
And true love is the rule  
And you're nobody's fool  
  
The ship's coming to the light  
And it was love at first sight  
Baby, babe, you're the light  
And the flame burns in my mind's eye  
  
When triumph bleeds into bliss  
And I knew it from the first kiss  
  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
  
When triumph bleeds into bliss  
And I knew it from the first kiss  
  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide.  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide.  
Tonight, hearts collide  
Hearts collide  
Hearts collide.

Hear the sound of the falling rain  
Coming down like an Armageddon flame (Hey!)  
A shame  
The ones who died without a name  
  
Hear the dogs howlin' out of key  
To a hymn called faith and misery (Hey!)  
And bleed, the company lost the war today  
  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
On holiday  
  
Hear the drum pounding out of time  
Another protester has crossed the line (Hey!)  
To find, the money's on the other side  
  
Can I get another Amen (Amen!)  
There's a flag wrapped around a score of men (Hey!)  
A gag, A plastic bag on a monument  
  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
On holiday  
  
"The representative from California has the floor"  
  
Sieg Heil to the president gasman  
Bombs away is your punishment  
Pulverize the Eiffel towers  
Who criticize your government  
Bang bang goes the broken glass and  
Kill all the fags that don't agree  
Trials by fire setting fire  
Is not a way that's meant for me  
Just cause  
Just cause  
Because we're outlaws yeah!  
  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
I beg to dream and differ from the hollow lies  
This is the dawning of the rest of our lives  
This is our lives on Holiday

My heart is beating from me  
I am standing all alone  
Please call me only if you are coming home  
Waste another year flies by  
Waste a night or two  
You taught me how to live  
In the streets of shame  
Where you've lost your dreams in the rain  
There's no sign of hope  
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope  
There's a glow of light  
The St. Jimmy is the spark in the night  
Bearing gifts and trust  
The fixture in the city of lust  
What the hells your name  
What's your pleasure and what's your pain?  
Do you dream too much?  
Do you think what you need is a crutch  
In the crowd of pain. St. Jimmy comes without any shame  
He says, "We're fucked up"  
And we're not the same  
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame  
  
Jimmy died today  
He blew out his brains into the bay  
In this state of mind, it's my own private suicide  
  
And nobody cares  
And nobody cares  
Does anyone care if nobody cares?  
Jesus is filling out paperwork now  
At the facility on east 12th st.  
He's not listening to a word now  
He's in his own world  
And he's daydreaming  
He'd rather be doing something else now,  
Like cigarettes and coffee with the underbelly,  
His life is on the line of anxiety now  
And he had enough  
And she had plenty  
Somebody get me out of here  
Anybody get me out of here  
Somebody get me out of here  
Get me the fuck right out of here  
So far away  
I don't want to stay  
Get me out of here right now  
I just want to be free  
Is there a possibility  
Get me out of here right now  
This life like dream ain't for me  
  
I fell asleep watching spike TV  
After ten cups of coffee  
And you're still not there  
Dreaming of a song  
When something went wrong  
And I can't tell anyone  
Cause no one's there  
Left me here alone  
When I should have stayed home  
After ten cups of coffee  
I'm thinking where'd you go  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you  
They're all out without you havin' fun  
Where'd you go  
I'm thinking weird you go  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you  
They're all out without you havin' fun  
Where'd you go  
  
Geez, ha  
  
I got a rock and roll band  
I got a rock and roll life  
I got a rock and roll girlfriend  
And another ex-wife  
I got a rock and roll house  
I got a rock and roll car  
I plat the shit out the drums  
And I can play the guitar  
I got a kid in New York  
I got a kid in the bay  
I haven't drank or smoked a thing  
In over twenty two days  
So get off my case, get off my case, off my case!  
  
Here they come marching down the street  
Like a desperation murmur of a heart beat  
Coming back from the edge of town  
Underneath their feet  
The time has come and its going nowhere  
Nobody ever said that life was fair now  
Go-carts and guns are treasures they will bear  
In the summer heat  
The world is spinning  
Around and around  
Out of control again  
From the 7-11 to the fear of breaking down  
So send my love a letter bomb  
And visit me in hell  
We're the ones going  
  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
  
I started fuckin' running  
Just as soon as my feet touched the ground  
We're back in the Barrio  
But to you and me, that's jingle town  
  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
Home  
We're coming home again  
  
Nobody likes you  
Everyone left you  
They're all out without you havin' fun

I'm not fucking around  
I think I'm coming out  
All the deceivers and cheaters  
I think we've got a bleeder right now  
Want you to slap me around  
Want you to knock me out  
Well, you missed me, kissed me  
Now you better kick me down  
  
Maybe you're the runner-up  
But the first one to lose the race  
Almost only really counts in  
Horseshoes and hand grenades  
  
I'm gonna burn it all down  
I'm gonna rip it out  
Well, everything you employ  
Was meant for me to destroy  
To the ground now  
So don't you fuck me around  
Because I'll shoot you down  
I'm gonna drink, fight, and fuck  
And pushing my luck  
All the time now  
  
Maybe you're the runner-up  
But the first one to lose the race  
Almost only really counts in  
Horseshoes and hand grenades  
  
Demolition, self-destruction  
What to annihilate  
The age-old contradiction  
Demolition, self-destruction  
What to annihilate  
The old age  
  
I'm not fucking around  
I think I'm coming out  
All the deceivers and cheaters  
I think we've got a bleeder right now  
I'm not fucking around  
G-L-O-R-I-A

[Verse:]  
I'm curious to know exactly how you are  
I keep my distance but that distance is too far  
It reassures me just to know that you're okay  
But I don't want you to go on needing me this way  
[Chorus:]  
(And I)  
Don't wanna know if you are lonely  
Don't wanna know if you are less than lonely  
Don't wanna know if you are lonely  
Don't wanna know, don't want to know  
[Verse 2:]  
The day you left me left me feeling oh so bad  
Still I'm not sure about all the doubts we had  
From the beginning we both knew it wouldn't last  
Decisions have been made, the die has been cast  
[Chorus:]  
[Bridge:]  
[Verse 3:]  
The phone is ringing and the clock says 4 am  
If it's your friends, well I don't wanna hear from them  
So leave your number and a message at the tone  
Or you can just go on and leave me here alone  
[Chorus:]

I saw daddy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the mistletoe  
Last night  
He didn't see me creep  
Down the stairs to have a peek  
[Mike screams "Oh GOD!"]  
He thought I was up in the bedroom fast asleep  
  
Then, I saw mommy kissing Santa Claus  
Underneath the Christmas tree last night  
There must be some mistake  
Was I really awake?  
I move in closer, but better look away  
  
[Mike and Billie make barfing noises]

I crossed the river  
Fell into the sea  
Where the non-believers  
Go beyond belief  
Then I scratched the surface  
In the mouth of hell  
Running out of service  
In the blood I fell  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I - I just want to see the light  
And I - I don't want to lose my sight  
Well I - I just want to see the light  
And I need to know what's worth the fight  
  
I've been wasted  
Pills and alcohol  
I've been chasing  
Down the pool halls  
Then I drank the water  
From a hurricane  
And I set a fire  
Just to see the flame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I crossed the desert  
Reaching higher ground  
Then I pound the pavement  
To take the liars down  
But it's gone forever  
But never too late  
Where the ever-after  
Is in the hands of fate  
  
[Chorus]

All brawn and no brains  
And all those nice things  
And you finally got what you want  
Someone to look good with  
And light your cigarette  
Is this what you really want?  
  
I figured out what you're all about  
And I don't think I like what I see so  
I hope I won't be there in the end  
if you come around  
  
How long will he last  
Before he's a creep in the past  
And you're alone once again?  
Will you pop up again  
And be my special friend  
'Till the end?  
And when will that be?  
  
I figured out what you're all about  
And I don't think I like what I see  
I hope I won't be there in the end  
if you come around  
  
I figured out what you're all about  
And I don't think I like what I see so  
I hope I won't be there in the end  
if you come around

To know you is to hate you  
So loving you must be like suicide  
I don't mind if you don't mind  
I'm not the one that's going to die  
I guess I just can't listen  
To this one sided conversation again  
'Cause I don't care if you don't care  
No one ever said that life is fair  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And you're always cracking the same old lines again  
You're well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
The center of attention  
Got an honorable mention once again  
Congratulations and salutations  
You're a figment of your own imagination  
  
Everybody loves a joke  
But no one likes a fool  
And you're always cracking the same old lines again  
You're well rehearsed on every verse  
And that was stated clear  
But no one understands your verity  
  
To know you is to bait you  
And you fell victim to your own denial  
I don't mind if you don't mind  
If you're wasting all your time

Somebody keep my balance  
I think I'm falling off  
Into a state of regression  
The expiration date  
Rapidly coming up  
It's leaving me behind to rank  
Always move forward  
Going "straight" will get you nowhere  
There is no progress  
Evolution killed it all  
I found my place in nowhere  
I'm taking one step sideways  
Leading with my crutch  
Got a fucked up equilibrium  
Count down from nine to five  
Hooray! We're gonna die!  
Blessed into our extinction

My friend drove off the other day,  
And now he's gone and all they say,  
Is you gotta live cause life goes on  
But now I see I'm mortal too  
I can't live my life like you  
Gotta live it up while life goes on  
  
And I think it's alright  
That I do what I like cause that's the way I wanna live  
And so I give  
And I'm still giving  
  
And now I wonder about my friend  
If he gave all he could give  
Cause he lived his life like I live mine  
If you could see inside my head  
Then you'd start to understand  
The things I value in my heart  
  
You know that,  
I know that,  
You're watching me.  
  
Gotta make a plan  
Gotta do what's right  
Can't run around in circles if you wanna build a life  
And I don't wanna make a plan for a day far away  
While I'm young and while I'm able all I wanna do is....

I'm the son of rage and love  
The Jesus of Suburbia  
The bible of none of the above  
On a steady diet of  
Soda Pop and Ritalin  
No one ever died for my  
Sins in hell  
As far as I can tell  
At least the ones that I got away with  
  
And there's nothing wrong with me  
This is how I'm supposed to be  
In a land of make believe  
That don't believe in me  
  
Get my television fix  
Sitting on my crucifix  
The living room in my private womb  
While the Moms and brats are away  
To fall in love and fall in debt  
To alcohol and cigarettes  
And Mary Jane  
To keep me insane  
Doing someone else's cocaine  
  
And there's nothing wrong with me  
This is how I'm supposed to be  
In a land of make believe  
That don't believe in me  
  
At the center of the earth  
In the parking lot  
Of the 7-11 where I was taught  
The motto was just a lie  
  
It says home is where your heart is  
But what a shame  
Cause everyone's heart  
Doesn't beat the same  
It's beating out of time  
  
City of the dead  
At the end of another lost highway  
Signs misleading to nowhere  
City of the damned  
Lost children with dirty faces today  
No one really seems to care  
  
I read the graffiti  
In the bathroom stall  
Like the holy scriptures of a shopping mall  
And so it seemed to confess  
  
It didn't say much  
But it only confirmed that  
The center of the earth  
Is the end of the world  
And I could really care less  
  
City of the dead  
At the end of another lost highway  
Signs misleading to nowhere  
City of the damned  
Lost children with dirty faces today  
No one really seems to care  
  
I don't care if you don't  
I don't care if you don't  
I don't care if you don't care  
  
I don't care  
  
Everyone's so full of shit  
Born and raised by hypocrites  
Hearts recycled but never saved  
From the cradle to the grave  
We are the kids of war and peace  
From Anaheim to the Middle East  
We are the stories and disciples of  
The Jesus of suburbia  
  
Land of make believe  
And it don't believe in me  
Land of make believe  
And I don't believe  
And I don't care!  
  
Dearly beloved are you listening?  
I can't remember a word that you were saying  
Are we demented or am I disturbed?  
The space that's in between insane and insecure  
  
Oh therapy, can you please fill the void?  
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed  
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused  
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse  
  
To live, and not to breathe  
Is to die, in tragedy  
To run, to run away  
To find, what you believe  
  
And I leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
I lost my faith to this  
This town that don't exist  
So I run, I run away  
To the lights of masochists  
  
And I, leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
And I, walked this line  
A million and one fucking times  
But not this time  
  
I don't feel any shame  
I wont apologize  
When there ain't nowhere you can go  
Running away from pain  
When you've been victimized  
Tales from another broken home  
  
Oh you're leaving  
You're leaving  
You're leaving  
Are you leaving home?

I fucked up again it's all my fault.  
So turn me around and face the wall.  
Read me my rights and tell me I'm wrong.  
Until it gets into my thick skull.  
A slap on the wrist.  
A stab in the back.  
Torture me, I've been a bad boy.  
Nail me to the cross until you have won.  
I lost before I did any wrong.  
I'm hexed with regrets and bad luck.  
Keep you distance 'cause it's rubbing off.  
Or you will be damned to spend your life in hell.  
Or earth with me tangled at your feet.  
You finally met you nemesis disguised as your fatal long lost love.  
So kiss it good bye  
Until death do we part.  
You fell for a jinx for crying out loud.  
I'm a curse hanging around you in the end

Way Back Up In The Woods Among The Evergreens...  
  
There Stood A Log Cabin Made Of Earth And Wood,  
  
Where Lived A Country Boy Name Of Johnny B. Goode...  
  
He Never Ever Learned To Read Or Write So Well,  
  
But He Could Play The Guitar Like Ringing A Bell.  
  
  
  
Go Go  
  
Go Johnny Go  
  
Go Go  
  
Johny Be Good  
  
  
  
He Use To Carry His Guitar In A Gunny Sack  
  
And Sit Beneath The Trees By The Railroad Track.  
  
Oh, The Engineers Used To See Him Sitting In The Shade,  
  
Playing To The Rhythm That The Drivers Made.  
  
People Passing By Would Stop And Say  
  
Oh My That Little Country Boy Could Play  
  
  
  
Go Go  
  
Go Johnny Go  
  
Go Go  
  
Johny Be Good  
  
  
  
His Mama Told Him Someday He Would Be A Man,  
  
And He Would Be The Leader Of A Big Old Band.  
  
Many People Coming From Miles Around  
  
To Hear Him Play His Music When The Sun Go Down  
  
Maybe Someday His Name Would Be In Lights  
  
Saying Johnny B. Goode Tonight.

Walkin' after dark  
In the New York City park  
Your thoughts are so unholy  
In the holiness of old  
On with Christian soldiers  
Filled with jivin' mind control  
  
The blood left on the dance floor  
Runnin', runnin' red  
The bullet that you asked for  
Killin' you to death  
Unless you  
  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Voices in my head are sayin'  
"Shoot that fucker down"  
  
We are the vultures  
The dirtiest kind  
We'll cut you once  
In your heart and your mind  
  
Walkin' after dark  
In the New York City park  
I'll pick up what's left in the club  
My pocket full of pills  
Sodom and Gomorrah  
In the century of thrills  
The blood left on the dance floor  
Runnin', runnin' red  
The bullet that you asked for  
Killin' you to death  
Unless you  
  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Hold him underwater  
'Till the motherfucker drowns  
  
We are the vultures  
The dirtiest kind  
We'll cut you once  
In your heart and your mind  
Someone's gonna get you boy  
Shoot that fucker down  
  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Shoot that fucker down  
  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Someone kill the DJ, shoot the fucking DJ  
Voices in my head are sayin'  
"Shoot that fucker down"

Started at the age of four  
My mother went to the grocery store  
Went sneaking through her bedroom door  
To find something in a size four  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me  
  
My daddy threw me in therapy  
He thinks I'm not a real man  
Who put the drag in the drag queen  
Don't knock it until you tried it  
  
Sugar and spice and everything nice  
Wasn't made for only girls  
GI Joe in panty hose is making room  
For the one and only  
  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
King for a day in a leather thong  
King for a day, princess by dawn  
Just wait 'til all the guys get a load of me

Well, gotta know the enemy

Violence is an energy  
Against the enemy  
Violence is an energy  
  
Bringing on the fury  
The choir infantry  
Revolt against the honor to obey  
  
Overthrow the effigy  
The vast majority  
While burning down the foreman of control  
  
Silence is an enemy  
Against your urgency  
So rally up the demons of your soul  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
Do you know the enemy?  
Do you know your enemy?  
Well, gotta know the enemy  
  
The insurgency will rise  
When the blood's been sacrificed  
Don't be blinded by the lies  
In your eyes  
  
Violence is an energy  
From here to eternity  
Violence is an energy  
Silence is an enemy  
So gimme gimme revolution

Against your urgency  
So rally up the demons of your soul

I know that things are getting tougher  
When you can't get the top off from  
The bottom of the barrel  
Wide open road of my future now  
It's looking fucking narrow  
  
All I know is that I don't know nothing  
We get told to decide  
Just like as if I'm not going to change my mind  
  
All I know is that I don't know nothing  
Whatcha gonna do with yourself?  
Boy, better make up your mind  
  
Whatcha gonna do with yourself, boy?  
You're running out of time  
  
This time I got it all figured out  
All I know is that I don't know nothing  
And that's fine

Well I met girl named Lady Cobra  
Her black heart beats screams sinning clover  
She gives me chills and fever blisters  
She's serving spells and voodoo shakes  
  
She just wants to get me high  
Stick a needle in my eye  
Reeks like a loss to temptation,  
Living on my inner demons  
  
I don't wanna suicide,  
I don't want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
  
Cuddle up with me real tight  
Talk to me by candlelight  
Do you wanna play a game of twister  
Like a dirty old man with a babysitter  
  
I don't wanna suicide,  
I don't want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
  
I don't wanna make you cry  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Drawin' blood and lonely stars  
Drink and kiss for cheap guitars  
  
I don't wanna suicide,  
I don't want this to end  
I just wanna be your friend  
Ah, your friend

I text a postcard, sent to you  
Did it go through?  
Sending all my love to you  
You are the moonlight of my life every night  
Giving all my love to you  
My beating heart belongs to you  
I walked for miles 'til I found you  
I'm here to honor you  
If I lose everything in the fire  
I'm sending all my love to you  
  
With every breath that I am worth  
Here on Earth  
I'm sending all my love to you  
So if you dare to second guess  
You can rest assure  
That all my love's for you  
  
My beating heart belongs to you  
I walked for miles 'til l found you  
I'm here to honor you  
If I lose everything in the fire  
I'm sending all my love to you  
  
My beating heart belongs to you  
I walked for miles 'til I found you  
I'm here to honor you  
If I lose everything in the fire  
Did I ever make it through

She puts her makeup on  
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland  
She's got her little book of conspiracies  
Right in her hand  
She is paranoid like  
Endangered species headed into extinction  
She is one of a kind  
She's the last of the American girls  
  
She wears her overcoat  
For the coming of the nuclear winter  
She is riding her bike  
Like a fugitive of critical mass  
She's on a hunger strike  
For the ones who won't make it for dinner  
She makes enough to survive  
For a holiday of working class  
  
She's a runaway of the establishment incorporated.  
She won't cooperate  
She's the last of the American girls  
  
She plays her vinyl records  
Singing songs on the eve of destruction  
She's a sucker for  
All the criminals breaking the laws  
She will come in first  
For the end of western civilization  
She's an endless war  
She's a hero for a lost cause  
Like a hurricane  
In the heart of the devastation  
She's a natural disaster  
She's the last of the American girls  
  
She puts her makeup on  
Like graffiti on the walls of the heartland  
She's got her little book of conspiracies  
Right in her hand  
She will come in first  
For the end of western civilization  
She's a natural disaster  
She's the last of the American girls

Yeah, we say making changes  
Starts in the little things you do  
"Revolution begins at home"  
But for most of us it ends there, too  
We're doing something  
We're making changes  
Like changing the brand of crap we buy  
We say it makes a difference  
But that's just another lie  
It used to be us and them  
And you and me  
And now we can't reach our potential  
Without a common enemy  
A real war to fight against  
Instead of our petty disagreements  
But how can I rationalize  
My life during wartime lie  
A call to action and a reaction  
Taking our lives in our own hands  
Instead of sitting around and talking  
About the same old shitty bands  
But war is going on right now  
And I'm not doing anything about it  
Without a crowd I'm not so loud  
I can't do anything by myself  
But that's just another lie

Suck my dick until your lips fall off.  
Don't make me ask again please.  
Put it down your throat until it makes you cough.  
Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese.  
  
Well you're from the south your a special kind of girl.  
Put my nuts in your mouth just like you was a squirrel.  
Work on the shaft, cradle on the balls.  
Baby just don't bite it, get it on get it on.  
  
Suck my dick until your lips fall off.  
Don't make me ask again please.  
Put it down your throat until it makes you cough.  
Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese.  
  
Well why don't you go down and a hook a brother up?  
Swallow it on down or spit it in a cup.  
Wipe it on your t-shirt let it dribble down your chin.  
Smoke a couple Newports and suck that dick again.  
  
Suck my dick until your lips fall off.  
Don't make me ask again please.  
Put it down your throat until it makes you cough.  
Nibble on my dick like a rat does cheese.

Where did you come from?  
Where have you been?  
Looks like you fell into the trash bin  
I'm catching train, I'm crashing a car  
Back in for daylight shooting for the stars  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train  
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
Don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
  
Serious people are funny to me  
Funny people seem so serious  
  
I'm always lost and nothing will change  
Give me directions and I'll get lost again  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train  
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
  
Don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
  
Like a lifelong daisy chain  
Of my imagination  
A rat inside a maze  
I got no destination  
  
'Cause I'm a little boy named Train  
Ask me again, I'll tell you the same  
Little boy named Train  
  
I don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been  
I said I don't know where I come from  
But I know where I have been

I sit around and watch the tube but, nothing's on  
I change the channels for an hour or two  
Twiddle my thumbs just for a bit  
I'm sick of all the same old shit  
In a house with unlocked doors  
And I'm fucking lazy  
  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Take me away to paradise  
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind!!!  
And I smell like shit  
  
Peel me off this Velcro seat and get me moving  
I sure as hell can't do it by myself  
I'm feeling like a dog in heat  
Barred indoors from the summer street  
I locked the door to my own cell  
And I lost the key  
  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Take me away to paradise  
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind!!!  
And I smell like shit  
  
I got no motivation  
Where is my motivation  
No time for motivation  
Smoking my inspiration  
  
I sit around and watch the phone, but no one's calling  
Call me pathetic, call me what you will  
My mother says to get a job  
But she don't like the one she's got  
When masturbation's lost its fun  
You're fucking lonely  
  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Take me away to paradise  
I'm so damn bored, I'm going blind  
And loneliness has to suffice  
Bite my lip and close my eyes  
Slipping away to paradise  
Some say, "Quit or I'll go blind"  
But it's just a myth

I'm taking down all my enemies 'cause they're all so fucking useless  
A bunch of shit talking drama queens and they're all filled with excuses  
I wanna find me a better scene where it's not the same opinion  
I'd rather go to a funeral than to this high school reunion  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But now you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing bastard crime  
But you're a stupid mother fucker and you're doing your time 'cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control  
  
Hanging out all by myself, at least I make good company  
Hey, isn't that a whatshisface that I see walking down the street  
I'm gonna hide in the shadows 'cause I really got nothing to say  
We never had anything in common and I never liked you anyway  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love  
But when you're sucking on a door knob that I slammed in your face  
Life's a cruel crushing son of a bitch  
And you're a stupid mother fucker serve your shit to the pigs cause  
  
We're all crazy, you're all crazy now  
Well we're so crazy, you've all gone insane  
Loss of control, loss of control  
  
April Fool thought you're falling in love

Today's the Macy's Day parade  
The night of the living dead is on its way  
With a credit report for duty call  
It's a lifetime guarantee  
Stuffed in a coffin ten percent more free  
Red-light special at the mausoleum  
  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed to you  
What's the consolation prize?  
Economy sized dreams of hope  
  
When I was a kid I thought  
I wanted all the things that I haven't got  
Oh, I learned the hardest way  
Then I realized what it took  
To tell the difference between  
Thieves and crooks  
Lesson learned to me and you  
  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Because I'm thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one I've never known  
Cause now I know  
It's all that I wanted  
  
What's the consolation prize?  
Economy sized dreams of hope  
Give me something that I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Because I'm thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one I've never known  
And where it goes  
And I'm thinking about  
The only road  
The one I've never known  
And where it goes  
  
Because I'm thinking about  
A brand new hope  
The one I've never known  
Cause now I know  
It's all that I wanted

Hey, you got yourself a pretty little blouse  
I think I wanna rub it the wrong way  
Do you wanna spin a bottle, play a game of chicken?  
Well, it's a tongue twister till your lips are bleeding  
  
Oh, anyhow, anywhere  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
  
Oh, you're so precious, you're a fucking delinquent  
Well I got myself jonesin' and I need some fixin'  
It's a makeout party on another dimension  
And it's gonna get crowded with some bad intensions  
  
Oh, anyhow, anywhere  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there

Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
Oh, scream and shout, truth or dare  
Kiss me there, oh kiss me there  
  
Oh kiss me there  
Kiss me there

She smashed the radio with the board of education  
Turn up the static left of the state of the nation  
  
Turn up the flame, step on the gas  
Burning the flag at half mast  
She's a rebel's forgotten son  
An export of the revolution  
  
She is the first voice of the last ones in line  
She'll drag the lake to keep the vendetta alive  
  
Bring in the head of the government  
The dog ate the document  
Somebody shot the president  
And no one knows where Maria went?  
  
Maria, Maria, Maria,  
Where did you go?  
  
Be careful what you're offering  
Your breath lacks the conviction  
Drawing the line in the dirt  
Because the last decision  
...is no.

Sing us a song of the century  
  
That sings like american eulogy  
  
The damn of my love and conspiracy  
  
Of forgotten hope and class of 13  
  
Tell me a story into that goodnight  
  
Sing us a song for me  
  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
  
Red alert is the color of panic  
Elevated to the point of static  
Beating into the hearts of the fanatics  
And the neighborhood's a loaded gun  
Idle thought leads to full-throttle screaming  
And welfare is asphyxiating  
Mass confusion is all the new rage  
And it's creating a feeding ground  
For the bottom feeders of hysteria  
  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
  
True sounds of maniacal laughters  
And the deaf-mute is misleading the choir  
The punch line is a natural disaster  
And it's sung by the unemployed  
Fight fire with a riot  
The class war is hanging on a wire  
Because the martyr is a compulsive liar  
When he said  
"it's just a bunch of niggers throwing gas into the hysteria"  
  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
Mass hysteria  
  
There's a disturbance on the oceanside  
They tapped into the reserve  
The static response is so unclear now  
Mayday this is not a test!  
As the neighborhood burns, America is falling  
Vigilantes warning you  
Calling Christian and Gloria

Sittin' on the hood of a camaro  
Walkin' shooting stars across the earth  
Counting all the bites from the mosquitoes  
There goes my Minnesota girl  
Lazy days  
Gone without notice  
In a daze... With faraway eyes  
Driving to a closed spot Wednesday afternoon  
There goes my Minnesota girl  
In a daze  
Go without notice  
Lazy days.... With faraway eyes  
Countin' from the pieces we have been through  
Here comes my Minnesota girl  
There goes my Minnesota girl

[Chorus]  
I want to be the minority  
I don't need your authority  
Down with the moral majority  
Cause I want to be the minority  
  
I pledge allegiance to the underworld  
One nation under dog  
There of which I stand alone  
A face in the crowd  
Unsung, against the mold  
Without a doubt,  
Singled out  
The only way I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stepped out of the line  
Like a sheep runs from the herd  
Marching out of time  
To my own beat now  
The only way I know  
One light, one mind  
Flashing in the dark  
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts  
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me  
A free for all  
Fuck 'em all  
"You're on your own side"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One light, one mind  
Flashing in the dark  
Blinded by the silence of a thousand broken hearts  
"For crying out loud" she screamed unto me  
A free for all  
Fuck 'em all  
"You're on your own side"  
  
[Chorus]

Virginia was a "lot lizard" from F.L.A.  
She had a compound fracture in the "trunk"  
It started when she ran away  
Thumbs out on the interstate  
She hitched a ride to misery  
  
"Mr. Whirly" had a catastrophic incident  
He fell into a city by the bay  
He liquidated his estate  
Now he sleeps upon the Height  
Panhandling misery  
  
He's gonna get high high high  
When he's low low low  
The fire burns from better days  
And she screams why oh why  
I said I don't know  
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday  
Of misery  
  
Vinnie was a hustler out of Amsterdam  
He ran the drug cartel in "Tinseltown"  
They found him in a Cadillac  
Bludgeoned with a baseball bat in the name  
Of misery  
  
Gina hit the road to new york city  
Mysteriously the night Vinnie croaked  
She stopped in Vegas to elope  
With Virgina and the dope  
And kissed the bride eternally  
  
They're gonna get high high high  
When they're low low low  
The fire burns from better days  
And she screams why oh why  
I said I don't know  
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday  
Of misery  
  
Hell hounds on your trail now once again, boy  
Its groping on your leg until it sleeps  
The emptiness will fill your soul with sorrow  
Because its not what you make, its what you leave  
  
And we're gonna get high high high  
When we're low low low  
The fire burns from better days  
And she screams why oh why  
I said I don't know  
The catastrophic hymns from yesterday  
Of misery

Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the murder city  
  
I'm wide awake  
After the riot  
This demonstration  
Of our anguish  
This empty laughter  
Has no reason  
Like a bottle  
Of your favorite poison  
  
We are the last call  
And it's too pathetic  
  
Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the murder city  
  
Christian's crying  
In the bathroom  
And I just want to  
Bum a cigarette  
We've come so far,  
We've been so wasted  
It's written  
All over our faces  
  
We are the last call  
And it's too pathetic  
  
Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the murder city  
  
Desperate  
But not hopeless  
I feel so useless  
In the murder city  
Desperate  
But not helpless  
The clock strikes midnight  
In the.

Well, people try to put us down.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
Just because we get around.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
The things they do look awful cold.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
I hope I die before I get old.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
My generation.  
Why don't you all just fade away?  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
And don't try to dig what we all say.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
I'm just talkin' bout my generation.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
My generation.  
Break it, fuck that shit!  
Why don't you all just fade away?  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
And don't try to dig what we all say.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
I'm not trying to cause a big sensation.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
I'm just talkin' bout my generation.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
My generation.  
Talkin' bout my generation.  
This is my generation.  
This is my generation, baby.

Nice guys finish last  
You're running out of gas  
Your sympathy will get you left behind  
Sometimes you're at your best  
When you feel the worst  
You feel washed up like piss gone down the drain  
  
Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane  
I'm so fucking happy I could cry  
Every joke can have it's truth but now the joke's on you  
I never knew you're such a funny guy  
  
Oh nice guys finish last  
When you are the outcast  
Don't pat yourself on the back  
You might break your spine  
  
Living on command  
You're shaking lots of hands  
You're kissing up and bleeding all your trust  
Taking what you need  
Bite the hand that feeds  
You lose your memory and you've got no shame  
  
Pressure cooker pick my brain and tell me I'm insane  
I'm so fucking happy I could cry  
Every joke can have it's truth but now the joke's on you  
I never knew you're such a funny guy  
  
Oh nice guys finish last  
When you are the outcast  
Don't pat yourself on the back

Taking a ride to my old haunt  
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite color's candy apple, girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
What's that I hear? You wanna go for a ride?  
Don't be afraid, boy, to come inside  
I got the thing that you want, the fix that you need  
Chase this with a little lust and greed  
I'll be the devil on your shoulder saying, hey boy, come on  
My black heart beats crimson and clover?  
Operator, operator patch my boy in  
This is nightlife and I'll get under your skin  
  
Taking a ride to my old haunt  
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite color's candy apple, girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
What a thrill, heart beats fast  
Sounds like love but you know it won't last  
Cheap champagne stain on an even cheaper suit  
Hope there's more in your pants than a bus route  
Red velvet walls  
Line the sugar-coated halls  
Girls on your bar stools from late last calls  
This town is filled with snakes, mistakes and whiskey shakes  
It's too late I already cut the brakes  
  
I'm rollin', strollin' into town  
Is it me or am I going crazy?  
This dirty city is my sugar town  
My little angel of death is my nightlife  
  
You better make a move before I get bored  
If you wanna explore my vocal chord  
Leave the girl a go-go dance in the cooch  
One hand on my knee one hand on the hooch  
Why don't you stick around for one more round?  
This place is a circus and I know you'll be my clown  
'Cause I'm a ring leader  
I run the show  
And only when I tell ya  
Will it be time to go  
  
Taking a ride to my old haunt  
She's in my blood, I reside in my nightlife  
My favorite color's candy apple, girl  
And she resides in my mind and my nightlife  
  
(Hey boy) She is my night life  
(hey boy) She is my night life  
(Haha hey boy) She is my night life  
(See you later) She is my night life

Why should my fun have to end?  
For me it's only the beginning  
I see my friends begin to age  
A short countdown to their end  
  
Call me irresponsible  
Call me habitual  
But when you think of me  
Do you fill your head with schemes  
Better think again  
Cause no one knows  
  
I don't want to cause no harm  
But sometimes my actions hurt  
Is there something I should find  
To make plans for forever  
Does it seem like all your memories fade  
You soak up knowledge to fill the space  
And still my answer remains...  
I don't know.

I'm just a mutt  
And nowhere is my home  
Where dignity's a land mine  
In the school of lost hope  
I've panhandled for a life because  
I'm not afraid to beg  
Hand me down your lost and founds  
Of second hand regret  
You better swallow your pride  
Or you're gonna choke on it  
You better digest your values  
Because they turn to shit  
Honor's gonna knock you down  
Before your chance to stand up and fight  
I know I'm not the one  
I got no pride  
Sects of disconnection  
And traditions of lost faith  
No culture's worth a stream of piss  
Or a bullet in my face  
To hell with unity  
Separation's gonna kill us all  
Torn to shreds and disjointed  
Before the final fall

I'm tired of being what you want me to be  
Feeling so faithless lost under the surface  
Don't know what you're expecting of me  
Put under the pressure of walking in your shoes  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
I've become so tired so much more aware  
I've becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
Can't you see that you're smothering me  
Holding too tightly afraid to lose control  
Cause everything that you thought I would be  
Has fallen apart right in front of you  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
Every step that I take is another mistake to you  
(caught in the undertone just caught in the undertone)  
And every second I waste is more than I can take  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
I've become so tired so much more aware  
I've becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
And I know  
I may end up failing too  
But I know  
You were just like me with someone disappointed in you  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
I've become so tired so much more aware  
I've becoming this all I want to do  
Is be more like me and be less like you  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
Is everything what you want me to be  
I've become so numb I can't feel you there  
Is everything what you want me to be

Oh love, oh love  
Won't you rain on me tonight?  
Oh life, oh life  
Please don't pass me by  
Don't stop, don't stop  
Don't stop when the red lights flash  
Oh ride, free ride  
Won't you take me close to you  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
I'm wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my heart's on the loose  
  
Oh lights and action  
I just can't be satisfied  
Oh losers and choosers  
Won't you please hold on my life  
Oh hours and hours  
Like the dog years of the day  
Old story, same old story  
Won't you see the light of day  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
I'm wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my heart's on the loose  
  
Talk myself out of feeling  
Talk my way out of control  
Talk myself out of falling in love  
Falling in love with you  
  
Oh love, oh love  
Won't your rain on me tonight  
Oh ride, free ride  
Won't you take me close to you  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
I'm wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my heart's on the loose  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
I'm wearing my heart on a noose  
  
Far away, far away  
Waste away tonight  
Tonight my heart's on the loose  
  
Tonight my heart's on the loose  
Tonight my heart's on the loose

Juliet's trying to find out what she wants,  
But she don't know  
Experience has got her down  
Look this direction, I know it's not perfection,  
It's just me  
I want to bring you up again now!  
  
I'm losing what's left of my dignity  
A small price to I'll pay to see that you're happy  
Forget all the disappointments you have faced  
Open up your worried world and let me in  
  
Juliet's crying, cause now she's realizing,  
Love can be, filled with pain and distrust.  
I know I am crazy, and a bit lazy  
But I will try to bring you up again some how!

When I was younger  
I thought the world circled around me  
But in time I realized I was wrong  
My immortal thoughts turned into just dreams of a dead future  
It was a tragic case of my reality  
  
Do you think you're indestructible  
And no one can touch you?  
Well I think you're disposable  
And it's time you knew the truth  
Cause it's just one of my lies!  
  
Why does my life have to be so small?  
Yet death is forever  
And does forever have a life to call its own?  
  
Don't give me an answer cause you  
Only know as much as I know  
Unless you've been there once  
well I hardly think so  
  
I used to pray all night  
Before I lay myself down  
My mother said it was right  
Her mother said it too...  
Why?

I wish I could tell you  
But the words would come out wrong  
Oh, if you only knew  
The way I felt for so long  
I know that we're worlds apart  
But I just don't seem to care  
These feelings in my heart  
Only with you I want to share  
  
The first time I caught a glimpse of you  
Then my thoughts were only of you  
  
I hope that when time goes by  
You will think the same about me  
Many nights awake I lie  
I only wish that you could see  
I know that we're only friends  
I hope this feeling never ends  
If I could only hold you  
It's the only thing I want to do  
  
The first time I caught a glimpse of you  
Then my thoughts were only of you

[Verse 1]  
Where can I find the city of shining light,  
In an ordinary world?  
How can I leave a buried treasure behind,  
In an ordinary world?  
The days into years roll by,  
It's where that I live until I die,  
Ordinary world.  
  
[Verse 2]  
What would you wish if you saw a shooting star,  
In an ordinary world?  
I've walked to the end of the earth and afar,  
In an ordinary world.  
Baby, I don't have much,  
But what we have is more than enough,  
Ordinary world.  
  
[Verse 3]  
Where can I find the city of shining light?  
In an ordinary world.  
How can I leave a buried treasure behind?  
In an ordinary world.  
Baby, I don't have much,  
But what we have is more than enough,  
Ordinary world.

[Verse 1]  
Life after youth  
Faded in twilight  
The dawn of a criminal in bloom  
First love  
First forgiveness  
We were delinquants  
Freaks of a faded memory  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Outlaws, When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws of redemption, baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
We're Outlaws of forever, baby  
[Verse 2]  
Scars, broken hearts  
Breaking in cars  
Running in the light of the moon  
Lost souls  
Bottle rockets  
All that we wanted  
It's for our lives beyond stars  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Outlaws, When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws of redemption, baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
We're Outlaws of forever, baby  
  
[Bridge]  
I've got no supervision  
Nothing will change my spirits  
Race around with my innocence  
I'll plead my innocence  
But thats my best defense  
When you are young  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Outlaws, When we were forever young  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws of redemption, baby  
Hooligans  
We destroyed suburbia  
When we were outlaws  
We're outlaws all forever  
  
[Outro]  
I found a knife by the railroad track  
You took a train and you can't go back  
Forever now, forever now you'll roam

I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
Everything you know  
Everything you know  
It disturbs me so  
Everybody tried to push me  
Push me around  
Everybody tried to put me  
Try to put me down  
All messed up, hey everyone  
I've already had all my fun  
More troubles are gonna come  
I've already had all my fun  
Everybody tried to push me  
Push me around  
Everybody tried to put me  
Try to put me down  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
I'm an outsider  
Outside of everything  
Everything you know  
Everything you know  
  
It disturbs me so

Ready for a cheap escape  
On the brink of self destruction  
Widespread panic  
Broken glass inside my head  
Bleeding down these thoughts of  
Anguish... mass confusion  
The world is a sick machine  
Breeding a mass of shit  
With such a desolate conclusion  
Fill the void with... I don't care  
There's a plague inside of me  
Eating at my disposition  
Nothing's left  
Torn out of reality  
Into a state of no opinion  
Limp with hate

Now I rest my head from  
Such an endless dreary time  
A time of hopes and happiness  
That had you on my mind  
Those days are gone, and now it seems  
As if I'll get some rest  
But now and then I'll see you again  
And it puts my heart to the test  
  
[Chorus]  
So when are all my problems going to end?  
I'm understanding now that  
We are only friends  
To this day I'm asking why  
I still think about you  
  
As the days go on I wonder  
(Will this ever end?)  
I find it hard to keep control  
When you're with your boyfriend  
I do not mind if all I am is  
Just a friend to you  
But all I want to know right now  
Is if you think about me too  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Well, I've got a fever  
A non-believer  
I'm in a state of grace  
For I am the seizer  
I'm gonna seize the day  
Well, call of the banshee, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
As God as my witness  
The infidels are gonna pay  
  
Well, call the assassin  
The orgasm  
A spasm of love and hate  
For what will divide us?  
The righteous and the meek  
Well, call of the wild, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Death to the girl at the end of the serenade  
  
Vendetta, sweet vendetta  
This Beretta of the night  
This fire and the desire  
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite  
  
I am a killjoy from Detroit  
I drink from a well of rage  
I feed off the weakness with all my love  
Call up at the captain, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Death to the lover that you were dreaming of  
  
This is a stand-off  
A Molotov cocktail  
On the house  
You thought I was a write-off  
You better think again  
Call the peacemaker, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
I'm gonna send you back to the place where it all began  
  
Vendetta, sweet vendetta  
This Beretta of the night  
This fire and the desire  
Shots ringing out on a holy parasite  
  
Well now the caretaker's the undertaker  
Now I'm gonna go out and get the peacemaker  
This is the Neo St. Valentine's massacre  
Well call up the Gaza, hey hey  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Death to the ones at the end of the serenade  
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade  
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade  
Well, death to the ones at the end of the serenade

You're rise and fall  
Back up against the wall  
What goes around is coming back and haunting you  
It's time to quit  
'Cause you ain't worth the shit  
Under my shoes or the piss on the ground  
  
No one loves you and you know it  
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care  
'Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want to hear  
  
'Cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you  
I heard your sick  
Sucked on that cancer stick  
A throbbing tumor and a radiation high  
Shit out of luck  
And now your time is up  
It brings me pleasure just to know your going to die  
  
No one loves you and you know it  
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care  
'Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want to hear  
'Cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you  
Dickhead, fuck face, cock smoking,  
Mother fucking, asshole, dirty twat  
Waste of semen, I hope you die hey  
  
Red eye, code blue  
I'd like to strangle you  
And watch your eyes bulge right out of your skull  
When you go down  
Head first into the ground  
I'll stand above you just to piss on your grave  
  
No one loves you and you know it  
Don't pretend that you enjoy it or you don't care  
'Cause now I wouldn't lie or tell you all the things you want to hear  
'Cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you, 'cause I hate you

Where'er you go,  
You know I'll be there.  
If you go far,  
You know I'll be there.  
I'll go anywhere,  
So I'll see you there.  
You place the name,  
You know I'll be there.  
You name the time,  
You know I'll be there.  
I'll go anywhere,  
So I'll see you there.  
  
I don't care if you don't mind,  
I'll be there not far behind.  
I will dare, Keep in mind,  
I'll be there for you.  
  
When there's a truth,  
You know I'll be there.  
Amongst the lies,  
You know I'll be there.  
I'll go anywhere,  
So I'll see you there.  
  
I don't care if you don't mind,  
I'll be there not far behind.  
I will dare, Keep in mind,  
I'll be there for you.  
  
(Alright.)  
  
If you should fall,  
You know I'll be there.  
To catch the call,  
You know I'll be there.  
I'll go anywhere,  
So I'll see you there.  
  
I don't care if you don't mind,  
I'll be there not far behind.  
I will dare, Keep in mind,  
I don't care.  
  
I'll be there for you,  
I'll be there for you.  
I'll be there for you.

I wander down these streets all by myself  
Think of my future now  
I just don't know  
I don't see to care  
I stop to notice that  
I'm by your home  
I wonder if you're sitting all alone  
Or is your boyfriend there  
  
Because I feel so right  
Let my imagination go  
Until you're in my sight  
And through my veins  
Temptation flows  
  
So I sit down here on the hard concrete  
Think of my future now  
I just don't know  
I don't seem to care  
So I sit across the street from your home  
I wonder if you're sitting all alone  
Or is your boyfriend there

I see you, down in the front line.  
Such a sight for sore eyes, you're a suicide makeover.  
Plastic eyes, lookin' through a numb skull.  
Self-effaced, what's his face.  
You erased yourself so shut up.  
You don't let up.  
  
You have a growth that must be treated  
Like a severed severe pain in the neck.  
You can smell it but you can't see it.  
No explanation identified 'cause you don't know.  
You don't say.  
  
And you got no reply.  
Hey you, where did you come from?  
Got a head full of lead, you're a inbred bastard son.  
All dressed up, red blooded,  
A mannequin Do or die, no reply, don't deny that you're synthetic.  
You're pathetic.

I'm all busted up  
Broken bones and nasty cuts  
Accidents will happen  
But this time I can't get up  
She comes to check on me  
Making sure I'm on my knees  
After all she's the one  
Who put me in this state  
  
Is she ultra violent?  
Is she disturbed?  
I better tell her that I love her  
Before she does it all over again  
Oh God, she's killing me!!!  
  
For now I lie around  
Hell that's all I can really do  
She takes good care of me  
Just keep saying my love is true  
  
Is she ultra violent?  
Is she disturbed?  
I better tell her that I love her  
Before she does it all over again  
Oh God, she's killing me!!!  
  
Looking out my window for someone that's passing by  
No one knows I'm locked in here  
All I do is cry  
  
For now I lie around  
Hell that's all I can really do  
She takes good care of me  
Just keep saying my love is true

We're living in repetition  
Content in the same old shtick again  
Now the routine's turning to contention,  
Like a production line going over and over and over,  
Roller coaster  
Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice  
I'm speechless and redundant  
Cause I love you's not enough  
I'm lost for words  
Choreographed and lack of passion  
Prototypes of what we were  
Went full circle 'til I'm nauseous  
Taken for granted now  
Now I waste it, faked it, ate it, now I hate it  
Now I cannot speak, I lost my voice  
I'm speechless and redundant,  
Cause I love you's not enough  
I'm lost for words, now I cannot speak

Who the hell are you to tell me  
What I am and what's my master plan  
What makes you think that it includes you  
Self-righteous wealth  
Stop flattering yourself  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-American  
Sucking up your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone  
You're not my type  
Not my type  
  
What's the difference between you and me  
I do what I want and you do what you're told  
So listen up and shut the hell up  
It's no big deal and I'll see you in hell  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-American  
Sucking up your social sect  
Making you a nervous wreck  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone  
You're not my type  
Not my type  
Not my type  
You're not my type  
  
So when the smoke clears here I am  
Your reject all-American  
Falling from grace right on my face  
To hell and back and hell again I've gone

Hey, can you hear me?  
I'm calling your name  
Hello, or is this goodbye?  
The gleam in your eyes  
It troubles my brain  
Will I see it again?  
So I can rest my head  
  
Angel, angel! Dancing away  
As all of my thoughts get rearranged  
Angel, angel! Turning away  
Just when thing seem  
To have changed  
So I can rest my head  
  
Hey, can you hear me?  
I'm calling your name  
Hello, or is this goodbye?  
The gleam in your eyes  
It troubles my brain  
Will I see it again?  
So I can rest my head

I've got a really bad disease  
It's got me begging  
On my hands and knees  
So take me to the emergency  
Cause something seems to be missing  
Somebody take the pain away  
It's like an ulcer bleeding in my brain  
Send me to the pharmacy  
So I can lose my memory  
I'm elated  
Medicated  
Lord knows I tried to find a way to run away  
  
I think they found another cure  
For broken hearts and feeling insecure  
You'd be surprised what I endure  
What make you feel self-assure?  
  
I need to find a place to hide  
You never know what could be  
Waiting outside  
The accidents you could find  
It's like some kind of suicide  
  
So what ails you is what impales you  
I feel like I've been crucified to be satisfied  
  
I'm a victim of my symptom  
I am my own worst enemy  
You're a victim of your symptom  
You are your own worst enemy  
Know your enemy  
  
I'm elated  
Medicated  
I am my own worst enemy  
So what ails you is what impales you  
You are your own worst enemy  
You're a victim of the system  
You are your own worst enemy  
You're a victim of the system  
You are your own worst enemy

I always waste my time just wondering  
What the next man thinks of me  
I'll never do exactly what I want  
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance  
  
I always waste my time just wondering  
What the next man thinks of me  
I'll never do exactly what I want  
And I'll sculpt my life for your acceptance  
  
And I feel forgotten  
Feel like rotting  
(Do you feel the same?)  
(Do you feel the same?)  
Adolescence  
Just can't make sense  
(It's calling my name)  
(It's calling my name)  
  
[Chorus]  
I take a look around  
And all the things I've found  
I call it blind hatred  
If you'd stop a while  
And maybe if you'd smile  
You would realize that  
We're all the same  
  
It's just like our brain  
When it goes insane  
We feel the same pain  
  
All my life I've seemed to have this need  
I think at times it even turns to greed  
We all want to join some family  
We'll even sacrifice a moral changing  
  
And I feel forgotten  
Feel like rotting  
(Do you feel the same?)  
(Do you feel the same?)  
Adolescence  
Just can't make sense  
(It's calling my name)  
(It's calling my name)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's just like our brain  
When it goes insane  
We feel the same pain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's just like our brain  
When it goes insane  
We feel the same pain

I got a rock n' roll band  
I got a rock n' roll life  
I got a rock n' roll girlfriend  
And another ex-wife  
  
I got a rock n' roll house  
I got a rock n' roll car  
I play the shit out the drums  
And I can play the guitar  
  
I got a kid in New York  
I got a kid in the Bay  
I haven't drank or smoked nothin'  
In over 22 days  
  
So get off of my case  
Get off of my case  
  
Off of my case!

You better watch out,  
You better not cry,  
You better not pout  
And I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making his list, checking it twice  
Gonna find out if you're naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when youve been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
O, You better watch out,  
You better not cry,  
You better not pout  
And I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
O, You better watch out,  
You better cry,  
You better not pout,  
And I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making his list, checking it twice  
Gonna find out if you're naughty or nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees you when you're sleeping  
He knows when youve been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
Santa Claus is coming, to, towwwwwwwwn

Roaming 'round your house  
Wasting your time  
No obligation, just  
Wasting your time  
So why are you alone?  
Wasting your time  
When you could be with me  
Wasting your time  
  
I'm a waste like you  
With nothing else to do  
May I waste your time, too?  
  
Warding off regrets  
Wasting your time  
Smoking cigarettes  
Wasting your time  
I'm just a parasite  
Wasting your time  
Applying myself to  
Wasting your time

You come around every now and then  
Your clothes are different but you're still the same  
Why else would you come here?  
Scumbag on a mission  
You're telling me that it's been awhile  
Shit eating grin and a brand new lie  
Somebody let you come here  
Scumbag with permission  
  
Never thought I'd see  
The likes of you around this place  
What's the special occasion?  
Did you run out of friends?  
  
Here you are, comin' 'round again  
And things are different but you still pretend  
You've got a reason to come here  
Scumbag with ambition  
And now you're telling me that things have changed  
And you'll be leavin' in a couple of days  
You're gonna change the world someday  
Scumbag with a vision  
  
It must be nice to know  
You've got it all figured out  
But from where I'm sittin'  
It's the same thing again and again  
  
You never stop to think  
Before you open up your mouth  
Cause every time you do  
It's the same thing again and again

She  
She screams in silence.  
A sulley roit penetrating through her mind.  
Waiting for a sign to smash the silence with the brick of self control.  
  
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?  
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?  
Scream at me until my ears bleed.  
I'm taking heed in just for you.  
  
She  
She's figured out all her doubts were someone else's point of view.  
Waking up this time to smash the silence with the brick of self control.  
  
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?  
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?  
Scream at me until my ears bleed.  
I'm taking heed in just for you.  
  
Are you locked up in a world that's been planned out for you?  
Are you feeling like a social tool without a use?  
Scream at me until my ears bleed.  
I'm taking heed in just for you.

She's a rebel  
She's a saint  
She's salt of the earth  
And she's dangerous  
  
She's a rebel  
Vigilante  
Missing link on the brink  
Of destruction  
  
From Chicago to Toronto  
She's the one that they  
Call old what's her name  
  
She's the symbol  
Of resistance  
And she's holding on my  
Heart like a hand grenade  
  
Is she dreaming  
What I'm thinking  
Is she the mother of all bombs  
Gonna detonate  
  
Is she trouble  
Like I'm trouble  
Make it a double  
Twist of fate  
Or a melody that,  
  
She sings the revolution  
The dawning of our lives  
She brings this liberation  
That I just can't define  
Nothing comes to mind  
  
She's a rebel  
She's a saint  
She's salt of the earth  
And she's dangerous  
  
She's a rebel  
Vigilante  
Missing link on the brink  
Of destruction  
  
She's a rebel,  
She's a rebel,  
She's a rebel,  
And she's dangerous  
She's a rebel,  
She's a rebel,  
She's a rebel,  
And she's dangerous

Shoplifter you'll never learn  
When you commit the crime  
Shoplifter your getting burned  
And now you gotta the time  
  
It's a one, two, three on the felony  
Well not everything is free  
Now that you've served the community  
It's a life of a petty thief  
  
It's not considered stealing  
Unless your getting caught  
But you be caught stealing  
Trying to take something you haven't got  
  
Shoplifter you'll never learn  
With lies behind your back  
Not a burgular, or a bankrobber just a kleptomaniac  
  
It's not considered stealing  
Unless your getting caught  
But you be caught stealing  
Trying to take something you haven't got  
  
Shoplifter you'll never learn  
When you commit the crime  
Shoplifter your getting burned  
And now you gotta do the time  
Well now you gotta do the time  
Well now you gotta do some time

Why can't you just admit it,  
You've had it, you're  
Sick of me  
  
You're fed up  
With my almighty attitude  
Sick of me  
  
Generalize  
You've become so desensitized  
Sick of me  
  
Loss of breath  
I can see that you've had it, you're  
Sick of me  
  
Wandering out the door  
I am on to you  
You're comin' back for more  
Am I losing you?  
  
Like a dog  
That just pissed on your barbecue  
Sick of me  
  
Losing faith  
And you still don't know what to do  
Sick of me  
  
Loss of love  
Now you hate everything and you're  
Sick of me  
  
It's a waste  
But we still keep on trying, you're  
Sick of me  
  
Wandering out the door  
I am on to you  
You're comin' back for more  
Am I losing you?  
  
So you got your problems  
So you've got your worries  
Do you have a conscience?  
Do you have a need?  
Well I'm sick of you too.

You don't look at me no more and I don't  
look at you  
Well that all right pretty baby, cuz I'm just  
looking for something to do  
You're telling me that you don't feel the  
same  
Well that's all right pretty baby, cuz I don't  
mind driving myself insane, sometimes  
I don't mind at all, and then again  
sometimes baby  
I feel like my whole world's gonna fall apart  
When you tell me you don't feel the same,  
but that's all right pretty baby, cuz I don't  
mind being insane  
Sometimes  
You don't talk to me no more, and I don't  
talk to you  
Well that's all right pretty baby, cuz I'm just  
looking for something to prove  
You're telling me that you don't feel the  
same  
Well that's all right pretty baby, cuz I don't  
mind driving myself insane, sometimes  
I don't mind at all, and then again  
sometimes baby  
I feel like my whole worlds gonna fall apart  
When you tell me that you don't feel the  
same, but that's all right pretty baby, cuz  
I don't mind being insane  
Sometimes

[Verse 1]  
I'm running late to somewhere now  
I don't want to be  
Where the future and promises ain't what it used to be  
I never wanted to compromise and bargain with my soul  
How did life on the wild side ever get so dull?  
  
I've grown up and am medicated  
On my own Cellular waves  
I put the riot in Patriot  
And we all die in threes  
I got a scene in the middle of the road  
Im gonna take my time  
I shop online so I can vote  
At the speed of life  
Im like a drone way up in the sky  
Im a shooting star  
There's a soldier thats freaking out  
Because this is war!  
  
I've grown up and am medicated  
On my own Cellular waves  
I put the riot in Patriot  
And we all die in threes  
  
All I want is weed and guns  
A new catastrophe, yeah  
Here comes nothing, theres nothing to lose  
Its a small price we pay  
When we all die in threes  
  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere now  
  
Hallelujiah! I found my soul  
Under the sofa pillows  
Congratulations, I found myself  
Somewhere now  
Somewhere Now  
Somewhere Now

St. Jimmy's comin' down across the alleyway  
Up on the boulevard like a zip gun on parade  
Light of a silhouette  
He's insubordinate  
Coming at you on the count of one, two (one, two, three, four)  
  
My name is Jimmy and you better not wear it out  
Suicide commando that your momma talked about  
King of the forty thieves  
And I'm here to represent  
That needle in the vein of the establishment  
  
I'm the patron saint of the denial  
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal  
Cigarettes and Ramen and a little bag of dope  
I am the son of a bitch and Edgar Allan Poe  
Raised in the city under a halo of lights  
  
The product of war and fear that we've been victimized  
I'm the patron saint of the denial  
With an angel face and a taste for suicidal  
Are you talkin' to me?  
I'll give you something to cry about St. Jimmy  
  
My name is St. Jimmy I'm a son of a gun  
I am the one that's from the way outside  
A teenage assassin executing some fun  
In the cult of the life of crime  
I'd really hate to say it but I told you so  
  
So shut your mouth before I shoot you down ol' boy  
Welcome to the club and give me some blood  
I'm the resident leader of the lost and found  
It's comedy and tragedy, it's St. Jimmy  
And that's my name, and don't wear it out

Well I ain't got much time so I'll get to the point  
Do you wanna share a ride and get the fuck out of this joint?  
I've got an impulse so impulsive that it burns  
I wanna break your heart until it makes your stomach churn  
  
I got to know if you're the one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
  
I'm just sick and tired of feeling so alone  
I don't understand the point if you have to go home  
So won't you stay and count the circles 'round my eyes?  
And we can watch the stars until the sun begins to rise  
  
I got to know if you're the one one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
  
I got to know if you're the one one that got away  
Even though it was never meant to be  
  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
Say, you'll stay the night  
Because we're running out of time  
So stay the night  
I don't wanna say goodbye

Looking at the clouds in the sky  
Floating image in my mind  
Land of beauty and land of peace  
Now I wonder where this place is from  
  
The evidence is everywhere  
I start to run, now I'm scared  
Strange beings all around  
Come everyone to this place I've found  
  
I'm feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries  
  
My eyes are clear and now I'm cured  
Don't you wanna be for sure?  
I know my rights I'm allowed to die  
So I'd rather swap your different guise  
  
It's in my head if you will find  
Mother love from all mankind  
You look above and then you shout  
No other way to say your head is alright  
  
Feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries  
  
I'm feeling psyched to be walking  
I wonder why  
All my joys could be open  
No more cries

I lost my way  
Oh baby this stray heart  
Went to another  
Can you recover baby?  
Oh you're the only one that I'm dreamin' of  
Your precious heart  
Was torn apart by me and you  
  
You're not alone  
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong  
We're not alone  
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just can't have you  
  
I said a thousand times  
And now a thousand one  
We'll never part  
I'll never stray again from you  
This dog is destined for a home to your heart  
We'll never part  
I'll never stray again from you  
You're not alone  
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong  
We're not alone  
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just can't have you  
  
You're not alone  
Oh oh and now I'm where I belong  
We're not alone  
Oh oh I'll hold your heart and never let go  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just can't have you  
  
Everything that I want  
I want from you  
But I just can't have you  
Everything that I need  
I need from you  
But I just  
Just can't have you

I'm not part of your elite  
I'm just alright  
Class structure waving colors  
Bleeding from my throat  
Not subservient to you I'm just alright  
Down classed by the powers that be  
Give me loss of hope  
Cast out...buried in a hole  
Struck down...forcing me to fall  
Destroyed...giving up the fight  
I know I'm not alright  
What's my price and will you pay it if it's alright?  
Take it from my dignity  
Waste it until it's dead  
Throw me back into the gutter  
Cause it's alright  
Find another pleasure fucker  
Drag them down to hell

Walking down the street, and I find it out if I should leave  
(Cause I've been feeling pretty worthless lately)  
Now I think we should find a place downtown  
A place that I used to hang around  
(and get us something, a cappuccino maybe)  
  
I'm so let down  
I'm so good now  
Now I feel just like superman, going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah  
And I feel just like Romeo, if you want a golden rose  
I feel just like Romeo, ohhh yeah  
  
Now I'll have cab or bus and we're  
(Driving down mile 69, here on a bus)  
And I'm finding my way back home  
Because I'm taking back control of my life  
Not afraid cause it feels so right  
(and I feel so much better for this, for this baby)  
  
I'm so let down,  
I'm so good now  
Now I feel just like superman, going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah  
And I feel just like Romeo, if you want a golden rose  
I feel just like Romeo, ohhh yeah  
  
I'm so let down,  
I'm so good now  
(Yeah I felt so pushed around man)  
Now I feel just like superman, going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah  
And I feel just like Romeo, if you want a golden rose  
I feel just like Romeo  
  
And I feel just like superman (fade)  
Going everywhere I can  
I feel just like superman, yeah

See a young girl so soft and blonde.  
Doesn't attack me but she did once.  
Intoxication's in her veins.  
Sweet young boy plays with her brain.  
Lydia'll bring to life.  
What are your chance not to oblige.  
Putting his hand on her thigh.  
Ability has now been ripped.  
Take it away, I'd rather sit.  
Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children. Remember when.  
Johnny's playing fun and games, or else he's ?in the storage shed?.  
Running from the light of day, or maybe lie and celebrate.  
The funny circus from his head.  
Follow me if you understand.  
I'll trick her so she'll do it.  
Then I'll sing and now we run.  
Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children. Remember when.  
Sweet children, sweet children, sweet children. Remember when

Big wheels keep on turning  
Carry me home to see my kin  
Singing songs about the southland  
I miss my family once again and I think it's a sin  
  
Well, I heard Mr. Young sing about her  
Well, I heard Ol' Neil put her down  
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember  
A Southern man don't need him around anyhow  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
  
In Birmingham they love the governor boo, hoo hoo  
Now we all did what we could do  
Now Watergate does not bother me  
Does your conscience bother you, tell me true  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you  
Here I come Alabama  
  
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers  
They've been known to pick a song or two  
Lord, they get me off so much  
They pick me up when I'm feelin' blue, now how about you?  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue, oh, sweet home  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you and the gov'nor's true  
  
Sweet home Alabama  
Where the skies are so blue, oh yeah  
Sweet home Alabama  
Lord, I'm coming home to you, yeah yeah

To live and not to breathe  
Is to die in tragedy  
To run, to run away  
To find what you believe  
And I leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
I lost my faith to this  
This town that don't exist  
So I run, I run away  
The light of masochist  
And I leave behind  
This hurricane of fucking lies  
And I walked this line  
A million and one fucking times  
But not this time  
I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize  
When there ain't nowhere you can go  
Running away from pain  
When you've been victimized  
Tales from another broken home  
You're leaving, you're leaving  
You're leaving, ah, you're leaving home

Ddt did a job on me  
Now I am a real sickie  
Guess I'll have to break the news  
That I got no mind to lose  
All the girls are in love with me  
I'm a teenage lobotomy  
  
Slugs and snails are after me  
Ddt keeps me happy  
Now I guess I'll have to tell 'em  
That I got no cerebellum  
Gonna get my Ph. D.  
I'm a teenage lobotomy  
  
Lobotomy!  
Lobotomy!  
Lobotomy!  
Lobotomy!  
  
Ddt did a job on me  
Now I am a real sickie  
Guess I'll have to break the news  
That I got no mind to lose  
All the girls are loving me  
I'm a teenage lobotomy

My heart is beating from me  
I'm standing all alone  
Please call me only  
If you are coming home  
  
Waste a year it flies by  
Waste a night or two  
You taught me how to live  
  
In the streets of shame  
When you've lost your dreams in the rain  
There's no signs of hope  
The stems and seeds of the last of the dope  
  
There's a glow of light  
The Saint Jimmy is the spark in the night  
Bearing gifts and trust  
A fixture in the city of lust  
  
What the hells your name  
Whats your pleasure, what is your pain  
Do you dream too much?  
Do you think what you need is a crutch  
  
In the crowd of pain  
Saint Jimmy comes without any shame  
He says "We're fucked up but we're not the same"  
And mom and dad are the ones you can blame  
  
Jimmy died today  
He blew his brains out into the bay  
In the state of mind  
Is my own private suicide

[Originally by Survivor]  
  
Rising up, back on the street  
Did my time, took my chances  
Went the distance, now I'm back on my feet  
Just a man and his will to survive  
  
So many times, it happens too fast  
You change your passion for glory  
Don't lose your grip on the dreams of the past  
You must fight just to keep them alive  
  
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
And he's watching us all in the eye of the tiger  
  
Face to face, out in the heat  
Hanging tough, staying hungry  
They stack the odds 'til we take to the street  
For we kill with the skill to survive  
  
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
And he's watching us all in the eye of the tiger  
  
Rising up, straight to the top  
Have the guts, got the glory  
Went the distance, now I'm not gonna stop  
Just a man and his will to survive  
  
It's the eye of the tiger, it's the thrill of the fight  
Rising up to the challenge of our rival  
And the last known survivor stalks his prey in the night  
And he's watching us all in the eye of the tiger  
  
The eye of the tiger  
[Repeats out]...

Princess in a school girl's dream  
May I please speak with you  
I'm having troubles with control  
And it's all because of you  
Today I kept on falling down  
I thought it was the street  
So I look down at my shoes  
They were on the wrong feet  
  
I find it hard to be myself  
(can you please explain)  
I do not think it's my health  
(you're the one to blame)  
You're the one I wish I had  
And now my girlfriend is getting mad  
(I cannot call this sane)  
  
Today as I was walking down  
You bumped into me  
You said, "excuse me" and walked away  
As I dropped to my knees  
I prayed to the being in the sky  
That my parents told me of  
I asked about you but no reply  
No clues about your love  
My girlfriend left me on the phone  
I'm pathetically left here alone  
(I cannot call this sane)  
  
Can we find a way  
So that you can stay  
I think I'm gonna Pop
