A house with love in it is rich indeed  
Although there are a thousand things that house may need  
  
The carpet may be old, the room so plain and bare  
And yet it's beautiful somehow when love is living there  
  
A house with love in it just seems to bloom  
As though the month of may were filling every room  
  
So darling true the years with all my heart I'll pray  
A house with love in it is where we'll stay  
  
So darling true the years with all my heart I'll pray  
A house with love in it is where we'll stay.

That certain night, the night we met,  
There was magic abroad in the air.  
There were angels dining at the ritz,  
And a nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
I may be right, i may be wrong,  
But i'm perfectly willing to swear  
That when you turned and smiled at me,  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
The moon that lingered over londontown  
Poor puzzled moon, he wore a frown.  
How could he know that we two were so in love?  
The whole darn world seemed upside down.  
  
The streets of town were paved with stars,  
It was such a romantic affair.  
And as we kissed and said goodnight,  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.  
  
When dawn came stealing up, all gold and blue  
To interrupt our rendez-vous,  
I still remember how you smiled and said,  
"was that a dream? or was it true?"  
  
Our homeward step was just as light  
As the dancing of fred astaire,  
And like an echo far away  
A nightingale sang in berkeley square.

When you raise your eyes and make believe,  
All the stars come out and paint a world of blue.  
There's my heart right up your sleeve  
Waiting all for you.  
  
When you smile on me, the world is mine,  
And the dreams I dream, I know will all come true.  
Every care becomes divine  
Waiting all for you.  
  
My heart is beating to the old refrain  
When I'm alone with you.  
My heart's repeating, "I'm in love again"  
Can't we hold a rendez-vous?  
  
You're the dreams I dream, the song I sing  
You're the stars and moon and nearly everything.  
Life would be a symphony,  
Waiting all for you.  
  
My heart is beating to the old refrain  
When I'm alone with you.  
My heart's repeating, "I'm in love again"  
Can't we hold a rendez-vous?  
  
You're the dreams I dream, the song I sing  
You're the stars and moon and nearly everything.  
Life would be a symphony,  
Living all for you.

All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth, my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie, sitting on a thistle?  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth, my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
My two front teeth, my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie, sitting on a thistle?  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
Two front teeth, two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth  
Then I could wish you, Merry Christmas  
  
It seems so long since I could say  
Sister Susie, sitting on a thistle?  
Gosh, oh gee, how happy I'd be  
If I could only whistle  
  
All I want for Christmas is my two front teeth  
Two front teeth, my two front teeth  
Gee, if I could only have my two front teeth

All over the world  
All over the world  
  
Love is the thing  
It's the one thing, you'll see  
All that it takes  
Is a he and a she  
  
All over the world  
All over the world  
  
Love was and love is  
And always will be  
All over the world  
  
(Whether you're in  
Maine or California  
Doesn't matter, I know  
You can be in Tennessee or  
You can be in old Mexico)  
  
(It can happen  
Summer, spring or fall or  
When the winter winds blow  
Love is a wonderful thing)  
  
Lovers can be found  
In foggy London town  
In Rome or Peru  
  
Even in Damascus  
Lovers never ask us  
What they should do  
  
You don't have to park  
In Paris after dark  
To know that it's true  
Love is a wonderful thing  
  
All over the world  
All over the world  
  
Love was and love is  
And always will be  
All over the world  
All over the world

What a day this has been!  
What a rare mood I'm in!  
Why, it's almost like being in love  
  
There's a smile on my face  
For the whole human race  
Why it's almost like being in love  
  
All the music of life seems to be  
Like a bell that is ringing for me  
And from the way that I feel  
When the bell starts to peal  
I would swear I was falling  
I could swear I was falling  
It's almost like being in love  

Got up this morning  
Along about dawn  
Without a warning  
I found she was gone  
  
Why should she do it  
How could she do it  
She'd never done it  
Before...  
  
Am I blue?  
Am I blue?  
Ain't these tears  
In these eyes  
Tellin' you?  
  
Am I blue?  
You'd be too  
If your dreams  
And your schemes  
Just fell through  
  
Was a time  
I was her only one  
But now I'm  
The sad and  
Lonely one  
  
Was I gay  
Till today?  
Now she's gone  
And we're through  
Am I blue?

I never thought that I could find  
(Angel smile) Heaven on Earth  
And peace of mind (angel smile)  
Someone to love me all the time  
(Angel smile) oh, whoa, oh, oh  
  
And then I saw your angel smile  
It made my heart start jumping  
And my nerves start running wild  
(You made my nerves start running wild)  
  
I been to dances by the score  
(Angel smile) I never cared  
To dance before (angel smile)  
But there I was on the ballroom floor  
(Angel smile) oh, oh, whoa, oh  
  
It only took your angel smile  
To make the music move me  
And my feet start running wild  
(You made my feet start running wild)  
  
What chases the blue  
When I am low (angel smile)  
What gives me that tender  
Loving glow (angel smile)  
And what will I always cherish so  
(Angel smile) oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And when I see your angel smile  
I dream of you there beside me  
As we both walk down the aisle  
(You make me feet walk down the aisle)  
  
What chases the blue  
When I am low (angel smile)  
What gives me that tender  
Loving glow (angel smile)  
And what will I always cherish so  
(Angel smile) oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
And when I see your angel smile  
I dream of you there beside me  
As we both walk down the aisle

Answer me  
Oh my love  
Just what sin have I been guilty of  
Tell me how I came to lose your love  
Please answer me  
My love.  
You were mine yesterday  
I believed that love was here to stay  
Won't you tell me where I've gone astray  
Please answer me  
My love.  
If you're happier without me  
I'll try not to care  
But if you still think about me  
Please listen to my prayer  
You must know I've been true  
Won't you say that we can start anew?  
In my sorrow now I turn to you  
Please answer me  
My love.

Around the world, I've searched for you  
I traveled on when hope was gone  
To keep a rendezvous  
I know somewhere, sometime, somehow  
  
You'd look at me  
And I would see the smile you're smiling now  
  
It might have been in County Down  
Or in New York  
  
In Gay Paree or even London Town  
No more will I go all around the world  
For I have found my world in you  
  
It might have been in County Down  
Or in New York

Ask me if I love you  
Ask how much I care  
Count the stars above you  
The answer is there  
  
Ask how much I need you  
Darling, I'd reply  
Can you count the ripples  
In streams passing by  
  
Ask me if I'd miss you  
If our dreams fell through  
Would the summer roses  
Miss the morning dew  
  
Ask me if I'll love you  
When years have flown away  
Darling, I will love you  
Much more than today  
  
Ask me if I'll love you  
When years have flown away  
Darling, I will love you  
Much more than today

At the end of a rainbow  
You'll find a pot of gold  
At the end of a story  
You'll find it's all been told  
  
But our love has a treasure  
Our heart's can't always spend  
And it has a story without any end  
  
At the end of a river  
The water stops it's flow  
At the end of a highway  
There's no place you can go  
  
But just tell me you love me  
And you are only mine  
And our love will go on 'til the end of time  
  
At the end of the rainbow  
You'll find a pot of gold  
At the end of a story  
You'll find it's all been told  
  
But our love has a treasure  
Our heart's can't always spend  
And it has a story without any end  
  
At the end of a river  
The water stops it's flow  
At the end of a highway  
There's no place you can go  
  
But just tell me you love me  
And you are only mine  
And our love will go on  
'Til the e-end of time  
  
'Til the end of time ...

Buon Natale, means Merry Christmas to you  
Buon Natale to everyone, Happy New Year and lots of fun  
Buon Natale, may all your wishes come true  
Buon Natale in Italy means a Merry Christmas to you  
  
Far away across the sea in sunny Italy  
There's a quaint little town  
Not a clock has been wound  
For over a century  
  
They don't know the time or year  
And no one seems to care  
And this is the reason the Christmas season  
Is celebrated all year  
  
Oh, Buon Natale, a Merry Christmas to you  
Buon Natale to everyone, Happy New Year and lots of fun  
Buon Natale, may all your wishes come true  
Buon Natale to Italy means a Merry Christmas to you

Don't treat me stomach very nice.

Cup of coffee, ham on rye.

These Yankee girl give me big scare,  
Is black de root, is blond de hair.  
Her eyelash false, her face is paint,  
And pads are where de girl she ain't!  
  
She jitterbug when she should waltz,  
I even think her name is false.  
But calypso girl is good a lot,  
Is what you see, is what she got.  
  
Sittin' by de ocean  
Me heart, she feel so sad,  
Sittin' by de ocean,  
Me heart, she feel so sad  
Don't got de money  
To take me back to Trinidad.

Will I ever love you again  
Tell me, why then can't I  
Maybe others  
Want you just like I do  
Tell me, why then can't I  
You might have known others  
  
So have I

And dessert you  
That's why I o-only want to  
  
Hold you, always  
Never to let you go

I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.  
Just got the news that my best gal has left me to stay.  
Things were pretty rosy,  
We got along so fine.  
Until another guy moved in  
And handed her a line.  
I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.  
  
  
So I decided to try and get her off my mind.  
Started to walkin', to see what enjoyment I'd find.  
Was invited to a party,  
Then there was a fight.  
A fella got a whippin'...  
You guessed it right.  
I don't know why I'm so doggone unlucky today.

Dance ballerina dance  
And do your pirouette in rhythm with your achin' heart.  
Dance ballerina dance  
You mustn't once forget a dancer has to dance the part.  
  
Whirl ballerina whirl  
And just ignore the chair that's empty in the second row.  
This is your moment girl  
Although he's not out there applauding as you steal the show.  
  
Once you said his love must wait it's turn  
You wanted fame instead.  
I guess that's your concern  
We live and learn.  
  
And love is gone ballerina gone  
So on with your career you can't afford a backward glance.  
Dance on and on and on  
A thousand people here have come to see the show  
As 'round and 'round you go  
So ballerina dance  
Dance dance!  
  
Whirl ballerina!  
  
Once you said his love must wait it's turn  
You wanted fame instead.  
I guess that's your concern  
We live and learn.  
  
And love is gone ballerina gone  
So on with your career you can't afford a backward glance  
Dance on and on and on  
A thousand people here have come to see the show  
As 'round and 'round you go  
So ballerina dance!  
  
Dance!

That same old voodoo follows me about  
That same old pounding in my heart, whenever I think of you  
And baby I think of you  
Day in and day out  
  
Day out, day in  
I needn't tell you how my days begin  
When I awake I get up with a tingle  
One possibility in view  
That possibility of maybe seeing you  
  
Come rain, come shine  
I meet you and to me the day is fine  
Then I kiss your lips, and the pounding becomes  
An oceans roar, a thousand drums  
Can't you see it's love, can there be any doubt  
When there it is, day in, day out

Deck the halls with boughs of holly  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
'Tis the season to be jolly  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Don we now our gay apparel  
Fa-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la.  
Troll the ancient Yule-tide carol  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la.  
  
See the blazing Yule before us.  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Strike the harp and join the chorus.  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Follow me in merry measure.  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
While I tell of Yule-tide treasure.  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
  
Fast away the old year passes.  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Hail the new year, lads and lasses  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Sing we joyous, all together.  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la  
Heedless of the wind and weather.  
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la-la

Come and take a trip in my rocket ship  
We'll have a lovely afternoon  
Kiss the world goodbye and away we fly  
  
Destination moon  
Travel fast as light 'til we're lost from sight  
The earth is like a toy balloon  
What a thrill you get ridin' on a jet  
  
Destination moon  
We'll go up up up up  
Straight to the moon we two  
High in the starry blue  
I'll be out of this world with you  
So away we steal in a space-mobile  
A supersonic honeymoon  
Leave your cares below, pull the switch, let's go!  
  
Destination moon  
There once was a time when the colorful thing to do  
Was to call for a date on a bicycle built for two  
But cars and trains and even planes  
  
All have had their day  
Now the time is due to call for you  
In the modern atomic way  
We'll go up up up up  
Straight to the moon we two  
High in the starry blue  
I'll be out of this world with you  
So away we steal in a space-mobile  
  
A supersonic honeymoon  
Leave your cares below, pull the switch, let's go!  
Destination moon

I was alone and fancy free  
Enjoying all my liberty  
  
I met you, baby  
Then things changed  
I started acting  
Oh, so strange  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do  
  
Well, every day I had a ball  
I didn't have a care at all  
And everything was just okay  
Until you made me change my way  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do  
  
Like a schoolboy  
Loves his cherry pie  
You really move me  
My, oh, my  
  
You caught me, baby  
I'm really hooked  
No doubt about it  
My goose is cooked  
  
It won't be long before I hear  
Her whisper softly in my ear  
I love you, baby, yes, I do  
And from now on  
It's me and you  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do  
  
Like a schoolboy  
Loves his cherry pie  
You really move me  
My, oh, my  
  
You caught me, baby  
I'm really hooked  
No doubt about it  
My goose is cooked  
  
It won't be long before I hear  
Her whisper softly in my ear  
I love you, baby, yes, I do  
And from now on  
It's me and you  
  
Do I like it, do I like it  
Yes, I do

Someone told someone and someone told you  
But they really wouldn't hurt you, not much  
But since everyone tells the story  
With his own little personal touch  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
Pay no attention to what's said  
Why people tear the seams  
Of anyone's dreams is over my head  
Do nothing till you hear from me  
At least consider our romance  
If you should take the words  
Of others you've heard, I haven't a chance  
True, I've been seen with someone new  
But does that mean that I've been untrue?  
When we're apart, the words in my heart  
Reveal how I feel about you  
Some kiss may cloud my memories  
And other arms may hold a thrill, yes yes yes  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
Some kiss may cloud my memory  
And other arms may hold a thrill, hold that thrill  
But please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will  
So please do nothing till you hear it from me  
And you never will

Missed the saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless, why stir up memories  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Awfully different without you  
Don't get around much anymore

Faith can move mountains  
Darling, you will see  
I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me  
  
Faith can work magic  
This I find with you  
Yours is the magic  
To make my wishes come true  
  
So, tell me again you love me  
Kiss me, and I'll be strong  
What couldn't I do when I know that you  
Are here to help me along?  
  
Yes, faith can move mountains  
Darling, you will see  
I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me  
  
So, tell me again you love me  
Kiss me, and I'll be strong  
What couldn't I do when I know that you  
Are here to help me along?  
  
Yes, faith can move mountains  
Darling, you will see  
I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me  
  
Yes, I can move mountains  
If you have faith in me

For all we know  
We may never meet again  
Before we go  
Make this moment sweet again  
We won't say goodbye  
Until the last minute  
I'll hold out my hand  
And my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know  
This may only be a dream  
We come and go  
Like the ripples on a stream  
So love me tonight  
Tomorrow was made for some  
Tomorrow may never come  
For all we know  
Yes, tomorrow may never, never come  
For all we know

I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I'll give you my heart  
  
I love you and you alone were meant for me  
Please give your loving heart to me  
And say we'll never part  
  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling, I'm never lonely  
Whenever you are in sight  
  
I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  
  
I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart

Frosty the snowman was a jolly happy soul,  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal.  
Frosty the snowman is a fairy tale, they say,  
He was made of snow but the children  
Know how he came to life one day.  
  
There must have been some magic in that  
Old silk hat they found.  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around.  
  
O, Frosty the snowman  
Was alive as he could be,  
And the children say he could laugh  
And play just the same as you and me.  
  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Look at Frosty go.  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Over the hills of snow.  
  
Frosty the snowman knew  
The sun was hot that day,  
So he said, "Let's run and  
We'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away."  
  
Down to the village,  
With a broomstick in his hand,  
Running here and there all  
Around the square saying,  
Catch me if you can.  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop.  
And he only paused a moment when  
He heard him holler "Stop!"  
  
For Frosty the snow man  
Had to hurry on his way,  
But he waved goodbye saying,  
"Don't you cry,  
I'll be back again some day."  
  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Look at Frosty go.  
Thumpetty thump thump,  
Thumpety thump thump,  
Over the hills of snow.

(Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji)  
Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
He was always in love, in love, in love  
  
Come to my tent, oh my beloved  
Bring me your lips, warm as the sun  
Hear my lament, oh my beloved  
Come to my arms, oh wonderful one  
  
Enter my heart and stay there forever  
Lost in the spell of stars up above  
And we'll be like the man Hajji Baba  
Always in love, always in love  
  
(Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji)  
Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
He was always in love, in love  
  
Deep in each soul, carefully hidden  
There's a desire to be indiscreet  
Hajji has said when love is forbidden  
Love is so sweet, love is so sweet  
  
Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba, Hajji Baba  
He was always in love, in love, in love  
  
Come to my arms, oh my beloved  
(Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji, Hajji) [fade]

Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Let's pretend that we're together all alone  
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low  
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go  
  
Whisper to me, tell me do you love me true  
Or is he holding you the way I do?  
Though love is blind, make up your mind, I've got to know  
Should I hang up or will you tell him he'll have to go?  
  
You can't say the words I want to hear  
While you're with another man  
If you want me answer yes or no  
Darling, I will understand  
  
Put your sweet lips a little closer to the phone  
Let's pretend that we're together all alone  
I'll tell the man to turn the jukebox way down low  
And you can tell your friend there with you he'll have to go

Here's to my lady, here's a toast to my lady,  
And all that my lady means to me!  
Like a hearth in the winter, a breeze in the summer,  
A spring to remember is she!  
  
Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,  
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!  
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady,  
I pray may she always love me!  
  
Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,  
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!  
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady,  
I pray may she always love me!

I don't want to be hurt anymore  
By a part-time love affair  
And I don't want to cry like before  
Why pretend, again, you care  
Please don't coax me back into your arms  
I've been fooled many times by-y your charms  
I know if I kissed you  
I might not resist you  
I don't want to be hurt anymore  
Please don't coax me back into your arms  
I've been fooled many times by-y your charms  
I know if I kissed you  
I might not resist you  
I don't want to be hurt anymore-ore

(I don't want to see tomorrow,  
unless I see it with you.)  
Tomorrow, so they say  
Will be a lovely day,  
A bright new sun will suddenly break through,  
But I don't want to see tomorrow,  
Unless I see it with you.  
Tomorrow, so I hear  
The clouds will disappear,  
The door to happiness will open wide.  
But I don't want to see tomorrow,  
Unless you're there by my side.  
Don't want to walk alone,  
Don't want to dream alone,  
Just want you close to my heart.  
For if your love is gone,  
How can I face the dawn of  
Sunday, or Monday?  
I just can't face one day...  
Until you say you're mine,  
Oh, darling, please be mine  
And make each bright tomorrow young and new.  
But I don't want to face tomorrow  
Unless I see it with you.  
(Tomorrow, so I hear  
The clouds will disappear,  
The door to happiness will open wide.)  
But I don't want to see tomorrow,  
Unless I see it with you.

In a dream the strangest and the oddest things appear  
And what insane and silly things we do.  
Here is what I see before me, vividly and clear,  
As I recall it, you were in it, too.  
  
I had the craziest dream, last night, yes I did  
I never dreamed it could be  
Yet there you were, in love with me  
  
I found your lips close to mine, so I kissed them  
And you didn't mind it at all  
When I'm awake, such a break never happens  
How long can I guy go on dreaming  
  
If there's a chance that you care  
Then, please, say that you do baby  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true

Maybe I talk too much,  
Maybe I've lost m' touch.  
I guess I don't know what's cookin'  
'Cause I just can't see for lookin'.  
  
Other boys have their chicks,  
Two, three, four, five or six.  
I don't seem to get a bookin'  
'Cause I just can't see for lookin'.  
  
I'm kinda crazy,  
Like a daisy  
Up that well known tree, poor me.  
I'm sittin', hopin',  
  
Horoscopin'  
Won't some sista take a chance with me?  
I've been around the town,  
Everyone brings me down.  
  
I give up hope, I'm just a dope.  
There ain't no gals for hookin',  
I just can't see for lookin'.  
I've been around the town,  
  
Everyone brings me down.  
I give up hope, I'm just a dope.  
There ain't no gals for hookin',  
I just can't see for lookin'...  
  
No, just can't see for lookin'...  
No, no.

I keep goin' back to Joe's  
To that table in the corner,  
Sippin' wine and staring at the door.  
Our old waiter knows we're through,  
Still he sets a place for you  
Everything the way it was before.  
I keep goin' back to Joe's,  
But the man who plays piano  
Never plays your favorite melody.  
Joe keeps busy at the bar,  
Never asks me where you are.  
He was there when you walked out on me.  
Now I pray you'll walk back in,  
And you'll say what fools we've been,  
And we'll celebrate a happy new beginning.  
Chances are you'll never show,  
But you'll know just where to find me  
Every night until it's time to close.  
Just in case you miss me, too,  
I'll be there to welcome you.  
That's why I keep going back...  
That's why I keep goin' back...  
To Joe's.

I know that you know  
That I'll go where you go  
I choose you, won't lose you  
I wish you knew how much I long  
To hold you in my arms  
  
This time is my time  
Will soon be goodbye time  
Then in the star light, hold me tight  
With one more little kiss  
Say, nighty night  
  
I know that you know  
That I'll go where you go  
I choose you, won't lose you  
I wish you knew how much I long  
To hold you in my arms  
  
This time is my time  
Will soon be goodbye time  
Then in the star light, hold me tight  
With one more little kiss  
Say, nighty night

I must be dreaming  
I must be dreaming  
I must be dreaming  
I must be because  
  
You say you love me  
You say you want me  
You say you need me  
And I can't believe that  
  
Someone as wonderful as you  
Could change my luck  
And make my dreams come true  
  
I must be dreaming  
But if I'm dreaming  
I'll go on dreaming  
The rest of my life  
Dreaming of you  
  
I must be dreaming  
But if I'm dreaming  
I'll go on dreaming  
The rest of my life  
Dreaming of you

My grammar ain't so good  
And I've got no Ph.D  
But there's more important things  
Than a college degree  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Your chick is all that matters  
I think you get what I mean  
  
There are ways to keep her happy  
Ways to lose a tune  
I don't take advice of no one  
I know just what to do  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Your chick is all that matters  
I think you get what I mean  
  
You give her lots of kisses  
And dine her with good food  
Work to keep her cheerful  
And in a loving mood  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Your chick is all that matters  
I think you get what I mean  
  
There're times when she'll stay out late  
And you'll be feeling blue  
Go on out and have a ball, son  
She'll come running back to you  
  
I think you get what I mean  
I think you get what I mean  
Have yourself a ball  
I think you get what I mean

Yes, I understand that I'm to set you free  
Yes, I understand you love her more than me  
I understand she won your heart  
Stoled your love, drew us apart  
I understand and so I'll let you go  
  
I tried my best to do the things  
I thought would please you, dear  
I never dreamed the time would come  
When you would not be here  
  
Yes, I understand what I'm supposed to do  
Find me someone else to take the place of you  
And if I live a hundred years  
I'll find some way to hide these tears  
I understand and so I'll let you go

I'd like to love you, every day  
If I may (If I may)  
And dream dreams of you, every night  
If I might (If I might)  
And if I may, I'd like to say  
I wish that you were mine  
If I had you, all I would do  
Is adore you all of the time  
  
I'd like to tell you of your charms  
Every day, if I may  
I'd like to hold you in my arms  
Every night, if I might  
You're the object of my affections  
And if you have no objections  
I'd like to love you, night and day  
If I may

The stars would cry in the blue if you said no  
Their tears would fall like the dew if you said no  
The fragrance of the flowers would fade if you turned away  
And the warmth of the summer day would leave me so cold  
  
So hold me close in your arms and don't say no  
And never ask me to leave, how could I go?  
The countless stars in the heavens are trembling above  
So don't say no, I beg of you, don't say no to my love  
  
The countless stars in the heavens are trembling above  
So don't say no, I beg of you, don't say no to my love

Are you an illusion that I've kissed?  
Am I only dreaming you exist?  
Am I just pretending dreams come true?  
And is heaven wise opening my eyes  
To someone like you?  
  
Are you an illusion I embrace?  
Can you be the rainbow that I chase?  
Want you in this yearning that I feel  
Tell me that it's so, what I want to know  
Tell me that you're real  
  
Are you an illusion I embrace?  
Can you be the rainbow that I chase?  
Want you in this yearning that I feel  
Tell me that it's so, what I want to know  
Tell me that you're real

I'm just a shy guy,  
My, I'm a 'fraid-to-try guy  
No lie.  
There's a gal that I idolize  
But I just can't seem to hypnotize.  
And when she pets me,  
You betcha, it gets me.  
And everytime I hold her hand,  
I'm just too shy to say the things I plan.  
Everytime she's close to me,  
My heart is filled with ecstasy,  
And like a dope, I let the chance slip by.  
There, I should have told her then  
But all I did was sit and grin,  
And I ended up so mad that I could cry.  
'Cause I'm a shy guy  
Wish I was a sly guy  
Then I could say, "Baby, baby, I love you"  
Just like those guys in moving pictures all do.  
I'm just a shy guy  
Wish I was a sly guy  
Then I could say, "Baby, baby, I love you"  
Just like those guys in moving pictures all do

I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
I'm gonna write words oh, so sweet  
They're gonna knock me off of my feet  
A lot of kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I got 'em  
  
I'm gonna smile and say  
"I hope you're feeling better"  
And close with love, the way that you do  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe that it came from you  
I'm gonna write words oh, so sweet, yeah!  
  
Lotta kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I got 'em  
I'm gonna smile and say  
"I hope you're feeling better"  
And close with love, the way that you do  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you...  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came  
Make believe that it came from you!

I'm through with love,  
I'll never fall again,  
Said adieu to love,  
Don't ever call again,  
For I must have you or no one,  
That's why I'm through with love.  
  
I've locked my heart,  
I keep my feelings there.  
I have stocked my heart like an icy Frigidaire,  
For I need to care for no one,  
That's why I'm through with love.  
  
Why did you lead me to think that you cared?  
You didn't need me,  
For you had your share  
Of slaves around you to hound you and swear,  
Their deep devotion emotion, to you  
  
Goodbye to spring,  
And all it meant to me,  
It could never bring the things that used to be,  
For I must have you or no one,  
That's why I'm through with love.  
That's why I'm through with love  
  
Goodbye to spring,  
And all it meant to me,  
It could never bring the things that used to be,  
For I must have you or no one,  
And so I'm through with love.

Many a tear has to fall but it's all in the game  
All in the wonderful game that we know as love  
You had words with him and your future's looking dim  
But these things your heart can't rise above.  
  
Once in a while we won't call but it's all in the game  
Soon he'll be there at your side with a sweet bouquet  
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away.  
  
And he'll kiss your lips and caress your waiting fingertips  
And your heart will fly away

It is only a paper moon  
Sailing over a cardboard sea,  
But it wouldn't be make believe  
If you believed in me.  
  
It is only a canvas sky  
Hanging over a muslin tree,  
But it wouldn't be make believe  
If you believed in me.  
  
Without your love,  
It's a honky-tonk parade.  
Without your love,  
It's a melody played in a penny arcade.  
  
It's a Barnum and Bailey world,  
Just as phony as it can be,  
But it wouldn't be make believe  
If you believed in me.

Joy to the world  
The Lord is come  
Let earth receive her King  
Let every heart prepare him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven, and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the earth  
The Saviour reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks, hills and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
  
He rules the earth  
With truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of his righteousnes  
And wonders of his love  
And wonders of his love  
And wonders, and wonders of his love

It was just one of those things  
Just one of those crazy flings  
One of those bells that now and then rings  
Just one of those things  
  
It was just one of those nights  
Just one of those fabulous flights  
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings  
Just one of those things  
  
If we'd thought of it 'bout the end of it  
When we started painting the town  
We'd have been aware that our love affair  
Was too hot not to cool down  
  
So goodbye, dear, and Amen  
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then  
It was great fun  
But it was just one of those things  
  
Just one of those bells that now and then rings  
Just one of those things  
A trip to the moon on gossamer wings  
Just one of those things

So goodbye, dear, and Amen  
Here's hoping we'll meet now and then  
It was great fun  
But it was just, just one of those things

The crowd sees me out dancing  
Carefree and romancing  
Happy with my someone new  
I'm laughing on the outside  
Crying on the inside  
'Cause I'm still in love with you  
They see me night and daytime  
Having such a gay time  
They don't know what I go through  
I'm laughing on the outside  
Crying on the inside  
'Cause I'm still in love with you  
No one knows it's just a pose  
Pretending I'm glad we're apart  
And when I cry, my eyes are dry  
The tears are in my heart  
My darling, can't we make up?  
Ever since our breakup  
Make believe is all I do  
I'm laughing on the outside  
Crying on the inside  
'Cause I'm still in love  
I am still in love with you  

Let me tell you, babe  
You got me crazy  
You got your head in  
Those big white clouds  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You got me crazy  
You don't know, girl  
What life's all about  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You must be dreaming  
The world ain't spinning  
Just for you alone  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You must be dreaming  
'Cause it's rough, girl  
Out there on your own  
  
And love that's worth your salt  
Don't grow on trees  
It won't show upon  
Every breeze that blows  
  
It beats me, honey  
How your eyes don't see  
They just don't see what's  
Right in front of your nose  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You just ain't thinking  
The grass ain't greener  
On that side of town  
  
Let me tell you, babe  
You know I need you  
If you stay, girl  
I won't let you down  
  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
If you stay, girl  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
I won't let you down  
  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
If you stay, girl  
(Let me tell you, babe)  
I won't let you down

There may be trouble ahead,  
But while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,  
Let's face the music and dance.  
  
Before the fiddlers have fled,  
Before they ask us to pay the bill,  
And while we still have the chance,  
Let's face the music and dance.  
  
Soon, we'll be without the moon,  
Humming a different toon,  
And then, there may be tear drops to shed.  
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,  
Let's face the music and dance.  
Let's face the music and dance,  
  
Soon, we'll be without the moon,  
Humming a different toon,  
And then, there may be tear drops to shed.  
So while there's moonlight and music and love and romance,  
Let's face the music and dance,  
Let's face the music and dance.

Love Affair  
By Nat King Cole  
Album:  
  
Our love affair is a wonderous thing  
That we'll rejoice in remembering  
Our love was born with out first embrace  
And a page was torn out of time and space  
  
Our love affair  
May it always be  
A flame to burn through eternity  
So take my hand  
With a reverent prayer  
That we may live  
And we may share  
A love affair to remember  
  
So take my hand  
With a reverent prayer  
That we may live  
And we may share  
A love affair to remember

Lost April  
Where did you go?  
Like winter's snow  
I saw you vanish  
Lost April  
so soft and warm  
a memory not even time can vanish  
  
Lost April  
that taught me this  
a single kiss  
could lead to heaven  
but April had numbered days  
so when they passed  
love couldn't last  
I lost love and you and April too.  
  
strings  
  
so when they passed  
love couldn't last  
I lost love and you and April too.

Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
She is sorry to be delayed,  
But last evening down at lovers lane, she strayed  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
When she woke from her dream  
And found that her love had gone  
Madam...  
She ran to the man  
Who had led her so far astray  
  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today  
  
Then the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail  
Madam...  
They strung her upon  
A willow across the way  
  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried  
Madam...  
Miss Otis regrets  
She's unable to lunch today

(I miss you)  
(Since you went away dear)  
Miss you  
More than I can say dear  
  
Daytime  
Night-time nothing I do  
Can make me forget  
That I still love you  
  
(Miss you)  
In my dreams I kiss you  
Whispering  
Darling how I miss you  
  
Tell me  
Do you ever miss me?  
As I...  
Miss... you...  
  
(Kiss you)  
In my dreams I kiss you  
Whispering  
Darling how I miss you  
  
Tell me  
Do you ever miss me?  
As I...  
Miss... you...

Mona Lisa, Mona Lisa, men have named you  
You're so like the lady with the mystic smile  
Is it only 'cause you're lonely they have blamed you?  
For that Mona Lisa strangeness in your smile?  
  
Do you smile to tempt a lover, Mona Lisa?  
Or is this your way to hide a broken heart?  
Many dreams have been brought to your doorstep  
They just lie there and they die there  
Are you warm, are you real, Mona Lisa?  
Or just a cold and lonely lovely work of art?

More  
Than the greatest love the world  
Has known,  
  
This  
Is the love I'll give to you  
Alone.  
  
More  
Than the simple words  
I've tried to say,  
I'll only live to love you  
More each day.  
  
More than you'll ever know,  
My arms long to hold you so.  
My life will be in your keeping,  
Waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping  
  
Longer  
Than always is a long, long time,  
But far beyond forever,  
You'll be mine.  
I know I've never lived before,  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more.  
  
I know I've never lived before,  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else could love you more.

My dream sonata is the music I hear  
Each night when all the world is deep in slumber  
And in my dreams, my darling, you appear.  
While the music's playing I hear you say,  
"I love you, I love you."  
  
My dream sonata has the beauty of prayer,  
A prayer my lonely heart has set to music,  
That when I wake, my darling, you'll be there.  
But when I awaken, you're gone, it seems.  
Like my sonata, you are only in my dreams.

Is it wrong wanting you  
Wanting you as I do?  
Then my one sin in life  
Is wanting you  
  
Is it wrong to desire  
Lips that set me on fire?  
Then my one sin in life  
Is wanting you  
  
You're my temptation  
My heaven, my bliss  
I never knew love  
Could thrill me like this  
  
So, if it's wrong loving you  
Heart and soul as I do  
Then my one sin in life  
Is loving you  
  
You're my temptation  
My heaven, my bliss  
I never knew love  
Could thrill be like this  
  
So, if it's wrong loving you  
Heart and soul as I do  
Then my one sin in life  
Is loving you

There was a boy  
A very strange enchanted boy  
They say he wandered very far, very far  
Over land and sea  
A little shy and sad of eye  
But very wise was he  
  
And then one day  
A magic day he passed my way  
And while we spoke of many things  
Fools and kings  
This he said to me  
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn  
Is just to love and be loved in return"  
  
"The greatest thing you'll ever learn  
Is just to love and be loved in return"

Never let me go  
Love me much too much  
If you let me go  
Life will lose its touch  
What would I be without you?  
There's no place for me without you  
  
Never let me go  
I'd be so lost if you went away  
There'd be a thousand hours in a day without you  
I know  
  
Because of one caress my world was overturned  
at the very start  
All my bridges burned by my flaming heart  
You'd never leave me would you?  
You couldn't hurt me could you?  
  
Never let me go  
Never let me go

Night lights, those blues-in-the-night lights  
Are no longer bright lights since I'm without you  
Sweet dreams, oh where did they fly to?  
You're gone and who can I cry to?  
  
Those night lights remind me of bright eyes  
And beautiful white lies too good to be true  
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray  
That those night lights will lead me to you  
  
Those night lights remind me of bright eyes  
And beautiful white lies too good to be true  
As I go on my way with all my heart I pray  
That those night lights will lead me to you

The earth may change from Summer green to Winter white  
The brightest day can change into the darkest night.  
A grey cloud may change a sky of blue  
But nothing ever changes my love for you  
  
A gentle breeze can blow into a hurricane  
A happy song can change into a sad refrain  
The oak leaf will fall when autumns through  
But nothing ever changes my love for you  
  
Time will alter Gibraltor the seas may run dry  
But you'll see that we'll be the same you and I  
A million things are bound to change as time goes on  
A million springs will come and go and when there gone  
My darling the thrill will still be new  
For nothing ever changes my love for you.  
  
My darling the thrill will still be new  
For nothing ever changes my love for you  
For nothing ever changes my love for you.

I can't stop you  
So go your way  
If that makes you happy  
I've nothing to say  
  
But nothing goes up  
No, nothing goes up  
Without coming down  
  
I'm hurting now  
Cause you're leaving  
But I know that someday  
I won't be grieving  
  
Cause nothing goes up  
No, nothing goes up  
Without coming down  
  
So, darling, please think  
Before you leap  
Remember what you sow  
So shall you reap  
  
Please be careful  
In all you do  
What's happening to me  
Could happen to you  
  
Cause nothing goes up  
No, nothing goes up  
Without coming right on down

If I owned Aladdin's lamp  
I'd make all your dreams come true  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
If I owned a magic clock  
Then I'd keep our love brand new  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
Don't ever doubt my feelings  
My love is real  
My darling, I'm revealing  
Exactly how I feel  
  
If I owned a magic wand  
I'd wave it for no one but you  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do  
  
My darling, I'm revealing  
Exactly how I feel  
  
If I owned a magic wand  
I'd wave it for no one but you  
But nothing in the world  
Could make me love you  
More than I do

Oh, Holy Night  
The stars  
Are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear  
Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world in sin  
And error pining  
'Til He appeared  
And the soul felt  
It's worth a thrill of hope  
The weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new  
And glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angel voices  
  
Oh, night divine  
Oh, night  
When Christ was born

When Christ was born  
Oh, night divine  
Oh, night  
Oh, Holy night

Red sails in the sunset, way out on the sea  
Oh, carry my loved one home safely to me  
She sailed at the dawning, all day I've been blue  
Red sails in the sunset, I'm trusting in you  
  
Swift wings you must borrow  
Make straight for the shore  
We marry tomorrow  
And she goes sailing no more

Red sails in the sunset  
Way out on the sea (ooh-wee-ooh, wee-ooh)  
Oh, carry my loved one  
Home safely to me

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way  
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Say it isn't so...  
Say it isn't so.  
Everyone is saying you don't love me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
Everywhere I go,  
Everyone I know  
Whispers that you're growing tired of me,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say that you  
Found somebody new,  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Say it isn't true.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.  
  
People say passing by  
Say he's younger than I  
And it won't be long before you leave me,  
Tell me it's a lie.  
  
Say that everything is still okay,  
That's all I want to know.  
And what they're saying,  
Say it isn't so.

When you want  
A true lover  
Send for me...send for me!

Send for me...send for me!  
  
Anytime just tell me

Don't worry.

Send for me...send for me!  
  
A-mornin', noon and night,  
In the early bright,

Raise a hair,  
I'm gonna share  
Your every care.

Anything  
That upsets you  
Send for me...send for me!  
I'll be there  
To protect you  
Wait and see...wait and see!  
Don't delay  
Right away  
Send for me...send for me.  
  
It's gonna be  
Twiddle-deee  
Yes sirree  
You and me  
Faithfully  
Send for me

What good is a dream,  
A plan or a scheme,  
The rainbow that you pursue?  
Its everything, and its nothing  
Without someone to tell it to.  
  
How eager you are  
To get to that star,  
But after the journeys through,  
You're only a lonely dreamer  
Without someone to tell it to.  
  
There'll be blue days,  
Hard to get through days,  
Days when you'll just want to die.  
Soon you're older,  
And the worlds colder,  
When there's no shoulder to cry on.  
  
Castles in air  
Are empty and bare  
With no one to share the view.  
The moonlight is merely moonlight,  
There's no magic in I love you  
Without someone  
Someone to tell it to.  
  
The moonlight is merely moonlight,  
There's no magic in I love you  
Without someone  
Someone to tell it to.

Simple melodies become enchanting symphonies  
When you're with someone you love  
Starlit summer nights can hold a thousand new delights  
When you're with someone you love  
Every little flower seems to blossom by the hour  
With some rare perfume  
She can touch your hand and make a palace of a tiny room  
Happy things are gladder even sad things so much sadder  
When there's someone you love  
You can climb the ladder of romance  
And reach the stars above  
And when you've quarreled and vowed you would end it  
How sweet it is when you mend it  
You're just not you without  
Can't do without that someone you love

I used to walk with you  
Along the avenue  
Our hearts were carefree and gay  
How could I know I'd lose you  
Somewhere along the way?  
  
The friends we used to know  
Would always smile "Hello"  
No love like our love they'd say  
Then love slipped through our fingers  
Somewhere along the way  
  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything  
You're gone and yet  
There's still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be part of me  
  
So now I look for you  
Along the avenue  
And as I wander I pray  
That some day soon I'll find you  
Somewhere along the way  
  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering ev'rything  
You're gone and yet  
There's still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be part of me  
  
So now I look for you  
Along the avenue  
And as I wander I pray  
That some day soon I'll find you  
Somewhere along the way  
Somewhere along the way

Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?  
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?  
No desire, no ambition leads me  
Maybe it's because nobody needs me  
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?  
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?  
Maybe it's because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear  
  
Spring is here! Why doesn't my heart go dancing?  
Spring is here! Why isn't the waltz entrancing?  
No desire, no ambition leads me  
Maybe it's because nobody needs me  
Spring is here! Why doesn't the breeze delight me?  
Stars appear, why doesn't the night invite me?  
Maybe it's because nobody loves me  
Spring is here I hear

And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
Steals across the meadows of my heart  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wander down the lane and far away  
Leaving me a song that will not die  
Love is now the stardust of yesterday  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
The lonely night dreaming of a song  
The melody haunts my reverie  
And I am once again with you  
When our love was new  
And each kiss an inspiration  
But that was long ago  
Now my consolation  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside a garden wall  
When stars are bright  
You are in my arms  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
A paradise where roses bloom  
Though I dream in vain  
In my heart it will remain  
My stardust melody  
The memory of love's refrain

Stay in my heart where I lead you  
Stay where a kiss won't mislead you  
Don't ever think of going far  
You'll have me following where you are  
  
Stay where my arms can reach for you  
Close to the lips that adore you  
And even though it's time to go  
You'll like it better if you stay  
  
Don't ever think of going far  
You'll have me following where you are  
  
Stay where my arms can reach for you  
Close to the lips that adore you  
And even though it's time to go  
You'll like it better if you stay  
You'll like it better if you stay

Don't know why  
There's no sun up in the sky  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps raining all the time  
  
Life is bare  
Gloom and misery everywhere  
Stormy weather  
Just can't get my poor old self together  
I'm weary all the time, the time  
So weary all of the time  
  
When he went away  
The blues walked in and met me  
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me  
All I do is pray  
The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more  
  
Can't go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps raining all the time  
Keeps raining all of the time  
  
I walk around,  
Heavy-hearted and sad  
Night comes around  
And I'm still feeling bad  
Rain pourin' down  
Blinding every hope I had  
This pitter 'n patter 'n beatin' 'n spatterin' drivin' me mad  
  
Love, love, love, love  
This misery will be the end of me  
  
When he went away  
The blues walked in and met me  
If he stays away, old rocking chair will get me  
All I do is pray  
The lord above will let me  
Walk in the sun once more  
  
Can't go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps raining all the time, the time  
Keeps raining all the time

The buzzard took the monkey for a ride in the air  
The monkey thought that everything was on the square  
The buzzard tried to throw the monkey off his back  
The monkey grabbed his neck and said "now listen, jack"  
  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
"ain't no use in jivin' "  
"what's the use in dabbin' "  
"straighten up and fly right"  
"cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
  
The buzzard told the monkey "you're chokin' me"  
"release your hold and I'll set you free"  
The monkey looked the buzzard right dead in the eye and said  
"your story's fetchin' but it sounds like a lie"  
  
"straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."  
  
"straighten up and fly right  
Straighten up and do right  
Straighten up and fly right  
Cool down, papa, don't you blow your top."

The Sweet Bird Of Youth  
Nat King Cole  
The sweet bird of youth soon flies away  
And nothing can make him stay?  
The sweet bird of youth soothes us his sound  
To waste precious time is wrong  
So come to my arms,  
We?re young but we?ll learn  
That lips unkissed like moments missed  
Can never return  
How sad is the truth?try though we may  
The sweet bird of youth flies away  
The sweet bird of youth flies away  

He just got here yesterday,  
Things are hot here now they say,  
There's a new gal in town.  
Gals are jealous, there's no doubt.  
All the guys just rave about  
Sweet, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
And ever since she came, the common folks all claim, say  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,  
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).  
It's been said she knocks 'em dead when she lands in town.  
Since she came why it's a shame how she's cooled 'em down.  
Fellas that she can't get must be fellas that she ain't met.  
Georgia claimed her, Georgia named her, Sweet Georgia Brown.  
  
All you gals will get the blues,  
All you pals will surely lose.  
And, there's but one excuse.  
Now I've told you who she was,  
And I've told you what she does,  
Still, give this gal her dues.  
This pretty maiden's prayer is answered anywhere  
  
No gal made has got a shade on Sweet Georgia Brown.  
Two left feet, but oh, so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown.  
They all sigh and wanna die for Sweet Georgia Brown,  
I'll tell you just why, you know I don't lie (not much!).  
All those tips the porter slips to Sweet Georgia Brown  
They buy clothes at fashion shows for one dollar down.  
Fellas, won'tcha tip your hats oh boy, ain't she the cats?  
Who's that mister, ain't her sister, it's Sweet Georgia Brown.

If you love her  
And she makes one mistake,  
Please don't leave her  
It would make your heart ache.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
If you need her  
But you're letting her go,  
Please don't do it  
You'll be sorry, I know.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
Truly,  
She's caused you to doubt her,  
Truly,  
She's broken the rules.  
But life's not worth living without her,  
So listen to the wisdom of a fool.  
  
Think it over  
And forgive her this time,  
I was foolish  
I lost the love that was mine.  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  
  
Take a fool's advice,  
Don't pay the price I had to pay.  

(Please, take me back  
Please, take me back  
To Toyland, Toyland)  
  
Please, take me back to Toyland  
Everyone's happy there  
It's more than a girl and boy land  
Where dreams just like  
Toys can be shared  
  
If you believe in Toyland (Toyland)  
Believe in things that you cannot see  
All the world would become a joy land  
What a wonderful world this would be
