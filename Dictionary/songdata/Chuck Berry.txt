There was Adam  
Happy as a man could be  
'Til Eve got him messing  
With that old apple tree  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
Lot took his wife  
Down to the corner for a malted  
She wouldn't mind her business  
Boy, did she get salted  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
Samson thought Delilah  
Was on the square  
'Til one night  
She clipped him all his hair  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
From our history books  
We all learned  
Nero fiddled  
While Rome was burned  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
Marie Antoinette met  
Some hungry cats at the gate  
They was crying for bread  
She said, "Let them eat cake"  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  
You can buy a woman clothes  
And give her money on the side  
No matter what you do  
She ain't never satisfied  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
Ain't that just like a woman?  
They'll do it every time  

Yeah 'n' I'm doin' all right in school.  
They ain't said I broke no rule.  
I ain't never been in Dutch.  
I don't browse around too much  
  
Don't bother me, leave me alone  
Anyway I'm almost grown  
  
I don't run around with no mob.  
Got myself a little job  
I'm gonna buy me a little car,  
Drive my girl in the park  
  
Got my eye on a little girl.  
Ah, she's really out of this world.  
When I take her to the dance,  
She's got to talk about romance.  
  
You know I'm still livin' in town.  
But I done married and settled down.  
Now I really have a ball  
So I don't browse around at all

They say the joint was rockin'  
A goin' 'round and round  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
Well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Oh it sounds so sweet I gotta take me a chance  
Rose out of my seat just had to dance  
Started movin' my feet well a clappin' my hands  
Well the joint started  
  
Rockin' going 'round and around  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Twelve o'clock  
Well the place as packed  
Front doors was locked  
Well the place was packed  
When the police knocked  
Both doors flew back  
But they kept on a  
  
Oh they kept on a  
Rockin' going 'round and around  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down

I've been struggling up here, child, trying to make a living  
Everybody wants to take, nobody like giving  
I wish I was in Memphis back home there with my Mama  
The only clothes I got left that ain't rags is my pajamas  
No brotherly love, no help, no danger  
Just a great big town full of cold hearted strangers  
I went hungry in New York and Chicago was no better  
But today, my dear mother wrote and told me in her letter  
Son, come back to Memphis and live here with your Mama  
You can walk down Beale Street, honey, wearing your pajamas  
You know home folks here, we let do just what you want to  
And I born you and raised you right here on the corner  
I'm going to leave here in the morning and walk down to the station  
I've got just enough money to pay my transportation  
I'm going back to Memphis, back home with my Mama  
If I have to ride that bus barefooted in pajamas  
Back home in Memphis, no moaning and groaning  
I know everything will be all right in the morning  
  

Beautiful Delilah, sweet as apple pie  
Always gets a second look from fellas passin' by  
Every time you see her she's with a different guy  
Beautiful Delilah, that's the reason why  
  
[Chorus:]  
The better don't allow me fool around with you  
You are so tantalizing you just can't be true  
  
Beautiful Delilah, dressed in the latest style  
Swingin' like a pendulum, walkin' down the aisle  
Deep romantic eyes, speak so low in miles  
Maybe she will settle down and marry after a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Beautiful Delilah, bathin' in the sun  
An audience of 17, and notice not a one  
Local Casanova who wouldn't be outdone  
Let her steal his heart away, break it just for fun  
  
[Chorus]

I love the way you talk  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Speaking little, saying a lot.  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I love the way you walk  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Look like you're dancin when you're not.  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I love the way you love  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
You give it everything you've got.  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Chorus:  
Oh-oh-oh baby  
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)  
I'm in love with you  
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)  
Oh-oh-oh baby  
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)  
I'm in love with you  
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)  
Now tell me baby  
(Sing the song Chuckie Boy)  
Do you love me too?  
2nd verse  
Every time I knock-knock-knock  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I hear you say "Come in."  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
My heart goes a-boom-boom  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Just to hold you again.  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I hear bells ding-a-ling  
Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
'Cause you the living end  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
3rd verse!  
I bet you wouldn't think a dance  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Could start a real romance  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
I bet you wouldn't think a kiss  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Could turn me on like this  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Well let me tell you how it was  
(Oh yeah Betty Jean)  
Yes it did, Yes it was  
  

Good night, sweethearts  
It's time to go now  
Arrivederci, tally-ho, au revoir, adio  
You've been so wonderful, I don't wish to go  
But this completes my show  
  
Bonsoir, chrie, Je vous partir  
Bonsoir, chrie, Je vous partir  
Je vous aime, beaucoup chrie  
Bonsoir, chrie, bonsoir  
  
Be strong, Pierre, hang on chrie  
Avec plaisir, as you know  
It's been beautiful, it's been mellow  
That is why I don't want to go, oh no!  
  
Good night, sweetheart, I got to go now  
Time won't permit me to play no more now  
But I'll be back to do another show now  
So good night, so long, bye, bye

She drew out all her money out of the Southern Trust  
And put her little boy aboard a Greyhound Bus  
Leaving Louisiana for the Golden West  
Down came the tears from her happiness  
Her own little son name 'o Johnny B. Goode  
Was gonna make some motion pictures out in Hollywood  
  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B. Goode  
  
She remembered taking money out from gathering crop  
And buying Johnny's guitar at a broker shop  
As long as he would play it by the railroad side  
And wouldn't get in trouble he was satisfied  
But never thought that there would come a day like this  
When she would have to give her son a goodby kiss  
  
Going  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B. Goode  
  
She finally got the letter she was dreaming of  
Johnny wrote and told her he had fell in love  
As soon as he was married he would bring her back  
And build a mansion for 'em by the railroad track  
So every time they heard the locomotive roar  
They'd be a' standin', a' wavin' by the kitchen door  
  
Howling  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Bye bye Johnny  
Good bye Johnny B. Goode

California, California  
Much has been told me about your beautiful sunshine  
Mountains and snow tops, valleys and rich crops  
California, home so far from mine  
  
San Francisco, Sacramento  
Will I ever go to Los Angeles or San Diego ?  
To Reading or Fresno  
Needles or Borstow, California I have so far to go  
  
Someday I will be in California  
And go to places movie stars have been  
Hollywood and trolley cars and oranges  
And see the palm trees bending in the wind  
  
California, California  
Soon I'll be with you watching your sunset in the evening  
Movies and show plays, beaches and free ways  
California, from my home I'll be leaving  
  
California, California  
Soon I'll be with you watching your sunset in the evening  
Movies and show plays, beaches and free ways  
California, for my home I'm leaving

Everything is wrong since me and my baby parted  
All day long I'm walkin' 'cause I couldn't get my car started  
Laid off from job and I can't afford to check it  
I wish somebody'd come along and run in to it and wreck it  
  
Come on, since my baby parted, come on  
I can't get started, Come on  
I can't afford to check it  
I wish somebody'd come along and run into it and wreck it  
  
Everything is wrong since I been without you  
Every night I lay awake thinkin' about you  
Everytime the phone rings sounds like thunder  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number  
  
Come on, since I been without you, Come on  
Steady thinkin' 'bout you, Come on  
Phone sounds like thunder  
Some stupid jerk tryin' to reach another number  
  
Everything is wrong since I last saw you baby  
I really want to see you and I don't mean maybe  
I'm doin' everything tryin' to make you see  
That I belong to you honey and you belong to me  
  
So come on, I want to see you baby, Come on  
I don't mean maybe, Come on  
I'm tryin' to make you see that I belong to you and you belong to me  
Come on

Baby here I stand before you  
With my heart in my hand  
I put it to you mama  
Hoping that you'll understand  
  
Oh, baby  
Mama, please don't dog me 'round  
Yeah I, I would rather love you, baby  
Than anyone else I know in town  
  
This is my confession, Mama  
And it's sung by all your song  
It proves that I'm in heaven, Mama  
When you hold me in your arms  
  
Well, baby  
Can I have you for myself  
Yeah, if I can't have you, baby  
I don't want nobody else  
  
Well, baby  
Don't you want a man like me  
Well, baby  
Don't you want a man like me  
Yeah, think about your future, baby  
Forget about your used to be

Blue, ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And a storm is brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream now I know that is real  
You're someone else's love now you're not mine  
Crazy arms that reach to hold someone new  
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
And that is why I'm lonely all the time  
  
So please take the treasured dreams that I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday my crazy arms may old someone new  
Right now I'm so lonely all the time  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold someone new  
For my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
And that is why I'm lonely all the time

A stranger lying on a bar room floor  
Had drank so much he could drink no more,  
And so he fell asleep with a troubled brain  
To dream that he rode on that down bound train.  
  
The engine with blood was sweaty and damp  
And brilliantly lit with a brimstone lamp,  
And imps for fuel was shovelling bones  
While the furnace rang with a thousand groans.  
  
The boiler was filled with lots of beer  
The devil himself was the engineer,  
The passengers were most a motley crew,  
Some were foreigners and others he knew.  
  
Rich men and lost beggars in rags  
Handsome young ladies and wicked old hags.  
As the train rushed on at a terrible pace  
Sulphuric fumes scorched their hands and face,  
  
Wider and wider the country grew  
Faster and faster the engine flew,  
Louder and louder the thunder crashed  
Brighter and brighter the lighting flashed,  
  
Hotter and hotter the air became  
Til their clothes were burned with each quivering refrain.  
Then out of the din there came a yell  
Ha ha said the devil we're nearing home,  
  
Oh how the passengers shrieked with pain  
They go to Satan with this down bound train.  
The stranger awoke with an anguished cry  
His clothes wet with sweat and his hair standing high,  
  
He fell on his knees on the bar room floor  
And prayed a prayer like never before.  
And the prayers and vows were not in vain  
For he never rode that down bound train.

Who set my heart  
Ever - drifting?  
You, from the start never lifting  
I fight it but it downs me  
Despite the joy around me  
I can't free myself from sorrow  
All through the day it's a wonder  
Fall will the night, still I wonder  
If I'm the only  
Or are you as lonely  
Come home to me tomorrow  
Why should the past so change  
How you feel!  
Oh but I ask you  
"Forgive, if you will"  
These lonely hours are  
So hard to bear  
I don't deny that I was unfair  
You paid enough to be gay  
Who made me love you this way?  
So give me the chance  
To renew our romance  
For this time I know it will stay  
Oh yes, this time I know it will stay  
  

Every day, every day I have the blues,  
Every day, every day I have the blues,  
When you see me worried, baby, because it's you I hate to lose.  
  
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care,  
Nobody loves me, nobody seems to care,  
Speaking of bad luck and trouble will you know I,ve had my share.  
  
I'm gonna pack my suitcase, move on down the line,  
I'm gonna pack my suitcase, moving down the line,  
Well, there ain't nobody worryin' and there ain't nobody cryin'.  
Seems to me every day, every day I have the blues,  
Every day, every day I have the blues.

Every day we're gonna rock and roll  
Rock and roll, rock and roll  
Every day we're gonna rock and roll, gonna  
Rock out a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna go, go, go  
Gonna kick off the shoes and dance on the floor  
Every day we're gonna go, go, go, gonna  
Go, go, a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna twist and shout  
Hold back, baby, come on, work out  
Every day we're gonna twist and shout, gonna  
Twist and shout a little soul  
  
Every day we're gonna shake, shake, shake  
Come on, Grandpa, you ain't got no back ache  
Every day we're gonna shake, shake, shake, gonna  
Shake a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna turn it on  
Gonna turn it on, gonna turn it on  
Every day we're gonna turn it on, gonna  
Turn on a little bit of soul  
  
Every day we're gonna rock and roll  
'Round the clock, rock and roll  
Every day we're gonna rock and roll, gonna  
Rock out a little bit of soul

Havin' a nationwide festival for fourteen days and nights  
Ah, there's fifty four bands on a river boat spot in the lights  
Hundred of bands and tents all on the banks of the Ohio  
Bandstands floatin' from Paducah to Cairo  
Be over a million freaks there diggin' the sights  
  
There's so many beautiful people there to love and cheer  
Some of the greatest guitar playin' in the western hemisphere  
Got the Who, the Band from across the north border Canned Heat  
The Fifth Dimension, Creedence Clearwater  
Oh, brother Hendrix, sister Joplin, we wish you were here  
  
Early in the mornin' Johnny Cash and old Elvis got loose  
The Who, Vanilla Fudge and the Woolies start paying their dues  
All evening Ike Turner and Aretha right on the Drifters  
And the Coasters and the Loading Zone  
All night Howlin' Wolf and Muddy Waters in a battlin' mood  
  
Oh, what a beautiful show, was sitting right up under the microphone  
Diggin' the Grateful Dead, Little Richard and the Rolling Stones  
Ray Charles, Led Zeppelin and the Everly Brothers  
Bad Bo Diddley and the Beatles and some others  
Everybody's laying back and freaking out all week long

Fish and Chips  
A little coke and you, oh, babe  
Honey drips  
Two more to go, oh, babe  
Let's go on back  
The trip will be groovy, oh, babe  
Jump in the sack  
Flip your mood, oh, babe  
Come to me  
I really do love you, oh, babe  
Honey, honey  
Honey dripper too, oh, babe  
Loved you before  
I loved you a long, long time, my love  
Loving you more  
Then I got to have more of  
Fish and chips  
  

Far across the deep blue water lives an old captain's daughter  
On the banks of the old river Rhine  
Where I loved her and I left her and now I can't forget her  
'Cause she is my pretty Fraulein  
  
Fraulein, Fraulein walk down by the river  
Each night when the stars began to shine  
By these same stars above you I swear that I love you  
You are my pretty Fraulein  
  
When my memory start to wander  
Each day I grow fonder of the sweetheart that I left behind  
In a moment of my glory her face comes before me  
The face of my pretty Fraulein  
  
Fraulein, Fraulein look up toward the heaven  
Pretend that your hand is holdin' mine  
By the same stars above you I swear I still love you  
And I always will my Fraulein

Bobby band a-rockin'  
And the bobby soxer's doing the twist  
It's a bobby soxer beat  
And you can rock it any way you wish  
Work out, bobby soxer, you can  
Wiggle like a whimsical fish  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
Go, go, bobby soxer  
When the weekend comes  
You'll be right back rockin' some more  
Bobby soxer dancin'  
But she keeps peepin' on the stand  
Bobby soxer's got a crush  
On a beatle in the bobby band  
Love bug sure gonna bite her  
If the beatle even wave his hand  
Twist on, bobby soxer  
But don't forget the bobby rule  
It's getting late, bobby soxer  
And the teacher teachin' you in school  
And tomorrow morning, bobby soxer  
You'll be back in school  
  

Well, you're a good looking woman  
Any man would go for you  
You got everything you need, darling  
Yeah, you know how to use it too  
If you let me be your love one  
I'll do anything you wish me to do  
I'd be true to you, baby  
And I would not mess around  
You make me so happy, darling  
Take you anyplace in town  
Yes, I belong to you alone  
Until you put me down  
I'm gonna try for your love, baby  
In ev'ry way I know how  
I'm gonna tweet, tweet, tweet  
Gobble, gobble or meow, meow  
I'll even quack, quack, quack or moo, moo  
Or bow, wow, wow, wow  
Yeah, I'm hung up on you, baby  
You're a fox and I ain't lying  
Ooh, the things I'll do for you  
Let me love you, I'll blow your mind  
Till that satisfaction comes  
I'll be stone lie steady trying  
  

When I was a little biddy boy  
My grandmother bought me a cute little toy  
Silver bells hanging on a string  
She told me it was my ding-a-ling-a-ling  
  
My Ding-A-Ling My Ding-A-Ling I want you to play with My Ding-A-Ling  
My Ding-A-Ling My Ding-A-Ling I want you to play with My Ding-A-Ling  
  
Then mama took me to Grammar school  
But I stopped off in the vestibule  
Every time that bell would ring  
Catch me playing with my ding-a-ling  
  
Once I was climbing the garden wall,  
I slipped and had a terrible fall  
I fell so hard I heard bells ring,  
But held on to My ding-a-ling  
  
Once I was swimming cross turtle creek  
Man them snappers all around my feet  
Sure was hard swimming cross that thing  
With both hands holding my ding-a-ling  
  
This here song it ain't so sad  
The cutest little song you ever had  
Those of you who will not sing  
You must be playing with your own Ding-a-ling

Now darling, you should know  
That I'm really, really in love with you  
Although you don't belong to me, darling  
My heart will always belong to you  
There are many, many things all around me  
That will always remind me of you  
I know I'll never forget you darling  
My heart will always belong to you  
Since you've been gone, darling  
Life for me has been so blue  
I guess I'll have to go it alone  
Because my heart will always belong to you  
Although, although I cannot see you  
I could never, never stop lovin' you  
I just hope and pray you'll come back to me, darling  
'Cause my heart will always belong to you  
  

This little love-light of mine are you gonna let it shine  
This little love-light of mine are you gonna let it shine  
This little love-light of mine are you gonna let it shine  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine  
  
With your arms wrapped around me my little love-light will shine  
With your arms wrapped around me my little love-light will shine  
With your arms wrapped around me my little love-light will shine  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine  
  
Someday soon you promised me you'd make my love-light shine  
Someday soon you promised me you'd make my love-light shine  
Someday soon you promised me you'd make my love-light shine  
With a kiss, your arms around me, make it shine  
  
Wee, wee hours come and let my love-light shine  
In the wee, wee hours let my lil' love-light shine  
In the wee, wee hours let my lil' love-light shine  
Let it shine, let it shine, let it shine

Riding along in my automobile  
My baby beside me at the wheel  
I stole a kiss at the turn of a mile  
My curiosity runnin' wild  
Crusin' and playin' the radio  
With no particular place to go  
  
Riding along in my automobile  
I was anxious to tell her the way I feel  
So I told her softly and sincere  
And she leaned and whispered in my ear  
Cuddlin' more and drivin' slow  
With no particular place to go  
  
No particular place to go  
So we parked way out on the Kokomo  
The night was young and the moon was gold  
So we both decided to take a stroll  
Can you image the way I felt  
I couldn't unfasten her safety belt  
  
Ridin' along in my calaboose  
Still trying to get her belt a-loose  
All the way home I held a grudge  
For the safety belt that wouldn't budge  
Crusin' and playin' the radio  
With no particular place to go

Oh baby doll!  
When bells ring out the summer free  
Oh baby doll  
Will it end for you and me?  
We'll sing our old Alma Mater  
And think of things that used to be  
  
I remember it so well  
Back when the weather was cool  
We used to have so much fun  
When we were walking to school  
If we stopped off to hear  
The latest songs they sing  
And we just make it in  
Before the bells would ring  
  
Oh baby doll!  
When bells ring out the summer free  
Oh baby doll  
Will it end for you and me?  
We'll sing our old Alma Mater  
And think of things that used to be  
  
When the teacher was gone  
That's when we'd have a ball  
We use to dance and play  
All up and down the hall  
We had a portable radio  
We was ballin' the jack  
We'd be all back in order  
When the teacher got back  
  
Oh baby doll!  
When bells ring out the summer free  
Oh baby doll  
Will it end for you and me?  
We'll sing our old Alma Mater  
And think of things that used to be

Oh, Louisiana, I stayed away from you too long  
Oh, Louisiana, how can a true love go so wrong ?  
She put me in shame and in sorrow and I come home tomorrow  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, Louisiana, yea, yea, Creole baby, Cajun queens  
Quaint porches and windows, filet de gumbo, the Basin beans  
Your beautiful Delta and bayous in greens  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, Louisiana, yea-e-e, yea, I'm flyin' on Delta Nine-o-three  
Right over St. Louis, high over Memphis, Tennessee  
On southward to the sea, where I long to be  
Oh, Louisiana  
Oh, o, Louisiana, yea, yea, them Yankee nights are cold and long  
Oh, Louisiana, she broke my heart and wrecked my home  
She shamed me in sorrow, to face my tomorrow  
Oh, take me back, oh, Louisiana  
  

Oh, well, well, well, you've blown my clouds away  
My rains have gone and my sunshine's here to stay  
And I feel so good I could really get down today  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
If you say I can stay, baby, you know I will  
I could stay here all evenin' listenin' to the music you play  
Those same sweet songs of a golden yesterday  
Squeezin' and teasin' and pleasin' the evenin' away  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
If you say I can stay, baby, you know I will  
I will wake up in the morning and do the same sweet things  
Rockin' with the record that the same sweet people sing  
All the clouds from the west go east, you confess it is spring  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
I want you to want you to love you of your own free will  
Baby, you're so beautiful to want me here to stay  
I would be here forever but I gotta die someday  
But I will be lovin' you, baby, when I pass away  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
Hollerin' yes, yes! Oh, what a thrill  
I will love you like a lover loves a lover always  
  

It's quarter to three and there's no one in the place except you and me  
So set 'em up Joe, I got a little story you ought to know  
We're drinkin' my friend on to the end of a brief episode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
I got the routine, gonna drop another quarter in this machine  
Feelin' so bad, I got to have the music dreamy and sad  
I could tell you a lot but you have got to be true to your code  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
  
Joe you'd never know it but I'm a kind of poet  
And I got a lot of things to say  
But when I'm gloomy just listen to me until it's all talked away  
  
Well, that's how it goes and Joe I know you're gettin' anxious to close  
Thanks, thanks for the cheer, hope you didn't mind my bendin' your ear  
The torch that I found must be drowned or soon might explode  
Make it one for my baby and one more for the road  
One more for the road

I left my home in Norfolk Virginia,  
California on my mind.  
Straddled that Greyhound, rode him past Raleigh,  
On across Caroline.  
  
Stopped in Charlotte and bypassed Rock Hill,  
And we never was a minute late.  
We was ninety miles out of Atlanta by sundown,  
Rollin' 'cross the Georgia state.  
  
We had motor trouble it turned into a struggle,  
Half way 'cross Alabam,  
And that 'hound broke down and left us all stranded  
In downtown Birmingham.  
  
Straight off, I bought me a through train ticket,  
Ridin' cross Mississippi clean  
And I was on that midnight flier out of Birmingham  
Smoking into New Orleans.  
  
Somebody help me get out of Louisiana  
Just help me get to Houston town.  
There's people there who care a little 'bout me  
And they won't let the poor boy down.  
  
Sure as you're born, they bought me a silk suit,  
Put luggage in my hands,  
And I woke up high over Albuquerque  
On a jet to the promised land.  
  
Workin' on a T-bone steak a la carte  
Flying over to the Golden State,  
The pilot told me in thirteen minutes  
We'd be headin' in the terminal gate.  
  
Swing low sweet chariot, come down easy  
Taxi to the terminal zone,  
Cut your engines, cool your wings,  
And let me make it to the telephone.  
  
Los Angeles give me Norfolk Virginia,  
Tidewater four ten O nine  
Tell the folks back home this is the promised land callin'  
And the poor boy's on the line.

Ramona, Ramona, Ramona, where'd you get that dress ?  
The neckline's down south, the hemline's way out west  
All in favour of Ramona's style, say yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Oh, Ramona, dancing in her brand new dress  
Ramona, you know, Ramona, you can do the monkey best  
All in favour of Ramona's monkey, say yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Ramona started shaking in her brand new short tight dress  
The band keep blasting, but Ramona, she never rest  
All in favour of Ramona, keep hollering yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
Ramona looking good in her brand new short tight dress  
Wow, Ramona, Ramona, how'd you learn that mess ?  
All in favour of Ramona, just say yes  
Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes  
  

Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't  
Sometimes I will, then again I think I won't  
Sometimes I do, then again I think I don't  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:21  
We was at a rock'n'roll dance having nothing but fun  
  
[Chorus]  
And we rolled, reelin' and a rockin'  
We was reelin' and a rockin'  
Rollin' till the break of dawn  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:32  
There's nothing I would rather do than dance with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:43  
And everytime I spinned she would spin with me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 9:54  
I said, " Dance ballerina girl, go go go!"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:05  
Man, I didn't know if I was dead or alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:26  
But I'm gonna keep on dancing toll I get my kicks  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:28  
I gotta get my kicks before it get too late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch, it was 10:29  
I had to hold her hand, she was still holding mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch and to my surprise  
I was dancing with a woman that was twice my size  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I looked at my watch and it was time to go  
The bandleader said " We ain't playing no more "  
  
[Chorus]

Way down south in Louisiana, up under the Delta heat, child  
There's an old boy plays an electric guitar right off Rampart Street  
Sometimes a Go-Go girl come in with him, she be shakin' out a Mojo beat  
That old boy sure pick some old mean guitar right off Rampart Street  
Stays crowded every time he's there, people come there from near and far  
I don't think nobody knows his name, they just know it's a Go-Go guitar  
They just know it's a Go-Go guitar  
Way down south in Louisiana, up under the Delta heat, child  
Go see that old boy play his guitar right off Rampart Street  
Right off Rampart Street  
  

I was born under the sign of Libra  
October, eighteen, seven o'clock  
I must have had it bad, 'cause in the cradle I had  
My mother said, before noon I was trying to rock  
My mother said, before noon I was trying to rock  
  
For years I tried to make A grades  
To satisfy my Mom and Pop  
In music I'm boss, but in Math, I was lost  
I guess my head was full of nothing but rock  
I guess my head was full of nothing but rock  
  
Hear they're swinging the Fox Trot at the hotel  
Hear the country picking 'round the clock  
Pick up some sounds of the jazz around  
But if you dig what you hear, you dig rock  
Ah, if you dig what you hear, you dig rock  
  
The thing I'm gon' tell my dick jock  
So he can sock it to me 'round the clock  
Spend an hour of Bach in his original rock  
And if you dig what he's playing, you dig rock  
And if you dig what he's playing, you dig rock

I hate to see that evening sun go down  
I hate to see that evening sun go down  
'Cause the woman I'm loving, she has left this town  
  
If I'm feeling tomorrow just like I feel today  
If I'm feeling tomorrow just like I feel today  
I'm gonna pack my bags and make a getaway  
  
St. Louis woman without your diamond ring  
If you didn't have good looks, you wouldn't mean a thing  
If it was not for powder and your super hair  
Without the man who loves you, you wouldn't get nowhere nowhere  
  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
You know I love you, but you don't care for me  
  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be  
You know I love you, but you don't care for me  
I got the St. Louis blues, blue as I can be

If I don't get a letter from Sue tomorrow I'm a catch the next eastbound je-

She writ back and sey, if you don't send somethin' soon

I got to get my reputation b-b-back again  
And settle down and start walkin' the ch-ch-ch-ch-chalk  
  
What be lookin' good to d'goose

Two birdies in a bush ain't worth as much as one  
Twitchin' right there in yo' h-h-hand

She writ and sey I mighty nigh b-b-b-blew it  
It won't matter which one wh-what you do  
It b-be's in the way dat you d-d-d-d-d-do it

Sweet Sixteen,  
Sweet Sixteen,  
Sweet Sixteen,  
Ah, you're the sweetest little babe  
That I've ever seen  
  
But you would not  
You would not do  
Everything that I ask you to  
Guess you ran away from your home, darling  
Now, you won't run away from me too  
  
Well, my brother is sent to Korea  
And my sister settled down in New-Orleans  
Guess my mother is up in heaven  
And now I wonder what  
Would happen to me  
  
Sweet Sixteen  
Sweet Sixteen  
Sweet Sixteen  
Sweet Sixteen  
You're the sweetest little baby  
That I ever seen

My friend finally made a record and took to the road and played guitar  
He met this girl from Pennsylvania stuck by his side in love and war  
Fearful and fussy, but so faithful, poor and devoted, real and true  
She's not the type to be forsaken and I see much of her in you  
  
While on a gig up in Toronto during a pause between his show  
He met this foxy German stallion who understood him head to toe  
She played it smart and learned his weakness and made him confess and yield
into  
Her lustful whims became his fancy and I would fear the same from you  
  
Then in the swank suburbs of Houston off in a mansion built of stone  
Escorted by this wealthy widow into her lounge and left alone  
Her maid announced that she was waiting for him to come and rendezvous  
Where he bestowed a long relation one like I hope to have with you  
  
Then on the sands right off the ocean just as the sun sank in the sea  
So did my buddy slow and easy into a freak of fancy-free  
It was a group in automation getting together two by two  
Where people live and love one another, people who live like me and you  
  
Then on the beach in warm Miami there was a teacher far from school  
Taught him the way to please a woman, made him concede the Golden Rule  
He learned to do it unto others as he used to just have them do  
So they began to come together as I will try to do with you  
  
And there was one who was a virgin, never been touched by anyone  
She was as pure as any angel, in fact she's called to be a nun  
But it was all because my buddy just couldn't spoil a girl so true  
And so he left her as he found her, like I may have to do with you  
  
The girl he's got now, he's never left her, she was the first I thought he'd
shun  
Until I saw my buddy's eyes, when she came forth and bore his son  
Since then he's known no other woman, I think his ramblin' days are through  
They built a home up in the country, a life I'd love to build with you  
  
Although you've never known my buddy and I am sure he don't know you  
But you know the life he's living and all of the changes he's been through  
Sweetheart, I'm talking about my buddy 'cause I don't want to wind up blue  
I could be happy with you only 'cause I see all of them in you

After the sun goes down in the evening  
That's when your leaving hurts me most  
The times when you would nestle to me  
And dwell within my heart so cold  
Although you stand two steps away now  
The distance seems from coast to coast  
  
I often think of when I met you  
Many times we kissed goodbye  
Sometimes I dream we are together  
Wake up moanin' your name thru sleepy eyes  
And I wanna scream that I still love you  
But you're not there, I got to realize  
  
It is now High Noon in China  
With the same stars up above  
The one I need has left me and gone now  
And all I have is a little picutre of  
The truest one I've ever known now  
Is the love I lost and still I love

The man and the donkey  
  
Down the road came a tired little donkey,  
Much he was loaded till his head hung down.  
Upon this back so heavy set a big man,  
Singin' such a sad song  
As he rode into town.  
  
And the man, the man sing to the donkey,  
But he sing such a sad song, and the guitar he broke.  
The donkey stop, the man he reach to get a big jug,  
Him and the donkey take a sip o' the drink.  
  
Down the road, oh the dancing donkey,  
Head swingin' so high, all the pain now gone.  
The man he sing, some song was a gay song,  
And the little donkey kept a-dancin' on.  
  
Down the road was the man and the donkey,  
So good feel the donkey, so gay was the man.  
How plain when the wind blow was the sound of the gay song,  
When the man and the donkey kept a-movin' on down the road.

Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
Things that I used to do  
Some I won't do no more  
  
Used to sit and hold your hand, baby  
Begging you, not today  
  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Used to search all night for you baby  
And I search always anything  
Yeah, and I'm new alone again, darlin'  
You was out somewhere with your other man  
  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
I'm gonna send you back to your mother, baby  
Or I'm gonna back to my family too  
  
Nothing I ever do pleases you, darlin'  
Or I just can't get along with you

I saw you over there  
But what could I do?  
I couldn't stand and stare  
Or come and talk to you  
And it is always fair  
To formally be introduced?  
To you especially  
  
I took it on my own  
To come an talk to you  
Because you were alone  
I hope I didn't intrude  
Observing you had shown  
That you were so lonely and blue  
  
Nothing beats a failure like a try  
There's a great reward  
Someone will surely hail you  
  
If you try  
But you must try hard  
And if I hadn't tried  
I wonder where I'd be  
If I upon relied  
On fate you meeting me  
But because I tried  
Together we'll always be  
  
Nothing beats a failure like a try  
There's a great reward  
Someone will surely hail you  
  
Oh darling  
Together we'll always be

In the wee hours of the morning  
After all have gone to bed  
Yes, I go all to myself  
Think of things that you have said  
Yeah, but I fall asleep, do you wonder  
If there is anything for me ahead  
  
I fell in love with you, baby  
Before I even held your hand  
And you were still in your teens  
Too young to understand  
But when you looked at me and smiled, darling  
That's when it all began  
  
You know I was just sitting here thinking  
About the things we used to do  
Ah, but you now belong to someone else  
And I'm still in love with you  
You know I wonder, I wonder  
Will I ever be back with you

In the wee, wee hours  
That's when I think of you  
In the wee, wee hours  
That's when I think of you  
You say, but yet I wonder  
If your love was ever true  
In a wee little room  
I sit alone and think of you  
In a wee little room  
I sit alone and think of you  
I wonder if you still remember  
All the things we used to do  
One little song  
For a fading memory  
One little song  
For a fading memory  
Of the one I really love  
The only one for me  
  

I bought a brand-new air-mobile  
It custom-made, 'twas a Flight De Ville  
With a pow'ful motor and some hideaway wings  
Push in on the button and you can hear her sing  
CHORUS:  
Now you can't catch me, baby you can't catch me  
'Cause if you get too close, you know I'm gone like a cool breeze  
New Jersey Turnpike in the wee wee hours  
I was rollin' slowly 'cause of drizzlin' showers  
Here come a flat-top, he was movin' up with me  
Then come wavin' by me in a little' old souped-up jitney  
I put my foot on my tank and I began to roll  
Moanin' siren, 'twas the state patrol  
So I let out my wings and then I blew my horn  
Bye bye New Jersey, I've become airborne  
(chorus)  
Flyin' with my baby last Saturday night  
Not a gray cloud floatin' in sight  
Big full moon shinin' up above  
Cuddle up honey, be my love  
Sweetest little thing I've ever seen  
I'm gonna name you Maybellene  
Flyin' on the beam, set on flight control  
Radio tuned to rock 'n' roll  
Two, three hours passed us by  
Five to two dropped to 5:05  
Fuel consumption way too fast  
Let's get on home before we run out of gas  
(chorus)  

Let's throw a twilight cookout  
We two, you two, no more  
Way out somewhere in the country  
Where we've never been before  
  
Let's throw it on a weekend  
We two, you two, no more  
And lounge away a holiday  
Like we've never done before  
  
We'll bring the rounds and some jazzy sound  
To play by a cozy fire  
You two roast wieners and we'll toast the buns  
And we'll chow till the night grows nighter  
  
We'll call for you on the weekend  
We two, you two, no more  
And ride out somewhere in the country air  
Just a cozy clan of four
