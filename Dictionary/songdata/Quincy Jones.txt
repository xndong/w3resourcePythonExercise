Everything must change  
Nothing stays the same  
Everyone must change  
No one stays the same  
  
The young become the old  
And mysteries do unfold  
Cause that's the way of time  
Nothing and no one goes unchanged  
  
There are not many things in life  
You can be sure of  
Except rain comes from the clouds  
Sun lights up the sky  
And hummingbirds do fly  
  
Winter turns to spring  
A wounded heart will heal  
But never much too soon  
Yes everything must change  
  
The young become the old  
And mysteries do unfold  
Cause that's the way of time  
Nothing and no one goes unchanged  
  
There are not many things in life  
You can be sure of  
Except rain comes from the clouds  
Sun lights up the sky  
And butterflies do fly  
  
Rain comes from the clouds  
Sun lights up the sky  
And music  
And music  
Makes me cry

Nobody knows where my johnny has gone  
But Judy left the same time  
Why was he holding her hand  
When he's supposed to be mine  
  
Play all my records keep dancing all night  
But leave me alone for a while  
'Till johnny's dancing with me  
I've got no reason to smile  
  
Judy and johnny just walked through that door  
Like a queen with her king  
Oh what a birthday surprise  
Judy's wearing his ring

I did my best  
But I guess my best wasn't good enough  
'Cause here we are back where we were before  
Seems nothing ever changes  
  
We're back to being strangers  
Wondering if we oughta stay  
Or head on out the door  
  
Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong  
Why we never last for very long  
What are we doing wrong  
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right  
  
Make the magic last for more than just one night  
If we could just get to it  
I know we could break through it  
  
I gave my all  
But I think my all may have been too much  
'Cause Lord knows we're not getting anywhere  
Seems we're always blowing whatever we got going  
  
And seems at times with all we've got  
We haven't got a prayer  
Just once can't we figure out what we keep doing wrong  
Why the good times never last for very long  
  
Seems we're always blowing  
Whatever we got going  
  
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right  
Make the magic last for more than just one night  
If we could just get to it  
I know we could break through it  
  
Just once I want to understand  
Why it always come back to good-bye  
Why can't we get ourselves in hand  
And admit to one another  
  
That we're no good with out the other  
Take the best and make it better  
Find a way to stay together  
  
Just once can't we find a way to finally make it right  
Make the magic last for more than just one night  
I know we can break through it  
If we could just get to it  
  
Just once  
If we could get to it  
  
Just Once...

Compliment what she does  
Send her roses just because  
If it's violins she loves let them play  
Dedicate her fav'right song and hold  
Her closer all night long  
Love her today  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Don't forget there could be  
An old lover in her memory  
If you need her so much more  
Why don't you say  
Maybe she has it in her mind  
That she's just wasting her time  
Ask her to stay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
Bein' cool won't help you keep a love warm

Take the time to open up your heart

Sacrifice if you care  
Buy her some moonlight to wear  
If there's one more star she wants  
Go all the way  
  
In your arms tonight  
She'll reflect that she owes you  
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay  
Find one hundred ways  
  
In your arms tonight  
She'll reflect that she owes you  
The sweetest of debts if she wants to pay
