Hear footsteps creak the floor  
The shadows give away  
Someone outside the door  
Won't let 'em in  
  
Life damaged kids to crime  
Rundown broke machine  
That steals your peace of mind  
Before you know it's gone  
  
Lay  
Down  
Lay  
  
Silence burning  
Hold your tongue  
Keep a separate  
So they'll know  
  
Hiding in the darkness under  
Boiling to the surface  
Don't go far  
  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
  
These things I hate in you  
Also reflect it seems  
Distortion laced with spikes  
Digs you out of me  
  
Lay  
Down  
Lay  
  
Hiding in the darkness under  
Boiling to the surface  
Crawling on your skin discomfort  
Makes you brake and run, stumble, fall  
  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
  
It's why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
It's why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
It's why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
It's why you never tell me whatevers on your mind  
  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
A looking in view too long on the outside  
Desperate plans make sense in a low life  
  
It's why you never tell me whatevers on your mind

You tried to kill me off  
Surprised I remain  
A scale tips impossible  
Afraid of my own name  
  
And I always paid attention to all the lines you crossed  
Forgive this imperfection it shows and know  
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner  
Dies in a corner  
  
Alone inside your mind  
  
Intend obsolescence  
Built into the system  
  
I tried to shake it off  
You can't remove this stain  
A scale breaks impossible  
Afraid we are the same  
  
And you never paid attention to all the lines I crossed  
Forgive this imperfection it shows and know  
I am the child that lives and cries in a corner  
Dies in a corner  
  
Alone inside your mind  
  
Hides in a corner  
Dies in a corner  
Alone inside your mind  
  
Intend obsolescence  
Built into the system

Hey, let them do it again, yeah  
Hey, you said you were my friend  
Hey, turn me upside down, Oh  
Hey, feelin' so down  
Hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
You made a fool of me again  
Again, again, again, again  
Again, again, again, again  
  
Hey, I know I made the same mistake, yeah  
I, I won't do it again, no  
Why, Why you slap me in the face, ow  
I, I didn't say it was OK, no  
No, no  
  
You violate a part of me again  
Again, again, again, again  
Again, again, again, again  
  
Ah, ooh  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
  
Hey, you had time to think it out, yeah  
Hey, Your weak will won't help her heal her heart  
Hey, I'll bet it really eats you up  
  
Extending part of me again  
Again, again, again, again  
Again, again, again, again  
  
Ooh  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah  
Doot doot, yeah, doot doot, yeah

Hope, a new beginning  
Time, time to start living  
Just like just before we died  
  
There's no going back to the dreams we started from  
  
Hurt, falling through fingers  
Trust, trust in the feeling  
There's something left inside  
  
There's no going back to the dreams we started from  
All secrets known  
  
Calm, old wounds are healing  
Strong, truth is worth saving  
I want to feel alive  
  
There's no going back to the dreams we started from  
All secrets known

It's been a long day at the bottom of the hill,  
She died of a broken heart.  
She told me I was living in the past,  
Drinking from a broken glass.  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to face the cold.  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to travel home.  
  
I walked down to the other end of the day,  
Just to catch those last few waves.  
I held out my hand and slowly waved goodbye,  
I turned now my eyes up to the sky.  
  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to face the cold.  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to travel home.  
  
She'll come back to me (She'll come back to me).  
She'll come back to me (She'll come back to me).  
All alone in this misery.  
She'll come back to me.  
  
I held out my hands into the light and I watched it die,  
I know that I was part to play.  
My god, my time to die.  
Never want to spend my life alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to face the cold.  
I'm alone (I never wanna be alone),  
Now I (now I) turn to travel home.

Loneliness it shadows me, quicker than darkness  
Crawls to the surface of my skin, visibly surrounded by it  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
Surrounded by empty souls, artificial courage used  
And because so, once was mine  
I walk this maze alone  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
The man's beside himself, man's below himself  
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself  
Chaos and hate shadow me, pain it fills me up  
  
Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
The man's beside himself, man's below himself  
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself  
Chaos and hate shadow me, hate it fills me up  
Only one thing makes me feel, missing better half of me  
Black is all I feel, so this is how it feels to be free  
The man's beside himself, man's below himself  
Man's behind himself, Am I inside myself

I don't want to feel no more  
It's easier to keep falling  
Imitations are pale  
Emptiness all tomorrows  
  
Haunted by your ghost  
  
Lay down, black gives way to blue  
Lay down, I'll remember you  
  
Fading out by design  
Consciously avoiding changes  
Curtain's drawn, now it's done  
Silencing all tomorrows  
  
Forcing a goodbye  
  
Lay down, black gives way to blue  
Lay down, I'll remember you

My cup runneth over  
Like blood from a stone  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
  
When the pig runs slower  
Let the arrow fly  
When the sin lies bolder  
I'll pluck out thine eye  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
  
If you scorn my lover  
Satan got your thigh  
If you steal in hunger  
I will kick you when you try  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
"all these things that you've done for me,  
Have left me so  
Fucking tired  
  
I'm not saying that you haven't done a lot of good,  
But if there's one thing you can do,  
You can bleed for me, bleed for me"  
  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me  
These stand for me  
Name your god and bleed the freak  
I like to see  
How you all would bleed for me

  
Wasting doubt dwelled in me  
Life slipped by wasted teens  
Feeling small as I look around  
Why can't I cleanse myself?  
  
Fall in, face it, feel it, pray  
Weighted what you wanted me to be  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain  
  
Twirling leech, spinning down below  
Wishing for the song to write  
Leer at me, I can't see  
Am I wrong to be?  
  
(Go)  
Fall in, face it, feel it, pray  
Weighted what you wanted me to be  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain  
  
Every god lives in me  
One who wallows in vain  
Are you real?  
Do you feel?  
Pain

I mending fence along the road  
Barely holding together  
Mapless zone the road signs holes  
Keep ahead of the weather  
Long past time to close dead eyes  
Find a break in the highway  
Out here I'm invisible  
Very few going my way  
  
Breath on a window, showing tic tac toe  
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home  
  
Ghost town strip of misery  
I ain't feeling no better  
Road kill heart inside of me  
Follow it to the letter  
Sundown brings a welcome change  
Everything that's hiding  
More at home in landscapes strange  
Are you selling I'm buying  
  
Breath on a window showing tic tac toe  
Rear view reflecting there ain't nobody home  
Cigarette burn holes outline an old soul  
Connect the dot scribbling  
And you would never know  
  
Failed to heed the signal  
Thought you got through just in time  
Crashing hard upon your ego  
Penetrated from the side  
  
I'd let you go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday  
  
I'd love to go, but you're always in the way  
I'm the damage done, your scar of yesterday

  
  
  
Frozen in the place I hide  
Not afraid to paint my sky with  
Some who say I've lost my mind  
Brother try and hope to find  
You were always so far away  
I know that pain so don't you run away  
Like you used to do  
Roses in a vase of white  
Bloodied by the thorns beside the leaves  
That fall because my hand is pulling them hard as I can  
You were always so far away  
I know that pain and I won't run away  
Like I used to do  
Pictures in a box at home  
Yellowing and green with mold  
So I can barely see your face  
Wonder how that color taste  
You were always so far away  
I know the way so don't you run away  
Like you used to do  
Like you used to do  
  

I could use some time to curl away  
My aggression is where you stake your claim  
Why I question this curve on which you grade  
My conception, a joke or latest craze?  
I try to get away, and yet I stick around  
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground  
  
My intention, may I arrive at eight?  
Lie and dream some, surprise you guys I'm late  
All right, correction, forgetting something, wait  
I try to get away, and yet I stick around (2x)  
So fall and crawl away, and brush away loose ground  
Brush away loose ground  
Brush away

So I found myself in the sun, oh yeah  
A hell of a place to end a run, oh yeah  
California, I'm fine  
Somebody check my brain  
California's all right  
Somebody check my brain  
Check my brain  
  
I walk these streets, I creep and I fall, oh yeah  
When she sang I answered the call, oh yeah  
California, I'm fine somebody check my brain  
California's all right somebody check my brain  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Guitar  
  
I hung my guns and put em away, oh yeah  
The trick of the trade, and by the way, oh yeah  
California, I'm fine somebody check my brain  
California's all right somebody check my brain  
  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Ah tears have filled my bones  
Ah years expended gone  
  
Check my brain, check my brain

I was only 15, standout on the Ave.  
You're chasing a bad dream, a luxury I never had  
Living my life in the box, or sleepin in the trash  
Taking girls for the things I need, like booze, drugs and ass  
Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone  
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright  
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black  
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh  
I don't care what you say, I  
Or what you do  
Chemical addiction is  
Getting rid of you  
So high, colors turn to sound  
Goodbye, let us in and we'll lay you in the ground  
Chosen on the floor, take another drag  
Bought a bunch of valiums from skinny broadway bag  
I don't know much about heroin but I, I wanna try  
Just about everything once before I die  
Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone  
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright  
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black  
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh  
I don't care what you say, I  
Or what you do  
Chemical addiction is  
Getting rid of you  
So high, colors turn to sound  
Goodbye, let us in and we'll lay you in the ground  
Now Jerry do me like this...  
Get stoned, daily survival in the war zone  
Yeah our teens meant everything, alright  
Half rack, smoking out till it's all black  
Death trap, watch me going blind, oh

Before you ask for something better  
You should know I'm practiced at goodbyes  
Are you so deprived  
Think you're doing me a favor  
I don't need no lesser savior  
I'm doing fine  
  
Fragile things so close together  
Taped up broken from before  
Part of something or all of nothing  
A very long hard way to fall  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pride alone  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride alone  
  
Needless tension, the walls around you  
Built before you came to tear them down  
It was you I found  
Take some time to think it over  
If it's so hard to walk this road we mind  
Then it's time to say goodbye  
  
Fragile things so close together  
Taped up broken from before  
Part of something or all of nothing  
A very long hard way to fall  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pridealone  
  
Go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride alone  
  
So go then, if you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Choking, eat your pride, eat your pride alone  
If you don't feel right  
Living in our home  
Eat your pride alone

There's no time to give at all  
I cause you grief and blow my hatred  
Further in your mind  
You reach, I run, you fall  
On skinned knees you crawl  
  
I want to set you free, recognize my disease  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering  
You're there crying, I feel not a thing  
Drilling my way deeper in your head  
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead  
  
So you sit and think of love  
I wait, hate all the more, I fall  
On skinned knees I crawl  
  
I want to set you free, recognize my disease  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering  
You're there crying, I feel not a thing  
Drilling my way deeper in your head  
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead  
  
Now there's time to give it all  
I put my fears behind again  
On skinned knees we'll crawl  
  
I want to set you free, recognize my disease  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering  
You're there crying, I feel not a thing  
Drilling my way deeper in your head  
Sinking, draining, drowning, bleeding, dead  
Love, sex, pain, confusion, suffering

I could climb until I reach where angels reside  
Ask around to find out where the junkies applied  
You just up and left me on this rock all alone  
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
  
I could drop until I touch the sinister side  
Visit all attractions flippin' back and aside  
Still you leave me rotting on this rock all alone  
It's my fault for knowing not what I should have known  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
  
Ohhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
  
I could climb until I reach where angels reside  
I could drop until I touch the sinister side  
  
Ohhhhhhhh  
My heart is dried up, beating slow  
Ohhhhh  
It's been deflating since you ... died  
Died  
Since you ... died  
You ... died  
Died  
You ... died  
Died  
You ... died

I have never felt such frustration  
Or lack of self control  
I want you to kill me  
And dig me under, I want to live no more  
  
[Chorus: ]  
One who doesn't care, is one who shouldn't be  
I've tried to hide myself from what is wrong for me  
For me  
  
I want to taste dirty, a stinging pistol  
In my mouth, on my tongue  
I want you to scrape me from the walls  
And go crazy like you've made me  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2x]  
  
You, you are so special  
You have the talent to make me feel like dirt  
And you, you use your talent to dig me under  
And cover me with dirt  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

Lost in your eyes, can't you find  
My intent to leave  
Taken to me, don't you see  
It's time for me to leave  
  
Distance aside, I realize  
How you make me feel  
Just call my name, we live the day  
To find somewhere to heal  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back, keeping us apart  
  
There's no one who knows me (There's no one who cares)  
There's no one  
I sit and stare (It follows me)  
Wasting all our fears  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back, keeping us apart  
  
(guitar solo)  
  
Looking to me will get you nowhere, fast  
I hope you see what you have done to me  
Your pain is near, you run again  
I try to save you all your style  
  
I can see far away  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away  
Looking back, keeping us  
  
I can see far away (I don't know who you are)  
Feeling me forever  
I can see far away (I don't know who you are, anymore)  
Looking back, keeping us apart  
  
Ahhhhhhhhhh.... (I don't know who you are)  
Ahhhhhhhhhh.... (I don't know who you are)

Hey, I ain't never coming  
Home  
Hey, I'll just wander my  
Own road  
Hey, I can't meet you here tomorrow  
Say goodbye don't follow  
Misery so hollow  
  
Hey you, you're livin'  
Life full throttle  
Hey you, pass me down that  
Bottle, yeah  
Hey you, you can't shake  
Me round now  
I get so lost and don't  
Know how  
And it hurts to care, so I won't now  
  
Forgot my woman, lost my  
Friends  
Things I'd done and where  
I've been  
Sleep in sweat the mirrors  
Cold  
See my face it's growin'  
Old  
Scared to death no reason  
Why  
Do whatever to get me by  
Think about the things I  
Said  
Read the page it's cold  
And dead  
  
Take me home  
Yeah, take me home  
Take me home  
Take me home, yeah  
Take me home  
  
Say goodbye, don't follow

Bury me softly in this womb  
I give this part of me for you  
Sand rains down and here I sit  
Holding rare flowers  
In a tomb, in bloom  
  
Down in a hole and I don't know if I can be saved  
See my heart I decorate it like a grave  
You don't understand who they  
Thought I was supposed to be  
Look at me now a man  
Who won't let himself be  
  
Down in a hole, feeling so small  
Down in a hole, losing my soul  
I'd like to fly,  
But my wings have been so denied  
  
Down in a hole and they've put all  
The stones in their place  
I've eaten the sun so my tongue  
Has been burned of the taste  
I have been guilty  
Of kicking myself in the teeth  
I will speak no more  
Of my feelings beneath  
  
Down in a hole, feelin' so small  
Down in a hole, losin' my soul  
I'd like to fly but my  
Wings have been so denied  
  
Bury me softly in this womb  
Oh I want to be inside of you  
I give this part of me for you  
Oh I want to be inside of you  
Sand rains down and here I sit  
Holding rare flowers  
(Oh I want to be inside of you)  
In a tomb, in bloom  
Oh I want to be inside  
  
Down in a hole, feelin' so small  
Down in a hole, losin' my soul  
Down in a hole, feelin' so small  
Down in a hole, outta control  
I'd like to fly but my  
Wings have been so denied

Jill, came tumbling down  
At the bottom of the hill  
Jack busted his crown  
Ah, my fairytale love story  
My fairy life  
My fairytale love story  
To get you off of my..  
I got to thinking  
Things aren't as good as they can be  
I got to drinking  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
Tommy Prince, kissed a few there on the lips  
She woke him with a cold sore, she ain't so pretty no more  
Ah, my fairytale love story  
My fairy life  
My fairytale love story  
To get you off of my..  
I got to thinking  
I'm not as sweet as them all  
I got to drinking again  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
My fairytale love story  
Ooo, My fairytale love story  
Yeah, you're my fairytale love story  
Ooo, my fairytale love story  
The bitch is over the brink  
The bitch is over the brink  
Rapunzel let down your hair, I'll cut it off

Aww put our heads together  
Because a signature could change our future  
Uh-huh  
For some wrote you a letter begging you to reconsider  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yea  
  
Put our heads together  
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhh  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices we'll blow you away  
  
So they put number on the television Mr. Gardner  
Oh yeah  
A messed up generation put the pressure on you  
You're a coward, uh-huh  
Yeah, yea-hey  
  
A messed up generation  
Ahhh, ahhh, ahhhh  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices we'll blow you away  
  
We can see right through you, we're awake  
Send your men and we are all awake  
Awake, awake, awake, awake  
Wake, awake, awake, awake  
  
Fear the voices you hear today  
If you still have choices we'll blow you away  
Fear the voices, fear the voices, fear the voices, fear the voices

I can't believe that once again  
I can't believe I under  
Stand  
I can't believe that once again  
I can't believe I almost  
Stand  
  
I felt the fool  
Shamed by the truth  
  
I see the ones I took alive  
I see the hate within my  
Life  
I breed the ones I knew I could  
I breed the ones who always  
Knew  
  
I felt the fool  
Shamed by the truth  
And I see (I see)  
Reasons for feeling your rules  
  
I felt the fool  
Shamed by the truth  
And I see (I see)  
Reasons for feeling your rules  
  
I can't believe it once again  
I can't belive I under  
Stand  
I can't believe it once again  
I can't believe I almost

What does friend mean to you?  
A word so wrongfully abused  
Are you like me, confused  
All included but you  
Alone  
The sounds of silence often soothe  
Shapes and colors shift with mood  
Pupils widen and change their hue  
Rapid brown avoid clear blue  
Why's it have to be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Flowers watched through wide brown eyes bloom  
A child sings an unclaimed tune  
Innocence spins cold cocoon  
Grow to see the pain too soon  
Why's it have to be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
Be this way  
"At seven am on a Tuesday, usual August  
Next week I'll be twenty eight  
I'm still young, it'll be me  
Off the wall I scrape you  
I can't wake, I gotta wake  
To cause this wake, I gotta wake no more  
It causes wake, to drown this hate  
To never really stay, never will  
You take your plate  
Put me through hell, live, live  
Direct your fate  
You say I can do it so well  
Your expiration date  
Your expiration date  
Fate, date, expiration date  
(this was the last time)  
Hate  
And don't fuck with me again  
My own clean slate  
Don't fuck with me again  
Makes your eyes dilate  
Makes you shake  
Irate"

Sat Sufferin  
I knew him when  
Fair weather friends of mine  
  
Try not to think  
I merely blink  
Hope to wish away the lies... Lies Can you protect me  
When I'm a wrecked  
I pretend you're still alive  
Yeeeaahh  
  
(2x... Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies...)  
  
I choose to day  
One deepen grave  
Thick fog that hide our smiles  
  
Clear all your sins  
Get born again  
Just repeat a couple lies  
Yeaheyeeeah  
  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies...)  
  
Can you protect me  
When I'm a wrecked  
I pretend your still alive  
  
I choose to day  
One deepen grave, thick fog that hide our smiles  
  
Sat Suffferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Get born again  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Sat Sufferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Get born again  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Sat Sufferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Get born again  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)  
Sat Sufferin  
(Oooo... Denied... All... And tied all the lies)

"Sure God's all powerful, but does he have lips? Whoa..."  
Dear God, how have you been then?  
I'm not fine, fuck pretending  
All of this death your sending  
  
Best throw some free heart mending  
Invite you in my heart, then  
When done, my sins forgiven?  
This God of mine relaxes  
  
World dies I still pay taxes  
Can I be as my God am  
Can you be as God am  
Can I be as my God am  
  
God of all my God am  
So Lord, I see you grinnin  
Must be grand always winning  
How proud are you being able  
  
To gather faith from fable  
Can I be as my God am  
Can you be as God am  
Can I be as my God am  
  
God of all my God am  
God am  
My God am  
God am  
  
God  
All the respect I'm giving  
Shared strength acquired by living  
All blooming life you're feeding  
  
Can't hide sick ones you're weeding  
Can I be as my God am  
Can you be as God am  
Can I be as my God am  
  
God of all my God am  
God am  
God am  
God am  
  
God am

Yeah, it goes away  
All of this and more of nothing in my life  
No color clay  
Individuality not safe  
As of now I bet you got me wrong  
So unsure you run from something strong  
I can't let go  
  
Threadbare tapestry unwinding slow  
Feel a tortured brain  
Show your belly like you want me to  
As of now I bet you got me wrong  
So unsure you run from something strong  
I haven't felt like this in so long  
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love  
  
That don't last forever  
Something's gotta turn out right  
You sugar taste  
Sweetness doesn't often touch my face  
Stay if you please  
You may not be here when I leave  
  
As of now I bet you got me wrong  
So unsure we reach for something strong  
I haven't felt like this in so long  
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love  
Strong, I haven't felt like this in so long  
Wrong, in a sense too far gone from love  
  
That don't last forever  
Something's gotta turn out right

  
  
  
No more time  
Just one more time  
So crazy, beat the strain  
Too lazy, shake the gray  
So, and she willed the rain  
So let me be defamed  
Your redundancy stains  
Tired of infantile claims  
Like puppets on a string  
Untangle you from me  
Time to call the doggies off  
Tired of the shadowin'  
Slide me to the side again  
Slapped in the face again  
No more time  
Just one more time  
Your redundancy stains  
Tired of infantile claims  
Like puppets on a string  
Untangle you from me  
So crazy, beat the strain  
Too lazy, shake the gray  
So, and she willed the rain  
So let me be defamed  
Time to call the doggies off  
Tired of the shadowin'  
Slide me to the side again  
Slapped in the face again  
One day my plane leaves  
Some way my head creeps  
Some day my head leads  
Some way my head creeps  
No more time  
Just one more time  
Empty room sets the scene  
Pick at me slow, pain fiend  
Suck me through barbed screen  
Anger becomes our queen  
Tongue whipping forked black  
How long until you crack  
Surprised and set back  
Lackeys' loose talk for fact  
Time to call the doggies off  
Tired of the shadowin'  
Slide me to the side again (2x)  
Slapped in the face again  
One day my plane leaves  
Some way my head creeps  
Some day my head leads  
Some way my head creeps  
Creeps  
No more time  
Just one more time  
So crazy feel the hate  
Yeah, I've got years to wait  
I know it's not too late  
Lending clean hands of fate  
Rise from the dirt I'm in  
Hide in another's skin  
Stick black dress doll with pin  
Your mouth takes on my grin  
So crazy (3x)  
  

Be what you want to be  
See what you came to see  
Been what you want to be  
I don't like what I see  
  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
  
Like the coldest winter will  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
And you think you have it still, heaven inside you  
So there's problems in your life  
  
That's fucked up, and I'm not blind  
I'm just see through faded, super jaded  
And out of my mind  
Do what you want to do  
  
Go out and seek your truth  
When I'm down and blue  
Rather be me than you  
Like the coldest winter chill  
  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
Like the coldest winter will  
  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
And you wish you had it still, heaven inside you  
So there's problems in your life  
That's fucked up, and I'm not blind  
  
I'm just see through faded, super jaded  
And out of my mind  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
  
Like the coldest winter chill  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
Like the coldest winter will  
Heaven beside you, hell within  
  
And you know you have it still, heaven inside you  
So there's problems in your life  
That's fucked up, but you're not blind  
You're just see through faded, overrated  
  
And out of your mind

Hung on a hook I'm a mirror  
Cracked down the center I split you  
Counting the clouds in a storm behind your eyes  
  
Show you the face of a man who  
Not that he wants but he has to  
Look at the thing he's become, what I see  
  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun  
  
Pieces of me on a tile floor  
Look up at you as you change more  
Floating in fear I appear a hundred times  
  
Hold a reflection inside me  
I cannot feel you are empty  
Throw me away  
I am broken not your time  
  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
I'm caught in a still life with no frame  
Sometimes people do, the world it don't change  
  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun  
Give up awaiting someday  
Future between a gun and your head  
  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia  
Not gonna save you  
Perform euthanasia

I can't have you blues  
I got the I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you...  
Nothings the same, need my fix of you  
A crack in the mirror, pictures split in two  
I can't believe you slipped away  
I been drinking too much cause I'm trying to forget your face  
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to  
I've been letting myself down to an early grave  
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to  
I've been letting myself down to an early grave  
Nothing stays the same, in this game  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you...  
Nothings the same, need my fix of you  
A crack in the mirror, pictures blank too  
I can't believe you slipped away  
I been drinking too much cause I'm trying to forget your face  
And if I always try to do, all the things you want me to  
I've been letting myself down to an early grave  
Nothing stays the same, in this game  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues  
I can't have you, I can't have you blues

Turn around you say  
'Scuse the 'tude but I haven't eaten today  
And my eyes are turning gray  
What's your name?  
I can't remember, I can't remember  
Bring me down you try  
Feel the pain and keep it all in till you die  
Without eyes you cannot cry  
Who's to blame?  
  
I can't remember,I can't  
Remember identity, the visions in my mind from  
Screamin' at me  
And mama, mama, ooh, my angry brains of infancy  
Knocked down but I have enough hate to breathe  
down your throat and steal your energy  
You took everything but my will to be  
Now the loss of your god won't make me bleed  
I am alive

Well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die  
Well, I don't wanna be a sailor mama, I don't wanna fly  
Well, I don't wanna be a failure mama, I don't wanna cry  
Well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no  
Well, I don't wanna be a rich man mama, I don't wanna cry  
Well, I don't wanna be a poor man mama, I don't wanna fly  
Well, I don't wanna be a lawyer mama, I don't wanna lie  
Well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, hey!  
Well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die  
Well, I don't wanna be a thief now mama, I don't wanna fly  
Well, I don't wanna be a churchman mama, I don't wanna cry  
Well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, hey!  
Oh well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die  
Well, I don't wanna be a sailor mama, I don't wanna fly  
Well, I don't wanna be a failure mama, I don't wanna cry  
Well, I don't wanna be a soldier mama, I don't wanna die  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no, oh no

Yeah, I want to travel south this year  
Aaah, Woah, Woah  
Won't prevent safe passage here  
  
Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
Yeah, hey yeah, tears that soak  
A callous heart  
  
Why you act frightened  
I am enlightened  
Your weakness builds me  
So someday you'll see  
  
I stay away  
  
Why you act crazy  
Not an act maybe  
So close a lady  
Shifty eyes shady  
  
I stay away [4x]

There I was, laid out on a table  
Screamin' sweat and bare feet to the floor  
In my life, I'd not soften  
Things that cut, and burn so often  
But I sit, think of somethin'  
Scared to face, the dyin' nothin'  
  
[Chorus: ]  
See the cycle I've waited for  
It ain't like that anymore  
  
Where I go, is when I feel I'm able  
How I fight, is why I'm feelin' sore  
In my mind, not forgotten  
Feel as though, a tooth were rotten  
Behind the smile, a tongue that's slippin'  
Buzzards cry, when flesh is rippin'  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
Here I sit writing on the paper  
Trying to think of words you can't ignore  
In my eyes, what I'm lacking  
Score at face, a ten for slacking  
Sign the deal, set in motion  
Smaller fish, so huge the ocean  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X

I close my eyes and watch the darkness  
Drawn to my world of make belive  
This world is filled with so much sorrow  
And I've seen all this world I care to see...  
  
I watch as castles fall around me  
Ungrumbled ruins of my home  
This world is filled with much unhappiness  
So many people so long  
  
Seeds that thrive in loveless gardens  
Fruits of such will bitter be  
Fields of hate and greed surround me  
And I've seen all this world I care to see...  
  
Care to see...  
Care to see...  
  
Seeds that thrive in loveless gardens  
Fruits of such will bitter be  
Fields of hate and greed surround me  
And I've seen all this world I care to see...

"Junk, fuck"  
A good night, the best in a long time  
A new friend turned me on to an old favorite  
Nothing better than a dealer who's high  
Be high, convince them to buy  
What's my drug of choice?  
Well, what have you got?  
I don't go broke  
And I do it a lot  
Seems so sick to the hypocrite norm  
Running their boring drills  
But we are an elite race of our own  
The stoners, junkies, and freaks  
Are you happy? I am, man.  
Content and fully aware  
Money, status, nothing to me  
'Cause your life is empty and bare  
What's my drug of choice?  
Well, what have you got?  
I don't go broke  
And I do it a lot  
I do it a lot, yeah  
You can't understand a user's mind  
But try, with your books and degrees  
If you let yourself go and opened your mind  
I'll bet you'd be doing like me  
And it ain't so bad  
What's my drug of choice?  
Well, what have you got?  
I don't go broke  
And I do it a lot  
Say, I do it a lot!  
I do it a lot!  
I do it a lot!  
Say, I do it a lot!

  
  
  
Don't need a gun  
Pointed at me  
Don't need to run  
Killer is me  
Killer is me  
So the sun  
Shines upon me  
Having fun  
Killer is me  
Insane the mind  
In the name of me  
Can't find the time  
To let things be  
Insane the mind  
In the name of me  
Can't find the time  
To let things be  
Let things be  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
And get over it  
So the sun  
Shines upon me  
Having fun  
Killer is me  
Killer is me  
Killer is me  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
Oh yeah  
Can I start over?  
And get over it  
Let things be  
Jerry: "Thank you!"  
"Thanks, that was really fun..."  
Layne: "I wish I could just hug you all! But I'm not gonna..."  
  

Move up from the table  
Stick her arm let her go  
Dropped dime on me last time  
By morning his blood turned bold  
Runnin from the law since Monday  
'Cause Suzy went down on time  
Got enough to last till Sunday  
So I'm burning on down that line  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
K-K-K-Killing Yourself  
Move up from the table  
Fat man going down  
Some run from the big gun  
Some just run from the sound  
Runnin from the law since Monday  
'Cause Suzy went down on time  
Got enough to last till Sunday  
So I'm burning on down that line  
Suzy was a bad child  
Always on the wrong side  
Ah, she was no good  
She was bad, bad, bad with the bad cats  
Always punching the needle in her arm  
Ah, but when she's good, she's so damn good  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
Killing Yourself  
K-K-K-Killing Yourself  
You're just killing yourself

Hot leather and sex  
All the things that I dress in best  
Ain't no way you can beat  
The way I'm flyin fast on my feet  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And I'm ready to roll  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And baby that's a fact alright  
Quickest gun in the west  
There ain't no question that I'm the best  
Drinking till I die  
You're sick and skinny well so am I  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And I'm ready to roll  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And baby that's a fact alright  
(Look Out!)  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And I'm ready to roll  
I'm the king, I'm the king, I'm the king of the kats  
And baby that's a fact alright  
Ooh, that's alright

Anybody out there  
Anyone at all  
Can you finally hear this deep in  
Scratching through the wall  
Came far to find me  
Down the rabbit hole  
Watch me smiling back while chewing on my skull  
  
I know, won't forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
Is the monkey breathing  
Looking kinda sick  
Got a witty comment for me  
Have yourself a kick  
Does it make you feel good  
Are you full and strong  
Gonna end up in this cage and I hope your stay is long  
  
I know, won't forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before  
  
Had enough, I don't need you to stick my hide  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry  
Had enough, I don't need you to blind my eyes  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry  
  
I know, won't forget  
Limped away from the wreck  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before it dies  
  
We'll never know what this is  
'til we take a look inside  
I'm sure we'll find what came before  
  
Had enough, I don't need you to stick my hide  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry  
Had enough, I don't need you to blind my eyes  
Had enough, no more tears for me left to cry

So young, so braise and so unholy  
I come to you in painted skies  
You're broken, taint your ancient story  
The living challenge you their lies  
  
Trapped in the cold outside  
There ain't no shelter  
And they want to force my hand  
Until I take what I wanted  
And break all their lies  
And defeat the fucking liars  
Smash all the temples  
And crawl through the rubble  
And cry to the fallen  
  
I'm the last of my kind still standing  
I'm the last of my kind still standing on the wall  
  
Oh, from out upon the hillside  
I am but what they've thrown away  
I go to sleep behind the eight ball  
I live to fight for one more day  
  
I'm trapped in the cold outside  
There ain't no shelter  
And they want to force my hand  
Until I take what I wanted  
And break all their lies  
And defeat the fucking liars  
Smash all the temples  
And crawl through the rubble  
And cry to the fallen  
  
Take what I wanted  
And break all the lies  
And defeat the fucking liars  
Smash all the temples  
And crawl through the rubble  
And cry to the fallen  
  
I'm the last of my kind still standing  
I'm the last of my kind still standing on the wall  
  
I'm the last of my kind still standing  
I'm the last of my kind still standing on the wall  
  
The last of my kind still standing  
The last of my kind still standing

Blame me  
Save a prayer for those who haunt you  
There now  
I don't mind if you still love me  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
  
Shame me  
Hide your heart from those who hunt you  
Way down (down, down)  
Would you care if I still need her  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
  
Save me  
Taken far from those who flaunt you  
Calm down  
Drag your heart and you behind her  
  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Don't come overhear what I say  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone

Just another lesson learned  
Wear a scar, a bore repeating  
Take a simple fateful turn  
Opened up to stop the bleeding  
  
Feeling you never could  
Been the disconnected frying  
Hit the vein and struck a nerve  
Seeing through a self that's blinding  
  
Nowhere to buy in  
Most of us hiding  
Others are shining  
  
You know when you find it  
In your darkest hour, you strike gold  
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all  
Just another lesson learned  
  
Just another brick you toss  
Stone the number one deceiver  
Multiply the added cost  
Easy to become a believer  
  
Feeling like you never could  
Been the disconnected frying  
Hit the vein and struck a nerve  
Seeing through a self that's blinding  
  
Nowhere to buy in  
Most of us hiding  
Others are shining  
  
You know when you find it  
In your darkest hour, you strike gold  
A thought clicks, not the be-all end-all  
  
Just another lesson learned

Alright  
You look at me, the world in your eyes  
You say like my style  
Oh yeah  
You keep hopin' till I make my move  
You resist and give me that smile  
Oh yeah  
I just want a little kiss  
But you keep on playin' those nasty little tricks  
I'm longing of a - (... Just another kiss)  
I want a lip lock rock  
Lip lock rock  
Lip lock rock  
Lip lock rock  
Whoa  
You make a man so frustrated  
You got my head buried in a hole  
Oh no  
Just tease me 'till I'm crazy  
I'm runnin' out of control  
I just want a little kiss  
But you keep on playin' those nasty little tricks  
I'm not gonna bite, I - (... Just want a little kiss)  
I want a lip lock rock  
Lip lock rock  
Lip lock rock  
Lip lock rock  
Whoa  
Lip lock  
Lip lock

I tried to love you I thought I could  
I tried to own you I thought I would  
I want to peel the skin from your face  
Before the real you lays to waste  
You told me I'm the only one  
  
Sweet little angel you should have run  
Lying, crying, dying to leave  
Innocence creates my hell  
  
Cheating myself still you know more  
It would be so easy with a whore  
Try to understand me little girl  
My twisted passion to be your world  
  
Lost inside my sick head  
I live for you but I'm not alive  
Take my hand before I kill  
I still love you, but, I still burn  
  
Yeah, love, hate, love  
Yeah, love, hate, love  
Yeah, love, hate, love  
Oh, Love, hate, love  
Yeah, Love, hate, love

Old mister fun is back  
Wonder where he's been hiding at  
Hanging round the edge  
Walls unfortified, inside  
  
No different, patchwork hack  
Toil away on an unlaid track  
Falls closing in, got nowhere to hide  
This time  
  
Finding ceilings low  
I'm too big or this room's too small  
Why's my ceiling another's floor  
  
Past twisted, expected wrap  
Attention span increasingly short  
Hard to breathe, this altitude will get you high  
I've tried  
  
Finding ceilings low  
I'm too big or this room's too small  
Why's my ceiling another's floor  
  
And nobody can tell you  
It's a moment in time  
That defines and deforms you  
  
Finding ceilings low  
I'm too big or this room's too small  
Why's my ceiling another's floor  
  
And nobody can tell you  
It's your moment in time  
  
Write me over, false reporter  
Can't you let me shine  
Write me over, false reporter  
Can't you let me shine  
  
And nobody can tell you  
It's a moment in time  
That defines and deforms you

There's no reason  
To deny  
It's the season  
Of the lie  
  
Having someone  
Grin at you  
Look at little fingers  
Pointing truth  
  
Man it's a weight on my mind  
And that's fine  
But now we wade past the point of decline  
There's no time  
  
I'm a believer  
In the new  
Past receiver  
All come true  
  
Look to the east  
Filled with hate  
Neutral flashers  
While we wait  
  
Man it's a weight on my mind  
And that's fine  
But now we wade past the point of decline  
There's no time  
  
I'm an old lover  
You're so sane  
Who's the answer  
Of what I mean  
  
In this ocean  
I fell into  
Break me out of  
The shell I grew  
  
Man it's a weight on my mind  
And that's fine  
But now we wade past the point of decline  
There's no time  
  
There's no time  
(There's no time)  
There's no time  
(There's no time)  
No time  
(There's no time)  
No time  
(There's no time)

I'm the man in the box  
Buried in my shit  
Won't you come and save me  
Save me  
  
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?  
Jesus Christ, deny your maker  
He who tries, will be wasted  
Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut  
  
I'm the dog who gets beat  
Shove my nose in shit  
Won't you come and save me  
Save me  
  
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?  
Jesus Christ, deny your maker  
He who tries, will be wasted  
Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut  
  
Feed my eyes, can you sew them shut?  
Jesus Christ, deny your maker  
He who tries, will be wasted  
Feed my eyes now you've sewn them shut

The first time I met you  
I thought that my life was complete  
But then I realized in the end  
You were nothin but a cheat  
  
Bridge:  
You took my heart  
And broke it  
I took it back  
And sewed it...  
  
Chorus:  
Cause I am, more than you are  
You showed me life  
And I shoved it back in ur fucking face  
I hate the way that you live ur life  
But oh well, I'm not apart of it, anymore  
  
Maybe, if you wouldn't have done this  
We'd still be complete  
But who cares, I do  
Cause I am better off now  
  
Bridge:  
  
Chorus:  
  
(Guitar Solo)  
  
The first time I met you  
I thought that my life was complete  
But who cares, I do  
Cause I am better off now  
  
Bridge:  
  
Chorus: 2x  
... Cause I'm not apart...  
I'm not apart...  
I'm, not, apart, of it, anymore...

  
  
  
Began this take at 7:38  
Head hit the board, enough that it aches  
Wonder should I be working so late  
Began this take at 7:38  
Head hit the board, enough that it aches  
Wonder should I be working so late  
Wonder should I be working so late  
Began this take at 7:38  
Head hit the board, enough that it aches  
Wonder should I be working so late  
Wonder should I be working so late  
Well the nothin song sticks to your mouth  
Like peanut butter on the brain (2x)  
Nothin ever stays the same  
Nothin, yeah nothin, nothin, nothin  
Went outside to give all a break  
Wearing cowhide, steak on a skate  
Back inside, Sam throw away your cake  
Went outside to give all a break  
Went outside to give all a break  
Wearing cowhide, steak on a skate  
Back inside, Sam throw away your cake  
Back inside, Sam throw away your cake  
Well the nothin song sticks to your mouth  
Like peanut butter on the brain (2x)  
Nothin ever stays the same  
Nothin, yeah nothin, nothin, nothin  
Gotta finish so I can awake  
Feed the cat as she spreads all the waste  
Snap her neck or trade in for new make  
Gotta finish so I can awake  
Feed the cat as she spreads all the waste  
Snap her neck or trade in for new make  
Snap her neck or trade in for new make  
Well the nothin song sticks to your mouth  
Like peanut butter on the brain (2x)  
Nothin ever stays the same  
Well the nothin song sticks to your mouth  
Nothin (5x)  
  

Yeah, it's over now  
But I can breathe somehow  
When it's all worn out  
I'd rather go without  
  
You know its been on my mind  
Could you stand right there  
Look me straight in the eye and say  
That it's over now  
  
We pay our debt sometime  
  
Well it's over now  
Yet I can see somehow  
When its all gone wrong  
It's hard to be so strong  
  
You know its been on my mind  
Could you stand right there  
Look me straight in the eye and say  
That it's over now  
  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime  
  
Guess it's over now  
I seem alive somehow  
When it's out of sight  
Just wait and do your time  
  
You know its been on my mind  
Could I stand right here  
Look myself in the eye and say  
That it's over now  
  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime  
We pay our debt sometime  
Yeah, we pay our debt sometime

No hope of rescue  
I'm trapped here alone  
If I don't dig my own way out, I'll die here  
  
Gave my loyalty too soon  
Now the forked-tongue piper's bill is due  
  
Weather is shifting  
So cold, going numb  
Through a pinhole of light, I see vultures circling  
  
Bottom feeders pick my skin  
Weathered brain a parasite within  
  
Ego pulverized  
No better medicine  
Angels have been advised  
Don't want no requiem  
  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Gonna wear you like a second skin  
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb  
  
Every new second  
Getting harder to breathe  
No matter which side I end up on, this ain't over  
  
My regrets are many, true  
Still so much worse lies ahead for you  
  
Ego pulverized  
No better medicine  
Angels have been advised  
Don't want no requiem  
  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
I'll just haunt you like a phantom limb  
Gonna wear you like a second skin  
I'll haunt you like a phantom limb

So you got the thing you wanted  
Don't let it go  
Though it hurts your hand to hold it  
Don't let it show  
  
I'm pretty done  
Once a favored son  
I'm pretty done  
Slap me 'round for fun  
  
Finding no pleasant changes  
In old enemies  
Not a lead a bit part playing  
In my story  
  
I'm pretty done  
Once a favored son  
I'm pretty done  
Slap me 'round for fun  
  
I don't care to further amuse you  
Never had you how, could I lose you?  
Paid in full, I owe no one at all  
  
I'm supposed to smile and ignore it  
Better than some  
High roads are to fall from  
Already hung  
  
I'm pretty done  
Once a favored son  
I'm pretty done  
Slap me 'round for fun  
  
Pushing towards hopeless mission  
Curiosity, omission  
History colored since the fall  
  
I'm pretty done  
I'm pretty done  
I'm pretty done  
I'm pretty done

Is she ready to know my frustration?  
What she slippin' inside, slow castration  
I'm a riddle so strong, you can't break me  
Did she come here to try, try to take me  
Did she call my name?  
I think it's gonna rain  
When I die  
Was it something I said, held against me?  
Ain't no life on the run, slowly climbing  
Caught in ice so she stares, stares at nothing  
I can help her but won't, now she hates me  
She won't let me hide  
She don't want me to cry  
Will she keep on the ground, trying to ground me  
Slowly forgive my lie, lying to save me  
Could she love me again, or will she hate me  
Prob'ly not, I know why, can't explain me  
Did she call my name?  
I think it's gonna rain  
When I die

Inside always trying to get back inside  
But it's so hard to penetrate pig-thick skin  
I'm 'bout as low as I can get  
I'd leave but I can't forget  
Still I wonder why it ain't right, mmm it ain't right, oooh  
Ain't right, mmm it ain't right, yeah  
'Bout as low as she can get  
She'll leave me but she won't forget  
And she wonders why she ain't right, she ain't right  
  
Ain't right, she ain't right  
Now we're as low as we can get  
Can't leave and can't forget  
We ain't right, we ain't right  
Not right, we ain't right  
Well it's hard to believe that somebody tricked you  
when you can see you were only high  
It's all up to you so you gamble  
flat on your face and into the fire

Ring them bells, ye heathen  
From the city that dreams,  
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries  
Cross the valleys and streams,  
For they're deep and they're wide  
And the world's on it's side  
And time is running backwards  
And so is the bride.  
  
Ring them bells, ring them bells!  
Ring them bells, ring them bells!  
  
Ring them bells St. Peter  
Where the four winds blow,  
You gotta ring them bells with an iron hand  
So the people will know  
That the rush hour is now  
On the wheel and the plow  
And the sun is going down  
Upon the sacred cow.  
  
Ring them bells, ring them bells!  
Ring them bells, ring them bells!  
  
Ring them bells Sweet Martha,  
For the poor man's son,  
You gotta ring them bells so the world will know  
That God is one.  
For the shepherd is asleep  
Where the willows weep  
And the mountains are filled  
With little lost sheep.  
  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf,  
Ring them bells for all of us who are left,  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who will judge the many when the game is through.  
Ring them bells, for the time that flies,  
For the child that cries  
When innocence dies.  
  
Ring them bells St. Catherine  
From the top of the room,  
Now ring them bells from the fortress  
For the lilies in bloom.  
For the lines, they are all long  
And the fighting is strong  
And they're breaking down the distance  
Between right and wrong.  
  
Ring them bells, ring them bells!  
Ring them bells, ring them bells!

Road narrows, pouring down  
I'm breaking without a sound  
Bits and pieces of trying  
Get what you pay for, nothing  
  
Frozen dreaming of yesterday  
Potent, creeping I'm far away  
From my hometown I lit out  
To save my skin and shed some doubt  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
  
Hard as truth is, been my friend  
Don't need to be invited in  
I'll go round 'til bested  
Pick up myself and try again  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
  
All comes in time  
Don't fight it, don't mind it  
Whatever may come  
  
All comes in time  
Don't fight it, don't mind it  
Whatever may come  
  
I know how false the floor  
How high the sky  
Been down that road before  
  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself  
It's a lie, you hide in someone else  
Like a shining scalpel, cut yourself

Mind, of destructive taste  
I choose... to stroll amongst the waste  
It was your heart  
Lost in the dark  
  
Call off the chase  
Walls of thought, strong and high  
As my castle crumbles with time...  
I think of you  
Oh, yes I do  
Such a crime  
  
[Chorus]  
You opened fire... and your mark was true  
You opened fire... aim my smiling skull at you  
You opened fire...  
  
I live tomorrow, you'll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow  
Lines cut across my face  
Why you laugh at my disgrace  
  
I'll never know  
How far to go  
To reach that place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I live tomorrow, you'll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x 4]  
I live tomorrow, you'll not follow  
As you wallow in a sea of sorrow

You insult me in my home, you're forgiven this time  
Things go well, your eyes dilate, you shake, and I'm high?  
Look in my eyes deep and watch the clouds change with time  
Twenty hours won't print my picture milk carton size  
Carton size, carton size  
Call me up congratulations ain't the real why  
There's no pressure besides brilliance let's say by day 9  
Endless corporate ignorance lets me control time  
By the way, by the way, by the way  
Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away  
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me  
Now the body of one soul I adore wants to die  
You have always told me you'd not live past 25  
I say stay long enough to repay all who cause strife  
Once again you see an in, discolored skin gives you away  
So afraid you kindly gurgle, out a date for me (2x)  
"I bear true and an existing witness  
To this barrel of monkeys.  
A self proclaimed immoral success,  
Perfected by each whereof  
Individually deadly and equally so  
And spread about the surrendered troops,  
For even thousands of miles will not  
Tear apart their communication, or the lack thereof.  
Vultures, liars, thieves, each proclaim their innocence  
In no suggestion or rhyme, your weapon is contained in  
The wrecking of the keeping the desired effect.  
The breaking of the spirit of what was once a whole being.  
Your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt, your weapon is guilt.  
Guilt."

"I'm serious, there's big money going on"  
"Big big money!"  
Why are here again?  
It's the same old sit down roll around chewed up pen  
  
Nothin' thrilling me too much, yeah  
Nothin' thrilling me too much, yeah  
Nothin' thrilling me too much, yeah  
Nothin' thrilling me  
  
Yeah, so close now  
Yeah, so close now  
Man I nearly snapped my twig  
Then again I nearly snapped a few of you  
  
So I hear you think highly now  
So I hear you think highly now  
So I hear you think highly now  
So I hear you think  
Yeah, so close now  
Yeah, so close now  
  
Why?  
Why?  
Why?

You say you don't like the way we look  
Well fuck off  
I ain't some dying dog that you can kick  
So fuck off  
It's so easy to fall into that hole  
And you're the one who cast me in that role  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right  
You say you don't like the place I live  
Well get out  
There ain't no vacancy in my bed  
So get out  
It's so easy to fall into that hole  
And you're the one who cast me in that role  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right  
(1, 2, 3, Go...)  
You say you don't like the way we look  
Well fuck off  
I ain't some dying dog that you can kick  
So fuck off  
It's so easy to fall into that hole  
And you're the one who cast me in that role  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right  
If you loved me would you call me a social parasite  
And who's the one to tell me whether it's wrong or right

Hey man, oh leave me alone, you know

Here I am again  
I feel time is dragging on  
Aren't you getting tired of me?  
Whinging overdrawn  
  
[Chorus]  
Faceless, blind  
Want to take her out again  
She's not just mine  
Want to take her out again  
  
In a bodiless embrace  
Thriving, I have grown  
Fickle, changing, grip replaced  
Choking, take it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dedicated, true to form  
Still the only one  
Only guarantee  
Continue after I am done  
  
[Chorus]

Come to me, I'll fill the hole  
Why would I be lying  
End fan, all planned out  
  
Offering a wonderful  
Peace of mind worth buying  
Bow down last round up  
  
I am wise and you don't know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a 'maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus don't like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
No problem with faith just fear  
  
Promise those who've gone before  
Waitin' on you flyin'  
Leading, receiving us  
  
I'm as flawed as any man  
Look at me I'm smiling  
Drink me, eat me up  
  
I am wise and you don't know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a 'maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus don't like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
No problem with faith just fear  
  
I am wise and you don't know  
A cloud is my home  
Only some get in  
Got a 'maginary friend  
  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
Jesus don't like a queer  
The devil put dinosaurs here  
The problem with faith  
  
Fear  
  
Liar, liar, liar, liar, liar, liar

I believe them bones are me  
Some say we're born into the grave  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them bones  
  
Dust rise right on over my time  
Empty fossil of the new scene  
I feel so alone, gonna wind up a  
Big ole pile a them bones  
  
Toll due bad dream come true  
I lie dead gone under red sky  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them  
  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them  
I feel so alone, gonna end up a  
Big ole pile a them bones

Who am I, is this me?  
Am I one or thirteen?  
  
I've gone cold, hard to deal  
Used to stand where I kneel  
  
Everybody listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
  
I want more, than I need  
I don't know what is real  
  
Everybody listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
Anytime I listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
  
Whispering of names, faces  
Uniforms I've worn  
And all that is gone  
Always climbing  
To fall down again  
Holding onto everything  
It's not what it seems  
  
I've been told, dreaming's free  
Think I'll go back to sleep  
  
Everybody listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
Anytime I listen  
Voices in my head  
Everybody listen  
Does yours say what mine says?  
  
Calling out the names, faces  
Uniforms I've worn  
And all that is gone  
Always climbing  
To fall down again  
Holding onto everything  
It's not what it seems

Scary's on the wall  
Scary's on his way  
Watch where you spit  
I'd advise you wait until it's over  
Then you got hit  
And you shoulda known better  
And we die young  
Faster we run  
Down, down, down you're rollin'  
Watch the blood float in the muddy sewer  
Take another hit  
And bury your brother  
And we die young  
Faster we run  
Scary's on the wall  
Scary's on his way  
Another alley trip  
Bullet seek the place to bend you over  
Then you got hit  
And you shoulda known better  
Faster we run  
And we die young

The face before me flies  
Laughs at me inside  
Masks are made to hide the glow  
Shining eyes  
Distance 'tween us grows  
Feeding lies  
  
It's hard to start things over  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
Something I should say  
It takes you every day  
What you give is not alive  
Today  
Your soul served on a plate  
Throw it away  
  
It's hard to start things over  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
It's hard to start things over  
Oh yeah  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
It's hard to start things over  
Oh yeah  
You can feel the fire around us  
All the time  
Yeah  
  
All the time  
  
What the hell have I?  
Little pride

Run, run 'til you drop  
Hide, everyone knows  
We all trade in never-befores  
Selling out for the score  
  
Prey, squeal when you're caught  
Cry, it's not my fault  
Time to trade in never-befores  
Selling out for the score  
  
It seems you prophesized  
All of this would end  
Were you burned away  
When the sun rose again?  
  
Hate, long wearing thin  
Negative, all you've been  
Time to trade in never-befores  
Selling out for the score  
  
It seems you prophesized  
All of this would end  
Were you burned away  
When the sun rose again?

Time to change has come and gone  
Watched your fears become your god  
It's your decision  
It's your decision  
  
Overwhelmed, you chose to run  
Apathetic to the stunned  
It's your decision  
It's your decision  
  
You feed the fire that burned us all  
When you lied  
To feel the pain that spurs you on  
Black inside  
  
No-one plans to take the path that brings you nowhere  
Here you stand before us all and say it's over  
  
It's over  
  
It might seem an after thought  
Yes it hurts to know you're bought  
It's your decision  
It's your decision  
  
You feed the fire that burned us all  
When you lied  
To feel the pain that spurs you on  
Black inside  
  
It's your decision  
It's your decision  
  
No-one plans to take the path that brings you nowhere  
Here you stand before us all and say it's over  
  
It's over  
It's over
