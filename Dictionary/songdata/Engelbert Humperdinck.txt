A time for us, someday there'll be  
When chains are torn by courage born of a love that's free  
A time when dreams so long denied  
Can flourish  
As we unveil the love we now must hide  
  
A time for us, at last to see  
A life worthwhile for you and me  
  
And with our love through tears and thorns  
We will endure  
As we pass surely through every storm  
A time for us, someday there'll be  
A new world  
A world of shining hope for you and me  
  
And with our love through tears and thorns  
We will endure  
As we pass surely through every storm  
A time for us, someday there'll be  
A new world  
A world of shining hope for you and me  
A world of shining hope for you and me

I feel so bad, I got a worried mind  
I'm so lonesome all the time  
Since I left my baby behind on Blue Bayou  
Saving nickels, saving dimes  
  
Working till the sun don't shine  
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou  
I'm going back someday come what may to Blue Bayou  
Where you sleep all day and the catfish play on Blue Bayou  
  
All those fishing boats with their sails afloat if I could only see  
That familiar sunrise through sleepy eyes how happy I'd be  
Gonna see my baby again  
And to be with some of my friends  
  
Maybe I'd be happier then on Blue Bayou  
Saving nickels, saving dimes  
Working till the sun don't shine  
Looking forward to happier times on Blue Bayou  
  
I'm going back someday gonna stay on Blue Bayou  
Where the folks are fine, and the world is mine  
On Blue Bayou  
And that girl of mine by my side  
  
The silver moon and the evening tide  
Some sweet day gonna take away this hurting inside  
I'll never be blue my dreams come true on Blue Bayou

Blue eyes  
Baby's got blue eyes  
Like a deep blue sea  
On a blue blue day  
Blue eyes  
Baby's got blue eyes  
When the morning comes  
I'll be far away  
And I say  
  
Blue eyes  
Holding back the tears  
Holding back the pain  
Baby's got blue eyes  
And she's alone again  
  
Blue eyes  
Baby's got blue eyes  
Like a clear blue sky  
Watching over me  
Blue eyes  
I love blue eyes  
When I'm by her side  
Where I long to be  
I will see  
  
Blue eyes laughing in the sun  
Laughing in the rain  
Baby's got blue eyes  
And I am home, and I am home again

By the time I get to Phoenix she'll be rising,  
She'll find the note I left hanging on the door,  
She'll laugh we she reads the part that says I'm leaving,  
Cause I've left that girl so many times before.  
  
By the time I make Alberquerque she'll be working,  
She'll probably stop at lunch and give me a call,  
But she'll just hear the phone keep on ringing,  
Off the wall, that's all.  
  
By the time I make Oklahoma she'll be sleeping,  
She'll turn softly and call my name out low,  
She'll cry just to think I'd really leave her,  
Though time and time I've tried to tell her,  
  
She just didn't know, I would really go.

You're just too good to be true.  
Can't take my eyes off you.  
You'd be like Heaven to touch.  
I wanna hold you so much.  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive.  
You're just too good to be true.  
Can't take my eyes off you.  
  
Pardon the way that I stare.  
There's nothing else to compare.  
The sight of you leaves me weak.  
There are no words left to speak,  
But if you feel like I feel,  
Please let me know that it's real.  
You're just too good to be true.  
Can't take my eyes off you.  
  
I love you, baby,  
And if it's quite alright,  
I need you, baby,  
To warm a lonely night.  
I love you, baby.  
Trust in me when I say:  
Oh, pretty baby,  
Don't bring me down, I pray.  
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay  
And let me love you, baby.  
Let me love you.  
  
You're just too good to be true.  
Can't take my eyes off you.  
You'd be like Heaven to touch.  
I wanna hold you so much.  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive.  
You're just too good to be true.  
Can't take my eyes off you.  
  
I love you, baby,  
And if it's quite alright,  
I need you, baby,  
To warm a lonely night.  
I love you, baby.  
Trust in me when I say:  
Oh, pretty baby,  
Don't bring me down, I pray.  
Oh, pretty baby, now that I found you, stay

In a little cafe just the other side of the border  
She was just sitting there givin' me looks that made my mouth water  
So I started walking her way  
She belonged to that man, Jose  
And I knew, yes I knew I should leave  
When I heard her say, yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
You're my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
I'm all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
So we started to dance  
In my arms, she felt so inviting  
That I just couldn't resist  
Just one little kiss so exciting  
Then I heard the guitar player say  
"Vamoose, Jose's on his way"  
Then I knew, yes I knew I should run  
But then I heard her say, yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
You're my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
I'm all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
Then the music stopped  
When I looked the cafe was empty  
Then I heard Jose say  
"Man you know you're in trouble plenty"  
So I dropped my drink from my hand  
And through the window I ran  
And as I rode away  
I could hear her say to Joscute, yeah  
  
Come a little bit closer  
You're my kind of man  
So big and so strong  
Come a little bit closer  
I'm all alone  
And the night is so long  
  
La la-la-la la-la  
La la-la-la la-la  
Ho ho la-la  
La la la-la

Come over here, come over here  
Come over here, come over here  
Let me tell you, come over here  
That I love you, come over here  
And everything, come over here  
Is going just all right, come over here  
Come over here, come over here  
And be with me tonight, come over here  
And everything will be all right  
Come over here, come over here  
  
Yeah  
  
Come over here, come over here  
I want to let you know  
I want you so bad, come over here  
There must be a reason, come over here  
I've got a pride, come over here  
It was you, come over here  
Don't let it happen to me, come over here  
I need good, good loving, come over here  
Darling, darling, come over here  
  
You better stop it, come over here  
Dogging me around, come over here  
So come on over here, come over here  
Come on over here, come over here  
So you've got the power, come over here  
And you better think, come over here  
You better think, come over here  
I want you please, please, come over here  
Please, please, come over here  
Listen to me, come over here  
You're so hard I can't stand no more, come over here  
So please, please, come over here  
Please, please, come over here  
Tell me what I did wrong, come over here  
Walk right up to me baby, come over here  
Please, please, come over here  
Please, please, come over here  
Come over here, come over here, come over here  
I said please, please, come over here  
Tell me, come over here  
Try me, come over here  
Try me, come over here  
  
Try me, come over here  
And let me, come over here  
And everthing would be all right  
Come over here, come over here, come

This is our last dance together  
Some will never forget  
You gave me the love of a lifetime  
Not a moment with you I regret  
  
But I'm so afraid of tomorrow  
'Cause I got to face it alone  
I'm losing my reason for living  
I'll be just a man on my own  
  
Oh baby, I'm dancing with tears in my eyes  
I hear the music but after it died  
I know we'll never share it again  
This song we're singing will come to an end  
  
Oh darling, I wish we could dance forever  
And spend my life in your arms  
Deep down I knew we had no future  
What rainy day you would go  
  
I guess I just find you too late girl  
And you can't better hurting, I know  
Nothing and no one can change you  
Until yourself, you're true  
  
But God knows, I always remember  
The light in my life, that was you

Dommage, dommage  
Our love was once exciting  
Now it's just a game we play  
To bad but nothing last forever  
All at once we've lost our way  
  
Hello, goodbye,  
And suddenly it's over  
And there is nothing  
We can do  
Dommage, dommage  
Too bad we couldn't make  
  
Our dreams come true  
  
Hello, goodbye,  
And suddenly it's over  
And there is nothing,  
Nothing we can do  
  
Dommage, dommage  
Too bad we couldn't make  
Our dreams... Come... True

It's hard to be away from the one you love  
And the day seemed slowly drifting by  
But my darling  
I'd be home in your arms were I belong  
So I'm sending you this poem from my heart  
  
Dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
  
Although we are many, many miles apart  
You are always in my aching heart  
But my darling  
I'd be home in your arm were I belong  
So I'm sending you this poem from my heart  
  
Dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
  
Dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
So dream of me when you're lonely  
Dream of me when you're sad  
'Cause darling I want you only  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
You're the nicest, nicest love I've ever had  
So dream of me

I'll be loving you eternally (eternally)  
With a love that's true, eternally (eternally)  
From the start, within my heart  
It seems I've always known  
The sun would shine (shine)  
When you were mine (mine)  
And mine alone. (mine alone.)  
  
I'll be loving you eternally (eternally)  
There'll be no one new, my dear, for me (eternally)  
Though the sky should fall  
Remember I shall always be  
Forever true (true)  
And loving you (you)  
Eternally...

Wish they hadn't seen him walk away,  
And heard me beg him stay, please stay.  
Why, why did we choose this crowded place,  
They all know it, cause I show it in my face.  
Everybody knows you said goodbye,  
Everybody knows we're through.  
Now they all can see the tears I cry,  
Running down my face for you.  
They all said it's too good to be true,  
He'll make a fool of you, one day.  
I just laughed and said our love was strong,  
But you left me, and they all know I was wrong.  
Everybody knows you're tired of me,  
Everybody knows we're through.  
Though I'm on my own I can't be free,  
Baby, I just live for you.  
Everybody knows you said goodbye,  
Everybody knows we're through...

Everybody's talkin' at me  
Can't hear a word they're sayin'  
Only the echoes of my mind  
People stoppin', starin'  
I can't see their faces  
Only the shadows of their eyes  
Goin' where the sun keeps shinin'  
In the pouring rain  
Goin' where the weather suits my clothes  
Banking off a northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer's breeze  
Skipping over the ocean  
Like a stone  
  
Everybody's talkin' at me  
Can't hear a word they're sayin'

People stoppin', starin'  
I can't see their faces

Banking off a northeast wind  
Sailin' on a summer's breeze  
Skipping over the ocean  
Like a stone  
  
And you know I'll never leave my love behind

Don't look so sad, I know it's over  
But life goes on and this old world will keep on turning  
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together  
There's no need o watch the bridges that we're burning  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
  
For the Good times  
I'll get along, you'll find another  
  
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me  
Don't say a word about tomorrow or forever  
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops fallin' soft against the window  
And make believe you love me one more time  
  
For the good times  
For the good times

Last night, quietly, she walked through my mind  
As I lay searching for sleep.  
Her soft hand reached out, she whispered my name  
As she brushed a tear from my cheek.  
And then those funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Started walkin' all over my mind.  
It's sad, so sad to watch love go bad,  
But a true love would not have gone wrong.  
I'm just thankful for the good times we've had  
For without them I could not go on,  
With all these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Walkin' all over my mind.  
I must go on, be strong,  
Tho' a million teardrops may fall,  
Before these funny familiar forgotten feelings  
Stop walk' all over my mind.

I still keep her memory around me  
I still hear her voice in my head  
The boxes of books  
That she never took  
And pictures that hang by the bed  
  
With so many promises broken  
I'll place all my dreams on the shell  
And give it my best  
To put her to rest  
Though I can't believe it myself  
  
Goodbye Maria, I love you  
How long will you stay in my heart  
I'll try every day  
To get myself to say  
Goodbye Maria, goodbye  
  
I'll try to forget how she loved me  
And hope that her memory will end  
But one love around  
My world starts tumbling down  
And here comes that feeling again  
  
Goodbye Maria, I love you  
How long will you stay in my heart  
I'll try every day  
To get myself to say  
Goodbye Maria, goodbye  
  
I never know why  
You had to leave me here  
Without a rime of reason left to try  
  
Goodbye Maria, I love you  
How long will you stay in my heart  
I'll try every day  
To get myself to say  
Goodbye Maria, goodbye

I saw the harbor lights  
They only told me we were parting  
The same old harbor lights that once brought you to me  
I watched the harbor lights  
How could I help if tears were starting  
Goodbye to tender nights beside the silv'ry sea  
  
I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring  
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me  
  
I long to hold you near and kiss you just once more  
But you were on the ship and I was on the shore  
  
Now I know lonely nights  
For all the while my heart is whisp'ring  
Some other harbor lights will steal your love from me

Have I told you lately that I love you?  
Have I told you there's no one else above you?  
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness,  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do.  
  
For the morning sun in all it's glory,  
Meets the day with hope and comfort too,  
You fill my life with laughter, somehow you make it better,  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do.  
  
There's a love less defined,  
And its yours and its mine,  
Like the sun.  
And at the end of the day,  
We should give thanks and pray,  
To The One, to The One.

To really love a woman  
To understand her, you gotta know it deep inside  
Hear every thought, see every dream  
N' give her wings, when she wants to fly  
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms  
You know you really love a woman  
  
When you love a woman you tell her  
That she's really wanted  
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one  
She needs somebody to tell her  
That it's gonna last forever  
So tell me have you ever really  
Really really ever loved a woman?  
  
To really love a woman  
Let her hold you  
Til ya know how she needs to be touched  
You've gotta breathe her, really taste her  
Til you can feel her in your blood  
N' when you can see your unborn children in her eyes  
You know you really love a woman  
  
When you love a woman  
You tell her that she's really wanted  
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one  
She needs somebody to tell her  
That you'll always be together  
So tell me have you ever really  
Really really ever loved a woman?  
  
You got to give her some faith - hold her tight  
A little tenderness - gotta treat her right  
She will be there for you, takin' good care of you  
Ya really gotta love your woman  
  
Then when you find yourself lyin' helpless in her arms  
You know you really love a woman  
When you love a woman you tell her  
That she's really wanted  
When you love a woman you tell her that she's the one  
She needs somebody to tell her  
That it's gonna last forever  
So tell me have you ever really  
Really really ever loved a woman?  
  
Just tell me have you ever really,  
Really, really, ever loved a woman? You got to tell me  
Just tell me have you ever really,  
Really, really, ever loved a woman?

Wish she could see the part of me  
That hides behind the love that used to be  
It got lost somehow, heart don't fail me now  
  
Took so long for you to mend  
And now I am face to face with love again  
Need you to show me how, heart don't fail me now  
  
No one ever told me there'd be someone like her  
To make it all seem worth another try  
This time love found me too afraid to take a chance  
But too afraid to let it pass me by  
  
I can't forget the hurt before, I'd be a fool for coming back for more  
Except this time I feel so sure  
We'll make it work somehow, heart don't fail me now

Take the ribbon from your hair  
Shake it loose, let it fall  
Lay it soft against my skin  
Like the shadow on the wall  
  
Come and lay down by my side  
Till the early morning light  
All I'm taking is your time  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't care what's right or wrong  
I won't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
'Cause tonight I need a friend  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't care what's right or wrong  
I won't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
'Cause tonight I need a friend  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't want to be alone  
Help me make it through the night

Holly holy eyes  
Dream of only you  
Where I am, what I am  
What I believe in Holly holy  
Holly holy dream  
Wanting only you  
And she comes  
And I run just like the wind will  
Holly holy  
Sing a song  
Sing a song of songs  
Sing it out  
Sing it strong  
Call the sun in the dead of the night  
And the sun's gonna rise in the sky  
Touch a man who can't walk upright  
And that lame man, he's gonna fly  
And I fly  
And I fly  
Holly holy love  
Take the lonely child  
And the seed  
Let it be filled with tomorrow  
Holly holy  
Sing a song  
Sing a song of songs  
Sing it out  
Sing it strong  
Call the sun in the dead of the night  
And the sun's gonna rise in the sky  
Touch a man who can't walk upright  
And that lame man, he's gonna fly  
And I fly, yeah  
And I fly  
Holly holy dream  
Dream of only you  
Holly holy love  
Holly holy love

Sometimes at night I don't know why  
I get the feeling that I wanna say goodbye  
I can see me packin' up a bag and walkin' out the door  
I'm goin' back to live the life I used to live before  
  
Out on my own, all by myself  
Not takin' care of me or anybody else  
But how could I ever word it in the note I'd have write?  
Oh, I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
I lie in bed and I'm wide awake  
Next to the one whose heart I'd hate to have to break  
Then I look into her pretty eyes that don't deserve to cry  
And I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
Each time I hold her it's love all over  
And in my heart it's understood  
I'll never learn how to live without her  
And I'd be crazy if I could  
  
She's good to me and I believe  
She let me go with it meant happiness for me  
Maybe that's the reason why I find my tongue is tied  
And I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
Each time I hold her it's love all over  
And in my heart it's understood  
I'll never learn how to live without her  
And I'd be crazy if I could  
  
I love her so I wanna tell her now  
I think I'll wake her with a kiss and show her how  
And I know she'll whisper in my ear a million reasons why  
I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
And when she's layin' in my arms I cannot tell a lie  
I don't know how to say goodbye  
  
I don't know how to say goodbye  
I don't know how to say goodbye

All our friends keep knocking at the door  
They've asked me out a hundred times or more  
But all I say is, "Leave me in the gloom"  
And here I stay within my lonely room  
'Cause  
  
I don't want to walk without you, Baby  
Walk without my arm about you, Baby  
I thought the day you left me behind  
I'd take a stroll and get you right off my mind  
But now I find that  
I don't want to walk without the sunshine  
Why'd you have to turn off all that sunshine?  
Oh, Baby, please come back or you'll break my heart for me  
'Cause I don't want to walk without you  
No, sire

She cried and walked away just yesterday  
And like a fool, I let her go  
We had a silly fight the night before  
I never said "I love you so"  
I wept all day and then I got the call  
"Would you please come to see your wife"  
"Something has happened and it's very grave"  
"We cannot save the lady's life"  
  
No, I never said goodbye and I never really told her  
Just how much she meant to me  
No, I never said goodbye, now it's too late  
And she's just a memory  
How can I go on  
Now that girl is gone  
I will know, until I die  
I never said goodbye  
  
Her perfume lingers all around me now  
A pair of shoes lie on the floor  
The bed unmade, where just last night, she laid  
I cannot say I closed the door  
A shopping list of things she'll never buy  
An apron lyin' on the chair  
Is that her laugh I hear out in the hall  
I turn and call, but she's not there  
  
No, I never said goodbye  
And I never really told her just how much she meant to me  
No, I never said goodbye  
Now it's too late and she's just a memory  
How can I go on  
Now that girl is gone  
I will know, until I die  
I never said goodbye

wishing you were with me now  
Praying for the times we shared together  
Of which I thought they'd last forever  
To somehow re-appear  
wondering what it would be like  
If you would be there when morning's broken  
Too many things were left unspoken  
Oh why can't you be here  
Chorus.  
It I could only be with you  
There's still so many things for us to do  
The years have passed and tears still fill my eyes  
Every time I think about our love that never dies  
wishing you were with me now  
Wondering why the laughing and the crying  
The making fun, and never lying  
Just had to disappear  
thinking what it would be like  
To re-live the love and care you gave me  
To thank you for those limes you saved me  
Oh why can't you be here  
Chorus:  
If I could only be with you  
There's still so many things for us to do  
The years have passed and tears still fill my eyes  
Every time I think about our love that never dies  
all I have in life  
I would gladly give away  
If it meant for one day  
You'd be there  
Chorus.  
If I could only be with you  
There's still so many things for us to do  
The years have passed and tears still fill my eyes  
Every time I think of you, still hurts inside  
if you could only hear me now  
If I could get these words to you somehow  
For a moment I would make you realise  
I'm still so proud to share with you  
This love that never dies  
I want so much to let you know  
Our love will never die  
  
  

Stay beside me, stay beside me  
Say you'll never leave me  
How I love you, how I love you  
How I need you, please believe me  
In your arms, I've found my heaven  
And your lips have done their part  
  
Il mondo  
Your love is all I need in my world  
Let tender kisses plead in my world  
How could I ever live without you  
  
Il mondo  
My heart belongs to you, so take it  
And promise me you'll never break it  
Say you'll stay here in my arms  
  
Stay beside me, stay beside me  
Say you'll never leave me  
How I love you, how I love you  
How I need you, please believe me  
In your arms, I've found my heaven  
And your lips have done their part  
  
Il mondo  
Your love is all I need in my world  
Let tender kisses plead in my world  
How could I ever live without you  
Il mondo  
My heart belongs to you, so take it  
And promise me you'll never break it  
Say you'll stay here in my arms  
Here in my arms

I'll be seeing you in all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces all day through  
In that small cafe, the park across the way  
The children's carousel,  
The chestnut trees, the wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you in every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find you in the morning' sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you  
I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you

If I could catch a star before it touched the ground  
I'd place it in a box, tie ribbons all around  
And then I'd offer it to you  
A token of my love and deep devotion  
The world's a better place  
With you to turn to  
I'm a better man  
For having loved you  
  
And now, at last, I face the future unafraid  
With you here by my side, how fast the shadows fade  
And there is hope inside my heart  
Cause I have something wonderful to live for  
The world's a better place  
With you to turn to  
I'm a better man  
For having loved you  
  
And as I am today  
That's how 'll always stay  
A better man for having loved you  
A better man for having loved you  
  
The world's a better place  
With you to turn to  
I'm a better man  
For having loved you  
And as I am today  
That's how I'll always stay  
A better man for having loved you  
A better man for having loved you  
  
If I could catch a star before it touched the ground  
I'd place it in a box, tie ribbons all around  
And then I'd offer it to you

In the still of the night  
As I gaze from my window  
At the moon in its flight  
My thoughts all stray to you  
  
In the still of the night  
While the world is in slumber  
Oh, the times without number  
Darling, when I say to you  
  
Do you love me as I love you  
Or you might lie to be my dream come true  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill still of the night  
  
Do you love me as I love you  
Or you might lie to be my dream come true  
Or will this dream of mine fade out of sight  
Like the moon growing dim on the rim of the hill  
In the chill still of the night

I heard she sang a good song  
I heard she had a style  
And so I came to see her  
And listen for a while  
And there she was, this young girl  
A stranger to my eyes  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
  
I felt all flushed with fever  
Embarrassed by the crowd  
I felt she found my letters  
And read each one out loud  
I prayed that she would finish  
But she just kept right on  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Oh, singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
  
She sang as if she knew me  
In all the God despair  
And then she looked right through me  
As if I wasn't there  
And she just kept on singing  
Singing clear and strong  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
  
Strumming my pain with her fingers  
Singing my life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song  
Killing me softly with her song  
Telling my whole life with her words  
Killing me softly with her song

Over rocks and trees and sand  
Soaring over cliffs  
And gently floating down to land  
She proudly lifts her voice  
To sound her mating call  
And soon her mate responds by singing  
Caw Caw Caw  
Come with me  
Lesbian Seagull  
Settle down and rest with me  
Fly with me lesbian seagull  
To my little nest by the sea  
With me that's where you belong with me  
I know I can be strong when you're with me  
She skims the water  
At the new time to seek  
Her fish and she emerges  
With one squirming in her beak  
She plays among the waves  
And hides between the swells  
She walks the beach at twilight  
Searching for some shells  
Come with me  
Lesbian Seagull  
Settle down and rest with me  
Oh fly with me lesbian seagull  
To my little nest by the sea  
With me that's where you belong with me  
I know I can be strong when you're -- you're with me  
And in the evening  
As they watch the setting sun  
She loooks at her as if to say  
The day is done  
It's time to find their shelter  
Hidden in the dunes  
And fall asleep the  
Music of the moon  
You and me  
Lesbian seagull  
You just watch the world oh my  
Just you and me lesbian seagull  
Side by side with me 'till we die  
('Till we die)  
You and I  
We can make it if we try  
Our love will keep us flyin' high  
Until we die...  

Love is a many splendored thing  
It's the April rose that only grows in the early Spring  
Love is nature's way of giving a reason to be living  
The golden crown that makes a man a king  
Once on a high and windy hill, In the morning mist  
Two lovers kissed and the world stood still  
Then your fingers touched my silent heart and taught it how to sing  
Yes, true love's a many splendored thing

Each time I look at you is like the first time  
Each time you're near me the thrill is new  
And there is nothing that I wouldn't do for  
The rare delight of the sight of you for  
  
The more I see you, the more I want you  
Somehow this feeling just grows and grows  
With every sigh I become more mad about you  
More lost without you and so it goes  
  
Can you imagine how much I love you?  
The more I see you as years go by  
I know the only one for me can only be you  
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try  
  
I know the only one for me can only be you  
My arms won't free you, my heart won't try

MY MARIE  
WRITERS BARRY MASON, TONY MACAULAY  
Marie  
I can't bear to see the children without bread  
Oh Marie  
They deserve a decent roof above their heads  
Trust me now  
And when I leave for town, my darling, don't be sad  
Or ask me how  
But tomorrow, we're have all the things we never had  
But if I'm not back there with you  
By the time the sun goes down  
Take the train, change your name  
And get the children out of town  
Yes, if I'm not back there with you  
By the time the sun has gone  
Forget me, my Marie  
And move on  
Marie  
Ah, you've never had a new dress you could wear  
Oh Marie  
You look so pretty with a ribbon in your hair  
For too long  
You've gone without the life that I once promised you  
Right or wrong  
But today I'll find a way to make it all come true  
But if I'm not back there with you  
By the time the sun goes down  
Take the train, change your name  
And get the children out of town  
Yes, if I'm not back there with you  
By the time the sun has gone  
Forget me, my Marie  
And move on  
Forget me, my Marie  
And move on

Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee  
Tonight.  
  
For Christ is born of Mary, and gathered all above  
While mortals sleep the angels keep their watch of  
Wondering love  
Oh morning stars together, proclaim thy holy birth.  
And praises sing to God the king, and peace to men on  
Earth.  
  
Oh little town of Bethlehem, how still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep the silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth, the everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years are met in thee  
Tonight.

I know that I've stayed away for too long  
I've missed the sweet love you give me  
No other woman could warm me inside  
I need you much more  
Than I realized.  
On the wings of a silverbird  
I'm flying home to you  
On the wings of a silverbird  
I'll soon be holding you.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.  
You send me letters to help time go by  
I call your name while I'm dreaming.  
I need to feel you I long for your touch  
I wanna tell you  
I love you so much.  
On the wings ...  
I'll keep your picture  
To kiss and say good night  
But I wanna hold you forever.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.  
So wipe all those tears away  
I'm coming home to stay  
Get ready my love  
Just look up above  
For the wings of a silverbird.

Never thought I see the day  
Never thought I heard you say  
Baby, it's over I just can't take it  
Don't know what I'm gonna do  
Only want to be with you  
  
Now you, pretending I just can't fake it  
Lying here on my own, I'm trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying  
  
I'm only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Lost in an endless night  
Drowning in tears  
Only a lonely child  
Inside a lonely man  
Caught in the morning light  
Fighting the fears  
Walking down a country lane  
Getting cold in the rain  
  
Darling I can't stop remembering  
When I took your photograph  
You never used to want to laugh  
But I think your smile is the sweetest thing  
Lying here all on my own I'm trying  
Looking for some way to stop it dying

ONLY LOVE  
WRITERS MARK SPIRO, ROBBIE BUCHANAN  
I see the distant lights ahead  
Another hour or so, and I'll be back in bed  
I guess I really thought  
That I was gone for good  
But you know I never could  
I count the headlights passing by  
With every one I find  
Another reason why  
You'll be sound asleep  
And I'll look a fool  
How could I be so cruel?  
Only love could make me turn around  
And make these tears come tumbling down  
Only love  
Only love could make you stay with me  
I doubt myself but you believe  
Only love  
I wish that I could be that strong  
To see me as I am,  
And love me right or wrong  
I guess I'm still afraid  
To only say goodbye  
So I keep it all inside  
Only love...  
[Chorus]  
So I try to run, but no matter what I do  
I know it's true: I can't go on without you  
Only love...  
  

Pretty ribbon  
Writers gordon mills, mike bradley  
  
Pretty ribbon  
Tying up a little love  
Sending it along to  
Someone that I'm thinking of  
Someone very special  
Pretty ribbon  
Open it and you will find  
Something that I hope will  
Always keep me on your mind  
Even though you're far away  
One little thought in a present can say  
Just how much you mean to me  
I hope it makes your day  
Pretty ribbon  
Hoping that you'll always be  
Close to what I send you  
Part of what I send is me  
Even though you're far away  
One little thought in a present can say  
Just how much you mean to me  
I hope it makes your day  
Pretty ribbon  
Tying up a little love  
Sending it along to  
Someone that I'm thinking of

When I'm a million miles away  
There's so much I want to say  
Oh, I wish that you were here babe  
Now I got a feeling coming on  
I've been away for much too long  
Oh, I want to feel you near me  
I wish that you could hear me  
  
Red roses for my lady  
Red roses just to say  
How much I miss my baby  
And I'll be back today  
Red roses for my lady  
Red roses just for you  
  
You know they mean forever and ever  
My love will always be true  
You will be the lady of my heart  
You were the woman from the start  
Such cool sophistication  
  
You are more to me than just my girl  
You are the center of my world  
And if you like the situation  
Here's an open invitation

Please release me, let me go,  
For I don't love you anymore  
To live a lie would be a sin  
Release me and let me love again  
  
I have found a new love, dear  
And I will always want her near  
Her lips are warm while yours are cold  
Release me, darling, let me go  
  
For I don't love you anymore  
  
So release me and let me love again  
Please release me can't you see  
You'ed be a fool to clame to me,  
To live a lie would bring us pain  
So release me and let me love again

When I say goodnight in your little room  
Ah, that's the time I love you best of all  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
The shadow of your smile is on the wall  
But I can see the reason, it's just your way of teasin'  
But my, oh, my, my, my, I'll take it all  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
The only place where we can be alone  
When I say goodnight in your little room  
To hold you close this way, you say is wrong  
But I can see no reason, why you should keep on teasin'  
If you don't stop, our love just can't go on  
But I can see no reason, why you should keep on teasin'  
Why can't we let the night just linger on  

There's a new wind blowin' like I never known  
I'm breathin' deeper than I've ever done  
And it sure feels good to finally feel the way I do  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I'm lettin' go of all my lonely yesterdays  
Forgiven myself for the mistakes I've made  
There's just one thing, the only thing I need to do  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I wanna feel sunshine  
Shinin' down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
Let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do  
  
I'm runnin' 'round in circles goin' no-where fast  
I'd take one step forward and then two steps back  
Couldn't walk a straight line even if I wanted to  
Yeah, I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I wanna feel sunshine  
Shinin' down on me and you  
When you put your arms around me  
Let me know there's nothing in this world I can't do  
  
Sometimes it's hard for me to really understand  
But you're teachin' me to be a better man  
Don't want to take this life for granted like I used to do  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you  
  
I wanna love somebody, love somebody like you, like you  
Love somebody, love somebody like you  
Yeah, baby, like you, like you  
Somebody like you

You ask me if I love you and I choke on my reply  
I'd rather hurt you honestly than mislead you with a lie  
And who am I to judge you on what you say or do  
I'm only just beginning to see the real you  
And sometimes when we touch  
The honesty's too much and I have to close my eyes and hide  
I wanna hold you till I die  
Till we both break down and cry  
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides  
  
Romance and all it's strategy leaves me battling with my pride  
But through the insecurity some tenderness survives  
I'm just another writer, still trapped within my truths  
A hesitant prize fighter still trapped within my youth  
  
And sometimes when we touch  
The honesty's too much and I have to close my eyes and  
  
hide  
I wanna hold you till I die  
Till we both break down and cry  
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides  
  
At times I'd like to break you and drag you to your knees  
At times I'd like to break through and hold you endlessly  
At times I understand you and I know how hard you've tried  
I've watch while love commands you  
And I've watched love pass you by  
At times I think we're drifters, still searching for a friend  
A brother or a sister, but then the passion flares again  
  
And sometimes when we touch  
The honesty's too much and I have to close my eyes and hide  
I wanna hold you till I die  
Till we both break down and cry  
I want to hold you till the fear in me subsides

Blue Spanish eyes  
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes  
Please, please don't cry  
  
This is just adios and not goodbye  
Soon I'll return  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si, si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
  
Blue Spanish eyes  
Prettiest eyes in all of Mexico  
True Spanish eyes  
  
Please smile at me once more before I go  
Soon I'll return  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si, si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  

When the night has come  
And the land is dark .  
And the moon is the only light we'll see  
No I won't be afraid, no I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  
And darling, darling, stand by me, oh now, now stand by me  
Stand by me, stand by me  
If the sky that we look upon  
Should tumble and fall  
And the mountains should crumble to the sea  
I won't cry, I won't cry, no I won't shed a tear  
Just as long as you stand, stand by me  
And darling, darling, stand by me, oh stand by me  
Stand by me, stand by me, stand by me-e, yeah  
Whenever you're in trouble won't you stand by me, oh now, now stand by me  
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me  
Darling, darling, stand by me-e, stand by me  
Oh stand by me, stand by me, stand by me

Strangers in the night  
Writers bert kaempfert, charles singleton, eddie snyder  
  
Strangers in the night exchanging glances Wond'ring in the night What were the
chances we'd be sharing love Before the night was through. Something in your
eyes was so inviting, Something in you smile was so exciting, Something in my
heart, Told me I must have you. Strangers in the night, two lonely people We
were strangers in the night Up to the moment When we said our first hello.
Little did we know Love was just a glance away, A warm embracing dance away
and...... Ever since that night we've been together. Lovers at first sight, in
love forever. It turned out so right, For strangers in the night. La da da da
da.......

Tonight we're listening to the sweetest song  
Tonight the melodies go on and on  
We'll dream of love and the days gone by  
Then we sail to dawn  
  
And the lights of love will feel the sky  
Nobody loves you like I do, sweet lady Jane  
Nobody feels the way I do, may I explain  
I'll jump a train, I'll steal an airplane  
To be with you  
  
I'll fight a samuraj if he made you cry  
Am I getting through ?  
  
Tonight, I watched the people standing still  
Tonight, it's almost like I want them there  
I don't mind a bit  
  
You're a, just as long as I know the lady will be going home with me  
Nobody loves you quite the same  
Nobody loves you more, my lady Jane

If your heart tells you so, that you should leave me  
Don't try to forget, you and I never met  
And before you fly, why can't you tell me why  
You've forgotten all the words that you once said  
  
Long as I've got you there beside me  
Long as you're there to stand a guide me  
The love we share, no one can ever tear apart  
Long as I've got this life I'm living  
Long as it's you, the love I'm with then  
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart  
  
If my love for you can't make you happy  
Just open the door and you won't see me anymore  
And before you fly, why can't you tell me why  
You've forgotten all the words that you once said  
  
Long as I've got you there beside me  
Long as you're there to stand a guide me  
The love we share, no one can ever tear apart  
Long as I've got this life I'm living  
Long as it's you, the love I'm with then  
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart  
I'll keep on callin' you sweetheart

You say you're finished with love  
That you'll never love again as long as you live  
But believe me, you'll love me again  
If for once you find it in your heart to forgive  
Take my Heart  
I can undo all the wrong, let's start  
Just a little bit of love goes far  
You'll begin to live again  
Take my heart, come on back where you belong  
Let's start, you can do it, if you take my heart  
You'll begin to live again  
  
Now that you've seen the bad side  
There's a chance that you won't find the heart to forgive  
But believe me, there's always the good side  
In a world just made for us where lovers can live  
  
Take my heart, I can undo all the wrong, let's start  
Just a little bit of love, goes far, you'll begin to live again  
  
Take my heart, come on back where you belong, let's start  
You can do it if you take my heart, you'll begin to live again  
  
  
  

If you want something to play with  
Go and find yourself a toy  
Baby my time is too expensive  
And I'm not a little boy  
If you are serious  
Don't play with my heart it makes me furious  
But if want me to love you  
Then baby I will girl you know I will  
Tell it like it is  
Don't be ashamed to let your conscience be your guide  
But I I I I I know deep down inside of me  
I believe you love me, forget your foolish pride  
Life is too short to have sorrow  
You may be here today and gone tomorrow  
You might as well get what you want  
So go on and live, baby, go on and live  
Tell it like it is I'm nothin' to play with, go and find yourself a toy  
But I-I-I-I-I  
Tell it like it is  
My time is too expensive  
And I'm not your little boy  
Mm mm, tell it like it is

I have a band of men and all they do is play for me  
They come from miles around to hear them play a melody  
Beneath the stars my ten guitars will play a song for you  
And if you're with the one you love this is what you do  
  
Oh, dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
And very soon you know just where you are  
Through the eyes of love you see a thousand stars  
When you dance, dance, dance, to my ten guitars  
  
Guitars are made for love my band of men will always say  
So give each one a pretty girl and they will start to play  
Beneath the stars my ten guitars will play a song for you  
And if you're with the one you love this is what to do  
  
Oh, dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
And very soon you know just where you are  
Through the eyes of love you see a thousand stars  
When you dance, dance, dance, to my ten guitars  
  
Ooh, let me tell you now  
Dance, dance, dance to my ten guitars  
Hmm, come on, everybody,  
Dance dance dance to my ten guitars

I wondered should I go or should I stay,  
The band had only one more song to play.  
And then I saw you out the corner of my eye,  
A little girl, alone and so shy.  
  
I had the last waltz with you,  
Two lonely people together.  
I fell in love with you,  
The last waltz should last forever.  
  
But the love we had was going strong,  
Through the good and bad we get along.  
And then the flame of love died in your eye,  
My heart was broke in two when you said goodbye.  
  
I had the last waltz with you,  
Two lonely people together.  
I fell in love with you,  
The last waltz should last forever.  
  
It's all over now, nothing left to say,  
Just my tears and the orchestra playing.  
  
La la la la la la la la la,  
La la la la la la la la la.  
  
I had the last waltz with you,  
Two lonely people together.  
I fell in love with you,  
The last waltz should last forever.  
  
La la la la la la la la la.

Lonely table just for one  
In a bright and crowded room  
While the music has begun  
I drink to memories in the gloom  
Though the music's still the same  
It has a bittersweet refrain  
  
So play the song the way it used to be  
Before she left and changed it all to sadness  
And maybe if she's passing by the window  
She will hear a love song  
And a melody  
And even if the words are not so tender  
She will always remember  
The way it used to be  
  
Friends stop by and say hello  
And I laugh and hide the pain  
It's quite easy 'til they go  
Then the song begins again  
  
So play the song the way it used to be  
Before she left and changed it all to sadness  
And maybe if she's passing by the window  
She will hear a love song  
And a melody  
And even if the words are not so tender  
She will always remember  
The way it used to be

There's a kind of hush all over the world, tonight  
All over the world, you can hear the sounds of lovers in love  
You know what I mean, just the two of us and nobody else concerned  
There's nobody else and I'm feeling good, holding you tight  
  
So listen very carefully  
Closer now and you will see what I mean, it isn't a dream  
The only sound that you will hear  
Is when I whisper in your ear, "I love you, forever and ever"  
  
There's a kind of hush all over the world, tonight  
All over the world, people just like us are falling in love  
  
So listen very carefully  
Closer now and you will see what I mean, no no, it isn't a dream  
The only sound that you will hear  
Is when I whisper in your ear, "I love you, forever and ever"  
  
There's a kind of hush all over the world, tonight  
All over the world, people just like us are falling in love  
Are falling in love, falling in love

You see this guy  
This guy's in love with you  
Yes, I'm in love  
I love you the way I do  
When you smile I can tell  
We know each other very well  
How can I show you? I plan  
I got to know you 'cos I heard some talk  
They say you think I'm fine  
Yes, I'm in love  
And what I do to make you mine  
Tell me now, is it so?  
Don't let me be the last to know  
My hands are shaking  
Don't let my heart keep breaking cos  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say you're in love  
In love with this guy  
If not I'll just die  
Tell me now, is it so?  
Don't let me be the last to know  
My hands are shaking  
Don't let my heart keep breaking cos  
I need your love, I want your love  
Say you're in love  
In love, with this guy  
If not I'll just die  

Once upon a time there was a tavern  
Where we used to raise a glass or two  
Remember how we laughed away the hours  
And dreamed of all the great things we would do  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
Those were the days  
Oh yes, those were the days  
Then the busy years went rushing by us  
We lost our starry notions on the way  
If by chance, I'd see you in the tavern  
We'd smile at one another, and we'd say  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
Those were the days  
Oh yes, those were the days  
Just tonight I stood before the tavern  
Nothing seemed the way it used to be  
In the glass I saw a strange reflection  
Was that lonely man really me  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
La la la la....  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
La la la la....  
Through the door there came familiar laughter  
I saw your face and heard you call my name  
Oh, my friend, we're older but no wiser  
For in our hearts the dreams are still the same  
Those were the days, my friend  
We thought they'd never end  
We'd sing and dance forever and a day  
We'd live the life we choose, we'd fight and never lose  
For we were young and sure to have our way  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
La la la la....  
La la la la la la, La la la la la la  
La la la la....

To the ends of the Earth  
I'll follow my star  
To the ends of the Earth  
Just to be where you are  
  
No matter where you roam  
I'll never be far behind  
Who cares  
Where the path may wind  
As long as I find you?  
  
Though the melody dies  
The song lingers on  
And a thousand goodbyes  
Won't convince me  
You're gone  
  
I'll follow you, my love  
You'll never be free  
To the ends of the Earth  
Till you've given  
Your love to me  
  
No matter where you roam  
I'll never be far behind  
Who cares  
Where the path may wind  
As long as I find you?  
  
Though the melody dies  
The song lingers on  
And a thousand goodbyes  
Won't convince me  
You're gone  
  
I'll follow you, my love  
You'll never be free  
To the ends of the Earth  
Till you've given  
Your love to me

The days of autumn splendor  
Those moments warm and tender  
Was it to beautiful to last?  
The love we shared together  
The dreams we dared together  
Was it to beautiful to last?  
  
Walking hand in hand  
The dawn discloses we  
Were dreaming of a land  
Where love reposes  
But castles made of sand  
Like winter roses  
Are fated to die  
My darling, like you and I  
My darling...  
  
Where are those sweet Septembers  
The joy my heart remembers?  
Lost in the shadows of the past  
The rainbow watched above you  
The sacred words, I love you  
Why did the dream go by so fast?  
  
Walking hand in hand  
The dawn discloses we  
Were dreaming of a land  
Where love reposes  
But castles made of sand  
Like winter roses  
Are fated to die  
My darling, like you and I  
My darling...  
  
Where are those sweet Septembers  
The joy my heart remembers?  
Lost in the shadows of the past  
The rainbow watched above you  
The sacred words, I love you  
Why did that dream go by so fast?  
Was it to beautiful...  
Was it to beautiful to last?

Two different worlds  
We live in two different worlds  
For we've been told  
That a love like ours could never be  
So far apart  
They say we're so far apart  
And that we haven't the right  
To change our destiny  
  
When will they learn  
That a heart doesn't draw the line  
Nothing matters if I am yours  
And you are mine  
  
Two different worlds  
We live in two different worlds  
But we will show them  
As we walk together in the sun  
That our two different worlds are one  
  
Two different worlds  
We live in two different worlds  
But we will show them  
As we walk together in the sun  
That our two different worlds are one

WALK HAND IN HAND  
WRITER JOHNNY COWELL  
Walk hand in hand with me through all eternity Have faith, believe in me, give
me your hand Love is a symphony of perfect harmony When lovers such as we walk
hand in hand Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while So lift your head
up high and look toward the sky Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny
No greater love could be, walk hand in hand Walk with me instrumental
interlude Be not afraid, for I am with you all the while So lift your head up
high and look up to the sky Walk hand in hand with me, this is our destiny No
greater love could be, walk hand in hand Walk with me  
  

When I fall in love  
It will be forever  
Or I'll never fall in love  
  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before it's begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
  
When I give my heart  
It will be completely  
Or I'll never give my heart  
  
And the moment I can feel that  
You feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you  
  
And the moment I can feel that  
You feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you

I walk along an empty street  
And night becomes another dawn  
It's only heartaches that I meet  
And tears that tell me you have gone from me  
  
Is it hard to see that my heart is breaking  
It was yours for the taking  
You said we're through  
What can I do when there's no you  
  
This kind of lonliness I found  
Has taken over in my mind  
And it will always be around  
For love like ours, I'll never find, I know  
  
Did you have to go cause my heart is breaking  
It was yours for the taking  
You said we're through  
What can I do when there's no you  
  
My heart is breaking  
It was yours for the taking  
You said we're through  
What can I do when there's no you
