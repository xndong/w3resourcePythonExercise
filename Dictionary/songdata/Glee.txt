It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel all right  
  
You know I work all day  
To get you money to buy you things  
And it's worth it just to hear you say  
?You're gonna give me everything?  
  
So why on earth should I moan?  
'Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel all right  
  
When I'm home  
Everything seems to be right  
When I'm home  
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah  
  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel okay, oh!  
  
So why on earth should I moan?  
'Cause when I get you alone  
You know I feel all right  
  
When I'm home  
Everything seems to be right  
When I'm home  
Feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah  
  
It's been a hard day's night  
And I've been working like a dog  
It's been a hard day's night  
I should be sleeping like a log  
  
But when I get home to you  
I find the things that you do  
Will make me feel all right  
You know I feel all right

When I was young  
I never needed anyone  
And making love was just for fun  
Those days are gone  
Living alone  
I think of all the friends I've known  
When I dial the telephone  
Nobody's home  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
Hard to be sure...  
Sometimes I feel so insecure  
And loves so distant and obscure  
Remains the cure  
  
All by myself  
Don't wanna be  
All by myself  
Anymore  
All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
All by myself  
Anymore  
  
When I was young  
I never needed anyone

All by myself  
Don't wanna live  
Oh  
Don't wanna live  
By myself, by myself

I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There's just one thing I need  
I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas  
Is you  
  
I don't want a lot for Christmas  
There is just one thing I need  
I don't care about presents  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
I don't need to hang my stocking  
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy  
With a toy on Christmas day  
I just want you for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
All I want for Christmas is you  
You baby  
  
I won't ask for much this Christmas

I'm just gonna keep on waiting  
Underneath the mistletoe  
I won't make a list and send it  
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to  
Hear those magic reindeer click  
'Cause I just want you here tonight  
Holding on to me so tight  
What more can I do  
Baby all I want for Christmas is you  
You  
  
All the lights are shining  
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children's  
Laughter fills the air  
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need  
won't you please bring my baby to me  
  
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas  
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see baby  
Standing right outside my door  
Oh I just want him for my own  
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true  
Baby all I want for Christmas is  
You  
  
All I want for Christmas is you baby (repeat)

I hear the ticking of the clock  
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark  
I wonder where you are tonight  
No answer on the telephone  
And the night goes by so very slow  
Oh I hope that it won't end though  
Alone  
  
Till now I always got by on my own  
I never really cared until I met you  
And now it chills me to the bone  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
You don't know how long I have wanted  
To touch your lips and hold you tight  
You don't know how long I have waited  
And I was going to tell you tonight  
But the secret is still my own  
And my love for you is still unknown  
Alone  
  
Aah aah aah  
  
Till now I always got by on my own  
I never really cared until I met you  
And now it chills me to the bone  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
Alone, alone  
  
I hear the ticking of the clock  
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark

Anita  
Puerto rico  
My heart's devotion  
Let it sink back in the ocean  
Always the hurricanes blowing  
Always the population growing  
And the money owing  
And the sunlight streaming

Some people stay far away from the door  
If there's a chance of it opening up  
They hear a voice in the hall outside  
And hope that it just passes by  
  
Some people live with the fear of a touch  
And the anger of having been a fool  
They will not listen to anyone  
So nobody tells them a lie  
  
I know you're only protecting yourself  
I know you're thinking of somebody else  
Someone who hurt you  
But I'm not above  
Making up for the love  
You've been denying you could ever feel  
I'm not above doing anything  
To restore your faith if I can  
Some people see through the eyes of the old  
Before they ever get a look at the young  
I'm only willing to hear you cry  
Because I am an innocent man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
  
Some people say they will never believe  
Another promise they hear in the dark  
Because they only remember too well  
They heard somebody tell them before  
  
Some people sleep all alone every night  
Instead of taking a lover to bed  
Some people find that it's easier to hate  
Than to wait anymore  
  
I know you don't want to hear what I say  
I know you're gonna keep turning away  
But I've been there and if I can survive  
I can keep you alive  
I'm not above going through it again  
  
And although this is a  
Fight I  
Can lose  
The accused is an  
Innocent  
Man  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
I am an innocent man  
Oh yes I am  
An innocent man  
Oh....

And I am telling you  
I'm not going  
You're the best man  
I'll ever know  
There's no way I can ever go  
No No there's no way  
No No No No way I'm livin without you  
I'm not livin without you  
I don't want to be free  
I'm staying I'm stayin  
And you and you  
You're gonna love me  
Yeah ohh  
You're gonna love me  
  
And I am telling you  
I'm not going  
Even though there rough times are showin  
There's just no way  
There's no way  
  
Were part of the same place  
Were part of the same time  
We both share the same blood  
We both have the same mind  
  
And time and time  
We've had so much to share  
No No No No No way  
I'm not waking up tomorrow morning  
And finding that there's nobody left  
  
Darlin' there's no way  
No No no no way  
I'm livin' without you  
I'm not living without you  
You see there's no way  
There's no way  
  
Tear down the mountain  
Just scream and shout  
You can say what you want  
I'm not walking out  
  
Stop all the rivers  
Push, strike and kill  
I'm not gonna leave ya  
There's no way I will  
  
And I am telling you  
I'm not going  
You're the best man  
I'll ever know  
There's no way I can ever ever go  
  
No No No no way  
No No no way I'm living without you  
I'm not living without ya now  
Living without ya

Moment to let you know  
I don't wanna let you go  
But now I realize  
There's just no perfect time  
To confess how I feel  
This much I know is real  
So I refuse to  
Waste one more second without you  
Knowing my heart  
  
Baby cause I don't  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
I'm incomplete  
When you're not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldn't even care  
As long as you're there  
  
Take these words  
Don't let them go unheard  
This is me reaching out  
I hope you can hear me now  
This pain in my heart stands stay  
Taking is yours to break  
Having to try and lose  
Then keep this love from you  
So I refuse to  
Waste one more second  
Without you  
Knowing my heart  
  
Baby cause I don't  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
I'm incomplete  
When you're not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldn't even care  
As long as you're there  
  
Each day  
And Night  
That I  
Kept it a secret  
And it killed me  
It's time  
To share what I feel inside  
  
I don't  
Need anything else but your love  
Nothing but you means a thing to me  
I'm incomplete  
When you're not there  
Holding me touching me  
I swear  
All of the risk would just disappear  
And I wouldn't even care  
As long as you're there  
As long as you're there

Oh baby, baby  
Oh baby, baby  
Oh baby, baby  
How was I supposed to know  
That something wasn't right here  
Oh baby baby  
I shouldn't have let you go  
And now you're out of sight, yeah  
Show me, how you want it to be  
Tell me baby  
'Cause I need to know now what we've got  
  
My loneliness is killing me  
I must confess, I still believe  
When I'm not with you I lose my mind  
Give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
Oh baby, baby  
The reason I breathe is you  
Boy you got me blinded  
Oh baby, baby  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
That's not the way I planned it  
Show me, how you want it to be  
Tell me baby  
'Cause I need to know now what we've got  
  
Oh baby, baby  
Oh baby, baby  
Ah, yeah, yeah  
Oh baby, baby  
How was I supposed to know  
Oh pretty baby  
I shouldn't have let you go  
I must confess, that my loneliness  
Is killing me now  
Don't you know I still believe  
That you will be here  
And give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
I must confess that my loneliness  
Is killing me now  
Don't you know I still believe  
That you will be here  
And give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time

He left no time to regret  
Kept his dick wet with his same old safe bet  
Me and my head high  
And my tears dry, get on without my guy  
You went back to what you knew  
So far removed from all that we went through  
And I tread a troubled track  
My odds are stacked, I'll go back to black  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
I go back to us  
I love you much  
It's not enough, you love blow and I love puff  
And life is like a pipe  
And I'm a tiny penny rolling up the walls inside  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
Black, black, black, black  
Black, black, black...  
I go back to  
I go back to  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to  
We only said goodbye with words  
I died a hundred times  
You go back to her  
And I go back to black

So this ain't the end, I saw you again today  
Had to turn my heart away  
You smiled like the Sun, kisses for everyone  
And tales, it never fails!  
  
You lying so low in the weeds  
Bet you gonna ambush me  
You'd have me down, down, down to my knees  
Wouldn't you, Barracuda?  
  
Back over time when we were all trying for free  
Met up with porpoise and me  
No right no wrong you're selling a song, a name  
Whisper game  
  
If the real thing don't do the trick  
You better make up something quick  
You gonna burn it out to the wick  
Aren't you, Barracuda?  
  
"Sell me sell you" the porpoise said  
Dive down deep to save my head  
You, I think you got the blues too.  
  
All that night and all the next  
Swam without looking back  
Made for the western pools, silly fools!

Your story's sad to tell  
A teenage ne'er do well  
Most mixed up no-delinquent on the block  
Your futures so unclear now  
What's left of your career now  
Can't even get a trade in on your smile  
  
Beauty school dropout  
No graduation day for you  
Beauty school dropout  
Missed your mid-terms and flunked shampoo  
Well at least you could have taken time to wash and clean  
Your clothes up  
After spending all that dough to have the doctor fix you nose up  
  
Baby get moving (Better get movin)  
Why keep your feeble hopes alive  
What are you proving (What are you provin)  
You've got the dream but not the drive  
  
If you go for your diploma you will join a steno pool  
Turn in your teasin comb and go back to high school  
  
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)  
Hanging around the corner store  
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)  
It's about time you knew the score  
  
Well they couldn't teach you anything you think you're such a looker  
But no customer would go to you unless she was a hooker  
  
Baby don't sweat it (Don't sweat it)  
You're not cut out to hold a job  
Better forget it (Forget it)  
Who wants their hair done by a slob?  
  
Now your bangs are curled your lashes whirled but still the world is cruel  
Wipe off that angel face and go back to high school  
  
Baby don't blow it  
Don't put my good advice to shame  
Baby you know it  
Even Dear Abby'd say the same  
  
Now I've called the shot, get off the block, I really gotta fly  
Gotta be going to that malt shop in the sky  
  
[Repeat x3]  
Beauty school dropout (Beauty school dropout)  
Go back to high school

I had a dream so big and loud  
I jumped so high I touched the clouds  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
I stretched my hands out to the sky  
We danced with monsters through the night  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
  
I'm never gonna look back  
Woah, never gonna give it up  
No, please don't wake me now  
  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
  
I howled at the moon with friends  
And then the sun came crashing in  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
But all the possibilities  
No limits just epiphanies  
Wo-o-o-o-o-oh [x2]  
  
I'm never gonna look back  
Woah, never gonna give it up  
No, just don't wake me now  
  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
Oo-o-o-o-oo  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
  
I hear it calling outside my window  
I feel it in my soul (soul)  
The stars were burning so bright  
The sun was out 'til midnight  
I say we lose control (control)  
  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
Oo-o-o-o-o  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife  
This is gonna be, this is gonna be, this is gonna be  
The best day of my life  
Everything is looking up, everybody up now  
This is gonna be the best day of my li-ife  
My li-i-i-i-i-ife

Beth I hear you calling  
But I can't come home right now  
Me and the boys are playing  
And we just can't find the sound  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
You say you feel so empty  
That our house just ain't our home  
I'm always somewhere else  
And you're always there alone  
  
Just a few more hours  
And I'll be right home to you  
I think I hear them calling  
Oh Beth what can I do  
Beth what can I do  
  
Beth I know you're lonely  
And I hope you'll be alright  
'Cause me and the boys  
Will be playing all night

I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine  
Smilin' next to Oprah and the Queen  
  
Oh every time I close my eyes  
I see my name in shining lights  
Yeah, a different city every night oh  
I swear the world better prepare for when I'm a billionaire  
  
Yeah I would have a show like Oprah  
I would be the host of, everyday Christmas  
Give Artie a wish list  
I'd probably pull an Angelina and Brad Pitt  
And adopt a bunch of babies that ain't never had it  
Give away a few Mercedes like here lady have this  
And last but not least grant somebody their last wish  
It's been a couple months that I've been single so  
You can call me Artie Claus minus the Ho Ho  
Get it, hehe, I'd probably visit where Katrina hit  
And damn sure do a lot more than FEMA did  
Yeah can't forget about me stupid  
Everywhere I go I'ma have my own theme music  
  
Oh every time I close my eyes  
I see my name in shining lights  
A different city every night oh I  
I swear the world better prepare  
For when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
Oh ooh oh ooh for when I'm a billionaire  
  
I'll be playing basketball with the President  
Dunking on his delegates  
Then I'll compliment him on his political etiquette  
Toss a couple milli in the air just for the heck of it  
But keep the fives, twentys, tens and bens completely separate  
And yeah I'll be in a whole new tax bracket  
We in recession but let me take a crack at it  
I'll probably take whatevers left and just split it up  
So everybody that I love can have a couple bucks  
And not a single tummy around me would know what hungry was  
Eating good sleeping soundly  
I know we all have a similar dream  
Go in your pocket pull out your wallet  
And put it in the air and sing  
  
I wanna be a billionaire so freakin' bad  
Buy all of the things I never had  
I wanna be on the cover of Forbes magazine

At first we started out real cool  
Taking me places I ain't never been  
But now you're getting comfortable  
Ain't doing those things you did no more  
You're slowly making me pay for things  
Your money should be handling  
  
And now you ask to use my car  
Drive it all day and don't fill up the tank  
And you have the audacity  
To even come and step to me  
Ask to hold some money from me  
Until you get your check next week  
  
You triflin' good for nothing type of brother  
Silly me why haven't I found another?  
A baller when times get hard

Instead of a scrub like you  
Who don't know what a man's about  
  
Can you pay my bills?

Do you pay my automo' bills?

Now you've been maxing out my card  
Gave me bad credit buyin' me gifts with my own ends  
Haven't paid the first bill  
But instead you're headin' to the mall  
Goin' on shopping sprees  
Perpetrating to your friends like you be ballin'  
  
And then you use my cell phone  
Callin' whoever that you thinks at home  
And then when the bill comes  
All of a sudden you be acting dumb  
Don't know where none of these calls come from  
When your momma's number's here more than once

Take these broken wings and learn to fly.  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to arise.

Take these sunken eyes and learn to see.  
All your life you were only waiting for this moment to be free.

I'll have a blue Christmas without you  
I'll be so blue just thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't be the same, if you're not here with me  
  
And when those blue snowflakes start falling  
That's when those blue memories start calling  
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue, blue, blue, blue Christmas  
  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't be the same, if you're not here with me  
  
I'll have a blue Christmas, that' certain  
And when the blue heartache stops hurting  
You'll be doing alright with your Christmas of white  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

Before I was born late one night,  
My Papa said everything's alright  
The doctor laughed,when mama laid down,  
With a stomach bouncing all around  
Mama gave birth to the hand-jive  
  
I could barely walk when I milked a cow  
When I was three, I pushed a plow  
While chopping wood I moved my legs,  
And I started dancing while I gathered eggs  
Townfolk clapped, I was only five  
he'll out dance em' all  
"He's a born hand-jive!"  
  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah - everybody!  
  
Born to hand-jive, baby,  
Born to hand-jive baby- yeah!  
  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
How low can you go?  
  
Higher, higher, higher and higher  
Now can you hand-jive, baby?  
Oh can you hand-jive, baby?  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah  
Born to hand-jive, oh yeah!

This here's a tale for all the fellas  
Try to do what those ladies tell us  
Get shot down cause you're over zealous  
Play hard to get an females get jealous  
OK smartie, go to a party  
Girls are skantilly clad and showin' body  
A chick walks by you wish you could sex her  
But you're standin' on the wall like you was Poindexter  
New movie's showin' so you're goin'  
Could care less about the five you're blowin'  
Theater gets dark just to start the show  
When you spot a fine woman sittin' in the front row  
She's dressed in yellow, she says "Hello,  
Come sit next to me you fine fellow"  
You run over there without a second to loose  
And what comes next, hey bust a move  
  
If you want it baby you've got it (repeat)  
Just bust a move  
If you want it baby you've got it (repeat)  
  
Your best friend Harry has a brother Larry  
In five days from now he's gonna marry  
He's hopin' you can make it there if you can  
Cause in the ceremony you'll be the best man  
You say "neato" check your libido  
And roll to the church in your new tuxedo  
The bride walks down just to start the wedding  
And there's one more girl you won't be getting  
So you start thinkin', then you start blinkin'  
A bride maid looks and thinks that you're winkin'  
She thinks you're kinda cute so she winks back  
And now you're feelin' really fine cus the girl is stacked  
Reception's jumpin', bass is pumpin'  
Look at the girl and your heart starts thumpin'  
Says she wants to dance to a different groove  
Now you know what to do just, bust a move  
  
If you want it baby you've got it  
If you want it baby you've got it  
Just bust a move  
If you want it baby you've got it  
If you want it baby you've got it

I bust the windows out your car  
And it didn't mend my broken heart  
I'll probably always have these ugly scars  
But right now I don't care about that part.  
I bust the windows out your car  
After I saw you looking right at her  
I didn't wanna but I took my turn  
I'm glad I did it cause you had to learn  
  
I must admit it helped a little bit  
To think of how you'd felt when you saw it  
I didn't know that I had that much strength  
But I'm glad you see what happens when  
You see you can't just play with peoples feelings  
Tell them you love them and don't mean it  
You'll probably say that it was juvenile  
But I think that I deserve to smile ha, ha, ha, ha,  
  
I bust the windows out ya car  
You know I did it cause I left my mark  
Wrote my initials with the crowbar  
And then I drove off into the dark  
  
I bust the windows out ya car ha,  
You should feel lucky that was all I did  
After five whole years of this bullshit  
Gave you all of me and you played with it  
  
I must admit it helped a little bit  
To think of how you'd feel when you saw it  
I didn't know that I had that much strength  
But I'm glad you see what happens when  
You see you can't just play with peoples feelings  
Tell them you love them but don't mean it  
You probably say that it was juvenile  
But I think that I deserve to smile  
Bust windows out your car  
But it don't come back to my broken heart  
You could neva' feel I how I felt that day  
Until it happens baby you don't know pain  
Ooh Yeah I did it (yeah I did it)  
You should know it (you should know it)  
I ain't sorry (I ain't sorry)  
You deserved it (you deserved it)  
After what you did to me (after what you did)  
You deserve it (you deserve it)  
I ain't sorry no no oh (I ain't sorry)  
You broke my heart so I broke you car  
You caused me pain (you caused me pain)  
(So I did the same)  
Even though what you did to me was much worse  
I had to do something to make you hurt  
Oh but why am I still crying  
Why am I the one who's still crying  
Oh oh you really hurt me baby  
You really, you really hurt me baby  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey  
Now watch me you  
Now watch me  
Oh I bust the windows out your car.

I threw a wish in the well  
Don't ask me, I'll never tell  
I looked to you as it fell  
And now you're in my way  
  
I trade my soul for a wish  
Pennies and dimes for a kiss  
I wasn't looking for this  
But now you're in my way  
Your stare was holding  
Ripped jeans, skin was showing  
Hot night, wind was blowing  
Where you think you're going baby?  
  
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy  
But here's my number, so call me maybe  
It's hard to look right, at you baby  
But here's my number, so call me maybe  
  
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy  
But here's my number, so call me maybe  
And all the other boys, try to chase me  
But here's my number, so call me maybe  
  
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
I missed you so bad... I missed you so, so bad  
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
And you should know that... I missed you so, so bad  
  
It's hard to look right, at you baby  
But here's my number, so call me maybe  
  
Hey, I just met you, and this is crazy  
But here's my number, so call me maybe  
And all the other boys, try to chase me,

Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
I missed you so bad... I missed you so, so bad  
Before you came into my life I missed you so bad  
And you should know that  
So call me maybe

Kurt: The powerlines went out, and I am all alone.  
I don't really care at all not anwsering my phone  
  
Blaine: All the games you played, the promises you made  
Couldn't finish what you started only darkness still remains  
  
All: Lost sight  
Couldn't see, when it was you and me  
  
Chorus:  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
I'm begining to see the light  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
But I think I'll be alright  
  
Been black and blue before  
There's no need to explaine  
I am not the jaded kind  
Play back's such a waste  
You're invisible  
Invisible to me  
My wish is coming true  
Erase the memory of your face  
  
Lost sight, couldn't see  
When it was you and me  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
I'm begining to see the light  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
But I think I'll be alright  
  
Kurt: Someday  
You will wake up  
With nothing but you're sorry  
  
Blaine: And someday  
You will get back  
Everything you gave  
All: Me  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
I'm begining to see the light  
  
Blow the candles out  
Looks like a solo tonight  
But I think I'll be all right

Oh make me over  
I'm all I wanna be  
A walking study  
In Demonology  
  
Hey, so glad you could make it  
Yeah, now you've really made it  
Hey, so glad you can make it now  
  
Oh look at my face  
My name is might have been  
  
My name is never was  
My name's forgotten  
  
Hey, so glad you could make it  
Yeah, now you've really made it  
Hey, there's only us left now  
  
When I wake up (in my makeup)  
It's too early for that dress  
Wilted and faded (somewhere in Hollywood)  
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh  
  
No second billing cause you're a star now  
Oh Cinderella, they aren't sluts like you  
  
Beautiful garbage, beautiful dresses  
Can you stand up or will you just fall down?  
  
You better watch out  
Oh what you wish for  
It better be worth it  
So much to die for  
  
Hey, so glad you could make it  
Yeah, now you've really made it  
Hey, there's only us left now  
  
When I wake up (in my makeup)  
Have you ever felt (so used up as this?)  
  
It's all so sugarless  
(Hooker, waitress)  
Model, actress  
(Oh just go nameless)  
  
Honeysuckle  
She's full of poison  
She obliterated everything she kissed  
  
Now she's fading somewhere in Hollywood  
I'm glad I came here with your pound of flesh  
  
You want a part of me  
Well I'm not selling cheap  
No, I'm not selling cheap

I've made up my mind,  
Don't need to think it over,  
If I'm wrong I am right,  
Don't need to look no further,  
This ain't lust,  
I know this is love but,  
  
If I tell the world,  
I'll never say enough,  
Cause it was not said to you,  
And that's exactly what I need to do,  
If I'm in love with you,  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
I'd build myself up,  
  
And fly around in circles,  
Wait then as my heart drops,  
And my back begins to tingle  
Finally could this be it  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere  
  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere,  
Or would it be a waste?  
Even If I knew my place should I leave it there?  
Should I give up,  
Or should I just keep chasing pavements?  
Even if it leads nowhere

I never saw a reindeer fly  
Make it's way across the sky  
But I know if I close my eyes my wishes will come true  
Like the one I've saved for you  
  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Don't care it's cold outside  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
Through the good times and bad  
Happy and sad  
I'm still holding on  
I know what I have  
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you  
With you, yeah  
  
The simple things like goin' home  
And friends they say you're not alone  
Songs of joy they keep you strong make everything okay  
Oh and Santa's on his way (on his way) yeah  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Don't care it's cold outside  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
Through the good times and bad  
The happy and sad  
I'm still holding on  
I know what I have  
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
The sleigh bells are ringing, they're getting real close  
I think I hear Rudolph  
Just up the road  
Candle lights and hearts full of hope  
The stars shining bright some things never change  
  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
My arms are open wide  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
Through the good times and bad  
The happy and sad  
I'm still holding on  
I know what I have  
And all that I want is Christmas eve with you  
  
Let it snow, let it snow  
The fire's burning bright  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
I'll keep you warm tonight  
It's not just the gifts  
Under my tree  
The best things in life  
Are totally free  
And waitin' for me is Christmas eve with you  
Is Christmas eve with you

Mercedes:  
When the world is seeing yellow  
I only see gray  
When everybody sees the rainbow  
I'm stuck in the rain  
You take a little piece of me  
Every time you leave  
I don't think that I'll  
Ever find that silver lining  
Or a reason to smile  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now I'm colour blind, colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind, never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Always black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind  
  
Ain't it funny that you managed  
To just wash away  
Even pictures that you're not in  
Have started to fade  
I try to play my favorite songs  
But I can't sing along  
The words don't feel the same  
You've taken all the best things from me  
And thrown them away  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now I'm colour blind, colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind, never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Always black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind  
  
I'll wait  
For roses to be red again  
And I hate  
That you took my blue from the ocean  
Give me back green greens and goldens  
My purples, my blues, you stole them  
How long will I be broken?  
  
You know I used to paint such vibrant dreams  
Now I'm colour blind, colour blind  
When did my heart  
Get so full of never mind, never mind  
Did you know  
That you stole the only thing I needed  
Only black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind  
It's only black and white in my eyes  
I'm colour blind

Having the time of your life  
Ooh see that girl, watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a king  
  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen, feel the beat  
From the tambourine, oh yeah  
  
You can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh see that girl, watch that scene  
Dig in the dancing queen

Leave 'em burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another, anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen, feel the beat  
From the tambourine, oh yeah

On the floors of Tokyo  
Down in London town's a go-go  
With the record selection  
And the mirror's reflection  
I'm a-dancing with myself  
  
Oh, when there's no one else in sight  
In the crowded, lonely night  
Well, I wait so long for my love vibration  
And I'm dancing with myself  
  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove  
And I'm dancing with myself  
  
If I looked all over the world  
And there's every type of girl  
But your empty eyes seem to pass me by  
And leave me dancing with myself  
  
So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think  
If I had a chance, I'd ask one to dance  
And I'd be dancing with myself  
  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Oh, dancing with myself  
Well there's nothing to lose  
And there's nothing to prove

So let's sink another drink  
'Cause it'll give me time to think

Said the night wind to the little lamb,  
Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb,  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite

Happiness hit her like a train on a track  
Coming towards her, stuck still no turning back  
She hid around corners and she hid under beds  
She killed it with kisses and from it she fled  
  
The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
The horses are coming so you better run  
  
Run fast for your mother, run fast for your father  
Run for your children for your sisters, and brothers  
Leave all your love and your loving behind you  
Can't carry it with you if you want to survive  
  
The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
Can you hear the horses?  
'Cause here they come  
  
And I never wanted anything from you  
Except everything you had  
And what was left after that too, oh  
  
Run fast for your mother, and fast for your father  
Run for your children, for your sisters and your brothers  
Leave all your love and your loving behind  
Can't carry it with you if you want to survive  
  
The dog days are over  
The dog days are done  
Can you hear the horses?  
'Cause here they come  
  
(The dog days are over  
The dog days are gone)  
Here they come

Finn:  
There is freedom within, there is freedom without  
Try to catch the deluge in a paper cup  
There's a battle ahead, many battles are lost  
But you'll never see the end of the road  
While you're traveling with me  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Finn with Tina:  
Don't dream it's over  
  
Finn:  
Hey now, hey now  
  
Finn with Tina:  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us  
We know they won't win  
  
Tina and Blaine:  
Now I'm towing my car, there's a hole in the roof  
My possessions are causing me suspicion but there's no proof  
  
Sam and Brittany:  
In the paper today tales of war and of waste  
But you turn right over to the T.V. page  
  
Blaine with Tina and New Directions:  
Hey now, hey now

Finn:  
Yeah! (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
  
Tina:  
Oh oh whoa! (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah)  
  
Finn:  
Now I'm walking again to the beat of a drum  
  
Finn and Tina:  
And I'm counting the steps to the door of your heart  
  
Tina and Blaine:  
Only shadows ahead barely clearing the roof  
Get to know the feeling of liberation and release  
(New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh! )  
  
Marley:  
Oh, whoa, whoa, yeah yeah yeah!  
  
Finn with New Directions:  
Hey now, hey now

Hey now, hey now  
When the world comes in  
They come, they come  
To build a wall between us (New Directions: Ahhhh ahhh ahh ah! )

No they won't win!

Don't tell me not to live, just sit and putter  
Life's candy and the sun's a ball of butter  
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade  
  
Don't tell me not to fly, I simply got to  
If someone takes a spill, it's me and not you  
Who told you you're allowed to rain on my parade  
  
I'll march my band out, I'll beat my drum  
And if I'm fanned out, your turn at bat, sir  
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir  
I guess I didn't make it  
  
But whether I'm the rose of sheer perfection  
A freckle on the nose of life's complexion  
The cinder or the shiny apple of its eye  
  
I gotta fly once, I gotta try once  
Only can die once, right, sir  
Ooh, life is juicy, juicy and you see  
I gotta have my bite, sir  
  
Get ready for me love, cause I'm a "comer"  
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer  
Don't bring around a cloud to rain on my parade  
  
I'm gonna live and live now  
Get what I want, I know how  
One roll for the whole shebang  
One throw and that bell will go clang  
Eye on the target and wham!  
One shot, one gun shot and bam  
Hey Mister Arnstein, here I am!  
  
I'll march my band out, I'll beat my drum  
And if I'm fanned out, your turn at bat, sir  
At least I didn't fake it, hat, sir  
I guess I didn't make it  
  
Get ready for me love, cause I'm a "comer"  
I simply gotta march, my heart's a drummer  
Nobody, no nobody, is gonna rain on my parade

You and me  
We used to be together  
Everyday together always  
I really feel  
That I'm losing my best friend  
I can't believe  
This could be the end  
It looks as though you're letting go  
And if it's real  
Well I don't want to know  
  
Don't speak  
I know just what you're saying  
So please stop explaining  
Don't tell me cause it hurts  
Don't speak  
I know what you're thinking  
I don't need your reasons  
Don't tell me cause it hurts  
  
Our memories  
Well, they can be inviting  
But some are altogether  
Mighty frightening  
As we die, both you and I  
With my head in my hands  
I sit and cry  
  
Don't speak  
I know just what you're saying  
So please stop explaining  
Don't tell me cause it hurts (no, no, no)  
Don't speak  
I know what you're thinking  
I don't need your reasons  
Don't tell me cause it hurts  
  
It's all ending  
I gotta stop pretending who we are,  
You and me I can see us dying, are we?  
  
Don't speak  
I know just what you're saying  
So please stop explaining  
Don't tell me cause it hurts (no, no, no)  
Don't speak  
I know what you're thinking  
I don't need your reasons  
Don't tell me cause it hurts  
Don't tell me cause it hurts!  
I know what you're saying  
So please stop explaining  
  
Don't speak,  
Don't speak,  
Don't speak,  
Oh I know what you're thinking  
And I don't need your reasons  
I know you're good,  
I know you're good,  
I know you're real good  
Oh, la la la la la la La la la la la la  
Don't, don't, uh-huh hush, hush darlin'  
Hush, hush darlin' hush, hush  
Don't tell me tell me cause it hurts  
Hush, hush darlin' hush, hush darlin'  
Hush, hush don't tell me tell me cause it hurts

Don't stop! Don't stop!  
  
If you wake up and don't want to smile,  
If it takes just a little while,  
Open your eyes and look at the day,  
You'll see things in a different way.  
  
Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,  
It'll be, better than before,  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  
  
Don't stop! Don't stop!  
  
Why not think about times to come,  
And not about the things that you've done,  
If your life was bad to you,  
Just think what tomorrow will do.  
  
Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,  
It'll be, better than before,  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  
  
Don't stop! Don't stop!  
  
All I want is to see you smile,  
If it takes just a little while,  
I know you don't believe that it's true,  
I never meant any harm to you.  
  
Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,  
It'll be, better than before,  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  
  
Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow,  
Don't stop, it'll soon be here,  
It'll be, better than before,  
Yesterday's gone, yesterday's gone.  
  
Don't you look back,  
Don't you look back,  
Don't you look back,  
Don't you look back  
  
Don't stop, thinking about tomorrow!

Just a small town girl  
Livin' in a lonely world  
She took the midnight train goin' anywhere  
  
Just a city boy  
Born and raised in South Detroit  
He took the midnight train goin' anywhere  
  
A singer in a smokey room  
The smell of wine and cheap perfume  
For a smile they can share the night  
It goes on and on and on and on  
  
Strangers waiting  
Up and down the boulevard  
Their shadows searchin' in the night  
  
Streetlight, people  
Livin' just to find emotion  
Hidin' somewhere in the night  
  
Workin' hard to get my fill  
Everybody wants a thrill  
Payin' anythin' to roll the dice  
Just one more time  
  
Some will win, some will lose  
Some are born to sing the blues  
Oh the movie never ends  
It goes on and on and on and on  
  
Strangers waiting  
Up and down the boulevard  
Their shadows searchin' in the night  
  
Streetlight, people  
Livin' just to find emotion  
Hidin' somewhere in the night  
  
Don't stop believin'  
Hold on to that feelin'  
Streetlight, people, oh oh oh  
  
Don't stop believin'  
Hold on to that feelin'  
Streetlight, people, oh oh oh  
  
Don't stop!

Blaine:  
You were working as a waitress in a cocktail bar,  
When I met you...  
I picked you out, I shook you up, and turned you around,  
Turned you into someone new.  
  
Now five years later on, you've got the world at your feet.  
Success has been so easy for you,  
But don't forget it's me who put you where you are now,  
And I can put you back down too.  
  
Don't, don't you want me?  
You know I can't believe it  
When I hear that you won't see me  
  
Don't, don't you want me?  
You know I don't believe it  
When you say that you don't need me  
  
Both:  
It's much too late to find.  
You think you've changed your mind.  
You'd better change it back, or we will both be sorry.  
  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, ohh  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, ohh  
  
Rachel:  
I was working as a waitress in a cocktail bar.  
That much is true,  
But even then I knew I'd find a much better place  
Either with or without you.  
  
The five years we have had have been such good times.  
I still love you,  
But now I think it's time I lived my life on my own.  
I guess it's just what I must do.  
  
Both:  
Don't, don't you want me?  
You know I can't believe it  
When I hear that you won't see me.  
  
Don't, don't you want me?  
You know I don't believe you  
When you say that you don't need me.  
  
It's much too late to find.  
When you think you've changed your mind,  
You'd better change it back or we will both be sorry  
  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, ohh  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, ohh  
  
(Ooh, ooh, ooh)  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, oh  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, oh  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, oh  
Don't you want me, baby?  
Don't you want me, oh  
Don't you want me, baby?

When you're alone and life is making you lonely  
You can always go - downtown  
When you've got worries, all the noise and the hurry  
Seems to help, I know - downtown  
Just listen to the music of the traffic in the city  
Linger on the sidewalk where the neon signs are pretty  
How can you lose?  
  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're  
Downtown - no finer place, for sure  
Downtown - everything's waiting for you  
  
Don't hang around and let your problems surround you  
There are movie shows - downtown  
Maybe you know some little places to go to  
Where they never close - downtown  
Just listen to the rhythm of a gentle bossa nova  
You'll be dancing with him too before the night is over  
Happy again  
  
The lights are much brighter there  
You can forget all your troubles, forget all your cares  
So go downtown, where all the lights are bright  
Downtown - waiting for you tonight  
Downtown - you're gonna be all right now  
  
And you may find somebody kind to help and understand you  
Someone who is just like you and needs a gentle hand to  
Guide them along  
  
So maybe I'll see you there  
We can forget all our troubles, forget all our cares  
So go downtown, things'll be great when you're  
Downtown - don't wait a minute more  
Downtown - everything's waiting for you  
  
Downtown, downtown, downtown, downtown...

Every time that I look in the mirror  
All these lines on my face getting clearer  
The past is gone  
It went by, like dusk to dawn  
Isn't that the way  
Everybody's got their dues in life to pay  
  
Yeah, I know nobody knows  
Where it comes and where it goes  
I know it's everybody's sin  
You got to lose to know how to win  
  
Half my life  
Is in books' written pages  
Lived and learned from fools and  
From sages  
You know it's true  
All the things come back to you  
  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tears  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good lord will take you away, yeah  
  
Yeah, sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away  
  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
Dream until the dream come true  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
Dream until your dream comes true  
Dream on, dream on, dream on  
Dream on, dream on  
Dream on, dream on  
  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laughter, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away  
Sing with me, sing for the year  
Sing for the laugh, sing for the tear  
Sing with me, if it's just for today  
Maybe tomorrow  
The good Lord will take you away

There's only you in my life  
The only thing that's right  
  
My first love,  
You're every breath that I take  
You're every step I make  
  
And I (I-I-I-I-I) I want to share  
All my love with you

And your eyes (your eyes, your eyes)  
  
They tell me how much you care  
Ooh yeah, you will always be  
My endless love  
  
Two hearts,  
Two hearts that beat as one  
Our lives have just begun  
  
Forever (oh)  
I'll hold you close in my arms  
I can't resist your charms  
  
And love (oh, love)  
I'll be a fool  
For you, I'm sure  
You know I don't mind  
Oh, you know I don't mind  
  
'Cause you,

My love  
My love, my love  
My endless love

Welcome to your life  
There's no turning back  
Even while we sleep  
We will find you  
Acting on your best behavior  
Turn your back on mother nature  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
It's my own design  
It's my own remorse  
Help me to decide  
Help me make the most  
Of freedom and of pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
There's a room where the light won't find you  
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down  
When they do I'll be right behind you  
  
So glad we've almost made it  
So sad they had to fade it  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
I can't stand this indecision  
Married with a lack of vision  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
Say that you'll never never never never need it  
One headline why believe it?  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
  
All for freedom and for pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world

Notice me  
Take my hand  
Why are we  
Strangers when  
Our love is strong  
Why carry on without me?  
  
Everytime I try to fly  
I fall without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And everytime I see you in my dreams  
I see your face, it's haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I make believe  
That you are here  
It's the only way  
I see clear  
What have I done  
You seem to move on easy  
  
And everytime I try to fly  
I fall without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And everytime I see you in my dreams  
I see your face, you're haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
I may have made it rain  
Please forgive me  
My weakness caused your pain  
And this song is my sorry  
  
Ohhhh  
  
At night I pray  
That soon your face  
Will fade away  
  
And everytime I try to fly  
I fall without my wings  
I feel so small  
I guess I need you baby  
And everytime I see you in my dreams  
I see your face, you're haunting me  
I guess I need you baby  
  
After all

Highway run, into the midnight sun  
Wheels go round and round  
You're on my mind  
Restless hearts, sleep alone tonight  
Sending all my love along the wire  
  
They say that the road  
Ain't no place to start a family  
Right down the line it's been you and me  
And lovin' a music man ain't always what it's supposed to be  
Oh boy, you stand by me  
I'm forever yours  
Faithfully  
  
Circus life, under the big top world  
We all need the clowns to make us smile  
Oh, through space and time  
Through space and time  
Always another show  
Wonderin' where I am, lost without you  
  
And bein' apart ain't easy on this love affair  
Two strangers learn to fall in love again  
I get the joy of rediscovering you  
Oh girl, you stand by me  
I'm forever yours  
Faithfully  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Faithfully  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Faithfully  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
I'm still yours  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I'm still yours  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
I'm still yours  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
Faithfully

After all that you put me through,  
You think I'd despise you,  
But in the end I wanna thank you,  
'Cause you've made me that much stronger  
  
Well I thought I knew you, thinking that you were true  
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up 'cause I've had enough  
You were there by my side, always down for the ride  
But your joy ride just came down in flames 'cause your greed sold me out in
shame  
  
After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that I hold
resentment for you  
But uh uh, no no, you're wrong  
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know  
Just how capable I am to pull through  
So I wanna say thank you 'cause it  
  
Makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game  
I heard you're going 'round playing the victim now  
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame 'cause you dug your own
grave  
After all of the fights and the lies 'cause you're wanting to haunt me  
But that won't work anymore  
No more, oh it's over  
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture  
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down  
So I wanna say thank you 'cause it  
  
Makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
  
How could this man I thought I knew  
Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to see the truth  
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself  
Through living in denial  
But in the end you'll see  
You won't stop me  
  
I am a fighter and I, (I am a fighter)  
I ain't gonna stop (I ain't gonna stop)  
There is no turning back  
I've had enough  
  
Makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
  
You thought I would forget  
But I, I remembered  
'Cause I remembered  
I remembered  
You thought I would forget  
Oh, I remembered  
Oh, 'cause I remembered  
Yeah I remembered  
  
Makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for making me a fighter

Well, Romeo and Juliet

Do you ever feel like a plastic bag  
Drifting through the wind wanting to start again?  
Do you ever feel, feel so paper thin  
Like a house of cards, one blow from caving in?  
Do you ever feel already buried deep?  
Six feet under screams but no one seems to hear a thing  
Do you know that there's still a chance for you  
'Cause there's a spark in you  
  
You just gotta ignite, the light, and let it shine  
Just own the night like the fourth of July  
  
'Cause baby you're a firework  
Come on, show 'em what you're worth  
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
Baby, you're a firework  
Come on, show 'em what you're worth  
Make 'em go "Oh, oh, oh"  
As you shoot across the sky-y-y  
  
(Boom, boom, boom even brighter)  
Than the moon, moon, moon  
Boom, boom, boom even brighter  
Than the moon, moon, moon

May the good Lord be with you  
Down every road you roam  
And may sunshine and happiness  
Surround you when you're far from home  
And may you grow to be proud, dignified and true  
And do unto others as you'd have done to you  
  
Be courageous and be brave  
And in my heart you'll always stay  
Forever young, forever young  
  
May good fortune be with you  
May your guiding light be strong  
Build a stairway to Heaven  
With a prince or a vagabond  
  
And may you never love in vain  
And in my heart you'll always remain  
Forever young, forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
Forever young,  
  
And when you finally fly away  
I'll be hoping that I served you well  
For all the wisdom of a lifetime  
No one can ever tell  
  
But whatever road you choose  
I'm right behind you, win or lose  
Forever young, forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
Forever young, forever young  
For, forever young, forever young

What have I done? I wish I could run  
Away from this ship going under  
Just trying to help, hurt everyone else  
Now I feel the weight of the world is  
On my shoulders  
  
What can you do when your good isn't good enough?  
When all that you touch tumbles down?  
'Cause my best intentions keep making a mess of things  
I just want to fix it somehow  
But how many times will it take?  
Oh, how many times will it take for me?  
To get it right  
To get it right  
  
Can I start again with my faith shaken?  
'Cause I can't go back and undo this  
I just have to stay and face my mistakes  
But if I get stronger and wiser  
I'll get through this  
  
What can you do when your good isn't good enough?  
When all that you touch tumbles down?  
'Cause my best intentions keep making a mess of things  
I just wanna fix it somehow  
But how many times will it take?  
Oh, how many times will it take for me?  
To get it right  
  
So I throw up my fist  
Throw a punch in the air  
And accept the truth, that sometimes life isn't fair  
Yeah, I'll send out a wish  
Yeah, I'll send up a prayer  
And finally, someone will see  
How much I care  
  
What can you do when your good isn't good enough?  
When all that you touch tumbles down?  
'Cause my best intentions keep making a mess of things  
I just wanna fix it somehow  
But how many times will it take?  
Oh, how many times will it take?  
To get it right

My father says "What you gonna do with your life?"  
Well lady dear, you're still number one  
Oh girls they wanna have fun

Well not me I wanna be the one in the sun  
Girls they wanna have fun  
Oh girls they they  
That's all they really want  
Those girls they wanna have fun

The day I first met you  
You told me you'd never fall in love  
But now that I get you

I called your cell phone, my love  
But you did not reply  
  
The world is ours if we want it  
We can take it  
  
If you just take my hand  
There's no turning back now (There's no turning back now)

Wanna give your heart a break

Maybe I can ease the ache, the ache  
So let me give your heart a break  
  
Give your heart a break  
Your heart a break  
  
Your heart a break

I wake up every evening

And it never feels out of place.  
And you're still probably working  
At a 9 to 5 pace  
I wonder how bad that tastes  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
  
Now where's your picket fence love?  
And where's that shiny car?  
Did it ever get you far?  
You never seem so tense, love  
I never seen you fall so hard  
Do you know where you are?  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told I'm lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
Hope it gives you hell  
  
Tomorrow you'll be thinking to yourself  
Yeah. Where did it all go wrong?  
But the list goes on and on  
  
And truth be told I miss you  
And truth be told I'm lying  
  
When you see my face  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
Hope it gives you hell, Hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
Now you'll never see  
What you've done to me  
You can take back your memories  
They're no good to me  
And here's all your lies  
You can look me in the eyes  
With the sad, sad look  
That you wear so well  
  
When you see my face  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell  
If you find a man that's worth the damn and treats you well  
(Treats you well)  
Then he's a fool you're just as well hope it gives you hell  
  
When you see my face

(hope it gives you hell)  
When you walk my way  
I hope it gives you hell, I hope it gives you hell

When you hear this song I hope that it will give you hell  
(give you hell)  
You can sing along I hope that he will treat you well

Make you glad you came

Loving you  
Isn't the right thing to do  
How can I ever change things  
That I feel  
If I could  
Maybe I'd give you my world  
How can I  
When you won't take it from me  
  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day  
Another lonely day  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
  
Tell me why  
Everything turned around  
Packing up  
Shacking up is all you wanna do  
If I could  
Baby I'd give you my world  
Open up  
Everything's waiting for you  
  
You can go your own way  
Go your own way  
You can call it  
Another lonely day

If I could give you the world, on a silver platter

If I could find in all this a dozen roses which I would to give you,  
You'd still be miserable.

Help, I need somebody  
Help, not just anybody  
Help, you know, I need someone  
Help  
  
(When)  
When I was younger, so much younger than today (I never needed)  
I never needed anybody's help in any way (now)  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured (and now I find)  
Now I find, I've changed my mind, I've opened up the doors  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you, please, please help me?  
  
(Now)  
And now my life has changed in, oh, so many ways (my independence)  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze (but)  
But every now and then I feel so insecure (I know that I)  
I know that I just need you like I've never done before  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being 'round  
Help me get my feet back on the ground  
Won't you, please, please help me?

Hey Jude, don't make it bad  
Take a sad song and make it better  
Remember to let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
Hey Jude, don't be afraid  
You were made to go out and get her  
The minute you let her under your skin  
Then you begin to make it better  
  
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain  
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders  
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool  
By making his world a little colder

You have found her, now go and get her  
Remember to let her into your heart

So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin  
You're waiting for someone to perform with  
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do  
The movement you need is on your shoulder  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah  
  
Hey Jude, don't make it bad  
Take a sad song and make it better  
Remember to let her under your skin  
Then you'll begin to make it  
Better better better better better better, oh

Why do lock yourself up in these chains?  
No one can change your life except for you  
Don't ever let anyone step all over you  
Just open your heart and your mind  
Is it really fair to feel this way inside?  
  
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them  
Hold you down and make you cry

Things'll go your way  
Hold on for one more day  
  
You could sustain  
Or are you comfortable with the pain?  
You've got no one to blame for your unhappiness  
You got yourself into your own mess  
Lettin' your worries pass you by  
Don't you think it's worth your time  
To change your mind?  
  
Some day somebody's gonna make you want to  
Turn around and say goodbye  
Until then baby are you going to let them  
Hold you down and make you cry

Things'll go your way  
If you hold on for one more day  
Can you hold on for one more day  
Things'll go your way  
Hold on for one more day  
  
I know that there is pain  
But you hold on for one more day and  
Break free the chains

But you hold on for one more day and you  
Break free, break from the chains

Another summer day  
Has come and gone away  
In Paris and Rome  
But I wanna go home  
  
May be surrounded by  
A million people I  
Still feel all alone  
Just wanna go home  
Oh I miss you, you know  
  
And I've been keeping all the letters that I wrote to you  
Each one a line or two  
"I'm fine baby, how are you?"  
Well, I would send them but I know that it's just not enough  
My words were cold and flat  
And you deserve more than that  
  
Another aeroplane  
Another sunny place  
I'm lucky I know  
But I wanna go home  
I've got to go home  
  
Let me go home  
I'm just too far from where you are  
I wanna come home  
  
And I feel just like I'm living someone else's life  
It's like I just stepped outside  
When everything was going right  
And I know just why you could not  
Come along with me  
'Cause this was not your dream  
But you always believed in me  
  
Another winter day has come  
And gone away  
In Eden, Paris, and Rome  
And I wanna go home  
Let me go home  
  
And I'm surrounded by  
A million people I,  
I Still feel alone  
Let me go home  
Oh, I miss you, you know  
  
Let me go home  
I've had my run  
Baby, I'm done  
I gotta go home  
Let me go home  
It'll all be alright  
I'll be home tonight  
I'm coming back home

Guess mine is not the first heart broken,  
My eyes are not the first to cry I'm not the first to know,  
There's just no gettin' over you  
I know I'm just a fool who's willing to sit around  
And wait for you  
But baby can't you see, there's nothin' else  
For me to do I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
But now there's nowhere to hide,  
Since you pushed my love aside I'm out of my head,  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you,  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
My head is saying "fool, forget him",  
My heart is saying "don't let go"  
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
But now there's nowhere to hide,  
Since you pushed my love aside I'm not in my head,  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you,  
Hopelessly devoted to you

Well she was just seventeen  
You know what I mean  
And the way she looked  
Was way beyond compare  
So how could I dance with another,  
Oh, when I saw her standing there  
  
Well she looked at me  
And I, I could see  
That before too long  
I'd fall in love with her  
She wouldn't dance with another  
Oh, when I saw her standing there  
  
Well my heart went boom  
When I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine  
  
Oh we danced through the night  
And we held each other tight  
And before too long  
I fell in love with her  
Now I'll never dance with another  
Oh, when I saw her standing there  
  
Well my heart went boom  
When I crossed that room  
And I held her hand in mine

And before too long  
I fell in love with her  
Now I'll never dance with another  
Oh, when I saw her standing there

[Verse:]  
Looking back on when I  
Was a little nappy headed boy  
Then my only worry  
Was for Christmas what would be my toy  
Even though we sometimes  
Would not get a thing  
We were happy with the  
Joy the day would bring  
  
[Verse:]  
Sneaking out the back door  
To hang out with those hoodlum friends of mine  
Greeted at the back door  
Boy I thought I told you not to go outside  
  
[Verse:]  
Tryin' your best to bring the  
Water to your eyes  
Thinkin' it might stop her  
From woopin' your behind  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish those days could come back once more  
Why did those days ev-er have to go?  
I wish those days could come back once more  
Why did those days ev-er have to go?  
Cause I love them so  
  
[Verse:]  
Brother says he's tellin'  
'Bout you playin' doctor with that girl  
Just don't tell and I'll give you  
Anything you want in this whole wide world  
Mama gives you money for Sunday school  
You trade yours for candy after church is through  
  
[Verse:]  
Smokin' cigarettes and writing something nasty on the wall (you nasty boy)  
Teacher sends you to the principal's office down the hall  
You grow up and learn that kinda thing ain't right  
But while you were doing it-it sure felt outta sight  
  
[Chorus:]  
I wish those days could come back once more  
Why did those days ev-er have to go?  
I wish those days could come back once more  
Why did those days ev-er have to go?

When I look into your eyes  
It's like watching the night sky  
Or a beautiful sunrise  
But there's so much they hold  
And just like them old stars  
I see that you've come so far  
To be right where you are  
How old is your soul?  
  
Well I won't give up on us  
Even if the skies get rough  
I'm giving you all my love  
I'm still looking up  
  
And when you're needing your space  
To do some navigating  
I'll be here patiently waiting  
To see what you find  
  
'Cause even the stars they burn  
Some even fall to the earth  
We've got a lot to learn  
God knows we're worth it  
No, I won't give up  
  
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily  
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make  
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use  
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake  
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend  
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn  
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in  
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not  
And who I am  
  
I won't give up on us  
Even if the skies get rough  
I'm giving you all my love  
I'm still looking up  
I'm still looking up  
  
I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)  
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)  
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)  
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)  
  
I won't give up on us  
Even if the skies get rough  
I'm giving you all my love  
I'm still looking up

I'm dreaming tonight of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do  
And although I know I  
Its a long road back I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams

Oh, why you look so sad?  
Tears are in your eyes  
Come on and come to me now  
Don't be ashamed to cry  
Let me see you through  
'Cause I've seen the dark side too  
  
When the night falls on you  
You don't know what to do  
Nothing you confess  
Could make me love you less  
  
I'll stand by you  
I'll stand by you  
Won't let nobody hurt you  
I'll stand by you  
  
So, if you're mad, get mad!  
Don't hold it all inside  
Come on and talk to me now  
Hey, what you got to hide?  
I get angry too  
But I'm a lot like you  
  
When you're standing at the crossroads  
Don't know which path to choose  
Let me come along  
'Cause even if you're wrong  
  
I'll stand by you  
I'll stand by you  
Won't let nobody hurt you  
I'll stand by you  
Take me in into your darkest hour  
And I'll never desert you  
I'll stand by you  
  
And when, when the night falls on you baby  
You're feeling all alone  
You won't be on your own  
  
I'll stand by you  
I'll stand by you  
Won't let nobody hurt you  
I'll stand by you  
Take me in into your darkest hour  
And I'll never desert you  
  
I'll stand by you  
I'll stand by you  
Won't let nobody hurt you  
I'll stand by you  
  
And I'll never desert you  
I'll stand by you  
I'll stand by you  
Won't let nobody hurt you  
I'll stand by you

I took my love and I took it down  
I climbed a mountain and I turned around  
And I saw my reflection in the snow-covered hills  
Well, the landslide brought me down  
  
Oh, mirror in the sky, what is love  
Can the child within my heart rise above  
Can I sail through the changing ocean tides  
Can I handle the seasons of my life  
  
Uh uh, uh uh, uh uh, oh  
  
Well, I've been afraid of changin'  
'Cause I've built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
And I'm getting older too  
Well  
  
Well, I've been afraid of changin'  
'Cause I've built my life around you  
But time makes you bolder  
Children get older  
And I'm getting older too  
Well, I'm getting older too  
  
So take this love and take it down  
Yeah, and if you climb a mountain and you turn around  
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills  
Well, the landslide brought it down  
  
And if you see my reflection in the snow-covered hills  
Well maybe, well maybe, well maybe  
A landslide will bring you down
