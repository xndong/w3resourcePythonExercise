Strands of light on our bedroom floor  
Change the night through an open door  
I'm awake but this is not my home  
For the first time I'm not alone  
Reaching out I touch another's skin  
Breathing out as he's breathing in  
Deep inside I feel my soul aflame  
Can my life ever be the same  
I should have told him  
That I'd do anything if I could hold him  
For just another day, for just another day  
His love is something I will not forget  
When I am far away, when I am far away  
I feel the rainfall of another planet  
Another planet  
Close together in the afterglow  
I remember how his loving flowed  
Turned the key into another world  
Made a woman of a simple girl  
Daylight comes as we both know it must  
Soon my fantasy will turn to dust  
But I would give him anything he asked  
If my first love could be my last  
I should have told him  
That I'd do anything if I could hold him  
For just another day, for just another day  
His love is something I will not regret  
When I am far away, when I am far away  
I feel the rainfall of another planet  
Another planet  

When the twilight hour is sparkling  
And the city's all aglow  
Come with me my darling  
To the place we love to go  
When the frost's upon the window  
There's a tingle in your toes  
To the fields of virgin white  
For angels in the snow  
Lying on the frozen ground  
Arms go up and legs go down  
How it looks so perfect I don't know  
With the snowflakes all around  
It feels like heaven's reaching down  
To tell us here on earth we're not alone  
As the rooftops glisten  
And your cheeks turn to rose  
We will lie in wonder making angels in the snow  
With the snowflakes all around  
It feels like heaven's reaching down  
Telling us that we are not alone  
The silver moon is shining  
On the winter world below  
How she'll smile to see us  
Waving our hellos  
And as each season passes  
I will watch as your wings grow  
I'll always think of you this way  
My angel in the snow

Away in a manger, no cry for a bed  
The little load jesus laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the bright sky, look down where he lay  
The little load jesus, asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing, the baby awakes  
But little load jesaus, no crying he makes  
I love thee load jesus, look down from the sky  
And stay by my side until morning is nigh  
  
Be near me, load jesus, I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever, and love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children in thy tender care  
And take us to heaven, to live with thee there  
  
And takes us to heaven, to live with thee there

Every day the pain dies a little  
I'm not at the end but I'm way past the middle  
I know when I'm all healed up  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
Good as new or maybe better  
So glad to know that tears aren't forever  
Tears dry and soon enough  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
Doesn't mean that all my hurt is through  
But more and more I think of me  
And less and less of you  
Oh, you're hard to forget but I'm gonna do it  
Thought I would die but I'm livin' right through it  
I won't give up so don't call my bluff  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
No, it doesn't mean that all the hurt is through  
But more and more I think of me  
And less and less of you  
Every day the pain dies a little  
I'm not at the end but I'm way past the middle  
I know when I'm all healed up  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
I know when I'm all healed up  
I'll be back with a heart and ready to love  
Ooh, ready to love

I asked my love to take a walk  
To take a walk, just a little walk  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others' arms entwine  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
  
I held a knife against his breast  
As into my arms he pressed  
He cried "my love, don't you murder me  
I'm not prepared for eternity"  
  
I wandered home 'tween twelve and one  
I cried, "My God, what have I done?"  
I've killed the only man I love  
He would not take me for his bride  
  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others' arms entwine  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio

(Harrison)  
Why are you still crying  
Your pain is now through  
Please forget those teardrops  
Let me take them from you  
The love you are blessed with  
This world's waiting for  
So let out your heart, please, please  
From behind that locked door  
It's time we start smiling  
What else should we do  
With only this short time  
I know to be here with you  
And the tales you have taught me  
From the things that you saw  
Makes me want out your heart, please, please  
From behind that locked door  
And wherever my love goes  
If I'm rich or I'm poor  
Please let out my heart, please, please  
From behind that locked door  
From behind that locked door  
  

In the twilight glow I see you  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
When we kissed goodbye and parted  
I knew we'd never meet again  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
  
Someday, when we meet up yonder  
We'll stroll hand in hand again  
In a land that knows no parting  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Love is like a dying ember  
And only memories remain  
  
And through the ages I remember  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain  
Blue eyes cryin' in the rain

Harsh words are spoken  
Promises are broken  
Old wounds are opened  
And love walks out that door  
Too proud to make up  
You're ready to break up  
Too late you wake up  
And love walks out that door  
  
Baby oh sweet baby  
I didn't mean a word that I said  
(Well now) you know that I love you  
Can't we talk it over in bed  
I never meant to hurt you  
Must have been out of my head  
Tell me that you still want me  
Can't we talk it over in bed  
(talk talk talk it over)  
  
Harsh words are spoken  
Promises are broken  
Old wounds are opened  
And love walks out that door  
Too proud to make up  
You're ready to break up  
Too late you wake up  
And love walks out that door  
  
Come on a little closer  
Can't we just forgive and forget  
Everything seems to work out  
I never meant to hurt you  
I must have been out of my head  
Tell me that you still want me  
Can't we talk it over in bed  
  
Don't let it no don't let it slip away  
Oh no baby ooh  

If my life gets like a jigsaw  
With the pieces out of place  
Come on over  
Put a smile back on my face  
  
And if all my bad days came at once  
You would know just what to do  
Come on over  
Baby, you would see me through  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Bring your love around  
You can dry away my tears  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Lay your body down  
You know I will be here  
So bring your love around  
  
When I cannot see in front of me  
And I know my darkest day  
Come on over  
You can take it all away  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Bring your love around  
You can wipe away my tears  
  
And if you think I need you  
Come on over  
Lay your body down  
You know I will be here  
So bring your love around  
  
If you think  
If you think I need you  
Come on over

I've wandered far away from God  
Now I'm coming home  
The paths of sin too long I've trod  
Lord, I'm coming home  
  
I've wasted many precious years  
Now I'm coming home  
I repent with bitter tears  
Lord, I'm coming home  
  
Coming home  
Yeah, I'm coming home  
Nevermore to roam  
Open wide thine arms of love  
Lord, I'm coming home  
  
Coming home  
Yeah, I'm coming home  
Nevermore to roam  
Open wide thine arms of love  
Lord I'm coming home  
  
Coming home  
Yeah, I'm coming home  
Nevermore to roam  
Open wide thine arms of love,  
Lord I'm coming home.

Love you were kind and much older  
Foolish but wiser than me  
Am I becoming an anchor  
Holding you back from the sea  
  
Restlessly you stand there, crying silently  
It must be so hard being easy on me  
  
Compassionate man, so gentle  
Trying hard to shelter me  
Compassionate man, so kind  
But the bottom line will be what it will be  
You're leaving me, leaving me  
  
Love, my whole life was a desert  
Then gently your love fell like rain  
We lived for awhile in a garden  
But now I'm a desert again  
  
Come right out and say it  
Tell me honestly  
It must be so hard being easy on me  
  
Compassionate man, so gentle  
Trying hard to shelter me  
Compassionate man, so kind  
But the bottom line will be what it will be  
  
You're leaving me, leaving me  
You're leaving me  
You're leaving me  
You're leaving me

I was born in the country, I was raised with the sun  
The flowers were my pillow when the day's work was done  
Down in the valley shone the bright neon signs  
The call of the city life kept going through my mind  
Oh yeah, the days of my childhood would soon be left behind  
  
It was a Saturday morning when the snow lay on the ground  
Pa said the time had come when I could move to town  
So I kissed goodbye to mama, held on tight to papa's hand  
I saw a tear in mama's eye but I did not understand  
'Cause I was just a country girl being brought up on the land  
  
Goodbye mama, let me see your smile  
Wipe away that teardrop from your eye  
I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
I got to go, but I hate to say goodbye  
So long, papa, I'll be seeing you  
But I'll be coming home again someday  
No, I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
A country girl, you know I'll always stay  
  
I was born in the country, I was raised with the sun  
The flowers were my pillow when the day's work was done  
Down in the valley shone the bright neon signs  
Yet I know where I belong, I got my peace of mind  
Oh yeah, I was born a country girl and that just suits me fine  
  
Goodbye mama, let me see your smile  
Wipe away that teardrop from your eye  
I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
I got to go, but I hate to say goodbye  
So long, papa, I'll be seeing you  
But I'll be coming home again someday  
No, I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
I'll come back to you, believe me  
I won't forget that I'm a country girl  
A country girl, you know I'll always stay

Crying, crying never did nobody no good no how  
That's why I don't cry  
That's why I don't cry  
Laughing, laughing sometimes does somebody some good somehow  
That's why I--I'm laughing now  
That's why I--I'm laughing now  
Loving, loving never did me no good no how--no how  
That's why I can't love you now  
That's why I can't love you now  
Lying, lying never did nobody no good no how--no how  
So why am I lying now?  
So why am I lying now?  
So why am I lying now?

I've been tryin' to tell you  
I've been puttin' it off, puttin' it off, can't wait any longer  
You've been good to me and that only makes it harder to say what I gotta say  
  
You gotta know, I didn't plan it, it was the last thing on my mind  
How can you love two people at the same time? Ooh ooh  
Now I don't wanna lose you, but I can't give him up  
  
I know it's unconventional, radical but practical  
Why can't the three of us live together?  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
(So) tell me, why can't the three of us live together?  
  
If I could go back and undo it  
If I had a time machine, I'd make it unhappen like a bad dream  
Honey you gotta know, I didn't plan it, it was the last thing on my mind  
How can you love two people at the same time? Ooh ooh  
Now I don't wanna lose you, but I can't give him up  
  
I know it's unconventional, radical but practical  
Why can't the three of us live together?  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
(So) tell me, why can't the three of us live together?  
  
You're not takin' this too well, it's out of the question, I can tell  
It's not gonna work, is it  
  
Oh, I know it's unconventional, it's radical but practical  
I don't wanna lose you, no, but I'm not gonna give him up, no  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
Tell me, why can't the three of us live together?  
  
I know it's unconventional, radical but practical  
Why can't the three of us live together?  
It's a culture shock, but it's the only hope we've got  
(So) tell me, why can't the three of us live together?  

I'm gonna go out tonight  
Gonna feel alright  
If it tears me right in two  
'Cause I just can't stay feeling this way  
With a heart that's full of you  
I'm gonna go right down  
To a part of town  
Where I've never been before  
And in some small place  
Find a brand new face  
And step out on the floor  
  
And I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
  
Well you put some distance 'round you  
I know I meant to see  
There's a space inside for someone  
But I know it isn't me  
So among the boys who are searching  
And the girls who hope they're found  
If you look for me, I'm the one you'll see  
Who's dancing 'round and 'round  
  
And I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
  
Come on music, wash my tears away  
Come on darkness, cover up the day  
  
Dancing 'round and 'round  
And I'll be satisfied if I can just hold my ground  
And if he helps me to keep your memory down  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round  
I'll be dancing 'round and 'round

I am my own believer  
In my heart the reason  
I will follow the light from within  
  
I'm not afraid of weakness  
I'm gonna taste the sweetness  
Of the power not to give in  
  
Oh I will see it through  
I believe this is the moment of truth  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
I have the strength to set my spirit free  
Dare to dream  
  
I will go the distance  
Embrace resistance  
And I will lay my soul on the line  
  
And when the way is over  
And our hunger has spoken  
If I'm with my own I will shine  
  
Oh I will see it through  
I believe this is my moment of truth  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
Find the strength to set my spirit free  
Dare to dream  
  
And my heart will shine like the sun  
A million voices together as one  
I believe, I believe  
I believe, I believe  
  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
Find the strength to set my spirit free  
  
Dare to dream, dare to fly  
Dare to breathe the air, the chosen one to touch the sky  
Dare to reach, dare to rise  
Find the strength to set my spirit free  
Find the strength to do what I believe  
Dare to dream, dare to dream

Some people search a lifetime  
For a love to stand the test of time  
But you don't have to worry  
You've got someone  
Who will always be right by your side  
  
Oh  
I've got a love  
Got a love that won't end  
Here in my heart, baby  
I've got a love  
  
[Chorus:]  
So deep, deeper than a river  
So high, higher than any mountain  
So strong, strong enough to last for all time  
This love is running  
So deep, deeper than a river  
It goes on and on  
This love is, this love is, this love is deeper than a river, yeah  
  
Oh yeah  
Just like a tree that stands tall  
Darling I'll stand by you through it all  
There's nothing gonna stop me from loving you  
I will always be right by your side  
  
You've got a love, got a love for all time  
Here in my arms baby  
I've got a love, got a love than won't die  
Here in my heart baby  
I've got a love  
  
[Chorus]  
So deep, deeper than a river  
So high, higher than any mountain  
So strong, strong enough to last for all time  
This love is running  
So deep, deeper than a river  
It goes on and on  
This love is, this love is, this love is deeper than a river, yeah  
  
Like a river needs the sea, I need you with me  
Every minute of my life, oh yeah  
And like the sunlight needs the sky  
I need you by my side  
This love of mine  
Is so deep, baby, is so deep baby, oh, so deep baby  
Oh I've got a love  
So deep, deeper than a river  
It goes on and on and on and on, yeah  
(This love is) you know (this love is) this love is deeper than a river

I can't imagine why you say the things you do  
Maybe in time I'll understand  
What is the reason for the emptiness you feel  
When I'm trying everything I can  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
Can you hear me?  
Am I really coming through?  
Why do your eyes seem to dance away?  
I know what's right for you, haven't I always?  
I need you more than I can say  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
My love is running deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
It's a fire burning bright  
And it's always been this way  
  
And I'll never ever change  
In my life time, I'll stay the same  
Yes I'll never, I'll never change  
I'll love you, I'll stay the same  
  
My love is running  
[Deeper than the night  
Stronger than the north wind blowing  
Fire burning bright  
And it keeps on growing  
Keeps on growing]  

(Olivia Newton-John)  
Do you feel the way I do  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
I need to know that it's true  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
Do you love me the way that I love you  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
I need to know that it's true  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
The world is a wonderful place  
It spins around and spins around  
And spins around in space  
The world has a magic about it  
The stars above are like my love  
You never need to doubt it  
Oh are we real or is this a dream  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
Is it all that it seems  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
The world is a wonderful place  
It spins around and spins around  
And spins around in space  
The world has a magic about it  
And though I try there's so much I  
Will never know about it  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
Tell me now oh tell me now  
I need to know that it's true  
Oh do you feel the way I do  
I need to know  
I need to know  
Do you feel the same way  
Do you feel the same way that I do  
Do you feel like I do  
I need to know  
I need to know  
Do you feel like I do  
  
  

I'm a taxi driver on an all-nighter  
Don't want to fall asleep at the wheel  
Play me some feel  
4 AM business is slow  
I listen to my radio  
If no one flags me down, I turn up the sound  
Moving to the beat  
I cruise the empty streets  
Changing the gears  
Filling up my ears  
Help me stay awake  
Don't take a commercial break  
I need another fare  
So stay on the air  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Won't you play me some driving music  
I'm a daydreamer  
My speedometer says  
I'd better take it slow  
Or my speaker's gonna blow up  
Help me stay awake  
Don't take a commercial break  
I need another fare  
So stay on the air  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Please won't you play me my request  
I want to hear it one more time  
Just for luck  
Spin it again 'fore the sun comes up  
Seems like I'm always changing dials  
Station to station, mile after mile  
Won't you play me some driving music  
Won't you play me some driving music

There's no need for you to tell me  
I can see the way you feel  
I just know without you saying  
What is a lie and what's real  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
Something's going on, and I know it  
You can't keep it from me  
Your smile cannot hide what you feel inside  
And I don't like what I see  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories  
If you want to leave me, leave me  
No good living a lie  
You can pretend that we're not gonna end  
But your eyes are saying goodbye  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye  
You're always telling stories  
You're always telling me lies  
You're always telling stories  
Tell me, I got a right to know  
Pour your little heart out to me, baby  
You know, you know I don't want to let go  
Every face tells a story  
It's hard to hide a lie  
Every face tells a story  
And yours is saying goodbye

You won't regret falling, the bruises you get falling, will all fade away  
Don't analyse falling, don't try being wise, falling  
Forget all your plans, they're out of your hands  
You're falling, falling, falling  
  
Blindly you go falling, the last one to know you're falling, you suddenly see  
There's no way to fight falling, no rescue in sight, you're falling  
You let love inside and hope she'll abide, you're falling, falling, falling  
  
The world that you face is some other planet in space  
You taste something new every moment  
It thrills you, fills you, you're falling  
  
I have to defend falling, 'cause if you should end falling  
I hope you'll be free to spend time with me  
Falling, falling, falling, just falling, falling, falling  
Falling, falling, falling  

(Glen Sharrock)  
It took a long time  
But now I'm gonna be laughing  
A very long time  
When all I could feel was sad  
A very long time  
But now it's gonna be worth it  
Cause I just found a friend to make me glad  
I'm feeling food, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
I'm gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good, feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I hope it doesn't sound like I'm blowing my own trumpet  
Cause all I wanna do is join up with the band  
When you feel good  
You gotta come right out and say it  
I've been so long at sea and I've just seen land  
I'm feeling food, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
I feel a cut above the rest  
I'm gonna put it to the test  
Feeling good, feeling better  
Feeling best  
Feeling good, feeling better  
I'm feeling best  
  

I don't want to cry  
I don't want to say goodbye  
But I will if you won't fight for our love  
It takes more than sayin' I love you  
We need more than words to get us through  
I need to feel that you will fight for our love  
We have a history, a passionate story  
But lately, we're more strangers than friends  
All through the ages  
Love really worth savin' has been battered and scarred  
But it strengthened the heart and that's who you win the end  
I just want to hold you close to me  
How I miss the way we used to be  
Don't let it die, let's you and I fight for our love  
Oh, all through the ages  
Love really worth savin' has been battered and scarred  
But it strengthened the heart and that's who you win the end  
I just want to hold you close to me  
How I miss the way we used to be  
Don't let it die, let's you and I fight for our love  
Don't let it die, let's you and I fight for our love

Fool, whatever you do you remind me  
Fool, wherever you go you won't find me  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
Fool, wherever you go you're a loser  
Such a fool! I want you to know you're a loser  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
I'm really down on love, so save on your smile  
Fool, I won't be needin' any, not for a while  
Fool, fool  
I'm sure I should pass a law laying down  
Declare, you will never wear your face in a frown  
Obey, or be on your way!  
Get on the first stage out of this town  
There's me and my deputy to shake you down  
If you don't grin, we will take you in  
So spread some sunshine around  
Obey, or be on your way!  
Get on the first stage out of this town  
  

(Olivia Newton-John)  
I am your mother--born of the sun  
I gave you shelter--what have you done?  
Your heart's in turmoil--my world's in pain  
I need to turn you back home again  
I am a woman--I am the rain  
And like your father--I feel the betrayed  
What you are doing--can be undone  
You know the answers--tell everyone  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fate's in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
I am the forest--now I'm a tree  
The air is dirty--I cannot breathe  
My streams run empty--my tears run dry  
My children call me--don't let us die  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fate's in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
I love my children and I've been your home  
But I'll survive this--if I'm alone  
I'm survivor--but you will be gone  
Let's start a new world--from this day on  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
Whose fate's in jeopardy  
Respect me  
Respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
Oh respect me  
Oh respect me  
I need you to protect me  
For it is you not me  
That's the part you fail to see  
  
  

Well my temperature is rising and my feet left the floor  
Crazy people knockin' cause they're wantin' some more  
Let me in baby, I don't know what you've got

And I'm so glad we made it  
So glad we made it  
Oh won't you  
Gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'

Well I feel so good, everything is getting hot  
You'd better take it easy, cause this place is on fire  
It's been a hard day, and I ain't feeling too good  
I'd better relax like everybody should  
  
And I'm so glad we made it  
So glad we made it  
Oh won't you  
Gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin', gimme some lovin'  
Every day  
Gimme, gimme some lovin'  
Oh baby, gimme some lovin'  
Oh gimme some lovin'

Oh baby won't you gimme some lovin'

Why this car is automatic  
It's systematic

Why it's greased lightnin'!  
(grease lightnin'!)  
  
We'll get some overhead lifters, and four-barrel quads, oh yeah  
(Keep talkin', oh keep talkin')  
Fuel injection cut off, and chrome plated rods, oh yeah

With a four-speed on the floor, they'll be waitin' at the door  
You know that ain't no shit  
We'll be gettin' lots of tit in grease lightnin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Go, grease lightnin', you're burnin' up the quarter mile

You are supreme, the chicks'll cream for grease lightnin'  
  
We'll get some purple French tail lights and thirty-inch fins, oh yeah  
A palomino dashboard and duel muffler twins, oh yeah  
With new pistons, plugs, and shocks, I can get off my rocks  
You know that I ain't braggin',  
She's a real pussy wagon - grease lightnin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]

And there'll be hands, hands across the sea  
Touching everybody, joining you and me  
If we could build a new horizon  
I'd like to see some changes made  
When nations hear the voice of reason  
And all the world live unafraid  
And there'll be hands, hands across the sea  
People joined as one, innocent and free  
And we'll have love, love and sympathy  
Touching everybody, joining you and me  
If we could share that new tomorrow  
You with your troubles, me with mine  
Then we could face the world together  
With open heart and easy mind  
And there'll be hands, hands across the sea  
People joined as one, innocent and free  
And we'll have love, love and sympathy  
Touching everybody, joining you and me  
Hands across the sea  
Hands across the sea

There was a time when I was in a hurry as you are  
I was like you  
There was a day when I just had to tell my point of view  
I was like you  
Now I don't mean to make you frown  
No, I just want you to slow down  
  
Have you never been mellow?  
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?  
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?  
Have you never let someone else be strong?  
  
Running around as you do with your head up in the clouds  
I was like you  
Never had time to lay back, kick your shoes off, close your eyes  
I was like you  
Now you're not hard to understand  
You need someone to hold your hand  
  
Have you never been mellow?  
Have you never tried to find a comfort from inside you?  
Have you never been happy just to hear your song?  
Have you never let someone else be strong?

My mouth is dry  
My legs are weak  
I'm thinkin' this 'cause I can't speak  
I'm lookin at you lookin' at me  
You must think that I'm just crazy  
  
If you only knew what you're putting me through!  
There's that heart attack!  
You're givin' me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're givin' me a heart attack!  
I must have died and gone to heaven  
What a way to go!  
  
I can't catch my breath  
It must be a dream  
But you're the cutest thing I've ever seen  
I'm way past the point of recovery  
You're gonna be the death of me  
  
If you only knew what you're putting me through!  
There's that heart attack!  
You're givin' me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're givin' me a heart attack!  
I must have died and gone to heaven  
What a way to go!  
A heart attack, you're giving me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're giving me a heart attack!  
A heart attack, you're giving me a heart attack!  

And there's no need to tell me I'm just wasting time  
But if you tell me break it slowly  
I'm in deep water and I'm hanging on a line  
And you're the only one can save me  
But if you gotta go  
I think you better know  
  
Oh, heartbreaker, if you want to leave  
I won't make you stay  
If you want to go, better go away  
Oh, you loser, offered you a love  
You refused her  
What you gonna do when she goes away  
  
I know the memories melt their pictures in my mind  
Too bad to see they could be fading  
But I'll come home to you  
If someday you should find  
You want me back then I'll be waiting  
But if you gotta go  
I think you better know  
  
Oh, heartbreaker, if you want to leave  
I won't make you stay  
If you want to go, better go away  
Oh, you loser, offered you a love  
You refused her  
What you gonna do when she goes away  
  
Um, heartbreaker, if you want to leave  
I won't make you stay  
If you want to go, better go away  
Oh, you loser, offered you a love  
And you refused her  
What you gonna do when she goes away  
Oh, what you gonna do when she goes away

Take the ribbon from my hair  
Shake it loose and let it fall  
Lay it soft against your skin  
Like the shadows on the wall  
  
Come and lay down by my side  
Till the early morning light  
All I'm takin' is your time  
Help me make it through the night  
  
I don't care who's right or wrong  
I don't try to understand  
Let the devil take tomorrow  
Lord, tonight I need a friend  
  
Yesterday is dead and gone  
And tomorrow's out of sight  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
  
And it's sad to be alone  
Help me make it through the night  
I don't wanna be alone  
Help me make it through the night

I've seen so many smiling faces today  
But just what lies behind them I can't see  
I've lived my life in many places, you see  
Now I don't know just where I want to be  
  
'Cause home ain't home anymore, no more  
My heart ain't here anymore, no more  
  
The years have opened up a canyon it seems  
A canyon deep and wide that I can't cross  
And though my nomad days have opened my eyes  
I've learned that every game must bear a loss  
  
'Cause home ain't home anymore, no more  
My heart ain't here anymore, no more  
  
Don't be afraid to tell me  
That things are not the same  
I'm older now and wiser  
I know how things can change  
  
'Cause home ain't home anymore, no more  
My heart ain't here anymore, no more

Guess mine is not the first heart broken  
My eyes are not the first to cry  
I'm not the first to know there's  
Just no getting over you  
  
You know I'm just a fool who's willing  
To sit around and wait for you  
But baby can't you see there's nothing else for me to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no way to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
  
My head is saying fool forget him  
My heart is saying don't let go  
Hold on to the end, that's what I intend to do  
I'm hopelessly devoted to you  
  
But now there's no way to hide  
Since you pushed my love aside  
I'm outta my head hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you  
Hopelessly devoted to you

Just one innocent smile that I could have missed  
That's all it took to start all this  
One word so softly spoken when I needed it most  
Why you, why right now, who knows?  
  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
  
Last kiss until tomorrow out on the front porch swing  
Till then nothin' means anything  
  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
  
I can't let go when I'm holdin' you tight  
All I dream of is that day when we don't have to say goodnight  
  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
And I don't know why this is happenin'  
Why it feels so right  
But I do know I don't want to say goodnight  
  
Just one innocent smile that I could have missed  
That's all it took to start all this  
Oh no, I don't want to say goodnight  
Oh no, I don't want to say goodnight  
Oh, I don't want to say goodnight  
Oh no, just want to hold you tight

Maybe I hang around here  
A little more than I should  
We both know I got somewhere else to go  
But I got something to tell you  
That I never thought I would  
But I believe you really ought to know  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
  
You don't have to answer  
I see it in your eyes  
Maybe it was better left unsaid  
This is pure and simple  
And you should realize  
That it's coming from my heart and not my head  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
  
I'm not trying to make you feel uncomfortable  
I'm not trying to make you anything at all  
But this feeling doesn't come along everyday  
And you shouldn't blow the chance  
When you've got the chance to say  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
  
If we both were born  
In another place and time  
This moment might be ending in a kiss  
But there you are with yours  
And here I am with mine  
So, I guess we'll just be leaving it at this  
  
I love you  
I honestly love you  
I honestly love you

(Nichtern)  
I never did sing you a love song  
I only sang phrases in time  
I never did write you a sonnet  
I just laid my WORDS down in rhymes  
Up and down the river, so many boats to ride  
Yet precious few deliver the goods that we need to survive  
I never spoke falsely or crossly  
I never put tears in your eyes  
And you never shattered my lonely heart  
You never deceived me with lies  
And yet somehow I seem to recall I STIRRED in my sleep for a while  
Dreaming of a river man exchanging my life for a smile  
  

I asked you to come inside my heart  
And there you were  
I asked for a pure and gentle start  
And there you were  
I asked if this love could ever be  
The way that I've dreamt of it you see  
I never knew love  
I asked you to open up my eyes  
And there you were  
I asked for the keys to paradise  
And there you were  
They say only ask and you'll receive  
I never knew that applied to me  
I never knew love  
Life is good life is sweet  
It's the way that we perceive  
Cynics say we can dream  
Change your mind heal the world  
It's easy just believe  
I asked for a change in all my life  
And there you were  
You're everything I had hoped to find  
Yes, there you were  
I hope and I pray that you will find  
A peace and a joy as great as mine  
All about love  
I hope you find love  

Alone, so alone, that I could cry  
I want to be wanted  
Alone, watching lovers passing by  
I want to be wanted  
  
When I'm kissed, I want his lips to really kiss me  
When we're apart, I want his heart to really miss me  
I want to know he loves me so  
His eyes are misty  
That's the way I want to be loved  
  
Alone, just my lonely heart knows how  
I want to be wanted  
Right now, not tomorrow, but right now  
I want to be wanted  
  
I want someone to share my laughter and my tears with  
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with  
When is this someone somewhere meant for me  
  
I want to want someone to share my laughter and my tears with  
Someone I know I'd love to spend a million years with  
When is this someone somewhere meant for me  
Oh, meant for me, ooh, meant for me

How can I say, how much you've done for me  
How much I have just knowing I had you  
You touched my world and I'll never be the same  
You touched my heart and now everything has changed  
You are the one in this life I'll remember  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
I'll always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
There'll always be a part of you with me  
I hope there'll be a part of me with you  
Just call my name and I'll hear you on the wind  
Just close your eyes and I'll find you once again  
Just know that I'm on your side and remember  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
I'll always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
And when the wind touches you  
It will touch me too  
And the same star you see  
Will be the one that shines on me  
I'll be here when you need me  
I'll be here anytime  
Baby, I'm your side so remember  
I will be right here  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
Wherever you are  
My heart is with you  
No matter how far  
I'll always be near  
Whenever you need me  
I will be right here  
I will be right here  
I will be right here  

(Cagan)  
I can count the teardrops hidden from your eyes  
I can hear the sadness that your smile belies  
Thought I heard a whisper  
Did it come from you  
If you say you're ready  
I am ready too  
I will touch you deep inside where love is  
I will touch your sorrow and make it go away  
I can hear the questions running through your mind  
I can feel the answers very close behind  
When your heart is ready  
You will understand  
When you're tired of crying  
You will take my hand  
I will touch you deep inside where love is  
I will touch your sorrow and make it go away  
  

If a picture paints a thousand words  
Then why can't I paint you  
The words will never show  
The you I've come to know  
  
If a face could launch a thousand ships  
Then where am I to go  
There's no one home but you  
You're all that's left me too  
  
And when my love for life is running dry  
You'll come and pour yourself on me  
  
If a girl could be two places at one time  
I'd be with you  
Tomorrow and today, beside you all the way  
If the world should stop revolving  
  
Spinning slowly down to die  
I'd spend the end with you  
And when the world was through  
Then one by one the stars would all go out  
  
Then you and I would simply fly away

If love is real why can't you take love  
And lock love away in some safe place  
Where you won't lose love and keep love  
Each day untouched, so warm and near  
Where love will stay, so pure and clear  
The evenings pass and I wonder  
Where you are sleeping tonight  
Are you awake running through memories  
Remembering how good it felt when love took hold  
Our future plans that won't unfold  
Now days are long  
Just patches of time thrown together like clouds  
Of empty hours blinded by pictures of places we knew  
And now in space I stare  
Without your soul and voice to share  
It all seems lost  
Left are just words but without much to say  
'Cause if love's real  
You have to trust and let love go its way  
If love is real  
If love is real  
If love is real  

If not for you, babe I couldn't even find the door  
I couldn't even see the floor  
I'd be sad and blue, if not for you  
  
If not for you, babe, the night would see me wide awake  
The day would surely have to break  
It would not be new, if not for you  
  
[Chorus]  
If not for you, my sky would fall, rain would gather too  
Without your love I'd be nowhere at all, I'd be lost, if not for you  
  
If not for you, the Winter would hold no Spring  
Couldn't hear a Robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If not for you, the Winter would hold no Spring  
You couldn't hear a robin sing  
I just wouldn't have a clue, if not for you  
If not for you

If we only have love  
Then tomorrow will dawn  
And the days of our years  
Will rise on that morn  
If we only have love  
To embrace without fears  
We will kiss with our eyes  
We will sleep without tears  
  
If we only have love  
With our arms open wide  
Then the young and the old  
Will stand at our side  
  
If we only have love  
Love that's falling like rain  
Then the parched desert earth  
Will grow green again  
  
If we only have love  
For the Him that we shout  
For the song that we sing  
Then we'll have a way out  
  
I we only have love  
Then Jerusalem Stands  
And then death has no shadow  
There are no foreign lands  
  
If we only have love  
We will never bow down  
We'll be tall as the pines  
Neither heroes nor clowns  
  
If we only have love  
To be shared with all men  
We will drink from the grail  
To be born once again  
  
Then with nothing at all  
But the little we are  
We'll have conquered all time,  
All space, the sun and the stars.

You came when I was happy in your sunshine  
I grew to love you more each passing day  
Before too long I built my world around you  
And I prayed you'd love enough of me to stay  
  
If you love me let me know  
If you don't then let me go  
I can't take another minute  
Of a day without you in it  
If you love me let it be  
If you don't then set me free  
Take the chains away  
That keep me loving you  
  
The arms that open wide to hold me closer  
The hands that run their fingers through my hair  
The smile that says "hello, it's good to see you"  
Anytime I turn around to find you there  
  
It's this and so much more that make me love you  
What else can I do to make you see  
You know you have whatever is mine to give you  
But a love affair for one can never be  
  
If you love me let me know  
If you don't then let me go  
I can't take another minute  
Of a day without you in it  
If you love me let it be  
If you don't then set me free  
Take the chains away  
That keep me loving you  
Take the chains away  
That keep me loving you  
Loving you

I'm counting on you  
Ever since we met darling  
I've been keeping score  
Every day I count your charms  
Every day I love you more  
It's plain to see why you're the lover I waited for  
  
I'm counting the different ways you melt me  
Your smile, your voice, your touch  
I'm counting the little things you tell me  
That move me, oh so much  
I'm counting your kisses and caresses  
And 'cause I thrill as I do  
For I'm counting on you  
  
I'm counting the hours since I found you  
The days and nights divine  
I'm counting the dreams I built around you  
Because your love is mine  
I'm counting on happiness forever  
Oh lover, always be true  
For I'm counting on you  
  
I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you  
I'm counting on you

(Carol Hall)  
Jenny Rebecca, four days old  
How do you like the world so far  
Jenny Rebecca, four days old  
What a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky girl you are  
For you have swings to be swung on  
Trees to be climbed up  
Days to be young on  
Toys you can wind up  
Grass to be lying on  
Sun up above  
Pillows for crying on  
When you're in love  
Ponies for riding on  
Wind in your hair  
Slides to be sliding on  
Leaves in the air  
Dolls to be caring for  
Love to be giving  
Dreams to be daring for  
Long as you're living  
Yes, you have dreams to be daring for  
Long as you're living  
Jenny Rebecca, four days old  
What a lucky, lucky, lucky, lucky girl you are  
  

Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
I'm begging of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Just because you can  
  
Your beauty is beyond compare  
With flaming locks of auburn hair  
With ivory skin and eyes of amber green  
Your smile is like a breath of spring  
Your voice is soft like summer rain  
And I can not compete with you, Jolene  
  
He talks about you in his sleep  
And there's nothing I can do to keep  
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene  
And I can easy understand how you can easy take my man  
But you don't know what he means to me, Jolene  
  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
I'm begging of you  
Please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him  
Just because you can  
  
Now, you could have your choice of men  
But I could never love again  
He's the only one for me, Jolene  
I had to have this talk with you  
My happiness depends on you  
And whatever you decide to do, Jolene  
  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
I'm begging of you please don't take my man  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene  
Please don't take him even though you can  
  
Jolene

Sometimes I think I love you  
Just a little too much  
You know you thrill me baby  
With you magic touch  
That's why I want you honey  
And I love you like I do  
I'm gonna scream and shout it  
There ain't no doubt about it  
That's why I love you like I do  
  
Sometimes I think you kiss me  
Just a little too much  
You drive me crazy baby,  
With your magic touch  
You make me feel so good  
When the moon is shining bright  
With our lips together  
And you're squeezin' me so tight  
  
Now, I went steady once before  
Thought I loved the boy next door  
He stepped out on me, you see  
He couldn't be true  
Now, I got over all my dreams  
Time went by so fast it seems  
Now I know I'll never get over you  
Well, all right, all right  
  
Sometimes I think I love you  
Just a little too much  
You know you thrill me baby  
With you magic touch  
That's why I want you honey  
And I love you like I do  
I'm gonna scream and shout it  
There ain't no doubt about it  
That's why I love you like I do  
That's why I love you like I do

Cold winds rarely blow  
Here at the end of the rainbow  
Guess it's hard to believe  
I'd be willing to leave  
Someone walked up behind me  
Seemed to find me  
I felt him standing there, I turned around and  
Saw the face of an angel, I fell  
It wasn't fair, it just wasn't fair  
He took my heart, it was a landslide  
You know it was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs  
My needs won't be denied  
It was a landslide  
Somehow I'm thrilled by all he says  
High on his campaign promises  
I don't wanna come down  
I don't wanna come down  
But no promises he made me could persuade me  
Like the loneliness that comes on when I  
Try to go on without him  
Try to doubt him  
I confess, I have to confess  
He took my heart, it was a landslide  
You know it was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs  
My needs won't be denied  
It was a landslide  
I'm in heaven when he's around  
In heaven when he's around  
And I'm hoping that he might be  
Feeling the same as me  
I'm in heaven, heaven  
It isn't hard to see  
He took my heart, it was a landslide  
You know it was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs  
My needs won't be denied  
It was a landslide  
I'm gonna tell everybody I see  
He's the only party for me  
It really was a, it really was a  
You know it was a landslide  
It really was a landslide  
My head was saying this is the man  
My heart agreed  
My minor desires turned to major needs-acapo  
  

A woman needs attention like the flowers need the sun  
'Cause without that attention Lord a woman feels undone  
And Lord I'm like a flower that's been standing in the rain  
Hoping Lord and praying that the sun will shine again  
  
Is there anybody out there who can shine  
Any time would be fine  
Is there anybody out there who can glow  
And would like to see a little flower grow  
Shine on me, let it shine  
  
A woman needs a love light to keep her body warm  
'Cause Lord without that love light  
Well her mind can do her harm  
And Lord that light's gone out for me  
I'm standing in the dark hoping Lord  
And praying just to see a little start  
  
Is there anybody out there who can shine  
Any time would be fine  
Is there anybody out there who can glow  
And would like to see this woman's love light show  
Shine on me, let it shine

Wherever you go, wherever  
You may wander in your life  
Surely you know, I  
Always wanna be there  
  
Holding your hand  
And standing by to  
Catch you when you fall  
Seeing you through  
In everything you do  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me be there in your morning  
Let me be there in your night  
Let me change whatever's  
Wrong and make it right  
Let me take you  
Through that wonderland  
That only two can share  
All I ask you is let me be there  
  
Watching you grow and going  
Through the changes in your life  
That's how I know, I'll  
Always wanna be there  
  
Whenever you feel you need  
A friend to lean on, here I am  
Whenever you call  
You know I'll be there  
  
[Chorus:] 2X  
  
All I ask you is let me be there

The river keeps on rolling  
My life stream keeps on flowing  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
My dreams call on tomorrow  
My love knows all my sorrow  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
  
Stay with me and we'll find a way  
I'll be your night if you'll be my day  
Through the dawn and beyond the sky  
We can fly, you and I  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
  
The river keeps on rolling  
My life stream keeps on flowing  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul  
Only you know what you're doing to my soul

When I'm down on my luck and I'm searching for my soul  
When I'm feeling too much and I start to lose control  
When I'm down so low that even enemies don't want to know  
You still care for me say a prayer for me and I know  
Ooo I like you hanging around  
Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Ooo you are my favourite sound  
Cause you're always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't want to let you go  
When I'm lost along way and I can't face another day  
And if I stumble on the road and if I can't carry the load  
And if I lose my faith, and kindness, and generousity  
Would you hold my hand?  
Say you understand my pain  
Ooo I like you hanging around  
Cause you lift me up when I am upside down  
Ooo you are my favourite sound  
Cause you're always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't want to let you go  
It's been a long hard road and it's only just begun my friend  
And this I know you helped me carry the load  
Cause you're always down for  
Lifting me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
Whell you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit the ground  
Feel your arms all around me when I'm feeling down  
Lift me up like an angel when I hit my low  
When your arms are around me  
I don't want to let you go  
I don't want to let you go  
Cause you lift me up now  
Whell you're always around...  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up now  
You lift me up  
Lift me up now  
Yeah you're always around  
You're my favourite sound  
Lift me up  
Ohh...Year...

Little star of Bethlehem  
Perfect as a pearl  
Waiting for our eyes to turn  
And our faith to unfurl  
How I pray that you will cast  
Your light upon the world  
Shine on  
Flame of peace  
Flame of hope  
Oh help us believe  
Those who wait with hungry hearts  
Clinging to despair  
Those whose souls are bound in chains  
The lonely everywhere  
Show them that we hear their cry  
Show them that we care  
Shine on  
Flame of peace  
Flame of hope  
Oh help us believe  
From the west  
To the east  
Shine on us  
We shall be released  

There's no power capable of  
Coming between us--dividing our love  
To be faithful I have sworn  
Together we can weather the storm  
  
Our tomorrows are ticking away  
Our hands are tied--we're victims of fate  
In my darkness I will pray  
For destiny to send me your way  
  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
  
Love make me strong  
The seven seas won't keep us apart  
Not with an ocean of love in my heart  
My devotion will see me through  
  
'Cause nothing's gonna keep me from you  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
Love make me strong  
Oh it's a sad sad story  
True lovers forced to part  
  
Shot down in all it's glory  
You'll hear the sound of broken hearts  
My devotion will see me through  
'Cause nothing's gonna keep me from you  
  
Love make me strong  
Give me the strength to carry on  
Love make me strong  
A tower of strength to lean upon  
  
Love make me strong  
Oh oh love make me strong  
Love make me strong, make me strong  
Love make me strong

The words i have to say  
May well be simple but they're true  
Until you give your love  
There's nothing more that we can do  
  
Love is the opening door  
Love is what we came here for  
No one could offer you more  
Do you know what i mean?  
Have your eyes really seen?  
  
You say it's very hard  
To leave behind the life we knew  
But there's no other way  
And now it's really up to you  
  
Love is the key we must turn  
Truth is the flame we must burn  
Freedom the lesson we must learn  
Do you know what i mean?  
Have your eyes really seen?  
  
Love is the key we must turn  
Truth is the flame we must burn  
Freedom the lesson we must learn  
Do you know what i mean?  
Have your eyes really seen?  
Do you know what i mean?  
Have your eyes really seen?

Watching the shadow dance  
Reflected in your eyes  
Open up and take a chance - talk to me  
Don't hold everything inside  
And if you want me say  
Hold me now - hold me now  
And it's ok to say - please hold me now  
  
Lay your head down in my arms  
Whispering my name  
Go ahead and fall asleep  
Dream the night away  
  
I love you right - I love you wrong  
I love you weak - I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy - I'll ease your pain  
I'll take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby - I love you crazy  
  
My hands are innocent - my arms are open wide  
There's nothing to fight against  
I'll help you thru the stone cold night  
And if you feel afraid - reach for me - reach for me now  
Cause I can't stand the wait - reach for me now  
  
I'll be here when you awake  
Whispering your name  
Here's a promise I will make  
My love will never change  
  
I love you right - I love you wrong  
I love you weak - I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy - I'll ease your pain  
I'll take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby  
  
I love you crazy high and crazy low  
More than you will ever know  
I will love you crazy all my life  
I love you right  
I love wrong  
I love you weak  
I love you strong  
  
I love you right - I love you wrong  
I love you weak - I love you strong  
I love you crazy everyday and all night long  
I share your joy - I'll ease your pain  
I'll take your sunshine and your rain  
Oh my baby - I love you crazy

Once they were lovers but now they're not friends  
She's found another, he says it's the end  
To think they once tore down the wall for a door  
But now they don't speak anymore  
  
So he walks the streets, the few nights he can stand  
Drinking her memory away when he can  
Friends once would reach out to them from the shore  
But now they don't cry anymore  
  
How does it all come to happen  
That's not what loving is for  
And if I thought it was, I'd leave here in the morning  
I'd sooner sleep on the floor  
  
Oh when will we learn really what loving is  
It's not what you get in return but what you give  
To think they once tore down the wall for a door  
But now they don't speak anymore

Come take my hand  
You should know me  
I've always been in your mind  
You know that I'll be kind  
I'll be guiding you  
  
Building your dream  
Has to start now  
There's no other road to take  
You won't make a mistake  
I'll be guiding you  
  
You have to believe we are magic  
Nothing can stand in our way  
You have to believe we are magic  
Don't let your aim ever stray  
And if all your hopes survive  
Your destiny will arrive  
I'll bring all your dreams alive  
For you  
  
From where I stand  
You are home free  
The planets align so rare  
There's promise in the air  
And I'm guiding you  
  
Through every turn I'll be near you  
I'll come anytime you call  
I'll catch you when you fall  
I'll be guiding you  
  
You have to believe we are magic  
Nothing can stand in our way  
You have to believe we are magic  
Don't let your aim ever stray  
And if all your hopes survive  
Your destiny will arrive  
I'll bring all your dreams alive  
For you

I can tell you got plans for me  
And your eyes are saying you made them carefully  
But tonight I have to say there just might be another way  
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
I'm the one you want, that's all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
You made the prettiest speech I've heard  
But a single touch surely is worth a thousand words  
To a heart that's open wide and from the start was on your side  
Won't you spare me all the charms and take me in your arms  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
I'm the one you want, that's all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I can't wait, I can't wait  
  
I'm the one you want, that's all I want to be  
So come on baby make a move on me  
Got nowhere to go, all my time is free  
So come on baby make a move on me tonight  
I can't wait, I can't wait

Although I know our love is going strong  
Little surprises kind of help it along  
We mustn't let our lives become routine  
Don't do anything we don't mean  
There is no limit on love at all  
It can always get better the deeper you fall  
I'm sure without that love we won't survive  
So come on and show itlet's keep it alive  
And we'll be making a good thing better  
But with luck it's gonna last forever  
You'll see  
Making a good thing better  
That's the way we're gonna stay together  
You and me  
If we're to make each other satisfied  
Gotta keep on tryin'don't let it ride  
It all comes over in the morning kiss  
Don't do it like thatdo it like this  
Making a good thing better  
But with luck it's gonna last forever  
You'll see  
Making a good thing better  
That's the way we're gonna stay together  
You and me  
Make it so much better  
It is better better  
Make it so much better  
Make it better better  
Make it better better better  
Make it better better better  
Make it better better better  
Better better  
Making a good thing better  
But with luck it's gonna last forever  
You'll see  
Making a good thing better  
That's the way we're gonna stay together  
You and me  

Mary Skeffington, close your eyes  
And make believe that you are just a girl again  
Go to sleep tonight, dream of days  
When you had something there to light the way  
  
Remember a holiday in a north of England town  
You slept in a room upstairs on a bed of eiderdown  
  
Mary Skeffington, when you wake  
You mustn't be afraid to face another day  
Think of what you had, you'll get by  
You've always been a lady, hold your head up high  
  
Look back on your home where you spent the best years of your life  
Remember the man who asked you if you would be his wife

Busted flat in Baton rouge, headin' for the train  
Feelin' nearly faded as my jeans  
Bobby thumbed a diesel down just before it rained  
Took us all the way to New Orleans  
  
I took my harpoon out of my dirty red bandanna  
I was blowin' sad while Bobby sang the blues  
With them windshield wipers slappin' time  
And Bobby clappin' hands  
We finally sang up every song that driver knew  
  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free  
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
Buddy, that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee  
  
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Standin' right beside me through everything I've done  
And every night he kept me from the cold  
  
Then somewhere near Salinas I let him slip away  
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find  
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine  
  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
Nothin' left is all he left me, yeah  
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
Buddy, that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee  
  
Enough for me and Bobby McGee  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee  
  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
And nothin' ain't worth nothin' but it's free  
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
Buddy, that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee  
  
From the coal mines of Kentucky to the California sun  
Bobby shared the secrets of my soul  
Standin' right beside me through everything I've done  
And every night he kept me from the cold  
  
Then somewhere near Salinas I let him slip away  
Lookin' for the home I hope he'll find  
And I'll trade all my tomorrows for a single yesterday  
Holdin' Bobby's body next to mine  
  
Freedom's just another word for nothin' left to lose  
Nothin' left is all he left me  
Feelin' good was easy, Lord, when Bobby sang the blues  
Buddy, that was good enough for me  
Good enough for me and Bobby McGee  
  
Enough for me and Bobby McGee  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah  
I let him slip away lookin' for the home I hope he finds  
Enough for me and my Bobby McGee  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah  
Good enough for me and my Bobby McGee, yeah

Here again drawn like a moth to a flame  
An invisible force pulling me close to you  
I can't break free  
There's some kind of hold over me  
Like a magnet, you attract me like steel  
I'm a kamikaze pilot, it's a one-way flight  
Getting to you is getting to me  
Must be lack of oxygen  
I'm a do or die fanatic, no rationale  
Cause anyone else could tell  
You don't stand a snowball's chance in hell  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time before I get  
Over my head in your quicksand bed  
The more I struggle the more I'm sucked in  
Here again drawn like a moth to a flame  
An invisible force pulling me close to you  
I'm a kamikaze pilot, it's a one-way flight  
Getting to you is getting to me  
Must be lack of oxygen  
I'm a do or die fanatic, no rationale  
Cause anyone else could tell  
You don't stand a snowball's chance in hell  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time before I get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A fatal attraction  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time  
Moth to a flame  
Missing you in action  
I'm flying too close to the sun  
Sooner or later, you're gonna get burned  
Moth to a flame  
A lethal reaction  
I'm loving you under the gun  
It's just a matter of time

Hey boy, I better warn you  
To make your reservation  
Your exit's overdue  
I can only promise he ain't the soul to laugh  
I've known him long enough to speak on his behalf  
  
My old man's got a gun  
And he knows you're a tricky one  
He can't fail to make you run  
And I don't need you  
My old man's got a wife  
And she loves him and her life  
Silver tongue could be his strife  
And I don't need you  
  
Hey boy, don't let him fool you  
I'll tell you something about him, gonna cool you  
He'll get you in a corner  
And make you really crawl  
You'll never realize  
A man could feel so small  
  
My old man's got a gun  
And he knows you're a tricky one  
He can't fail to make you run  
And I don't need you  
My old man's got a wife  
And she loves him and her life  
Silver tongue could be his strife  
And I don't need you  
  
I don't need you, I don't need you  
Hey boy, I better warn you  
To make your reservation

Twelve hours a day ain't such a long time  
It's only a means to an end  
He thinks that his pay will buy her devotion  
But he's only payin' for her to pretend  
  
What more can he do but give her his heart  
Wrapped up in a love so sincere  
Lookin' around at all that they have  
It seems clear  
  
That it's never enough, never never enough  
Why is all that we have simply never enough?  
No it's never enough, never never enough  
It's so sad  
  
Is anything ever enough?  
She ran out of time for people who loved her  
Their love couldn't get her nowhere  
Isn't it sad she started collecting  
  
Friends who are strangers but she doesn't care  
Surrounding herself with phonies and fools  
Who tell her what she wants to hear  
Looking around at all that they have it seems clear  
  
That it's never enough, never never enough  
Why is all that we have simply never enough?  
No it's never enough, never never enough  
It's so sad  
  
Is anything ever enough?  
Why must we want so much more than we have?  
Will we never be satisfied?  
Just look around  
  
How can we feel so denied?  
But it's never enough, never never enough  
Why is all that we have simply never enough?  
No, it's never enough, never never enough  
  
It's so sad  
Is anything ever enough?  
Enough  
[Repeat]

Every day I'd wake and ask myself  
Was I strong enough for you  
Foolish doubts and fears took me away  
I'm sorry now you never knew  
For so long I've wondered where you are  
Underneath a tapestry of stars  
In my heart I knew you'd come again  
I just didn't know where or when  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven waits for us  
Through loves open door  
And it's brought you back to me once more  
Heart don't fail me now  
Now that you are near  
Love was never far away from here  
I have tried to make some sense of this  
Guess I needed time away  
Once I realized how foolish I've been  
I couldn't waste another day  
I forgive you with my heart and soul  
And now it's time for us to lose control  
Take me in your arms like you did before  
Darling don't talk anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere deep inside I always knew  
That I was meant to spend my life with you  
You're the only answer to my prayers  
I knew that love would lead us back somewhere  
Through love's open door  
And it's brought you back to me once more  
Heart don't fail me now  
Now that you are near  
Love was never far away from here

New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the ways of the world  
Or astronauts upon the moon, or witches on brooms  
New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the politics of people  
Or chess pieces, or old churches  
You just know your mother  
  
New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the way it's gonna be  
Or clown faces or masterpieces  
Or love affairs or rocking chairs  
I see you sleeping away, getting older every day  
  
New-born babe  
Don't know nothing 'bout the way it's gonna be  
Or clown faces or masterpieces  
Or love affairs or rocking chairs  
I see you sleeping away  
Oh, you're getting older every day

(Olivia Newton-John)  
I--I want to spend my life with you  
No other love  
Could make me feel this way  
What I can be myself  
And live the truth  
No other love has ever let me be myself  
When I'm with you my heart feels free  
To open up  
And I'm never afraid to love  
Surrendering to your sweet touch  
I can face the years if I'm with you  
No other love  
Can make me feel this sure  
That I have found a tenderness so pure  
No other love  
Has ever helped my heart feel bold  
I'm never afraid of growing old  
When I'm with you  
And I'm happy to be alone  
Believin' you are always close  
I thought that older was wiser  
But now I have to think again  
I'll spend my days of wine and roses  
Romancing a friend  
I--I want to spend my life with you  
No other love could make me feel this way  
Where I can be myself  
And live the truth  
No other love has ever let me be myself  
When I'm with you my heart feels free to open up  
And I'm never afraid to love  
Surrendering to your sweet touch  
Oh I--I want to spend my life with you  
Oh I--I want to spend my life with you  
Oh I--I want to spend my life with you  
No other love but you  
  
  

Here we are in a room full of broken hearts  
Lovers once, but in the end, we never really had a chance  
You wanted to be free, now that you're lonely, you want me back again  
  
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call  
Not gonna take the fall, for all your indecision  
Not gonna put my back to the wall  
Not gonna take the fall, for all the pain you've given  
  
Me and you, we were a dream that never could come true  
In time you'll see, that our love was never really meant to be  
And if you discover, you need a lover, someone to break your fall  
  
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call  
Not gonna take the fall, for all your indecision  
Not gonna put my back to the wall  
Not gonna take the fall, for all the pain you've given  
  
You wanted to be free, now that you're lonely, you want me at your arm  
  
But I'm not gonna be the one that you call  
Not gonna take the fall, for all your indecision  
Not gonna put my back to the wall  
Not gonna take the fall, for all the pain you've given  

O Holy night, the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear Saviour's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth  
  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder beams a new and glorious morn  
Fall on your knees  
Oh, hear the angel voices  
O night divine, O night when Christ was born  
O night divine, O night, O night divine  
  
Truly he taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break, for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise me  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
Christ is the Lord  
Then ever, we will praise thee  
O night divine! O night when Christ was born  
O night divine! O night, O night divine

Looks like I'm the only one here  
Even the nurse is gone  
But I guess I should wait 'cause when she left, she said  
The doctor won't be long  
So make yourself at home  
His office is down the hall  
Why do I feel uneasy?  
I know he must be good  
Got credentials all over the wall  
I hear a voice behind me say  
What seems to be the trouble, my dear?  
Won't you be kind enough to step over here  
It might be fever, it might be flu  
To isolate it, I'll have to hold you  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
In my opinion  
All we can do to isolate it  
I'll hold you overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
Please don't think me ungrateful  
But holding me overnight  
Seems a little extreme  
Do you always serve martinis  
And turn the lights down low  
Doctor, do your colleagues know?  
Although you say it's good for me  
I really don't feel like dancing now  
Somebody's waiting and I'm double-parked anyhow  
It might be fever, it might be flu  
To isolate it, I'll have to hold you  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
In my opinion  
All we can do to isolate it  
I'll hold you overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
Now, I may look stupid  
But I'll tell you what  
I've been around a long time  
And I thought I had heard everything  
I tell you, they keep coming up with them  
I just couldn't believe my ears when he said  
Kick off your shoes, relax my dear  
Slip into something comfortable  
Two seconds flat, I'm out the door and down the hall  
It might be fever, it might be flu  
To isolate it, I'll have to hold you  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight  
(Observation)  
In my opinion  
All we can do to isolate it  
I'll hold you overnight  
(Observation)  
Overnight

Look at this stuff, isn't it neat?  
Wouldn't you think my collection's complete?  
Wouldn't you think I'm the girl,  
The girl who has everything?  
Look at this trove, treasures untold  
How many wonders can one cavern hold?  
Lookin' around here you'd think  
Sure, she's got everything  
  
I've got gadgets and gizmos aplenty  
I've got whooz-its and whatz-its galore  
You want thingamabobs?  
I got twenty  
But who cares?  
No big deal  
I want more  
  
I want to be where the people are  
I want to see  
want to see 'em dancing  
Walking around on those  
Whadd'ya call 'em? oh- feet  
Flipping your fins you don't get too far  
Legs are required for jumping, dancing  
Strolling along down a  
What's that word again? Street  
  
Up where they walk  
Up where they run  
Up where they stay all day in the sun  
Wandering free  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world  
  
What would I give  
If I could live  
Out of these waters?  
What would I pay  
To spend a day  
Warm on the sand?  
Betcha on land  
They understand  
That they don't reprimand their daughters  
Bright young women  
Sick of swimming  
Ready to stand  
  
And ready to know what the people know  
Ask 'em my questions  
And get some answers  
What's a fire and why does it  
What's the word? burn?  
  
When's it my turn?  
Wouldn't I love  
Love to explore that shore above?  
Out of the sea  
Wish I could be  
Part of that world

Pretty women wonder  
Where my secret lies  
I'm not cute or built to suit  
A fashion model's size  
But when I start to tell them  
They think I'm telling lies.  
  
I say  
It's in the reach of my arms  
The span of my hips  
The stride of my steps  
The curl of my lips.  
  
I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
(Yes indeed)  
'Cause I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby that's me.  
  
I walk into a room  
Just as cool as you please  
And to a man  
The fellows stand or  
Fall down on their knees  
Then they swarm around me  
Like a hive of honey bees.  
  
I say  
It's the fire in my eyes  
And the flash of my teeth  
The swing of my waist  
The joy in my feet.  
  
I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
(Yes indeed)  
'Cause I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby that's me.  
  
It's in the arch of my back  
The sun of my smile  
The ride of my breasts  
The grace of my style.  
  
Now you understand  
Just why my head's not bowed  
I don't shout  
Or jump about  
Or have to talk real loud  
When you see me passing  
It ought to make you proud.  
  
I say  
It's in the click of my heels  
The bend of my hair  
The palm of my hand  
The need for my care.  
  
I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
(Yes indeed)  
'Cause I'm a woman  
Phenomenal woman  
Baby that's me.  
Baby that's me yeah

I want to love you once again  
Couldn't you love me too  
Don't turn away from all that we've been through  
Everyone changes, be my friend  
Haven't you got the time  
Help me I need you, throw me down a line  
  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't hold on much longer  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't love you any stronger  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again  
  
Living on dreams from yesterday  
Waking and you're not here  
I want to see your face  
I want you near  
Now is the moment we must live  
You can't run and hide  
I know you want me too  
Down deep inside  
  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't hold on much longer  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't love you any stronger  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again  
  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't hold on much longer  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't love you any stronger  
Please don't keep me waiting  
I can't take this kind of pain  
Take me back in your arms once again

In this world where life keeps changin'  
Nothin' ever seems to be enough  
I kept on, my soul was searchin'  
Lookin' for something that would fill me up  
I have always felt a yearnin'  
Somethin' inside me was unsatisfied  
  
Precious love you woke my heart up  
It's been sleepin' for such a long time  
This crazy feelin' I can believe in  
Your love has found it's way into my life  
  
Take our time, slow and easy  
I'm so comfortable when I'm with you  
Catch my breath when you come near me  
Can't control this if I wanted to  
Thought I'd never trust another  
But here, in your arms, I feel safe again  
  
Precious love you woke my heart up  
It's been sleepin' for such a long time  
This crazy feelin' I must be dreamin'  
Your love has found it's way into my life  
  
You touched a part of me  
And set my spirit free  
Precious love  
  
This crazy feelin' I must be dreamin'  
Your love has found it's way into my life  
You know your precious love has changed my life

(olivia newton-john)  
  
See them play in the moonlight  
Watch them dance in the sun  
They're the children of freedom--everyone  
As they care for each other  
With no question or cause  
They deserve to be treasured as a source of love  
  
In their minds there are answers  
And in time we will know  
What the truth is about all we don't know  
They have no room for hatred  
Though they've suffered much pain  
From the race we call human--who are afraid of love  
  
If I can only help to right a wrong  
With my dolphin song  
Then i'll have done what I set out to do  
If I can only make one man aware  
One person care  
Then i'll have done what I promised you  
  
Let us hope it's not too late  
And that we can amend  
All the pain we have suffered on a friend  
We were born with our freedom  
Oh we were born with the truth  
Then why do we abuse it  
We could choose--to love, to love

When you go through a day  
And the things that people say  
They make you feel so small  
They make you feel that  
Your heart will just never stop aching  
And when you just can't accept the abuse you are taking  
Darlin' reach out for me  
Don't you worry, I'll see you through  
You just have to reach out for me  
I'll be there and I'll comfort you  
Oh yes, I will  
Comfort you and love you  
Oh how I'm gonna love you  
When good friends prove untrue  
And the things they do to you  
They make you feel so bad  
They make you feel that  
You haven't a reason for living  
So when you feel you  
Could throw in the towel and just give in  
Darlin' reach out for me  
Don't you worry, I'll see you through  
You just have to reach out for me  
I'll be there and I'll comfort you  
Oh yes, I will  
Comfort you and love you  
Oh how I'm gonna love you  
They make you feel that  
Your heart will just never stop aching  
And when you just can't accept the abuse you are taking  
Darlin' reach out for me  
Don't you worry, I'll see you through  
You just have to reach out for me  
I'll be there and I'll comfort you  
Oh yes, I will  
Comfort you and love you  
Oh how I'm gonna love you

I live on an island far away  
All by myself, there's no one else  
Nobody calls but that's okay  
Don't need their help, I'm by myself  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me, deserting me  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery  
When I go wrong as people do  
There's only me to answer to  
Nobody here to bring me down  
No feelings I need step around  
Trouble and care are waiting out there  
But I'm alright, I'm safe tonight  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery  
Don't need your sympathy, save all your tears  
I've lived without tenderness for too many years  
Why would I need it now?  
Nobody here to make a career  
Of hurting me, deserting me  
Your crazy life ain't ever gonna get me  
Don't worry about my recovery  
'Cause lover, you won't recover me  
I'm not too low, I'm not too high  
I'll get by makin' my recovery  

Hush my baby, sweetly sleep  
Do not cry  
I will sing a lullaby  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
Feel my arms that keep you warm  
Snuggling around your tiny form  
Precious baby, sweetly sleep  
Sleep in peace  
Sleep in comfort, slumber deep  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
Close your eyes my darling one  
'Til the new day has begun  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
I will rock you, rock you, rock you  
Sleep in peace 'til day has come  
Darling, darling, little one

If a ship of dreams bid me come, would I board it?  
If I had their gold in my hands, would I hoard it?  
If I knew the trials I must face, would I carry on at all?  
Sail into tomorrow, living day to day  
  
That's all I can afford to do and all I'll ever pay  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring me comfort--Lord help us to survive  
If his pretty eyes shone my way, would I leave you?  
  
If I wasn't sure he would stay, would I deceive you?  
If I had to melt you with promises, would they stand or fall?  
Sail into tomorrow, living day to day  
That's all I can afford to do and all I'll ever pay  
  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring you comfort--Lord help us to survive  
If time should call me a fool, would I laugh or would I care?  
Sail into tomorrow, living day to day  
  
That's all I can afford to do and all I'll ever pay  
Is a song to sing to thank you for making me alive  
And a prayer to bring you comfort--Lord help us to survive

I heard that you're on your own now  
So am I  
I'm living alone now  
I was wrong  
So were you  
What will you do?  
Are you glad to be free?  
Are you feeling lost just like me?  
Longing for company  
  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
Come around and talk awhile  
I need your smile  
You need a shoulder  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
And the door is open wide  
Come on inside  
Longing to see you  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
  
I find the days hard to face now  
Empty rooms  
There's much too much space now  
And the nights go so slow  
I'm sure you know  
Wish I knew what to do  
It would be so nice seeing you  
And it might help you too  
  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
Come around and talk awhile  
I need your smile  
You need a shoulder  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
And the door is open wide  
Come on inside  
Longing to see you  
Oh Sam, Sam, you know where I am  
  
Oh Sam, you know where I am  
Oh Sam, ooh Sam  
You know, you know  
You know where I am

Why do I have to care for you?  
When I should have known to stay away  
Why was I there for you?  
I don't know how I lost my touch  
I never believed that I could ever want  
Somebody's love so much  
Time can shake me loose from the blues  
But who would know I'd be this slow shaking you  
I don't know what I'm looking for  
I just let the arrows go and hope I find what I am shooting for  
So don't say that you'll be there for me  
If you don't care for me, I'll be gone  
'Cause I don't have the strength to be this strong  
Tell me all what to do  
Who knew that I'd take so long shaking you  
Now I'm waiting to hit the ground  
I'm painting my love for you in corners I know I will get around  
Time can shake me loose from the blues  
But who would know I'd be this slow shaking you  
I don't know what I'm looking for  
I just let the arrows go and hope I find what I am shooting for

Christmas makes you feel emotional  
It may be parties or thoughts devotional  
Whatever happens or what may be  
Here is what Christmas time means to me  
  
City sidewalks, busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling of Christmas  
Children laughing, people passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you'll hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of streetlights, even stop-lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
Hear the snow crunch, hear the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big scene  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them ring  
Soon it will be Christmas Day  
Soon it will be Christmas Day

Butterflies danced on invisible strings  
Showing wings they borrowed from a rainbow  
And a blackbird on high sang a praise to the sky  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Furry backed bees with a tireless drone  
Never moan, they're happy to be working  
And a grasshopper green could be heard but not seen  
While a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall  
Nothing moves now but the swaying ripe corn  
Not a dawn is greeted with a bird's song  
There's a feather or two from a bird that once flew  
Before a light aeroplane sprayed the fields  
With a silvery rain  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall  
Fly away, Peter, fly away, Paul  
Before there's nothing left to fly at all  
Take to the sky, higher than high  
Before the silvery rain begins to fall

Smile for me  
Let me know that I will always be  
The one and only one you'll always need  
Baby, smile for me  
Smile for me  
Chase away the cloud that constantly  
Is like a shadow hanging over me  
Baby, smile for me  
Smile your smile of total tenderness  
Smile the smile that takes away the rain  
Smile away my total emptiness  
For I never wanna have to cry again  
Smile for me  
And I'll become the girl you want to see  
No, there's nothing that I can't be  
If you'll just smile for me  
Smile your smile of total tenderness  
Oh smile your smile  
Smile the smile that takes away the rain  
Smile away my total emptiness  
No, I never, never wanna have to cry again  
Smile for me  
And I'll become the girl you want to see  
No, there's nothing that I can't be  
If you'll just smile for me  
No, there's nothing, nothing that I can't be  
If you'll just smile for me  
Smile for me  

Well I've been so far away from you  
Though standin' by your side  
And there were nights we were so in love  
That lovin' made me blind  
But that time is so far below us now  
The memory so thin  
It's so easy to begin  
But it's so hard to stop this love  
It's just so hard to stop  
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in  
It's so easy to begin  
And I've at least saved some lessons from  
A time I fell apart  
And I know you've been wondering why  
I look at you so hard  
But I never want to wake up someday  
And wonder where we've been  
It's so easy to begin  
But it's so hard to stop this love  
It's just so hard to stop  
When a heart that's lookin' for lovin' leads you in  
It's so easy to begin  

I try to be patient--I try not to moan  
But it's driving me crazy trying to live here alone  
My conversation gets nowhere when I talk to myself  
I've lost my sense of humor somewhere here on the shelf  
  
The moon is wasting its shine shining on me  
Until I see you again  
I won't be out in the moonlight  
And I'll be sleeping by ten  
The birds are wasting their song singing to me  
Until I'm waking with you  
Until you're back in my arms dear  
The birds will have to find something better to do  
  
A shoulder to cry on would make me feel fine  
But it's not much comfort when I'm crying on mine  
Friends and relations are running out of patience with me  
I keep myself to myself but I'm no company  
  
The moon is wasting its shine shining on me  
Until I see you again  
I won't be out in the moonlight  
And I'll be sleeping by ten  
The birds are wasting their song singing to me  
Until I'm waking with you  
Until you're back in my arms dear  
The birds will have to find something better to do  
Baby, till you're back in my arms  
The birds will have to find something better to do

Now who's to judge who's a saint and who's a sinner  
Lord, it's tough enough to trudge from brunch to dinner  
We seek the light of truth between our white lies  
We sleep away our youth under tattletale skies  
  
Now who's to say who's a sinner and who's a saint  
Who's to say who you can love and who you can't  
Now it's easy for the pot to call the kettle black  
They're just jealous of the hot and lusty sordid lives they led  
  
Ain't it a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
It's a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
It's a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
  
Now we struggled comin' down the chute to take our first breath  
And we struggle for acceptance from birth to death  
But the Lord's too busy tryin' to keep the world on it's feet  
He ain't got time to give a damn about what goes on between the sheets  
  
Ain't it a bitch sortin' out our sordid lives  
It's a bitch when you come to realize  
Got yourself a box of Cracker Jacks  
Then you get a really shitty prize  
It's a bitch sortin' out our sorry little sordid lives

Soul kiss  
You left me dreaming  
Now I wonder are things just what they seem  
Well, I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Soul kiss  
Some nights you get me wondering  
Is this the way  
This is a hunger  
Well, I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Somewhere there is a fire burning  
Somewhere inside  
Somewhere there is a heart that's waiting  
To take a ride  
To take the ride to your soul kiss  
  
So this is what it has to lead to  
Take my hand and make me need tp  
I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Soul kiss  
You left me hoping  
Now I wonder is the door still open  
Well, I get down on my knees (and beg you, baby)  
Get down on my knees  
  
Somewhere there is a fire burning  
Somewhere inside  
Somewhere there is a heart that's waiting  
To take a ride  
To take the ride to your soul kiss

I've been doin' some soul searchin', feel guilty as a girl can feel  
I've got no business smiling, beguiling  
  
I'm caught up in a triangle, no future in this shape I'm in  
So what do I find so appealing, in stealing, tell me  
  
How come a stranger's touch can thrill me so much  
My heart's in jeopardy, he's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
  
I wasn't lookin' around, you know I'm happy with you  
You're a part of me that I can't replace  
But he touched my heart in a new place, he found a space, tell me  
  
How come a stranger's touch can thrill me so much  
My heart's in jeopardy, he's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
  
Can't keep on hurtin', hurtin' you  
  
How come a stranger's touch can thrill me so much  
My heart's in jeopardy, he's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
He's overpowering me, oh what'll I do  
  
Can't keep on, can't keep on, can't keep hurting you  
Can't keep on, can't keep on, can't keep hurting you  
Can't keep on, can't keep on, can't keep hurting you  

I've survived so many things  
From broken hearts to shattered dreams  
In every wall I've found an open door  
I'd miss a step, I'd learn to dance  
Come back again with half a chance  
Stronger than before  
There were times I couldn't see  
Beyond the blue inside of me  
A thousand miles away from shore  
But every moment, every day  
With every step I find my way  
Stronger than before  
I believe in miracles, I believe in dreams  
Through the pain I've come to know  
How far the heart can reach  
A spark of hope in sorrow's place  
Will shine with such amazing grace  
Stronger than before  
I believe in miracles, I believe in dreams  
Through the pain I've come to know  
How far the heart can reach  
A spark of hope in sorrow's place  
Will shine with such amazing grace  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before  
Stronger than before  

She walks in and I'm suddenly a hero  
I'm taken in my hopes begin to rise  
Look at me can't you tell I'd be so  
Thrilled to see the message in your eyes  
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream  
And then suddenly it's all there  
  
Suddenly the wheels are in motion  
And I, I'm ready to sail any ocean  
Suddenly I don't need the answers  
'Cause I, I'm ready to take all my chances with you  
  
How can I feel you're all that matters  
I'd rely on anything you say  
I'll take care that no illusions shatter  
If you dare to say what you should say  
You make it seem I'm so close to my dream  
And then suddenly it's all there  
  
Suddenly the wheels are in motion  
And I, I'm ready to sail any ocean  
Suddenly I don't need the answers  
'Cause I, I'm ready to take all my chances with you  
  
Why do I feel so alive when you're near  
There's no way any hurt can get through  
Longing to spend every moment of the day with you  
  
Suddenly the wheels are in motion  
And I, I'm ready to sail any ocean  
Suddenly I don't need the answers  
'Cause I, I'm ready to take all my chances with you

Summer loving had me a blast  
Summer loving happened so fast  
I met a girl crazy for me  
Met a boy cute as can be  
Summer days drifting away to oh oh the summer nights  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Did you get very far  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Like does he have a car  
  
She swam by me she got a cramp  
He ran by me got my suit damp  
I saved her life she nearly drowned  
He showed off splashing around  
Summer sun somethings begun but oh oh the summer nights  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Was it love at first sight?  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Did she put up a fight?  
  
Took her bowling in the arcade  
We went strolling drank lemonade  
We made out under the dock  
We stayed out till 10 o'clock  
Summer fling don't mean a thing but oh oh the summer nights.  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
But you don't gotta brag  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Cause he sounds like a drag  
  
He got friendly holding my hand  
She got friendly down in the sand  
He was sweet just turned eighteen  
Well she was good you know what I mean  
Summer heat boy and girl meet but oh oh the summer nights.  
  
Tell me more, tell me more  
How much dough did he spend?  
Tell me more, tell me more  
Could she get me a friend?  
  
It turned colder that's where it ends  
So I told her we'd still be friends  
Then we made our true love vow  
Wonder what she's doing now  
  
Summer dreams ripped at the seams but oh those summer nights

Well I'm gonna raise a fuss and I'm gonna raise a hollar  
I've been working all summer just to try to earn a dollar  
Well the time will come baby whn I try to get a date  
My boss says no dice girl ya gotta work late  
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do  
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
Well my momma and brother told me girl ya gotta make some money  
If you want to use the car to go a-riding next Sunday  
Well I din't go to work, I told the boss I was sick  
You can't use the car 'cause you didn't work late  
Sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do  
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
I'm gonna take two weeks gonna have a fine vacation  
Gonna take my problem to the United Nations  
Well I called the Congressman and he said quote:  
I'd like to help ya honey but you're too young to vote  
Huh, sometimes I wonder what I'm a-gonna do  
But there ain't no cure for the summertime blues  
  
Ain't no cure, no no  
Ain't no cure, no no

I carry her with me  
I carry her pride  
Whenever I speak her name  
My soul it comes alive  
  
She taught me to be strong  
She taught me to fight  
And I am who I am today  
Because she raised me right  
  
[Chorus]  
In a sunburned country  
Her magic and her mystery  
In a sunburned country  
Forever will be home to me  
Oh that's where my heart is truly free  
  
The creeks and the rivers  
The dust and the mud  
All of us understand  
This land gets in your blood  
  
The sight of the blue gum's  
And black cockatoos  
White snow Kosciusko  
Red rock Uluru  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We've always been humble  
Too scared to be proud  
I think its time that  
We all stand and say  
We love our home out loud  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I love all the people  
I love all the sounds  
Sleeping under a tin roof  
With a hard rain coming down

A child and a fool in one  
So sure i could need no one  
My heart always on the run to nowhere  
Now as you're holding me  
My heart is reminding me  
That now I could never be without you  
  
But how can our love succeed  
A miracle is what we need  
And so I appeal to you  
  
Keep me suspended in time with you  
Don't let this moment die  
I get a feeling when I'm with you  
None of the rules apply  
But I know for certain  
Goodbye is a crime  
So love if you need me  
Suspend me in time  
  
Wasted the time away  
Holding your love at bay  
Now i can't last a day without you  
Your smile is a thrill to see  
Your eyes hold me tenderly  
They'll shine in my memory forever

Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
  
Almost heaven,West Virginia  
Blue Ridge Mountain,Shenandoe River  
Life is old there,older than the trees  
Younger than the mountains  
  
Growing like the breeze  
Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
  
Take me home,country roads  
All my memories gather round her  
Mine is lady,stranger to blue water  
Dark and dusty painted on the sky  
  
Misty taste of moonshine  
Teardrop in my eye  
Country roads,take me home  
To the place I belong  
  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
I hear her voice in the morning  
Now she calls me  
  
The radio reminds me of my home far away  
And driving down the road I get a feeling  
That I should've been home yesterday,yesterday  
Country roads,take me home  
  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
Country roads,take me home  
  
To the place I belong  
West Virginia,Mountain Mama  
Take me home,country roads  
Take me home,country roads

(Olivia Newton-John)  
When you're having those days when you're feeling deserted  
And everyone leaves you on hold  
When none of your friends seem to care what you're doin'  
And you're feeling old, out in the cold  
When the only thing left of romance is a memory  
And your memory's not strong  
Whenever your clouds lose their silvery lining  
I'll keep you warm, out of the storm  
You don't need no psychiatry  
Come on baby you can talk to me  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
You don't need to be hypnotized  
Lay down here and look me in my eyes  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
Won't you talk to me  
Come on and talk to me  
Oh talk to me  
When you're feeling the blues and there's no one to lean on  
When nobody makes you belong  
You need to be safe in the arms of a someone  
Who'll make you strong, it won't take long  
If you're lookin' for someone that you can believe in  
Let that someone be me  
Can't think of a thing that some lovin' can't handle  
Let's make a start, give me your heart  
You don't need no psychiatry  
Come on baby you can talk to me  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
You don't need to be hypnotized  
Lay down here and look me in my eyes  
Cuddle up on the couch with me  
We can talk all night for free  
Talk to me  
Oh won't you talk to me  
Oh, keep on talking to me  
You gotta, you gotta talk to me  
(repeats)  
  

The late George Wallno worked on High Street and lived on manners  
52 years he sat on his verandah, made his saddles  
And if you had questions about sheep or flowers or doves  
You just asked the saddler, he lived without sin  
They're building a library for him  
  
Time is a traveller  
Tenterfield saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
The son of George Wallno went off and got married and had a war baby  
But something was wrong and it's easier to drink than go crazy  
And if there were questions about why the end was so sad  
Well George had no answers about why her son ever has need of a gun  
  
Time is a traveller  
Tenterfield saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
The grandson of George has been all around the world and lives no special
place  
Changed his last name and he married a girl with an interesting face  
He'd almost forgotten them both because of the life that he leads  
There's nowhere for George and his library or the son with his gun to belong  
Except in this song  
  
Time is a traveller  
Tenterfield saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
Time is a meddler  
Tenterfield Saddler  
Make a bet  
Fly away cockatoo  
Down on the ground  
Emu up ahead  
  
Time is a tale teller  
Tenterfield Saddler  
Turn your head  
Right again jackaroo, think I see kangaroo up ahead  
  
Time is a tale teller  
Tenterfield Saddler  
Make a bet  
Fly away cockatoo  
Down on the ground  
Emu up ahead

So many years gone  
Still I remember  
How did I ever let my heart believe  
In one who never  
Gave enough to me  
  
And so many years gone  
Love that was so wrong  
And I can't forget the way  
It used to be  
And how you changed the touch  
Of love for me  
  
[CHORUS:]  
You were my one more chance  
I never thought I'd find  
You were the one romance  
I've always known in my mind  
No one will ever touch me more  
And I only hope that in return  
I might have saved the best of me  
For you  
  
And we'll have no ending  
If we can hold on  
And I think I've gone this far  
Because of you  
Could be no other love but ours  
Will do  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
No one will ever touch me more  
And I only hope that in return  
No matter how much we have to learn  
I saved the best of me for you

The first Noel  
The angels did say  
Was to certain poor shepherds  
In fields as they lay  
  
In fields where they Lay  
Keeping their sheep  
On a cold winter's night  
That was so deep  
  
They looked up  
And saw a star  
Shining bright in the east  
Beyond them far  
  
And to the earth  
It gave great light  
And so it continued  
Both day and night  
  
Noel,Noel  
Noel,Noel  
Born is the king of Israel  

Earth is our mother  
Just turning around  
With her trees in the forest  
And roots underground  
  
Our father above us  
Whose sigh is the wind  
Paint us a rainbow  
Without any end  
  
As the river runs freely  
The mountain does rise  
Let me touch with my fingers  
And see with my eyes  
  
In the hearts of the children  
A pure love still grows  
Like a bright star in Heaven  
That lights our way home  
  
Like the flower that shattered the stone  
A sparrow finds freedom  
Beholding the sun  
In the infinite beauty  
  
We're all joined in one  
I reach out before me  
And look to the sky  
Did I hear someone whisper  
  
Did something pass by  
As the river runs freely  
The mountain does rise  
Let me touch with my fingers  
  
And see with my eyes  
In the hearts of the children  
A pure love still grows  
Like a bright star in Heaven  
  
That lights our way home  
Like the flower that shattered the stone  
Like a bright star in Heaven  
That lights our way home  
  
Like the flower that shattered the stone

I think there are people who need to be loved  
Lonely and hiding the light from their eyes  
Still too afraid to light up the night  
Too lonely to come out of hiding  
  
Well I've seen you with the young girls  
They come when you call  
They make love so easy  
They don't love at all  
  
You want me to come running  
When your world's falling in  
You want me till you got me  
Then you're gone again  
  
And your passion comes so easy  
Then you ease away from me  
'Cause the last time you loved was the first time you ever cried  
It was the first time you ever really loved  
  
It's the last time you ever tried  
Your defenses become you, now you become them  
It's one night on the weekend  
Then you're gone again  
  
Well I'm tears and I'm passion and there's a woman in me  
Stop all your runnin' and I'll set you free  
And I stand before you naked, and my soul is on my sleeve  
And the last time you loved was the first time you ever cried  
  
It was the first time you ever really loved  
And it's the last time you ever tried  
It was the first time you ever really loved  
Say it's not the last time you'll ever try

Spinning on another wheel  
Going round in slow motion  
Caught up in another dream  
Drifting on a blue ocean  
When you gonna reach out  
Only you can turn your world around  
When will you surrender  
And wake up to the real  
But you don't want to start just yet  
You watch the seasons come and go  
You remember and then you forget  
All along the way  
You can make a better life  
You're just waiting for the right moment  
You can find another way  
You're just waiting for the right moment  
When you gonna let go  
And forget about the life you knew  
When will you surrender  
And wake up to the real  
Now you know that it's all borrowed time  
Still you waste another day  
But you watch and you wait for a sign  
All along the way

This is the last time  
I'll look across this table  
And try to face a feeling I don't even recognize  
This is a sad hand  
That reached across and touched you  
When all we'd built around us came crashing to the ground  
  
There was a tide turning  
Somewhere deep inside us  
When all these years together seem lost behind my tears  
Oh there were good times  
But in between the dog days  
I felt the pain of rumour whisper in my ears  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you can't fight the rumour  
You can't argue with you heart, no  
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past  
  
As the rain falls  
I listen to the radio  
And try to memorize the words to "Georgia On My Mind"  
But we're no old song  
We never stood the test of time  
The lies inside the rumour left trust so far behind  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you can't fight the rumour  
You can't argue with you heart, no  
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past  
  
And when we say goodbye  
Be sure to look me in the eye  
And know the real secret  
Was the thing we didn't have to hide  
  
But I still tried to love you  
I still tried to care  
Still tried to hold on with the power of my prayers  
But you can't fight the rumour  
You can't argue with you heart, no  
Once the rumour spreads, once the rumour spreads  
Once the rumour spreads, the truth is just a thing of the past  
Once the rumour spreads,

You ask me how much I need you  
Must I explain  
I need you oh my darling  
Like roses need rain  
  
You ask how long I'll love you  
I'll tell you true  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
I'll still be loving you  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold me close  
Never let me go  
Hold me close  
Melt my heart like April snow  
  
I'll love you 'til the bluebells  
Forget to bloom  
I'll love you 'til the clover  
Has lost its perfume  
  
And I'll love you 'til the poets  
Run out of rhyme  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And that's a long, long time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll love you 'til the bluebells  
Forget to bloom  
I'll love you 'til the clover  
Has lost its perfume  
  
And I'll love you 'til the poets  
Run out of rhyme  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And that's a long, long time  
  
Until the Twelfth of Never  
And that's a long, long time  
A long, long time

Someday when I'm awfully low  
When the world is cold  
I will feel a glow just thinking of you  
And the way you look tonight  
Oh but you're lovely  
With your smile so warm  
And your cheek so soft  
There is nothing for me but to love you  
Just the way you look tonight  
With each word my tenderness grows  
Tearing my fear apart  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose  
Touches my foolish heart  
Lovely, never, never change  
Keep that breathless charm  
Won't you please arrange it cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight

I want you  
But takin' it easy ain't an easy thing to do  
And I want you, want you  
You must know  
Cause baby I can't begin to keep it in  
Our love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
Our love is totally hot  
I'm burnin' up  
And if my mama could read my mind she'd lock me up  
And I'm burnin', burnin'  
You must know  
Cause baby when you're around I come unwound  
Our love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
Out love is totally hot  
Play the game and let me do the same  
And we gonna get along, gonna get along, gonna get along fine  
Watchin' out for my heart  
But when I am near you  
Near you ain't the place to start, no, no, no, no  
Takin' it slow  
Whenever I cross your trail, my brakes just fail  
My love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
My love is totally hot  
My love is so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Baby, baby, so hot, totally hot  
You got to me  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
My love is totally hot  
Gimme what you got, ready or not  
My love is totally, totally, totally hot  
(repeats)  
  

He's the kind that takes the line of least resistance  
In this situation cupid needs assistance

You should learn a little self-defense  
  
Toughen up

Toughen up  
You're gonna need to

Don't let him get the best of you  
Toughen up, yeah

If you love him take a tip from me  
It's a sensible philosophy

Toughen up, yeah  
Toughen up  
Enough is enough  
  
Toughen up  
Show him you're hot stuff  
Toughen up  
Don't let him get one over you  
  
Toughen up, yeah

(Olivia Newton-John)  
I need to tell the truth  
I can't lie anymore  
I need to do what's right  
I know that's what my life is for  
I can't be quiet anymore  
About what I'm suppose to do  
I need to tell the truth  
And do what's right by you  
I need to speak my mind  
And let my heart run free  
Your pain will heal with time  
And one day you'll thank me  
And as I follow my dream  
And there is no room for you  
Just know there was no scheme  
It's just what I had to do  
Trust yourself--you know all the answers  
Trust yourself--you know what is right  
Trust yourself--they're all there inside you  
They've been there forever--just show them some light  
Sometimes the truth brings pain  
But broken dreams regrow  
Not in the same old way  
But change is life you know  
And as I move on  
To start my song anew  
Please understand my need  
To do what I have to do  
Trust yourself--you know all the answers  
Trust yourself--you know what is right  
Trust yourself--they're all there inside you  
They've been there forever--just show them some light  
And as life goes on  
Can we still be friends?  
Don't let this circumstance  
Cause our friendship to end  
Trust yourself--you know all the answers  
Trust yourself--you know what is right  
Trust yourself--they're all there inside you  
They've been there forever--just show them some light  
I need to tell you the truth  
I need to speak my mind  
Sometimes the truth brings pain  
Your pain will heal in time
