So he finally called  
I waited so long and he finally called  
To tell me him and his ex-girlfriend  
They gonna work it out  
  
I went to make a withdrawl  
Make a withdrawl at an ATM  
I sat and watched my card go in  
But it didn't come out  
  
It's one of them days  
Where you just shake your head and smile  
And know that God has a sense of humor  
He's laughin' at me right now  
  
So I'm gonna turn off my tv  
Just let it watch me  
With my head under the sheets  
I spend this whole damn day asleep (whole damn day asleep)  
Said I'm turnin' off my phone  
Tell the world to leave to alone  
Gonna stay right here in bed  
All day long  
  
I said, all day long  
Hey, all day long  
I'm talkin', all day long  
All day long  
  
Yeah  
I'm takin' off these clothes  
So I can throw on a big t-shirt  
The one that he thought he lost (that he thought he lost)  
I had it all along (not giving it back)  
And I ain't taking no calls (nooo)  
Acceptin' no calls (nooo)  
Not even from work (nooo)  
(Nooo) Today I'm my own boss  
And I gave myself the day off  
  
Hey  
Cause it's one of them days  
Where you just shake your head and smile  
I know that God has a sense of humor  
I'm laughin' with him right now (laughin' with him right now)  
  
Cause I turned off my tv  
Just let it watch me  
With my head under the sheets  
I spend this whole damn day asleep (whole damn day asleep)  
Said I'm turnin' off my phone  
Tell the world to leave to alone  
Gonna stay right here in bed (hey)  
All day long  
  
Hey-ey-ey  
Said the world ain't on my side today  
Honestly that's a-ok with me  
It's rainin' anyway  
There ain't no need to go outside  
I tell you that the only firends I need today  
Is my blanket and my pillowcase with me (hey)  
And I'm alright  
  
Gonna turn off my tv  
Just let it watch me  
With my head under the sheets  
I spend this whole damn day asleep (whole damn day asleep)  
Said I'm turnin' off my phone  
Tell the world to leave to alone

All day long

All day long

All day long  
Oooooo, Whoaaa

The car that I drive, may not impress  
But I get where I need to go  
You may disagree, with the way that I dress (oooh)  
But I'm always comfortable  
My fortune and fame,  
Ain't no display, nobody has stick to myself  
And to be perfectly honest,  
I like it that way  
So it doesn't matter what you say  
I may not be who you want me to be  
All I can be is me  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave  
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
'Cause all I can be is me  
(Ohhh, yeah, yeah)  
Sometimes I prefer to just stay at home  
Don't need that fancy restaurant  
Sometimes I would rather turn the tv on,  
Simple is all I want  
Why put on a mask?  
Why be all a vision?  
There's never a reason  
I'm happy with me,  
My life's not in mission  
I'm ok with who I'm bein'  
Though I may not be who you want me to be  
But all I can be is me  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave  
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
Said all I can be is me  
What you get is what you see  
'Cause all I can be is me  
(Ooohh)  
Money, cars, and diamond rings  
All those expensive things  
Baby I just don't give a damn  
But if you really love me,  
Like you say you'd love me  
Then baby take me as I am  
(Heeeey)  
Though I may not be who you want me to be.  
But all I can be is me.  
I won't pretend,  
So baby take it or leave. (hey)  
'Cause all I can be is me (all I can be, all I can be)  
All I can be is me. (all I can be, all I can be)  
Said all I can be is me.  
What you get is what you see  
'Cause all I can be is me

[Verse 1:]  
Nights full of fears, eyes full of tears  
Cus you been hearin the same lies for 5 years.  
Fresh out of high school he pursued his career  
And you played the house wife roll for dude and his kids  
But now you can't get a break no matter how hard you try,  
Your life's on the line everytime you start up the ride  
Cus you never got ur L's but its hard not to drive  
When ur baby got a cold and the car is outside  
Plus the hospital is far and ur dude ran out on ya  
Just because he said that you had a mouth on ya,  
Becus you would scream and holla  
When he walk up in the room with maybeline up on his collar  
And he didn't even bother to consider his child  
He said he'd always be around but what's so different now?  
You stressin now cause you can figure it out  
But keep ur head in the clouds girl  
Continue to smile girl  
Cus baby you are a  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly  
Black angel  
  
[Verse 2:]  
He swept you off your feet when you met it was love at first sight  
He didn't even curse, said he was the Church type  
Was almost Mr. Right until ur first fight  
And you found out he was worse than ike  
Cus he hit you in the face so hard that I hurt to bite  
Now your uncertain of this person you liked  
But you keep making excuses for him being abusive  
Cause you want it to work this time  
So you convince your mind that it fine  
But in time your gonna find  
That real love aint defined with violence  
And if you're crying every night  
Just cause some guy decided its ahhite  
To hit you in the eye then its time  
That you learn from the mistakes  
Of those that chose to stay  
Cause most of em are gone today  
And there's a gang of sistas  
That would probably still be with us  
If they would've just flown away Ne-yo gone and sang  
  
[Chorus x 2:]  
(you're fly)  
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly  
Black angel  
  
[Bridge:]  
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love  
And start depending on the man above  
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love  
And start depending on the man above  
Babygirl stop depending on your man for love  
And start depending on the man above  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black angel, Oh baby you are so fly  
Black angel. Girl don't let him hold you down  
Get up and just spread your wings and fly  
Black angel

Floating along in the middle of the sea  
That's what it feels like  
Two weeks later and you're still not talking to me  
We could be using that to make up  
But lately you don't even seem to care  
So let me try this again  
I'm sorry for the wrong that I've did  
Why can't we just get over it  
  
This ain't right  
We're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Stupid fight  
Baby girl we're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Staying made at me for eternity  
What's that gonna fix  
So baby can we try  
Cause what we've got is so much bigger than this  
  
Now baby normally we don't stay mad for too long  
We would break up just to make up cause it felt long  
Girl I miss you intensely  
So can we  
It's a love hate kinda thing  
With us baby  
Girl I'm sorry for the wrong that I've did  
Why can't we just get over it  
  
This ain't right  
We're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Stupid fight  
Baby girl we're bigger than this  
Bigger than this  
Staying made at me for eternity  
What's that gonna fix  
So baby can we try  
Cause what we've got is so much bigger than this

Cold in this room now  
'Cause you left me  
Here by myself  
Used to make love here  
Now this place feels  
Like a prison cell  
So many questions  
That we won't answered  
Not today  
(Not today)  
You scream at me  
I scream at you  
And we communicate  
This way  
  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(I think it's safe to say it's over)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(Please don't say it's over)  
  
I want to touch you  
Your body heat to me  
Is Vegas sun  
But I won't give in  
Because if I do  
That means you've won  
Pride is a leash  
I don't know  
What I'm wearing it for  
Why do I do?  
This is a game in which  
Both of us are keeping score  
Still, we both lose  
We're fools  
  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(I think it's safe to say it's over)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(Said please don't say it's over)  
(2x)  
  
Don't say it's over  
Don't say it's over  
Please don't' say it's over  
(Hey, don't say it's over)  
Don't say it's over  
Don't say it's over  
Please don't' say it's over  
(Baby, please  
Don't you say it's over  
Baby please  
Don't say it)  
  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(I think it's safe to say it's over)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up (Oh)  
We're breakin' up  
(Please don't say it's over)  
(X2)

I never said that every choice I made everyone was gonna like.  
I never said that satisfying the masses was how I would live my life.  
I never once did I say all of my decisions would be right.  
I never said I would ignore my heart and listen with just my mind.  
  
Hmm, and I know it looks like I've gone crazy.  
But in the way of love and what it does, I'll be crazy for us.  
  
So call me a fool, call me insane.  
Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
I don't mind, no I don't mind.  
Forget the rules, I'm over the game.  
Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
Then call me ridiculous. Call me ridiculous.  
  
Everyone knows what I'm suppose to do.  
Everybody says I'm out my mind to feel what I feel for you.  
(Feel what I feel for you.)  
Everybody needs to mind their own, to this love I'm not brand new. (Brand  
New)  
Oh, see I know when it's real love, though they think I don't have a clue,  
Oooh I do.  
  
Hmm, and I know it looks like I've gone crazy.  
(I know it looks like I'm crazy.)  
But in the way of love and what it does, I'll be crazy for us.

Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
I don't mind, no I don't mind.  
Forget the rules, I'm over the game.  
Baby yeah loving you the way you do is ridiculous.  
Then call me ridiculous. Call me ridiculous.  
  
For seeing something inside of you that no one else can see.  
That's why they don't understand me, no.  
It's so stupid. (Stupid) Idiot, blind to it.  
Say what will I don't mind, baby that's what it'll be.  
(That's what it'll be.) Long as it's always "we".  
Ridiculous that's me. Oh whoa oh, ridiculous that's me.  
Oh whoa whoa whoa whoa oh.  
  
So call me a fool, call me insane.  
Tell me that loving you the way you do is ridiculous.

Suddenly the nights about to end

But you the flyest thing I've seen, yeah  
Since I came up in here, you're a superstar, my dear  
I don't wanna waste your time  
With no corny player lines (corny player lines)  
But, girl, if you don't mind  
I would love to occupy the space right by your side  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, can we chill?  
Talk about leavin' together, sure, we will  
But, just for now, don't let my champagne spill on you  
As you make your move to the floor, floor, floor, floor  
Girl, can we chill?  
Talk about leavin' together, sure, we will (sure, we will)  
Later I'll do everything you want me to  
Makin' love to you  
Beg for more, more, more, more  
  
Shawty speakin' honestly (speakin' honestly)  
I can picture you and me (picture you and me)  
Bein' ever so discreet (ever so discreet)  
Disappearin' to the back of this club, imagine that, baby  
(Don't get mad at me  
No, baby girl, I was just playin')  
Hey, unless you really wanna go  
You're in control, just let me know  
But right now my song is playin'  
Let's take it to the floor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge:]  
(Ooo, don't wanna rush  
Let's take it slow)  
Enjoy the night, babe  
Then you decide if you want to  
(Get to know me on a physical side)  
(Baby, tonight) Oh, baby, tonight  
(Let's get right) Let's get it right  
  
[Chorus]

Verse 1:  
Put your pictures away,  
Anything that might bring up,  
Memories of the days and the nights we spent in love,  
You were my favorite song,  
Baby tell me why we had to turn the radio off  
  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
You hardly ever even cross my mind  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
Chorus:  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
  
Verse 2:  
Saw you out yesterday  
And I knew that you saw me  
You was with your new man  
And I was with some random peeps  
Suddenly we caught eyes  
And I looked away before it got too hard to breathe  
  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
You hardly ever even cross my mind  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
Chorus (2x):  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
Girl I aint tripping on you  
I'm just fine  
I don't even think about you babe  
Even though a blind man could look in my face and just know that that's a lie  
I'm barely treading water saying I'm alright  
  
'cause I can't stop crying  
And I can't stop asking why  
But I can't stop lying  
And if you ask me I'll deny  
That I can't stop crying  
On the outside I'm alright  
But I'm dying on the inside  
  
I'm dying...  
Girl you're killing me...  
Dying on the inside...  
Dying on the inside...  
Killing me, killing me babe

Closer  
Closer  
Closer  
Closer  
  
Turn the lights off in this place  
And she shines just like a star  
And I swear I know her face  
I just don't know who you are  
Turn the music up in here  
I still hear her loud and clear  
Like she's right there in my ear  
Telling me  
That she wants to own me  
To control me  
Come closer  
Come closer  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh I just can't pull myself away  
Under her spell I can't break  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
And I just can't break myself no way  
But I don't want to escape  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
  
I can feel her on my skin  
I can taste her on my tongue  
She's the sweetest taste of sin  
The more I get the more I want  
She wants to own me  
Come closer  
She says "come closer"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x7]  
(Come closer)  
  
[Repeat: x4]  
I just can't stop no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh I just can't pull myself away  
Under her spell I can't break  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
I just can't stop  
Come closer

[Intro]  
I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
  
[Verse 1]  
Girl, I'm watching you  
Loving the way you controlling the scene  
Sexy attitude, talk like you walking  
Your walk is so mean  
They want to hate you  
Hate on you good  
Cause you so damn bad  
I don't condone but I understand it  
Cause it just ain't no fair  
That you look like that  
I'm on it  
  
[Chorus]  
Got me saying  
Where you going? What you getting into?  
I'm coming with you  
Said if it's all good baby girl I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
Cause I'm on you tough  
And I wanna make that move  
I'm coming with you  
I said if it's all good baby girl I'm coming with you  
I'm coming with you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Baby, pardon me  
If I may come across kind of direct  
My bad baby  
But I been the type to go for what I want  
And I ain't never been checked, no  
But I might let you try  
Girl, what's the business  
I'mma let you decide  
Where it is we go  
Yeah, show me the way you ball so baby  
Sexy to me way you take control  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
We can go anywhere  
Just pick a star and let me take you there  
Baby girl it's you that I want  
And all I know is I'm not leaving here alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Outro]  
I'm coming with you, baby  
I'm coming with you, baby  
I'm coming with you, baby  
I'm coming with you, girl

So after this song  
You gon' love me for my honesty  
Or you gon' hate me for being me  
Yeah, I'm sayin'  
One of the two is gonna happen  
With all that I can be  
Is what I am and who I am  
  
Chasing women when I should be recording  
Invite a couple then I invite some more  
Next thing you know it's 3 in the morning  
And I've only done one song  
20k on champagne in the club  
Then 20k more just because  
That's 40k in 3 hours  
But everybody watching my section  
So it's alright babe,  
I know it may sound silly to you  
Truthfully it's silly to me too  
But that's what makes this song so true  
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time  
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying  
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine  
Especially if your shine is outshining mine  
I wanna be faithful but I keep running in the dimes  
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right  
The image I portray making people judge a book  
But if they really took the time to look  
  
Then they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
So they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
  
I ain't got a condom here  
(Oh no)  
Too lazy to run to the store  
(And it's cold outside)  
But you just met her 3 hours ago  
Says the angel on my shoulder  
See but the devil he could talk real loud  
And on my decision I'm not proud  
But by the grace of God I'm here right now  
Help being good and older  
So it's alright  
I know it may sound reckless to you  
Truthfully it's reckless to me too  
But that's what makes this song so true  
I'm a little irresponsible most of the time  
I'm a man of my word but only when I ain't lying  
I say I'm not a hater but I hate to see you shine  
Especially if your shine is outshining mine  
I wanna be thankful but I keep running into dimes  
And they make it so easy so it's hard to do right  
The image I portray making people judge a book  
But if they really took the time to look  
  
Then they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
They will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
  
Oh I do alot of stupid shit  
Hoping I never have to pay for rent  
It's like I become rather an idiot  
Every extra million I get  
I thank God for my family and my crew  
'Cause I can be alot to put up with  
Much love to my people that don't mind  
The cracks in Mr. Perfect  
  
So they will see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah yeah  
You can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
Said you can see the cracks in Mr. Perfect  
Yeah  
  
And in the end they all learned a valuable lesson  
Perfection is just glorified opinion  
When in the grand scheming things it's our imperfections  
That truly make us perfect  
So do yourself a favor  
Find the beauty in your cracks

We're a hurricane  
So destructive in the way that we do  
A little bit insane  
But she loves it just the same  
And me too  
  
They say love and insanity  
Are somewhat related  
The way that they make us act  
But baby girl the love between you and me, oh  
Is truly the greatest  
Though sometimes we hate it  
  
They can't tell me nothing about no you  
You're my  
Crazy love  
Can't tell me nothing about how we do  
'Cause we got  
Crazy love, oh yeah  
  
I'm intelligent  
I'm not stupid  
Not at all, no, no, no  
But my common sense  
When it comes to you it falls  
Then I do something dumb  
  
They say love and insanity  
Are somewhat related  
In the way that they make us act  
But baby girl the love between you and me  
Is truly the greatest  
Though sometimes we hate it  
  
They can't tell me nothing about no you  
You're my  
Crazy love  
Can't tell me nothing about how we do  
You and me got  
Crazy love, oh yeah  
  
I walk into where you was at then my phone calls get a who is that  
I told her that I worry that we won't last  
She told me you need to worry when I don't ask  
See that's the crazy love I be talking bout  
Gary Coleman face girl what you talking bout  
Make me wanna kick you and that yorkie out  
Then I see that fat ass when you walking out  
How I'm gonna tell my baby bye-bye  
Outfit look crazy on her you my lady gaga  
But you wanna start it first and get the last word  
You wanna lock me down and get the password  
Damn I wanna spray don't use juice  
So in the bedroom I got a few screws loose  
The head's coo-coo back-shots psycho  
Hit it from the back hard hope you got Geico  
  
They can't tell me nothing about no you  
You're my  
Crazy love  
Can't tell me nothing about how we do  
You and me got  
Crazy love, oh yeah

We might luck up and get sunshine  
It's what you deserve, the sound of the birds  
And your hair flying free in the wind girl  
So go on girl, you're the only flower that blooms in the summer  
Ain't no need to stop and wonder  
'Cause there'll never be another  
That's how I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(smile)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(touch)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
Feeling that you give, girl I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your hair)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your skin)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(eyes)  
  
We got perfect timing, our hearts are often broken  
But mine's you keep so wide open  
We both know there's no guarantee, yeah  
  
So baby, you see you gotta tell me where you came from  
'Cause if you leave someone's gotta replace ya  
'Cause I realize that you are truly something special  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(smile)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(touch)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
Feeling that you give, girl I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your hair, baby)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(skin)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(eyes)

Feeling that you give, girl I know  
  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your hair)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(your skin)  
They don't make 'em like you no more  
(eyes)  
  
Oh, oh, baby  
They don't, they don't  
Make 'em like you

Don't wanna know you  
Don't wanna know your name  
Said I don't wanna call you  
Don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna like you  
I don't care if you like me  
Said and if you haven't caught on yet  
I'm lying through my teeth  
  
See the problem is the more I fight it  
The harder it gets to deny it  
And everything in me wants to be with you  
But I've seen where love can leave you devastated  
So everyday I look in the mirror and I say this  
  
I tell my self I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
Said I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know just what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I don't wanna be in love  
  
Don't wanna love when you walk in the room  
Don't wanna love everything to the click clack of your shoes  
Don't wanna love when you put on sweats in the afternoon  
And you curl up next to me as we watch cartoons  
  
Said I don't wanna be  
I tell myself I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
SaiD I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I don't wanna be in love  
  
Wish I didn't love the way you smile at me  
And the sun shines  
Wish we could live happily ever after but girl I'm terrified  
Even though it feels so right  
  
I tell myself I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
Said I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know just what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
I don't wanna be in love  
  
I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
Said I don't wanna be, I don't wanna be in love  
'Cause I know what it is and I know what it does  
So I don't wanna be in love  
Right now it was too much  
So I don't wanna be in love  
  
So now I don't wanna be in love,  
Right now is just too much,  
So I don't wanna be in love...

There's no problem that I can't solve,  
In a test of our love,  
If your love was multiple choice,  
You'd be all of the above,  
You're the answer to all my questions,  
No need to cheat,  
Together we're the perfect score,  
You make me complete,  
I never seen a woman,  
With so much beauty and class,  
My heart was always a failure,  
Til you helped me pass,  
I wanna give you my all now,  
No more excuses,  
Cause without you in my life,  
My life is so,  
Useless,  
  
[Chorus]  
I played every game in the book,  
But you changed my perspective,  
And for the first time,  
Love, my only objective,  
Moments can be feelings,  
Things aren't always what they seem,  
Baby if I'm sleeping,  
Please don't wake me from this dream,  
[Verse 2]  
Your heart and I enganged,  
In a game of hide and seek,  
Since our very first encounter,  
I was playing finders keep,  
No need to look any further,  
Already found my soulmate,  
Although it took a little while,  
Baby you were the whole way,  
Baby can't you understand,  
That I wanna put a ring on your hand,  
Baby I can't say I'm perfect,  
We both know I'm not,  
But I think it's about time that we tie the knot,  
Cuz I've played every game,  
[Chorus]  
I played every game in the book,  
But you changed my perspective,  
And for the first time,  
Love, my only objective,  
Moments can be feelings,  
Things aren't always what they seem,  
Baby if I'm sleeping,  
Please don't wake me from this dream,  
Don't wake me from this dream,  
  
[Verse 3]  
Baby you're the one that makes me whole,  
But while you're warming up my soul,  
At the same time,  
You're breaking my heart,  
I knew we would fall in love from the start  
[Chorus]  
I played every game in the book,  
But you changed my perspective,  
And for the first time,  
Love, my only objective,  
Moments can be feelings,  
Things aren't always what they seem,  
Baby if I'm sleeping,  
Please don't wake me from this dream,  
Don't wake me from this dream,

My guitar is jealous of our relationship  
Cause' she don't get half the attention that you get  
Lately, I don't know how it happened  
But it did  
And now, baby now  
All I ever seem to want is...  
  
(CHORUS)  
A kiss, a hug, some sort of affection  
Ooh I need it  
You've become my crutch, a drug  
You're my new addiction  
Gimme my fix, ooh your love is  
(Drugz)Ooh your touch is  
(Drugz)Ooh your kiss is  
(Drugz)Baby you are  
(Drugz)Oooh you're just like drugz  
  
I am not what you would call a crazy chick  
But you've got me on, some of that crazy  
Shiverin...  
Like i'm cold when it's nice and warm  
Sittin' by the phone  
Waiting for you to call  
Cause' it be callin me  
Baby all I need is...  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
I, I, I, I  
Really need a fix

(CHORUS)  
  
Oooh I need it

You are my fix, ooooh your love is

You See It All In My Smile  
You Hear It All In My Laugh  
The Way I Walk  
You Hear Me Talkin,  
No, I'm No Longer Sad  
I've Got More Reason To Smile  
More Now Than I've Ever Had  
Open My Eyes And Realized  
That Nothing's Quite That Bad  
  
I've Got A Different Approach  
Of Dealin With Emotion  
Keeping Control Of My Boat  
While Drifting On This Ocean  
Keeping My Head To The Sky  
Keeping Tears Outta My Eyes  
Girl, This Happiness Be The Reason  
That I Just Haven't Cried  
  
And Life's Too Short  
To Dwell On All That's Wrong  
Stand Up Now  
Stand Up Now,  
And I Promise Not Before Long  
Cuz You'll Be Feeling Better Today  
Much Better Today,  
Much Better Today  
So Much Better  
Feelin Better Today...

Feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
  
Would be beyond understatement to  
To simply say that I miss you  
And the sky outside is blue  
But my mind inside is too  
  
Don't think about it  
I only think about it  
When gets old  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
God never makes mistakes I know  
So there's a reason you had to go  
There's a reason for no more lies  
I just wish I knew what it was  
  
Don't think about it  
I only think about it  
When gets old  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
And don't think about it, no  
Suffer when the wind blows  
Don't think about it  
Suffer every time my heart goes  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
  
When the sun goes down  
And the moon comes up  
And the stars come out  
I can feel you all over  
(Feel you all over)  
All over  
(Feel you all over)  
Feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
  
Every time I breathe  
Air into my lungs  
I can close my eyes  
And feel you all over  
Feel you all over  
Feel you all over me  
(Feel you all over)

Oh, oh, oh  
She don't impress me, not like she used to  
Everything that she don't do  
That's what I want, what I need  
Seeking rapidly, that's when you sailed through  
That's mean so way with you  
Everything that she won't do, you do for me  
  
Say what you say, we're floating away, away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldn't see tomorrow today, then you came  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that I'll be ok, since you came, yeah  
  
12 am she leaves, she don't say where to  
Won't see her again till 12 noon and she don't smile like me  
Suddenly I see why she don't do what she used to  
She found someone new, well baby me too, so sorry  
  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldn't see tomorrow today, then you came, oh  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, way  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that I'll be ok, since you came  
  
Ohohoh...  
  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Baby I was downing in my sorrow  
Couldn't see tomorrow today, then you came  
Say what you say, say, say, we're floating away, away, away  
Now I see the sun on the horizon  
Now I think that I'll be ok, since you came  
  
Say what you say, oh, oh  
Say what you say, aaahh  
Say what you say

Verse 1:  
Stop me before I do something dumb  
Like fall in love with you(ooh)  
You kiss me once and I stand there stunned  
I don't wanna break loose, baby  
Never wanna break loose, baby  
I'd be a fool to think I was the only one  
I know you've got a few  
So I try not to involve my emotions  
It's just no use baby  
Everything that you do makes me  
Just want you more  
  
Chorus:  
Baby, when I look at you  
I just want you more  
When you touch me like you do  
I just want some more  
Baby, baby you're forbidden fruit  
And the fact that I can't have ya  
Just makes me want you more  
  
Verse 2:  
You are temptation in everyway  
You smile at me and (ooh)  
When your around  
I just can't behave  
I don't wanna break loose, baby  
But I know I need to, baby  
  
I'd be a fool to think I was the only one  
I know you've got a few  
So I try not to involve my emotions  
It's just no use baby  
Everything that you do makes me  
Just want you more  
  
Chorus:  
Baby, when I look at you  
I just want you more  
When you touch me like you do  
I just want some more  
Baby, baby you're forbidden fruit  
And the fact that I can't have ya  
Just makes me want you more  
  
And the saddest part of this  
I know that you are no good for me(know you are no good for me)  
But I just can't resist  
Baby what you do  
Baby you're forbidden fruit  
Chorus

Was gonna give you these flowers tonight  
Was gonna ask you to stay  
Practiced so that I would say it just right  
But now there are no words to say  
  
As I watch you kiss him softly  
The same way you kissed me  
  
I scream what am I gonna do with forever now?  
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now? Ohh  
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around  
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?  
What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
  
In slow motion I let these flowers hit the ground  
And right before I turn to leave  
  
I watch you kiss him softly  
Then look up and see me  
  
And I scream, "What am I gonna do with forever now?" Wow  
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?  
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around  
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now?  
What do I do now?  
  
Everything you said we would be  
All the things you said we'd do  
I made all my life around the thought of me and you  
  
And I scream "What am I gonna do with forever now?" (What do I do? What do I
do now?)Wow  
Tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now? (What do I do? What do I do
now?) Ohh  
All the plans we made don't work if you're not around  
So tell me, what am I gonna do with forever now? Ey  
What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
  
What do I do? What do I do now?  
What do I do now?  
What do I do? What do I do now?  
What do I do now?

Oh, oh  
Oh, I can't get it back  
But I don't want it back  
I realized that she  
Don't know how to act  
Never been a dumb dude  
No, I'm not dense  
I just had a slight lack of common sense  
I was the good guy  
She was the bad girl  
I'm thinking one girl  
She thinking me, Earl, James, and Jimmy  
Yep, she had plenty  
But love for me, she didn't have any  
  
[Bridge:]  
I was inviting (her into my heart)  
But she was out riding (in some other man's car)  
She was my night time, (thought I was her star)  
Guess I was wrong, but, see, I'm strong  
Won't take me long for me to move on  
  
[Chorus:]  
Please, don't worry 'bout me, I'm fine  
(Please, don't worry 'bout me, I'm fine)  
Only gonna play the fool one time  
(Only gonna play the fool one time)  
Trust me when I say that I'll be okay  
Go on, girl  
(Go on, girl)  
Go on, girl  
(Go on, girl)  
Go on, girl  
  
I can't get it back  
But I don't want it back  
I realized that she  
Don't know how to act  
Tried to settle down and look what I get  
Thought it was my time, but I guess not yet  
She at the bar getting drinks from many men  
I'm in the house, thinking she's with her girlfriends  
Just not knowing, truly not knowing  
I look back now like, man, I was open  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooo, the mistake I made was clear  
(We never should've been together)  
That's the reason you're not here  
(I know that I can do much better)  
Not a single salty tear  
Not a feeling in my chest  
Baby, I'm feeling no stress  
I'm too fly to be depressed  
  
Go on, girl, go on, girl  
Go on, girl, go on, girl  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Go on, girl, go on, girl, go on, girl  
I'll be fine

[Intro]Uh (uh uh uh)  
Na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na  
  
[Verse 1]Ain't that a damn shame?  
Your last thing may change, change  
I gotta get to your virgo  
Just say your off the chain  
Off the room, I know you wanted fame  
Houston, we got a problem, man  
I can fix this like we're in plan  
I still sip crystal, I follow no trends,  
Beyond words, that's beyond thoughts  
I just say it huh, it's my fault, my bad I needa ask microsoft  
Computer love, ya brought and she rockin that - pause  
Smell like livin at least I'm not a jinx  
Cause I gotta good feeling  
Gotta get you girl cause she might got willing  
My dream Gurl!  
  
[Chorus]So, I gotta get ya!  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya

Na na na na na na  
I can't (I can't) let you get away  
  
[Verse 2]Oh, Oh Canada, Oh Canada!  
I notice my cookies don't crumble  
What's up, it's got me on from Toronto  
My favourite bond on the stereo  
You know it, is fallin  
Pop broad, our first day in New York  
Pardon, Gees how we shoulda may cause  
Sad look like shoulda play sports  
Deserve double lubba tons I bought  
I prayed, ever meet again, to the lord  
But then I ran out, just wanna respect  
Not a hand down, not one for the jealousy  
I'm a man now, eleven seven seven six, that's what I'm talkin bout,  
So random, hit the athem  
Don't let it be as spread like cancer,  
Reminiscing red carpet for the cameras  
So famous!  
  
[Chorus]So I Gotta get ya!  
  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, sing it to me now  
  
Na na na na na na  
I can't (I can't) let you get away  
Na na na na na na  
I can't (I can't) let you get away  
  
[Verse 3]Girl, your body keeps calling me  
I'm feelin you energy  
Na na na na na na  
I know, I won't forgive myself  
If you end up with someone else, yea  
Na na na na na na  
I just wanna let you know,  
I'm not gonna let you go (let you go, let you gooo)  
  
[Chorus 2]Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya  
  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya  
  
Hey, I can't let you get away from me  
I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, I gotta get ya

I can't let you get away from me  
Hey, sing it to me now  
  
Na na na na na na

Na na na na na na  
I can't (I can't) let you get away  
  
Na na na na na na  
I can't (I can't) let you get away  
  
[Outro]Can't let you get away  
Can't let you get away  
Can't let you get away  
Can't let you get away

That's how much I love you  
That's how much I need you  
And I can't stand you  
Must everything you do make me wanna smile  
Can I not like you for awhile? (No)  
  
But you won't let me  
You upset me, girl  
And then you kiss my lips  
All of a sudden I forget (that I was upset)  
Can't remember what you did  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly what to do  
So that I can't stay mad at you  
For too long, that's wrong  
  
(But I hate it) You know exactly how to touch  
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more  
Said I despise that I adore you  
  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (yeah)  
I can't stand how much I need you (I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy (ooh, whoa)  
But I just can't let you go  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And you completely know the power that you have (the power that you have)  
The only one makes me laugh (one that makes you laugh)  
  
Sad, and it's not fair  
How you take advantage of the fact  
That I love you beyond a reason why  
And it just ain't right  
  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
I can't stand how much I need you (yeah)  
And I hate how much I love you, girl  
But I just can't let you go  
But I hate that I love you so  
  
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me  
And your kiss won't make me weak  
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me  
So you'll probably always have a spell on me  
Yeah, oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
That's how much I love you (how much I need you)  
That's how much I need you (how much I love you)  
That's how much I love you (Oh, need you)  
That's how much I need you (I need you)  
  
And I hate that I love you so  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
I can't stand how much I need ya (I can't stand how much I need you)  
And I hate how much I love you, boy  
But I just can't let you go (but I just can't let you go, no)  
And I hate that I love you so (ooh)  
  
And I hate that I love you so, so

Rock his jewels like they're mine, don't care if they're stolen  
Crept up real close and this is what I told him

On the ground and come out them shoes

Get up with what little you've got and get out of here  
Before you gone flip, the keys to the whip

Shit  
  
(Let me hold you up)  
  
[6 John]  
  
Cuz I don't give a damn nigga damn you  
I don't care about the sentimental value  
Passed on generation to generation  
Grandma's old box of wild jewels  
I got a grandma too  
Her diamonds blue  
But yours is so blue  
Here lets make yours hers and  
(Let me hold you up)  
Like you at attention  
And give me gat attention  
And if there's anything you failed to mention I've got bad intentions  
You don't want to end up missing with a stint  
You'd rather hand your riches  
That's the smart thing to do  
  
(Let me hold you up)  
  
[Chorus: Ne-Yo]  
  
On your arm on your neck on your wrist I want it  
Yeah that's right, all your ice and your cash, I want it  
Hold you up and nigga I ain't trynna front with you

Let me hold you up

December's  
Rollin' around  
And it's nice  
And cold outside  
It's been  
A little while since  
I last saw your face  
  
Except for on the TV  
And I'm so proud of you  
You're doing so good  
And I'm not trying  
To stress you  
But it'd be nice  
To give you a hug  
If I could  
  
Chorus:  
I think you know that  
Nobody likes to be alone  
On Christmas time  
Christmas time is here  
And all  
I really want is you  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home  
  
The tree is set up  
In the corner  
I decorated it myself  
I sent you a picture  
Think I did pretty good  
  
And your grandma told me  
She's gonna make her  
Sweet potato pie  
And your mother had gifts  
She wanted  
To bring to the house  
Wanted to know  
If she should  
  
I told her  
I was not sure  
If you were going  
To be around  
She sounded kinda sad  
But she said  
"She would come on down  
To be with me  
And the baby"  
  
Think you know  
  
(Chorus)  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home  
  
Would you find  
Your way home?  
Would you find  
Your way  
Cause I need you  
Back here at home  
Cause I need you  
Back here at home  
Find your way home  
  
Did you know that  
Nobody likes to be alone  
On Christmas time  
Christmas time is here  
And all I really want  
Is you  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home  
  
(Chorus)  
  
So  
If you don't mind  
If you don't mind  
Could you  
Think about me  
How much I miss you  
And how long  
You've been gone  
And please  
Find your way home

Somebody told me once, that pain is a game we all gotta play,  
But while am I in overtime... every other day.  
I know that for all the good in life it's a price we all gotta pay,  
But I paid till I poked and I still don't know what it is to have a good day.  
And everybody knows what it is that I need to do,  
Well, do me a favor let me worry about me and you worry about you!  
I don't need no one to put me down,  
I'm on the ground, can't...  
I don't need no one to hack around and make...  
Just makes me look older!  
I don't need no one to block my eyes, and tell me lies

I don't share,  
I'm not that type  
Your list and you,  
Can walk on by  
One of many,  
Not worth my while  
My one and only,  
Now that's my style  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeahhh...  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing "Yeahhh"  
Look him in the eye and tell him,  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
I'm a priceless find  
I'm supposed to be on a pedestal,  
Not standing in line  
Oh no no no  
So make a choice,  
Must decide  
It's them tonight,  
Or me for life  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeahhh...  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing "Yeahhh"  
Look him in the eye and tell him,  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
Hey (x16)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
  
(Chorus)  
Yeahhh...  
If you feel how I feel  
Then sing "Yeahhh"  
Look him in the eye and tell him,  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first, won't come second"  
"I come first or I don't come at all..."  
  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (woahh)  
La La, La La, La La, La La (ohh)  
  
Or I don't come at all...

[Verse:]  
I look away  
When you try to look in my eyes  
Cuz I'm afraid  
That I may scare you with what's inside  
I try not to be so  
Damn obviously overcome  
When you smile at me  
I try not to care that  
You've become the air in my lungs  
That I live to breathe  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid to say  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid  
I love you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Now until then  
I don't care far away it is  
When all I fear  
This love will simply say it's not over again  
I just can't believe how  
Scared I used to be to say  
What you are to me  
I would surely die if  
You were ever to fly away  
Cuz I live to breathe you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid to say  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid  
I love you  
  
[Verse 3:]  
And it feels so good to say it aloud  
I love you  
I love you  
Wherever you go  
Baby you know  
Right here  
And right now  
I love you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid to say  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you  
I'm no longer afraid  
I love you

Say the words, played the part.  
Gave the world and plus my heart.  
Did it all with a smile on my face  
  
Gave you love, mind and soul.  
Thought that it was mutual.  
I see now that that wasn't the case  
  
(Look at me now)  
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me.  
Baby I've grown into a man who knows the deal  
(playn around)  
With my emotions is a thing of the past,sorry.  
Said I become a bit too slick and that's for real.  
  
[Chorus]  
I was in love  
Silly me, silly me.  
I was what you wanted me to be  
But not anymore, not anymore.  
I was in love  
Silly you silly you  
I refuse to be your fool  
Not anymore  
  
Sugar what's with your eyes?  
Why do you look so surprised?  
Is it 'cause your game has no effect?  
( Girl it ain't working )  
And I've developed such a swagger,  
Sharp as a dagger and a mind that just won't fall for it.  
  
(Look at me now)  
Not exactly who I was when you last saw me.  
Baby I've grown into a man who knows the deal  
(playn around)  
My emotions is a thing of the past, sorry.  
Said I become a bit too slick and that's for real.  
Hey!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm glad you thought that  
I'm unhappy without you  
Glad you can see I'm fine hey!  
So what you coming round for baby?  
Girl I don't need you anymore  
  
[Chorus]

There's me,  
Strong in what I believe but at times I try be correct politically  
There's her,  
Hard headed as can be, makes no apologies, the opposite of me  
  
But when it comes to love I'm inspired by her middle finger to the world  
And I love that she don't care how they see us  
And because of her now I don't either  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
And because of her now I won't either  
Now I won't either  
  
There's us,  
Opposite enough to occasionally fuss  
Over things we simply just disagree on  
But there's us,  
Overwhelming trust in the fact that we gon' be us  
Come what may and no matter what  
I learned that from her  
  
But when it comes to love I'm inspired by her middle finger to the world  
And I love that she don't care how they see us  
(How they see us)  
And because of her now I don't either  
(Now I don't either)  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
(Will not let them beat us)  
And because of her now I won't either  
(Now I won't either)  
Now I won't either  
  
She's shown me with, much stronger than  
What they may say, the circumstance  
I'm not ashamed to hold her hand  
Let the cameras flash I don't give a damn  
Oh whoa let the cameras flash I don't give a damn  
Let the cameras flash I don't give a damn  
  
And I love that she don't care how they see us  
(And she don't care how oooh)  
And because of her now I don't either  
(Now I don't either, I don't either)  
And I love that she will not let them beat us  
(Let them beat us)  
And because of her now I won't either  
(And I won't either)  
I won't either no, no

Comin outta my shell and I been doin alright

Girl I'm doin okay

No tears, no tears no more  
I'm done cryin' now  
No pain no pain, said I found another way  
No games, not like before  
Not up here on this cloud  
No time for yesterday,  
Let me explain  
  
I got a new woman,  
Lovin' me in every way that she can,  
All she wanna be is part of my plan,  
Safe to say that I'm in a better way, a better way hey  
  
Got a new woman  
Loves to walk around just holdin' my hand  
Cupid must have found us lovin' like that  
Lovin' this woman  
  
Does anybody understand  
That I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalala  
  
Said I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalalalalalai  
I'm In Love  
  
No stress, no fuss, no fight  
When I'm in her arms  
No time no day no night (no nothin' better no)  
So much more than okay,  
Life is made of this  
No her, no me, no way  
Let me explain  
  
Got a new woman, lovin' me in every way  
That she can, all she wanna be is  
Part of my plan, safe to say that I'm in a better way  
A better way  
  
Got a new woman  
Loves to walk around just holdin' my hand  
Cupid must have found us lovin' like that  
Lovin' this woman  
  
Does anybody understand  
That I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalala  
  
Said I'm in love (love love)  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalalala  
I'm in love  
  
I want the whole damn world to know  
Sure as the wind blows  
Carry the message, far as it can go  
Man I'm in love  
Sometime my way is close  
There's nothin' that can hold back this feeling  
True lovin' in which we're dealin' baby  
I-I-I-I'm in love, I-I-I-I'm in love  
  
Does anybody understand I'm in love  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalala  
  
I'm in love  
And I think I found the real thing (real love)  
Kind of love to make your heart say (love love)  
You got me singin' lalalalalala  
I'm in love  
  
Lalalalala I'm in love

Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door  
  
Starring at your picture, my vision is blur  
My eyes are feeling petite with every word  
They're trying to tell me, I'm only a kid and that I  
Can't be in love, I don't know what it is  
  
And they keep trying to convince me  
That you ain't no good for me  
(You're to young to know, baby, just let it go)  
And they just won't accept what we are  
And what we can be  
(So this letter reads)  
Momma, please understand  
  
Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door  
  
And I know that she thinks that I'm young and naive  
Don't know what's good for me, think of your future  
She says with tears in her eyes  
(Don't throw away your dreams)  
About loving some guy  
  
Momma please, have more faith in me  
You didn't raise a fool, I'm gonna stay by ya side  
Though I know you don't want me to  
So this letter reads  
Momma, please understand  
  
Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door  
  
Nothing I can say to make you feel the way you feel  
But finally I found the love that I know is real, really real  
And I ain't gonna give it up, not for nothing  
I ain't gonna give it up  
(No)  
So momma won't you please understand the way I feel  
Please understand  
  
Momma, I'm sorry  
You know I never meant to hurt you, no  
But I'm in love with the boy next door  
Momma, please understand  
And momma, I'm so sorry  
But I don't think that I can let him go  
I'm in love with the boy next door

[Verse]  
She don't really drink much so she say  
But by the way she was putting in the Malibu Reds away  
She was either 'bout that life  
Tryna front but tryna get right  
Or maybe she work hard, everyday, at her job  
And she feel like she deserve to turn up tonight  
Either way, miss lady bad as a Toblerone sugar rush  
I drew her near, whispered in her ear  
"I think that I'm developing a little crush"  
She said "Nice try, but every short skirt that done walked by has successfully
caught your eye  
No thanks but I'm sure that you're a nice guy"  
Damn, I had no reply, cause she was right  
Newly single so I've been a little thirsty  
She was more than just a booty in a skirt she  
Walked a way I caught up to her in a hurry  
I said "Can I at least know your name before your dead me"  
She turned around and said "My name's integrity"  
Integrity, can you answer this for me  
  
[Hook] (x2)  
Baby where do you wanna go?  
I'll do what you say  
She pointed to the top  
She said take me all the way  
Matter of fact I'll meet you there  
Woah, I fell in love  
  
[Bridge]  
Oh Integrity  
I think that I need you and me babe  
And me babe  
  
[Hook] (x2)  
Baby where do you wanna go?  
I'll do what you say  
She pointed to the top  
She said take me all the way  
Matter of fact I'll meet you there  
Woah, I fell in love  
  
[Outro]  
Integrity, damn

Ne-Yo:  
OK! Bad day got you seeing red  
Wanted to feel the sun on your back  
But it rained on your head instead  
But on the bright side despite this hassle  
Wet sand makes for a better sand castle  
Inhale exhale just take a breath  
And know that things don't always happen like they should  
Gotta learn to roll with the punches and just say it's all good  
  
Cher and Ne-Yo:  
Cause it's like falling down  
When everyone's watching  
In the final round  
Fight your hardest but lose  
It's like shouting out  
But nobody can hear you  
But when it's all said and done  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
  
Cher Lloyd:  
Woke up from the wrong side of the bed  
Gotta get the work done  
And then some got a busy day ahead  
But look on the bright side  
Work hard play harder  
Tomorrow's full of laughter  
Inhale exhale just take a breath  
And know that things don't always happen like they should  
Noooo  
Gotta learn to roll with the punches and just say it's all good  
  
Cher and Ne-Yo:  
Cause it's like falling down  
When everyones watching  
In the final round  
Fight your hardest but lose  
It's like shouting out  
But nobody can hear you  
But when it's all said and done  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
Ooooo  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good  
It's all good  
  
Ne-Yo:  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah  
Yeah Yeah  
Hey  
There'll be bumps in the road  
Things will go out of control  
But you can't let it get you down  
When the right just goes wrong  
Just stop and keep pushing on  
It's all good  
Play it here and now  
  
Cher and Ne-Yo:  
Cause it's like falling down  
When everyones watching  
In the final round  
Fight your hardest but lose  
It's like shouting out  
But nobody can hear you

It's all good  
Ooooo

Ooooo  
It's all good  
It's all good

It's all good

Tired as hell and I can't catch my breath  
Been fighting so long I just aint got nothing left, Are we done?  
Cause I can't take it anymore, I just can't take it  
Been so long since I was close enough to smell your smell  
You're telling me the love is still good, if it is girl I can't tell, Are we
done?  
Cause I can't take it anymore, said I just can't take it  
  
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
We both know this love has died  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
Cause I just can't take it anymore  
  
You say in trippin when I tell you that we've changed  
But your friends, my friends and everybody saying the same thing, Are we done?  
Cause I can't take it anymore, I just can't take it  
I've been noticing the way you get dressed up to go to the store  
And it's right around the corner but you'll be gone for an hour sometimes more  
I ain't the one, and I can't take it anymore, said I just can't take it
anymore  
  
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
We both know this love has died  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
Cause I just can't take it anymore... just can't take it anymore  
  
We can be honest, we have no reason to lie  
Baby we don't have to deny  
Whatever happens we can't say we didn't try  
Nothing for us to do now but say goodbye  
  
Oh girl there ain't no tears to cry  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
We both know this love has died  
I think it's over, I think it's over  
Cause I just can't take it anymore... Cause I just can't take it anymore  
(Repeat 2X)

Holding it tight  
As your body's moving.  
And the way that glass of wine,  
Can ease your mind and soothe ya.  
said ooh baby. I'm gonna do it to ya.  
  
From the wind that blows by  
Smell of a scent of your perfume.  
To the sun that touches your skin  
On a Sunday afternoon.  
I'm jealous!  
  
I said, you got me jealous of everything.  
Everything that gets to know to you. (Baby)  
Said you got me jealous of everything.  
Because nothing loves you like I do.  
I said nothing loves you like I do.  
  
Said I wish my thoughts could be,  
Could be inside your head.  
And make you think of me, and you,  
In your bed.  
Tattoo on your waistline.  
Ooh what I wouldn't do,  
Said what I wouldn't give to be a permanent part of you,  
Oh, oh.  
  
From the wind that blows by  
To the smell of a scent of your perfume.  
To the sun that touches your skin  
On a Sunday afternoon.

And they don't deserve the privilege of lookin' at you girl!  
And I know why,

But baby when it comes to you and I,

Excuse me  
I couldn't help but notice  
You noticing me  
And I was definitely noticing you  
My name is  
You know my name  
But listen  
I have a question  
  
No it ain't like me to drop too hard, no baby  
Or go out of my way to know who you are  
Say you're not one for chasing  
But I'll admit  
Something in you  
Has got my attention girl  
So if I can  
Be a gentleman  
Can I ask your permission girl  
  
[Chorus]  
Said if it's alright with you, baby  
Can I know your name, (oh can I know your name)  
And maybe call you sometime, yeah baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Can I know your name  
  
Looking at you girl I see so much  
So much potential for something better than that  
Like maybe me and you becoming us  
I'm not trying to scare you  
But in your eyes  
I can see why  
People write love songs  
And if God allowed  
I could see how  
I could love you for so long  
First things first  
  
If it's alright with you  
Can I know your name, can I know your name  
And maybe call you sometime, baby, baby  
Can I know your name, (I wanna know, know, know)  
Can I know your name  
Said if it's alright with you  
Can I know your name, (can I know your name), said I wanna know your name  
And maybe call you sometime, baby, baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)

Said I really wanna get to know you  
See what this thing could be, oh

And maybe call you sometime

And maybe call you sometime, baby  
Can I know your name, (wanna know your name)  
Can I know your name, mmm

What I wouldn't give to wrestle over the remote control  
What I wouldn't give to hit you harder than you thought I could with the
pillow  
And we stop just for a second because you got a feather in your eye (eye)  
I get it out and you kiss me I smile and then we get back to our pillow fight  
Now that sounds like fun  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
What I wouldn't give to  
Oh what I wouldn't give to cook you dinner from the microwave  
And what I wouldn't give to burn the popcorn and hear you tell me, "baby
that's okay"  
Baby that's okay  
Then you leave to go to the store and it's almost too much for me  
Though I know it'll only be a minute  
Then you come back through the door with a bag of all the foods that we're not
supposed to eat  
Now tonight that can't be beat  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
What I wouldn't give to  
I want to be in your arms where no harm could ever come my way  
I want to be where you are oh near or far every night and day oh  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice (said I wouldn't notice)  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end (wouldn't bother
us)  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
If the sky begins to fall we wouldn't even notice (wouldn't notice)  
Really wouldn't bother us at all if the world came to an end (world came to an
end)  
Nothing matters but us two, when I'm laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
When I'm laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
Laying around with you  
What I wouldn't give to  
When I'm laying around with you  
No, no, no when I'm laying around with you

I believe that love and trust are one in the same  
I don't think you can truly love somebody unless you trust them  
That blind trust, that beyond a shadow of a doubt  
No matter what this person sayin', that person  
You believe your man  
Now you say you love me  
But every time one of your little friends come at you with something  
We gotta do this  
Mama, I'm tryin, I'm trying to show you that I'm for real  
Tell me what I gotta do to show you that I'm for you  
  
Just shut up and listen  
  
Two hundred and sixteen  
That's how many times that I went  
Back and forth about it in my mind  
Could she, could she really be  
Who he's telling me that she is?  
There's something about it  
That don't feel right  
  
Said, today she called here twenty-six times  
(I know you counted)  
You kept telling me not to worry  
(Don't worry 'bout it)  
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth  
(So don't doubt it)  
But if you are lying to me...  
  
You're leaving tonight  
Out of my life  
Everyone said you ain't no good  
Then you prove them right  
You're leaving tonight  
It's over and done  
Ain't no sense in trying to wait till the morning comes  
(You're leaving tonight)  
  
Baby, now hold up  
Let's just settle down  
'Cause there's a perfect explanation to this situation  
That we're goin' through  
(This thing that we're goin' through)  
I swear I don't know that girl  
But I seen her 'round  
And she's expressed how much she want it  
But, baby, I'm not on that  
All of me is around you, oh  
  
Said, I got a girl like a thousand times  
(So you counted)  
She kept telling me not to worry  
(Don't worry 'bout it)  
Please believe I'm telling the truth  
(I really doubt it)  
Really wish you would believe in me  
  
I'm not leaving tonight  
Girl, you're my life  
All of your friends think I'm no good  
Please, don't prove them right  
I'm not leaving tonight  
It's over and done  
Let's leave this alone, and let's make love  
Till the morning come  
(Not leaving tonight)  
  
Oh, I won't deny  
That everything in my body  
Wants to know that you're the one  
(So, what's the problem, girl?)  
See, I can't take this serious when you're just having fun  
(No, I'm not just having fun)  
Steady running around, making a fool of me, oh!  
(Baby girl, you can't listen to everyone)  
(I'm your man) You're my man (Trust in me)  
(Don't let them interfere with us being happy)  
  
(Love me, girl)  
I love you, that's a fact  
(Say that you love me, baby)  
But I'll be dammed if I'm a let you up and disrespect who's been there from
the start  
You not gon' disrespect my heart  
You claim to not know not know that, girl  
But her name and number is in your phone  
She even got a ring tone  
You care to explain that part?  
  
Said, today she called here twenty-six times  
(I know you counted)  
You kept telling me not to worry  
(Please, don't worry 'bout it)  
Wanna believe that you're telling the truth  
(So don't doubt it)  
But if you are lying to me...  
  
I'm not leaving tonight (leaving tonight)  
Girl, you're my life  
(Everyone said you ain't no good  
And you prove them right, you're leaving tonight)  
I'm not leaving tonight  
(It's over and done)  
Just leave this alone  
And let's make love  
Till the morning come  
Not leaving tonight  
  
Said I just need you to trust me, baby  
(I wanna trust you)  
Not leaving tonight

[Refrain]  
Baby they mad cause we play how they wanna play  
And they mad cause I say what they wanna say

If I was them I would be mad too  
So let them be mad, whoa  
They can be mad as they want to  
Girl let them be mad  
Go ahead let them be mad  
So we gonna keep moving how we move  
So let them be mad  
  
Blog sites, media talking  
I wonder why they telling me to be cautious  
Filling the blanks while the drama is pouring  
I don't pay attention, I don't really read it too often  
Got niggas hating on me for years I holds it down  
Talking bout the women I'm fucking and the money I spend  
Why they tripping? already knowing that I'm destined to win  
Use it to motivate the grind and they at it again  
Damn, they mad at me, sneak... and throwing a little jab at me  
See me and be mad happy  
Half filled wine glasses as the time passes  
Cooler breeze, eye cashing with the fine accent  
Still on my shit though, remember when I was piss posed  
So now I'm surrounded by powerful niggas that get dough  
Huh, I prolly got your girlfriend wanting to get low  
Infatuated by all the haters, I need to get more  
  
[Refrain]  
  
We get the jealousy and envy  
Cause she can never be you  
And he can never be me  
And she mad at him cause he can never be me  
And she mad at you because you better than she  
They hit the blogsites to see the highlights  
How lighter they life, talking bout our life  
We doing things haters can only dream  
This kinda be messing with they up esteem you know  
  
Do me a favor, keep your nose up out my situation  
Besides your angering mind, your time is what you wasting  
Been through bs in life, can show a demonstration  
But built my shit from the ground up, renovation  
The past lurking, I see they hurting I stall them out  
You where you at for a reason, nothing to talk about  
The roads to success been a lot of ups and downs  
Doing you up, they merry goes, they come around  
  
[Refrain]

Uh  
Hmmm hmmm

But I am saying this can't be us  
Let me get this right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hmm hmm ohhh ooh yeah  
Aw baby aw baby (baby let me get this right) Ohhh  
Hmm hmm hey  
Oh oh yea yea yea yea yeeah  
Let me get this right  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby let me get this right  
La da da

First off let me start by saying  
I ain't trying to get in your jeans  
First I'd rather learn your ups and downs  
And everything in between  
  
I wanna know you, your insecurities  
Secrets and your needs  
I want your mental and your physical too  
And once I've got it I won't stop  
Until you know you're beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
Beautiful as Sunday in the Spring  
Saturday in the Fall  
Beautiful as poetry oh, when you look at me  
Saying nothing at all  
  
I want you to know this  
Girl, I want you to see that it's real  
I want you to feel that you're my focus  
And girl that's what you'll be  
Until I make you see that you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
There's so much for ya, girl, I know that you're beautiful  
Right from your head to your toe you are so beautiful  
There's so much for ya, girl, I know that you're beautiful  
Baby from your head to your toe you are so beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful  
  
I just wanna make ya feel beautiful  
Wanna make ya feel beautiful, girl, that's all I wanna do  
Girl, just let me make ya feel beautiful  
Let me make ya feel beautiful 'cause you are beautiful

Much as you blame yourself, you can't be blamed for the way that you feel  
Had no example of a love, that was even remotely real  
How can you understand something that you never had  
Ooh baby if you let me, I can help you out with all of that  
  
Girl let me love you  
And I will love you  
Until you learn to love yourself  
Girl let me love you  
And all your trouble  
Don't be afraid, girl let me help  
Girl let me love you  
And I will love you  
Until you learn to love yourself  
Girl let me love you  
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life  
I'll take you there  
  
Girl let me love you  
Girl let me love you baby, oh  
Girl let me love yo  
Girl let me love you baby  
Girl let me love you  
Let me love you, let me love you, oh  
  
I can see the pain behind your eyes  
It's been there for quite a while  
I just wanna be the one to remind you what it is to smile  
I would like to show you what true love can really do  
  
Girl let me love you  
And I will love you  
Until you learn to love yourself  
Girl let me love you  
And all your trouble  
Don't be afraid, girl let me help  
Girl let me love you  
And I will love you  
Until you learn to love yourself  
Girl let me love you  
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life  
I'll take you there isha  
  
Girl let me love you baby  
Girl let me love you  
Let me love you, let me love you baby  
Girl let me love you  
Girl let me love you baby  
Girl let me love you  
Let me love you, girl let me love you baby  
  
For every heart that beat  
For every heart that beat  
For every heart that beat  
For every heart that beat, heart that beat...  
  
Girl let me love you  
And I will love you  
Until you learn to love yourself  
Girl let me love you  
And all your trouble  
Don't be afraid, girl let me help  
Girl let me love you  
And I will love you  
Until you learn to love yourself  
Girl let me love you  
A heart of numbness, gets brought to life  
I'll take you there  
  
Girl let me love you  
Let me love you baby, love you baby  
Girl let me love you  
Let me love you baby, love you baby

[Interlude]  
Thank you. You're welcome  
Huh, all right  
(Where to sir?)  
Take us home [?]  
Wait a minute, I didn't say I was coming home with you  
Well I mean, you didn't necessarily say you wasn't  
Stop tryna be cute  
I'm just saying. I want you, it's clear that you want me  
Conceded  
Confident, there's a difference. And to deny our impulses is to deny the very
thing that makes us human  
Spare me the game. It's clear that you want it, the question is, do you
deserve it?  
I can show you so much better than I can tell you, that is if I let you  
Let you what?  
Take you there...

She's starin' at me,  
I'm sittin', wonderin' what she's thinkin'.  
Nobody's talkin',  
'Cause talkin' just turned into screamin'.  
And now is I'm yellin' over her,  
She's yellin' over me.  
All that that means  
Is neither of us is listening,  
(And what's even worse)  
That we don't even remember why were fighting.  
  
So both of us are mad for  
  
Nothin'  
(Fighting for).  
Nothin'  
(Crying for).  
Nothin'  
(Whoa).  
But we won't let it go for  
Nothin'  
(No not for)  
Nothin'.  
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.  
Oh, baby  
I know sometimes  
It's gonna rain  
But baby, can we make up now  
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain  
(Cant sleep through the pain)  
  
[Chorus]  
Girl, I don't wanna go to bed  
(Mad at you),  
And I don't want you to go to bed  
(Mad at me).  
No, I don't wanna go to bed  
(Mad at you),  
And I don't want you to go to bed  
(Mad at me)  
Oh, no, no, no  
  
And it gets me upset, girl  
When you're constantly accusing.  
(Askin' questions like you've already known).  
We're fighting this war, baby  
When both of us are losing.  
(This ain't the way that love is supposed to go).  
Whoa,  
(What happened to workin' it out)  
We've falled into this place  
Where you ain't backin' down  
And I ain't backin' down.  
  
So what the hell do we do now  
It's all for  
  
Nothin'  
(Fighting for).  
Nothin'  
(Crying for).  
Nothin'  
(Whoa).  
But we won't let it go for  
Nothin'  
(No not for)  
Nothin'.  
This should be nothin' to a love like what we got.  
Oh, baby  
I know sometimes  
It's gonna rain  
But baby, can we make up now  
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain  
(Can't sleep through the pain)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh baby this love ain't gonna be perfect,  
(Perfect, perfect, oh oh).  
And just how good it's gonna be.  
We can fuss and we can fight  
Long as everything alright between us  
Before we go to sleep.  
  
Baby, we're gonna be happy.  
  
I know sometimes  
It's gonna rain  
But baby, can we make up now  
'Cause I can't sleep through the pain  
(Can't sleep through the pain).  
  
[Chorus]

Do you love me for me though?  
The real me not my fly alter-ego?  
I know I'm never not fly,  
But if I ever was, would you still ride?  
  
If it's early in the morning and my breath stink  
Would you still roll over kissing on me like it ain't?  
If I didn't have millions in the bank,  
I'm talking cardboard box and a fish tank  
Better yet a fish bowl,  
And if the fame got old  
If the cameras didn't flash when I walk through  
If I wasn't makin' them bands when I walk through  
Is it where I lost you?  
Or is you holding me down?  
You never let 'em bring me down  
All the haters in the world right now  
Would you add to the stress  
Or would you make it easy  
  
For me to take it easy  
That's what I'm lookin' for,  
Baby let me know would you make it easy?  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, eh  
  
Uh girl I know what I need  
Se appeal, intelligence, positive energy  
When the drama comes, she become serenity  
Lady when I need a lady, freak when I need a freak  
Shawty ride like me like I ride the beat  
Everything bout her quality  
Why I send her and her girls to Dubai for bout a week  
Just a little reward for, for when she hold me down  
Never let 'em bring me down  
All the haters in the world right now  
You're the one that I'm lookin' for to make it easy  
  
Baby, girl  
For me to take it easy  
That's what I'm lookin' for,  
Baby let me know would you make it easy?  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, eh  
  
Where you at? Ey?  
Shawty where you at?  
Baby girl, we got bags to pack  
We got trips to take, if you cool with that  
Show me that you got my back  
Let me see that you got my back  
Then we'll get into all that  
Said we'll get into all that  
You have to make it easy  
For me to take it easy  
That's what I'm lookin' for,  
Baby let me know would you make it easy?  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, ooh oh ooh oh  
Ooh oh ooh oh oh  
(Easy for me to chill, easy for us to feel)  
Easy to take it easy  
That's what I'm looking for,  
Baby let me know, eh eh

Cause everybody's looking at her  
Something 'bout the way we meet the door  
We catch eyes as we walk by  
We demand attention  
And there's something about the way we take the floor  
Effortless flight  
That's when I lean in close to mention girl  
  
Maybe it's you  
Maybe it's me  
And for whatever reason

I must be honest with you babe

But when I'm behind you holding your hips and you close your eyes and bite
your lips  
  
I can see you so might I suggest a change  
Now mama please don't take me strange for what I'm about to say

Watching ourselves make love  
Girl why don't we  
  
And I'm a keep your chin up please watch me do the...nasty

Mami if I pull your head back  
'Cause I want you to see that we look so good together

Your day but featuring me starring you  
Baby that's okay with me

[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
  
Can we make love in front of a mirror [Repeat until fade]

Hello, good evening  
  
Came in here, shut the world out  
Nothing to get into, nothing to bein' bout  
Just grab a little bite, quite a little night  
By no means looking for Miss Right  
But hello, good evening  
  
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (That I could tell)  
Beautiful, barely any make-up on (So natural)  
The kind that make you wanna put the games away  
Think about the future, but first I'll say  
Hello, good evening  
  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
What are you doing here?  
Oh Miss Right, wasn't expecting you tonight  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
How about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life  
Oh, Miss Right, yeah  
  
But ain't it amazing?  
Spend forever looking, all the time wasting  
Soon as I throw my hands up and say I quit  
Turn the corner and there my future sits  
Hello, good evening  
  
Clearly she was out with her girls alone (That I could tell)  
Beautiful barely any make-up on (So natural)  
The kind that make you wanna put the games away  
Think about the future, but first I'll say  
Hello, good evening  
  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
What are you doing today? (What are you doin' baby)  
Wasn't expecting you tonight  
Oh Miss Right, Miss Right  
How about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life  
  
Please forgive if I'm forward , hmm  
But this chance won't pass me by  
'Cause, see, I'm looking at forever  
And it's the most beautiful thing I've seen in my life  
Ooh Miss Right  
  
Miss Right, what are you doing here? (So what are you doin' here baby)  
Wasn't expecting you tonight (I wasn't expecting you tonight, ohh)  
Miss Right, how about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life (The rest my life)  
  
Miss Right, what are you doing here? (The rest of my life)  
Wasn't expecting you tonight  
Miss Right, how about we disappear?  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life  
  
Said if you got no plans, baby if you got time  
Come and be the rest of my life

You can move along  
I believe that we are done  
Whatever we was trying to do  
Cause you up and did me wrong  
Cupid got a big gun but a blindfold  
She gave another brother access to her little black dress  
You know the one, short silky and backless  
You need an Oscar, as she was an actress  
I called and met someone, into the mattress?  
Now she's lying to my face  
Eyes burning up like her words was mace  
I don't even hear what she was trying say  
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable  
To the lies I'm deaf  
All I can here is to the left to the left  
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket  
Your stuff, I already packed it  
I'm being polite  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if that's how you feel you can just  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite  
And if I seem a bit chill  
It's because I don't sweat the small  
Find another girl, please believe I will  
I aint tripping off you at all  
A boss from the beginning  
Been there for a minute  
So me losing you was me still me winning  
Found out about you sinning  
So you wonder what the hell I'm dreaming  
Now you're lying to my face  
Eyes burning up like her words was mace  
I don't even hear what you're was trying say  
Song playing in my head, irreplaceable  
To the lies I'm deaf  
All I can here is to the left to the left  
So I say get out and don't touch that jacket  
Your stuff, I already packed it  
I'm being polite  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if that's how you feel you can just  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite  
Please don't get me wrong  
Baby understand I'm trying to say get gone, the nicest way I can  
Cause I'm not what you want  
See I tried to make this work but our loves in the dirt, so lets see who calls
who first  
I'm moving along  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite  
I don't wanna be rude, I don't mean to be mean but I don't gotta deal with
this mess  
Telling me I need you when you know you need me  
But if that's how you feel you can just  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
No argument, no fight  
Move along, move along, move along, move along  
I'm just trying to be polite

Well I wear my clothes like this because I can  
And I wear my hair like this because I can  
And I walk around like this because I can  
And I do my thing like this because it's who I am  
  
Pre chorus:  
And if you're respecting me to give you an apology  
Be nothing that you used to, used to  
Go round on the head away  
Hold your breath and concentrate  
Keep hold your face until you turn to, turn to  
  
Chorus:  
My road it ain't your road I trust I know  
And I know just where I'm going, hey  
And my flow it ain't your flow  
But trust I know  
I know just how I'm flowing  
And I'ma do my thing  
I'ma do my, I'ma do my thing  
Please feel to ehar it from... Complaining  
But I'ma do my thing  
I'ma do my thing  
Say whatever you want  
But this will ain't gonna change  
I'ma do my thing  
Keep doing what you do and I'ma do my thing  
  
Hey I came with my clothes are you because I'm not  
I can't do my hair like because I'm not  
I can't walk around like you because I'm not  
I can't do my hair like you because I'm high  
  
Pre chorus:  
And if you're respecting me to give you an apology  
Be nothing that you used to, used to  
Go round on the head away  
Hold your breath and concentrate  
Keep hold your face until you turn to, turn to  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You don't know where I'm going  
And so you think I'm lost  
I ain't on your page okay  
So that means I'm off  
When I'm... To the beat of the drum  
... And the problem must be you and me  
And regular but not... Element  
... Wherever not cool  
You're not from my... Well give me what I don't get you  
Either... So if I'm gonna do fast and you up  
And mine is...  
  
[Chorus:]

Maybe I was wrong  
Maybe you were right  
Maybe I don't listen  
Like I should  
Maybe when I don't  
Don't come home at night  
It tends to bother you  
Maybe I could start  
Answering a page  
Call if I'd be late  
That'd be good  
What I'm trying to say  
Is that I'm gonna try  
And do better for you  
  
I'm aware  
That they're some faults  
In this relationship  
Where I could try  
A bit harder than I do  
And so I'm telling you  
  
I'm not  
I'm not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby, please  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So I'm  
So imperfect  
Just don't give up on me  
You will see  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
  
Maybe I don't ask  
You about your day  
Maybe I act  
Like I don't care  
Girl I really do  
I just got a whole lot  
On my mind right now  
Baby, I don't want  
You to go away  
Everything is wrong  
If you're not there  
Tell me what you want  
And I'm gonna try  
To give it all  
To you somehow  
  
I'm aware  
That they're some faults  
In this relationship  
Where I could try  
A bit harder than I do  
And so I'm telling you  
  
I'm not  
I'm not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby, please  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So I'm  
So imperfect  
Just don't give up on me  
You will see  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
  
I know  
You can do  
Better than me  
But I don't want  
Nobody but you  
And I know  
You don't think  
I appreciate you  
Let me show you  
That is not true  
  
(2x):  
I'm not  
I'm not perfect  
Just making sure with me  
Baby, please  
I'm gonna be so right  
For you girl  
So I'm  
So imperfect

Talking about I can't do it for you  
But you can do it for yourself  
Even though that ain't so  
Baby cos my dough don't know how to end  
But that independent thing I'm with it  
All we do is win, baby

But when it come to love

Okay, now here's what I want you to do  
I want you to look me right in my eyes  
And I want you to tell me exactly  
What you want me to do to you  
You ready?  
  
Your body whispering from under the sheets  
I hear it moaning, begging loud and clearly  
I'm rather fluent in the language it speaks, yes  
But it's your mouth I want to tell it to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, why don't you  
Tell me what you want me to do to you?  
Say it, say it, say it  
Girl, why don't you  
Tell me what you want from me?  
Girl, won't you  
Say it, say it, say it?  
  
It's not as if I'm not totally aware  
That you want my hands right here and my mouth right there  
Girl, don't play shy, show me how bold you can be  
Open your mouth and tell me where you want me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me what you want  
Oh, you want that?  
Say the word  
Turn around  
  
Anything that you want, baby  
Tell me you want it

Tell me what you want  
I'm hoping and wishing  
Name your position  
I got it, babe  
Tell me what you want, and I got it, babe  
Anything that you want, baby  
Tell me you want it

Tell me what you want, and I got it  
I'm hoping and wishing  
Name your position

[Chorus]  
  
Yeah  
  
Say it, say it  
  
Tell me how you want it, girl  
Tell me how you want it, girl

(Remix) I love her 'cause she got her own  
She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone  
There ain't nothing that's more sexy, then a girl  
That want but don't need me  
Young independent (yea she work hard)  
But you can't tell from the way that she walk  
She don't slow down, 'cause she ain't got time  
To be complaining, shawty goin' shine  
She don't expect nothing from no guy  
She plays aggressive, but she still shy  
But you never know her softer side,  
By looking in her eyes  
Knowing she can do for herself  
Makes me wanna give her my wealth  
Only kinda girl I want,  
Independent queen,  
Workin' for her throne  
  
[Chorus]  
I love her 'cause she got her own, she got her own  
I love her 'cause she got her own  
She got her own (I love it when she say)  
Its cool I got it, I got it, I got it  
(I love it when she say) it's cool I got it, I got it, I got it (Remix)  
  
I love her 'cause she got her own  
She don't need mine, she say leave mine alone  
There ain't nothing that's more sexy,  
Then a girl that want but don't need me  
Lovely face, nice thick thighs,  
Plus she got drive that matches my drive  
Sexy thing, she's Ms. Fly  
All the while paying her bills on time  
She don't look at me like captain save 'em  
Gold digging, no she don't do that  
Now she look at me like inspiration,  
She wanna be complimenting my swag  
And everything she got, she work for it,  
Good life made for it, she take pride in saying  
That she paid for it, only kind of girl I want  
Independent queen, working for her throne  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't make me laugh boo, never did that bad too,  
Make you even have to but even if I had to  
Ask my better half to, you'd be more than glad to  
When I do that math boo, you always try and add two  
I need someone who ride for me  
Not someone who ride for free  
She say boy I don't just ride  
She'll pull up beside of me, I had to ask her  
What she doing in that caddy  
She say cause you my baby  
I'll be stunting like my daddy  
And there's not many, who catch my eye  
We both wearin' Gucci, she match my fly  
And that's why I supposed to keep her closer  
Right by my side toaster in the holster  
And now she went Loso case you didn't know so  
You can save your money dog, shawty getting dough so  
What she care what his cost, you can call her miss boss  
I got it backwards, Kriss Kross shawty got her own  
  
Now all my ladies that don't need a man for nothing,  
'Cept some of that good lovin' let me here you say oh oh oh oh  
  
And all my fellas know you need to stop the frontin'  
if you love an independent woman let me hear you say oh oh oh oh  
  
I love her cause she got her own (got her own)  
I love her cause she got her own (she got her own)  
I love it when she say It's cool I got it, I got it, I got it  
I love it when she say uh uh, I got it, I got it, I got it

Caught up in the whirlwind  
I'm just a dragonfly yea  
And my wings ain't helping me yea  
  
I'm in a little trouble  
Should ,didn't see this coming tonight  
Have no clue what I'm gonna do now  
  
And ask me who's put me in this twist  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
Caught up in the whirlwind no one can help me  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
So now I'm in love  
And I didn't want to be  
And all because of she  
And all because of she  
  
Days ain't long enough  
Nights are even shorter this ain't fair  
Time don't wanna give me what I need  
All I'm asking is forever  
  
Forever little moment  
Listen to me this ain't how I told  
I don't know what she done to me  
But I like it  
  
And ask me who's put me in this twist  
Ask me who's responsible for this

And now I'm in love  
And I didn't want to be

Said it's getting hard for me  
To picture me without you  
With every passing day baby  
But it's easy to answer who's the owner of my heart  
See me look at you and say  
  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
Caught up in the whirlwind no one can help me  
Ask me who's responsible for this  
She is  
Everything's all her fault  
And now I'm in love  
And I didn't want to be  
And all because of she  
And all because of she  
And all because of she  
And all because of she

[Verse 1]  
She said "I know, I know, I know your music  
I prefer your old shit to your new shit  
That song with Pitbull, it was kinda cool  
But after that, you went left and I couldn't fuck with you"  
Well damn, couldn't help but appreciate  
That she was bold enough to say this to my face  
She even went as far to give me her Twitter name  
She said, "I tweeted you and told you the same thing"  
But, she said, "I never thought I'd meet  
And you cuter in real life than on TV  
You a celebrity  
You could have any girl you want, what the hell you want with me?"  
  
[Chorus]  
I told her, "Baby, there is a difference  
Between what you really want and what you can get  
I can have anything, but I don't want just anything  
I want you tonight, I want you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I said, "You got, you got, you got me twisted  
What my celebrity got to do with it?  
Just cause I can have don't mean I want them chicks  
I take quality over quantity any day, you dig?"  
She said, "I'm hood though, Ne-Yo  
And I know you be on your goody good though, Ne-Yo  
Get ratchet, yes I could, though, Ne-Yo  
Mess up your image, I probably would though, Ne-Yo"  
I said, "You don't scare me  
The word "gentleman" starts with "G""  
She said, "You a celebrity  
You could have any girl you want, what you want with me?"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Now that she sat there, lookin' at me like she wasn't sure  
Questionin' my intentions, why and what for  
Thinkin', "He can have actresses, singers or models galore  
I work in a nail shop, every day in that bitch from 8 until 4"  
Shawty's a rose that grows through the cracks in the concrete  
Her mother's body but her brother's knowledge of the street  
Kick all you beautiful lies, shawty ain't goin' for 'em  
She type stubborn, like her daddy, but she don't know him  
Got me feelin' like I ain't good enough  
I ain't a D-boy or a thug so I ain't hood enough  
Or maybe it's the other way around and shawty's self esteem is down  
Not good enough to wife but good enough to fuck, nah mama  
I'm really tryna get to know  
What's under your garden, not just what's under your clothes  
You feel me?  
And don't concern yourself with status, I don't  
It ain't about what I can have, it's about what I want, you dig?  
  
[Chorus]

She fresh up out the shower  
'Bout to go to bed  
She been calling her man for hours  
And he ain't picking up his phone  
And soon the other night she's all alone  
She wished she had someone to put it on  
But she don't so she gon' let me put her rivers on  
She rubbing lotion on her body  
Pretending that her hands are mine  
Touching herself how she want me to touch her  
I'm not a star in her mind I'm her lover  
  
She close her eyes  
She can't stop it no  
She hypnotised  
My music playing in the background  
She's almost there yeah yeah yeah  
She turns it up  
She lets my voice get her there  
She use me as part of her masturbation  
  
She hear my song and she can't stop her legs from shaking  
Woah woah ah ah yeah yeah  
  
She pictures herself naked  
On her knees I'm behind her  
Ooh and she can barely take it  
Specially when I go deep  
So deep  
For a minute she swear I'm there and she can feel me  
Feel me  
She opens up her eyes  
Gotta start to get rubbing lotion on her body  
Touching herself how she want me to touch her  
I'm not a star in her mind I'm her lover  
  
She close her eyes  
She can't stop it no  
She hypnotised  
My music playing in the background  
She's almost there yeah yeah yeah  
She turns it up  
She lets my voice get her there  
She use me as part of her masturbation  
  
Hear my song and her legs just won't stop shaking  
Yeah yeah

Don't you hate a coulda' woulda' shoulda'? (oh oh no, oh oh no)  
Coulda' did what it did why ya shoulda' shoulda'? (oh oh no, oh oh no)  
  
If I had a dollar for every should be, know how reach I would be  
Like they say it is what it is, not what it could be,  
Can't cry feel guilt over spilled milk,  
I'm too fly, I'm too cool, word to Versace silk,  
And my watch be filled with mad diamonds  
I got good watches just bad timing (Oh oh no)  
The chick I met at the club was cute,  
Still feel like I'm getting brain from the substitute,  
'Cause this ain't you and that ain't me,  
Claim you happy then why you're so mad at me?  
Can't hold on to what you had just what you got,  
You should be here, but you're not.  
  
I'm doing it again  
What I told myself I would not do, oh  
It's 4:15 AM I'm sittin' here drinkin', reminiscing on you, oh  
And how I used to let you smoke even though I don't  
You get blowed then we both get low  
As I lay here with some girl I don't' know  
In the back of my mind one million times  
I tell myself  
  
It should be you, should be you  
Should be you and me right now  
Said it should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you and me right now oh oh  
  
As I watch her sleep, all that I can think  
She's beautiful (Beautiful but she's not you) but she's not you  
Love her just a night, then out of my life (Out of my life)  
Damn why can't I do this right?  
When you told me you wanted to leave (Wanted to leave)  
I pretended it didn't hurt me (didn't hurt me)  
But as I lay here I can hardly breathe,  
Laying next to she, when in reality, it should be  
  
It should be you, should be you  
Should be you and me right now  
Said it should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you and me right now oh oh  
  
Uh uh should be you, should be you baby ah  
  
Hey check this out  
My life, lights camera fame and action,  
Feeling dreams from all these private planes I'm catchin'  
Willing to trade all the flashy chains I'm flashin' for a night  
Back up for us, exchangin' pain and passion, (Let's go)  
Romances, kinda like the Phantom doors you used to ride  
'Cause it's tryin' to open up, it's like suicide  
God teaches lessons every day,  
You was all I needed like Meth' and Mary J  
The sun don't shine forever  
Any time that we fall that just means we just climb together  
Guess we avoided what we could've went through  
That don't change the fact (Girl it should be you) that it should've been you  
  
It should be you, should be you  
Should be you and me right now (Should be you and me, girl)  
Said it should be you (should be you)  
Should be you (Should be you)  
Should be you and me right now ah  
  
Oh said it should be you  
It should be you, you, whoa  
I said it should be you, it should be you, uh oh oh oh

He was supposed to bring u here tonight  
Couldn't find him so you came alone

And the music your enjoying  
So for the next couple minutes

[Bridge]

[Chorus]

[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Be your boyfriend till the song goes off

Gotta change my answering machine, now that I'm alone  
'Cause right now it says that "We can't come to the phone"  
And I know it makes no sense, 'cause you walked out the door  
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore  
  
(It's ridiculous)  
It's been months and for some reason I just  
(Can't get over us)  
And I'm stronger than this  
  
(Enough is enough)  
No more walking round with my head down  
I'm so over being blue, crying over you  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Gotta fix that calendar I have that's marked July 15th  
Because since there's no more you, there's no more anniversary  
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you and your memory  
And now every song reminds me of what used to be  
  
That's the reason I'm  
So sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
(Leave me alone)  
Leave me alone  
(Stupid love songs)  
Don't make me think about her smile  
Or having my first child  
Let it go  
Turning off the radio  
  
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
So why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing she was still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs, so tired of tears  
So done with wishing you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs, so sad and slow  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
(Why can't I turn off the radio?)  
Why can't I turn off the radio?

Sa pag bukas ng radyo  
Ikaw agad ang nasa isip ko  
Mga kantang tungkol sa pag-ibig  
Sinasaktan ako  
At ang lagay ng puso ko sumisigaw  
Dahil ang 'sang taong katulad mo  
  
Sa bawat oras na nakikinig ako  
Pilit kong patayin isarado  
Ang tugtuging tungkol  
Sa mga nagmamahaln at kaso  
Iba ang nangyari sa 'ting dalawa  
Naghiwalay dahil sa araw gabi  
Lagi nalang tayong nag-aaway  
  
At sa ngayon nagbago na ako  
Mas gugustuhin ko pang mag isa  
Kaysa masaktan pang muli  
Ito na ang huli tapos na  
Ang pagmamahalan dati kong minimithi  
Ngayon ko na tinatabi  
  
If you're so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
You said you love me oh why aren't you here  
I'm so sick of your love songs so sad and slow  
But I just can't turn off the radio  
  
Simula palang ikaw na  
Ang tanging isip at  
Panaginip kong nasira  
Di maka tiis nung marinig  
Ang himig ng radyong  
Hinatid sa'tin ng dati nating ala-ala  
Noong tayo pa noon ang magkasama at maligaya  
  
Pero ngayon wala at nasira sa pagdating ng tadhana  
Ikaw parin ang ibig makasama  
Makatabi walang problemang nadarama  
Pero wala na tapos na  
Kaya ngayon patuloy ang maglakbay  
Nang nag-iisa sa mga awitin to'y ako'y sawa na ngayon  
At isip sa sarili at puro sisi  
Kung ba't pa sya  
Ang binohusan ng abala  
Silbihan ng habang buhay  
Sya'y maging maligaya  
  
If you're so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
You said you love me oh why aren't you here  
I'm so sick of your love songs so sad and slow  
But I just can't turn off the radio  
  
Yeah oh at kung bakit 'di magtanong sa langit  
Pagkalabit ko ang lapis pilit kong  
Isulat ang tunay na damdamin  
Nadarama kong hindi ka na talaga sa akin  
Ikaw, tayong dalawa punong puno ng akit  
Pagsisisi sa isip sa panaginip hatid pa rin  
Ay puno ng sakit at palagi nalang luha  
Ang binigay sa akin  
  
'di ko na kayang kayanin isipin  
Litrato natin gusto ko nang punitin  
At sa'kin dahil ikaw lang ang tunay kong minamahal  
Ang akin 'di gaya ng dati ang saya ang ligaya natin  
Ngayon dinadala na ng hangin wala na  
Tapos na paalam na paalam na sa bituin  
  
If you're so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
You said you love me oh why aren't you here  
I'm so sick of your love songs so sad and slow  
But I just can't turn off the radio  
  
Ooh (Leave me alone)  
Leave me alone  
(Stupid love songs)  
Hey don't make me think about her smile  
Or having my first child  
I'm letting go  
Turning off the radio  
  
If you're so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
You said you love me oh why aren't you here  
I'm so sick of your love songs so sad and slow  
But I just can't turn off the radio  
  
If you're so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
You said you love me oh why aren't you here  
I'm so sick of your love songs so sad and slow  
But I just can't turn off the radio (why I can't turn off the radio)  
  
And I'm so sick of love songs  
So tired of tears  
So done with wishin' you were still here  
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow  
  
Why can't I turn off the radio?  
  
(why can't I turn off the radio? )  
Why can't I turn off the radio?

So it's over  
He's with someone else and you know her  
And you just can get any lower  
You sit in the dark alone  
And won't answer your phone  
Well I'm sorry. I want to attend your pity party  
I rather go have calamari  
And maybe a drink  
And yes I think  
You should come with me  
  
Life is long  
There will be pain but life goes on  
With everyday a brand new song  
But if you rather stay at home  
Let me do you a favor  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll ask the sun to shine away from you today so you can cry  
(If that's what you want)  
I'll ask the clouds to bring the rain for you today so you can cry  
(If that's what you want alright)  
Oh If that's what you want alright  
  
I'ma Lover  
And the pain of a heart from another  
Can be difficult to recover  
Yes this I know  
But difficult isn't impossible  
And you shiver (Shiver)  
He was your warmth  
You Cry Lips Quiver  
Well honey go on cry me a river  
You wanna be down (you wanna be down)  
Fine let me help you out  
How bout  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And your tears won't bring him back  
I know you wish that it did  
But it just don't work like that  
Oh I know that healings takes time  
Hey even your heart has a pace  
Oh but how much time are you gonna take  
Hmm too much will be a mistake  
  
[Chorus]

OK,  
I woke up in heaven today  
She kissed me I floated away, away  
Never felt anything so great  
Alright,  
Now I brace myself for a fight  
Something must go wrong  
Cuz it's way to right  
I'm light as a feather tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause I can't feel the ground  
Someone let me down  
I never felt so high as I do now  
It's too good to be true  
I don't deserve you  
I never felt a love strong enough to  
Stop this world from spinning  
Stop this world from spinning  
  
And I see,  
Heaven when she looks at me  
In her smile is the most amazing dream  
And in her eyes I fall asleep  
And I hope,  
Hope that she can see through the smoke  
Of my imperfections into my soul  
And my heart where she has control (she has control)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Happiness like this can never last (can never last)  
Turns into the memories of the past (turns into the memories of the past)  
(Going just as fast)  
  
[Chorus]

[Intro]  
Aiight boys and girls, gather 'round. Story time. Check this out  
  
[Verse 1]  
I said, "I wish you'd just give it a try  
You've never done it, how you know what you don't like?"  
She said, "Am I not enough for you, is that why?"  
I said, "No, I just think it would be sexy and kinda fly"  
She said, "Well I don't"  
I said, "Well if I let you pick the girl, would that make a difference?"  
She said, "That don't matter cause I just don't think I'm cool with a
threesome"  
  
[Interlude]  
What? Come on. Man you trippin'  
  
[Verse 2]  
I said, "You actin' funny and I don't even know why  
Cause you can't tell me that you don't like girls, don't lie"  
She said, "I can appreciate a pretty face, a nice backside (Oh word)  
But just cause I might find a girl sexy, that does not make me bi"  
I said, "Yes it does"  
She said, "[?] you just wish I was"  
I said, "Why you frontin'?  
Just embrace who you really are  
And you just might enjoy, a threesome"  
  
[Interlude]  
You never know. Got to open up your mind. You only live once, know what I'm
talkin' 'bout? Nah but for real though, you never thought about it? Never?
Aiight  
  
[Verse 3]  
She said, "What if I said I want to bring in another guy?" What! ?  
I just gave her a look like "you done lost your [?] mind"  
She said, "Oh, okay so another girl is fine  
But when I mention another dude you're lookin' like you wanna punch me in the
eye"  
I said, "Don't tempt me"  
She said, "You know that ain't fair"  
I said, "I'm just playin'  
But for real don't no dudes allowed  
Only you, me and she in this threesome"  
She said, "Hold up, when did I agree to this threesome"  
I said, "Just now, and you can't take it back, let's have a threesome"  
She said, "Well I did think about my girl Stephanie before in a threesome"  
I said, "I got her number, I'll call her right now for this threesome"  
  
[Outro]  
She said, "Wait a minute. You got Stephanie's number? When'd you get
Stephanie's number?"  
I said, "Uhhh..."  
The end

In the beat of ecstasy  
Come to me, girl  
  
(Chorus)  
  
And I will  
Keep you warm  
Through the shadows  
Of the night  
Let me touch you  
With my love  
I can make you  
Feel so right  
And baby  
Through the years  
Even when  
We're old and gray  
I will love you  
More each day  
'Cause you  
Will always be  
The lady in my life  
  
Stay with me  
I want you  
To stay with me

Spoken  
  
How's everybody doin? Hope you enjoyin' The Truth, The Way, The problem thus
far. This is your friendly host Ne-Yo. I like to entitle this masterpiece here

Verse 1  
  
Well can I be honest baby (I don't know your name)  
And if you never told me (Wouldn't bother me just the same)  
I'm tryna get that, get that  
Drop you off somewhere and then get back  
To the club and do it all again  
But let's not focus on the future (Did you come here with your friends,
please, give one of them your keys, cause you comin' wit me)  
Sorry, if I'm bossin' you around but  
I like what I see and I get what I like  
So that's how it's goin' down girl  
  
Chorus  
  
You gon' finish that drink, I'm gon' finish this drink  
We gon' go and get in my ride  
Ok and then  
You gon' take yo clothes off, I'm gon' take my clothes off  
We gon' go somewhere and get right

Verse 2  
  
Well can you take me to the place where the grass is greener  
Ladies roll wit me because my whip is cleaner  
Than average come to my crib (hot sex) we havin it  
Slangin' baby, frontin baby, well, that could be handled it  
Can I get a witness, I like girls with thickness (head game insane)  
Stay up out our business  
Shawty, just shake that thang to the sound 'cause

And that's how it's goin' down girl  
  
Chorus
