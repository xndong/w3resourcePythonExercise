Don't you know that I'll be around to guide you  
Through your weakest moments to leave them behind you  
Returning nightmares only shadows  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now  
  
Crosses all over, heavy on your shoulders  
The sirens inside you waiting to step forward  
Disturbing silence darkens you sight  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright for now  
  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
Crosses all over the boulevard  
  
The streets outside your window over flooded  
People staring, they know you've been broken  
Repeatedly reminded by the looks on their faces  
Ignore them tonight and you'll be alright  
We'll cast some light and you'll be alright

I lie awake  
I've gone to ground  
I'm watching porn  
In my hotel dressing gown  
Now I dream of you  
But I still believe  
There's only enough for one in this  
Lonely hotel suite  
  
The journey's long  
And it feels so bad  
I'm thinking back to the last day we had  
Old moon fades into the new  
Soon I know I'll be back with you  
I'm nearly with you  
I'm nearly with you  
  
When I'm weak I draw strength from you  
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood  
And when I'm down you breathe life over me  
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny  
  
On a clear day  
I'll fly home to you  
I 'm bending time getting back to you  
Old moon fades into the new  
Soon I know I'll be back with you  
I'm nearly with you  
I'm nearly with you  
  
When I'm weak I draw strength from you  
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood  
And when I'm down you breathe life over me  
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny  
  
When I'm weak I draw strength from you  
And when you're lost I know how to change your mood  
And when I'm down you breathe life over me  
Even though we're miles apart we are each other's destiny  
  
I'll fly, I'll fly home  
I'll fly home and I'll fly home

Fancy a big house  
Some kids and a horse  
I can not quite, but nearly  
Guarantee, a divorce  
I think that I love you  
I think that I do  
So go on mister, make Miss me Mrs you.  
  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I do  
I only make jokes to distract myself  
From the truth, from the truth.  
  
Fancy a fast car  
A bag full of loot  
I can nearly guarantee  
You'll end up with the boot  
  
I love you, I love you, I love you , I do  
I only make jokes to distract myself  
From the truth, from the truth.  
I love you, I love you, I love you , I do  
I only make jokes to distract myself  
From the truth, from the truth.

Made a note of it  
Did you write it on your hand  
Put a name on it  
To help you understand  
  
Well do you see  
The futures holidays are for me  
Just let me know  
Where we go after the fall  
  
Like the sound of it  
Gonna hang it on your wall  
Turn and run with it  
For the sake of one and all  
Where you go, nobody knows  
  
Well do you see  
The futures holidays are for me  
Just let me know  
Where to go  
Where you go after the fall

Lost in cheap delirium  
Searching the neon lights  
I move carefully  
Sink in the city aquarium  
Sing in the key of night  
As they're watching me  
  
Take me somewhere we can be alone  
Make me somewhere I can call a home  
'Cause lately I've been losing my own  
  
Wrapped in silent elegance  
Beautifully broken down  
As illusions burst  
Too late to learn from experience  
Too late to wonder how  
To finish first  
  
Take me somewhere we can be alone  
Make me somewhere I can call a home  
'Cause lately I've been losing my own  
  
Take me somewhere we can be alone  
Make me somewhere I can call a home  
Won't you take me home  
Won't you take me home  
'Cause lately I've been losing my own  
Won't you take me home

Have you ever wondered  
If it smarts when you've hurt and ignored  
Oh, the sort that goes away  
Even though I waited for you  
Oh, how I adore you  
  
You never saw my face  
I traced your path each day  
We could be always together  
  
Now I watch you bleed  
You had all I need  
How I love you so  
Now we'll never know  
If I can't have you  
  
I even did the research  
Went to work, learned to flirt  
Wore a skirt and faced dirt  
And, ah, still you didn't notice  
You never focused on me  
  
You never saw my face  
I traced your path each day  
You never lifted your eyes to me, ah  
  
Now I watch you bleed  
You had all I need  
How I love you so  
Now we'll never know  
If I can't have you  
  
If I can't have you  
If I can't have you  
If I can't have you

Wait in line  
'Till your time  
Ticking clock  
Everyone stop  
  
Everyone's saying different things to me  
Different things to me  
Everyone's saying different things to me  
Different things to me  
  
Whoa  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
There doesn't seem to be anybody else who agrees with me  
  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
Motionless wheel  
Nothing is real  
Wasting my time  
In the waiting line  
Do you believe in  
What you see  
  
Nine to five  
Living lies  
Everyday  
Stealing time  
Everyone's taking everything they can  
Everything they can  
Everyone's taking everything they can  
Everything they can  
  
Whoa  
Do you believe  
In what you feel  
It doesn't seem to be anybody else who agrees with me  
  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
Motionless wheel  
Nothing is real  
Wasting my time  
In the waiting line  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
  
Ah and I'll shout and I'll scream  
But I'd rather not have seen  
And I'll hide away for another day  
  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
Motionless wheel  
Nothing is real  
Wasting my time  
In the waiting line  
Do you believe  
In what you see  
  
Everyone's saying different things to me  
Different things to me  
Different things to me  
Different things to me  
Different things to me  
Everyone's taking everything they can  
Everything they can

All the words are calling  
Got time on my own  
There's no destination  
Wondering whether I'll feel it again  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
'Cause there's nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself around  
  
The autumn leaves are falling  
Falling down on me  
And there's nothing I can do  
And there's nothing I can say  
That's gonna change the way I feel  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
'Cause there's nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself around  
  
Take this time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself  
Change itself around  
  
I feel it's true  
All alone without you  
I feel it's true  
'Cause you're running with the wind  
And you're running with your life  
Won't you come inside  
  
Keep my hands off the wheel  
'Cause there's nowhere else to go  
  
Take some time  
Just hang around awhile  
Like to sit this silent moment out  
I don't want to lose or let you down  
Time's just gonna change itself around

I made my head touch my hands  
And it's right on me, yeah  
I touched the night now it's gone  
Felt it right on me, yeah  
  
I'm runnin' hard, and the dust  
Now it's right on me, yeah  
I'm riding blind  
And these words are all over me  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, lost them in the forest  
Oh, dawn is almost on us  
Oh, spell is gettin' stronger  
Oh,  
  
Cause my mama's and my daddy's  
The wishin' that I'm wishing too  
Down the well there's nothing that wet  
And it's all in my head  
Hear what I heard  
If I didn't dream, I don't care  
  
I'm thinkin' of your style  
I know that spell even the way that  
You  
You gimme what I want  
That kinda thing and that feeling  
So right, so right  
Feels good, feels good  
Still feel it, still feel it  
On me, on me  
I feel, I feel  
It's on me, it's on me  
Sorry  
  
I've worked these hands  
And prepared now it's right on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The wishin' that I'm wishing too  
Down the well there's nothing that wet  
And it's all in my head  
Hear what I heard  
If I didn't dream, I don't care  
  
So right, so right  
Feels good, feels good  
Still feel it, still feel it  
On me, on me  
I feel, that's right  
It's on me, it's on me  
Sorry  
  
So fine, I got to run  
So excited, so excited  
See the sun, see the sun  
I feel, its alright  
Someday  
  
So right, so right  
Feels good, feels good  
Still feel it, still feel it  
On me, on me  
I feel, I feel  
It's on me, it's on me  
Sorry  
So fine, I got to run  
So excited, so excited  
See the sun, see the sun  
I feel, its alright  
Someday

Close your eyes  
Can't you see it's burning slow  
Fading down the sparks of fire earth bound  
Space in two  
Warm beyond the love below  
Close your eyes  
It's time for us to go  
  
Over our heads  
Light keeps passing through  
Over our heads  
Lite from me to you  
  
Falling down  
Way beneath the healing skies  
Rise and shine  
The crying times left behind  
  
Over our heads  
All we see is true  
Over our heads  
Can't you see it too  
  
Over our heads  
Light keeps passing through  
Over our heads  
Lite from me to you

Don't think you love me  
Confusion settling in  
I don't think I'll be staying  
Around here, anymore  
  
There's no question that I love you  
But I'm living in my own time  
And here I am debating  
Whether I'm wrong, or right  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
All the promises I gave you  
Helped me to survive  
And all the times I wished you'd save me  
You were the love of my life  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
Who am I  
To make a judgment of  
Your life  
I'm only  
Passing by  
Passing by  
  
I'm only passing by

You're the prince to my ballerina  
You'll feed all the people's parking meters  
You encourage the eating of ice cream  
And you would somersault in sand with me  
  
You talk to loners  
You ask 'how's your week?'  
You give love to all  
And give love to me  
You're obsessed with hiding  
The sticks and stones  
And feel the unknown  
You feel like home  
You feel like home  
  
You put my feet back on the ground  
Oh, did you know you brought me home  
Yeah, you were sweet and you were sound  
Can you save me  
  
You're the wars in my summer's breeze  
You're the ivories in my ebony key  
You would share your last jelly bean  
And you would somersault in sand with me  
  
You put my feet back on the ground  
Oh, did you know you brought me home  
Yeah, you were sweet and you were sound  
You save me  
  
You put my feet (back on the ground)  
Oh, did you know you brought me (home)  
Yeah you were sweet and you were (sound)  
See I have tried  
You still bring me around 'n around 'n around  
  
'n around 'n around 'n around  
Yeah yeah oh oh  
You brought me around  
Yeah yeah oh oh

I don't need you anymore  
I'm okay and I am sure  
I don't need you anymore  
Yeah I'm okay, I'm reassured  
  
And I don't need you not today  
I promise I'll call I promise I'll say  
I don't need you not to stay  
And if you ever need me I'll reciprocate  
  
Your shoulders in my pocket  
Speed dial No. Two  
See you when I need you  
See you when I do  
See you when I do  
  
Do you need me, I am here  
Can you ask, can you be clear  
Yes you need me, I appear  
Now you are me, I am here  
  
Your shoulders in your pocket  
Speed dial No. Two  
Call it when you need me  
See you when I do  
See you when I do  
  
Call me when you need me  
Just call me when you need me  
  
Call me when you need me  
See you when I do

Was it loneliness that brought you here  
Broken and weak  
Was it tiredness that made you sleep  
Have you lost your will to speak  
Was the earth spinning round  
Were you falling through the ground  
As the world came tumbling down  
You prayed to God what have we done  
  
Free me from these chains I need to change my way  
Heal these broken wings I need to fly far away, far away, far away  
  
Was it emptiness that made you weep  
No more secrets to keep  
Was it bitterness that gave you time  
To forgive your sins  
Was the earth spinning round  
Were you falling through the ground  
As the world came tumbling down  
You prayed to God what have we done  
  
Free me from these chains I need to change my way  
Heal these broken wings I need to fly far away  
Free me from these thoughts long forgotten down below  
Take these angel's words give them life to carry on, carry on, carry on  
Free me from these chains

Thought you'd be forever the same  
When did you become so easy to change?  
Can't like who I want  
No, that's not true  
  
I do know  
Just can't figure out how to pin down  
There will be no unguarded kisses,  
Let go of my hand when they're around  
  
They say I'm unsound  
But what do they know?  
They can't figure out how to get down  
  
Soon enough I won't care  
Stay in my arms, if you dare  
You can't romanticize  
They are crazy  
  
Will only let you down  
Try to figure out, how to keep you down  
They're all alone  
I will keep you down

It's never gonna be  
Normal, you and me  
What you're signing on for  
Is a storm at sea  
  
So if you think you're tough  
Give me all your love  
And I'll give you every little piece of me  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
We will never be a nuclear family  
But a rainbow will begin at our feet  
And if you take my hand  
Beware that this boat can  
Run aground making the ocean floor weep  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Catch a falling star you'll go far  
In the pageant of the bizarre  
And tonight I give you my heart  
  
Take a chance on me, yeah  
You're my remedy, yeah  
  
You may fall indeed, yeah  
You'll find peace with me, yeah  
  
Take a chance on me, yeah  
You're my remedy, yeah  
  
You may fall indeed, yeah  
You'll find peace with me, yeah  
Peace with me, yeah  
  
Take a chance on me, yeah  
You're my remedy, yeah  
  
You may fall indeed, yeah  
You'll find peace with me, yeah

Now that you're older  
Taking the time to look  
Back over your shoulder  
On the days confusion took  
  
Now that you're wiser  
Surely you've learned to read it  
You should know  
No surface shines brighter  
Than the light that burns beneath it  
  
Never so sure  
We always take more  
Though we still don't know what it's for  
  
Now that I've seen you  
Stripped to the very core  
I know that I need you  
Less than I did before  
  
Never so sure  
We always take more  
Though we still don't know what it's for

Blossom lipped ladies and men with a gleam in their eyes  
Fat happy babies sit on their born thin mother's thighs  
Picture a vow  
Picture well  
  
I couldn't see the cracks in this fine social scene  
I couldn't find the fault with this whole pantomime  
  
All others laughing the jokes by the host  
He's no man  
  
All others dancing in couples to these session bands  
Wearing smiles  
Hot colt 45s  
  
I couldn't see the cracks in this fine social scene  
I couldn't find the fault with this whole pantomime

Another child is born  
Another race is won  
Another dream is shattered  
Another day has begun  
  
This world is still afloat  
No not in Noah's boat  
We've only lost the vision  
Of the stars we're meant to be  
  
Another broken heart  
Another lesson learnt  
Another harvest eaten  
Another night is gone  
A new day's begun  
Even your dreams they can be real  
  
This world is still afloat  
No not in Noah's boat  
We've only lost the vision  
Of the stars we're meant to be  
  
This world is still afloat  
No not in Noah's boat  
We've only lost the vision  
Of the stars we're meant to be  
  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope  
This world is full of love  
We still have hope

Try talking to you  
While you do, while you do  
I swap places with you  
Just to see things through  
Just sing me the tune  
And you'll see  
I'll keep it here for you  
I'll wait for your cue  
  
You wrote down all the words  
Black and white  
On a wall  
Just keepin' it so  
Yeah you know how it goes  
No plans for a change, nothing strange  
No not today no way  
Now sing me the tune  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
So you twist and you turn  
Uncomfortable fool, you'll never learn  
But you can take a stand  
Forget all about the plans California rose  
  
Side one track two  
On a record of you  
I've even stuck on a groove  
That I don't wanna lose  
Just play it again, as a friend  
It's your favorite worn-in shoes  
Now sing me the tune  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away, yeah  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
So you crash, and you burn  
Sometimes the road will twist and turn  
Some of this, less of that  
Forget all about the map California road  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away, yeah  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway  
  
Cash it in and throw it all away  
Never needed any of it anyway

Sirens sounding out, are we going to war  
A film of yesterday on a broken down door  
Send me something real to ignore or explore  
And I'll show you all the things that I saw  
  
Today  
The words don't mean enough for us to say  
For us to say  
Today  
To steal the moment that we gave away  
We gave away  
Gave it away  
  
Can't remember when, but it's happened before  
Saw it all played out through a crack in the door  
Send me something good for the way that I feel  
And I'll show you all the things that I've seen  
  
Today  
The words don't mean enough for us to say  
For us to say  
today  
To steal the moment that we gave away  
We gave away  
  
Today  
We are the light that travels into space  
Into space  
  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space  
We are the light that travels into space

It's just a day like any other day  
A beautiful day for an accident, let's say  
Yes it's just a day, like any other day  
Just one step closer to the end of the buffet  
La la la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting to die  
  
Now it's a good time for a tasty glass of wine  
Let's not burden our minds with carbon dioxide  
And everyone hurry, don't sit and abide  
Yes, everyone stand up, we're running out of time  
La la la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting here to die  
  
Look what a terrible mess that we've made  
The sun beats us down as we search for the shade  
And, yes, it is true, death is everyone's fate  
But we've made it this far, it's time to celebrate  
La la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting here to die  
La la la la la  
La la la la, 'cause we're waiting here to die

Faith sealer  
I don't feel you  
Don't hear you speak  
  
Maybe  
Someone else will  
Help you to see  
  
Warm sound  
Falling slowly  
Takes the time away from me  
Warm sound  
Feeling no pain  
Taking the time away from me  
  
Fake feeler  
I see through you  
With my eyes closed  
  
Warm sound  
Falling slowly  
Takes the time away from me  
Warm sound  
Feeling no pain  
Taking the time away from me  
  
They can't tell me  
What they can't see  
How it feels here  
Just how it feels here  
Just how it feels here

You take a stroll into the morning sun  
You make a Happy Meal a portion for one  
  
You steal the wallet of a man with a gun  
You make this seem like a whole lot of fun  
Yeah you do  
  
You'll make new shapes with your hands on a wall  
You're driving a nail while you're taking a call  
You wouldn't care if you had nothing at all  
Instead of chasing the dream  
You're just chasing a ball  
Yeah you are  
  
You're just dodging all the friendly fire  
You're never dressed in the right attire  
You miss the start of every game  
You're my flame  
  
You make hay when the sun don't shine  
You don't need a dollar, you don't need a dime  
You burn at both ends yet still you're fine  
You're my flame  
  
Teach me to haggle  
I'll teach you to swim  
Get right back on the saddle  
Push me on a swing  
  
Take me to Rio  
I'll take you to Berlin  
I'll give you some yarn  
And you'll give it some spin  
Yes you will  
  
Now you're sitting sure, yes, in an old tree  
You've tied our legs, and so now we have three  
You dip your toes into the ice cold sea  
I see your reflection, your reflection is me  
Yes I am  
  
You're just dodging all the friendly fire  
You're never dressed in the right attire  
You miss the start of every game  
You're my flame  
  
You make hay when the sun don't shine  
You don't need a dollar, you don't need a dime  
You burn at both ends yet still you're fine  
You're my flame  
  
You're my flame  
You're my flame  
You're my flame  
  
You're my flame  
You're my flame  
You're my flame
