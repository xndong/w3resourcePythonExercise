You're 'bout your money so you're probably working overtime huh?  
'Cause that minimum wage just ain't enough  
Long as your'e getting it, more power to ya  
Make a nigga wanna be the guy to give it to ya  
Long as you're not sitting up on your ass  
That'll make a real man say hallelujah!  
You got a son and you're raising him by yourself  
You need a real one in your life  
It ain't no probably, it's obvious that  
Your baby daddy didn't do you right  
I got a mama, girl I know how to treat a woman  
I like dessert, girl I know to eat a woman  
Lay with it, then play with it, I beat it up  
I know I'm sinning but before I eat it I'll say my grace in it (What)

Girl, I'll do it to ya, do it to ya  
Eat it, beat it, bang like ah!  
  
I'm going down on you first  
The real definition of down to earth  
I ain't the one you ask to buy you a purse  
I'm the one to make your insides hurt  
From the back with your face in the pillow  
From that position I know that you can only take a little  
But missionary she can take the whole thang  
It's so good I have her screaming out my government name  
And she ain't never got to tell me how she want it  
I'm a real one baby, I'm already knowing  
She said her nigga's shit's weak  
'Cause he ain't make her nut and they was fucking 'til the morning  
You know it fire when she's telling you to nut in her  
But I'm a nigga, I'm thinking something up with her  
I know the homies might think a nigga's krazy  
But you could fuck around and have my first baby  
What?  
  
Annie, girl, let's play house  
And you can show me what that's 'bout  
Girl, nobody beat the pussy up like me  
Who you know that beat the pussy up like me?  
Girl, I'm gonna lay you on your back  
Bam-bam, beat it like that  
I'mma do it to ya, do it to ya

We both tryna 69 and some more time  
My girl tryna FaceTime hitting both lines

First, you find a house and scope it out  
Find a Chinese neighborhood, cause they don't believe in bank accounts  
Second, you find a crew and a driver, someone ring the doorbell  
And someone that ain't scared to do what it do  
Third, you pull up at the spot  
Park, watch, ring the doorbell and knock  
Four, make sure nobody is home  
They gone, okay it's on  
Don't be scared, nigga, you're in now  
If the police come you gonna find out who your friends now  
That ain't them talking, that's your mind playing tricks on you  
You're conscious cause you know you got nines with two clips on you  
But fuck that, motherfuck that plasma  
And fuck that laptop, go and get that jewelry box  
You tryna get paid?  
Go take that jewelry box to the Slauson they'll give you cash back

Make some noise if you've ever stole something in your life  
Don't be ashamed, it's okay, baby  
Make some noise if you've ever stole a dollar out your mama's purse  
  
Niggas don't know the history 'bout the fly  
Put the flathead in the door, pull it, make it go fly  
Hit the first drawer, grab a nigga some socks

OVO crew, nigga, thought I told you  
If you a player in the game, this should hold you  
And man shout my nigga Game he just rolled through  
Eatin' crab out in Malibu at Nobu  
A lot of fools puttin' salt in the game  
Until these women get the notion that they runnin' the game  
They got money that they jumpin' on the pole to make  
Did the motto, took a flight to the golden state  
I'm the general, just makin' sure my soldiers straight  
Had to leave my nigga, homie got an open case  
But I'm big on the west like I'm big in the south  
So we gon' pay some people off, we gon' figure it out
