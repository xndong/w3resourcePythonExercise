I loved you for a long, long time  
I know this love is real  
It don't matter how it all went wrong  
That don't change the way I feel  
And I can't believe that time's  
Gonna heal this wound I'm speaking of  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
I'm aching for you baby  
I can't pretend I'm not  
I need to see you naked  
In your body and your thought  
I've got you like a habit  
And I'll never get enough  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
  
There ain't no cure for love  
There ain't no cure for love  
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky  
The holy books are open wide  
The doctors working day and night  
But they'll never ever find that cure for love  
There ain't no drink no drug  
(Ah tell them, angels)  
There's nothing pure enough to be a cure for love  
  
I see you in the subway and I see you on the bus  
I see you lying down with me, I see you waking up  
I see your hand, I see your hair  
Your bracelets and your brush  
And I call to you, I call to you  
But I don't call soft enough  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
  
I walked into this empty church I had no place else to go  
When the sweetest voice I ever heard, whispered to my soul  
I don't need to be forgiven for loving you so much  
It's written in the scriptures  
It's written there in blood  
I even heard the angels declare it from above  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure,  
There ain't no cure for love  
  
There ain't no cure for love  
There ain't no cure for love  
All the rocket ships are climbing through the sky  
The holy books are open wide  
The doctors working day and night  
But they'll never ever find that cure,  
That cure for love

(Oh friends, don't matter if you're a man or a woman. If you're in love  
with somebody, these are the words that you got to learn to say. Now  
listen carefully. Here it comes)  
I'll be loving you always  
with a love that's true, always  
When the thing you've planned  
needs my helping hand,  
I will understand, always, always  
  
Days may not be fair, always  
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year, but always.  
  
I said that I'll be loving you, always  
with a love that's true, always.  
When the thing you've planned  
needs my helping hand,  
I will, I will understand, always, always  
  
(Oh that's pretty  
that's pretty too  
Oh darling)  
  
The days may not be fair, always  
Yeah but that's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just a second, or a minute, or an hour,  
Not for just a weekend and a shake down in the shower,  
Not for just the summer and the winter going sour,  
But always, always, always  
  
(OK if you don't want to quit, let's try it one more time)  
  
I'll be loving you, always  
with a love that's true, always.  
When the thing you've planned  
needs my helping hand,  
I will understand, I will, I will understand, always, always  
  
The days may not be fair, always  
(Don't worry, baby)  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour,  
Not for just a day,  
Not for just a year, but always.

The birds they sang  
At the break of day  
Start again  
I heard them say  
Don't dwell on what  
Has passed away  
Or what is yet to be.  
Ah the wars they will  
Be fought again  
The holy dove  
She will be caught again  
Bought and sold  
And bought again  
The dove is never free.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack in everything  
That's how the light gets in.  
  
We asked for signs  
The signs were sent  
The birth betrayed  
The marriage spent  
Yeah the widowhood  
Of every government  
Signs for all to see.  
  
I can't run no more  
With that lawless crowd  
While the killers in high places  
Say their prayers out loud.  
But they've summoned, they've summoned up  
A thundercloud  
And they're going to hear from me.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
  
You can add up the parts  
But you won't have the sum  
You can strike up the march,  
There is no drum  
Every heart, every heart  
To love will come  
But like a refugee.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack, a crack in everything  
That's how the light gets in.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack, a crack in everything  
That's how the light gets in.  
That's how the light gets in.  
That's how the light gets in.

Like a bird on the wire,  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir  
I have tried in my way to be free.  
Like a worm on a hook,  
Like a knight from some old fashioned book  
I have saved all my ribbons for thee.  
If I, if I have been unkind,  
I hope that you can just let it go by.  
If I, if I have been untrue  
I hope you know it was never to you.  
  
Like a baby, stillborn,  
Like a beast with his horn  
I have torn everyone who reached out for me.  
But I swear by this song  
And by all that I have done wrong  
I will make it all up to thee.  
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch,  
He said to me, "You must not ask for so much."  
And a pretty woman leaning in her darkened door,  
She cried to me, "Hey, why not ask for more?"  
  
Oh like a bird on the wire,  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir have tried in my way to be free.

Ah we're drinking and we're dancing  
And the band is really happening  
And the johnny walker wisdom running high  
And my very sweet companion  
She's the angel of compassion  
She's rubbing half the world against her thigh  
And every drinker every dancer  
Lifts a happy face to thank her  
The fiddler fiddles something so sublime  
All the women tear their blouses off  
And the men they dance on the polka-dots  
And it's partner found, it's partner lost  
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:  
It's closing time  
Yeah the women tear their blouses off  
And the men they dance on the polka-dots  
And it's partner found, it's partner lost  
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops:  
It's closing time  
  
Ah we're lonely, we're romantic  
And the cider's laced with acid  
And the holy spirit's crying, "where's the beef?"  
And the moon is swimming naked  
And the summer night is fragrant  
With a mighty expectation of relief  
So we struggle and we stagger  
Down the snakes and up the ladder  
To the tower where the blessed hours chime  
And I swear it happened just like this:  
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss  
The gates of love they budged an inch  
I can't say much has happened since  
But closing time  
  
I swear it happened just like this:  
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss  
The gates of love they budged an inch  
I can't say much has happened since  
Closing time  
  
I loved you for your beauty  
But that doesn't make a fool of me:  
You were in it for your beauty too  
And I loved you for your body  
There's a voice that sounds like god to me  
Declaring, declaring, declaring that your body's really you  
And I loved you when our love was blessed  
And I love you now there's nothing left  
But sorrow and a sense of overtime  
And I missed you since the place got wrecked  
And I just don't care what happens next  
Looks like freedom but it feels like death  
It's something in between, I guess  
It's closing time  
  
Yeah I missed you since the place got wrecked  
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex  
Looks like freedom but it feels like death  
It's something in between, I guess  
It's closing time  
  
Yeah we're drinking and we're dancing  
But there's nothing really happening  
And the place is dead as heaven on a Saturday night  
And my very close companion  
Gets me fumbling gets me laughing  
She's a hundred but she's wearing  
Something tight  
And I lift my glass to the awful truth  
Which you can't reveal to the ears of youth  
Except to say it isn't worth a dime  
And the whole damn place goes crazy twice  
And it's once for the devil and once for christ  
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights  
We're busted in the blinding lights,  
Busted in the blinding lights  
Of closing time  
  
The whole damn place goes crazy twice  
And it's once for the devil and once for christ  
But the boss don't like these dizzy heights  
We're busted in the blinding lights,  
Busted in the blinding lights  
Of closing time  
  
Oh the women tear their blouses off  
And the men they dance on the polka-dots  
It's closing time  
And it's partner found, it's partner lost  
And it's hell to pay when the fiddler stops  
It's closing time  
I swear it happened just like this:  
A sigh, a cry, a hungry kiss  
It's closing time  
The gates of love they budged an inch  
I can't say much has happened since  
But closing time  
I loved you when our love was blessed  
I love you now there's nothing left  
But closing time  
I miss you since the place got wrecked  
By the winds of change and the weeds of sex.

(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Angels) You can't do this  
You must do what  
We must do what must be done  
  
(Judy) I hear my baby calling  
He is asking to be born  
I see the curtains parting  
That our kisses have outworn...  
  
(Angels) Kisses all outworn...  
  
(Judy) I'll raise a tent of shelter  
Now though every thread is torn  
  
(Angels) Every thread is torn...  
  
(Judy) I take my life from realms of light  
And hang it on a thorn  
  
(Angels) Hanging on a thorn...  
  
(Judy) I hear the children calling  
Asking to be born  
I see the curtains parting  
And my life upon a thorn  
  
The stars have lost their fire  
And the moon has lost her voice  
And I'm coming back to find you  
I have made the human choice.  
  
(Angels) You've made your choice  
The world you choose  
Garlands of planets and starlight  
Now you lose  
  
(Judy) He's the only one who knows me  
He's the riddle of my life  
And they'll never tell the story  
Of the husband and the wife  
  
(Angels) The world she chooses, she loses...  
  
(Judy) He's the stone that broke my heart  
The foundation of my home --  
  
(Angels) This we must do!  
  
(Judy) He's the sweetness of the sweetness  
Of the sweetness honeycomb  
  
(Angels) We must do what we must do!  
  
(Judy) And he's welcome to his glory  
And he's buried in my life  
And they'll never tell the story  
Of the husband and the wife  
  
(Angels) She takes her life from realms of light  
  
(Valkyries) She hangs it on a thorn  
  
(Angels) She disobeys the law  
  
(Valkyries) The law is broken  
You must get them  
  
(Angels) Get him.  
  
(Valkyries) Get them!  
  
Messenger  
Listen  
Messenger  
Do what must be done  
And our will be done  
Will be done

The woman in blue, she's asking for revenge,  
The man in white -- that's you -- says he has no friends.  
The river is swollen up with rusty cans  
  
And the trees are burning in your promised land.  
And there are no letters in the mailbox,  
And there are no grapes upon the vine,  
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore,  
And there are no diamonds in the mine.  
  
Well, you tell me that your lover has a broken limb,  
You say you're kind of restless now and it's on account of him.  
Well, I saw the man in question, it was just the other night,  
He was eating up a lady where the lions and Christians fight.  
  
And there are no letters in the mailbox  
And there are no grapes upon the vine,  
And there are no chocolates in the boxes anymore,  
And there are no diamonds in the mine.  
  
(You tell them now)  
  
Ah, there is no comfort in the covens of the witch,  
Some very clever doctor went and sterilized the bitch,  
And the only man of energy, yes the revolution's pride,  
He trained a hundred women just to kill an unborn child.  
  
And there are no letters in the mailbox,  
Oh no, there are no, no grapes upon your vine,  
  
And there are, there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore,  
And there are no diamonds in your mine.  
And there are no letters in the mailbox,  
And there are no grapes upon the vine,  
And there are no chocolates in your boxes anymore,  
And there are no diamonds in your mine.

Four o'clock in the afternoon  
And I didn't feel like very much.  
I said to myself, "Where are you golden boy,  
Where is your famous golden touch?"  
I thought you knew where  
All of the elephants lie down,  
I thought you were the crown prince  
Of all the wheels in Ivory Town.  
  
Just take a look at your body now,  
There's nothing much to save  
And a bitter voice in the mirror cries,  
"Hey, Prince, you need a shave."  
  
Now if you can manage to get  
Your trembling fingers to behave,  
Why don't you try unwrapping  
A stainless steel razor blade?  
  
That's right, it's come to this,  
Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
There's no hot water  
And the cold is running thin.  
Well, what do you expect from  
The kind of places you've been living in?  
  
Don't drink from that cup,  
It's all caked and cracked along the rim.  
That's not the electric light, my friend,  
That is your vision growing dim.  
  
Cover up your face with soap, there,  
Now you're Santa Claus.  
And you've got a gift for anyone  
Who will give you his applause.  
  
I thought you were a racing man,  
Ah, but you couldn't take the pace.  
That's a funeral in the mirror  
And it's stopping at your face.  
  
That's right, it's come to this,  
Yes it's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Ah wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
Once there was a path  
And a girl with chestnut hair,  
And you passed the summers  
Picking all of the berries that grew there  
There were times she was a woman,  
Oh, there were times she was just a child,  
And you held her in the shadows  
Where the raspberries grow wild.  
  
And you climbed the twilight mountains  
And you sang about the view,  
And everywhere that you wandered  
Love seemed to go along with you.  
That's a hard one to remember,  
Yes it makes you clench your fist.  
  
And then the veins stand out like highways,  
All along your wrist.  
And yes it's come to this,  
It's come to this,  
And wasn't it a long way down,  
Wasn't it a strange way down?  
  
You can still find a job,  
Go out and talk to a friend.  
On the back of every magazine  
There are those coupons you can send.  
Why don't you join the Rosicrucians,  
They can give you back your hope,  
You can find your love with diagrams  
On a plain brown envelope.  
  
But you've used up all your coupons  
Except the one that seems  
To be written on your wrist  
Along with several thousand dreams.  
  
Now Santa Claus comes forward,  
That's a razor in his mit  
And he puts on his dark glasses  
And he shows you where to hit  
And then the cameras pan,  
The stand in stunt man,  
Dress rehearsal rag,  
It's just the dress rehearsal rag,  
You know this dress rehearsal rag,  
It's just a dress rehearsal rag.

Everybody knows that the dice are loaded  
Everybody rolls with their fingers crossed  
Everybody knows that the war is over  
Everybody knows the good guys lost  
Everybody knows the fight was fixed  
The poor stay poor, the rich get rich  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that the boat is leaking  
Everybody knows that the captain lied  
Everybody got this broken feeling  
Like their father or their dog just died  
  
Everybody talking to their pockets  
Everybody wants a box of chocolates  
And a long stem rose  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows that you love me baby  
Everybody knows that you really do  
Everybody knows that you've been faithful  
Ah give or take a night or two  
Everybody knows you've been discreet  
But there were so many people you just had to meet  
Without your clothes  
And everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows, everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows, everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
And everybody knows that it's now or never  
Everybody knows that it's me or you  
And everybody knows that you live forever  
Ah when you've done a line or two  
Everybody knows the deal is rotten  
Old Black Joe's still pickin' cotton  
For your ribbons and bows  
And everybody knows  
  
And everybody knows that the Plague is coming  
Everybody knows that it's moving fast  
Everybody knows that the naked man and woman  
Are just a shining artifact of the past  
Everybody knows the scene is dead  
But there's gonna be a meter on your bed  
That will disclose  
What everybody knows  
  
And everybody knows that you're in trouble  
Everybody knows what you've been through  
From the bloody cross on top of Calvary  
To the beach of Malibu  
Everybody knows it's coming apart  
Take one last look at this Sacred Heart  
Before it blows  
And everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows, everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Oh everybody knows, everybody knows  
That's how it goes  
Everybody knows  
  
Everybody knows

Now I greet you from the other side of sorrow and despair, with a love so vast  
And so shattered, it will reach you everywhere.  
  
And I sing this for the captain whose ship has not been built, for the mother
in  
Confusion, her cradle still unfilled.  
  
For the heart with no companion, for the soul without a king. for the prima  
Ballerina who cannot dance to anything.  
  
Through the days of shame that are coming, through the nights of wild
distress,  
Though your promise count for nothing, you must keep it nonetheless.  
  
You must keep it for the captain whose ship has not been built. for the mother
in  
Confusion her cradle still unfilled.  
  
For the heart with no companion, for the soul without a king, for the prima  
Ballerina who cannot dance to anything.

Your father's gone a-hunting  
He's lost in the forest so wild  
And he cannot take his wife with him  
He cannot take his child  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
Through the quicksand and the clay  
And a woman cannot follow him  
Although she knows the way  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
Through the silver and the glass  
Where only greed can enter  
But spirit, spirit cannot pass  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
For the beast he cannot bind  
And he leaves a baby sleeping  
And his blessings all behind  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
And he's lost his lucky charm  
And he's lost the guardian heart  
That keeps the hunter the harm  
  
Your father's gone a-hunting  
He asked me to say goodbye  
And he warned me not to stop him  
I wouldn't, I wouldn't even try

I stumbled out of bed  
I got ready for the struggle  
I smoked a cigarette  
And I tightened up my gut  
I said this can't be me  
Must be my double  
And I can't forget, I can't forget  
I can't forget but I don't remember what  
I'm burning up the road  
I'm heading down to Phoenix  
I got this old address  
Of someone that I knew  
It was high and fine and free  
Ah, you should have seen us  
And I can't forget, I can't forget  
I can't forget but I don't remember who  
  
I'll be there today  
With a big bouquet of cactus  
I got this rig that runs on memories  
And I promise, cross my heart,  
They'll never catch us  
But if they do, just tell them it was me  
  
Yeah I loved you all my life  
And that's how I want to end it  
The summer's almost gone  
The winter's tuning up  
Yeah, the summer's gone  
But a lot goes on forever  
And I can't forget, I can't forget  
I can't forget but I don't remember what

I left a woman waiting  
I met her sometime later  
She said, I see your eyes are dead  
What happened to you, lover?  
What happened to you, my lover?  
What happened to you, lover?  
What happened to you?  
  
And since she spoke the truth to me  
I tried to answer truthfully  
Whatever happened to my eyes  
Happened to your beauty  
Happened to your beauty  
What happened to your beauty  
Happened to me  
  
We took ourselves to someone's bed  
And there we fell together  
Quick as dogs and truly dead were we  
And free as running water  
Free as running water  
Free as running water  
Free as you and me  
The way it's got to be  
The way it's got to be, lover

I tried to leave you, I don't deny  
I closed the book on us, at least a hundred times.  
I'd wake up every morning by your side.  
  
The years go by, you lose your pride.  
The baby's crying, so you do not go outside,  
And all your work it's right before your eyes.  
  
Goodnight, my darling, I hope you're satisfied,  
The bed is kind of narrow, but my arms are open wide.  
And here's a man still working for your smile.

If the sun would lose its light  
And we lived an endless night  
And there was nothing left that you could feel  
That's how it would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didn't have your love to make it real  
  
If the stars were all unpinned  
And a cold and bitter wind  
Swallowed up the world without a trace  
Ah, well that's where I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I couldn't lift the veil and see your face  
And if no leaves were on the tree  
And no water in the sea  
And the break of day had nothing to reveal  
That's how broken I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didn't have your love to make it real  
If the sun would lose its light  
And we lived in an endless night  
And there was nothing left that you could feel  
If the sea were sand alone  
And the flowers made of stone  
And no one that you hurt could ever heal  
Well that's how broken I would be  
What my life would seem to me  
If I didn't have your love to make it real

If it be your will  
That I speak no more  
And my voice be still  
As it was before  
I will speak no more  
I shall abide until  
I am spoken for  
If it be your will  
If it be your will  
That a voice be true  
From this broken hill  
I will sing to you  
From this broken hill  
All your praises they shall ring  
If it be your will  
To let me sing  
From this broken hill  
All your praises they shall ring  
If it be your will  
To let me sing  
  
If it be your will  
If there is a choice  
Let the rivers fill  
Let the hills rejoice  
Let your mercy spill  
On all these burning hearts in hell  
If it be your will  
To make us well  
  
And draw us near  
And bind us tight  
All your children here  
In their rags of light  
In our rags of light  
All dressed to kill  
And end this night  
If it be your will  
  
If it be your will

I saw you this morning.  
You were moving so fast.  
Can't seem to loosen my grip  
On the past.  
And I miss you so much.  
There's no one in sight.  
And we're still making love  
In My Secret Life.  
  
I smile when I'm angry.  
I cheat and I lie.  
I do what I have to do  
To get by.  
But I know what is wrong,  
And I know what is right.  
And I'd die for the truth  
In My Secret Life.  
  
Hold on, hold on, my brother.  
My sister, hold on tight.  
I finally got my orders.  
I'll be marching through the morning,  
Marching through the night,  
Moving cross the borders  
Of My Secret Life.  
  
Looked through the paper.  
Makes you want to cry.  
Nobody cares if the people  
Live or die.  
And the dealer wants you thinking  
That it's either black or white.  
Thank G-d it's not that simple  
In My Secret Life.  
  
I bite my lip.  
I buy what I'm told:  
From the latest hit,  
To the wisdom of old.  
But I'm always alone.  
And my heart is like ice.  
And it's crowded and cold  
In My Secret Life.

I needed you, I knew I was in danger  
Of losing what I used to think was mine  
You let me love you till I was a failure,  
You let me love you till I was a failure  
Your beauty on my bruise like iodine  
I asked you if a man could be forgiven  
And though I failed at love, was this a crime?  
You said, Don't worry, don't worry, darling  
You said, Don't worry, don't you worry, darling  
There are many ways a man can serve his time  
  
You covered up that place I could not master  
It wasn't dark enough to shut my eyes  
So I was with you, O sweet compassion  
Yes I was with you, O sweet compassion  
Compassion with the sting of iodine  
  
Your saintly kisses reeked of iodine  
Your fragrance with a fume of iodine  
And pity in the room like iodine  
  
Your sister fingers burned like iodine  
And all my wanton lust was iodine  
My masquerade of trust was iodine  
And everywhere the flare of iodine

You were the promise at dawn  
I was the morning after  
You were Jesus Christ my Lord  
I was the money lender  
You were the sensitive woman  
I was the very reverend Freud  
You were the manual orgasm  
I was the dirty little boy  
  
And is this what you wanted  
To live in a house that is haunted  
By the ghost of you and me?  
  
Is this what you wanted...  
You were Marlon Brando  
I was Steve Mcqueen  
You were k.y. jelly  
I was vaseline  
You were the father of modern medicine  
I was Mr. Clean  
You where the whore and the beast of Babylon  
I was Rin Tin Tin  
  
And is this what you wanted...  
And is this what you wanted...  
You got old and wrinkled  
I stayed seventeen  
You lusted after so many  
I lay here with one  
You defied your solitude  
I came through alone  
You said you could never love me  
I undid your gown  
  
And is this what you wanted...  
And is this what you wanted...  
I mean is this what you wanted...  
That's right, is this what you wanted...

Seemed the better way  
When first I heard him speak  
Now it's much too late  
To turn the other cheek  
Sounded like the truth  
Seemed the better way  
Sounded like the truth  
But it's not the truth today  
  
I wonder what it was  
I wonder what it meant  
First he touched on love  
Then he touched on death  
Sounded like the truth  
Seemed the better way  
Sounded like the truth  
But it's not the truth today  
I better hold my tongue  
I better take my place  
Lift this glass of blood  
Try to say the grace  
  
Seemed the better way  
When first I heard him speak  
But now it's much too late  
To turn the other cheek  
Sounded like the truth  
Seemed the better way  
Sounded like the truth  
But it's not the truth today  
  
I better hold my tongue  
I better take my place  
Lift this glass of blood  
Try to say the grace

Alas, my love, you did me wrong,  
To cast me out discourteously,  
For I have loved you so long,  
Delighting in your very company.  
Now if you intend to show me disdain,  
Don't you know it all the more enraptures me,  
For even so I still remain your lover in captivity.  
Green sleeves, you're all alone,  
The leaves have fallen, the men have gone.  
Green sleeves, there's no one home,  
Not even the Lady Green Sleeves  
  
I sang my songs, I told my lies,  
To lie between your matchless thighs.  
And ain't it fine, ain't it wild  
To finally end our exercise  
Then I saw you naked in the early dawn,  
Oh, I hoped you would be someone new.  
I reached for you but you were gone,  
So lady I'm going too.  
  
Green sleeves, you're all alone  
  
Green sleeves, you're all alone,  
The leaves have fallen, the men have all gone home.  
Green sleeves, it's so easily done,  
Leaving the Lady Green Sleeves.

I'm leaving the table  
I'm out of the game  
I don't know the people  
In your picture frame  
If I ever loved you or no, no  
It's a crying shame if I ever loved you  
If I knew your name  
You don't need a lawyer  
I'm not making a claim  
You don't need to surrender  
I'm not taking aim  
  
I don't need a lover, no, no  
The wretched beast is tame  
I don't need a lover  
So blow out the flame  
  
There's nobody missing  
There is no reward  
Little by little  
We're cutting the cord  
We're spending the treasure, oh, no, no  
That love cannot afford  
I know you can feel it  
The sweetness restored  
  
I don't need a reason  
For what I became  
I've got these excuses  
They're tired and lame  
I don't need a pardon, no, no, no, no, no  
There's no one left to blame  
I'm leaving the table  
I'm out of the game  
  
I'm leaving the table  
I'm out of the game

She stands before you naked  
You can see it, you can taste it,  
And she comes to you light as the breeze.  
Now you can drink it or you can nurse it,  
It don't matter how you worship  
As long as you're  
Down on your knees.  
So I knelt there at the delta,  
At the alpha and the omega,  
At the cradle of the river and the seas.  
And like a blessing come from heaven  
For something like a second  
I was healed and my heart  
Was at ease.  
  
O baby I waited  
So long for your kiss  
For something to happen,  
Oh something like this.  
  
And you're weak and you're harmless  
And you're sleeping in your harness  
And the wind going wild  
In the trees,  
And it ain't exactly prison  
But you'll never be forgiven  
For whatever you've done  
With the keys.  
  
O baby I waited  
  
It's dark now and it's snowing  
O my love I must be going,  
The river has started to freeze.  
And I'm sick of pretending  
I'm broken from bending  
I've lived too long on my knees.  
  
Then she dances so graceful  
And your heart's hard and hateful  
And she's naked  
But that's just a tease.  
And you turn in disgust  
From your hatred and from your love  
And comes to you  
Light as the breeze.  
  
O baby I waited  
  
There's blood on every bracelet  
You can see it, you can taste it,  
And it's please baby  
Please baby please.  
And she says, drink deeply, pilgrim  
But don't forget there's still a woman  
Beneath this  
Resplendent chemise.  
  
So I knelt there at the delta,  
At the alpha and the omega,  
I knelt there like one who believes.  
And the blessings come from heaven  
And for something like a second  
I'm cured and my heart  
Is at ease

The light came through the window,  
Straight from the sun above,  
And so inside my little room  
There plunged the rays of Love.  
  
In streams of light I clearly saw  
The dust you seldom see,  
Out of which the Nameless makes  
A Name for one like me.  
  
I'll try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love Itself  
Love Itself was gone.  
  
All busy in the sunlight  
The flecks did float and dance,  
And I was tumbled up with them  
In formless circumstance.  
  
I'll try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love Itself  
Love Itself was gone.  
  
Then I came back from where I'd been.  
My room, it looked the same  
But there was nothing left between  
The Nameless and the Name.  
  
All busy in the sunlight  
The flecks did float and dance,  
And I was tumbled up with them  
In formless circumstance.  
  
I'll try to say a little more  
Love went on and on  
Until it reached an open door  
Then Love itself,  
Love Itself was gone.  
Love Itself was gone.

I asked my father  
I said, "Father change my name"  
The one I'm using now it's covered up  
With fear and filth and cowardice and shame  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Yes and lover, lover, lover  
Lover, lover, lover, lover  
Come back to me  
  
He said, "I locked you in this body  
I meant it as a kind of trial  
You can use it for a weapon  
Or to make some woman smile"  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"Then let me start again," I cried  
"Please let me start again  
I want a face that's fair this time  
I want a spirit that is calm"  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"I never, never turned aside," he said  
"I never walked away  
It was you who built the temple  
it was you who covered up my face"  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And may the spirit of this song  
May it rise up pure and free  
May it be a shield for you  
A shield against the enemy  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Frankie Lane, he was singing Jezebel  
I pinned an Iron Cross to my lapel  
I walked up to the tallest and the blondest girl  
I said, Look, you don't know me now but very soon you will  
So won't you let me see  
I said "won't you let me see"  
I said "won't you let me see  
Your naked body?"  
  
Just dance me to the dark side of the gym  
Chances are I'll let you do most anything  
I know you're hungry, I can hear it in your voice  
And there are many parts of me to touch, you have your choice  
Ah but no you cannot see  
She said "no you cannot see"  
She said "no you cannot see  
My naked body"  
  
So We're dancing close, the band is playing Stardust  
Balloons and paper streamers floating down on us  
She says, You've got a minute left to fall in love  
In solemn moments such as this I have put my trust  
And all my faith to see  
I said all my faith to see  
I said all my faith to see  
Her naked body

No words this time?  
No words.  
No, there are times when nothing can be done.  
Not this time.  
Is it censorship?  
Is it censorship? No, it's evaporation.  
No, it's evaporation.  
Is this leading somewhere?  
Yes. We're going down the lane.  
Is this going somewhere?  
Into the garden.  
Into the backyard.  
We're walking down the driveway.  
Are we moving towards  
We're in the backyard, some transcendental moment?  
It's almost light. That's right. That's it.  
Are we moving towards some transcendental moment?  
That's right. That's it.  
Do you think you'll be able to pull it off?  
Yes. Do you think you can pull it off?  
Yes, it might happen. I'm all ears.  
I'm all ears. Oh the morning glory!

I went down to the place  
Where I knew she lay waiting  
Under the marble and the snow  
I said, Mother I'm frightened  
The thunder and the lightning  
I'll never come through this alone  
She said, I'll be with you  
My shawl wrapped around you  
My hand on your head when you go  
And the night came on  
It was very calm  
  
I wanted the night to go on and on  
But she said, Go back to the World  
We were fighting in Egypt  
When they signed this agreement  
That nobody else had to die  
There was this terrible sound  
And my father went down  
With a terrible wound in his side  
He said, Try to go on  
Take my books, take my gun  
Remember, my son, how they lied  
And the night comes on  
It's very calm  
I'd like to pretend that my father was wrong  
But you don't want to lie, not to the young  
  
We were locked in this kitchen  
I took to religion  
And I wondered how long she would stay  
I needed so much  
To have nothing to touch  
I've always been greedy that way  
But my son and my daughter  
Climbed out of the water  
Crying, Papa, you promised to play  
And they lead me away  
To the great surprise  
It's Papa, don't peek, Papa, cover your eyes  
And they hide, they hide in the World  
  
Now I look for her always  
I'm lost in this calling  
I'm tied to the threads of some prayer  
Saying, When will she summon me  
When will she come to me  
What must I do to prepare  
When she bends to my longing  
Like a willow, like a fountain  
She stands in the luminous air  
And the night comes on  
And it's very calm  
I lie in her arms and says, When I'm gone  
I'll be yours, yours for a song  
  
Now the crickets are singing  
The vesper bells ringing  
The cat's curled asleep in his chair  
I'll go down to Bill's Bar  
I can make it that far  
And I'll see if my friends are still there  
Yes, and here's to the few  
Who forgive what you do  
And the fewer who don't even care  
And the night comes on  
It's very calm  
I want to cross over, I want to go home  
But she says, Go back, go back to the World

I built my house beside the wood  
So I could hear you singing  
And it was sweet and it was good  
And love was all beginning  
Fare thee well my nightingale  
'Twas long ago I found you  
Now all your songs of beauty fail  
The forest closes 'round you  
The sun goes down behind a veil  
'Tis now that you would call me  
So rest in peace my nightingale  
Beneath your branch of holly  
Fare thee well my nightingale  
I lived but to be near you  
Tho' you are singing somewhere still  
I can no longer hear you  

Some people say  
It's what we deserve  
For sins against g-d  
For crimes in the world  
I wouldn't know  
I'm just holding the fort  
Since that day  
They wounded New York  
Some people say  
They hate us of old  
Our women unveiled  
Our slaves and our gold  
I wouldn't know  
I'm just holding the fort  
But answer me this  
I won't take you to court  
Did you go crazy  
Or did you report  
On that day  
On that day  
They wounded New York  

I knew that it was wrong  
I didn't have a doubt  
I was dying to get back home  
And you were starting out  
I said I'd best be moving on  
You said we have all day  
You smiled at me like I was young  
It took my breath away  
Your crazy fragrance all around  
Your secrets all in view  
My lost, my lost was saying found  
My don't was saying do  
  
Let's keep it on the level  
When I walked away from you  
I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel, too  
They oughta give my heart a medal  
For letting go of you  
When I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel, too  
  
Now I'm living in this temple  
Where they tell you what to do  
I'm old and I've had to settle  
On a different point of view  
I was fighting with temptation  
But I didn't want to win  
A man like me don't like to see  
Temptation caving in  
  
Your crazy fragrance all around  
Your secrets in my view  
My lost, my lost was saying found  
My don't was saying do  
  
Let's keep it on the level  
When I walked away from you  
I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel, too  
  
They oughta give my heart a medal  
For letting go of you  
When I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel, too  
  
They oughta give my heart a medal  
For letting go of you  
When I turned my back on the devil  
Turned my back on the angel, too

I lit a thin green candle to make you jealous of me,  
But the room just filled up with mosquitoes, they heard that my body was free  
Then I took the dust of a long sleepless night and I put it in your little
shoe  
And then I confess that I tortured the dress that you wore for the world to
look through  
  
I showed my heart to the doctor. He said I'd just have to quit  
Then he wrote himself a prescription, your name was mentioned in it  
Then he locked himself in a library shelf with the details of our honeymoon  
And I hear from the nurse that he's gotten much worse and his practice is all
in a ruin  
  
I heard of a saint who had loved you, I studied all night in his school  
He taught that the duty of lovers is to tarnish the golden rule  
And just when I was sure that his teachings were pure he drowned himself in
the pool  
His body is gone but back here on the lawn his spirit continues to drool  
  
An Eskimo showed me a movie he'd recently taken of you  
The poor man could hardly stop shivering, his lips and his fingers were blue  
I suppose that he froze when the wind tore off your clothes  
And I guess he just never got warm, but you stand there so nice in your
blizzard of ice  
Oh please let me come into the storm

The walls of this hotel are paper-thin  
Last night I heard you making love to him  
The struggle mouth to mouth and limb to limb  
The grunt of unity when he came in  
I stood there with my ear against the wall  
I was not seized by jealousy at all  
In fact a burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control  
A heavy burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control  
  
I listened to your kisses at the door  
I never heard the world so clear before  
You ran your bath and you began to sing  
I felt so good I couldn't feel a thing  
  
I stood there with my ear against the wall  
  
And I can't wait to tell you to your face  
And I can't wait for you to take my place  
You are The Naked Angel In My Heart  
You are The Woman With Her Legs Apart  
It's written on the walls of this hotel  
You go to heaven once you've been to hell  
  
A heavy burden lifted from my soul  
I heard that love was out of my control

I saw jesus on the cross on a hill called calvary  
"do you hate mankind for what they done to you? "  
He said, "talk of love not hate, things to do - it's getting late.  
I've so little time and I'm only passing through."  
Passing through, passing through.  
Sometimes happy, sometimes blue,  
Glad that I ran into you.  
Tell the people that you saw me passing through.  
I saw adam leave the garden with an apple in his hand,  
I said "now you're out, what are you going to do? "  
"plant some crops and pray for rain, maybe raise a little cane.  
I'm an orphan now, and I'm only passing through."  
Passing through, passing through ...  
I was with washington at valley ford, shivering in the snow.  
I said, "how come the men here suffer like they do? "  
"men will suffer, men will fight, even die for what is right  
Even though they know they're only passing through"  
Passing through, passing through ...  
I was with franklin roosevelt's side on the night before he died.  
He said, "one world must come out of world war two" (ah, the fool)  
"yankee, russian, white or tan," he said, "a man is still a man.  
We're all on one road, and we're only passing through."  
Passing through, passing through ...  
(let's do it one more time)  
Passing through, passing through ...  

Oh the sisters of mercy, they are not departed or gone.  
They were waiting for me when I thought that I just can't go on.  
And they brought me their comfort and later they brought me this song.  
Oh I hope you run into them, you who've been travelling so long.  
  
Yes you who must leave everything that you cannot control.  
It begins with your family, but soon it comes around to your soul.  
Well I've been where you're hanging, I think I can see how you're pinned:  
When you're not feeling holy, your loneliness says that you've sinned.  
  
Well they lay down beside me, I made my confession to them.  
They touched both my eyes and I touched the dew on their hem.  
If your life is a leaf that the seasons tear off and condemn  
They will bind you with love that is graceful and green as a stem.  
  
When I left they were sleeping, I hope you run into them soon.  
Don't turn on the lights, you can read their address by the moon.  
And you won't make me jealous if I hear that they sweetened your night:  
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right,  
We weren't lovers like that and besides it would still be all right.

Come over to the window, my little darling  
I'd like to try to read your palm  
I used to think I was some kind of Gypsy boy  
Before I let you take me home  
  
Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began  
To laugh and cry and cry and laugh about it all again  
  
Well you know that I love to live with you  
But you make me forget so very much  
I forget to pray for the angels  
And then the angels forget to pray for us  
  
Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began  
  
We met when we were almost young  
Deep in the green lilac park  
You held on to me like I was a crucifix  
As we went kneeling through the dark  
  
Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began  
  
Your letters they all say that you're beside me now  
Then why do I feel alone?  
I'm standing on a ledge and your fine spider web  
Is fastening my ankle to a stone  
  
Now so long, Marianne, it's time that we began  
  
For now I need your hidden love  
I'm cold as a new razor blade  
You left when I told you I was curious  
I never said that I was brave  
  
Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began  
  
Oh, you are really such a pretty one  
I see you've gone and changed your name again  
And just when I climbed this whole mountainside  
To wash my eyelids in the rain  
  
Oh so long, Marianne, it's time that we began

There was a child named Bernadette  
I heard the story long ago  
She saw the queen of heaven once  
And kept the vision in her soul  
No one believed what she had seen  
No one believed what she heard  
But there were sorrows to be healed  
And mercy, mercy in this world  
  
So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what we have done and can't undo  
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do  
  
We've been around, we fall, we fly  
We mostly fall, we mostly run  
And every now and then we try  
To mend the damage that we've done  
Tonight, tonight I just can't rest  
I've got this joy in my breast  
To Think that I did not forget that child  
That song of Bernadette  
  
So many hearts I find, broke like yours and mine  
Torn by what we've done and can't undo  
I just want to hold you, won't you let me hold you  
Like Bernadette would do

(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Michael) We were chosen, we were chosen  
Miles and miles apart  
I to love your kingdom  
You to love my heart  
  
(Angels) We were chosen  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
(Michael) The love is intermittent  
The discipline continues  
I work on your spirit  
You work on my sinews.  
  
(Angels) We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
We have fun 'cause  
We do what must  
What must be done  
  
(Michael) I watch myself from where you are  
Please do not be mistaken  
The spider web you see me through  
Is the view I've always taken  
  
  
Begin the ceremony now  
That we have been preparing  
I'm tired of this marble floor  
That we have both been sharing.  
  
(Angels) Now we will be sharing  
What he has been preparing!  
  
(Girls) He's the only one  
He's the only one  
He's the riddle of the music  
He's the music of my life  
  
(Boys) Now it begins  
Now it begins  
He's the riddle of the music  
He's the music of the sacrifice  
  
(Valkyries) Messenger  
Messenger  
Our will  
Will be done  
  
(Angels) We work on his sinews  
And the discipline continues  
  
(Everyone) Begin the ceremony  
Begin the sacrifice ...

Steer your way past the ruins of the Altar and the Mall  
Steer your way through the fables of Creation and The Fall  
Steer your way past the Palaces that rise above the rot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
Steer your heart past the Truth that you believed in yesterday  
Such as Fundamental Goodness and the Wisdom of the Way  
Steer your heart, precious heart, past the women whom you bought  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
Steer you way through the pain that is far more real than you  
That's smashed the Cosmic Model, that blinded every view  
And please don't make me go there, though there be a God or not  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
They whisper still, the injured stones  
The blunted mountains weep  
As he died to make men holy  
Let us die to make things cheap  
And say the Mea Culpa, which you probably forgot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
Steer your way, O my heart, though I have no right to ask  
To the one who was never, never equal to the task  
Who knows he's been convicted, who knows he will be shot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought  
  
They whisper still, the injured stones  
The blunted mountains weep  
As he died to make men holy  
Let us die to make things cheap  
And say the Mea Culpa, which you gradually forgot  
Year by year, month by month, day by day  
Thought by thought

The door it opened slowly,  
My father he came in,  
I was nine years old.  
And he stood so tall above me,  
His blue eyes they were shining  
And his voice was very cold.  
He said, "I've had a vision  
And you know I'm strong and holy,  
I must do what I've been told."  
So he started up the mountain,  
I was running, he was walking,  
And his axe was made of gold.  
  
Well, the trees they got much smaller,  
The lake a lady's mirror,  
We stopped to drink some wine.  
Then he threw the bottle over.  
Broke a minute later  
And he put his hand on mine.  
Thought I saw an eagle  
But it might have been a vulture,  
I never could decide.  
Then my father built an altar,  
He looked once behind his shoulder,  
He knew I would not hide.  
  
You who build these altars now  
To sacrifice these children,  
You must not do it anymore.  
A scheme is not a vision  
And you never have been tempted  
By a demon or a god.  
You who stand above them now,  
Your hatchets blunt and bloody,  
You were not there before,  
When I lay upon a mountain  
And my father's hand was trembling  
With the beauty of the word.  
  
And if you call me brother now,  
Forgive me if I inquire,  
"just according to whose plan?"  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will kill you if I must,  
I will help you if I can.  
When it all comes down to dust  
I will help you if I must,  
I will kill you if I can.  
And mercy on our uniform,  
Man of peace or man of war,  
The peacock spreads his fan.

Suzanne takes you down to her place near the river,  
You can hear the boats go by you can spend the night beside her,  
And you know that she's half crazy but that's why you wanna be there,  
And she feeds you tea and oranges that come all the way from China,  
And just when you mean to tell her that you have no love to give her,  
Then she gets you on her wavelength and she lets the river answer,  
That you've always been her lover.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with her,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you know that she will trust you,  
For you've touched her perfect body with your mind.  
  
And Jesus was a sailor when He walked upon the water,  
And He spent a long time watching from His lonely wooden tower,  
And when He knew for certain only drowning men could see him,  
He said "all men will be sailors then until the sea shall free them,"  
But He Himself was broken, long before the sky would open  
Forsaken, almost human, He sank beneath your wisdom like a stone.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with him,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you think maybe you'll trust him,  
For he's touched your perfect body with his mind.  
  
Now Suzanne takes your hand and she leads you to the river,  
She is wearing rags and feathers from Salvation Army counters,  
And the sun pours down like honey on Our Lady of the Harbour,  
And she shows you where to look among the garbage and the flowers,  
There are heroes in the seaweed, there are children in the morning,  
They are leaning out for love and they will lean that way forever,  
While Suzanne holds the mirror.  
  
[Chorus]  
And you want to travel with her,  
And you want to travel blind,  
And you know that you can trust her,  
For she's touched your perfect body with her mind.

Many men have loved the bells  
You fastened to the rein,  
And everyone who wanted you  
They found what they will always want again.  
Your beauty lost to you yourself  
Just as it was lost to them.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
Whatever useless things these hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one you love.  
  
Your body like a searchlight  
My poverty revealed,  
I would like to try your charity  
Until you cry, "Now you must try my greed."  
And everything depends upon  
How near you sleep to me  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue  
All the lonely things my hands have done.  
Let me see your beauty broken down  
Like you would do for one your love.  
  
Hungry as an archway  
Through which the troops have passed,  
I stand in ruins behind you,  
With your winter clothes, your broken sandal straps.  
I love to see you naked over there  
Especially from the back.  
  
Oh take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,  
Untie for me your hired blue gown,  
Like you would do for one that you love.  
  
You're faithful to the better man,  
I'm afraid that he left.  
So let me judge your love affair  
In this very room where I have sentenced  
Mine to death.  
I'll even wear these old laurel leaves  
That he's shaken from his head.  
  
Just take this longing from my tongue,  
All the useless things my hands have done,  
Let me see your beauty broken down,  
Like you would do for one you love.  
Like you would do for one you love.

Now in Vienna there are ten pretty women  
There's a shoulder where Death comes to cry  
There's a lobby with nine hundred windows  
There's a tree where the doves go to die  
There's a piece that was torn from the morning,  
And it hangs in the Gallery of Frost  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz with the clamp on its jaws  
I want you, I want you, I want you  
On a chair with a dead magazine  
In the cave at the tip of the lilly,  
In some hallway where love's never been  
On a bed where the moon has been sweating,  
In a cry filled with footsteps and sand  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take its broken waist in your hand  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
There's a concert hall in Vienna  
Where your mouth had a thousand reviews  
There's a bar where the boys have stopped talking  
They've been sentenced to death by the blues  
Ah, but who is it climbs to your picture  
With a garland of freshly cut tears?  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
Take this waltz, it's been dying for years  
  
There's an attic where children are playing,  
Where I've got to lie down with you soon,  
In a dream of Hungarian lanterns,  
In the mist of some sweet afternoon  
And I'll see what you've chained to your sorrow,  
All your sheep and your lillies of snow  
  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
With its "I'll never forget you, you know!"  
  
This waltz, this waltz, this waltz, this waltz  
With its very own breath of brandy and Death  
Dragging its tail in the sea  
  
And I'll dance with you in Vienna  
I'll be wearing a river's disguise  
The hyacinth wild on my shoulder,  
My mouth on the dew of your thighs  
And I'll bury my soul in a scrapbook,  
With the photographs there, and the moss  
And I'll yield to the flood of your beauty  
My cheap violin and my cross  
And you'll carry me down on your dancing  
To the pools that you lift on your wrist  
O my love, o my love  
Take this waltz, take this waltz  
It's yours now. It's all that there is

Written by Redd Stewart and Pee Wee King  
Additional verse: Leonard Cohen  
  
I was dancing with my darlin'  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
When an old friend I happened to see  
Introduced him to my loved one  
And while they were waltzing  
My friend stole my sweetheart from me.  
I remember the night and the Tennessee Waltz  
Now I know just how much I have lost  
Yes I lost my little darlin'  
The night they were playing  
The beautiful Tennessee Waltz.  
She comes dancing through the darkness  
To the Tennessee Waltz  
And I feel like I'm falling apart  
And it's stronger than drink  
And it's deeper than sorrow  
This darkness she's left in my heart.

I fought against the bottle,  
But I had to do it drunk  
Took my diamond to the pawnshop  
But that don't make it junk.  
  
I know that I'm forgiven,  
But I don't know how I know  
I don't trust my inner feelings  
Inner feelings come and go.  
  
How come you called me here tonight?  
How come you bother  
With my heart at all?  
You raise me up in grace,  
Then you put me in a place,  
Where I must fall.  
  
Too late to fix another drink  
The lights are going out  
I'll listen to the darkness sing  
I know what that's about.  
  
I tried to love you my way,  
But I couldn't make it hold.  
So I closed the Book of Longing  
And I do what I am told.  
  
How come you called me here tonight?  
How come you bother with my heart at all?  
You raise me up in grace,  
Then you put me in a place,  
Where I must fall.  
  
I fought against the bottle,  
But I had to do it drunk  
Took my diamond to the pawnshop  
But that don't make it junk.

[cf the lyrics to the song "Anthem" on the Cohen album "The Future"]  
  
(Judy) The birds they sang at break of day  
Start again, I heard them say  
Nor dwell on what has passed away  
Or what is yet to be.  
  
The wars they will be fought again  
The holy dove be caught again  
Bought and sold and bought again  
Until we set them free.  
  
Ring the bells that still can ring  
Forget your perfect offering  
There is a crack in everything  
The light behind to see.  
  
Add up the parts, not yours the sum  
Strike up the march, there is no drum  
Every heart to love must come  
Like a refugee

I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup  
I caught the darkness drinking from your cup  
I said is this contagious?  
You said just drink it up.  
  
I got no future,  
I know my days are few  
The present's not that pleasant  
Just a lot of things to do  
I thought the past would last me  
But the darkness got that too  
  
I shoulda seen it coming  
It was right behind your eyes  
You were young and it was summer  
I just had to take a dive  
When I knew was easy, the darkness was the price.  
  
I don't smoke no cigarette, I don't drink no alcohol  
I ain't had much loving yet  
But that's always been your call  
Hey I don't miss it baby  
I got no taste for anything at all  
  
I used to love the rainbow  
And I used to love the view  
Another early morning, I'd pretend that it was you  
But I caught the darkness baby  
And I got it worse than you  
  
I caught the darkness, it was drinking from your cup  
I caught the darkness, drinking from your cup  
I said is this contagious?  
You said just drink it up

The sea so deep and blind  
The sun, the wild regret  
The club, the wheel, the mind,  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The club, the wheel, the mind  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The blood, the soil, the faith  
These words you can't forget  
Your vow, your holy place  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The blood, the soil, the faith  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
A cross on every hill  
A star, a minaret  
So many graves to fill  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
So many graves to fill  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
The sea so deep and blind  
Where still the sun must set  
And time itself unwind  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  
And time itself unwind  
O love, aren't you tired yet?  

Give me back my broken night  
My mirrored room, my secret life  
It's lonely here,  
There's no one left to torture  
Give me absolute control  
Over every living soul  
And lie beside me, baby,  
That's an order!  
  
Give me crack and anal sex  
Take the only tree that's left  
And stuff it up the hole  
In your culture  
Give me back the berlin wall  
Give me stalin and st paul  
I've seen the future, brother  
It is murder.  
  
Things are going to slide, slide in all directions  
Won't be nothing  
Nothing you can measure anymore  
The blizzard, the blizzard of the world  
Has crossed the threshold  
And it has overturned  
The order of the soul  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
When they said repent repent  
I wonder what they meant  
  
You don't know me from the wind  
You never will, you never did  
I'm the little jew  
Who wrote the bible  
I've seen the nations rise and fall  
I've heard their stories, heard them all  
But love's the only engine of survival  
Your servant here, he has been told  
To say it clear, to say it cold:  
It's over, it ain't going  
Any further  
And now the wheels of heaven stop  
You feel the devil's riding crop  
Get ready for the future:  
It is murder.  
  
Things are going to slide  
  
There'll be the breaking of the ancient  
Western code  
Your private life will suddenly explode  
There'll be phantoms  
There'll be fires on the road  
And the white man dancing  
You'll see a woman  
Hanging upside down  
Her features covered by her fallen gown  
And all the lousy little poets  
Coming round  
Tryin' to sound like charlie manson  
And the white man dancin'  
  
Give me back the berlin wall  
Give me stalin and st paul  
Give me christ  
Or give me hiroshima  
Destroy another fetus now  
We don't like children anyhow  
I've seen the future, baby  
It is murder.  
  
Things are going to slide  
  
When they said repent repent

One by one, the guests arrive  
The guests are coming through  
The open-hearted many  
The broken-hearted few  
And no one knows where the night is going  
And no one knows why the wine is flowing  
Oh love I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
I need you  
Oh I need you now  
  
And those who dance, begin to dance  
Those who weep begin  
And "Welcome, welcome" cries a voice  
"Let all my guests come in."  
  
And no one knows where the night is going  
  
And all go stumbling through that house  
in lonely secrecy  
Saying "Do reveal yourself"  
or "Why has thou forsaken me?"  
  
And no one knows where the night is going  
  
All at once the torches flare  
The inner door flies open  
One by one they enter there  
In every style of passion  
  
And no one knows where the night is going  
  
And here they take their sweet repast  
While house and grounds dissolve  
And one by one the guests are cast  
Beyond the garden wall  
  
And no one knows where the night is going  
  
Those who dance, begin to dance  
Those who weep begin  
Those who earnestly are lost  
Are lost and lost again  
  
And no one knows where the night is going  
  
One by the guests arrive  
The guests are coming through  
The broken-hearted many  
The open-hearted few  
  
And no one knows where the night is going

And where, where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight  
I've heard all the wild reports, they can't be right  
But whose head is this she's dancing with on the threshing floor  
whose darkness deepens in her arms a little more  
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?  
Where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?  
  
Ah the silver knives are flashing in the tired old cafe  
A ghost climbs on the table in a bridal negligee  
She says, "My body is the light, my body is the way"  
I raise my arm against it all and I catch the bride's bouquet  
  
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?  
Too early for the rainbow, too early for the dove  
These are the final days, this is the darkness, this is the flood  
And there is no man or woman who can't be touched  
But you who come between them will be judged  
  
And where, where is my Gypsy wife tonight?

Baby, I've been waiting,  
I've been waiting night and day.  
I didn't see the time,  
I waited half my life away.  
There were lots of invitations  
And I know you sent me some,  
But I was waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
I know you really loved me.  
But, you see, my hands were tied.  
I know it must have hurt you,  
It must have hurt your pride  
To have to stand beneath my window  
With your bugle and your drum,  
And me I'm up there waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Ah I don't believe you'd like it,  
You wouldn't like it here.  
There ain't no entertainment  
And the judgments are severe.  
The Maestro says it's Mozart  
But it sounds like bubble gum  
When you're waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Waiting for the miracle  
There's nothing left to do.  
I haven't been this happy  
Since the end of World War II.  
  
Nothing left to do  
When you know that you've been taken.  
Nothing left to do  
When you're begging for a crumb  
Nothing left to do  
When you've got to go on waiting  
Waiting for the miracle to come.  
  
I dreamed about you, baby.  
It was just the other night.  
Most of you was naked  
Ah but some of you was light.  
The sands of time were falling  
From your fingers and your thumb,  
And you were waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come  
  
Ah baby, let's get married,  
We've been alone too long.  
Let's be alone together.  
Let's see if we're that strong.  
Yeah let's do something crazy,  
Something absolutely wrong  
While we're waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.  
  
Nothing left to do  
  
When you've fallen on the highway  
And you're lying in the rain,  
And they ask you how you're doing  
Of course you'll say you can't complain  
If you're squeezed for information,  
That's when you've got to play it dumb  
You just say you're out there waiting  
For the miracle, for the miracle to come.

(Written By Cohen, Performed In "Night Magic")  
  
(Angels) We told you so  
We told you dear  
You didn't have  
To come here  
  
The human life  
Is full of quirks  
We can't work it out  
Nothing works  
  
It's a lemon  
This mechanic  
Live, love, suffer  
Die and panic  
  
It lives, it loves  
Suffers and dies  
It eats cow's meat  
And apple pies  
  
Dumb, dumb, dumb  
And full of fear  
Anxiety and strife..  
This is the human life!  
  
... We have many duties still  
Much gold and silver light to spill  
On anxious boys and frightened girls like you...

And who by fire, who by water,  
Who in the sunshine, who in the night time,  
Who by high ordeal, who by common trial,  
Who in your merry merry month of may,  
Who by very slow decay,  
And who shall I say is calling?  
  
And who in her lonely slip, who by barbiturate,  
Who in these realms of love, who by something blunt,  
And who by avalanche, who by powder,  
Who for his greed, who for his hunger,  
And who shall I say is calling?  
  
And who by brave assent, who by accident,  
Who in solitude, who in this mirror,  
Who by his lady's command, who by his own hand,  
Who in mortal chains, who in power,  
And who shall I say is calling?

Why don't you try to do without him?  
Why don't you try to live alone?  
Do you really need his hands for your passion?  
Do you really need his heart for your throne?  
Do you need his labour for your baby?  
Do you need his beast for the bone?  
Do you need to hold a leash to be a lady?  
I know you're going to make, make it on your own  
Why don't your try to forget him?  
Just open up your dainty little hand  
You know this life is filled with many sweet companions  
Many satisfying one-night stands  
Do you want to be the ditch around a tower?  
Do you want to be the moonlight in his cave?  
Do you want to give your blessing to his power  
As he goes whistling past his daddy, past his daddy's grave  
  
I'd like to take you take you to the ceremony  
Well, that is if I remember the way  
You see Jack and Jill they're going to join their misery  
I'm afraid it's time for everyone to pray  
You can see they've finally taken cover  
They're willing, yeah they're willing to obey  
Their vows are difficult, they're for each other  
So let nobody put a loophole, a loophole in their way
