Riding in the bus down the boulevard  
And the place was pretty packed (yeah!)  
Couldn't find a seat so I had to stand  
With the perverts in the back  
It was smelling like a locker room  
There was junk all over the floor  
We're already packed in like sardines  
But we're stopping to pick up more, look out  
  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus  
Another comes on and another comes on  
Another one rides the bus  
Hey, he's gonna sit by you  
Another one rides the bus  
  
There's a suitcase poking me in the ribs  
There's an elbow in my ear  
There's a smelly old bum standing next to me  
Hasn't showered in a year  
I think I'm missing a contact lens  
I think my wallet's gone  
And I think this bus is stopping again  
To let a couple more freaks get on look out  
  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus  
Another comes on and another comes on  
Another one rides the bus

And my face is turning blue (yeah)  
I haven't been in a crowd like this  
Since I went to see the who  
Well I should've got off a couple miles ago  
But I couldn't get to the door  
There isn't any room for me to breathe  
And now we're gonna pick up more  
  
Another one rides the bus  
Another one rides the bus  
Another comes on and another comes on  
Another one rides the bus  
Hey, he's gonna sit by you

Yeah another tattoo baby  
(A-noth-noth-nother tattoo)  
(Noth noth nother tattoo)  
  
No part of me is blank I'm really ink obsessed  
It's like an art show the moment that I get undressed  
At every job interview they're just so impressed  
'Cause I got all my ex-wives' names on my chest  
Over here is Clay Aiken, there's a side of bacon  
And I'm in a torpedo fighting with Satan  
Next to hello kitty and a zombie ice skating and wait  
It's Ronald Reagan  
  
I got these dragons, I got these dolphins  
All inscribed on me indelibly  
I've had bad reactions, bad infections  
Even Hepatitis C  
My friends think that I need therapy  
Maybe some laser surgery  
For the flaming goat skull on my knee  
Knee (knee) knee (knee) knee, hey  
  
Beautiful tats (yeah) all over my back (all over)  
And I've got some space here on the side of my face here

Is this the real life  
Is this just fantasy  
Caught in a landslide  
No escape from reality  
Open your eyes  
Look up to the skies and see  
I'm just a poor boy, I need no sympathy  
'Cause I'm easy come, easy go  
Little high, little low  
Anyway the wind blows, doesn't really matter to me  
To me  
  
Mama, just killed a man  
Put a gun against his head  
Pulled my trigger, now he's dead  
Mama, life had just begun  
But now I've gone and thrown it all away  
Mama, ooo  
Didn't mean to make you cry  
If I'm not back again this time tomorrow  
Carry on, carry on, as if nothing really matters  
  
Too late, my time has come  
Sends shivers down my spine  
Body's aching all the time  
Goodbye everybody - I've got to go  
Gotta leave you all behind and face the truth  
Mama, ooo  
I don't want to die  
I sometimes wish I'd never been born at all  
  
I see a little silhouetto of a mam  
Scaramouch, scaramouch, will you do the Fandango  
Thunderbolt and lightning - very, very frightening me  
Galileo, Galileo  
Galileo, Galileo  
Galileo figaro - Magnifico... Hey! Hey! Hey!  
I'm just a poor boy, nobody loves me  
He's just a poor boy from a poor family  
Spare him his life from this monstrosity  
Easy come, easy go, will you let me go?  
Bismillah! No, we will not let you go - let him go  
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go  
Bismillah! We will not let you go - let him go  
Will not let you go - let him go  
Will not let you go - let him go  
No, no, no, no, no no no no no!  
  
Oh mama mia, mama mia, mama mia let me go  
Beelzebub has a devil put aside for me, for me  
For me  
  
So you think you can stone me and spit in my eye  
So you think you can love me and leave me to die  
Oh, baby - Can't do this to me, baby  
Just gotta get out - just gotta get right outta here  
  
Nothing really matters  
Anyone can see  
Nothing really matters  
Nothing really matters to me Anyway the wind blows - Hey!

It's Christmas at ground zero  
There's music in the air  
The sleigh bells are ringing and the carolers are singing  
While the air raid sirens blare  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
The button has been pressed  
The radio just let us know that this is not a test  
Everywhere the atom bombs are dropping  
It's the end of all humanity  
No more time for last minute shopping  
It's time to face your final destiny  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
There's panic in the crowd  
While we dodge debris let's trim the tree  
Underneath the mushroom cloud  
  
You might hear some reindeer on your rooftop  
Or Jack Frost on your windowsill  
But if someone's climbing down your chimney  
You better load your gun and shoot to kill  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
And if the radiation levels OK  
I'll go out with you and see all the new  
Mutations on New Year's Day  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
Just seconds left to go  
I'll duck and cover with my Yuletide lover  
Underneath the mistletoe  
It's Christmas at ground zero  
Now the missiles are on their way  
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked  
On this jolly holiday  
What a crazy fluke we're gonna get nuked  
On this jolly holiday

Watch this  
  
These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say I came up with more secrets to tell
you today  
These are my confessions  
Slip my mind the last two times  
Silly me, so now I gotta give you part three of my confessions  
First I told you about the skank that I was cheating with, then I mentioned
she's having my kid  
That's not all, now I recall more you see, so I'll give you part three of my
confessions  
  
Now this is gonna be the hardest thing I think I ever had to do,  
Gonna tell you everything I left out of parts one and two  
Like remember when I told you that I knew Paulie Shore (Paulie Shore)  
That's a lie, I don't know what I said that for  
I borrowed your chapstick (from you)without asking  
Oh and I tried out your nose hair trimmer (too)  
And by the way your diamond ring is cubic zirconium,  
I killed your goldfish accidently, just replaced it with another one  
  
These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say I need to get some things off my
chest right away  
These are my confessions  
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part
three of my confessions  
Threw up on your dog last time I had too much to drink  
There have been times when I've peed in your sink  
Don't know why, but you and I should agree that belongs in part three of my
confessions  
  
Baby forgive me I'm still trying to figure out why I used your toothbrush to
clean off the bathroom grout  
Oh and sometimes in private, really like to dress up as Shirley Temple and
spank myself with a hockey stick (hockey stick)  
My boss thinks I'm a jerk, didn't get that raise.  
I haven't changed my underwear in twenty-seven days!  
And when I'm kissing you I fantasize you're a midget  
I'm so sorry Debbie! I mean Bridget!  
  
These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say I got a few more secrets I'd like
to convey  
These are my confessions  
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part
three of my confessions  
Gave you buttered toast I dropped and picked up off the floor  
Fyi it was not a cold sore  
Ooops my bad, but you'll be madder at me when I finish part three of my
confessions  
  
You don't know how hard it is for me to tell you this, but you remember that
shirt you got me for my birthday?  
Well, I returned it for store credit. That thing was hideous, what were you
thinking?  
Oh and by the way, I wasn't really sick last week,  
I just didn't wanna go to your stupid office picnic  
Oh and when I told you at breakfast we were all out of rice krispies,  
What I meant was that there was only enough left for me. Sorry.  
  
These are my confessions  
Just when I thought I said all I could say, I thought of some more things that
should scare you away  
These are my confessions  
Slipped my mind the last two times, silly me, I guess I gotta give you part
three of my confessions  
Once I blew my nose and then I wiped it on your cat  
And I lied, yes that dress makes you look fat  
Anyway, I shouldn't say anymore 'til I give you part four of my confessions  
  
I mean I'm just getting started here  
I'm not even half way down the list  
I mean this thing could go on for....(footsteps)  
Hey, hey where are you going?  
Honey? What? Was it something I said?(door opens and slams close)  
(Sigh) Women

Put down your chainsaw and listen to me  
It's time for us to join in the fight  
It's time to let your babies grow up to be cowboys  
It's time to let the bedbugs bite  
  
You better put all your eggs in one basket  
You better count your chickens before they hatch  
You better sell some wine before it's time  
You better find yourself an itch to scratch  
  
You better squeeze all the Charmin you can while Mr. Whipple's not around  
Stick your head in the microwave and get yourself a tan  
  
Talk with your mouth full  
Bite the hand that feeds you  
Bite on more than you chew  
What can you do  
Dare to be stupid  
  
Take some wooden nickles  
Look for Mr. Goodbar  
Get your mojo working now  
I'll show you how  
You can dare to be stupid  
  
You can turn the other cheek  
You can just give up the ship  
You can eat a bunch of sushi and forget to leave a tip  
  
Dare to be stupid  
Come on and dare to be stupid  
It's so easy to do  
Dare to be stupid  
We're all waiting for you  
Let's go  
  
It's time to make a mountain out of a molehill  
So can I have a volunteer  
There's no more time for crying over spilled milk  
Now it's time for crying in your beer  
  
Settle down, raise a family, join the P-T-A  
Buy some sensible shoes and a Chevrolet  
And party 'till you're broke and they drive you away  
It's OK, you can dare to be stupid  
  
It's like spitting on a fish  
It's like barking up a tree  
It's like I said you gotta buy one if you want to get one free  
  
Dare to be stupid (yes)  
Why don't you dare to be stupid  
It's so easy to do  
Dare to be stupid  
We're all waiting for you  
Dare to be stupid  
  
Burn your candle at both ends  
Look a gift horse in the mouth  
Mashed potatoes can be your friends  
  
You can be a coffee achiever  
You can sit around the house and watch Leave It To Beaver  
The future's up to you  
So what you gonna do  
  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
What did I say  
Dare to be stupid  
Tell me, what did I say  
Dare to be stupid  
It's alright  
Dare to be stupid  
We can be stupid all night  
Dare to be stupid  
Come on, join the crowd  
Dare to be stupid  
Shout it out loud  
Dare to be stupid  
I can't hear you  
Dare to be stupid  
OK, I can hear you now  
Dare to be stupid  
Let's go, Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid  
Dare to be stupid

Once in a while maybe you will feel the urge  
To break international copyright law  
By downloading M-P-3's from file-sharing sites  
Like Morpheus or Grokster or LimeWire or KaZaA  
But deep in your heart you know the guilt would drive you mad  
And the shame would leave a permanent scar  
'Cause you start out stealing songs, and then you're robbing liquor stores  
And selling crack and running over school kids with your car  
  
So don't download this song  
The record store's where you belong  
Go and buy the C-D like you know that you should  
Oh don't download this song  
  
Oh you don't want to mess with the are I double A  
They'll sue you if you burn that C-D-are  
It doesn't matter if you're a grandma or a 7-year-old girl  
They'll treat you like the evil, hard-bitten criminal scum you are  
  
So don't download this song  
Don't go pirating music all day long  
Go and buy the C-D like you know that you should  
Oh, don't download this song  
  
Don't take away money from artists just like me  
How else can I afford another solid gold Humvee?  
And diamond-studded swimming pools, these things don't grow on trees  
So all I ask is everybody, please  
  
Don't download this song (Don't do it, no, no)  
Even Lars Urlich knows it's wrong (You can just ask him)  
Go and buy the C-D like you know that you should (You really should)  
Oh, don't download this song  
  
Don't download this song (Oh please don't you do it)  
Or you might wind up in jail like Tommy Chong (Remember Tommy)  
Go and buy the C-D (Right Now) like you know that you should (Go out and buy
it)  
Oh don't download this song  
  
Don't download this song (No no no no no no)  
Or you'll burn in Hell before too long (And you'd deserve it)  
Go and buy the C-D (Just buy it) like you know that you should (Ya cheap
bastard)  
Oh, don't download this song

How come you're always such a fussy young man  
Don't want no Cap'n Crunch, don't want no Raisin Bran  
Well don't you know that other kids are starvin' in Japan  
So eat it, just eat it  
  
Don't want to argue, I don't want to debate  
Don't want to hear about what kinds of foods you hate  
You won't get no dessert 'till you clean off you're plate  
So eat it  
  
Don't you tell me you're full  
Just eat it, eat it  
Get yourself an egg and beat it  
  
Have some more chicken  
Have some more pie  
It doesn't matter  
If it's boiled or fried  
  
Just eat it, just eat it  
Just eat it, just eat it, Woo!  
  
Your table manners are a crying shame  
You're playing with your food, this ain't some kind of game  
Now, if you starve to death  
You'll just have yourself to blame  
So eat it. Just eat it.  
  
You better listen, better do as you're told  
You haven't even touched your tuna casserole  
You better chow down, or it's gonna get cold  
So eat it.  
  
I don't care if you're full  
Just eat it, eat it  
Open up your mouth and feed it  
  
Have some more yogurt  
Have some more Spam  
It doesn't matter if it's fresh or canned  
Just eat it! Eat it! Eat it! Eat it!  
Don't you make me repeat it!  
  
Have a banana, have a whole bunch  
It doesn't matter what you had for lunch  
  
Just eat it! Eat it!  
Eat it! Eat it!  
Eat it! Eat it!  
If it's getting cold, reheat it  
  
Have a big dinner.  
Have a light snack  
If you don't like it, you can't send it back  
  
Just eat it! Eat it!  
Get yourself an egg and beat it!  
  
Have some more chicken. Have some more pie  
It doesn't matter if it's boiled or fried  
  
Just eat it! Eat it!  
Don't you make me repeat it!

Your butt is wide, well mine is too  
Just watch your mouth or I'll sit on you  
The word is out, better treat me right  
'Cause I'm the king of cellulite  
Ham on, ham on, ham on whole wheat, all right  
  
My zippers bust, my buckles break  
I'm too much man for you to take  
The pavement cracks when I fall down  
I've got more chins than Chinatown  
  
Well, I've never used a phone booth  
And I've never seen my toes  
When I'm goin' to the movies  
I take up seven rows  
  
Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on you know  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
Don'tcha call me pudgy, portly or stout  
Just now tell me once again who's fat  
  
When I walk out to get my mail  
It measures on the Richter scale  
Down at the beach I'm a lucky man  
I'm the only one who gets a tan  
If I have one more pie a la mode  
I'm gonna need my own zip code  
  
When you're only having seconds  
I'm having twenty-thirds  
When I go to get my shoes shined  
I gotta take their word  
  
Because I'm fat, I'm fat, sha mone  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it you know  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
And my shadow weighs forty-two pounds  
Lemme tell you once again who's fat  
  
If you see me comin' your way  
Better give me plenty space  
If I tell you that I'm hungry  
Then won't you feed my face  
  
Because I'm fat, I'm fat, come on  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
Woo woo woo, when I sit around the house  
I really sit around the house  
  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, come on  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know it  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know, you know, you know, come on  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
And you know all by myself I'm a crowd  
Lemme tell you once again  
  
You know I'm huge, I'm fat, you know it  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, you know, ho  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
You know I'm fat, I'm fat, you know it, you know  
(Fat, fat, really really fat)  
And the whole world knows I'm fat and I'm proud  
Just tell me once again who's fat

Fun Zone doesn't really have any lyrics.  
People occasionally say "yeah" and other similar phrases,  
But it's generally just music.  
  
In the movie,  
It played in the background  
When Stanley rode out in the miniature fire engine  
At the beginning of an episode of Stanley Spadowski's Clubhouse.  
  
The song is approximately  
1 minute and 45 seconds long,  
But it did not play in its entirety in the movie.

I woke up this morning  
Then I went back to bed  
Said I woke up this morning  
Then I went right back to bed  
Got a funny kind of feelin' like I got broken glass in my underwear  
And a herd of wild pigs is trying to chew off my head  
You know what I'm sayin'  
  
Well I ain't got not money  
I'm just walkin' down the road  
Said I ain't got no money, honey  
So I'm just walking down this lonely old road  
Well, I wish I could get me some money  
But I forgot my automated teller code  
  
I was born in a paper sack in the bottom of a sewer  
I had to eat dirt clods for breakfast, my family was so poor  
My daddy was a waitress, my mama sold bathroom tiles  
My brothers and sisters all hated me 'cause I was an only child  
  
I got the blues so bad, woo  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe I'll, yeah maybe I'll just go bowlin' instead  
  
I'm just a no good, scum sucking, nose picking, boot licking,  
Sniveling, groveling, worthless hunk of slime  
  
Nothing but a low-down beer bellied, bone headed, pigeon toed,  
Turkey necked, weasel faced, worthless hunk of slime  
  
Guess I pretty low self image  
Maybe it's a chemical imbalance or something, I  
I should probably go and see a doctor about it when I've got the time  
Make it talk  
Aw, make it talk, son, make it talk  
OK, now make it shut up  
  
Plagues and famine and pestilence always seem to get me down  
I always feel so miserable whenever I'm around  
I wish somebody would come along, stick a pitchfork through my brain  
I'd flush myself right down the toilet, but I'd just clog up the drain  
  
I got the blues so bad  
Kinda wish I was dead  
Maybe I'll blow my brains out mama  
Or maybe I'll go bowling  
Or I just might go bowling  
Maybe I'll just rent some shoes and go bowling  
Maybe I'll join a league, enter a tournament, put on a stupid looking  
Shirt and go bowling instead  
Yeah

Oh, I couldn't live a single day without you  
Actually, on second thought, well, I suppose I could  
Anyway, what I'm trying to say is, honey, you're the greatest  
Well, at any rate, I guess you're pretty good  
Now, it seems to me I'm relatively lucky  
I know I probably couldn't ask for too much more  
I honestly can say you're an above-average lady  
You're almost just what I've been looking for  
You're sort of everything I've ever wanted  
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow  
You're the woman that I've always dreamed off  
Well, not really but you're good enough for now  
You're pretty close to what I've always hoped for  
That's why my love for you is fairly strong  
And I swear I'm never gonna leave you, darlin'  
At least 'til something better comes along  
'Cause you're sort of everything I've ever wanted  
You're not perfect, but I love you anyhow  
You're the woman that I've always dreamed off  
Well, not really but you're good enough for now  
No, not really but you're good enough for now  

Oh some times I think back to when I was younger  
Life was so much simpler then  
Dad would be up at dawn  
He'd be watering the lawn  
Or maybe going fishing again  
  
Oh and mom would be fixing up something in the kitchen  
Fresh biscuits or hot apple pie  
And I'd spend all day long in the basement  
Torturing rats with a hack-saw  
And pulling the wings off of flies  
  
Those were the good old days  
Those were the good old days  
The years go by but the memory stays  
And those were the good old days  
  
I can still remember good old Mr. Fender  
Who ran the corner grocery store  
Oh, he'd strolled down the aisle with a big friendly smile  
And he'd say "Howdy" when you walked in the door  
  
Always treated me nice, gave me kindly advice  
I don't know why I set fire to his place  
Oh I'll never forget the day I bashed in his head  
Well you should've seen the look on his face  
  
Let me tell ya now  
  
Those were the good old days  
Those were the good old days  
The years go by but the memory stays  
And those were the good old days  
  
Do you remember sweet Michelle  
She was my high school romance  
She was fun to talk to and nice to smell  
So I took her to the homecoming dance  
  
Then I tied her to a chair and I shaved off all her hair  
And I left her in the desert all alone  
Well sometimes in my dreams  
I can still hear the screams  
Oh I wonder if she ever made it home  
  
I tell ya  
  
Those were the good old days  
Those were the good old days  
The years go by but the memory stays  
And those were the good old days  
  
Let me tell ya buddy  
  
Those were the good old days  
Those were the good old days  
The years go by but the memory stays  
And those were the good old days

Gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off  
  
Well, I went out to a party just the other night  
I was jammin' to the music, I was feelin' alright  
I was burning up the floor like a disco maniac  
When my woman said, "Baby, why's your hand behind you back?"  
  
Gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
I said boogie (gotta boogie)  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off  
  
I can't pick it off (uh uh)  
I can't flick it off (uh uh)  
I sure ain't gonna lick it off (oh no)  
So I guess I'm gonna have to learn to live with it  
  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)  
I gotta boogie (gotta boogie, uh huh, he's gotta boogie)  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off  
  
(boogie)  
Gotta boogie  
(boogie)  
  
Hey, you want to boogie? (No man, I don't want to boogie)  
Want to boogie? (Get that boogie out of my face)  
Do any of you want to boogie? (No!)  
  
Gotta boogie on my finger  
Gotta boogie on my finger  
Gotta boogie on my finger and I can't shake it off

Who's that waddlin' down the street?  
It's just me, 'cause I love to eat  
Fudge and Twinkies and deviled ham  
Who's real flabby? Yes, I am!  
Every picture of me's  
Gotta be an aerial view  
Now my doctor tells me  
There's just one thing left to do--  
  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Throw out the pizza and beer  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Oh, get those jelly donuts out of here  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Might seem a little severe  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
I'm gettin' tired of my big fat rear  
Blow, flatty!  
  
Well, I used to live on chocolate sauce  
Made sumo wrestlers look like Kate Moss  
Walked down an alley and I got stuck  
I got more rolls than a pastry truck  
When I'm all done eating  
I eat a little more  
When I leave a room  
First I gotta grease the door  
  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Can't have another eclair  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
I gotta decrease my derriere  
  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
  
No more pie now  
No more creme brulee  
Lay off the gravy  
And souffle  
No french fri-yi-yies now  
No ice cream parfait  
Mr. Cheese Nacho  
Stay away  
  
Oh, I think I'd sell my soul  
For a triple patty melt  
But I need a boomerang  
When I put on my belt  
  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Lay off the 3 Musketeers  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Until my big booty disappears  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
Eat'em till they're comin' out of my ears  
Grapefruit Diet (Diet)  
'Cause I haven't seen my feet in years  
  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet  
I'm on a Grapefruit Diet

Gump sat alone on a bench in the park  
"My name is Forrest," he'd casually remark  
Waitin' for the bus with his hands in his pockets  
He just kept sayin' life is like a box of chocolates  
He's Gump, he's Gump  
What's in his head?  
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump  
Is he inbred?  
Gump was a big celebrity  
He told JFK that he really had to pee  
He never feels too dumb because  
His mom always told him stupid is as stupid does  
He's Gump, he's Gump  
He's kinda square  
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump  
What's with that hair?  
Run... run... run, run, now  
Forrest Run... run... run like the wind now  
Run... run... run, run, now  
Forrest Run... stop!  
His buddy Bubba was a shrimp-lovin' man  
His friend with no legs he called Lieutenant Dan  
His girlfriend Jenny was kind of a slut  
He went to the White House, showed LBJ his butt  
He's Gump, he's Gump  
He's not too bright  
He's Gump, he's Gump, he's Gump  
But he's all right  
Is this Gump out of his head?  
I think so  
Is this Gump really brain dead?  
I think so  
Did this Gump make lots of bread?  
I think so  
And that's all I have to say about that  

Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Well, it's time to celebrate your birthday, it happens every year  
We'll eat a lot of broccoli and drink a lot of beer  
You should be good and happy that there's something you can eat  
A million people every day are starving in the street  
  
Your daddy's in the gutter with the wretched and the poor  
Your mama's in the kitchen with a can of Cycle Four  
There's garbage in the water  
There's poison in the sky  
I guess it won't be long before we're all gonna die  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
Well, what's the matter little friend, you think this party is the pits  
Enjoy it while you can, we'll soon be blown to bits  
The monkeys in the pentagon are gonna cook our goose  
Their finger's on the button, all they need it an excuse  
  
It doesn't take a military genius to see  
We'll all be crispy critters after World War III  
There's nowhere you can run to, nowhere you can hide  
When they drop the big one, we all get fried  
  
(Come on boys and girls, sing along, ok?)  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
wow! (background screaming, sound effect)  
  
Well there's a punk in the alley and he's looking for a fight  
There's an Arab on the corner buying everything in sight  
There's a mother in the ghetto with another mouth to feed  
Seems that everywhere you look today there's misery and greed  
  
I guess you know the Earth is gonna crash into the sun  
But that's no reason why we shouldn't have a little fun  
So if you think it's scary, if it's more than you can take  
Just blow out the candles and have a piece of cake  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Wow!  
  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
  
(Happy Birthday!)  
  
And a pinch to grow an inch!

Nothin' ever (ever) happens in this town  
Feelin' low down (down), not a lot to do around here  
I thought that I would go right out of my mind  
Until a friend told me the news  
  
He said, "Hey, you know that vacant lot  
Right beside the gas station? Well, somebody bought it  
And on that spot they're gonna build a shop  
Where we can go buy bolts and screws"  
  
Since then I've been walking on air (air)

In my sleeping bag I camped out overnight  
Right in front of the store, then as soon as it was light out  
I pressed my nose right up against the glass  
You know, I had to be first in line  
  
Gonna get me a flashlight and a broom  
Want a pair of pliers for every single room of my house  
See those hacksaws? Very, very soon  
One of them will be all mine  
  
Guys with nametags walking down the aisles  
Rows of garden hoses that go on for miles and miles  
Brand new socket wrenches in a plethora of styles  
All arranged alphabetically  
  
And they're doing a promotional stunt  
There's a great big purple sign out front  
That says every 27th customer  
Will get a ball-peen hammer free

Once, there was this kid who  
Took a trip to Singapore and brought along his spray paint  
And when he finally came back  
He had cane marks all over his bottom  
He said that it was from when  
The warden whacked it so hard  
  
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm, ah  
  
Once there was this girl who  
Swore that one day she would be a figure skating champion  
And when she finally made it  
She saw some other girl who was better  
And so she hired some guy to  
Club her in the kneecap  
  
Mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
Ah, mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
  
They got paid for their sound bites  
And sold their TV movie rights  
  
And then, there was this guy who  
Made his wife so mad one night that she cut off his wiener  
And when he finally came to  
He found that Mr. Happy was missing  
He couldn't quite explain it  
It'd always just been there  
  
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
Mm mm mm mm, mm mm mm mm  
  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)  
  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Were)  
Ah ah (There) ah ah (Is)

There he goes, he drives me crazy  
When he says...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
That's his job, it's so amazing  
All he says is...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
I never miss a moment when he's on the tube  
His being there has made my life worth living  
The chills run down my spine  
Each time he says that line  
  
"Here's Johnny!" He says, and laughs in his special way  
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and "second fiddle" is his game  
Ed McMahon's his name...all right  
  
Dressed so fine, he's such a cool dude  
Hear him say...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
Watch him selling beer and dog food  
Hear him say...(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
I got a letter from him just the other day  
He said, "You may already be a winner!"  
A trooper to the end  
A Clydesdale's best friend  
  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and laughs in his special way  
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and that's the way he gets his pay  
What a living  
  
Oh...(Here's Johnny! Here's Johnny!) Wo-o-o, no  
(Here's Johnny! Here's Johnny!) No no no no no no, I don't believe it  
(Here's Johnny!) he says, and everytime it's just the same  
Ed McMahon's his name  
  
A very special guy...all right  
He's on every night  
Can't change the channel  
When he's sitting on the panel  
(Hee-eere's Johnny!)  
There he goes, he gives me goose bumps  
When he says...(Hey-O-Hey-Hey-O!)  
  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, and laughs in his special way  
"...Johnny!" he says, you know I love him  
"Here's Johnny!" he says, that seems to be his claim to fame  
Ed McMahon's his name  

I hear those ice cream bells and I start to drool  
Keep a couple quarts in my locker at school  
Yeah, but chocolate's gettin' old  
Vanilla just leaves me cold  
  
There's just one flavor good enough for me, yeah me  
Don't gimme no crummy taste spoon  
I know what I need  
  
Baby, I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me, ow  
  
They tell me ice cream junkies are all the same  
All the soda jerkers know my name  
When their supply is gone  
Then I'll be movin' on  
  
But I'll be back on Monday afternoon, you'll see  
Another truck load's comin' in for me, all for me  
I'm singin'  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me, ow  
  
(Oh, make it talk)  
  
When I'm all alone, I just grab myself a cone  
And if I get fat and loose my teeth that's fine with me  
Just lock me in the freezer and throw away the key  
Sing it  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with  
  
I love rocky road  
So won't ya go and buy half a gallon, baby  
I love rocky road  
So have another triple scoop with me

Isn't it strange? Feels like I'm lookin' in the mirror  
What would people say if only they knew that I was  
Part of some geneticist's plan  
Born to be a carbon copy man  
There in a petri dish late one night  
They took a donor's body cell and fertilized a human egg and so I say  
  
I think I'm a clone now  
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down  
  
Look at the way we go out walking close together  
I guess you could say I'm really beside myself  
I still remember how it began  
They produced a carbon copy man  
Born in a science lab late one night  
Without a mother or a father  
Just a test tube and a womb with a view  
  
I think I'm a clone now  
There's always two of me just a-hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down  
I think I'm a clone now  
And I can stay at home while I'm out of town  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every pair of genes is a hand-me-down  
  
Signing autographs for my fans  
Come and meet the carbon copy man  
Livin' in stereo, it's all right  
Well I can be my own best friend and I can send myself for pizza, so I say  
  
I think I'm a clone now  
Another one of me's always hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down  
I think I'm a clone now  
I've been on Oprah Winfrey, I'm world renowned  
I think I'm a clone now  
And every pair of genes is a hand-me-down  
I think I'm a clone now  
Thats my genetic twin always hangin' around  
I think I'm a clone now  
'Cause every chromosome is a hand-me-down

When I said that I'd be faithful  
When I promised I'd be true  
When I swore that I could never  
Be with anyone but you  
When I told you that I loved you  
With those tender words I spoke  
I was only kidding  
Now, can't you take a joke?  
  
When I said that I need you, baby  
When I told you that I really care  
When I said that I can't live without you  
When I said I'd follow you anywhere  
When I said you could always trust me  
When I said I'd never leave you flat  
Well, guess what? I was only kidding, baby  
I can't believe you fell for that! You're so gullible  
  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) You thought that was for real?  
I was only kidding  
Now I'm sorry if you misunderstood, but the fact remains  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) Baby, baby, I was  
(I was) only kidding  
Well, I guess I got you pretty good, now listen  
  
When I said that I love you, baby  
From the very bottom of my heart  
When I said that I miss you so badly  
Every second we're apart  
When I swore that you're just getting more and more  
Beautiful every day  
Well, I was only kidding, honey  
What's the matter with you anyway? Let me tell you something  
  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) You understand, don't ya?  
I was only kidding  
Well, I guess it probably hurts you a lot, but you gotta know  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) Come on now, get a clue  
I was only kidding  
I really love you, not!  
  
When I said you ought a marry  
When I said that we should settle down  
Well, I was pullin' your leg there, honey  
I was just foolin' around  
You see, I, I never meant to upset you, darlin'  
I never meant to hurt anyone  
I was only kidding, baby  
Why don't you just put down that gun?  
Let's talk this over  
  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) Watch where you're pointing that thing  
(I was only kidding)  
Hey, I'm sorry if your heart is broke, you gotta realize  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) Aw, yeah  
I was only kidding  
Now, honey, can't you take a joke?  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) I was only kidding  
(I was only kidding) I didn't lie to you  
I was only kidding... Yes indeed  
(I was only kidding) Baby, baby, you know  
(I was only kidding) Hey!

I don't care about your karma  
I don't care about what's hip  
No space cadet's gonna tell me what to do  
I won't swim in your jacuzzi  
You can't make me settle down  
I'd rather kick and jump and bite and scratch  
And scream until I'm blue  
I may as well be hyper as long as I'm still around  
'Cause I'll have lots of time to be laid back  
When I'm six feet underground  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
When are you cosmic cowboys  
Gonna get it through your heads?  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I can't stand the smell of incense  
I don't really like to jog  
No Joni Mitchell 8-tracks in my car, ooh  
I hate anything organic  
Even health food makes me sick  
You won't catch me sipping Perrier  
Down in some sushi bar, I tell you  
Now's the time to go for all the gusto you can grab  
You'll have plenty of time to be low-key  
When you're laid out on the slab  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
When are you cosmic cowboys  
Gonna get it through your heads?  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I don't want no part of that vegetarian scene  
I won't buy me a pair of designer jeans  
No redwood hot tub to my name  
I got all that I want and if it's all the same to you  
I don't need a course in self-awareness  
To find out who I am  
And I'd rather have a, a Big Mac or a Jumbo Jack  
Than all the bean sprouts in Japan  
So don't ask me what I'm into  
I don't need to prove I'm cool  
I'll break your arm if you ask me what's my sign  
I won't tell you where my head's at  
I don't need to see no shrink  
Psychosis may be in this year  
But I'm really not that kind  
And I'm in no hurry to be casual  
In fact, I think, I'll wait  
Until I'm pushing up the daisies  
Like wow, man, can you relate?  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead  
I'll be mellow when I'm dead

You tell a joke and forget the punchline  
Why you always wastin' my time?  
Hey baby, trust me, you just disgust me  
Your hair's a mess and your make-up's crusty  
  
I don't know too many females  
Who make a habit of biting their toenails  
Wo, every time you call, you drive me up the wall  
Honey, just the sight of you makes my flesh crawl  
  
I'm sure we'd be happy together  
If only one little thing weren't true  
Oh baby, I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
You drink the milk right from the carton  
What are you, in kindergarten?  
You're belchin' everywhere, foulin' up the air  
Then you use my razor to shave your back hair  
  
You don't have an ounce of class  
You're just one big pain in the neck  
How much more can I take now  
Give me a break now  
  
You even snore when you're wide awake now  
You tell all your friends we're the perfect couple  
Well, maybe you should get a clue  
'Cause baby, I yi yi yi yi  
  
I'm so sick of you  
Baby, you're so nauseatin'  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
And when you softly call my name  
It's like I'm listenin' to a squeaky chalk sound  
And when you look at me that special way  
It's hard for me to keep my lunch down  
  
And when you ask me what I'm thinkin', honey, usually I'm thinkin'  
How I'd really like to tie your head completely up in duct tape  
So I wouldn't have to listen to you asking me those stupid questions  
Over and over again  
  
Well, that disgusting noise you make when you laugh  
Gives me a throbbing migraine  
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)  
Until you came along, I never dated anyone this low on the food chain  
  
(Can't stand you, I just can't stand you)  
You've got inhuman body odor  
You've got the hair of a boxing promoter  
Yeah, your teeth are all yellow, your butt's made of Jell-O  
  
You wake up in a puddle, droolin' on your pillow  
I hate the way you crack your knuckles  
I hate your whiny loser girlfriends too  
But mostly I yi yi yi yi  
  
I'm so sick of you  
Really now, you're aggravatin'  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
Not to mention irratatin'  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
Well, now won't you give my best regards to Satan  
  
I yi yi yi yi  
I'm so sick of you  
  
I'm so sick of you  
I'm so sick of you  
I'm so sick of you  
You make me sick  
I'm so sick of you, now....

Met this fine young thing  
At the local Circle K  
We made a date for a half past eight  
And I said, "What the hey?"  
  
So I journeyed to her crib  
And I let myself inside  
That chick was slouched down on the couch  
I think her brain was fried  
  
Couldn't figure it out  
She wouldn't even look at me  
Then I saw her eyes, she was hypnotized  
Cold glued to her TV  
  
"Hey, what's your problem baby doll  
Let's have a little fling"  
She said, "Hey you fool, now just be cool  
I'm watchin' that Gilligan's Isle thing"  
  
Isle thing  
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing  
  
Watchin' all night  
Musta, been a marathon  
I was bummin', those shows kept comin'  
Here's what was goin' on  
  
These castaways were stranded  
On this island out at sea  
One of them called Gilligan  
So let's name him after m  
  
He'd mess up every rescue  
Man, that first mate was illin'  
If I was one of those castaways  
I think I'd probably kill 'I'm  
  
Just about that time  
Telephone began to ring  
She said, "Just let it, my machine'll get  
We're watchin' the Gilligan's Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
She loves that Gilligan's Isle thing  
Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing  
Please, baby, baby, please  
  
I like the professor  
He always saves their butts  
He could build a nuclear reactor  
From a couple of coconuts  
  
She said, "That guy's a genius"  
I shook my head and laughed  
I said, "If he's so fly, they tell me why  
He couldn't build a lousy raft"  
  
And while we're on the subject  
I'll tell you one thing for sure  
Those homeboys brought an awful lot  
For just a three hour tour  
  
Then her mom came in the room  
It was kind of embarrassing  
She said, "Hey you two, I was once like you  
And I loved that Gilligan's Isle thing"  
  
Isle thing  
She'd watch that Gilligan's Isle thing  
Please, baby, baby, please  
  
Skipper's in a hammock  
He's looking kinda fat  
He'd throw a fit and then he'd hit  
Old Gilligan with his hat  
  
Mrs. Hal had it goin' on  
But Mr. Hal was meaner  
Ginger and Mary Anne could've used  
Some funky cold medina (?)  
  
I was really diggin' this show  
I didn't know what to do  
It kinda looked like I was hooked  
Now I'm an addict too  
  
I know each episode by heart  
Now I'm the rerun king  
And on every date we both stay up late  
And we watch the Gilligan's Isle thing  
  
Isle thing  
Hasta la vista, little buddy  
Gilligan's Isle thing, isle thing, isle thing

I recall the time they found those fossilized mosquitoes  
And before long, they were cloning DNA  
Now I'm being chased by some irate veloceraptors  
Well, believe me, this has been one lousy day  
  
Jurassic Park is frightning in the dark  
All the dinosaurs are running wild  
Someone shut the fence off in the rain  
I admit it's kinda eerie  
But this proves my chaos theory  
And I don't think I'll be coming back again  
On no  
  
I cannot approve of this attraction  
'Cause getting disemboweled always makes me kinda mad  
A huge tyrannosaurus ate our lawyer  
Well, I suppose that proves, they're really not all bad  
  
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark  
All the dinosaurs are running wild  
Someone let T. Rex out of his pen  
I'm afraid those things'll harm me  
'Cause they sure don't act like Barney  
And they think that I'm their dinner, not their friend  
Oh no  
  
Jurassic Park is frightening in the dark  
All the dinosaurs are running wild  
What a crummy weekend this has been  
Well, this sure ain't no E-ticket  
Think I'll tell them where to stick it  
'Cause I'm never coming back this way again  
Oh no, oh no

I finally made it through med school  
Somehow I made it through  
I'm just an intern  
I still make a mistake or two  
  
I was last in my class  
Barely passed at the institute  
Now I'm trying to avoid, yah I'm trying to avoid  
A malpractice suit  
  
Hey, like a surgeon  
Cuttin' for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Organ transplants are my line  
  
Better give me all your gause nurse  
This patient's fading fast  
Complications have set in  
Don't know how long he'll last  
  
Let me see, that I.V.  
Here we go time to operate  
I'll pull his indsides out, pull his insides out  
And see what he ate  
  
Like a surgeon, hey  
Cuttin' for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Here's a waiver for you to sign  
  
Woe, woe, woe  
  
It's a fact I'm a quack  
The disgrace of the A.M.A.  
'Cause my patients die, yah my patients die  
Before they can pay  
  
Like a surgeon, hey  
Cuttin' for the very first time  
Like a surgeon  
Got your kidneys on my mind  
  
Like a surgeon, ooh like a surgeon  
When I reach inside  
With my scalpel, and my forceps, and re-tractors  
Oh oh, oh oh, woe, oh  
  
Ooh baby, yeah  
I can hear your heartbeat  
For the very last time

All I do is grunt and groan  
Hurts me to walk anywhere  
Went to see my physician, Dr. Jones  
He took my trousers off, told me to cough  
Doctor says there ain't nothin' to discuss  
He tells me any day I might have to wear a truss  
  
Living with a hernia  
All the time, such aggravation  
Living with a hernia  
Gonna be my ruination  
Living with a hernia  
Got to have an operation  
Feel so old  
  
Too much bad pain  
Good gawd, drives me insane  
Can't run, barely crawl  
Got a bulge in my intestinal wall  
Walk real funny, bless my soul  
Can't play tennis and it's hard to bowl  
You can't even do the splits now, better call it quits now  
I'm sick of all this dancin' anyhow  
  
Living with a hernia  
Hurts me bad in a tender location  
Living with a hernia  
Had enough humiliation  
Living with a hernia  
Got to have an operation  
  
I live with a hernia  
Can't get up, can't bend over  
Now I live with a hernia  
Wait a minute  
You may not be familiar with the common types  
Of hernias that you could get  
So just settle down, let me clue you in  
There's incomplete  
Epigastric  
Bladder  
Strangulated  
Lumbar hernia  
Richter's hernia  
Obstructed  
Inguinal and Direct  
  
Living with a hernia . . . Rupture!  
I said it's causin' me such irritation  
Living with a hernia  
Have to have my medication  
Living with a hernia  
I feel bad!  

Here's a llama  
There's a llama  
And another little llama  
Fuzzy Llama  
Funny Llama  
Llama Llama duck  
  
Llama llama  
Cheesecake llama  
Tablet, brick, potato, llama  
Llama llama mushroom llama  
Llama llama duck  
  
I was once a tree house  
I lived in a cake  
But I never saw the way  
The orange slayed the rake  
I was only three years dead  
But it told a tale  
And now listen little child  
To the safety rail  
  
Did you ever see a llama  
Kiss a llama  
On the llama  
Llama's llama  
Tastes of llama  
Llama llama duck  
  
Half a llama  
Twice a llama  
Not a llama  
Farmer llama  
Llama in a car  
Alarm a llama  
Llama duck  
  
Is that how it's told now  
Is it all so old  
Is it made of lemon juice  
Doorknob, ankle, cold  
Now my song is getting thin  
I've run out of luck  
Time for me to retire now  
And become a duck (x6)

Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet Me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
She lived across the street on the fifteenth floor of the Gilmore building  
I saw her in the shower reaching for some soap  
I knew she had to be the girl for me  
And to think I probably never would have found her  
If I hadn't bought that telescope  
  
Oh, me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I just can't understand it  
Why won't you return my phone calls  
Are you still mad I gave a Mohawk to your cat  
If you'd just say the word  
I'm certain that our love would last forever and ever  
Or are you too dumb to realize that  
  
Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
How can you ignore me when you know that I can't live without you  
I have to go through your garbage just to learn more about you  
  
Melanie, ooh  
Oh sweet me-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
You weren't impressed when I tattooed your name across my forehead  
You wouldn't listen when I promised to be true  
I couldn't stand it so I jumped out from the sixteenth story window  
Right above you  
Now I may be dead but I still love you  
  
Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
Me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I'm singin' me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet, sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I'm singin' me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me  
  
I'm singin' me-he-he-helanie  
What can the problem be  
Sweet me-he-he-he-helanie  
Why won't you go out with me

I was waiting in the express lane with my twelve items or less  
At the checkout counter at the local grocery store  
I was only passing by  
But a paper caught my eye  
And I learned a few things I never knew before  
  
It said your pet may be an extra terrestrial  
It said the ghost of Elvis is living in my den  
You can learn to cope with stress  
You can beat the IRS  
And the incredible frog boy is on the loose again  
  
Oh, Midnight Star  
It's in the weekly Midnight Star  
Aliens from outer space are sleeping in my car  
Midnight Star, I want to know, I want to know  
  
Eat jelly donuts and lose twenty pounds a day  
Hear the story of the man born without a head  
And top psychics all agree  
That the telephone company  
Will have a brand new service that lets you talk to the dead  
  
Oh, Midnight Star  
You can believe it if you read it in the weekly Midnight Star  
They're keeping Hitler's brain alive inside a jar  
Midnight Star, I want to know, I want to know  
  
Tell me, tell me, tell me how to make my bust-line grow  
Midnight Star, I want to know  
  
Oh, Midnight Star  
Well, don't you know that I read it, I read it in the weekly Midnight Star  
The UFOs have landed and we'll tell you where they are  
Midnight Star, I want to know, I want to know  
  
Midnight Star  
Well, you can read all about in in the weekly Midnight Star  
You can use you ESP to learn to play guitar  
Midnight Star I want to know, I want to know

I visit Mr. Frump in the hospital  
I see him most every day  
And when I see Mr. Frump in his iron lung  
This is what I hear him say  
  
why'know, Mr. Frump is my very best friend  
He's never a chump or a tease  
He never tells me lies, and best of all  
He never disagrees  
  
I bring him candy and flowers every afternoon  
Sit down by his side and say "Hi"  
And then I ask him his opinion of the world situation  
And I wait for Mr. Frump's reply, and Mr. Frump would say  
  
Well, unfortunately, soon it came to be  
Mr. Frump's dying day  
And now I bring to you the very last thing  
That Mr. Frump had to say....  
  
(deep breathing, that fades and dies off)  
  
Amen

Hey!

Oh, my baby, my baby she don't want me no more  
Ever since she saw his poster in that record store  
She says the way he grinds his molars is really sexy  
She thinks he's so darn dysfunctional and Generation X-why  
She likes his brooding angst and his wild-eyed stare  
Yeah, he's her very favorite slacker multi-millionaire  
  
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder  
Once she was mine, but now I better just forget her  
Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
  
Now, every time I see him, well, he looks so grim  
I guess it really must suck to be a rock star like him  
What a pain in the butt to have so much success  
Spending all his time moping and avoiding the press  
But my girl can't get enough of his sullen demeanor  
Like he's some bit tortured genius  
And I'm some kinda wiener  
  
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
She's got a thing for that Eddie Vedder  
Tell me, what can he do that I can't do better?  
Now my baby's in love with  
I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
Head over heels for that Eddie Vedder  
  
I knew we were headin' for disaster  
When she caught me hangin' out at the Ticketmaster  
Now she's got an unrequited adoration  
For the frustrated, agitated, designated alienated  
Spokesman for the disaffected grunge generation  
  
Well, I don't wear Doc Martens and I don't wear flannel  
And I don't boycott the music video channel  
And I just can't compete with all that money and fame  
But I know two can paly at this kinda game  
Yeah, well, let's just see how jealous she'll get  
When I start stalking Alanis Morissette  
  
Well, my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
She's all crazy 'bout that Eddie Vedder  
Once she was mine but now I better just forget her  
Cause my baby's in love with  
I said I said I said my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder  
Why'd she have to fall for that Eddie Vedder?  
If she wants to leave me, I guess I better let her  
Cause my baby's in love with Eddie Vedder

Peter Parker was pitiful  
Couldn't have been any shyer  
Mary Jane still wouldn't notice him  
Even if his hair was on fire  
  
But then one day he went to that science lab  
That mutated spider came down  
Oh, and now Peter crawls over everyone's walls  
And he's swingin' all over town  
  
La li la, li de da  
La la, li le la da dumb  
  
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man  
Sling us a web tonight  
'Cause we're all in the mood for a hero now  
And there's evil doers to fight  
  
Now Harry the rich kid's a friend of his  
Who horns in on Mary Jane  
But to his great surprise it seems she prefers guys  
Who can kiss upside down in the rain  
  
"With great power comes great responsibility"  
That's the catch phrase of old Uncle Ben  
If you missed it, don't worry, they'll say the line  
Again and again and again  
  
Oh, la la la, di de da  
La la, di di da da dom  
  
Now Norman's a billionare scientist  
Who never had time for his son  
But then something went screw and before you knew he  
Was trying to kill everyone  
  
And he's ridin' around on that glider thing  
And he's throwin' that weird pumpkin bomb  
Yes, he's wearin' that dumb Power Rangers mask  
But he's scarier without it on  
  
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man  
Sling us a web tonight  
'Cause you're brave and you're strong and so limber now  
But where'd you come up with those tights?  
  
It's a pretty sad day at the funeral  
Norman Osborn has bitten the dust  
And I heard Harry's said he wants Spider-Man dead  
Aw, but his buddy Pete he can trust  
  
Oh, and M.J. is all hot for Peter now  
Aw, but Peter, he just shuts her down  
Mary Jane, don't you cry, you can give it a try  
Again when the sequal comes 'round  
  
Oh, la la la, di de da  
La la, di di da da dumb  
  
Sling us a web, you're the Spider-Man  
Sling us a web tonight  
'Cause we all sure could use us a hero now  
And we think that you'll do all right

Ah  
  
Well I heard that you're leavin' (leavin')  
Gonna leave me far behind (so far behind)  
'Cause you found a brand new lover  
You decided that I'm not your kind (ahh)  
  
So I pulled (I pulled) your name out (name out) of my Rolodex (oh)  
And I tore all your pictures in two  
And I burned down the malt shop where we used to go  
Just because it reminds me of you (dippity dippity doo)  
  
That's right (that's right) you ain't gonna see me cryin'  
I'm glad (I'm glad) that you found somebody new  
'Cause I'd rather spend eternity eating shards of broken glass  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
I guess I might seem kinda bitter  
You got me feeling down in the dumps  
'Cause I'm stranded all alone in the gas station of love  
And I have to use the self-service pumps  
  
Oh, so honey, let me help you with that suitcase  
You ain't (you ain't) gonna break my heart in two  
'Cause I'd rather get a hundred thousand paper cuts on my face  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
I'd rather rip out my intestines with a fork  
Than watch you going out with other men  
I'd rather slam my fingers in a door (yeah)  
Again and again and again and again and again  
  
Oh, can't you see what I'm tryin' to say, Darlin'  
  
I'd rather have my blood sucked out by leeches (leeches)  
Shove an icepick under a toenail or two  
I'd rather clean all the bathroom in Grand Central Station with my tongue  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
Yes, I'd rather jump naked on a huge pile of thumbtacks  
Or stick my nostrils together with crazy glue  
I'd rather dive into a swimming pool filled with double-edged razor blades  
Than spend one more minute with you  
  
I'd rather rip my heart out of my ribcage with my bare hands  
And then throw it on the floor and stomp on it 'till I die  
Than spend one more minute with you

Got to work late 'cause my alarm was busted  
The boss chewed me out and everybody's disgusted  
'Cause it's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
I lost one of my socks in the drier  
I can't find my wallet and my hair is on fire  
Just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
I just wrapped my Cadillac around a tree  
A big swarm of locusts is following me  
There's not even anything good on TV  
It's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
Left all my Beatles records out in the sun  
Got a Coke bottle stuck on the end of my tongue  
It's just one of those days  
Gonna be one of those days  
  
The Nazis tied me up and covered me with ants  
And I spilled toxic waste on my brand new pants  
Just one of those days  
Ever have one of those days?  
  
The bank called me up and told me I'm overdrawn  
Some freaks are burnin' crosses out on my front lawn  
And I can't believe it, all the Cheetos are gone!  
It just...just one of those, one of those days  
Just one of those, one of those days  
  
The F.B.I. has got a tap on my phone  
Those darn Russian spies won't leave me alone  
Shouldn't have got up this morning, shoulda known  
It's just one of those days  
It's just one of those days  
  
A 747 crashed into my den  
And there's nothin' but tater tots for dinner again  
It's just one of those days  
Never mind, it's just one of those days  
  
Big steamroller just ran over my mom  
And I cut myself shaving and they're dropping the bomb  
It's just one of those days  
That's all, it's just one of those days  
  
Then late at night, just before I go to bed  
The world blows up and now everybody's dead  
You just can't deny it, it's just like I said  
Just...just one of those, one of those days  
Just one of those days, one of those days

Ooh ooh ooh ee-ooh ooh ooh

Don't really care about my bladder  
But I don't leave home without  
My pancreas  
  
My pancreas is always  
There for me  
Ah-ooh

To the product of their masses  
And inversely proportional  
To the distance between them

Finger food and an ice cold keg  
It won't cost you an arm and a leg  
Dance all night to a rotten band  
Come on, people, let's give 'em a hand  
  
Saturday night, it's the place to be  
Everybody cut footloose with me  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony  
Hey  
  
Met a little lady so pretty and young  
She was quite a little talker 'till the cat got her tongue  
She oozed up beside me, I turned on my charm  
Well, pretty soon she was completely disarmed  
  
I said, "Girl, now don't fall to pieces on me"  
But she cried her eyes out - literally  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony  
Hey, hey  
  
Hey now, buddy, don't you give me no lip  
Sorry I was using your head for dip  
There's a guy in the hot tub, I don't know who  
Wait a minute, it looks like Stu  
  
Well, hold the phone now, what do I see?  
Another pretty mama got her eye on me  
At the party at the leper colony  
Oh, there's a party at the leper colony  
  
There's a party at the leper colony

Hey

I moved out to Langley recently  
With a plain and simple dream  
Wanna infiltrate some third-world place  
And topple their regime  
  
Those men in black with their matching suitcases  
Where everything's on a need-to-know basis  
Agents got that swagger  
Everyone so cloak and dagger  
  
I'm feelin' nervous but I'm really kinda wishing  
For an undercover mission  
  
That's when the red alert came on the radio  
And I put my earpiece on  
Got my dark sunglasses on  
And I had my weapon drawn  
  
So I get my handcuffs  
My cyanide pills  
My classified dossier  
  
Tappin' the phones like yeah  
Shreddin' the files like yeah  
And then I rised all the enemy spies  
I've got to neutralize today  
  
Yeee-aaa-hhh, it's a party in the CIA  
Yeee-aaa-hhh, it's a party in the CIA  
  
I've done a couple of crazy things  
That have almost gotten me dismissed  
Like terminate some head of state  
Who wasn't even on my list  
  
Burn that microfilm buddy, will you  
I'd tell you why but then I'd have to kill you  
You need a quickie confession?  
Well, start a water boarding session  
  
No hurry on the south American dictator  
I'll assassinate him later  
That's when he walked right in my laser sights  
And my silencer was on and my silencer was on  
And another target's gone  
  
Yeah, we've got our black ops all over the world  
From Kazakhstan to Bombay  
Payin' the bribes like yeah  
Pluggin' the leaks like yeah  
Interrogating the scum of the earth  
We'll break them by the break of day!  
  
Yeee-aaa-hhh, it's a party in the CIA  
Yeee-aaa-hhh, it's a party in the CIA  
  
Need a country to stabilize? (stabilize)  
Look no further, we're your guys (we're your guys)  
We've got snazzy suits and ties (suits and ties)  
And a better dental plan than the FBI's  
  
Better put your hands up and get in the van  
Or else you'll get blown away  
Stagin' a coup like yeah  
Brainwashin' moles like yeah,  
We only torture the folks we don't like  
You're probably going to be OK  
  
Yeee-aaa-hhh, it's a party in the CIA  
Yeee-aaa-hhh, it's a party in the CIA

Mom and dad are goin' out for the evening  
And you're stuck inside the house all alone  
That's when you decided it might be fun to harass someone  
Dial a random number up on your telephone  
You ask if their refrigerator is running  
Then you tell 'em they should go out and catch it  
Buddy, if they ever figured out where you were callin' 'em from  
They'd come and bust your head right in with a ratchet  
Listen to me  
Don't go makin' phony calls  
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
I know that you think it's funny drivin' folks up the wall  
But it's really gettin' old fast  
Little Melvin has a natural obsession  
Askin' for Prince Albert in a can  
He gets a kick each time he makes a collect call  
To some guy he doesn't know who lives in Japan  
He's callin' strangers up at three in the morning  
Gives 'em pizza pie delivery at four  
He won't be laughin when they're tracin' his line  
One day the phone police will be there at his door  
Yo, hear me  
Don't go makin' phony calls  
Only dial the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
Swear someday I'm gonna yank that phone cord right out from the wall  
How long is this phase gonna last?  
Come on Moe's bar, what'll ya eat, beat or drink?  
Uh, yeah, hello, is Mike there?  
Last name Rotch.  
Hold on. I'll check.  
Mike Rotch! Mike Rotch!  
Hey, has anybody seen Mike Rotch lately?  
Listen to me, you little puke.  
One of these days, I'm going to catch you,  
And I'm going to carve my name on your back with an ice pick!  
Don't go makin' phony calls  
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
You went through the New York City phone book and prank called 'em all  
Hope that you grow out of this fast  
Dont' go makin' phony calls,  
Please stick to the seven-digit numbers you're used to  
Betcha think it's funny when you're drivin' folks right up the wall  
But you're just a pain in the aaa....

Hey!  
  
Day and night  
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night  
He's all alone through the day and night (day and night)  
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night (at, at, at night)  
  
It's a quarter after one, I'm a little drunk and I need you now  
Said I wouldn't call but I've lost all control and I need you now  
And I don't know how I can do without, I just need you now  
  
And I was like baby baby baby  
Baby baby baby

I got my rock moves and I don't need you  
And guess what, I'm havin' more fun  
And now that we're done, I'm gonna show you tonight  
I'm alright, I'm just fine and you're a tool  
So, so what, I am a rock star  
I got my rock moves and I don't want you tonight  
  
I kissed a girl and I liked it, the taste of her cherry chap stick  
I kissed a girl just to try it, I hope my boyfriend don't mind it  
It felt so wrong, it felt so right, don't mean I'm in love tonight  
I kissed a girl and I liked it  
I liked it  
  
And I'd like to make myself believe  
That planet Earth turns slowly  
It's hard to say that I'd rather stay  
Awake when I'm asleep  
'Cause everything is never as it seems  
  
Blame it on the goose, gotcha feeling loose  
Blame it on the 'tron, catch me in the zone  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
Blame it on the vodka, (HEY!)  
Blame it on the henny (HEY!)  
Blame it on the blue tap, (HEY!)  
Got you feeling dizzy (HEY!)  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
Blame it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol  
  
Shawty's like a melody in my head  
That I can't keep out  
Got me singin' like

That's me in the spotlight, losing my religion  
Trying to keep a view  
And I don't know if I can to it  
Oh no, I've said too much  
I haven't said enough

Your purple prose just gives you away  
The things you say  
You're unbelieveable

(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!

(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly for a rabbi  
  
Meccha leccha hi, meccha hiney hiney ho  
  
Our temple's had a fair share of rabbis in the past  
But most of'em were nudniks and none of'em would last  
But our new guy's real kosher, I think he'll do the trick  
I tell ya, he's to die for - he really knows his shtick  
  
So how's by you? Have you seen this Jew?  
Reads the Torah, does his own accounting too  
Working' like a dog at the synagogue  
He's there all day, he's there all day  
  
Just say "Vay is mir!" and he'll kick into gear  
He'll bring you lots of cheer and maybe bagels with some shmeer  
Just grab your yarmulka and  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!  
  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
And all the goyim say I'm pretty fly (for a rabbi)  
  
He shops at discount stores, not just any will suffice  
He has to find a bargain 'cause he won't pay retail price  
He never acts meshugga and he's hardly a schlemiel  
But if you want to haggle, oy, he'll make you such a deal!  
  
People used to scoff, now they say "Mazel tov!"  
He's such a macher 'cause he works his tuchis off  
Yeah, he keeps his cool and teaches shul  
What's not to like? What's not to like?  
  
Oh high holy days, you know he prays and prays  
And he never eats pastrami on white bread with mayonnaise  
Put on your yarmulka and  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!  
  
When he's doing a Bar Mitzvah, now that you shouldn't miss  
He'll always shlep on down for a wedding or a briss  
They say he's got a lot of chutzpah, he's really quite hhhhhip  
The parents pay the moyl and he gets to keep the tip!  
  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
(How ya doin', Bernie?) Oy vey, oy vey!  
  
Meccha leccha hi, meccha meccha cholly ho  
  
He's doin' well, I gotta kvell  
The yentas love him, even shicksas think he's swell  
Show up at his home, he says, "Shalom!"  
And "Have some cake-You want some cake?"  
  
Yeah he calls the shots, we really love him lots  
Oy gevalt, I'm so ferklempt that I could plotz!  
So grab your yarmulka--  
The one you got for Chanukah--  
  
Let's put on our yarmulkas and--  
Hey! Hey! Do that Hebrew thing!

Hey Lucy, I'm home  
  
Oh Ricky, you're so fine  
You're so fine you blow my mind  
Hey Ricky, hey Ricky  
  
Oh Lucy, you're so fine  
You're so fine you blow my mind  
Hey Lucy, hey Lucy

How I love to hear you whine  
Hey Lucy

You always play your conga drums, you think you got the right  
You wake up little Ricky in the middle of the night  
Stop shakin' your maracas now and just turn out the light Ricky  
  
I'm sick of Fred and Ethel always comin' over here  
'Cause Fred eats all our pretzel sticks and then he spills his beer  
Why don't you serve your casserole and make them disappear Lucy  
  
Oh Ricky, what's a girl like me supposed to do  
You really drive me wild when you sing your babaloo  
Oh Lucy, you're so dizzy, don't you have a clue  
Well, here's to you Lucy  
I love you too Lucy, too Lucy, let's babaloo Lucy  
  
Hey Ricky  
You're always playin' at the club, you never let me go  
I'm beggin' and I'm pleadin' but you always tell me no  
Oh, please honey please, let me be in your show Ricky, wha'  
  
You always burn the roast and you drop the dishes too  
You iron my new shirt and you burn a hole right through  
You're such a crazy redhead I just don't know what to do Lucy  
  
Oh Ricky  
What a pity, don't you understand  
That every day's a rerun and the laughter's always canned  
Oh Lucy  
I'm the Latin leader of the band  
So here's to you Lucy  
Let's babaloo Lucy, too Lucy  
Everybody rumba!  
  
Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha

We all used to call him Jimmy the Geek  
He was a dumb-lookin', scrawny, little four-eyed freak  
He never used to hang around with the guys  
He'd just sit in the corner, attractin' the flies  
  
He wasn't much to look at  
He never was very bright  
But at least there was one thing that he could do all right  
That boy could dance  
  
He was kind of a jerk  
He was kind of a bore  
But the women would scream when he walked in the door  
'cause one thing I could tell you for sure  
That boy could dance  
  
Picking teams, he would always be last  
He couldn't run very far,  
He couldn't think very fast  
If he was on your side, you'd always lose  
The guy had a problem, even tying his shoes  
  
He never passed his drivers test  
He was always afraid of cars  
And he had a complexion that resembled the surface of Mars  
But that boy could dance  
  
Well, his hair was a mess  
And his clothes didn't fit  
He smelled pretty bad, and he drooled just a bit  
But you gotta admit  
Boy, that boy could dance  
  
Now that boy is much older  
He's got his own dance studio  
He's got a teeny bopper fan club  
Yeah, he's got his own TV show  
Now he owns half of Montana  
They all call him "Diamond Jim"  
And you know I'd do anything if I could be just like him  
'cause that boy could dance

Well, hey how ya doin' have a seat, have a drink  
Boy it's good to see you, what can I say?  
Oh, sorry gotta run we'll get together again

If I could stick my hand in my heart  
Spill it all over the stage  
Would it satisfy you  
Would it slide on by you  
Would you think the boy is strange  
Ain't it stra-a-ange  
  
If I could win  
If I could sing  
A love song so divine  
Would it be enough for your cheating heart  
If I broke down and cried  
If I cri-i-ied  
I said, "Ah no, It's only rock 'n' roll  
But I like it  
Ah no, it's only rock 'n' roll  
But I like it, like it  
Yes I do  
I really really really really do do-do do do"

Hear they whip the women just around midnight  
  
Brown sugar  
How come you taste so good  
Brown sugar  
Just like a young girl should

A glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she would make her connection  
By her feet was a footloose man  
  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You might find  
You get what you need  
  
You need honkey tonk women  
Gimme gimme gimme the honkey tonk blues  
  
Under my thumb  
The girl who once had me down  
Under my thumb  
The girl who once pushed me around  
It's down to me

The way she talks when she's spoken to  
Down to me  
The change has come  
She's under my thumb  
  
So, goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still, I'm gonna miss you

Down in the workshop all the elves were making toys  
For the good Gentile girls and the good Gentile boys  
When the boss busted in, nearly scared 'em half to death  
Had a rifle in his hands and cheap whiskey on his breath  
From his beard to his boots he was covered with ammo  
Like a big fat drunk disgruntled Yuletide Rambo  
And he smiled as he said, with a twinkle in his eye,  
"Merry Christmas to all, now you're all gonna die!"  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nick went insane  
Realized he'd been gettin' the raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
  
Well, the workshop is gone now, he decided to bomb it  
Everywhere you'll find pieces of Cupid and Comet  
And he tied up his helpers and he held the elves hostage  
And he ground up poor Rudolph into reindeer sausage  
He got Dancer and Prancer with an old German Luger  
And he slashed up Dasher just like Freddie Krueger  
And he picked up a flamethrower and he barbecued Blitzen  
And he took a big bite and said, "It tastes just like chicken!"  
  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night Kris Kringle went nuts  
Now you can hardly walk around the North Pole  
Without stepping in reindeer guts  
  
There's the National Guard and the F. B. I.  
There's a van from the Eyewitness News  
And helicopters circling around in the sky  
And the bullets are flying, the body count's rising  
And everyone's dyin' to know, oh Santa, why?  
My my my my my my  
You used to be such a jolly guy  
  
Yes, Virginia, now Santa's doing time  
In a federal prison for his infamous crime  
Hey, little friend, now don't you cry no more tears  
He'll be out with good behavior in seven hundred more years  
But now Vixen's in therapy and Donner's still nervous  
And the elves all got jobs working for the postal service  
And they say Mrs. Claus, she's on the phone every night  
With her lawyer negotiating the movie rights  
  
They're talkin' 'bout  
The night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nicholas flipped  
Broke his back for some milk and cookies  
Sounds to me like he was tired of getting gypped  
  
Wo-oh, the night Santa went crazy  
The night St. Nick went insane  
Realized he'd been gettin' a raw deal  
Something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Wo-oh, something finally must have snapped in his brain  
Tell ya, something finally must have snapped, in his brain

"Who fixes plumbing problems in a flash? Twenty four hours a day? Seven days a
week?"  
  
Baby, I sure wish I could lend you a hand  
But plumbing's one thing I don't understand  
It's true (Haven't got a clue)  
be be be baby, I can tell you've got a big problem  
When I flush the john, then your shower goes on  
(Baby) Now watcha gonna do?  
If Drano's a joke and your plunger is broke  
Baby, call the mensch with a monkey wrench  
(Baby) He'll be there for you  
  
Shower's backing up (up, up)?  
Water won't go down (down, down)?  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Don't forget my plumber  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Sink's been stopped up all summer  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Better call the plumber  
He'll know what to do  
  
Pipes been blowing up  
Pipes been breaking down  
And the carpet's soaked... right through  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, kitchen's flooded, too  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, ba-ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba-ba ba ba ba, girl, you know it's true

If he works for one day, costs you half a year's pay  
(Baby) He can be here by 2:00  
So if you've got cash, he'll be there in a flash  
Makin' service calls in his overalls  
(Baby) He'll do his best for you

Leaky pipes are a bummer  
Ba ba-ba-ba, ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Time to call the plumber  
Maybe call a few  
  
Got a problem with plumbing?  
Gotta blame it on something  
Blame it on the drain it was cloggin', cloggin'  
Blame it on the faucet that drips all night  
If hairballs, grease and goo  
Won't let the water through  
Blame it on the drain, yeah, yeah  
  
When I flush the john, now when I flush the john  
It turns your shower on  
(Roto-Rooter 6-5000)  
Ba ba-ba-ba, baby  
Better call my plumber  
He'll know what to do  
  
(Call now. We're in the yellow pages!)

A long long time ago  
In a galaxy far away  
Naboo was under an attack  
And I thought me and Qui-Gon Jinn  
Could talk the Federation into  
Maybe cutting them a little slack  
But their response, it didn't thrill us  
They locked the doors and tried to kill us  
We escaped from that gas  
Then met Jar Jar and Boss Nass  
We took a bongo from the scene  
And we went to Theed to see the queen  
We all wound up on Tatooine  
That's where we found this boy  
  
Oh my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
  
Did you know this junkyard slave  
Isn't even old enough to shave  
But he can use the Force they say  
Ah, do you see him hitting on the queen  
Though he's just nine and she's fourteen  
Yeah, he's probably gonna marry her someday  
Well, I know he built C3PO  
And I've heard how fast his pod can go  
And we were broke, it's true  
So we made a wager or two  
He was a prepubescent flyin' ace  
And the minute Jabba started off that race  
Well, I know who would win first place  
Oh yes, it was our boy  
  
We started singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
"Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
  
Now we finally got to Coruscant  
The Jedi Council we knew would want  
To see how good the boy could be  
So we took him there and we told the tale  
How his midi-chlorians were off the scale  
And he might fulfill that prophecy  
Oh, the Council was impressed, of course  
Could he bring balance to the force?  
They interviewed the kid  
Oh, training they forbid  
Because Yoda sensed in him much fear  
And Qui-Gon said, "Now listen here  
Just stick it in your pointy ear  
I still will teach this boy"  
  
He was singin' my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi,  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
  
We caught a ride back to Naboo  
Cause Queen Amidala wanted to  
I frankly would've liked to stay  
We all fought in that epic war  
And it wasn't long at all before  
Little Hotshot flew his plane and saved the day  
And in the end some Gungans died  
Some ships blew up and some pilots fried  
A lot of folks were croakin'  
The battle droids were broken  
And the Jedi I admire most  
Met up with Darth Maul and now he's toast  
Well, I'm still here and he's a ghost  
I guess I'll train this boy  
  
And I was singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi  
Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"  
We were singin', my my, this here Anakin guy  
May be Vader someday later, now he's just a small fry  
And he left his home and kissed his mommy goodbye  
Sayin' "Soon I'm gonna be a Jedi"

The white stuff, The white stuff  
  
The first one was a sweet one  
Second one was a blast  
Soon I finished off the bag, ate 'em up real fast  
You can see 'em in my teeth  
Tell it when I talk  
Had so many my pancreas just went into shock  
  
I love the white stuff, baby  
In the middle of an Oreo  
I love the white stuff, baby  
It's the most delicious thing I know  
  
I've had a zillion or two  
In my life, they're so right  
My teeth are all rotted clear through  
But who cares? What else am I supposed to do?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Oreo  
The white stuff  
Oh Oreo  
What's in the middle? The white stuff  
  
The first time that I tried it  
Got a big sugar buzz  
Nothing gets me high as that sandwich cookie does  
But I love the filling most  
I rub it on my roast  
Mix it in with my coffee and spread it on my toast  
  
I love the white stuff, baby  
In the middle of an Oreo  
I love the white stuff, baby  
Take some with me everywhere I go  
  
Might get a pimple or two  
Well, so what? It's all right  
Now Twinkies and Ding Dongs won't do  
All I need... You know what it is  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh Oreo, the white stuff [Repeat: x1]  
Oh Oreo  
What's in the middle? The white stuff

Fat and weak, what a disgrace  
Guess the champ got too lazy  
Ain't gonna fly now he's just takin' up space  
Sold his gloves, threw his eggs down the drain  
  
But he's no bum, he works down the street  
He bought the neighborhood deli  
Back on his feet, now he's choppin' up meat  
Come inside maybe you'll hear him say  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser they're our special tonight  
If you want you can have an appetizer  
You might like our salami and the liver's all right  
And they'd really go well with the rye or the kaiser  
  
Never eats while on the job  
He heard it's good to stay hungry  
But he makes a pretty mean shishkabob  
Have a taste they were made fresh today  
  
Try the rye or the kaiser or the wheat or the white  
Maybe I can suggest an appetizer  
Stay away from the tuna it smells funny tonight  
But you just can't go wrong with the rye or the kaiser  
  
So today, his deli comes first  
Still he dreams of his past days of glory  
Goes in the back and beats up on the liverwurst  
All the while you can still hear him say  
  
It's the rye or the kaiser, it's the thrill of one bite  
Let me please be your catering advisor  
If you want substitutions I won't put up a fight  
You can have your roast beef on the rye or the kaiser  
  
The rye or the kaiser  
The rye or the kaiser  
The rye or the kaiser

I eat filet mignon seven times a day  
My bathtub's filled with Perrier  
What can I say?  
This is the life!  
  
I buy a dozen cars when I'm in the mood  
I hire somebody to chew my food  
I'm an upwardly mobile dude  
This is the life!  
  
They say that money corrupts you  
But I can't really tell  
I got the whole world at my feet  
And I think it's pretty swell  
  
I got women lined up outside my door  
They've been waitin' there since the week before  
Who could ask for more?  
This is the life!  
  
You're dead for a real long time  
You just can't prevent it  
So if money can't buy happiness  
I guess I'll have to rent it  
  
Yeah, every day I make the front page news  
No time to pay my dues  
I got a million pairs of shoes  
This is the life!  
  
I got a solid gold Cadillac  
I make a fortune while I sleep  
You can tell I'm a living legend  
Not some ordinary creep  
  
No way, I'm the boss  
The Big Cheese  
Yeah, I got this town on its knobby little knees  
I can do just what I please  
This is the life!  
  
That's right, I'm the king  
Number One  
I buy monogrammed Kleenex by the ton  
I pay the bills  
I call the shots  
I grease the palms  
I buy the yachts  
  
One thing I can guarantee  
The best things in life, they sure ain't free  
It's such a thrill just to be me  
This is the life!  
  
This is the life!

You're sort of famous  
A minor celebrity  
And so it only makes sense  
The world would be  
Obsessed with every  
Single thing you do  
  
They're running 'round  
With their camcorders in the night  
They're lurking patiently  
And hoping that they just might  
See something real embarrassing  
You do  
  
The bad hair day and sweat-stained t-shirts  
That's the story that  
They are gonna feature  
With exclusive pics  
Of your flabby behind  
You think you're all alone  
But that's right when you'll find  
  
A bunch of paparazzi  
Popping out of nowhere  
Cameras in your face  
And then suddenly  
You're on TMZ  
You're on TMZ  
  
Following you  
When you're walking down the street  
And asking stupid questions  
While you're trying to eat  
So you cover your face  
Thinking to yourself  
"Hey, isn't this creepy?"  
  
And they're out there praying  
You'll have a big meltdown  
And take them on a little car chase  
Through this whole town  
They'll be there with you  
When you're going to jail  
First on the scene  
For every wardrobe fail  
  
You just picked up some transvestite  
Seconds later  
It's up on the website  
Get a Vegas wedding  
A quickie divorce  
And they'll be  
Sneaking in  
Snapping pictures, of course  
  
And if they ever catch you  
Picking your nose  
Or storming down the street  
On a drunken spree  
You're on TMZ  
  
Stalking you  
Just waiting by a front door  
Trailing you through  
Airport security  
They were TMZ  
They were TMZ  
  
We caught this Oscar nominee picking up dog poop  
Is that a baby bump?  
I pronounce you guilty, of leaving the house while fat  
Look who's drinking coffee  
Everything celebrities do is fascinating  
  
Oh, let me tell you  
It's getting to the point  
Where a famous person can't  
Even get a D.U.I  
Or go on a racist rant  
Those guys are all around  
So you really shouldn't dare  
Go to every club in town  
If you've lost your underwear  
  
Seems that every single time  
A star decides to shave their head  
Or ram their car into a tree  
They're on TMZ  
  
If they catch you peeing in the bushes  
Later on, that night  
Well, I guarantee  
You're on TMZ  
You're on TMZ  
  
You're on TMZ  
Every single celebrity  
Knows they're gonna be  
There on TMZ

They only show you their gums when they smile  
Ain't got a tooth in their heads now, how vile  
Only can eat things like pudding and applesauce  
They never have to buy toothpicks or dental floss  
  
Hey, stand up  
Toothless people, their breath is lethal, want to tell you  
Hey, come on, stand up, get on your feet  
Toothless people, old and feeble, what I say  
  
No more of those pearly whites will they possess  
Their oral hygiene is frightful, a mess  
Lots of 'em suffering from trench mouth and gum disease  
At least they don't have to worry 'bout cavities  
  
Hey, stand up, take out your teeth  
Toothless people, old and feeble, oh yes  
  
You can brush 'em, you can floss 'em  
They're something you just can't ignore  
If you lose 'em, you're in trouble  
'Cause the tooth fairy won't come no more  
You need something to show your dentist  
The next time he makes you say "Ah"  
You don't want to have to wind up  
Eating all of your food through a straw  
  
(Like toothless people, toothless people)  
You'd better brush your teeth now (hey)  
Toothless, toothless, toothless, toothless people  
Hey, stand up, toothless people

Carbon monoxide  
Making me choke  
No A.C.  
And the radio's broke  
Cars backed up  
Far as you can see  
Seems like I've been waiting here for all eternity  
Oh, and just in case you're wondering  
I'll tell you where I am  
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)  
Stuck right here in the middle of this...  
  
Traffic jam  
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot  
Traffic jam  
The freeway's one big parking lot  
Traffic jam  
My radiator's boiling hot  
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)  
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam  
  
Trapped inside  
My automobile  
Cobweb's gowin'  
On the steerin' wheel  
Now, I'm no genius  
But one thing I know  
I shouldn't have had that bag of bran muffins  
An hour and a half ago  
Yeah, and if you need to find me  
I'll tell you where I am  
I'm right here (right here) right here (right here)  
Stuck smack dab in the middle of this...  
  
Traffic jam  
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot  
Traffic jam  
The freeway's one big parking lot  
Traffic jam  
Well, I thought we were movin' but I guess we're not  
'Cause I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)  
Right here in the middle of a traffic jam  
  
Stuck in the middle of a traffic jam  
yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to  
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper to  
Bumper to bumper to bumper to bumper...  
Yay-hey!  
  
There's a yuppie on a cellular phone  
I'm gonna puke if I here any more  
There's a motorcycle zoomin' by me  
Watch what happens when I open my door  
Now we're all goin' nowhere fast  
Well, I guess that's perfectly clear  
I left home five hours ago  
And I can still see my house from here  
So if anybody's tryin' to find me  
Well, I'll tell you where I am  
Right here (right here) right here (right here)  
Stuck right here in the middle of this...  
  
Traffic jam  
I haven't moved one inch from this here spot  
Traffic jam  
The freeway's one big parking lot  
Traffic jam  
Now my back teeth are floatin' and my nerves are shot  
And I'm stuck right here in the middle (right here in the middle)  
Stuck right here in the middle of a traffic jam  
Traffic Jam... traffic jam... traffic jam... woo!

So rotten, ah, oh!

Look at all this garbage that I keep generatin' (come on)

Bet there's a hundred house codes that I'm violatin'  
Even my dog passed out and need resusatatin'  
You won't believe it, take a whiff of that aroma  
Sure to put you in a coma  
It's so messy can't find my toenail clippers  
It's so bad the roaches wearin' slippers  
Worn, sweatly clothes, pile up in this joint  
Stand up by themselves at this point  
It's so filthy now baby I can't lie  
I wipe my feet before I go outside  
I wonder what crawled in here and died  
Ya know, walkin' around barefoot actin terrified  
But it gives me stuff to talk about with my friends, like  
Hey I think them rats gettin' big (oh)  
  
[Chorus]  
There something rotten here (say what)  
You better hold your nose (oh)

(Oh) Unless your gonna do it  
Careful not to (ay) breathe the fumes  
The garbage piles are goin' all the way to the bathroom  
Turn in to toxic waste sometime this after noon  
Better get a Hazmat suit and a push broom

It makes me want to  
Just makes me want to  
Oh!

Got an AK-47, well you know it makes me feel alright  
Got an Uzi by my pillow, helps me sleep a little better at night  
There's no feeling any greater  
Than to shoot first and ask questions later  
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
Well, you can't take my guns away, I got a constitutional right  
Yeah, I gotta be ready if the Commies attack us tonight  
I'll blow their brains out with my Smith and Wesson  
That ought to teach them all a darn good lesson  
Now I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
(Oh yeah, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh baby, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh I'm so)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away  
  
Oh, I accidentally shot daddy last night in the den  
I mistook him in the dark for a drug-crazed Nazi again  
Now why'd you have to get so mad?  
It was just a lousy flesh wound, Dad  
You know, I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
Oh, I still haven't figured out the safety on my rifle yet  
Little Fluffy took a round, better take him to the vet  
I filled that kitty cat so full of lead  
We'll have to use him for a pencil instead  
Well, I'm so trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
(Oh yeah, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh baby, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh I'm so)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away  
  
Come on and grab your ammo  
What have you got to lose?  
We'll all get liquored up  
And shoot at anything that moves  
  
Got a brand new semi-automatic weapon with a laser sight  
Oh, I'm prayin' somebody tries to break in here tonight  
I always keep a Magnum in my trunk  
You better ask yourself, do you feel lucky, punk?  
Because I'm trigger happy, trigger happy every day  
  
(Oh yeah, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh baby, I'm)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
(Oh I'm so)trigger, trigger happy  
Yes I'm trigger, trigger happy  
Better watch out, punk, or I'm gonna have to blow you away

I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Pedal to the metal, hope I don't run out of luck  
Rollin' down the highway until the break of dawn  
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
My diesel rig is northward bound  
It's time to put that hammer down  
Just watchin' as the miles go flyin' by  
I'm ridin' twenty tons of steel  
But it's sure hard to hold the wheel  
While I'm still waiting for my nails to dry  
  
Oh, I always gotta check my lipstick in that rear view mirror  
And my pink angora sweater fits so tight  
I'm jammin' gears and haulin' freight  
Well, I sure hope my seams are straight  
Lord, don't let my mascara run tonight  
  
Because I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Smokey's on my tail and my accelerator's stuck  
Got these eighteen wheels a-rollin until the break of dawn  
Drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
Oh, I don't mind when my crotchless panties creep right up on me  
And my nipple rings don't bother me too much  
But when I hit those big speed bumps  
My darling little rhinestone pumps  
Keep slippin' off the mother-lovin' clutch  
  
But still I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a big ol' truck  
Headin' down the interstate, just tryin' to make buck  
Wearin' feather boas with sequins and chiffon  
While I'm drivin' a truck with my high heels on  
  
I'm drivin' a truck  
Drivin' a truck  
Got a load to carry and some eyebrows left to pluck  
And I'm late for my appointment down at the hair salon  
So I'll be drivin' a truck with my high heels on
