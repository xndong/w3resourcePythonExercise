I made a rock' n 'roll sin  
When I tried givin' in to  
make money had to turn down low.  
They said, "why be proud, don't play so loud,  
be like us and get a sound that's real thin.  
Wear a polyester suit, act happy look cute,  
get a haircut and buy small gear"  
That's when I turned to them and said,  
"hold it, right there!"  
  
Well it's more to me than just a job,  
and while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.  
Nobody tells a man how to play,  
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,  
Can you hear me say  
  
All men play on ten,  
never gonna turn down again.  
All men play on ten,  
never gonna turn down.  
  
I'm jet fuel honey, plug me into 220  
Step back and let my fingers fly  
While I'm burning up my gear  
There's a fire in your ear  
That won't stop until the day you die.  
  
I really put it to the floor when I hear the crowd roar  
Oh it's music to my ears when they scream  
Then I run back to the power rack  
and deck all of my gear.  
  
Well it's more to me than just a job,  
and while I'm playin' you won't get robbed.  
Nobody tells a man how to play,  
It just ain't that way hey, hey, hey,  
can you hear me say

I made A rock'n'roll  
When I tried givin' in, to make money had to turn down low

And get A sound that's real thin  
Wear A polyester suit, act happy, look cute, get A haircut  
And buy small gear"  
That's when I turned to them and said, hold it, right there  
Well it's more to me than just A job, and while I'm playin'  
You won't get robbed  
Nobody tells A man how to play, it just ain't that way

Hear the call of the wild in us all  
It waits for the night to fall  
I'm getting hot, I'm ready for the night  
No holding back, let's  
I'm gonna give all you can take all night  
And leave you in the morning feeling right  
  
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me  
Gonna set it free  
I'm an animal, there's an animal in me  
Gonna set it free  
  
I've been looking, you've been watching from the side  
There's somethings you just can't hide  
Oh, you're getting wet, you're working up a sweat  
Your hair's standing up on end  
Your skin is screaming, glad we met?  
Tonight's one night you won't forget

Battle hymns did sound the call.  
You came to our side.  
You heard true metal - into glory  
Ride.  
You stood beside us the false ones  
Cried. - Your love is judgment.  
You gave us life.  
You wait in the rain - you walk  
Through the snow. We give you  
Our blood. We want you to know.  
In our eyes your're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever -  
In our eyes your're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever.  
We have read your letters -  
We have heard your call.  
We were brought together -  
Cause we've got the balls -  
To play the loudest metal.  
So hard and so wild and mean. -  
You'll live forever we were  
Born from your belief.  
Metal makes us strong  
Together we belong - forever  
Here's your song. We want you  
To know.  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever -  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forevermore.  
Metal makes us strong  
Together we belong - forever  
Here's your song. We want you  
To know.  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forever -  
In our eyes you're immortal -  
In our hearts you'll live forevermore.

See the writings on the wall  
If you can read  
There's a black list  
Got one name and it's me  
Yea I got no invitation  
But I won't leave  
Gonna keep on fighting  
For everything that's me

Full moon light is calling me  
My kigndom lies within  
The mystic soul and lions heart  
Brought by the talisman  
The ecstasy of battle takes me  
Where the falcons fly  
Immortal youth was granted me  
I will never die  
  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born to teach them all to heel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
  
Pounded by the hammers  
Of the giants of the world  
I can see in darkness  
I'm the overlord  
Single combat I await  
My shadow brings them fear  
The spikes upon my chariot  
Will grind them when they're near  
  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born to teach them all to heel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
  
I am an outcast on the path of no return  
Punisher and swordsman  
I was born to burn  
Black Wind always follows  
Where my black horse rides  
Fire's in my soul  
Steel is on my side  
  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel  
Born to teach them all to heel  
Born of Black wind fire and steel

When the world turns you away  
A friend will not say no  
There is strength that we all have  
It's not the strength we show  
And in your darkest hour  
In your darkest nights  
Whatever life will do  
I am here for you  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like you're reaching the end  
Call on me, know in your heart  
On one you can always depend  
I am thy friend  
Though we're far away  
The stars above are the same  
And when you feel alone  
There's one who shares your pain  
A true friend has no price  
There is none to pay  
I remember you stood by me  
I'm with you all the way  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like you're reaching the end  
Call on me, know in your heart  
One who will always defend  
I am thy friend  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like you're reaching the end  
Call on me, know in your heart  
On one you can always depend  
I am thy friend  
Think of me wherever you are  
When it seems like you're reaching the end  
Call on me, know in your heart  
One who will always defend  
I am thy friend  

Three sons have I, and they  
Ride by my side. The fierce,  
The black, and the wicked are  
Their names we ride down my  
Enemies on their half-hearted flight.  
No voice of mercy no evangels of light.  
  
Mighty messengers heathens rage  
Witness our coming gods of the dead.  
I ride through the air  
I laugh as I die with powers of evil  
Dark knowledge is mine.  
The ride of the wicked.  
The 1st sin was trust.  
Kill without warning for blood now  
I lust.  
  
Strong winds magic mist  
To Asgard the Valkries fly  
High overhead they carry the dead  
Where the blood of my enemy lies.  
  
Three sons have I, and they

Brothers the battle is raging choose your side  
Sing with us the battle hymns into glory ride  
Hail to England the sign of the hammer's our guide  
Forever we're fighting the world side by side  
On a crusade the world we bring  
Four Kings of Metal, four Metal Kings  
Death to the false ones, dance on a string  
'Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a king  
'Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a king  
Our armies in England, Ireland, Scotland, and Wales  
Our brothers in Belgium, Holland and France will not fail  
Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, Italy  
Switzerland, Austria back to the glory of Germany  
On a crusade the world we bring  
Four Kings of Metal, four Metal Kings  
Death to the false ones, dance on a string  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a king  
Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a king  
Sound the death tone on our march for revenge  
Spill the blood of my enemies the oath of a friend  
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring  
Six magic circles were made by the blood of the kings  
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring  
Four Kings of Metal, four Metal Kings  
Songs of true metal we will sing  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a king  
Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a king  
Sound the death tone on our march for revenge  
Spill the blood of my enemies the oath a friend  
Fight the holy war for the crown and the ring  
Six magic circles were made by the blood of the kings  
Wherever we ride, it's metal we bring

Till the blood on your hand is the blood of a King  
Till the blood on your sword is the blood of a King  
Blood of a King, blood of a King  

Wrote a letter to the M.T.V.  
What's goin' on now  
Don't ya care about me  
Sent the same letter to the radio,  
But my party went dead  
Like a shot in the head  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-On your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll  
  
We got lots of stations  
Around the nation  
And the stuff they're playing  
It just ain't worth my sayin'  
People want music to get'em movin'  
We don't want labels  
We want music on the table  
  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-on your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll  
  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-on your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll  
  
We got lots of stations  
Around the nation  
And the stuff they're playing  
It just ain't worth my sayin'  
  
We all like it-Rock and Roll  
We all want it-on your show  
Play it loud,don't play it low  
Blow your speakers with Rock and Roll

Slowly crossing as the river runs below  
Never stopping for what's waiting soon will show  
And this the last time looking back I'll see my home  
For he awaits me reaching for my soul  
He calls my name, and waves me on  
The fallen one he stands in flame  
  
Well the life that he has given full of riches  
And success has a price that I made good in  
Blood to pay. And the light he now is showing  
To guide my every footstep is insurance if  
I falter on my way. And what God has now  
Forsaken and man has never seen are the  
Riches of the underworld below all my  
Years of earthly pleasures gave support  
Unto the bridge I now cross it giving  
Him my soul  
  
Dark Lord, I summon thee demanding the  
Sacred right to burn in hell, ride up on hells  
hot wind. Face one more evil than thou, take  
My lustful soul,  
Drink my blood as I drink yours, impale me on  
the horns of death  
Cut off my head release all my evil Lucifer is king  
Praise Satan  
  
I know the one who waits Satan is  
His name, across the bridge of  
Death there he stands in flame  
I know the one who waits Satan  
Is his name across the bridge of death  
There he stands in flame.  
  
He is my provider as I walk into the  
Void for eternity I give him my soul  
I shall do his bidding obey him  
Without question even walk among the living if  
I'm told  
  
Satan don't forsake me I wait for  
You to take me grant me wings and as  
Your messenger I'll fly

Strike while the iron is hot  
Steel is strongest so say we all  
And if we all were not brothers of metal would we fall? - no -  
They tried to test our spirit  
They tasted steel before we were done  
Grinding their bones into the dust of the past  
All blown away like a shot from a gun  
  
We cast our lot together four still stand as one  
Here we'll remain forever till our kingdoms one  
  
Brothers of metal  
We are fighting with power and steel  
Fighting for metal metal that's real  
Brothers of metal will always be there  
Standing together with hands in the air  
  
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound  
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground  
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall  
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall  
  
Our hearts are filled with metal and masters we have none  
And we will die for metal, metal heals, my son  
  
Brothers of metal  
We are fighting with power and steel  
Fighting for metal metal that's real  
Brothers of metal will always be there  
Standing together with hands in the air  
  
Let us drink to the power drink to the sound  
Thunder and metal are shaking the ground  
Drink to your brothers who are never to fall  
We're all brothers of metal here in the hall  
  
Brothers of metal  
We are fighting with power and steel  
Fighting for metal metal that's real  
Brothers of metal will always be there  
Standing together with hands in the air

We have come from the ashes of the burning away  
Pouring blood in the fire on the altar of pain  
Led into temptation, now the black gods align  
Here there is no salvation and your blood is my wine.  
  
Here's a world that is waiting between the living and the dead  
Here the flesh and its pleasure are eternally wed  
All is all for the taking for a life of a lie  
At the end of the breaking I'll be watching you die.  
  
Crawl to the silence renounce and deny,  
The stars and the numbers foretold of this time,  
To the words and the wisdom too the promise of lies  
By their anger and fury the strong will survive.

When they see us they will run for their lives  
To the end they will pay for their lies  
So long did we wait, now we are home  
  
Here once again there is a battle to fight  
Gathered together for the sound and the might  
So long did we wait, now we are home  
  
Now we will fight for the kingdom fighting with steel  
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal  
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead  
Ride through the blood that we gladly have shed  
  
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight  
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again  
Tonight we will win  
  
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes  
You came here for metal to fight and to die  
Defenders of steel, now we are home  
  
[Chorus:]  
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory  
Armed with a heart of steel  
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me  
To no man shall I kneel  
Their blood is upon my steel  
Blood is upon my steel  
  
Fight for the kingdom fighting with steel  
Kill all of them, their blood is our seal  
Fight till the last of the enemy is dead  
Ride through the blood that we gladly have shed  
  
I now issue the call, are you ready to fight  
Fight all together as one for the right to be free once again  
Tonight we will win  
  
I can see by the look that you have in your eyes  
You came here for metal to fight and to die  
Defenders of steel, now we are home  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Fight for the kingdom bound for glory  
Armed with a heart of steel  
I swear by the Brothers who stand before me  
To no man shall I kneel  
Their blood is upon my steel

The north star always guides me  
When winter skies are gray  
And I wait for the sun when all are one  
I shall not betray  
Calling at me  
I'm waiting  
When all are led astray  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry on when I am gone  
Carry on when the day is long  
Forever carry on  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever Carry On  
  
Darkness all around us  
We don't close our eyes  
No one's gonna ground us  
We were born to fly  
Comin'at us  
No stopping  
Born to amplify  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry On when I am gone  
Carry On when the day is long  
Forever Carry On  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever Carry On  
  
Yeah, be my brother  
Fight to stay alive  
All the world can't change us  
With all their burned-out jive  
Come get us now we're waiting  
We won't run and hide  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry on when I am gone  
Carry on when the day is long  
Forever carry on  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever carry on  
  
Now we're all together  
Let's sing a fighting song  
One hundred thousand riders  
We can't all be wrong  
Comin' at us no stopping  
Always Carry On  
  
Carry on my sons forever  
Carry on when I am gone  
Carry on when the day is long  
Forever carry on  
For as long as we're together  
Then forever carry on

He broke the laws of the elders  
So they plucked out his eye,  
Took his land and fortune,  
Left him to die  
  
Bound on the shoreline,  
Left for the tide,  
Sees his life blood leaving...  
Circling lower the vultures fly  
  
These bones may be broken  
But the spirit can't die  
And the Gods see his anguish  
And give him a sign  
  
From the floor of the ocean  
The ship of the lost souls rise  
And they take him where no one sleeps  
while the undead cry  
Where no one sleeps while the undead cry  
  
And in the world above  
The elders sing,  
On his land they live  
Let death's bell ring  
  
He was met at the gate of Hades  
By the Guardian of the Lost Souls,  
The Keeper of the Unavenged  
And He did say to him:  
"Let ye not pass Abaddon, return to the world from whence you came  
And seek payment not only for thine own anguish  
But vindicate the souls of the unavenged"  
  
And they placed in his hands a sword made for him called Vengeance  
Forged in brimstone and tempered by the woeful tears of the unavenged  
  
And to carry him on his journey back to the upper world  
They brought forth their demon horse called Black Death  
A grim steed so fearsome in might and black in color  
That he could stand as one with the darkness  
Save for his burning eyes of crimson fire  
  
And on that night they rode up from Hell  
The pounding of his hooves did clap like thunder  
  
Burning, death, destruction raping the daughters and wives  
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives  
  
No one can escape me on Black Death I ride  
When kissed by the sword of Vengeance  
Your head lays there by your side  
I take the lives of all that I once knew  
The torn flesh of a slow death waits for you  
  
Burning, death, destruction raping the daughters and wives  
In blood I take my payment in full with their lives  
  
I spare not land or servants my wake is smoke and flame  
I take their wives and daughters  
They stand there watching, watching  
Hoping to gain their livese but when I'm through they know they must pay

Dreadful Thunder  
The storms moving in  
And Judgment day is calling  
My soul has been healed  
By the power of steel  
And the sound of glory  
  
I will send into the ground  
All that are found  
By the sign of the hammer falling  
Yes Heathens will fall  
I will strike down them all  
Then you will know my calling  
  
Bravery calls my name  
In the sound of the wind in the night  
My sword will drink blood  
And I will fight  
Yes I will fight  
In the dawn of battle  
Dawn of Battle  
  
I will rise up from the chaos  
I will rise up from the grave  
A brother to the darkness  
A master to the slaves  
  
I am the soul descendent  
Of the fire and the rage  
I was wrought upon the earth  
Born to rule and battle wage  
  
By the total domination  
Of the world in my command  
By the Air and the water  
By the Fire and the land  
  
I give no explanation  
I was branded by the will  
Bringer of Death and Destruction  
To all that I now kill  
  
Bravery calls my name  
In the sound of the wind in the night  
My sword will drink blood  
And I will fight  
Yes I will fight  
In the dawn of battle  
Dawn of Battle  
  
I long to be free  
So I wait for a sign  
I wait for a star  
To fall from the sky  
From the dust of sleep  
A promise to keep  
Then all who see shall believe  
Deliver into my hand  
The sword of the land  
Let my journey begin  
So all shall understand  
That if I fall  
I will live again  
  
I will rise up from the chaos  
I will rise up from the grave  
A brother to the darkness  
A master to the slaves  
  
I give no explanation  
I was branded by the will  
To bring of Death and Destruction  
To all that I now kill  
  
Bravery calls my name  
In the sound of the wind in the night  
My sword will drink blood  
And I will fight  
Yes I will fight  
In the dawn of battle

Cowards in the grid of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honour long been sold  
For all shall come to know me  
As they fall unto their knees  
Zeus the thunderer, control my destiny  
When the cards of life were dealt  
My hand a ruthless fate  
To avenge, and bringeth fury, Hector feel my hate  
A bloodbath I was born to bring, my birth I'm an assassin  
To cut the cord of life and death  
Ties to Earth unfasten  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall the Hades waits  
Kill...  
Hector's blood lies on the battlefield  
His body's mangled wounds  
The Gods who once protected him are now his Gods of doom  
Like a tower standing tall, steadfast in directioni fall upon your bringing
death, the Gods give no protection  
Coward in the grip of fear, no valor to uphold  
Cut into the Earth, will honor long been sold  
For all shall come to know me, as they fall unto theirknees Zeus the
thunderer, control my destiny  
Blood and fire death and hate, your body I will desecrate  
Dogs and vultures eat your flesh the hall of Hades waits  
Die die die die...

Chains hooked on my heels  
Sittin' on leather  
Ridin' on steel  
  
Put my shades on  
Hair blows in the wind  
I give some square the finger  
Now he won't look again, no he won't  
  
Now, you were sittin' home  
And I got sent to Nam  
I went to the big house  
You just worked at job  
  
Hear me calling can't you hear my death tone  
Hear me calling can't you hear my death tone  
Hear me ride on into the night pull along side  
If you're looking for a fight  
  
My social worker's got me on a chain  
Keeps me out of jail so the paper prints his name  
Yes it does, and he likes it  
  
Unemployment checks run out next week  
It won't be very long 'til I'm back on the streets again

When you are old enough to read this words  
Their meaning will unfold  
These words all that's left  
And though we've never met, my only son  
I hope you know  
That I would have been there to watch you grow  
But my call was heard and I did go  
Now your mission lies ahead of you  
As it did mine so long ago  
To help the helpless ones who all look up to you  
And to defend them to the end  
  
Defender  
Ride like the wind  
Fight proud, my son  
You're the defender  
God has sent  
  
Father, father, father  
I look up to you and heed thy call  
This letter ends my search  
I'll live your dream now passed on to me  
And I now wait to shake the hand of fate  
Like the dusk awaiting dawn  
  
So wizards cast your spell  
With no heart to do me well  
So it's written, it shall be  
  
Defender  
Ride like the wind  
Fight proud, my son  
You're the defender  
God has sent

They can't stop us  
Let 'em try  
For Heavy Metal  
We will die!  
  
Quit my job this morning sad forever  
I would hold my head up high  
Cause I need Metal in my life  
Just like an eagle needs to fly  
  
So I walked outside into the street  
From a hall I heard thunder and screams  
I walked inside so I could hear  
And the guy beside me gave me a beer  
  
He had his fist up in the air  
And called me brother said my friends  
Are over there  
  
They call themselves Immortals  
They're the truest of the true  
And in that very moment  
I was born again like you  
  
They said hold your head up high  
Raise your fist up in the air  
Play Metal louder than Hell  
Louder than Hell  
  
They can't stop us  
Let 'em try  
For Heavy Metal  
We will die!  
  
Brothers stand beside me, there's a battle on  
Know my words are true  
There's a battle for true Metal  
They're marching

Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go  
  
You can say I'm just a gringo  
You can say I'm just a man  
I live outside the law  
Doing anything I can  
  
I keep the laws I make  
And I break the laws you keep  
I'm living on the edge  
Living on the street  
  
Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go  
  
Each day I fight to live  
I fight to stay alive  
Don't get in my way  
Unless you want to die  
  
One who stands tall  
Never stands alone  
  
[Solo]  
  
Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Never taking me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go  
  
You can say I'm just a gringo  
You can say I'm just a man  
I live outside the law  
Doing anything I can  
  
I keep the laws I make  
And I break the laws you keep  
I'm living on the edge  
Living on the street  
  
Don't look for me in Heaven  
Don't look for me in Hell  
Heaven taken me alive  
I've got no soul to sell  
  
Don't look for me in prison  
Don't try to save my soul  
I'm a man without a country  
And I've got no place to go

Mama is having problems  
always comes to me  
Your daddy's been a drinker since 1943  
They tell you I'm a loser  
'Cause I like bein free  
But truth is in the mirror  
It's what they never see  
  
I sing Yeah  
Long time ago  
You tried to tell me, son  
keep our daughter home  
I said no no, no no  
  
Now, I don't mind them saying  
That you should be praying  
For me, fast taker  
Right here's where I'm staying  
Life's a game I play  
For keeps, fast taker, bed breaker, love maker  
Take it away  
  
Only sixteen  
a woman not a girl  
Old enough  
For a trip around the world  
Pick you up on Friday  
When daddy goes to sleep  
Bring you back on Sunday  
When he's watching "Billy Graham" on T.V.  
  
Oh yeah, he won't see me  
  
Now do it right with music  
Then you learn how to use it  
All night, fast taker  
Right here's where I'm staying  
Life's a game I play  
For keeps, fast taker, bed breaker, love maker  
Take it away

There's a sound heard across the land  
It's heard across the sea  
You'll only hear it if you listen with your hearts  
And one day hope to be free  
To hear the sound of freedom many gave their lives  
They fought for you and me  
Those memories will always live in silence  
And now it's our time to be free  
Where the eagles fly - I will soon be there  
If you want to - come along with me my friend  
Say the words and you'll be free  
From the mountains to the sea  
We'll fight for freedom again  
Scream out loud for all the world to hear  
From sea to shining sea ??  
Let freedom ring and every man be king  
To live as one through the years  
Now is the time we all must stand together  
So raise your hands show them we are strong  
Side by side the fight goes on forever  
Marching to the battle with this song  

Fight, fight, fight  
Fighting the World every single day  
Fighting the World for the right to play  
Heavy Metal in my brain  
I'm fighting for Metal cause it's here to stay  
  
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World  
I been fighting the World  
Fighting, fighting, fighting the World  
I been figthing  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World

Now people keep asking if we're going to change  
I look'em in the eye  
Tell'em no way  
Strips on a tiger don't wash away  
Manowar's made of steel not clay  
  
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World  
I been figthing the World  
Fighting,fighting,fighting the World  
I been figthing  
  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World  
Fight for a living-Fighting the World

Hear the pounding army of the night  
The call of metal summons us tonight.  
And gather we on this site  
To behold the power and the might.  
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night.  
  
Off with the lights, hear the screams  
See the banging heads awaken to their dreams.  
The sound of metal so loud it cracks the beams  
Played by warriors called the Metal Kings.  
  
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.  
We are together, we are all.  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand.  
Hands high forever we'll be there.  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight. Yea.  
  
A hero's welcome for those who heed the call.  
We are together, we are all.  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand.  
Hands high forever we'll be there,  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight.  
  
Leather, Metal, Spikes and Chains  
Gloves of Metal raised to show the brave.  
Into the darkness march the armies of the night.  
Bound by metal we live the fight.  
We wear leather, we wear spikes, we rule the night  
With hands high fists fill the air  
Against the world we stand.  
With hands high forever we'll be there,  
Gloves of Metal rule tonight!

Father obented me  
I ask thee  
Raise thy hand  
We! the sons of Odin!  
Await thy command  
Born!  
Under the sign  
Of the hammer we stand  
And here we all may die!  
Our blood on the ground  
The battle horns sound!  
Let thy Valkyries fly!!  
[Chorus:]  
Down from the sky into the fight  
Clutched full of rage!!  
Full of thunder  
And glory  
Swords in the wind  
Crossing the sky  
Lords of doom bring an end to their story  
Today is the day we Die in the fight  
None shall remain..  
Till last one for night  
Now Valhalla's calling us immortal  
We are gods immortal!  
We are Gods Of War!!  
Odin  
Hear the fallen wait  
To join thee  
By thy side  
Let Valhalla's gates  
Open wide.....  
Born! under the sign of the hammer  
They lived  
And here they fought and died!  
There blood on the ground..  
The battle horns sound!!  
Let thy Valkyries fly!!!  
[Chorus:]  
Down from the sky into the fight  
Clutched full of rage!!  
Full of thunder  
And glory  
Swords in the wind  
Crossing the sky  
Lords of doom bring an end to their story  
Today is the day we Die in the fight  
None shall remain..  
Till last one for night  
Now Valhalla's calling us immortal  
We are gods immortal!  
We are Gods Of War!!  
[Chorus]

Woooooooa!  
Wooooooooa!  
Woooooooooa!  
Woaaaa!  
Wooooa!!!!

We thank you for the cool aid, reverend jim  
We're glad to leave behind their world of sin  
Our lifeless bodies fall on holy ground  
Rotting flesh, a sacrificial mound  
  
Were you our God or a man in a play  
Who took our applause and forced us to stay  
Now all together we lived as we died  
On your command by your side  
  
Guyana in the cult of the damned  
Give us your word for the grand final stand  
Guyana in the cult of the damned  
Give us your word for the grand final stand  
  
In the cult of the damned we all worked the land  
Too afraid to look up we all feared his hand  
Hurry my children there isn't much time  
But we'll meet again on the other side  
Be good to the children and old people first  
Hand them a drink they're dying of thirst  
  
Bigfoot bigfoot thrown in a well  
Pulled under water screaming like hell  
He told us life was just a hotel  
Time to check out when he rang the bell  
  
Mother, mother

A hero was he  
Touching all our lives  
As if he lived and died  
In a single moment  
Great were his deeds  
All his words were true  
He lived and died  
A man of honor  
He paid with his life  
For his life was the price  
To pass the gates immortal  
Thy journey begins  
With sword in the wind  
Stay thy hand rest thy command  
For odin's call was heard above them all  
Thy name shall never die!  
Long shall we remember  
He who walked the road of danger  
Master of revenge  
Death's no stranger  
Blood and death lived on his sword  
The god of war his only lord  
Into the depths of hell  
Go all he fell  
Take thy shield take thy sword  
All thy weapons to the sky  
Ye shall need them when odin bid thee rise  
For none but the brave  
Shall rise up from the grave  
To see the valkyries fly  
And so it was by the hand of odin  
Did the immortal warrior pass through  
The gates of valhalla and into legend.  
Rise brother rise pass valhalla's gates  
Here great warriors await  
Reborn from thy steel  
All thy wounds be healed  
From the earth to the sky  
Now the son of odin rise!  
Take thy place among the kings  
For thy soul shall never die!  

Hear what's written on the wind.  
We come to kill and kill again.  
Our arrows fall like hail  
Trample on the dead. - Ride through the  
Gate of clouds - stand on the open step.  
  
Run beserk - spreading fear and pain.  
Black shield and weapons, black our chain.  
None can harm us - not their fire -  
Iron or steel - for we have the  
Will to power - with power we will  
Kill.  
  
Kill with power - die die  
Kill with power - die die  
  
To the war god Odin you will pray.  
And the curse of weapons shall  
Remain. On the blood of all our  
Fathers - on their weapons we now  
Swear to avenge - not lament.  
Give the False ones death.  
  
Kill with power - die die  
Kill with power - die die

Now Is The Time To Reach For The Sky  
Gather The Wind Hear The Voice To Fly  
To Know Why They Sing About Heroes And Kings  
Who Were Brave And Not Afraid To Die  
Look And You'll See That A New Day Will Bring  
The Will To Go On And Fight Trough Endless Suffering  
For All Who Believe Wait A Crown A Ring  
  
The Power Of The Man Who Would Be King  
The Power Of The Man Who Would Be King  
  
Into The Fight Of Hopes And Dreams  
The Master Of The Wind Knows Nothing's What It Seems  
The Melting Of The Soul The Wish Of Those Who Scheme  
The Taking Of The Will By Destroyers Of The Dream  
They Live To Spread The Fear Of The Wrong Of Right Of Self  
They Want Us All To Live Like Books Upon A Shelf  
But We Know We Have The Power To Fight And Make A Stand  
Strike When We Are Challenged All Across The Land To Be King  
  
Fight For The Crown, Fight For The Ring  
We're Fighting The World, We Fight For The King  
  
Time To Face The World Let Brothers Never Fight  
Forever Forge Ahead And Keep The Dream In Sight  
For Those Who Never Try They Are Sure To Fail  
The Heart's A Righteous Wind That Comes To Fill The Sail  
For The Glory Of The King We Fight To Stay Alive  
By The Power Of The Will, The Spirit To Survive To Be King  
  
Fight For The Crown, Fight For The Ring  
We're Fighting The World, We Fight For The King  
  
All Of The Dreams Held Deep Inside Have A Meaning To The Soul  
Freedom To Bring A Thought To The Wing Is Waiting To Unfold  
For The Crown And The Ring  
The Power Of The Men Who Would Be King  
  
Fight For The Crown, Fight For The Ring  
We're Fighting The World, We Fight For The King  
  
For The Glory Of The King We Fight To Stay Alive - FIGHT -  
By The Power Of The Will The Spirit To Survive - FIGHT -  
Across The Gates Of Heaven Beyond The Gates Of Hell - FIGHT -  
We Fought To Stay Together  
We Have Won And Have Lived To Tell Who Would Be King  
  
Fight For The Crown, Fight For The Ring  
We're Fighting The World, We Fight For The King

Voices of Victory  
All Shout and proclaim  
The Kingdom of Glory is mine  
The Raise of the will are a prophecy filled  
I'm the lord of the day and the night  
I have nothing to sell but the power of hell  
My Armies of fire awaits  
I'm here to be paid for the pact that was made  
My payments can never be late  
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder  
Man and beast will be torn asunder  
Into the Fight I own the right  
To be the King of kings  
My Enemies rise and look to the skies  
They Pray I will never appear  
The Light has no meaning  
Awake me I'm dreaming  
They live in a castle of fear  
I summon the demons that live in the wind  
As my Chariot strives in the Storm  
With the hot blood of Battle  
I wait in my saddle  
I live and I'll die by the sword  
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder  
Man and beast will be torn asunder  
Into the Fight I own the right  
To be the King of kings  
All the days of his life  
He walked without fear  
All who's lives he touched  
Were made better for knowing him  
As he returned goodness with good  
So too his justice and retribution unfailing  
As my sword is my soul  
Then let all who stand before me know  
I bring a storm and Magic wind  
The Kingdom of the Kings  
I summon the demons that live in the wind  
As my Chariot strives in the Storm  
With the hot blood of Battle  
I wait in the saddle  
I live and I'll die by the sword  
Crack the Earth, Gods of Thunder  
Men and beast will be torn asunder  
Into the Fight I own the right  
To be the King of kings  
  

See the white light  
The light within  
Be your own disciple  
Fan the sparks of will  
For all of us waiting  
Our kingdom has come  
  
Rays of power shining  
Rays of magic fall  
On the golden voice that speaks within us all  
For all of us waiting  
Your kingdom will come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Feel the white light  
The light within  
Yea it burns a fire that drives a man to win  
For all of us waiting  
Your kingdom will come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Words of power  
Calling to us all  
Holding us together while other kingdoms fall  
No longer waiting  
Our kingdom has come  
  
Kingdom Come  
  
Kingdom coming  
Another kingdom falls  
The rightful are waiting  
But all are not rightful  
Wait and receive the weight of the fall  
  
Kingdom Come

Manowar Manowar living on the road  
When we're in town speakers explode  
We don't attract wimps 'cause we're too loud  
Just true metal people that's Manowar's crowd  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they can't last  
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin'  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
  
We like it hard, we like it fast  
We got the biggest amps, man they blast  
True metal people want to rock not pose  
Wearin' jeans and leather, not cracker jack clothes  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they can't last  
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin'  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
Other bands play Manowar kill  
  
We're the kings of metal commin' to town  
When we light up, have the roof nailed down  
Don't try to tell us that we're too loud  
'Cause there ain't no way that we'll ever turn down  
  
They want to keep us down  
But they can't last  
When we get up we're gonna kick your ass  
Gonna keep on burnin'  
We always will  
Other bands play Manowar kill

We met on English ground  
in a backstage room  
We heard the sound  
And we all knew what we had to do  
  
We called the high command  
Requested leave to make a stand  
And in the field we grew  
And we all knew  
  
Soon the time would come  
For us to fight,  
Destination  
now in sight  
  
Oooh, Manowar  
Born to live forever more  
The right to conquer every shore  
Hold your ground and give no more  
  
Our fight will never end  
So we called on partisans  
To raise your hands  
And take our stand  
  
Look sharp  
when duty calls  
Where we march  
cities fall  
And the strong survive  
And take our side

Ride, ride, ride, ride up from hell  
  
Armed with magic sons of demons and men  
This song of greeting written for your tragic end.  
So long our stride the world doth tremble with fear  
Black winds blow where we ride near.  
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.  
  
Hot pitch and chain take to the air  
Our ramming blades lay their ships hold bare.  
Steel meets steel, axes, broadsword and shield.  
Their heads ride our spears and bodies cover the fields.  
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.  
  
Fallen brother as I hold closed your side  
I fear this wound your last.  
Mighty earth now doth drink your blood  
And I remember days long past.  
Your sacrifice so great, rest now take thy sleep  
For you shall not awake, let revenge be sweet.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
For when we march, your sword rides with me.  
  
You who killed my brother and all who take your side  
This be your last hour. Let your steel be tried.  
Now turn to face me upon the timeless plane  
Kill me if you can.  
  
Death is life!  
  
By the full moon they rise from their graves.  
Through seas of blood, fighting with hell bent rage.  
Swear the creed of unity, by the circle of blood  
We are one, we know not fear! Born to fight not run.  
Maim and kill them, take the women and children.

In the silence of the darkness when all are fast asleep  
I live inside your dreams calling to your spirit  
As the sail calls the wind, here the angels sing.  
Far behind the sun, across the western sky  
Reach to the blackness, find a silver line  
In a voice I whisper a candle in the night  
Will carry all our dreams on a single beam of light.  
  
Close your eyes, look into the dreams  
Winds of changes will winds of fortune bring.  
  
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky  
Gold is at the end for each of us to find.  
There the road begins where another one will end,  
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend  
All to be the Master of the wind.  
  
Falling stars now light my way my life has written on the wind  
Clouds above, clouds below, high ascend between the spirit  
When the wind fills the sky and clouds will move aside,  
There will be a road to all our dreams and for every day that stings  
Two better days it brings, nothing is as bad as it seems.  
  
Close your eyes, look into the dreams  
Winds of change will winds of fortune bring.  
  
Fly away to a rainbow in the sky  
Gold is at the end for each of us to find.  
There the road begins where another one will end  
Here the four winds know who will break and who will bend  
All to be the Master of the wind.

Every one of us has heard the call  
Brothers of True Metal proud and standing tall  
We know the power within us has brought us to this hall  
there's magic in the metal there's magic is us all  
  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers go on get out  
Leave the hall  
  
Now the world must listen to our decree  
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please  
got to make it louder, all men play on ten  
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend  
  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers leave the hall  
Heavy metal or no metal at all whimps and posers I said  
Leave the hall  
  
Now the world must listen to our decree  
We don't turn down for anyone we do just what we please  
Got to make it louder, all men play on ten  
If you're not into metal, you are not my friend  
  
There's metal in the air tonite, can you hear it call  
If you ain't got the balls, to take it you can  
Leave the hall

Demon's blood and dragon fire, falling on my wings  
Racing to the battle in the sky  
Ancient gods are calling me I hear them when they sing  
Of all the heroes who wait for me to die  
  
Beneath the cloak of magic, I'll meet them in the air  
I am invisible, I move without a sound  
They look but cannot find me, they think that I'm not there  
With a spell I send them crashing to the ground  
  
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn  
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm  
We must die to be reborn  
  
I wear a sacred talisman, I make a secret sign  
Now welcome me into this wicked wind  
On the journey of a shaman a dragon I must ride  
The gates of hell are open! Let me in!  
  
Rule in hell or serve in heaven choose an altar or throne  
All Commandments and the laws of man disown  
Now eat the fruit of knowledge unto no one ye atone  
Into the fire with your soul!  
  
Wait for me dragon, we'll meet in the sky by fire and magic I am sworn  
Hell is calling! We cannot be denied fly to the blackness of the storm  
We must die to be reborn

Atop the mountain, where the river of steel flows  
Black is the forest, white was the snow.  
There as children, how could children know?  
One without name or number soon would show.  
  
There stood he, on his chariot made of gold  
He did reveal the trinity of secrets old.  
  
A sceptre of iron could mercy bring.  
A shield of gold, the Creator and king,  
And the great sword of steel.  
  
Sons of destiny shall wield.  
Hear Wisdom's voice.  
Rise, know the strength that you feel.  
Hold in your heart, but never reveal  
You were called by the Gods, their powers to wield.  
Guard well the secret of steel.

Into the hands of Four sworn to ride

Like so many before me I'll die with honor and pride  
The right of a warrior forever to fight by your side  
  
Send a sign raise the sail wave a last goodbye  
Destiny is calling immortality be mine  
  
Call the witch to cast the runes, weave a magic spell  
We who die in battle are born not for heaven not for hell  
  
We are Sons of Odin the fire we burn inside  
Is the legacy of warrior kings who reign above in the sky  
  
I will lead the charge my sword into the wind  
Sons of Odin fight to die and live again  
Viking ships cross the sea, in cold wind, and rain  
Sail into the black of night magic stars our guiding light  
  
Today the blood of battle upon my weapons will never dry  
Many I'll send into the ground laughing as they die

From a battle I've come  
To a battle I ride  
Blazing up to the sky  
Chains of fate  
Hold a firey stride  
I'll see you again when I die  
  
High and mighty alone we are kings  
Whirlwinds of fire we ride  
Providence brought us the crown and the ring  
Covered with blood and our pride  
  
Heroes await me  
My enemies ride fast  
Knowing not this ride's their last  
Saddle my horse as I drink my last ale  
Bow string and steel will prevail  
  
High and mighty alone we are kings  
Whirlwinds of fire we ride  
Providence brought us the crown and the ring  
Covered with blood and our pride  
  
Odin I await thee

The oath of the Gods, this day was fulfilled  
In the hear of the battle, Hector was killed  
See him Patroclus, down in the dust  
Rejoice in his death my aymbol of trust  
A dozen highborn youths, have been killed  
Cutting their throats their blood was all spilled  
Their bodies set at the foot of your fire  
With oxen , sheep and two of yours hounds  
Your funeral Pyre high off the ground  
Hector's body dragged three times around  
I will carry the torch to your funeral Pyre  
I will ask of the wind to send high your fire  
Hector's blood will not be washed from my body  
Until your body is burned  
A prophecy spoken a promise fulfilled  
More blood will be spilled, more will be killed

In The Beginning There Was Silence And Darkness  
All Across The Earth  
Then Came The Wind And A Hole In The Sky  
Thunder And Lightning Came Crashing Down

Fire Burned High In The Sky  
  
From Down Below Fire Melted The Stone  
The Ground Shook And Started To Pound

The seven red flames of the cave  
Are lightning the horrible torture  
Constricted to see the regrets  
To have had the life from his god  
Airin sheds black tears supporting the terrible rape  
The fury of the sons of the thunder  
Is breaking the mystical chain  
  
Arwald falls so to his knees  
While Akron the black king is laughing  
The princess falls down on the stones  
With no breath of life anymore  
May your ambition lead you to the unholy name  
So my soul will fight you forever  
In one of the many new hells  
  
From the holy sea of golden flames  
Flies the last winged unicorn  
With it's magic breath of innocence  
Rising to the crystal throne  
  
Skies are spitting holy fire wisdom cries and deadly whispers flow  
Flow down to silent mystic shores  
Shores of the spirits thirst for vengeance waiting for their holy crystal gate  
Gate to the sunny holy lands  
  
"Lands of a timeless world...  
An enchanted timeless world like no other...  
There where magic flowers paint the cosmic landscape  
And noone knows the word... pain!"  
Tears of blood and sadness formed the wonderful silent lake  
Swans and birds in water games will call Airin's name... her name!  
  
And now is the time to decide  
On a way to escape from the cavern  
The old silver chains on the wall  
Are now also trapping their souls  
Airin my princess I can not endure all my pain  
But I swear to you on my proud name...  
You'll open the mystical gate!  
  
From the holy sea of golden flames  
Flies the last winged unicorn  
With it's magic breath of innocence  
Rising to the crystal throne  
  
From the holy sea of golden flames  
Flies the last winged unicorn  
With it's magic breath of innocence  
Rising to the crystal throne

In the nights  
We take flights  
Witness the sites  
The power and glory of steel  
  
I fought and died  
Lived many lives before  
I am immortal like my sword  
I kneel to no one except the lord  
And my lord is steel  
  
If you see me you just passed your time  
To the hills you can run but not hide  
Blood and death are wherever I ride  
Armed for battle the lord on my side  
Stand and face the lord of steel  
The lord of steel  
  
In the eyes of the lord you have sinned  
Let your punishment begin  
Only by death you atone  
You shall not die alone  
  
For the glory of battle  
I will fight until I die  
Live one day as an eagle  
Or a lifetime as a fly  
Like a candle burning  
The wheels of time are turning  
The lord of steel commands you  
To die by my hand  
  
Stand and fight the lord of steel  
Time to face the lord of steel

Burning embers of the second death will come in the night  
Priests and kings, the alpha and omega, poison bites  
False prophets and deceivers swing from the trees  
Now dawn the age of birds  
Drunk with blood, like lepers with disease  
Lord of the sky Mercury the guide  
Lord of the underworld, I swear the sacred right  
I will crucify, slay them with their tribe  
Hear my war cry  
  
They'll find no sanctuary hidden in their ancestral halls  
Let loose the knot that binds the spirit and flesh  
Let it fall  
For only courage and heroism linger after death  
So, hold fast thy sword, rejecting pain, feel the dragons  
Breath  
  
I've sworn the oath

I've Got The Power To Fly Into The Wind  
The Power To Be Free To Die And Live Again  
This Power's Like Fire, Fire Loves To Burn  
Make The World A Grave Of Ashes In A Urn  
The Power In The Darkness To See Without My Sight  
Walk Among The Living Free From Wrong And Right  
The Power Of The Magic The Power Of The Spell  
Not To Serve In Heaven But One Day Rule In Hell  
  
Power The Power The Power  
  
This Power's Greater Than Love And Of Hate  
This Is The Power Of Will And Of Fate  
The Power Of Blood The Triumph Of Steel  
Greater Than The Power Of A Priest Or A Sinner  
The Power To Defy To Fight And Be The Winner  
The Power Of The Demons Spirits I Command  
Always By My Side To Serve The Master's Plan  
  
Power The Power The Power  
  
None Can Fight The Power None Can Fight The Wind  
Secrets Of All Life And Death Are Carried There Within  
Call Out To The Power Of The Darkness And Light  
Have Dominion Of The Earth Be Lord Of All The Night  
Kill All Those Who Stand Against You Look Into Their Eyes  
Drink Their Blood And Laugh As They Pay For All Their Lies  
Piss Upon Their Grave Then Cast A Final Spell  
Fly Into The Night One Day Meet In Hell  
  
Power The Power The Power

Lord of battle I pray on bended knee conquest by the rising sun  
I'll wait for thy command with flame and blood at hand  
glory and a broken sword.  
  
I'm the master of the world I have no fear of man or beast  
Born inside the soul of the world  
Riding hard breaking bone with steel and stone  
Eternal might I was born to wield.  
  
Let us drink to the battles we've lived and we've fought  
Celebrate the pain and havoc we have wrought  
Great heroes charge into the fight  
From the north to the south in the black of night  
  
The clash of honor calls to stand when others fall  
Gods of war feel the power of my sword

With blood in my voice I scream as you die  
Thirsting for vengeance and mounds of the slain  
Shaking the forest onto the plain  
  
Fierce is my blade fierce is my hate born to die in battle  
I laugh at my fate  
Now pay in blood when your blood has been spilled  
You're never forgiven death is fulfilled !

The trail of tears began for all the Cherokee  
The white men came to trade and borrow  
But then they would not leave  
Some of us were taken by boat, and died at sea  
Those of us who lived were sold to slavery  
We welcomed them as brothers, knowing nothing of their greed  
Born hunters not the hunted, as the white man hunts for me  
We are descendants of the animals we live among them free  
Our trail of tears would end, one day at wounded knee  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
When we do the ghost dance, the buffalo will return  
Paint ourselves for war now blood and fire burn  
Great spirit makes us strong, take us to the sky  
The Cherokee are brave, we are not afraid to die  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
Red cloud, black hawk, sitting bull  
Crazy horse, Geronimo  
Strong and brave  
Warriors to the grave  
There has been much killing  
There will be much more  
The medicine man is dancing  
He's calling us to war  
Hatchets sing with pride  
Let the white men die  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  
Great spirit, thunder birds fly  
We are wild and free  
To fight and die by the open sky  
Spirit horse ride for me  

Grand father, tell me a story!  
All right, go and get your storybook  
No, no, not one of those, a real story  
A real story?  
Yes! Tell me about when you were a boy  
Well, then, I shall have to take you back with me  
A long way in time  
It was my thirteenth year on a cold winter's day  
As I walked through the enchanted forest  
I heard the sounds of horses and men at arms  
I felt compelled to walk on and find the place of these sounds  
And when the forest did clear I was standing on a hill  
Before me there was a great plane  
Upon it the armies of the world,standing, waiting  
I thought to myself, for whom or for what are they waiting?  
Suddenly a gust of wind come up from the north  
There appeared a lone rider, holding a sword of steel  
Then from the south came another, bearing a battle axe  
From the east came a third, holding a spiked club  
And finally, from the west a rider  
Who wielded a great hammer of war, with them came their  
Soldiers of death, followed by an army of immortals  
They were few in number  
But the look in their eyes told all who beheld them  
That they would leave this day only in victory or death  
And there was a great silence  
My heart began to pound, storm clouds filled the sky with darkness  
Rain came and four winds blew with such anger  
That I held fast to a tree  
I watched the four riders raise their weapons into the air  
Without warning, screaming their war cry they led the attack  
Down to the battle they rode  
They met the armies of the world with a mighty clash  
I could feel the groundshake, the earth drank much blood that day  
Each of the four, was into himself a whirlwind of doom  
When the smoke did clear, many thousands were dead  
There was much blood and gore  
Their bodies lay broken and scattered across the battle field  
Like brown leaves blown by the wind  
And I saw the four ride together to the top of the hill  
While below them the soldiers of death assembled  
All those who would now swear allegiance to them  
And the four spoke the words of the warriors prayer  
Gods of war I call you, my sword is by my side  
I seek a life of honor free from all false pride  
I will crack the whip with a bold mighty hail  
Cover me with death if I should ever fail  
Glory, majesty, unity, hail, hail,hail  
And as I stood and looked on, I heard the armies of the world  
Hail them without end, and their voices of victory  
Carried long and far throughout the land  
Well, That's it, did you like the story?  
Yeah, it was great!  
Oh, good, I'm glad, now off to bed with you  
Grandfather?  
Yes?  
Who were those four men?  
Who were they? They were the Metal Kings

Black clouds on the horizon  
Great thunder and burning rain  
His chariot pounding,  
I heard the heavens scream his name  
  
I watched as he shouted  
To the giants that died that day  
He hehd up his hammer high  
And called to odin for a sign  
  
Thor the mighty, thor the brave  
Crush the infidels in your way  
By your hammer let none be saved  
Live to die on that final day  
Gods, monsters and men  
Well die together in the end  
  
God of thunder, God of rain  
Earth shaker who feels no pain  
The powerhead of the universe  
Now send your never ending curse  
  
Swing your hammer to crack the sky  
Lift your cape so that you might fly  
Back to odin and the gods on high  
And leave this mortal world

Back to Odin and the gods on high  
And leave the mortal world  
  
Thor the mighty Thor the brave  
Crush the infidels in your way  
By your hammer let none be saved  
Live to die on that final day  
Gods monsters and men  
Will die together in the end  
  
Odin

When you see me comin' flying down the road  
You know I ain't afraid to lay it down  
Yea got me some leather. Leather is my skin  
Black n chrome flashin' through the town.  
Some call me the WARLORD 'cause I'm a GOD-DAMN  
bad machine, young n hungry, not too proud n mean  
  
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,  
Riding, riding, riding, ain't never growin old.  
  
Take what I want and I go where I please  
Got the world right by the balls. This world ain't  
big enough to keep me down. Yea we're livin'  
in a sick world. The man on the T.V. said we  
got lotsa trouble overseas, well what the hell  
do I care? Think they care about me?  
Stop sending money send em all a bomb.  
  
Ride, ride, ride, I'm the WARLORD of the road,  
Ridin, ridin, ridin, ain't never growin old.  
  
Born to live in the fast lane on a chopped up  
Harley-D, smell that oil and high test gasoline.  
Never got a shortage of girls to share my seat.  
Well they all want to know what people say is true,  
You know, get a biker started n he'll drive all  
damn night. Well hold on honey cause this ride's  
for a ride.  
  
Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride  
I'm the WARLORD of the road.  
Riding, ridin, ridin, ain't never growin old.

Since the dawn of time  
I've rolled across the earth  
Spinning in the dust  
Long before your birth  
Eating tar and gasoline  
Every light I see is green  
Open pipes, my machine's triple-plated chrome  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride  
  
Motors running  
Now you're gonna learn  
Waiting on the line  
Make your tires burn  
Fast, faster, faster, faster  
Speeding always kills  
Nothing else takes us to get these thrills  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride  
  
Blood and thunder on the road  
My heart is pounding  
My blood is nitroglycerine  
I'm fire  
Burning, burning, burning, burning  
Ready to explode  
Don't want nothing left of me to scrape off the road  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride  
  
Clouds of smoke  
Tires screaming  
Fire in my hair  
Blown into a thousand pieces  
Scattered everywhere  
Fast, burn, burning, faster  
want to take a ride  
Spirit of the wheel  
Wheels of fire ride  
  
Spirit of the wheel  
  
Wheels of fire burn the night  
Ride across the sky  
Wheels of fire burning bright  
We live to ride
