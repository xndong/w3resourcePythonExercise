You can go but be back soon  
You can go but while you're working,  
This place I'm pacing round,  
Until you're home safe and sound  
Fare well but be back soon  
Who can tell where danger's lurking  
Do not forget this tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
How could we forget  
How could we let  
Our dear old Fagin worry  
We love him so we'll come back home  
In a such a great big hurry  
  
It's him who plays the piper,  
It's the one that pipes his tune!  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
You can go but be back soon,  
You can go but bring back plenty,  
Of pocket hankerchieves  
And you should be clever thieves  
Whip it quick and be back soon  
There's a sixpence here for twenty  
Ain't that a lovely tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
Our pockets'll hold a watch of gold  
That chimes upon the hour!  
A wallet fat  
An old man's hat,  
  
The crown jewels from the tower!  
We know the bow street runners,  
But they don't know this tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
Cheerio but be back soon,  
I don't know somehow I'll miss yya  
I love ya that's why I  
Say cheerio not goodbye  
Don't be gone long be back soon  
Give me one long last god bless ya  
Remember our old tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
We must disappear, we'll be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrow  
We'll miss you too,  
  
It's sad but true  
That picking  
Is such sweet sorrow!  
  
And when we're in the distance,  
You'll hear this whispered tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
We must disappear  
We'll be back here  
Today perhaps tomorrrow  
We'll miss you too  
It's sad but true  
That parting is such sweet sorrow!  
And when we're in the distance  
You'll hear this whispered tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
Cheerio but be back soon  
I don't know somehow I'll miss you  
I love you that's why I  
Say cheerio not goodbye  
Don't be gone long be back soon  
Give me one long last god bless you  
Remember our old tune,  
Be back soon!  
  
And when we're in the distance  
You'll hear this whispered tune,  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
So long fare well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!  
  
So long fare the well, pip pip cheerio  
We'll be back soon!

The sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
When did you lose that big bright smile  
I used to love so well?  
Where did she go, that happy child  
I guess it's hard to tell  
  
Well, maybe I've been too close to see  
How far apart we've grown  
But you can put the blame on me  
Although you should've known  
That the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
Where did you find that point of view  
You love to point at me?  
I'd like to know what happened to  
The two we used to be  
  
Well, maybe the rain's about to fall  
You'd best believe it's here  
But the weatherman says that overall  
The air is beginning to clear  
And the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
Now, baby the rain's about to fall  
You'd best believe it's here  
But the weatherman says that overall  
The air is beginning to clear  
And the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
My love  
  
Well, the sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love  
  
The sweetest songs are never sung  
Better days are yet to come  
Yet to come my love

Speak softly, closely, love  
Warm breath stirs will for life  
Of any tremblin' dove  
Wounded by word or knife  
  
A kiss on closed eyes  
I forever will see  
Kiss them now  
Comfort me  
Oh oh oh  
  
Walk ever quietly, dear  
Don't wake the sleeping dog  
He makes disquieting fear  
He rests beyond the fog  
  
Sweet balm of dark  
Lie here tenderly  
Cover all  
Comfort me  
Oh oh oh  
  
Bathe me in clouds, my love  
Clean crust of tiresome day  
Drink cool and blue, my love  
Don't let us float away  
  
Lighter than air the body must be  
Dance with grace  
Comfort me  
Oh oh oh  
  
Speak softly, closely, love  
Warm breath stirs will for life  
Of any tremblin' dove  
Wounded by word or knife  
  
A kiss on closed eyes  
I forever will see  
Kiss them now  
Comfort me  
Me  
Comfort me

Is it worth the waiting for,  
If we live till eighty-four  
All we ever get is gruel,  
Every day we say our prayers  
Will they change the bill of fair?  
Still we get the same old gruel  
There's not a crust not a crumb  
Can we find can we beg can we borrow or cadge,  
But there's nothing to stop us from getting a thrill,  
When we all close our eyes and imagine,  
  
Food glorious food  
Hot sausage and mustard  
While we're in the mood cold jelly and custard  
Pease pudding and saveloys  
What next is the question?  
Rich gentlemen have it boys  
In-Di-Gestion  
  
Food glorious food  
What is there more handsome  
Gulped swallowed or chewed  
Still worth a kings ransom  
What is it we dream about?  
What brings on a sigh?  
Piled peaches and cream about six feet high  
  
Food glorious food  
Were anxious to try it  
3 banquets a day  
Our favourite diet  
Just picture a great big steak fried, roasted or stewed  
Oh food marvelous food wonderful food magical food fabulous food beautiful
food  
Glorious food

The old man stopped and thought  
Well, now I'm 85  
And while I'm still alive  
I must rectify a few things  
  
I never dreamed way back when I was 21  
There'd be so much left undone  
And I would never grow wings  
Should there be a need to delay my certain sunset  
Will there be a plan for me to try?  
  
I know the only way to fly  
I must find a golden eagle  
Resting somewhere on the ground  
And ride him ever westward  
Never see the sun go down  
  
Sometimes the challenge presses hard upon my brow  
And I know the time is now  
But my wits are stiff and swollen  
I pay my dues and limp a rough and rocky climb  
As I try to buy some time  
Before the dark has fallen  
  
I am but a man  
Can I stop encroaching shadows?  
Would that I could keep the black away  
I have a scheme to save the day  
  
I will find a golden eagle  
Resting somewhere on the ground  
And ride him ever westward  
Never see the sun go down  
And I'll ride him for circles  
A hundred million times  
And then if I have finished  
All the half-done chores that I'm now facing  
I'll bring him on home

I'm awake in the afternoon, I fell asleep in the living room  
It's one of those moments when everything is so clear  
before the truth goes back into hidding  
I wanna decide cause it's worth deciding  
to work on finding something more than fear  
It takes so much out of me to pretend  
tell me now tell me how  
Make amens  
  
Maybe, I need to see the daylight  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately.... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
is there really no escape, no escape from time  
of any kind  
  
I keep trying to understand  
this thing and that thing my felo man  
I guess i'll let you know when I figure it out  
I don't mind a few mysteries they can stay that away  
It's fine by me but you are another mystery I am missing  
It takes too much out of me to pretend  
  
Maybe I need to see the day light  
live beyond the half life  
don't you see I'm breaking down  
O, lately... Something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
Is there really no escape, no escape from time  
or any kind  
  
C'mon lets fall in love  
well c'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets.... Fall in love.... Again  
  
Cause lately, something here don't feel right  
this is just a half life  
without you I get breaking down  
O, wake me  
I wanna see the day light  
save me from this half life  
let you and I escape  
escape from time  
  
C'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets fall in love  
c'mon lets fall in love....... Again

[Widow corney (spoken)]  
You're a cruel man.  
And a hardhearted man besides.  
  
[Mr. Bumble(spoken)]  
Hardhearted, Mrs. Corney? Hard?  
Are you hardhearted, Mrs. Corney?  
  
[Widow corney (spoken)]  
Dear me! What a curious question coming  
From a single man.  
What can you want to know  
For, Mr. Bumble? Mr. Bumble, I shall scream!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
No you wouldn't, heigh ho.  
If I wanted something special,  
Then you couldn't say "no".  
Did I nearly catch you smiling?  
Yes I did. And it's beguiling.  
If you hand is close, I'll press it.  
Yes, you like it -- come confess it!  
Yes, you do...  
  
[Widow corney]  
No, I don't.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Yes, you do!  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream! I shall scream!  
'Til they hasten to my rescue, I shall scream.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Since there's nobody that's near us  
Who could see us. Or could hear us?  
If you ask you can I kiss you  
Say what will my pretty miss do?  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream, scream, scream!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
If I pinch you one pinch -  
From you shy protective shell  
Can I un-inch you one inch?  
Will my blinthesome, buxum beauty  
Let her suitor do his duty?  
Tho' his lap ain't very large, dear  
Sit upon it - There's no charge, dear.  
Will you sit?  
  
[Widow corney]  
No, I shan't  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Will you sit?  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream! I shall scream!  
For the safety of my virtue I shall scream  
Tho' your knee is rather cosy,  
See my cheeks are getting rosy.  
You would have me in your power.  
If I sat here for an hour...  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
I shall scream, scream, scream!  
  
[Widow corney]  
You're a naughty bad man.  
If you think I can't be proper,  
Prim and haughty - I can  
And you'll pardon if I mention  
You must state your true intention.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
Is there not another room here?  
  
[Widow corney]  
No!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
If there would be a bride and groom here - would there be?  
  
[Widow corney]  
Well there might.  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
We shall see.  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream! I shall scream!  
At the thought of what you're thinking, I shall scream!  
  
[Mr. Bumble]  
You will wonder where the scream went  
When we Come to an agreement  
As my lovey-dovey is chubby  
Could she love a chubby hubby  
  
[Widow corney]  
I shall scream, Mr. Bumble!  
I shall scream, Bumble-Wumble!  
I shall scream, scream, scream!

There are places I remember all my life  
Though some have changed  
Some forever not for better  
Some have gone and some remain  
  
All these places had their moments  
With lovers and friends  
I still can recall  
Some are dead and some are living  
In my life I've loved them all  
  
But of all these friends and lovers  
There is no one compares with you  
And these memories lose their meaning  
When I think of love as something new  
  
Though I know  
I'll never lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know I'll often stop and think about them  
In my life I love you more  
  
Though I know  
I'll never lose affection  
For people and things that went before  
I know I'll often stop and think about them  
In my life I love you more  
In my life I love you more

Jean, Jean, roses are red  
All the leaves have gone green  
And the clouds are so low  
You can touch them, and so  
Come out to the meadow, Jean  
  
Jean, Jean, you're young and alive  
Come out of your half-dreamed dream  
And run, if you will, to the top of the hill  
Open your arms, bonnie Jean  
  
Till the sheep in the valley come home my way  
Till the stars fall around me and find me alone  
When the sun comes a-singin' I'll still be waitin'  
  
For Jean, Jean, roses are red  
And all of the leaves have gone green  
While the hills are ablaze with the moon's yellow haze  
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean  
  
(Jean, Jean)  
Jean, you're young and alive!!  
Come out of your half-dreamed dream  
And run, if you will to the top of the hill  
Come into my arms, bonnie Jean  
  
Jean  
  
La-la-la-la, etc.

The distance  
(oliver james)  
  
The sky has lost it's color  
The sun has turned to gray  
At least that's how it feels to me  
Whenever you're away  
  
I crawl up in the corner  
To watch the minutes pass  
Each one brings me closer to  
The time you're coming back  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't take the distance  
I can't take the miles  
I can't take the time until I next see you smile  
I can't take the distance  
And I'm not ashamed  
That with every breath I take I'm calling your name  
I can't take the distance  
  
I still believe my feelings  
But sometimes I feel too much  
I make believe you're close to me  
But it ain't close enough  
Not nearly close enough  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't take the distance  
I can't take the miles  
I can't take the time until I next see you smile  
I can't take the distance  
And I'm not ashamed  
That with every breath I take I'm calling your name  
  
I'd breathe fire and I'd be free  
To be by your side, I'd do anything  
I can't take the distance  
  
I will go the distance  
I will go the miles  
That's how much you mean to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can't take the distance  
I can't take the miles  
I can't take the time until I next see you smile  
I can't take the distance  
And I'm not ashamed  
That with every breath I take I'm calling your name  
I can't take the distance

"What's gone wrong with Mary?"  
I hear them say  
Mary's not the Mary of yesterday  
She's gone to changin' her hair  
And she laughs and she cries  
And her life seems to be  
Such a worried and jumbled affair  
  
Well, I have talked to Mary  
I've searched her eyes  
And if you ask of Mary  
I'll tell you why  
It's Mary's time to run  
Through the mad, through the sane,  
Through the joy and the pain  
'Til she finds her place in the sun  
  
Young birds fly in early spring  
They learn new songs to sing  
And each song they know  
Can help them to grow  
  
Mary questions everything  
She's ever known before  
And want her as we may  
She just won't listen anymore  
But let her find a way  
And soon'll come a glorious day  
When everything's been sorted through  
The streets will be reported  
How people congregate to feel the love within her heart  
And to listen to the music in her mind  
  
Young birds fly in early spring  
They learn new songs to sing  
Young birds fly in early spring  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Young birds fly in early spring  
They learn new songs to sing  
Young birds fly in early spring  
  
(Young birds fly in early spring  
Oh oh oh oh  
Young birds fly in early spring)  
  
Young birds go on and fly away  
Fly  
Go on and fly  
Fly away

[Fagin (spoken)]  
You see, Oliver...  
  
[sung] In this life, one thing counts  
In the bank, large amounts  
I'm afraid these don't grow on trees,  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys,  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Large amounts don't grow on trees.  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin (spoken)]  
Let's show Oliver how it's done, shall we, my dears?  
  
[sung] Why should we break our backs  
Stupidly paying tax?  
Better get some untaxed income  
Better to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Why should we all break our backs?  
Better pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin (spoken)]  
Who says crime doesn't pay?  
  
[sung] Robin Hood, what a crook!  
Gave away, what he took.  
Charity's fine, subscribe to mine.  
Get out and pick-a-pocket or two  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Robin Hood was far too good  
He had to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin]  
Take a tip from Bill Sikes  
He can whip what he likes.  
I recall, he started small  
He had to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
We can be like old Bill Sikes  
If we pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin (spoken)]  
Stop thief!  
  
Dear old gent passing by  
Something nice takes his eye  
Everything's clear, attack the rear  
Get in and pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Have no fear, attack the rear  
Get in and pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Fagin]  
When I see someone rich,  
Both my thumbs start to itch  
Only to find some peace of mind  
We have to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two, boys  
You've got to pick-a-pocket or two.  
  
[Boys]  
Just to find some peace of mind  
  
[Fagin and boys]  
We have to pick-a-pocket or two!
