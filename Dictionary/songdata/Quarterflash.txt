It's just too easy to hide in these trees  
Rust in this water up to your knees  
Not many dreamers ever get out alive  
Some kind of sickness sleeps in this town  
I barely got out, but so many drown  
The more you struggle,  
The faster you're gonna sink  
You're shakin', you're shakin' the jinx  
You're beating the odds by the skin of your teeth  
Baby, baby, it's a long way down  
They want to be there when you hit the ground  
You gotta shake it right in their face and smile  
And when you've got 'em right in the palm of your hand  
You don't need 'em 'cause you understand  
So you turn slowly and you give the boys one last wink  
And then...  
You're shakin', you're shakin' the jinx  
You're beating the odds by the skin of your teeth  
  
You gotta face the fools who put sand in the gears  
You gotta shake a fist at a thousand different fears  
You gotta break it, fake it  
But never let 'em know what you think  
While...  
You're shakin', you're shakin' the jinx  
You're beating the odds by the skin of your teeth

They'll shine a light in your eyes  
They'll set you up with their lies, sweet lies  
Shane, if you leave me, they'll hurt you believe me  
And something inside you will die-  
  
I know the reason you bleed  
I understand what you need, and you need me  
Babe, I can help you, think of nights that I held you  
And only I can make you sleep  
  
Shane, Shane, no one will hide you  
Like the one that cries your name-  
Shane nobody wants you  
Like the one that haunts your dreams  
  
I know the voices you hear  
I know the secrets you fear  
Dreams that will wake you, faces that shake you  
Remember that I've always been near  
  
Forget the love that I gave you  
Forget the child that I saved  
Only I know your heartbeat, only I know your backstreets  
And only I can take you away

Saw my father living in a picture  
Squinting in the Michigan sun  
'Caught forever in his blouse and knickers  
Wasn't he the lucky one?  
While the fear is growing stronger  
The sun is almost gone  
So hold me in your naked eye  
And shoot me on the run  
  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another picture  
Please, please freeze my features  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another  
I don't want to fade away  
  
I saw a picture hidden in the bedroom  
Underneath father's ties  
A beautiful woman caught naked forever  
Black strip over her eyes  
I still remember that picture  
The image sits sharp and clear  
And I'll never erase that eyeless face  
Still smiling all these years  
  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another picture  
Please, please freeze my features  
Oh, won't you please, please  
Take another  
I don't want to fade away

You won't forget my eyes  
Ooh deep inside you realize  
You're gonna see me wherever you go  
You're gonna hear me on your radio  
There you are in your car  
You hear a voice that's calling  
"Do you want me  
Do you want me"  
  
Take me to heart  
I promise you a miracle  
Take me to heart  
You're gonna be mine  
Take me to heart  
You know it's just a matter of time  
  
I'm always on your mind  
I'm the chill that never left your spine  
In the building where you live and breathe  
I'm the sound that never lets you sleep  
Down the hall through the walls  
You hear a voice that's calling  
"Do you want me  
Do you want me"  
  
Take me to heart  
Don't deny the miracle  
Take me to heart  
What more can I say  
Take me to heart  
Surrender's just a motion away

There's some out there tonight  
Who's lost and lonely, too  
There's a heart beating just with mine  
There's a voice in the air  
But it just can't get through  
I'm hoping that someday I'll find someone  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart  
  
There's a song in the air,  
But I can't hear the words  
There's a promise that's never made  
There's a voice in the streets  
That no one's ever heard  
I'm hoping I'll hear it someday calling  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart  
  
Somewhere there's a voice that's calling  
Someone who's alone and falling  
I don't want to wait here anymore, lonely  
I can't face another closing door  
  
Talk to me, open up your heart  
Oh love's so lonely when you're in the dark  
Talk to me, take it from the start  
Oh, love comes easy when you show your heart

I walk on ice  
I play with fire  
For loving you, baby  
I dance on wire  
Oh I can't sleep at night  
Loving you I pay that price  
Loving you is like walking on ice  
  
Who broke you down  
Who's there to blame  
Who tore you up inside  
And left the pain  
Oh, someone burned your life  
And everyday I pay that price  
Everyday I'm walking on ice  
  
Time after time I wake up and find  
I want you, I'm calling  
Like always I'm falling on ice  
Walking on ice  
  
I can't blink an eye  
Loving you I pay that price  
Loving you is like walking on ice

Two dollar tips and the lipstick cigarettes  
Get yourself a job with your fingertips  
Too many tickets for the backseat matinee  
Two hours later and you're looking for another face  
Don't ask for love  
Don't ask for pity  
Don't ask for me  
Welcome to the city  
  
Four hundred dollars bus a room in the city  
With a whole lot of people and a hole in the ceiling  
Freeze in the winter, die in the summer  
Seventeen kids next door without a mother  
Hey, if you see me coming up the stairs  
Please don't confuse me with someone who cares  
  
Welcome to the city, I'm glad you made it, baby  
I'm really  
  
You got some letter, it's a recommendation  
Your best friend's ex sent a copy to the station  
And he knows some agent through a distant relation  
An inside connection with a map and directions  
Ah, too bad you came  
Too bad you waited  
Too bad for you  
You're over-educated  
  
Welcome to the city, I'm glad you made it, baby  
I'm really glad  
  
Don't ask for love  
Don't ask for pity  
Don't ask for me  
Welcome to the city
