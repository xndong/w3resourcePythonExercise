Deep down in my heart  
There is a lot of words  
Tears fall down my face  
But I hear the many voices that cry in pain  
  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
Don't give it up  
  
Hear the voices, wraps around you  
All the people, never doubt it  
Hear the voices, take a look at what's around you  
All the people, we can change things never doubt it  
  
We won't take new start  
Is it just too much to ask?  
Ooh, what does it take?  
'Cause I hear a million people singing the same  
  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
I want to tell you  
Don't give it up  
Don't give it up  
  
Hear the voices, wraps around you  
All the people, never doubt it  
Hear the voices, take a look at what's around you  
All the people, we can change it  
We can change it  
  
Hear the voices, all the people  
Hear the voices, all the people  
  
Hear the voices, all the people  
All the people  
Hear the voices, all the people  
  
Hear the voices, all the people [Repeat: x5]

[Chorus: x6]  
Baby don't cry  
  
When you're down and confused  
Nothing seems right  
And it's you who decides  
Who's going to make it right  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Well life ain't no joke  
But it's good when you smile  
Steal everything  
But you won't get far  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Sometimes you will fall  
What cha gonna do?  
Give your friend a call  
  
[Chorus: x6]  
  
We know that you can smile  
Even though it takes a while  
To lose your fears and say  
Gonna lose your fears and say  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
  
Do you know who you are  
And where you're going to  
Don't you know that love  
Gonna pull you  
Gonna pull you through now baby  
  
[Chorus: x6]  
  
Baby don't cry, baby don't cry [Repeat: x4]  
  
Face to face  
Anything is possible  
Not political, or analytical  
Never giving up on the wrong  
You got a choice  
Why don't you use it  
Change, is an attitude  
Guaranteed to take hold of you  
So welcome, to the turnstile  
Take a turn with a new vow  
Hey, I know what you know  
All the sympathy  
Made a mess of me  
Respect the sacrifice  
Before the number one  
Now it has begun  
  
[Chorus: x4]

Nicky's in the corner  
With a black coat on  
Running from a bad home  
With some cat inside  
Now where did you find her  
Among the neon lights  
That haunt the streets outside  
Stay with me  
  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
She wants to go home  
  
From door way to door way  
Street corner to corner  
With neon ghosts in the city  
And she sings  
  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
Stay with me  
  
She's so scared  
So very frightened  
Anything could happen  
Right here tonight  
  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
She wants to go home  
  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)  
Beautiful girl  
(stay with me)

Watch the world go go  
Itll spin til it stops  
People gonna fly off  
When they turn it off  
  
Its the way we walk down the road  
Without care for the good news  
As the rain plays games with our feet  
Well I do hope its not too free  
  
Everything's closed and I need a smoke  
A serious habit treat it like a joke  
Listen now let me get this straight  
To be a man you need a fate  
  
You look strange when you're laughing  
Uneasy with your morons smile  
Slow motion see-saw ride  
My minds not on it but you gotta try

Don't you wonder  
Is anyone that strong  
It takes me under  
Believing what I'm seeing  
I get so tired of watching friends go down  
The hungry tiger for all who never began  
  
Biting bullets  
Biting the clouds  
Biting bullets  
Biting the clouds  
  
I saw the show  
Shaking all the babies  
Should I believe the parade of clever lies  
Shadow of light in the shadow of death  
There is no difference to all who never began  
  
There was a time  
There was a way to live  
And it's no secret  
That it won't come back again  
  
I lose myself like anybody else  
But I'm not so strong to make it in the end  
I need some answers when the day comes crashing down  
'Cause it's all over when there's no one to be found

In the mist  
Of my endless search  
The best in life  
Becomes clear  
  
The rest just begins  
To fade by itself  
That's a trick I learned  
Though it took so long  
  
Bitter tears taste so sweet  
I'm seeing my way  
For the first time in years  
When the love around  
Begins to suffer  
And you can't find love  
In one  
In one another  
Push away those bitter tears  
Bitter tears  
  
And I thought I was doing no wrong  
And I thought I was doing no wrong  
  
In the hour  
Of your needs  
Lips are trembling  
Cause your gonna be free  
Realize what were doing here  
The time is right to kill your fears  
  
Bitter tears taste so sweet  
I'm seeing my way  
For the first time in years  
When the love around  
Begins to suffer  
And you can't find love  
In one  
In one another  
Push away those bitter tears  
Bitter tears  
  
An I though I was doing no wrong  
Push away those bitter tears  
That's what they call doing no wrong  
That's what they call doing no wrong  
  
Push away those bitter tears [Repeat: x3]  
  
That's what they call doing no wrong

Could be clear black and white  
Make a decision  
Got a need inside and I don't know why  
It's a strong feeling that grows and grows  
  
One day, my life is out the door  
Next day, you show me what it's for  
One day, I think I know myself  
Next day, you leave me on the shelf  
  
New moment goes like this  
Never forbidden  
There's nothing to stop  
The thief on time, stealing  
The hours that keep you away  
  
It rushes through my veins  
Straight to my head  
My mind is a planet  
For you to roam  
  
This is only just the start  
It's the beginning  
There's nothing to stop  
The thief of time  
Stealing the hours  
That keep you away  
  
One day, my life is out the door  
Next day, you show me what it's for  
One day, I think I know myself  
Next day, you leave me on the shelf  
  
In this house I call home  
Living together  
Got a need inside  
And I don't know why  
It's a strong  
Feeling and it grows and grows  
  
One day, my life is out the door  
Next day, you show me what it's for  
One day, I think I know myself  
Next day, you leave me on the shelf  
  
This is only just the start  
It's the beginning  
  
New moment goes like this  
Never forbidden  
  
Could be clear black and white  
Make a decision

Get your motor runnin'  
Head out on the highway  
Lookin' for adventure  
And whatever comes our way  
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
I like smoke and lightning  
Heavy metal thunder  
Racin' with the wind  
And the feelin' that I'm under  
Yeah Darlin' go make it happen  
Take the world in a love embrace  
Fire all of your guns at once  
And explode into space  
  
Like a true nature's child  
We were born, born to be wild  
We can climb so high  
I never wanna die  
  
Born to be wild  
Born to be wild

And where has innocence gone  
Do we know too much  
Are you comfortable in your skin  
When does the strip begin  
All the words we are fed  
And the need to belong  
Cause we can't get connected  
Baby try  
Where has our innocence gone  
We whisper and touch  
It's like we should start again  
When does the strip begin  
Some are taken some are given  
Building bridges for the living  
Some are taken some are given  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Where has your innocence gone  
Do you just know too much  
Are you comfortable in your skin  
When does the strip begin  
  
Some are taken some are given  
Building bridges for the living  
Some are taken some are given back  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some days I am everything I hate  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some days I am everything I hate  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some days I am everything I hate  
There's nothing if the truth won't survive  
  
Some are taken some are given  
Building bridges for the living  
Some are taken some are given back  
There's nothing if the truth don't survive  
  
And where has innocence gone  
Do you know too much  
Are you comfortable in your skin  
When does the strip begin

It's no use pretending  
That I understand  
The hide and seek we play with facts  
It changes our demand  
  
Tilt my hat at the sun  
And the shadows they burn dark  
Light me and I'll burn for you  
And the love song never stops  
  
I like the look in your eyes  
When you talk that certain way  
I love the day in the life  
When you know that lover's way  
  
Minding my own business  
When you came along  
Temperature's been running hot  
The fever was so strong  
  
Tilt my hat at the sun  
And the shadows they burn dark  
Light me and I'll burn for you  
And the love song never stops  
  
It's always an adventure  
The fantasies we make a fact  
You're the secret I desire  
I can't keep that to myself  
  
When we're not together  
It doesn't feel so bad  
We could be so far apart  
But our love's not sad  
  
It's no use pretending  
'Cause I understand  
The hide and seek we play with facts  
It changes our demand

In the dark of the night  
Those small hours  
Uncertain and anxious  
I need to call you  
  
Rooms full of strangers  
Some call me friend  
But I wish you were so close to me  
  
In the dark of night  
Those small hours  
I drift away  
When I'm with you  
  
In the dark of night  
By my side  
In the dark of night  
By my side, by my side, by my side  
I wish you were  
I wish you were  
  
Here comes the clown  
His face in a wall  
No window  
No air at all  
  
In the dark of night  
Those faces they haunt me  
But I wish you were  
So close to me  
  
By my side  
By my side  
I wish you were  
I wish you were  
By my side  
  
In the dark of night  
Those faces they haunt me  
I wish you were so close to me  
  
Yes I wish you were  
By my side

Well you spent the whole day  
With your axe to the wheel  
Read the late paper  
It was full of bad news  
Excuse me but I think  
What I'm saying is true  
You've got to find some time  
And devote it to you  
So come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
Come on down

Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
  
So come on all you people  
With the stars in your hair  
You know what's going on  
There's no need to despair  
Take the chains from you mind  
Take the chains from your feet  
And do the sex dance  
'cause' it's necessary  
  
You don't have to be rich  
You don't have to be famous  
No you just  
Gotta have  
A little bit of patience  
Jump into your old car  
Or take a cab train or boat  
The only thing that matters  
Is that ya really gotta go  
  
So come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations  
To put it on the line  
Come on down  
To the party  
Callin' all nations

Peace and happiness  
  
We could sit here forever

Another war in the holy land  
  
Shock the world

We're gonna watch them keep it strong

Here come the woman  
With the look in her eye  
Raised on leather  
With flesh on her mind  
  
Words as weapons  
Sharper than knives  
Makes you wonder how the other half die  
How the other half die  
Make you wonder  
  
Here come the man with the look in his eye  
Fed on nothing but full of pride  
Look at them go, look at them kick

Every single one of us  
The devil inside

You might give a little more  
  
Dreams of yours

That shines on the other side  
On the other side  
  
Hey!  
Come on in baby, everybody got's a dream  
  
At the devil's party  
Watch them standing in line

Oh, lonely days  
On the road to excess  
When you're on fire  
You burn like the rest  
  
I might believe it's love  
(Where do we belong)  
And you might believe it's war  
(Where do we belong)  
Why don't we take a little less  
(Where do we belong)  
Then we could give a little more

Looking for an answer

Well you've got to show something

This is all I have  
Would you take it from me?

And in reflection of days gone by  
I stayed awake all last night  
When morning came, I was still unsure  
To laugh or cry, I'm needin' more  
  
And it's not easy to take the time  
From all we need, we cannot hide  
We live our dreams and all we find  
Is bittersweet and full of pride  
  
Ooh what have we done  
Built it up, a little too strong  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do what'cha do what'cha  
  
I need every minute with you  
No one else can do what'cha do what'cha

We're all running fast tonight  
Rocket shoes on our feet  
There's a planet where it's right  
I'm sure we'll get there by next week  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
  
You say don't worry while in flight  
The darkness is like a fog  
I won't get scared  
I won't get tired  
I've been in space so damn long  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
  
The Earth is just a big blue dot  
I see the cars and planes  
There's a planet where it's right  
I'm sure we'll get there by next week  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
I could've been a doctor  
I could've been a lawyer  
I could've been a scientist  
I could've been normal  
Especially in the daylight  
Especially in the daylight

I'm standing here on the ground  
The sky above won't fall down  
See no evil in all direction  
Resolution of happiness  
Things have been dark  
For too long  
  
Don't change for you  
Don't change a thing for me  
  
I found a love I had lost  
It was gone for too long  
Hear no evil in all directions  
Execution of bitterness  
Message received loud and clear  
  
Don't change for you  
Don't change a thing for me  
  
I'm standing here on the ground  
The sky above won't fall down  
See no evil in all directions  
Resolution of happiness  
Things have been dark for too long  
  
Don't change for you  
Don't change a thing for me

Look at all that shines  
Baby's down on the world and she knows it  
If your spirits running  
Why don't we make it rain like we used to  
We run  
We hide  
We wait and we want  
The good life  
Aw sure  
You're right  
This ain't, the good life  
Ah, Elegantly wasted  
Ah, Elegantly wasted  
  
Look at all the crimes  
Baby's down on the world cause she owns it  
Making up her life  
Nothing more nothing less makes it voodoo  
  
We run  
We hide  
We wait and we want  
The good life  
Aw sure  
You're right  
This ain't, the good life  
  
Ah, Elegantly wasted  
Ah, Elegantly wasted  
  
Well look at all that shines  
Baby's down on the world and she knows it  
If your spirits fine  
Why don't we make it rain like we used to  
We run  
We hide  
We want  
The good life  
Aw sure  
You're right  
This ain't, the good life  
  
Ah, Elegantly wasted you could be right,  
You could be certain  
You could be right  
Ah, Elegantly wasted  
Ah, Elegantly wasted you could be right,  
You could be certain  
You could be right  
Ah, Elegantly wasted feels like feels like  
  
Elegantly wasted you could be right,  
Elegantly wasted you could be certain  
Elegantly wasted you could be right  
Feels right, feels right

Yeah we're not the only ones  
Who bleed for the love that's lost  
Trust like the air we breathe  
Live you've got to lose some sleep  
Everything you do for me  
Everything I do for you  
Everything you do for me  
No one else comes close to you  
  
You laugh when the cool gets cold  
Cry when the punch lines told  
Fall into the arms of god  
Pray that your souls not sold  
Change keeps us moving on  
Alone as you walk through the crowd  
Live we're gonna lose some sleep  
Trust like the air we both breathe  
  
Anything I do for you  
Anything you do for me  
  
The way you see the world  
The way you see the world  
The way you see the world  
The way, yeah.  
  
Everything you do for me  
Everything I do for you  
  
The way you see the world  
No one else comes close to you  
  
Ah yeah, ah ha  
Ah yeah, ah ha  
Ah yeah, ah ha  
  
No one else comes close to you  
  
Ah yeah, ah ha

Turns back to front, turns hate to love  
The simple things that mean a lot  
Turns rock to sand, turns ice to snow  
That's you and me about to grow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Change the face of a magazine  
Face the change of a million years  
Stare in shock at what you saw  
Take a breath and lock the door  
Tell your children what to do  
Mistakes and all they still love you  
Change the pace of a magazine  
Face the change of a million years  
  
Turns rough to smooth, turns don't to do  
To reminisce turns me to you  
Turns war to peace, turns greed to need  
The consequence of visionaries  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Turns back to front, turns hate to love  
The simple things that mean a lot  
Turns rock to sand, turns ice to snow  
That's you and me about to grow  
  
[Chorus]

There's this place full of mountain heads  
Living and chewing on the fat  
Built upon the hazy plan  
Like foundations slipping through the sand  
  
Long teeth and whiskers like a rat  
Fearing only those present  
They got zero emotion  
And everybody's fed up with that  
  
Warm outside but very cold within  
Followed and praised for many years  
They got all the promotions  
Isn't that the way it's always been  
  
History's written always red  
It's pages are painful and clear  
It's so full of devotion  
Makes you wonder where it could have led  
  
Put the lights out, fair weather ahead  
These strange new creatures  
Aha, they won't be led

All the people  
In this world  
All the people  
In this world  
  
Gotta tell you  
It's alright  
Look at the cover  
Of a magazine  
The pride of a nation  
They're down on their knees  
I got to tell you  
Let the people speak  
  
[Chorus:]  
I got to tell you  
Yeah you got to have faith  
In each other  
All you ever  
All you ever have for each other  
  
They give us a reason  
To go on living  
It's all in the choices  
That you have to make  
I got to tell you  
You better make them good  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the people  
In this world  
All the people  
In this whole wide world  
I got to tell you  
Let the people speak  
  
[Chorus]

Lyrics:  
Here on terra firma  
The violence is spreading  
The walls are collapsing  
Into your back yards  
Here on terra firma  
The fires are raging  
The riots up staging  
To prove a point to none  
Here on terra firma  
The fear is choking  
The life out of each and every one  
Here on terra firma  
Where TV is King  
Where a black man with the same name  
Had a televised beating  
It's not too late  
Yeah it's never too late  
To heal these wounds  
That are fatal to the end  
To understand our sins  
To make amends  
See 'em down in hell  
Must turn back the tide  
This hatred must be stopped  
Let's throw our arms out wide  
And the dead are breaking in  
When your world comes to an end  
Will you say you did all could  
And then just hang your head  
Why not believe  
In the good of man  
Not bricks and burn  
Take all that you can  
To love your fellow man  
With all of your heart  
As you would yourself  
We must try not to stand above  
And hate you go to hell  
Put love in your heart  
God is not some TV show  
Our life is not some part  
Try to believe  
That only good will come  
If you give not to receive  
That is kingdom come  
Here on terra firma  
The violence is spreading  
Spread to your back yard  
Here in firma terror  
Leads to hatred and unrest  
Not only can we beat it  
No, that would be best

Full moon in a dirty sky  
That's all we can hope for, yeah  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
Don't be surprised  
By the way it is  
I've broken bones for less, yes  
  
I took a voyage (took a voyage)  
On the deep blue sea (deep blue sea)  
But I had to swim away  
I swam away that day  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
I took a voyage  
On the deep blue sea (won't come back)  
  
Innocence is what we want  
Now even children think that way, yeah  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon in a dirty sky  
  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
Full moon over dirty hearts  
  
I took a voyage, yeah  
On the deep blue sea  
  
I took a voyage, yeah  
On the deep blue sea

I just landed  
Girl on fire  
I felt the heat  
From Sydney to London  
  
Well she shut my mouth  
With her repartee  
I opened hers  
With the rest of me  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
  
Outta the shadows  
Comes a dirty song  
Yeah, the same old faces  
Try to keep you in line  
  
I saw you laughing  
At the very first show  
You lit up the city  
From the twenty-sixth floor  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Aw, what's saving her?  
  
Burn, burn, burn  
Burn, burn, burn  
  
I just landed  
Girl on fire  
I felt the heat  
From New York to London  
  
Well she shut my mouth  
With a repartee  
I opened hers  
With the things that I say  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
That's the heat that burns  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
How the flames make you learn  
  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
Baby burn, burn, burn  
Girl on fire (girl on fire)  
How the flames make me yearn  
  
Girl on fire  
Girl on fire  
Girl on fire  
Girl on, girl on  
  
Flame's are rising  
Flames are rising  
Girl, girl, girl, girl girl on fire  
Burning brighter

Romance is gone  
He's drifting with the stars  
A lyric in his pocket  
Little girl in his heart  
When you hears his songs  
On the radio  
I don't need to tell you  
What you already know  
He's on God's top ten  
Where heaven never ends  
  
You saw the world  
And the world saw you on the stage  
Wild, wild, wild colonial boy  
Roquefort le pont  
Your gypsy heart is free  
Pictures on the wall  
Of your family  
He's on God's top ten  
Where heaven never ends  
He's on God's top ten  
  
Baby's got momma's eyes  
She was always beautiful  
When you hear his voice  
Feel his arms around you  
You remember momma smiling  
A daddy's little girl  
Bad weather cold media storm  
He's on God's top ten  
Where heaven never ends  
He's on God's top ten

I'm drunk can't see my glass  
Not worried--chair dancing man  
  
Tossed out of the Golden Playpen  
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure  
  
You see the street ahead  
Just keep walking down it  
Look straight ahead  
  
Night club ice cubes crackin'  
The money's gone  
Don't have a cent  
  
Tossed out of the Golden Playpen  
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure  
  
Sex talks eats you alive  
We go making friends  
Till we're satisfied  
  
I'm drunk can't see my glass  
Not worried, chair dancing man  
  
Tossed out of the Golden Playpen  
Beating the drum of pain and pleasure

You must have heard of all the rules  
Thick and thin teaches you hard  
And all the tricks come back on you  
Leave them behind  
There's a better way  
A better way  
All along you must have known  
Where your life was leading  
The good and bad times  
Where your life was leading  
  
And I know you've been through hell  
Yes I know all about it  
And I've seen your cool white face  
But I can't seem to care about it  
Care about it

Everybody shake  
Everybody groove  
Everybody shake  
  
Mary, Mary, you're on my mind  
The folks are gone and the place'll be mine  
Mary, Mary, wanna be with you  
  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna put a call to you  
'Cause I feel good tonight  
And everything's gonna be right, right, right  
  
I'm gonna have a good time tonight  
Rock and roll music gonna play all night  
Come on, baby, it won't take long  
Only take a minute just to sing my song  
  
Boney Moroney's gonna be with him  
I said, Long Tall Sally's gonna be with Slim  
And Short Fat Fanny's gonna, she's gonna be there too  
  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
Well, I've got to put a call to you  
'Cause I feel good tonight  
And everything's gonna be right, right, right  
  
I'm gonna have a good time tonight  
Rock and roll music gonna play all night  
Come on, baby, it won't take long  
Only take a minute just to sing my song  
  
Boney Moroney's gonna be with Jimmy  
Long Tall Sally's gonna be with him  
And Short Fat Fanny's gonna be there too  
  
And this is what I'm gonna do  
I've got to put the call to you  
'Cause I feel good tonight  
And everything's gonna be right, right, right  
  
I'm gonna have a good time tonight  
Rock and roll music gonna play all night  
Come on, baby, it won't take long  
Only take a minute just to sing my song

So your time has come  
Children watch the fools  
Don't let anyone tell you  
What you must do  
Do you like what you see  
Or does it make you cry  
Use your imagination  
And start a fire  
  
[Chorus:]  
Hear that sound  
There's a voice to be found  
Making changes go round  
Hear that sound  
  
And my selfish ways  
Disappeared one day  
With the realization  
Of a new way  
Images of the free  
Coming into view  
Our hearts full of promises  
Of all we can do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So your time has come  
Children watch the fools  
Don't let anyone tell you  
What you must do  
Do you like what you see  
Or does it make you cry  
Use your imagination  
And start a fire  
  
[Chorus]

Your eyes are like deep wells of desire  
Once in your arms I'm on fire  
You were sent girl so perfectly true  
Changing my life  
Now I'm a survivor  
  
[Chorus:]  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
  
Late at night when the evening fire has died  
There's a look in your eye  
Seductive images fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day you'll see what angels can see  
Dressed in black if she comes back  
I think I'll loose my mind  
  
Tuesday she works  
In the library uptown  
Some useful knowledge  
Can always be found  
Don't burn the library  
Till you've read all the books  
Sometimes in life  
You get a second look  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
Heaven sent  
That's what I call you  
  
Heaven sent [Repeat: x5]

Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song I know  
There's a change of weather coming  
There's a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Freedom is intoxicating  
It's a lizard in your hand  
Don't you worry about the future  
I need some in my plan  
  
Here comes my kamikaze  
Here comes God's top ten  
Nothing to be done to stop it  
Nothing to get in its way

Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song I know  
There's a change of weather comin'  
There's a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Freedom is intoxicatin'  
It's a lizard in your hand  
Don't you worry about the future  
I need some in my plan  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Here comes my kamikaze  
Here comes God's top ten  
Nothin' to be done to stop it  
Nothin' to get in its way  
  
Here comes the rationalization  
Here comes the song we know  
There's a change of weather comin'  
There's a change in me and you  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
I found some questions to the answers  
The dancing flames of romances  
  
Flames of romances  
I found some questions

Keep The Peace  
  
Should you fall into my arms again,  
You know I'll pray with you,  
(You know I'll pray with you...)  
In my room at night, your vision shining bright,  
I'm waiting for you,  
(I'll be waiting for you...)  
  
Dancing in the light,  
Shadows fall from you,  
Learn to watch your step - You come falling  
In my arms again, in my heart again,  
You will break like a butterfly  
  
Keep the peace for what you're talking,  
"Keep the Peace, Keep the Peace"  
Walk of fame is where you're walking,  
"Keep the Peace, Keep the Peace"  
  
Keep a hold of what you're taking,  
Even though the walls are shaking,  
Keep the peace there's still tomorrow,  
"Keep the Peace"  
  
When you break into my arms again,  
You know I'll stay with you,  
(You know I'll stay with you...)  
Now you're holding on, I'll be with you tonight,  
I'll watch over you,  
(Yeah, I'm watching over you...)  
  
On the street inside, see the blinding light,  
Am I dreaming - you come falling,  
In my arms again, in my heart again,  
You will break like a butterfly  
  
Keep the peace, the walls are talking,  
"Keep the Peace, Keep the Peace"  
Walk of fame is where you're walking,  
"Keep the Peace, Keep the Peace"  
"Keep the Peace, Keep the Peace"  
"Keep the Peace"  
Keep a hold of what you're taking,  
Even though the walls are shaking,  
"Keep the Peace, Keep the Peace"

Come on [Repeat: x4]  
  
I look around  
Unsatisfied  
At what they're giving me  
Then I think  
To myself  
Is there someone else  
Who feels the same as me  
Do you feel the same baby  
  
When my back is broken  
When the mountain moves away  
All the dreams and promises  
That we give  
We give away  
  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
  
Look ahead  
But don't mix it up  
Baby look ahead  
To better days  
And better ways  
Make peace  
With flesh and blood  
Make peace  
With your love  
  
Nothing more I could ask of you  
In the end this is the truth  
  
When my back is broken  
When the mountain moves away  
All the dreams and promises  
That we give  
We give away  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked  
  
Sometimes you kick  
Sometimes you get kicked

Put the red lights on  
Don't tell them that you're gone  
Leave behind your fears  
You know they can't be wrong  
Kill the pain you feel  
Kill the pain you feel  
  
I know you've seen some things  
That hurt you in your dreams  
Your face it tells the story  
The pages stained with tears  
  
Kill the pain you feel  
Kill the pain you feel  
Keep the heart  
You feel within  
  
Take the curtains down  
The sun is what you found  
It leads you far from here  
And takes you to high ground  
  
Find a way  
Keep the heart  
You have within

Playing in the dirt  
We find the seeds of doubt  
Don't water them with your tears  
Don't think about all the years  
You'd rather be without  
  
Eden lets me in  
I find the seeds of love  
And climb upon the highwire  
I kiss and tell all my fears  
  
Falling down the mountain  
End up kissing dirt  
Look a little closer  
Sometimes it wouldn't hurt  
  
Playing in the dirt  
We find the seeds of fun  
And we scream like alleycats  
Tearing down what we attack  
To prove that we are one  
  
Cutting through the night  
And we find the seeds of lust  
And lose our minds on one intent  
These passions never seem to end

I'm laying down the law  
Showdown in the north land  
Just the whiff of corruption  
Is the tip of the iceberg  
  
Savor and sweet liberty  
And there's trouble from the south  
Shouting from the gallery  
Now I find I've got to shut it out  
  
I'm searching for a light  
To kill my sense of fear  
To break through darkened nights  
And take me through the years  
  
There's no need to tell you  
What I think has gone wrong  
There's grey clouds of dissension  
Let it show, let it show a silver lining  
  
Sweet blood on the razor  
Is it poetry or politics?  
Forget about the nightmare  
I'll make it a dream that changes everything  
  
I'm searching for a light  
To kill my sense of fear  
To break through darkened nights  
And take me through the years  
  
Sweet blood on the razor  
Is it poetry or politics?  
Forget about the nightmare  
I'll make it a dream that changes everything  
  
I'm searching for a light  
To kill my sense of fear  
To break through darkened nights  
And take me through the years

Sky is blue I'm watching you  
Grass is green what does it mean  
Clouds are white don't loose that fight  
Generations oversight  
Is fucking up my poetry  
Let it ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
  
Caught in between  
The sun and the moon  
and the stars  
  
The sky is blue I'm watching you  
The grass is green what does it mean  
Clouds are white don't loose that fight  
Generations oversight  
Is fucking up my overdrive  
Let it ride, ride, ride  
Ride, ride, ride  
  
Ride, ride, ride  
Let it ride, ride, ride

Lyrics:  
Oh yeah  
Light it up  
There's no love where  
There's no life  
Where it's dark  
And we fuss and fight  
We've gotta lighten up  
We've gotta open up  
Everybody  
Gotta light the world up  
Any man  
Ain't that bad  
Neither is  
Being sad  
We gotta let it out  
Scream and shout  
Letting go is  
What it's all about  
Well it's time to give  
Be positive  
Open up  
Then you can live  
Just check your motive  
Make sure it's positive  
In everything you do  
There must be love  
Gotta light it up  
Light that world  
Oh yeah  
Here's the score  
No more war  
Just lots of love with  
Open doors  
To a higher realm  
Where hate is sensitive  
Remember open up and  
Love one and all  
You know what I'm talkin' about  
Just gotta lighten up

On the talk back show  
On the radio  
At the local bar  
In the hot traffic by the red tail lights  
  
(Chorus)  
Everybody's down on their knees  
Listen like thieves  
But who needs that  
When it's all in your hands  
  
And we take it down  
To the end of town  
Where they have control  
But they're losing touch when the lights go out  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Everybody's down on their knees  
Listen like thieves for the end signs  
But who needs that when you've got it all in your hands  
It's all in your hands  
It's all in your hands  
  
You are all you need  
You are all you need  
And that is everything  
So don't hesitate  
There's no time to waste  
You just do it for yourself  
  
(Chorus)  
  
You got it all  
You got it all  
It's all in your hands  
You got it all  
Got it all

This is ?  
Food of love  
That they said  
Got it wrong  
Smiling  
You and I  
Thinking  
Never see it die  
  
What I say now  
What I say now  
I don't think we know each other  
Enough to lie  
Enough is enough anyway  
  
These changes  
Lives alone  
Drowning  
By the fire  
Out of dearth  
He becomes  
Man without  
Qualities  
  
What I say now  
What I say now  
I don't think we know each other  
Enough to lie  
Enough is enough anyway  
  
This love  
Food of love  
They said  
Got it wrong  
Smiling  
You and I  
Thinking  
Never see it die  
  
What I say now  
What I say now  
I don't think we know each other  
Enough to lie  
Enough is enough anyway  
  
You and I  
What I say

Hallucinate  
Desegregate  
Mediate  
Alleviate  
Try not to hate  
  
Love your mate  
Don't suffocate on your own hate  
Designate your love as fate  
A one world state  
As human freight  
The number eight  
A white black state  
A gentle trait  
The broken crate  
A heavy weight  
Or just too late  
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate  
Now devastate  
Appreciate  
Depreciate  
Fabricate  
Emulate  
The truth dilate  
Special date  
The animal we ate  
Guilt debate  
The edge serrate  
A better rate  
The youth irate  
Deliberate  
  
Fascinate  
Deviate  
Reinstate  
Liberate  
To moderate  
Recreate  
Or detonate  
Annihiliate  
Atomic fate  
  
Mediate  
Clear the state  
Activate  
Now radiate  
A perfect state  
Food on plate  
Gravitate  
The Earth's own weight  
Designate your love as fate  
At ninety-eight we all rotate  
  
Hallucinate  
Desegregate  
Mediate  
Alleviate  
Try not to hate  
  
Love your mate  
Don't suffocate on your own hate  
Designate your love as fate  
A one world state  
As human freight  
The number eight  
A white black state  
A gentle trait  
The broken crate  
  
A heavy weight  
Or just too late  
Like pretty Kate has sex ornate  
  
Now devastate  
Appreciate  
Depreciate  
Fabricate  
Emulate  
The truth dilate  
Special date  
The animals we ate  
Guilt debate  
The edge serrate  
A better rate  
The youth irate  
Deliberate  
Fascinate  
Deviate  
Reinstate  
  
Liberate [Repeat: x4]

Hey, shake it, shake it, shake it  
There's a monkey on my back  
Been there much too long  
Every time I kick it off  
Another one comes along  
  
I used to be in another world  
I used to be alone  
It's so hard to be yourself  
When you feel like something's wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
There are no words that could explain  
You gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
There are no words that could explain  
You gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
  
She said "I've had enough of your lies  
Can't wait for anyone  
The beginning of the end  
Don't you know that's all wrong  
When you said nothing changes  
you meant to say it won't take long"  
  
I used to be in another world  
I used to be alone  
It's so hard to be yourself  
When you feel like something's wrong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Move it  
  
Move on  
  
There's a question in my head  
Been there all night long  
Well I toss and turn inside my head  
But I won't let it tear me down  
  
Yeah, used to be in another world  
I used to be alone, yeah  
  
There are no words that could explain  
The strongest love in vain  
Oh you gotta move on  
There are no words that could explain  
You gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
There are no words that could explain  
Oh you gotta move on  
The strongest love in vain  
  
Had enough, oh, gotta move on, yeah  
There are no words that could explain  
The strongest love in vain

All veils and misty  
Streets of blue  
Almond looks  
That chill divine  
Some silken moment  
Goes on forever  
And we're leaving broken hearts behind  
  
[Chorus:]  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
  
I need perfection  
Some twisted selection  
That tangles me  
To keep me alive  
  
In all that exists  
None have your beauty  
I see your face  
I will survive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Eternally wild with the power  
To make every moment come alive  
All those stars that shine upon you  
Will kiss you every night  
  
All veils and misty  
Streets of blue  
Almond looks  
That chill divine  
Some silken moment  
Goes on forever  
And we're leaving  
Yeah we're leaving broken hearts behind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're eternally wild with the power  
To make every moment come alive  
All those stars that shine upon you  
And they'll kiss you every night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mystify  
Mystify me  
Mystify

Don't ask me  
What you know is true  
Don't have to tell you  
I love your precious heart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
We could live  
For a thousand years  
But if I hurt you  
I'd make wine from your tears  
  
I told you  
That we could fly  
'Cause we all have wings  
But some of us don't know why  
  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never ever tear us apart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
You were standing  
I was there  
Two worlds collided  
And they could never tear us apart  
  
I  
I was standing  
You were there  
Two worlds collided

Live baby live  
Now that the day is over  
I gotta new sensation  
In perfect moments  
Impossible to refuse  
  
Sleep baby sleep  
Now that the night is over  
And the sun comes  
Like a god into our room  
All perfect light and promises  
  
Gotta hold on you  
A new sensation, a new sensation  
Right now gonna take you over  
A new sensation, a new sensation  
  
Dream baby dream  
Of all that's come and going  
And you will find out in the end  
There really is,  
There really is no difference  
  
Cry baby cry  
When you got to get it out  
I'll be your shoulder  
You can tell me all  
Don't keep it in ya  
  
Well that's the reason why I'm here  
Hey hey  
Are you ready for a new sensation, new sensation  
Right now  
Gonna take you on a new sensation, new sensation  
  
Hate baby hate  
When there's nothing left for you  
You're only human what can you do  
It'll soon be over  
Don't let your pain take over you  
  
Love baby love  
It's written all over your face  
There's nothing better we could do  
Than live forever  
Well that's all we've got to do  
Hey now I'm gonna take a new sensation, new sensation  
Right now  
Gotta hold on you  
A new sensation, new sensation  
A new sensation, a new sensation  
A new sensation

Venetian blinds are crackling  
I like the noise  
It's got texture  
Hit it again when I'm mad  
Close it again when I'm sad  
With the door closed I'm a king  
No questions  
No answers  
Don't like talking without reason  
What's the use if you stop feeling  
  
All alone I'm cynical to the TV  
Newsman's making passes to newslady  
Camera stops  
Newsreel babies  
  
I like to close all the doors  
Make it dark  
Make it cool  
Come in and talk  
Whatever you like  
I don't mind if it's something new

Shake make it forever  
Curling from you lips  
Faith and it's not over  
Bring on that famous word  
  
Love don't abuse it  
And you'll never be sad again  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
  
Blood's getting hotter  
Thinking about your hips  
I feel all the hunger  
The minute you turn away  
  
I think it's getting better  
But I can't wait another day  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
  
Make all your wishes  
No sooner said than done  
Here I come like I told you  
Whether it's air, land or sea  
  
She said this is the real thing  
'Cause your never gonna find the door  
  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
  
Love don't abuse it  
And you'll never be sad again  
  
I'm on my way  
[repeat till end]

You might know of the original sin  
And you might know how to play with fire  
But did you know of the murder committed  
In the name of love you thought what a pity  
  
Dream on white boy  
Dream on black girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
To find your dreams are washed away  
  
There was a time when I did not care  
And there was a time when the facts did stand  
There is a dream and held by me  
Well I'm sure you had to see it's up in arms  
  
Dream on white boy  
Dream on black girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
To find your dreams have washed away  
  
You might know of the original sin  
And you might know how to play with fire  
But did you know of the murder committed  
In the name of love you thought what a pity  
  
Dream on white boy  
Dream on black girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
Dream on black boy  
Dream on white girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
Dream on black boy  
Dream on white girl  
Then wake up to a brand new day  
To find your dreams are washed away  
  
Dream on, to play with fire  
White boy, black girl  
Dream on, in the name of love  
Black boy, white girl  
White boy, black girl  
Black boy, white girl  
  
Dream on  
The name of love, yeah  
You thought what a pity  
  
Original sin

I've come to tell you 'bout the story I see  
It made of honey but it sting like a bee  
Got the message that it come from the floor  
And that's the way to get yourself in trouble  
  
You think it's easy 'cause you don't know the feeling  
Make it up  
Make it up like you do no wrong  
Give me fever like a man blind from passion  
If you got the time I'll show you how to turn it on  
  
Please  
You got that need  
  
She got her ways to get me down on the floor  
And take me places that I never seen before  
Someone told me I got to take it easy  
But I'm a junkie  
A junkie when the heat is on

Fallin' asleep at the wheel again baby,  
You're driftin' over the line.  
You're hands are tied, but you're losin' grip quickly  
Fix me, can you read the sign!  
  
Thumbin' your way to Vegas, dirty  
Dreamin' of the other side!  
Save your tears and laughter because  
It doesn't matter what you find  
  
It ain't pretty  
After the show  
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go.  
  
So, if you think you need it,  
Here's the place to feed it  
It ain't pretty.  
  
When, everything that you do is wrong,  
And you  
Feel like you can barely survive  
When those around you  
Are crumblin' downwards  
Buried in the sunset of life.  
  
Thumbin' your way to Vegas, dirty  
And screamin' like a bitch from hell,  
  
Save your dreams  
Up your patience  
Doesn't matter what you sell  
  
It ain't pretty  
After the show  
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go!  
  
So, if you think you want it!  
Here's the place to get it,  
It ain't pretty  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
It ain't pretty  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Thumbin' your way to Vegas, dirty  
Dreamin' like you're out of control,  
Save your tears and laughter  
Because this is the ride  
And this is the show  
  
It ain't pretty  
After the show!  
It ain't pretty when the pretty leaves you  
With no place to go  
  
So, if you think you want it  
Just come in and get it  
  
It ain't pretty

How do you know when it's time for you to go  
How can you stop when you don't know how to start  
How can you go back when you don't know why you're here  
How can you see when your eyes begin to fade  
How will you hear when you've heard it all before  
How do you do all the things you want to do  
  
How much can you take when you've taken all you can  
Hoe can you act when you've never seen the script  
How can you choose when you don't know which is right  
How far can you go if you've been there before  
How can you shine if you've never seen the sun  
How does a child become a man without a child  
How can you heal someone that doesn't want to heal

Sugar, I want to know you, know you inside out  
Mystery surrounds you, got to figure it out  
Driving downtown to your house,  
your lights are never on  
You got me hooked, I wanna drown  
Without your hand I'm going down  
  
And I can't stop, don't help me out, so lonely and I'm bleeding from the
inside  
Oh no no, no no  
I need you, you need to remember, remember, remember who's your man  
  
Met you on the corner not so long ago  
You asked me where I was going,  
I said I don't know  
Tell me how is it you came into  
my life so damn fast  
You blew my mind, left me behind and now I'm living in your past  
  
And I can't stop, blow me out, I'm so lonely, got me bleeding from the inside  
I need you, and you need to remember,  
remember, can't you remember who's your man?  
  
Who's your man?  
  
You knocked me out, so lonely,  
got me bleeding from the inside  
'Cause I need you, and you need to remember  
I said, 'cause I need you,  
and you need to remember  
Can you do that? 'Cause I'm so high  
Remember, can't you remember,  
oh baby, remember who's your man  
  
Who's your man? Who's your man? Who's your man?

One chain to the mountain  
Two feet in the chain  
Three fires approaching  
Four hours away  
  
A sol invictus the invicible sun  
The night is almost come  
  
Five times the assassin  
Six species destroyed  
Seven valleys are numbered  
Eight years till they're gone  
  
Just when I thought  
I'd die on this rock  
I see a face I know  
  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power to change  
You're such an easy prey  
  
Nine times the protector  
Ten years and a day  
Eleventh hour we're facing  
Twelve o'clock in the sun  
  
Oh mother nature  
We're trying to kill you  
Such greedy fools  
  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
You've got the power to change  
  
You're such an easy prey  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power to change  
You're such an easy prey  
  
Thirteen grand designs  
Fourteen you're walking the wire  
Fifteen is when you're lonely  
Sixteen is a long way there  
Seventeen is a whisper  
Eighteen is a whirl  
Nineteen is a mother  
Twenty minutes ago  
  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
Wild wild flower of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power of love  
Salvation Jane  
You've got the power to change  
You're such an easy prey  
Salvation

And we all just need the same things  
I tell you what I know  
We're heading in the same direction  
So never let it go  
  
There are few of us  
Who will never know  
We're counting on every day  
  
I'm not sure about  
You're not sure about  
Why things are going this way  
  
Believe it  
You can see it  
  
I will turn around  
Try to understand  
All of the feelings unsaid  
  
If you're serious love is dangerous  
It changes my world every day

I am searching  
I am not alone  
I am searching  
Please give me some  
  
Have we lost direction  
Washed our hands of blood  
I'm in need of sensation  
Is there more to this love  
Saw a mother screaming  
She had lost control  
Of what she once believed in  
And she was not alone  
Oh yeah  
If you could face the pain  
And I could do the same  
It would be clear tomorrow  
But will it start  
But will it start again  
  
I am searching  
I am not alone  
I am searching  
Please show me some  
  
Saw a mother screaming

I'd love to take this lying down  
But the world we know has lost it's crown  
All night talk an' jazz cigarettes  
Is never gonna change this killer town  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To carry on  
  
Round the corner comes salvation  
Made to order is what you found  
Why oh why do we fool ourselves  
Is it just the need to carry on  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To carry on  
  
Shake the tree you find  
Shake don't cut it down  
  
Glamour takes it's toll on you  
Throw away what's out of view  
Pearls of wisdom hang around your neck  
They warm to the touch of your perfect skin  
  
High, high, high  
High, high, high  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To carry on  
  
Shake the tree you find  
Shake don't cut it down  
  
Shake the tree you find (I see her walking in perfect time)  
Shake don't cut it down (she gives me reason)  
  
To carry on  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time  
She gives me reason  
To never say die  
  
I see her walking  
In perfect time (shake)  
She gives me reason (the tree you find)  
To never say die

Those pretty feet are stuck deep in the ground  
And all that junk keeps coming  
Must be the time to rearrange it all  
Another place another time has called  
She is rising above this world  
She is heading for an open door  
She is rising above this world  
She is heading for an open door  
  
Give it up let her in  
All she wants, is to begin  
Give it up let her in  
All she wants is to begin  
  
One day he wakes up to a different drum  
Rhythm coming from so far away  
He had no time to tell anyone  
His hips were moving to a perfect sway  
  
He is rising above this world  
He is heading for an open door  
He is rising above this world  
He is heading for an open door  
  
Give it up let him in  
All he wants is to begin

Give it up let him in (she is rising, he is rising)  
All he wants is to begin (all he wants is to begin)  
  
She is rising  
He is rising  
All I want all I want is to begin  
He is rising  
She is rising  
  
Give it up  
  
We are rising  
  
She is rising

Making up my life  
Killer in the night  
Rattling my brains  
Looking for that light  
Shine, shine  
Ah shine so bright, shine  
  
When she does that thing  
I want to breathe her in  
Throw away my world  
If I could see that pearl  
  
Shine, shine, shine, shine  
Shine, shine, shine, shine  
  
The skin is deep  
But you're oh so weak  
Don't put your faith  
In the words they speak  
  
The skin is deep  
But you're so so weak  
Don't put your faith  
In the words they speak  
  
Gimme gimme reasons for the things I do  
Silhouette I'm seeing in the shape of you

Bright ideas and a fast hill too

I found you wanting  
Like everyone  
Always trying  
Happy lying  
'cause I'm no stranger  
To the ways of the world  
I felt like crying  
I felt like dying  
We took a coffee  
You took it so strong  
Shaded from the neon  
I could still see your eyes  
  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
  
Found in the gutter  
With a knife in her back  
Letter said sorry  
Please don't worry  
  
She had a lover  
With danger in his eyes  
I tried to tell her  
But she had the wildest heart  
  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh cherry  
Oh cherry baby  
Oh Cherry  
  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how  
Show me, show me  
Show me how

Promises are carved out of lust  
With a fire in the heart  
That burns with no regret  
I vow to play the part  
  
In this a meeting of the soul  
My feelings are unknown  
I learn with no regret  
I'm getting what I get  
  
Feel some pain though I'm miles away  
And ring to let you know  
Are you seeing someone  
I'd better let you go  
  
She said this was a lesson in love  
She said this was a love to end all loves  
This soul never listens to me  
This soul has a lot to learn  
  
Honesty eludes one and all  
Like some gypsy's search for gold  
He's dreaming all the time  
But the gold is hard to find  
  
Made a mistake with myself  
My lover couldn't lie  
She told me of the things  
That made her cry inside  
  
Having the dreams of some gypsy  
More Inxs Lyrics

Have you noticed to this day  
How many times we've prayed and played  
Lifting lovers up and down  
It gets around in this old town  
  
Sleight of hand and sleight of mouth  
A dirty trick to catch me out  
I don't mind but what I say  
Use that magic for better days  
  
Standing above this moment  
Listening to all I say  
The spy of love will track me  
Will catch me  
  
Through the window I see a face  
That dirty face that speaks with sorrow  
You listen to the walls for clues  
Stand in shadows protecting you

My strange desire  
Is waiting here  
To be my light  
My shadow my storm  
This is all and  
This is you  
Turning into  
Another dream  
Please don't be  
Another dream  
  
Do you really think you're cared for  
Do we really know we're loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
This is all and this is you  
  
Do you really think you're cared for  
Do we really know we're loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
Meet again touch again  
Must have wanted  
Some paradise  
Long ago  
That's unwise so unwise  
Look again I said  
Touch again  
Believe your fate  
That's alright that's alright  
  
Do you really think you're cared for  
Do we really know we're loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
Do you really think you're cared for  
Do we really know we're loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above  
  
Do you really think you're cared for  
Do we really know we're loved  
Look at all my resolutions  
Promises to break your heart  
Why do we make it hot to handle  
Why do we lose our self control  
Strange desire take me over  
Offer me to the all above

Don't you know what you're doing  
You've got a death wish  
  
Suicide blonde [Repeat: x4]  
  
Suicide blonde was the color of her hair  
Like a cheap distraction for a new affair  
She knew it would finish before it began  
Wow baby I think you lost the plan  
  
You want to make her suicide blonde  
Love devastation, suicide blonde  
You want to make her suicide blonde  
Love devastation, suicide blonde  
  
She stripped to the beat but her clothes stay on  
White light everywhere but you can't see a thing  
Such a squeeze  
A mad sad moment  
Glory to you  
Glory to you  
Take me there  
Take me there  
  
Got some revelation  
Put into your hands  
Save you from your misery like rain across the land  
Don't you see the color of deception  
Turning your world around again  
  
That's the story.

Yes it's me  
I am the one  
To make you see  
Where we belong  
I was shaking  
Like a leaf  
All wrapped up  
In my dirty sheets  
If I agree to what comes next  
I would be faking  
With the best of them  
It seems a crime  
I would commit  
Without the difference  
Of all the world's gifts  
  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Could you taste it  
  
Never never never  
Never never never (taste it)  
To dream  
All the time  
Without a scream  
In the dead of night  
All those faces  
Come back to me  
I'll be begging  
To swim that sea  
Yea I made  
A picture story  
Make you cry  
In all your glory  
A need to quench  
The thirst of many  
To justify  
And make ready  
  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Could you taste it  
  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
  
This realization  
Owes us strength to show  
If you're uncertain  
You're invited to believe  
These are the words I speak  
These are the words I speak  
  
A dislocation  
From where we once came from  
Give sons and daughters  
Because we want to go on  
  
These are the words she speaks  
These are the words she speaks  
  
Sweet sweet sweet  
Could you taste it  
  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
Never never never (taste it)  
  
Never never never  
Never never never

Oh so fine  
We were trying  
Out of nowhere  
Just in time  
Let you take me  
Deep down the river  
Kiss the changes  
That shape my life  
Always  
Left behind  
All the tracks that  
I could find  
Do do do do do  
All these scars are mine  
  
I was thinking got the feeling  
The gift you gave  
Is gonna last forever  
  
All the lies you find  
All the truth you see  
Rise and fall  
But I know what's mine  
  
Here we lie  
Looking up to  
Empty sky  
And the promises we find  
I'm not the first one  
To ask why  
  
I was thinking  
Got the feeling  
The gift you gave  
Is gonna last forever

Yonder she's walking  
She comes my way  
Her red dress on  
Her long black hair  
  
Walking like  
Talking like  
Wanting like  
She comes to me  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I can't go on  
  
Helpless baby  
Evil child  
I've known you well  
And if you want to stay  
That's alright  
That's alright  
  
And now she's gone  
She's walking away  
Her red dress on  
Her long black hair  
  
Well I love her so  
And now she'll come running  
Anytime I say now  
Anytime I say  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back  
I can't go on  
  
Oh baby I love you so  
I need you now  
I want you back

Oh baby I love you so

I want you back  
I can't go on

I am a passenger  
And I ride and I ride  
Ride through the city's back sides  
See stars come out of the sky  
Yeah the bright and hollow sky  
You know it looks so good tonight  
I am a passenger  
I stay under glass  
I look through my window so bright  
See the stars come out tonight  
I see the bright and hollow sky  
Over the city's red back side  
And everything looks good tonight  
  
Sing it  
La la la la la la

Get into the car  
We'll be the passengers  
We'll ride through the city at night  
See the city's red back side  
See the bright and hollow sky  
See the stars that shine so bright  
The stars made for us tonight  
  
Oh the passenger  
How how he rides  
Oh the passenger  
He rides and he rides  
Looks through his window  
What does he see?  
Sees the bright and hollow sky  
Sees the stars come out tonight  
Sees the city's red back side  
Sees the winding ocean drive  
And everything was made for you and me  
All of it was made for you and me  
It just belongs to you and me  
So let's take a ride  
See what's mine  
  
Sing it

In a room above a busy street  
The echoes of a life  
The fragments and the accidents  
Separated by incidents  
  
Listen to by the walls  
We share the same spaces  
Repeated in the corridors  
Performing the same movements  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Story to story  
Building to building  
Street to street  
We pass each other on the stairs  
  
Listen to by the walls  
We share the same spaces  
Repeated in the corridors  
Performing the same movements  
  
The nature of your tragedy  
Is chained around your neck  
Do you lead or are you lead  
Are you sure that you don't care  
  
There are reasons here to give your life  
And follow in your way  
The passion lives to keep your faith  
Though all are different, all are great  
  
Climbing as we fall  
We dare to hold on to our fate  
And steal away our destiny  
To catch ourselves  
With quiet grace  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen to by the walls  
We share the same spaces  
Repeated in the corridors  
Performing the same movements  
  
[Chorus]

Welcome to the strangest party baby

Hoping that your gonna come, yeah

It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
It marks the moments as the years go by in an innocent phase  
The swing into never-never land  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
Into my destiny  
Into my desire  
  
It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
So look behind you when the race has run  
And the winner is named  
The swing into never-never land  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
  
Well it's the swing  
The swing like a pendulum  
Between the pieces and between the lines  
Leaving nothing to hide  
There was a darkness like an old friend  
That scratched and crawled up the wall  
Into my life  
Into my destiny  
Into my desire  
  
It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
It's the swing  
It's the swing like a pendulum  
It's the swing

Hold tight  
Nothing missing  
Look around  
Pupils listen  
Can you listen?  
  
Or is it that  
You've learnt too much  
What's your limit  
You know you've heard  
Teeth are clenched  
  
A pack of lies, yeah  
Chords in the neck are tense  
So hold tight  
Sometimes it seems to make no sense  
And don't you cry  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Hold tight  
Yeah, I can see ya  
You got it all under your skin  
Turn around where you stand  
Everybody takes aim at adversity  
  
You know you've heard  
Teeth are clenched  
A pack of lies, yeah  
Chords in the neck are tense  
  
So hold tight  
Sometimes it seems to make no sense

Pay for the crime  
Put you up in cages  
Treat you unkind  
  
All your plans are made now  
Just like they told you  
So what becomes of Monday  
Now that Sunday's gone  
All you ever wanted  
Will come to you one day  
Just when you taste it  
You turn and walk away

Ever stop to wonder  
Should I question  
Move a stone look under  
Should I judge  
  
How you have changed my friend  
You're not the same my friend  
Do you lose sleep at night  
Do you ever stop to think  
Where it went wrong for you  
Who turned your reds to blue  
  
[Chorus:]  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
  
Ever stop to wonder  
I should not question  
Move a stone look under  
I should not judge  
  
They say you're never lonely  
They say you're with the best  
But when they turn those lights out  
I bet you spin and turn  
And cry just like the rest  
And cry just like a baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ever stop to wonder  
I should not question  
Move a stone look under  
I should not judge  
  
No need for desperation  
No need for sweet revenge  
Please try to remember  
The door is always there  
Don't you walk on by  
The door is always there  
  
All you want to do is kick it in  
All you got to do is walk right in  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Who put those tiny daggers in your heart  
Oh yeah  
In your heart  
Yeah

The world is always changing  
You can see it everyday  
But in a tragic situation  
You just can't hide yourself away  
So try a little kindness  
Cause it shouldn't be that hard  
You're shining in the darkness  
When you open up your heart  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Don't leave it to me, nothing's for free  
It comes down to us  
  
Hungry babies on television  
Can you feel the shame  
You've gotta keep on giving to one another  
Cos it's all gonna happen again  
Why don't you try a little kindness  
Cause it shouldn't be that hard  
Just think about what binds us  
And find a new place to start  
  
Your love is all, we need  
To bring us together  
Don't you leave it to me  
Nothing's for free  
It comes down to us  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
We're not indestructible  
Some kind of miracle  
Happens every day  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
Don't leave it to me  
Nothings for free  
  
Your love is all we need  
To bring us together  
We're not indestructible  
Some kind of miracle  
Happens every day  
Oh it comes down to us  
It comes down to us  
We all have to stop, stop,  
Stop pretending now  
It comes down to us

If this was easy  
Where would I be  
I haven't said I have all the answers  
How could anyone  
  
Can't stop looking at the lights  
All around my head  
I'm missing the darker side  
Of the man  
  
He's on his knees  
Looking for the door  
But everybody's  
Giving him applause  
  
Crashed the car  
Into a wall  
But everybody's  
Calling for more  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
These days are numbered  
Counted out in loss  
Faith and spirit  
Walking hand in hand  
  
To meet a wall  
Made of sound  
But where does that sound  
Find a place today  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
Oh shadow take me  
Leave nothing still  
'cause I've not seen the miracle  
How could anyone  
  
We ask too much of the song  
To come and save our souls  
When all it's trying to do now  
Is save its own  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
  
Maybe we came to the wrong show  
I've seen this before  
It's called the end of rock and roll  
  
It's called the end of rock and roll

There are times when I feel like nothing's been achieved  
Torn by indecision, it's not hard to believe it  
That all of our hopes and all of our dreams  
Wrapped up in chains just waiting to be free  
I got to tell you all about it  
  
Man killing man and words are afar  
So many dreams and I'm dark  
Close all the windows and lock all the doors  
Deceiving your friends and using us all  
I got to tell you, doo, doo, doo, yeah  
  
There are times when I feel like nothing's been achieved  
Torn by indecision, it's not hard to believe it  
That all of our hopes and all of our dreams  
Wrapped up in chains just waiting to be free  
I got to tell you, doo, doo, doo  
All you do, doo, doo  
Wouldn't that be friends [?]  
I love you like I do  
I try to tell you, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, loo, loo

I walk this mile  
Like anyone  
What could be found  
In this sweet damaged smile  
Weh heh heh  
We are lost, we are found  
We are thrown together  
  
Weh heh heh  
Would you take my hand

What could be found  
In this sweet damaged smile  
  
The cage is found  
Fools gold inside  
Is there a key to the  
Bars of the mind  
  
Ahhh  
We are lost, we are found  
We are thrown together  
  
Ah hah hah  
Would you take my hand  
  
You look for love  
You just get skin  
You turn around  
And the changes begin  
  
We are lost, we are found  
We are thrown together  
  
Ah hah hah  
Won't you take my hand  
  
Takes a second for your world to change  
Satisfactions what you give away  
Sucks you in and spits you out again  
Picks you up and drives you down again  
  
Takes a second for the world to change  
Sucks you in and spits you out again  
Throws you down and picks you up again

I've come a long way by car  
The road went narrow  
The bridges too far  
Screaming at 90  
Whisper at 10  
Feel the towns make you spend  
  
Another city phone rings  
Letting tears come through  
Mixed among feelings  
Fed on your body  
Fed on your mind  
Words that always remind  
  
Closed eyes and no more breathing  
A trick I had played  
To scare the living  
She laughs at my game  
Questions if I'm sane  
And all we can do is grin  
  
Look see the story  
What would you do  
All the facts before me  
What would you do

Yes it's dark sometimes  
When the people are shoving  
Pushing you into the ground  
And you cry in the daylight  
With the sun in your eyes  
Even though you know your not alone  
  
And it's all been felt before  
You stare out through your window  
And wonder if there's gonna be more  
  
It brings you down  
It's like a war  
Who pays the price  
If you want more  
  
Quiet desperation of a million lives  
Gonna make you change your ways  
We got everything we wanted  
But forgot how we got it  
Just can't paint it golden anyway  
And the strength of all you're giving  
Is gonna make the changes  
Tomorrow's gonna bring a new day  
  
It brings you down  
It's like a war  
Who pays the price  
If you want more  
  
As the years go by  
Will it show on your face  
Or stay hidden behind some door  
Yeah you made your resolutions  
With the will of a priest  
But your not so sure anymore  
  
And the reasons why you're living  
Keep changing  
Every time you find a key you find more  
  
[Repeats]  
It brings you down  
It's like a war  
Who pays the price  
If you want more

Take one step  
Out the door  
Look around  
For a whole lot more  
  
Off in the distance  
Fire burn bright  
We make decisions  
That's what we do  
That's what we do  
  
Wild life  
Wild life  
When it's bad it ain't bad enough  
  
I'll be your one  
Your one and only  
Like animals  
Locked in the zoo  
  
Give me freedom  
Day and night  
No one to tell me  
What to do  
  
Off in the distance  
Fire burn bright  
We make decisions  
  
Wild life  
Wild life  
When it's bad it ain't bad enough  
  
I got to learn  
Some respect  
That's what I have  
I have for you  
  
Motivation  
It comes and goes  
But the questions  
They stay alive  
  
Wild life  
Wild life  
When it's bad it ain't bad enough

If you ever want to taste it  
Go down to the wishing well  
Poison in the well won't make it  
Keep yourself as strong as can be  
  
All men I'll take you  
Take you down and tell you why  
I said woman gonna take you  
Take you down a well that's wide  
  
Take it to the river  
Take it to the world  
I say loving heart  
Gonna show the way  
  
All men  
What ya seeing  
Living it all for the life  
Say all men  
What ya seeing  
Gonna change your ways  
Gonna change your ways  
Gonna change your mind  
  
If you're ever gonna taste it  
Never look right or left  
Look ahead  
I'm the healer  
You're believing  
  
Gonna carry ya to the end  
Gonna carry ya to the end  
  
I'm a healer  
I'm a healer

I got a place with a view  
You can see the cars  
As they travel down the freeway  
To clubs and bars  
There's a woman downstairs  
With matt-grey hair  
And she smiles when she tells me  
There's no room for me here  
They've got it in the city  
They've got it in the country  
But here in the suburbs  
It's all so wishy-washy  
It's all so wishy-washy  
  
I got another place  
This time with a fireplace  
And a woman can come around  
Write poetry and feel safe  
I said it's good for me now  
But I'm not being fed  
I said it's good for me now  
But I'm not being fed
