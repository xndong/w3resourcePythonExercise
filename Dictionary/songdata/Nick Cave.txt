The sun is high up in the sky and I'm in my car  
Drifting down into the abattoir  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
The air grows heavy. I listen to your breath  
Entwined together in this culture of death  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
Slide on over here, let me give you a squeeze  
To avert this unholy evolutionary trajectory  
Can you hear what I hear, babe?  
Does it make you feel afraid?  
  
Everything's dissolving, babe, according to plan  
The sky is on fire, the dead are heaped across the land  
I went to bed last night and my  
Moral code got jammed  
I woke up this morning with a Frappucino in my hand  
  
I kissed you once. I kissed you again  
My heart it tumbled like the stock exchange  
Do you feel what I feel, dear?  
  
Mass extinction, darling, hypocrisy  
These things are not good for me  
Do you see what I see, dear?  
  
The line the God throws down to you and me  
Makes a pleasing geometry  
Shall we leave this place now, dear?  
Is there someway out of here?  
  
I wake with the sparrows and I hurry off to work  
The need for validation, babe, gone completely  
Berserk  
I wanted to be your Superman but I turned out such a  
Jerk  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
I got the abattoir blues  
Right down to my shoes

Ain't Gonna Rain Anymore  
  
Once there came a storm in the form of a girl  
It blew to pieces my snug little world  
Sometimes I swear I can still hear her howl  
Down through the wreckage and the ruins  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
  
Now the storm has passed over me  
I'm left to drift on a dead calm sea  
And watch her forever through the cracks in the beams  
Nailed across the doorways of the bedrooms of my dreams  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
  
Now I got no one to hold  
Now I am all alone again  
It ain't too hot but it ain't too cold  
And there is no sign of rain  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone  
And I'm  
Here I'm on my own  
  
She ain't coming back no more  
She ain't coming back no more  
She ain't coming back no more  
Say what you will, I don't care  
  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby's gone, yeah  
And it ain't gonna rain anymore  
Now my baby has gone

Hushaby, don' you cry  
Go to sleepy little baby  
  
When you awake you shall have cake  
And all the pretty little horses.  
Blacks and Bays, Dapples and Grays  
Coach, and a six a little horses.  
  
So hushaby, etc.  
  
Way down yonda', down in the medder  
There's a poor little lambie.  
Bees an' the butterflies peckin' out his eyes  
Poor lambie cried fo' his mammy.  
  
But hushaby, etc.

(L. Reed)  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrow's parties  
A hand-me-down dress from who knows where  
To all tomorrow's parties  
  
And where will she go and what shall she do  
When midnight comes around  
She'll turn once more to Sunday's gown  
And cry behind the door  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrow's parties  
Why silks and plumes of yesterday's gowns  
To all tomorrow's parties  
  
And what shall she do with Thursday's rags  
When Monday comes around  
She'll turn once more to Sunday's clown  
And cry behind the door  
  
And what costume shall the poor girl wear  
To all tomorrow's parties  
For Thursday's child is Sunday's clown  
For whom none will go mourning  
  
A blackened shroud, a hand-me-down gown  
Of rags and silks, a costume  
Fit for one who sits and cries  
For all tomorrow's parties

As I sat sadly by her side  
At the window, through the glass  
She stroked a kitten in her lap  
And we watched the world as it fell past  
Softly she spoke these words to me  
With brand new eyes, open wide  
We pressed our faces to the glass  
As I sat sadly by her side  
She said, father, mother, sister, brother  
Uncle, aunt and nephew, niece  
Soldier, sailor, physician, laborer  
Actor, scientist, mechanic, priest  
Earth and moon and sun and stars  
And planets and comets with tails blazin'  
All are there forever fallin'  
Fallin' lovely and amazin'  
Then she smiled and turned to me  
And waited for me to reply  
Her hair was fallin' down her shoulders  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
The kitten she did gently pass  
Over to me and again we pressed  
Our different faces to the glass  
That may be very well, I said  
But watch the one fallin' in the street  
See him gesture to his neighbors  
And see him trampled beneath their feet  
All outward motion connects to nothin'  
For each is concerned with their immediate need  
Witness the man reachin' up from the gutter  
See the other one stumblin' on who can not see  
With tremblin' hand I turned toward her  
And pushed the hair out of her eyes  
The kitten jumped back to her lap  
As I sat sadly by her side  
Then she drew the curtains down  
And said, oh, when will you ever learn?  
That what happens there beyond the glass  
Is simply none of your concern  
God has given you but one heart  
You are not a home for the hearts of your brothers  
And God does not care for your benevolence  
Anymore than he cares for the lack of it in others  
Nor does he care for you to sit  
At windows in judgment of the world He created  
While sorrows pile up around you  
Ugly, useless and over inflated  
At which she turned her head away  
Great tears leapin' from her eyes  
I could not wipe the smile from my face  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  
As I sat sadly by her side  

I stepped into an avalanche  
It covered up my soul  
When I am not this hunchback that you see  
I sleep beneath the golden hill  
You who wish to conquer pain  
You must learn to serve me well  
  
You strike my side by accident  
As you go down to your goal  
This cripple here that you clothe and feed  
Is neither starved nor cold  
He does not ask for your company  
Not at the centre, the centre of the world  
  
I who am on a pedestal  
You did not raise me there  
Your laws do not compel me now  
To kneel grotesque and bare  
For I myself am the pedestal  
For this ugly hump at which you stare  
  
You who wish to conquer pain  
You must learn what makes me kind  
The crumbs of love that you offer me  
Are the crumbs I've left behind  
Your pain is no credential here  
It's just a shadow of my wound  
  
I have begun to ask for you  
I who have no greed  
I have begun to long for you  
I who have no need  
You say you've gone away from me  
But I can feel you when you breathe  
  
Do not dress in those rags for me  
I know you are not poor  
And do not love me quite so fiercely now  
When you know that you are not sure  
It is your turn, my beloved one  
It is your flesh that I wear

Babe I got you bad  
Dreaming blood-wet dreams  
Only madmen have  
Baby I got you bad  
I wish to God I never had  
And it makes me feel so sad,  
O, Baby I got you bad  
Yeah, Babe I got you bad  
  
I long for your kiss,  
For the turn of your mouth  
Your body is a long thing  
Heading South  
And I don't know what I'm talking about  
All of my words have gone mad  
Ah, baby I got you bad  
  
Seasons have gone wrong  
And I lay me down in a bed of snow  
Darling, since you've been gone  
Well my hands, they don't know where to go  
And all of my teeth are bared,  
I got you so much I'm scared  
Ah, baby I got you bad  
  
With the sweep of my hand  
I undid all the plans  
That explode at the moment I kissed you  
On your small hot mouth  
And your caramel limbs  
That are hymns to the glory that is you.  
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad  
Look at me darlin' it's sad sad sad  
Baby I got you bad  
  
Smoke bilowing from the bridges  
And the rivers we swim in are boiling  
My hands are reaching for you everywhere  
But you're not there, or you're recoiling  
And a weary moon dangles from a cloud  
Oh honey, I know it's not allowed  
To say I got you bad.  
  
I got you bad...  
I got you bad...  
I got you bad...  
[Repeat and fade]

We've come to bring you home  
Haven't we, Cassiel?  
  
To cast aside your loss and all of your sadness  
And shuffle off that mortal coil and mortal madness  
For we're here to pick you up and bring you home  
Aren't we, Cassiel?  
  
It's a place where you did not belong  
Where time itself was mad and far too strong  
Where life leapt up laughing and hit you hear on and hurt you  
Didn't it hurt you, Cassiel?  
  
While time outran you and trouble flew toward you  
And you were there to greet it  
Weren't you, foolish Cassiel?  
  
But here we are, we've come to call you home  
And here you'll stay, never more to stray  
Where you can kick off your boots of clay  
Can't you, Cassiel?  
  
For death and you did recklessly collide  
And time ran out of you, and you ran out of time  
Didn't you, Cassiel?  
  
And all the clocks in all the world  
May this once just skip a beat in memory of you  
But then again those damn clocks, they probably won't  
Will they, Cassiel?  
  
One moment you are there  
Then strangely you are gone  
But on behalf of us all here  
We're glad to have you home  
Aren't we, dear Cassiel?

You better run You better run and run and run  
You better run You better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run You better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You stand before your maker  
In a state of shame  
Bacause your robes are covered in mud  
While your kneel at the feet  
Of a woman of the street  
The gutters will run with blood  
They will run with blood!  
You better run, you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run, you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
In the days of madness  
My brother, my sister  
When you're dragged toward the Hell-mouth  
You will beg at the end  
But there ain't gonna be one, friend  
For the grave will spew you out  
It will spew you out!  
You better run, you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run, you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You'll be working in the darkness  
Against your fellow man  
And you'll find you're called to come forth  
So you'll scrub and you'll scrub  
But the trouble is, bud  
The blood it won't wash off  
No, it won't come off!  
You better run, you better run  
You better run to the City of Refuge  
You better run, you better run  
You better run and run and run  
You better run to the City of Refuge

Now that mountains of meaningless words  
And oceans divide us  
And we each have our own set of stars  
To comfort and guide us  
Come into my sleep  
Come into my sleep, oh yeah  
Dry your eyes and do not weep  
Come into my sleep  
  
Swim to me through the deep blue sea  
Upon the scattered stars set sail  
Fly to me through this love-lit night  
From one thousand miles away  
And come into my sleep  
Come into my sleep oh yeah  
As midnight nears and shadows creep  
Come into my sleep  
  
Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair  
For I am sick at heart, my dear  
Bind my dreams up in your tangled hair  
For all the sorrow it will pass, my dear  
  
Take your accusation, your recriminations  
And toss them into the ocean blue  
Leave your regrets and impossible longings  
And scatter them across the sky behind you  
And come into my sleep  
Come into my sleep  
For my soul to comfort and keep  
Come into my sleep  
  
For my soul to comfort and keep - my sleep  
  
Come on,  
Come on,  
Come on,  
[repeat and fade]

As so with that, I thought I'd take a final walk  
The tide of public opinion had started to abate  
The neighbours, bless them, had  
Turned out to be all talk  
I could see their frightened faces  
Peering at me trough the gate  
  
I was looking for an end to this, for some kind of closure  
Time moved so rapidly, I had no hope  
Of keeping track of it  
I thought of my friends who had died of exposure  
And I remembered other ones who  
Had died from the lack of it  
  
And in my best shoes I started falling  
Forward down the street  
I stopped at a church and jostled trough the crowd  
And love followed just behind me  
Panting at my feet  
At the steeple tore the stomach from a lonely little cloud  
  
Inside I sat, seeking the presence of a God  
I searched trough the pictures in a  
Leather-bound book  
I found a woolly lamb dozing in an issue of blood  
And a gilled Jesus shivering on a  
Fisherman's hook  
  
Babe  
It seems so long  
Since you've been gone away  
And I  
Just got to say  
That it grows darker with the day  
  
Back on the street I saw a great big smiling sun  
It was a Good day and an Evil day and  
All was bright and new  
And it seemed to me that most  
Destruction was beeing done  
By those who could not choose  
Between the two  
  
Amateurs, dilettantes, hacks, cowboya, clones  
The streets groan with little Caesars,  
Napoleons and cunts  
With their building blocks and their tiny  
Plastic phones  
Counting on their fingers, with crumbs  
Down their fronts  
  
I passed by your garden, saw you with your flowers  
The Mangolias, Camellias and Azaleas so sweet  
And I stood there invisible in the panicking crowds  
You looked so beautiful in the rising heat  
  
I smell smoke, see little fires bursting on the lawns  
People carry on regardless, listening to their hands  
Great cracks appear in the pavement,  
The earth yawns  
Bored and disgusted, to do us down  
  
Babe  
It seems so long  
Since you've been gone  
And I  
Just got to say  
That it grows darker with the day  
  
These streets are frozen now  
I come and go  
Full of a longing for something I do  
Not know  
My father sits slumped in the  
Deepening snow  
As I search, in and out, above,  
About, below  
  
Babe  
It seems so long  
Since you went away  
And I  
Just got to say  
That it grows darker with the day

Oh-ho-ho-ho Dead Joe  
Welcome to the car smash  
Dead Joe  
Junk sculpture turning back to junk Dead Joe  
  
Oh Joe nooooo! It's Christmas time Joe  
It's Christmas time now for you and all the little  
Bells are hanging 2 x 2 the holly and the nativity  
Oh speak to me Joe speak to me Joe speak to me Joe  
  
Oh-oh-oh-ho  
Dead Joe  
Welcome to the car crash  
You can't tell the boys from the girls anymore  
  
Oh-ho-ho  
Dead Joe, the end.

Onward! And Onward! And Onward I go  
Where no man before could be bothered to go  
Till the soles of my shoes are shot full of holes  
And it's all downhill with a bullet  
This ramblin' and rovin' has taken it's course  
I'm grazing with the dinosaurs and the dear old horses  
And the city streets crack and a great hole forces  
Me down with my soapbox, my pulpit  
The theatre ceiling is silver star spangled  
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle  
  
  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
  
  
There's a man in the theatre with girlish eyes  
Who's holding my childhood to ransom  
On the screen there's a death,  
There's a rustle of cloth  
And a sickly voice calling me handsome  
There's a man in the theatre with sly girlish eyes  
On the screen there's an ape, a gorilla  
There's a groan, there's a cough, there's a rustle of cloth  
And a voice that stinks of death and vanilla  
This is a secret, mauled and mangled  
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle  
  
  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
  
  
The walls in the ceiling are painted in blood  
The lights go down, the red curtains come apart  
The room is full of smoke and dialogue I know by heart  
And the coins in my pocket jingle-jangle  
As the great screen crackled and popped  
And the clock of my boyhood was wound down and stopped  
And my handsome little body oddly propped  
And my trousers ride down to my ankles  
Yes, onward! And upward!  
And I'm off to find love  
Do you love me? If you do, I'm thankful  
  
  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
  
  
This city is an ogre squatting by the river  
It gives life but it takes it away, my youth  
There comes a time when you just cannot deliver  
This is a fact. This is a stone cold truth.  
Do you love me? I love you, handsome.  
But do you love me? Yes, I love you, you are handsome  
Amongst the cogs and the wires, my youth  
Vanilla breath and handsome apes with girlish eyes  
Dreams that roam between truth and untruth  
Memories that become monstrous lies  
So onward! And Onward! And Onward I go!  
Onward! And Upward! And I'm off to find love  
With blue-black bracelets on my wrists and my ankles  
And the coins in my pocket go jingle-jangle  
  
  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
Do you love me?  
...

The light from the window  
Falls on the floor  
And after it breaks  
I cut my feet  
On the little bright pieces  
I glow in the dark  
But only when night falls  
It's falling it's falling  
It falls  
  
  
My head is a night-club  
Club-clubbed to dull drums  
Beating to slow  
To dance or to breathe or to dance  
I insist that you cut in  
I A La Flambe  
I'm drinking i'm drinking  
I'm drunk

Farmer Emmerich went into his barn  
And found a cow suckling a serpent  
And a brown ape clanking a heavy chain  
Said Farmer Emmerich to the ape  
Never ask me to come into this barn again  
So Long  
Farewell  
So Long  
  
Farmer Emmerich caught the serpent  
And the brown ape in a cage  
And took them into his house  
He fed the snake a vat of milk  
And when the ape rattled it's chain  
He tossed the ape a mouse  
So Long  
Goodbye  
Farewell  
  
The villagers found out that Farmer Emmerich  
Was nurturing a serpent  
And descended upon his farm  
All rabid in their blindness  
They dragged the snake outside  
Chopped it open with an axe  
And the ground soaked  
In the milk of human kindness  
So Long  
Farewell  
So Long  
  
But the brown ape escaped  
And was heard to roam the ranges  
Clanking it's heavy chain  
Down in the valley it sang to it's friend  
Whom he may never see again

For you dear, I was born  
For you I was raised up  
For you I've lived and for you I will die  
For you I am dying now  
You were my mad little lover  
In a world where everybody fucks everybody else over  
You who are so far from me  
Far from me  
So far from me  
Way across some cold neurotic sea  
Far from me  
  
I would talk to you of all matter of things  
With a smile you would reply  
Then the sun would leave your pretty face  
And you'd retreat from the front of your eyes  
I keep hearing that you're doing best  
I hope your heart beats happy in your infant breast  
You are so far from me  
Far from me  
Far from me  
  
There is no knowledge but I know it  
There's nothing to learn from that vacant voice  
That sails to me across the line  
From the ridiculous to the sublime  
It's good to hear you're doing so well  
But really can't you find somebody else that you can ring and tell  
Did you ever  
Care for me?  
Were you ever  
There for me?  
So far from me  
  
You told me you'd stick by me  
Through the thick and through the thin  
Those were your very words  
My fair-weather friend  
You were my brave-hearted lover  
At the first taste of trouble went running back to mother  
So far from me  
Far from me  
Suspended in your bleak and fishless sea  
Far from me  
Far from me

Gun wears his alcoholism well  
Finger in Bottle and swingin' it still  
From Bed to Sink and back again  
Clock is crawlin' round the same  
He's bustin' Clock (he hates it's face)  
Just sittin' and talkin' to Heart and ticks  
Talkin' back to Clock in slow and studied kicks  
The fears of Gun are the fears of everyone.  
  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Love! Love!  
  
Gun does the waltz around the room  
Collecting Table and Chairs and Sofa and so on and so on  
Gun wears his best blue suit, now let's take to the sky  
'We'll go dancin' and eatin' it up  
Get a bottle and push it on down'  
And let's just beat it up  
Transistor radio plays an overwhelmingly sad and lonely song  
Saying 'Where she gone? Where she gone? '  
The fears of Gun are the fears of everyone.  
  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Fingers down the throat of love  
Love! Love!

Where is Mona? She's long gone  
Where is Mary? She's taken her along  
But they haven't put their mittens on  
And there's fifteen feet of pure white snow?  
Where is Michael? Where is Mark?  
Where is Mathew, now it's getting dark?  
Where is John? They are all out back  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Would you please put down that telephone?  
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
I waved to my neighbor, my neighbor waved to me  
But my neighbor is my enemy  
I kept waving my arms till I could not see  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is anybody out there please?  
It's too quiet in here and I'm beginning to freeze  
I've got icicles hanging from my knees  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is there anybody here who feels this low?  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Is it any wonder?  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Doctor, doctor, I'm going mad  
This is the worst day I've ever had  
I can't remember ever feeling this bad  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Where's my nurse? I need some healing  
I've been paralyzed by a lack of feeling  
I can't even find anything worth stealing  
Under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Is there anyone else here who doesn't know?  
We're under fifteen feet of pure white snow  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Raise your hands up to the sky  
Is it any wonder?  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Oh my Lord, oh my Lord  
Save yourself, help yourself  
Save yourself, help yourself  
Save yourself, help yourself  
Save yourself, help yourself  

I'd just finished writing "Jubilee Street"  
I laid down on my bed and fell into a deep sleep  
And when I awoke, I believed I'd taken a bride called Mary Stanford  
And I flew into a frenzy searching high and low  
Because in my dream the girl was very young  
  
I said, "Hey little girl, where do you hide?  
You draw lightning from the sky"  
  
All of this and her dark hair  
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
Last night your shadow scampered up the wall, it flied  
It leaped like a black spider between your legs, and cried  
My children  
My children  
They are lost to us  
  
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord  
All of this and her dark hair, oh Lord  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
  
See that girl  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down  
Comin' on down

Que um dia  
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus  
Foi na cruz  
Que um dia  
Foi na cruz  
  
Love comes a-knocking  
Comes a-knocking upon our door  
But you, you and me, love  
We don't live here any more  
  
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz  
Que um dia  
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus  
Foi na cruz  
Que um dia  
Foi na cruz  
  
A little sleep, a little slumber  
A little folding of the hands to sleep  
A little love, a little hate, babe  
A little trickery and deceit  
  
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz  
Que um dia  
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus  
Foi na cruz  
Que um dia  
Foi na cruz  
  
Dream on 'till you can dream no more  
For all our grand plans, babe  
Will be dreams forever more  
  
Foi na cruz, foi na cruz  
Que um dia  
Meus pecados castigados em Jesus  
Foi na cruz  
Que um dia  
Foi na cruz

Ah wanna tell ya 'bout a girl  
You kno, she lives in Apt. 29  
Why... That's the one right up top a mine  
Ah start to cry, Ah start to cry  
O ah hear her walkin  
Walkin barefoot cross the floor-boards  
All thru this lonesome night  
And ah hear her crying too.  
Hot-tears come splashin on down  
Leaking thru the cracks,  
Down upon my face, ah catch'em in my mouth!  
Walk'n'cry Walk'n'cry-y!!!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
Ah read her diary on her sheets  
Scrutinizin every lil piece of dirt  
Tore out a page'n'stufft it inside my shirt  
Fled outa the window,  
And shinning it down the vine  
Outa her night-mare, and back into mine  
Mine! O Mine!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
Cry! Cry! Cry!  
She's wearing them bloo-stockens, ah bet!  
And standin like this with my ear to the ceiling  
Listen ah kno it must sound absurd  
But ah can hear the most melancholy sound  
Ah ever heard!  
Walk'n'cry! Kneel'n'cry-y!  
From her to eternity!  
From her to eternity!  
O tell me why? Why? Why?  
Why the ceiling still shakes?  
Why the fixtures turn to serpants snakes?  
This desire to possess her is a wound  
And it's naggin at me like a shrew  
But, ah kno, that to possess her  
Is, therefore, not to desire her.  
O o o then ya kno, that lil girl would just have to go!  
Go! Go-o-o! From her to eternity!

Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready tot love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Get readyl  
  
Well, most of all nothing much  
Ever really happens  
And God rides high up in the ordinary sky  
Until we find ourselves at out most distracted  
And the miracle that was promised  
Creeps quietly by  
  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
  
The mighty wave their hankies from their  
High-windowed palace  
Sending grief and joy down in supportable doses  
And we search high and low without  
Merty or malice  
While the gate to the Kingdom swings  
Shut and closes  
  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
  
Praise Him till you've forgotten  
What you're praising Him for  
Praise Him till you've forgotten  
What you're praising Him for  
Then praise Him a little bit more  
  
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more  
Praise Him till you've forgotten  
What you're praising Him for  
Praise Him tillyou've forgotten what  
You're praising Him for  
Praise Him a little bit more  
Yeah, praise Him a little bit more  
  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Get ready!  
  
I searched the seven seas and I've looked  
Under the carpet  
And browsed through the brochures  
That govern the skies  
Then I was just hanging around, doing  
Nothing und looked up to see  
His face burned in the retina of your eyes  
  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
Calling every boy and girl  
Calling all around the world  
  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!  
Get ready for love! Praise Him!

Childhood days in a simmer haze  
Give us a kiss  
In the blue you whisper into the music  
And the feel underneath the foam bush  
Give us a kiss  
Hold me over, passing down  
Pass the blood factory and the town  
Come on, give us a kiss  
One that will sip, sip, sip  
Before you slip, slip, slip away  
  
Yeah, I'm still hanging out in your blue tunes  
In your sizzling shoes in my dreams  
Give us a kiss  
One little sip, sip, sip  
Before I catch, catch, catch  
I'll find, I'll be a good girl  
And it burns  
Kiss  
  
You want me to burn away  
You want me to burn away  
You want me to burn away  
If you want me to burn away

We've laid the cables and the wires  
We've split the wood and stoked the fires  
We've lit our town so there is no  
Place for crime to hide  
Our little church is painted white  
And in the safety of the night  
We all go quiet as a mouse  
For the word is out  
That God is in the house  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
No cause for worry now  
God is in the house  
Moral sneaks in the White House  
Computer geeks in the school house  
Drug freaks in the crack house  
We don't have that stuff here  
We have a tiny little Force  
But we need them of course  
For the kittens in the trees  
And at night we are on our knees  
As quiet as a mouse  
For God is in the house  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
And no one's left in doubt  
God is in the house  
Homos roaming the streets in packs  
Queer bashers with tire-jacks  
Lesbian counter-attacks  
That stuff is for the big cities  
Our town is very pretty  
We have a pretty little square  
We have a woman for a mayor  
Our policy is firm but fair  
Now that God is in the house  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
Any day now he will come out  
God is in the house  
Well-meaning little therapists  
Goose-stepping twelve-stepping Tetotalltarianists  
The tipsy, the reeling and the drop down pissed  
We got no time for that stuff here  
Zero crime and no fear  
We've bred all our kittens white  
So that you can see them in the night  
And at night we're on our knees  
As quiet as a mouse  
Since the word got out  
From the North down to the South  
For no-one's left in doubt  
There's no fear about  
If we all hold hands and very quietly shout  
Hallelujah  
God is in the house  
God is in the house  
Oh I wish he would come out  
God is in the house

A grief came riding  
On the wind  
Up the [Solemn] river Thames  
I was sittin' on the bank with my mouth open  
When I felt it entering  
  
I began thinkin' about our wedding day  
And how love was a vow  
I was thinkin' about the chamber door  
Only we can enter now  
  
I began thinkin' about our ancient friends  
And of kissin' them goodbye  
And then the wind blew under Battersea bridge  
And a tear broke from my eye  
  
I started thinkin' about London  
[How] nothing good ever came from this town  
And if the Thames weren't so filthy  
I would jump in the river and drown  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
Thinking loud  
  
[A grief came riding on the wind  
Up the river where the bridges crouch  
Blowin' people back and forth  
From the marital bed to the psychiatric couch]  
  
Blowin' people far apart  
Blowin' others so they collide  
Blowin' some poor bastard right out of the water  
Blowin' another one over the side  
  
Hear the ancient iron bridge  
And listen to it groan  
With the weight of a thousand people  
Leavin' or returning home  
  
To their failures  
To their bordoms  
To their husbands  
And their [wives]  
Who are carving them up for dinner  
Before they even arrive  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
[Thinking loud]  
  
Now look there just [Below] the water  
See the saviour of the human race,  
[with] the fishes and the frogs,  
Has found his final resting place  
  
Don't be afraid  
Come on down  
I'm just sittin' here  
[Thinking loud]

On the first day of May I took to the road  
I'd been staring out the window most of the morning  
I'd watched the rain claw at the glass  
And a vicious wind blew hard and fast  
I should have taken it as a warning  
As a warning As a warning  
As a warning  
  
I'd given my nurse the weekend off  
My meals were ill prepared  
My typewriter had turned mute as a tomb  
And my piano crouched in the corner of my room  
With all its teeth bared  
All its teeth bared All its teeth bared  
All its teeth bared.  
  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
  
I left my house without my coat  
Something my nurse would not have allowed  
And I took the small roads out of town  
And I passed a cow and the cow was brown  
And my pajamas clung to me like a shroud  
Like a shroud Like a shroud  
Like a shroud  
  
There rose before me a little house  
With all hope and dreams kept within  
A woman's voice close to my ear  
Said, "Why don't you come in here?"  
"You looked soaked to the skin"  
Soaked to the skin Soaked to the skin  
Soaked to the skin  
  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
Hallelujah Hallelujah  
  
I turned to the woman and the woman was young  
I extended a hearty salutation  
But I knew if my nurse had been here  
She would never in a thousand years  
Permit me to accept that invitation  
Invitation That invitation  
That invitation  
  
Now, you might think it wise to risk it all  
Throw caution to the reckless wind  
But with her hot cocoa and her medication  
My nurse had been my one salvation  
So I turned back home  
I turned back home I turned back home  
Singing my song  
  
Hallelujah  
The tears are welling in my eyes again  
Hallelujah  
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in  
Hallelujah  
And twenty pretty girls to carry  
Them down  
Hallelujah  
And twenty deep holes to bury them in  
Hallelujah  
The tears are welling in my eyes again  
Hallelujah  
I need twenty big buckets to catch them in  
Hallelujah  
And twenty pretty girls to carry them down  
Hallelujah  
And twenty deep holes to bury them in

Hamlet fishin' in the grave  
Thru custard bones and stuff  
He aint got no friend in there  
I believe our man's in love  
Hamlet's got a gun-now  
He wears a crucifex  
Pow pow pow pow  
Hamlet moves so beautiful  
Walking thru the flowers  
Who are hing 'round the corners  
He's movin' down the street-now  
He likes the look of that cadillac  
Pow pow pow pow  
Is this love some kinda love  
Now he movin' down my street  
And he's coming to my house  
Crawling up my stairs  
Where for art thou baby-face  
Where-for-art-thou  
Pow pow pow pow  
Is this love  
Pow!  
He shoot it inside  
Don't let'em steal your heart away  
He went and stole my heart  
Pow!!  
Hey hey hey  
Pow!!

It's a very happy day  
We are at lots of fun fun fun  
And it's ice-cream and jelly  
And a punch in the belly  
How much can you throw over the walls?  
  
And see how his face glows  
It's a bike! What a surprise.  
It's a big bike. What a big surprise.  
It's a red bike. What a red surprise.  
Oh, what a surprise.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Was the wonderful dog chair  
Was the beautiful dog chair  
That could count right up to ten  
It could count right up to ten  
It went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,  
Woof, woof, woof, woof, woof.  
  
And it's another happy day.  
He was born eleven years ago  
And this year it's long trousers  
And a very smart tie.  
Just think in five years he'll be shaving.  
  
And see how his face glows  
It's a bike. What a surprise!  
It's a samurai sword.  
What a metal surprise.  
He'll remember this day for the rest of his life.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Is that fabulous dog chair  
The immaculate dog chair  
That could count right up to eleven  
  
It could count right up to eleven  
It went woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof, woof,  
Woof, woof, woof.  
  
But the best thing there  
But the best thing there  
Was my darling the dog chair  
But the rampaging dog chair  
That could count right up to eleven  
It could count right up to eleven.  
  
And it went round and round the house.

It is for she that the cherry bleeds  
That the moon is steeped in mild nad blood  
Taht I steal like a robber  
From her altar of love  
O money lender! O clover gender!  
I am the fiend hid in her skirts  
And it's as hot as hell in here  
Coming at her as I am from above  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
Well, I swear I seen that girl before  
Like she walked straight outa the book of Leveticus  
But they can stone me with stones I don't care  
Just as long as I can get to kiss  
Those gypsy lips! Gypsy lips!  
My aim is to hit this Miss  
And I'm moving in (I'm moving in)  
Coming at her like Lazarus from above  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
The Lord is my shepard I shall not want  
The Lord is my shepard I shall not want  
But he ledeth me like a lamb to the lips  
Of the mouth of the valley of the whadow of death  
I am his rod and his staff  
I am his sceptre and shaft  
And she is heaven and hell  
At whose gates I ain't been delivered  
I'm gunna give the gates a shove  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
And her breasts rise and fall  
Breast rise and fall  
Breast rise and fall  
Breast rise and fall  
And just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
You are beautiful! O dove!  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
Her breasts rise and fall  
Her breasts rise and fall  
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
Just when I'm about to get my hands on her  
Hard on for love hard on for love  
Hard on for love hard on for love

In his boat and through the dark he rowed  
Chained to oar and the night and the wind that blowed  
Horribly 'round his ears  
Under the bridge and into your dreams he soars  
While you lie alone in that idea-free sleep of yours  
That you've been sleeping now for years  
  
And he wants you  
He wants you  
He is straight and he is true  
Ooh hoo hoo  
  
Beneath the hanging cliffs and under the many stars where  
He will move, all amongst your tangled hair  
And deep into the sea  
And you will wake and walk and draw the blind  
And feel some presence there behind  
And turn to see what that may be  
Oh, babe, it's me  
  
And he wants you  
He wants you  
He is straight and he is true  
Ooh hoo hoo

There is a town in north Ontario  
And I take comfort from memories there  
And in my mind I still need a place to go  
All my best changes were there  
  
Blue, blue windows behind the stars  
Yellow moon on the rise  
Big birds flying across the sky  
Throwing shadows on our eyes  
Leave us helpless, helpless, helpless, helpless  
Baby, heal me now  
  
The chains are locked and tied across the door  
They seem to help me somehow

Despair and Deception, Love's ugly little twins  
Came a-knocking on my door, I let them in  
Darling, you're the punishment for all of my former sins  
I let love in  
I let love in  
The door it opened just a crack, but Love was shrewed and bold  
My life flashed before my eyes, it was a horror to behold  
A life-sentence sweeping confetti from the floor of a concrete hole  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
Well I've been bound and gagged and I've been terrorized  
And I've been castrated and I've been lobotomized  
But never has my tormenter come in such a cunning disguise  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
O Lord, tell me what I done  
Please don't leave me here alone  
Where are my friends?  
My friends are gone  
O Lord, tell me what I done  
Please don't leave me here alone  
Where are my friends?  
My friends are gone  
I let love in  
I let love in  
So if you're sitting all alone and hear a-knocking at you door  
And the air is full of promises, well buddy, you've been warned  
Far worse to be Love's lover than the lover that Love has scorned  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in  
I let love in

John Lee Hooker - Vocal, Acoustic Guitar (Orpheum Music, 1959)  
  
A traditional song similar to My Little Boat Is Empty. Nick's song is also
available.  
  
You know I rowed a little boat,  
Five miles 'cross the pond  
You know I rowed a little boat,  
'bout five miles 'cross the pond  
I throwed my things in the little boat,  
It rolled me right along  
  
  
It was thunderin' and lightenin',  
But it rolled me right along  
It was thunderin', it was lightenin',  
Oh yeah, it rolled me right along  
There were thousands of people,  
They didn't have no place to go, mmm  
  
  
Little children they were screamin'  
And cryin', Oh yeah  
The wind was howlin',  
They didn't have no place to go, mmm  
There were thousands o' people,  
They's goin' from door to door, mmm  
  
  
My little boat kept rollin',  
It kept on rollin',  
You know it rolled me right along  
Mmm-mmm, Kept on rollin,  
Kept on rollin' Kept on rollin'  
Kept on rollin', Rollin'

They're taking me down, my friend  
And as they usher me off to my end  
Will I bid you adieu?  
Or will I be seeing you soon?  
If what they say around here is true  
Then we'll meet again  
Me and you  
  
My time is at hand, my dove  
They're gonna pass me to that house above  
Is heaven just for victims, dear?  
Where only those in pain go?  
Well it takes two to tango  
We will meet again, my love  
I know  
  
If you're in heaven then you'll forgive me, dear  
Because that's what they do up there  
If you're in hell, then what can I say  
You probably deserved in anyway  
I guess I'm gonna find out any day  
For we'll meet again  
And there'll be hell to pay  
  
Your face comes to me from the depths, dear  
Your silent mouth mouths, 'yes', dear  
Dark red and big with blood  
They're gonna shut me down, my love  
They're gonna launch me into the stars  
Well, all things come to pass  
Glory hallelujah  
  
This prayer is for you, my love  
Sent on the wings of a dove  
An idiot prayer of empty words  
Love, dear, is strictly for the birds  
We each get what we deserve  
My little snow white dove  
Rest assured

It was a miracle I even got outta longwood alive,  
This town fulla men with big mouths and no guts,  
I mean, if you can just picture it,  
The whole third floor of the hotel gutted by the blast,  
And the street below showered in shards of broken glass,  
And all the drunks pourin' outta the dance halls,  
Starin' up at the smoke and the flames,  
And the blind pencil seller wavin' his stick,  
Shoutin' for his dog that lay dead on the side of the road,  
And me, if you can believe this, at the wheel of the car  
Closin my eyes and actually prayin',  
Not to god above, but to you, sayin',  
  
Help me girl, help me girl  
I'll love you till the end of the world  
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls  
  
Some things we plan, we sit and we invent and we plot and cook up,  
Others are works of inspiration, of poetry,  
And it was this genius hand that pushed me up the hotel stairs  
To say my last goodbye,  
To her hair white as snow, and her pale blue eyes,  
Saying "I gotta go, I gotta go, the bomb and the bread basket  
Are ready to blow,"  
In this town of men with big mouths and no guts,  
The pencil seller's dog spooked by the explosion  
And leapin' under my wheels as I careered outta longwood on my way to you,  
Waiting in your dress, in your dress of blue  
  
I said thank you girl, thank you girl  
I'll love you till the end of the world  
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls  
  
And with the horses prancin' through the fields,  
With my knife in my jeans and the rain on the shield,  
I sang a song for the glory of the beauty of you,  
Waiting for me in your dress of blue  
  
Thank you girl, thank you girl  
I'll love you till the end of the world  
With your eyes black as coal and your long dark curls

As the snow flies  
On a cold and grey Chicago morn  
A poor little baby child is born in the ghetto  
  
And his mama cries  
Cause there's one thing that she don't need  
Is another little hungry mouth to feed in the ghetto  
  
Oh people don't you understand  
This child needs a helping hand  
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day  
Take a look at you and me  
Are we that blind to see?  
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?  
  
And the world turns  
And the hungry little boy with the runny nose  
Plays in the streets as the cold wind blows in the ghetto  
And his hunger burns  
So he starts to roam the streets at night  
And he learns how to steal and he learns how to fight in the ghetto  
  
Then one night in desperation  
The young man breaks away  
He buys a gun and steals a car  
He tries to run but he don't get far  
And his mama cries  
A crowd gathers round an angry young man  
Face down in the street with a gun in his hand in the ghetto  
  
Oh people don't you understand  
This child needs a helping hand  
He's gonna grow to be an angry young man some day  
Take a look at you and me  
Are we that blind to see?  
Do we simply turn our heads and look the other way?  
  
And as her young man dies  
On a cold and grey Chicago morn  
Another little baby child is born in the ghetto

I don't believe in an interventionist god  
But I know, darling, that you do  
But if I did I would kneel down and ask him  
Not to intervene when it came to you  
Not to touch a hair on your head  
To leave you as you are  
And if he felt he had to direct you  
Then direct you into my arms  
  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms  
  
And I don't believe in the existence of angels  
But looking at you I wonder if that's true  
But if I did I would summon them together  
And ask them to watch over you  
To each burn a candle for you  
To make bright and clear your path  
And to walk, like christ, in grace and love  
And guide you into my arms  
  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms  
  
And I believe in love  
And I know that you do too  
And I believe in some kind of path  
That we can walk down, me and you  
So keep your candlew burning  
And make her journey bright and pure  
That she will keep returning  
Always and evermore  
  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms, o lord  
Into my arms

As I walk these narrow streets  
Where a million passin feet have trod before me  
With my guitar in my hand  
Suddenly I realize nobody knows me  
  
Where yesterday the multitude  
Screamed and cried my name out for a song  
Today the streets are empty  
And the crowds have all gone home  
  
I pass a million houses  
But there is no place that I belong  
All I knew to give you  
Was song after song after song  
  
All the truths I tried to tell you  
Were as distant to you as the moon  
Born 200 years too late  
And 200 years too soon  
  
I'm a child of this age  
Locked into the pages of your book  
And when I am but dust and clay  
And all the children stop to take a look  
  
Will they marvel at the miracles I did perform  
And the heights I did aspire  
Or will they tear out the pages of the book  
To light a fire  
  
With the rain on my face  
There is no place that I belong  
Did you forget this fucking singer so soon?  
And did you forget my song?

I got a woman  
She rules my house with an iron fist  
I got a woman  
She rules my house with an iron fist  
She screams out Jack the Ripper  
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss  
  
I got a woman  
She strikes me down with a fist of lead  
I got a woman  
She strikes me down with a fist of lead  
We bed in a bucket of butcher's knives  
A awake with a hatchet hanging over my head  
  
Well you know the story of the viper  
It's long and lean with poison tooth  
Yeah, you know the story of the viper  
It's long and lean it's got a poison tooth  
Well they're hissing under the floorboards  
Hanging down in bunches from my roof  
  
I got a woman  
She just hollers what she wants from where she's at  
I got a woman  
She just hollers what she wants from where she is  
She screams out Jack the Ripper  
Every time I try to give that girl a kiss

They dragged Jack and his shadow  
From the hole  
And the bulb that burned above him  
Did shine both day and night  
And his shadow learned to love his  
Little darks and greater light  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
A little longer  
Jack wept and kissed his shadow  
"Goodbye"  
Spat from their dirty dungeons  
Into a truly different din  
Shat from their institutions  
Into a fully different din  
And his shadow soon became a wife  
And children plagued his latter life  
Until one night he took a skinning knife  
And stole into the town  
And tracked his shadow down  
Said the shadow to Jack Henry  
"What's wrong?"  
Jack said "A home is not a hole"  
"And shwdow, you're just a gallow that I hang my body from"  
"O Shadow, your a shackle from wich my time is never done"  
Then he peeled his shadow off in strips  
He peeled his shadow off in strips  
Then kneeled his shadow on some steps  
And cried "What have I done?"  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
I say "Love is blind"  
"And is it any wonder?!"  
"And is it any wonder?!"  
Jacked and his damned shadow  
Is gone  
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn  
And though each one of us are want to duly mourn  
'Tis done in brighter corners now  
'Tis done in brighter corners now  
Now that Jack's black shadow's gone  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
And the sun it shined  
A little stronger  
I swear, love is blind  
Ooh, love is blind  
Yeah, love is blind  
And is it any wonder?  
'Tis done in brighter corners now  
'Tis done in brighter corners now  
Now that Jack's black shadow's gone  
Etcetera Etcetera

These chains of sorrow, they are heavy, it is true  
And these locks cannot be broken,  
No, not with one thousand keys  
O Jailer, you wear a ball-n-chain you cannot see  
You can lay your burden on me  
You can lay your burden down on me  
You can lay your burden down upon me  
But you cannot lay down those memories.  
Woooo wooo wooo  
Woooo wooo wooo  
Here I go!  
Knockin on Joe!  
This square foot of sky will be mine til I die  
Knocking on Joe  
Woooo wooo wooo  
All down the row.  
Knockin on Joe.  
O Warden I surrender you  
Your fists cain't hurt me anymore  
You know, these hands will never wash  
These dirty Death Row floors  
O Preacher, come closer, you don't scare me anymore  
Just tell Nancy not to come here  
Just tell her not to come here anymore  
Tell Nancy not to come  
And let me die in the memory of her arms.  
O woo woo woo  
Woo woo woo  
All down the row.  
Knockin on Joe.  
O you kings of halls and ends of halls  
You will die within these walls  
And I'll go, all down the row  
Knockin on Joe.  
O Nancy's body is a coffin,  
She wears my tombstone at her head  
O Nancy's body is a coffin,  
She wears my tombstone at her head  
She wears her body like a coffin  
She wears a dress of gold and red  
She wears a dress of gold and red  
She wears a dress of red and gold  
Grave-looters at my coffin  
Before my bodies even cold.  
It's a door for when I go  
Knockin on Joe  
These hands will never mop  
Your dirty Death Row floors  
No! You can hide! You can run!  
O but your trial is yet to come  
O you can run! You can hide!  
But you have yet to be tried!  
You can lay your burden down here  
You can lay your burden down here  
Knockin on Joe  
You can lay your burden upon me  
You can lay your burden down upon me  
Knockin on Joe  
You cain't hurt me anymore  
Knockin on Joe.  
(ad lib)

I've seen your fairground hair,  
Your seaside eyes  
Your vampire tooth, your little truth  
Your tiny lies  
  
I know your trembling hand, your guilty prize  
Your sleeping limbs, your foreign hymns  
Your midnight cries  
  
So dry your eyes  
And turn your head away  
Now there's nothing more to say  
Now you're gone away  
  
I know your trail of tears, your slip of hand  
Your monkey claw, your monkey paw  
And your monkey hand  
  
I've seen your trick of blood, your trap of fire  
Your ancient wound, your scarlet moon  
And your jailhouse smile  
  
So dry your eyes  
And turn your head away  
Now there's nothing more to say  
Now you're gone away  
  
I'll miss your urchin smile, your orphan tears  
Your shining prize, your tiny cries  
Your little fears  
I'll miss your fairground hair, your seaside eyes  
Your little truth, your vampire tooth  
And your tiny lies  
  
So dry your eyes  
And turn your head away  
Now there's nothing more to say  
Now you're gone away  
(Repeat)

They're gonna lay me low (Lay me low)  
They're gonna sink me in the snow  
They're gonna throw back their heads and crow  
When I go  
They're gonna jump and shout (Lay me low)  
They're gonna wave their arms about  
All the stories will come out  
When I go  
All the stars will glow bright (Lay me low)  
And my friends will give up the fight  
They'll see my work in a different light  
When I go  
They'll try telephoning my mother (Lay me low)  
But they'll end up getting my brother  
Who'll spill the story on some long-gone lover  
That I hardly know  
Hats off to the man  
On top of the world  
Come crawl up here, baby  
And I'll show you how it works  
If you wanna be my friend  
And you wanna repent  
And you want it all to end  
And you wanna know when  
Well do it now don't care how  
Take your final bow  
Make a stand Take my hand  
And blow it all to hell  
They gonna inform the police chief (Lay me low)  
Who'll breathe a sigh of relief  
He'll say I was a malanderer, a badlander, and a thief  
When I go  
They will interview my teachers (Lay me low)  
Who'll say I was one of God's sorrier creatures  
There'll print informative six-page features  
When I go  
They'll bang a big old gong (Lay me low)  
The motorcade will be ten miles long  
The world will join together for a farewell song  
When they put me down below  
They'll sound a fluegelhorn (Lay me low)  
And the sea will rage, and the sky will storm  
All man and beast will mourn  
When I go  
Hats off to the man  
On top of the world  
Come crawl up here, baby  
And we can watch this damn thing turn  
If you wanna be my friend  
And you wanna repent  
And you want it all to end  
And you wanna know when  
Well do it now Do it now  
Take a long last bow  
Take my hand Make a stand  
And blow it all to hell  
Lay me low...  
When I go...

When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
And in my hour of darkness  
  
She is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Living in the world agree  
There will be an answer, let it be  
For though they may be parted  
  
There is still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
  
Yeah there will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Ah let it be, yeah let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
And when the night is cloudy  
  
There is still a light that shines on me  
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music,  
Mother Mary comes to me  
  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
Yeah let it be, let it be  
Let it be, yeah let it be  
Oh there will be an answer, let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Let it be, yeah let it be  
Oh there will be an answer, let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be  
Ah let it be, yeah let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

C'mon, kind Sir, let's walk outside  
And breathe the autumn air  
See the many that have lived and died  
See the unending golden stair  
See all of us that have come behind  
Clutching at your hem  
All the way from Arkansas  
To your sweet and last amen  
  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real thing  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real, real thing  
  
Take this deafening thunder down  
Take this bread and take this wine  
Your passing is not what we mourn  
But the world you left behind  
Well, do not breathe, nor make a sound  
And behold your mighty work  
That towers over the uncaring ground  
Of a lesser, darker world  
  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real thing  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real, real thing  
  
There are those of us not fit to tie  
The laces of your shoes  
Must remain behind to testify  
Through an elementary blues  
So, let's walk outside, the hour is late  
Through your crumbs and scattered shells  
Where the awed and the mediocre wait  
Barely fit to ring the bells  
  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real thing  
Let the bells ring  
He is the real, real thing

The Boatman calls from the lake  
A lone loon dives upon the water  
I put my hand over hers  
Down in the lime tree arbour  
The wind in the trees is whispering  
Whispering low thar I love her  
She puts her hand over mine  
Down in the lime tree arbour  
Through every step that I take  
And every place I go  
There is a hand that protects me  
And I do love her so  
There will always be suffering  
It flows through life like water  
I put my hand over hers  
Down the lime tree arbour  
The Boatman he is gone  
The loons have flown for cover  
She puts her hand over mine  
Down the lime tree arbour  
Through every word that I speak  
And everything I know  
There is a hand that protects me  
And I do love her so

Janey's gone now and she won't be back no more  
It was only yesterday I went knocking on her door  
Now she's gone away  
We won't see her no more

Now she's gone  
Don't you see  
They're gonna throw away the key  
  
Little Janey's gone down  
Janey's gone down  
Janey's gone away

(D. Del, M. Wilkins)  
  
She walks these hills in a long black veil  
She visits my grave when the night winds wail  
Nobody knows, nobody sees  
Nobody knows but me  
  
  
Ten years ago, on a cold dark night  
Someone was killed 'neath the Town Hall light  
There were few at the scene, but they all agreed  
That the slayer who ran looked a lot like me  
  
  
The judge he said: Son, what is your alibi  
If you were somewhere else, then you won't have to die  
But I spoke not a word though it meant my life  
For I'd been in the arms of my best friends wife  
  
  
Now the scaffold is high and eternity is near  
She stood in the crowd but she'd not a tear  
But sometimes at night when the cold winds moan  
In a long black veil she cries on my bones

Words and Music by Bob Dylan (1993 Special Rider Music)  
  
Original version of Henry Lee. Nick's version is also available.  
  
"Get down, get down, Love Henry," she cried,  
"And stay all night with me.  
I have gold chains, and the finest I have  
I'll apply them all to thee. "  
  
"I can't get down and I shan't get down,  
Or stay all night with thee.  
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville  
I love far better than thee. "  
  
He laid his head on a pillow of down.  
Kisses she gave him three.  
With a penny knife that she held in her hand  
She murdered mortal he.  
  
"Get well, get well, Love Henry, " she cried,  
"Get well, get well," said she.  
"Oh don't you see my own heart's blood  
Come flowin' down so free? "  
  
She took him by his long yellow hair,  
And also by his feet.  
She plunged him into well water, where  
It runs both cold and deep.  
  
"Lie there, lie there, Love Henry," she cried,  
"Til the flesh rots off your bones.  
Some pretty little girl in Cornersville  
Will mourn for your return. "  
  
"Hush up, hush up, my parrot," she cried,  
"Don't tell no news on me,  
Or these costly beads around my neck,  
I'll apply them all to thee.  
  
"Fly down, fly down, pretty parrot," she cried,  
"And light on my right knee.  
The doors to your cage shall be decked with gold  
And hung on a willow tree. "  
  
"I won't fly down, I can't fly down  
And light on your right knee.  
A girl who would murder her own true love  
Would kill a little bird like me. "

L hold d this letter in my hand  
A plea of petition, a kind of prayer  
I hope it does as I have planned  
Losing her again is more than I can bear  
  
I kiss the cold white envelope  
Press my lips against her name  
Two hundred words, we live in hope  
The sky hangs heavy with rain  
  
Love letter, love letter  
Go get her, go get her  
Love letter, love letter  
Go tell her, go tell her  
  
A wicked wind whips up the hill  
Hand full of hopeful words  
I love her and I always will  
The sky is ready to burst  
  
Said something I did not mean to say  
Said something I did not mean to say  
Said something I did not mean to say  
It all came out the wrong way  
  
Love letter, love letter  
Go get her, go get her  
Love letter, love letter  
Go tell her, go tell her  
  
Rain your kisses down upon me  
Rain your kisses down in storms  
For all will come before me  
In your thin and fading forms  
  
Out of my mind  
Will leave me standing in the rain  
With a letter and a prayer  
Whispered on the wind  
  
Come back to me  
Come back to me  
Oh, baby, please come back to me

Last night I lay trembling  
The moon it was low  
It was the end of love  
Of misery and woe  
  
Then suddenly above me  
Her face buried in light  
Came a vision of beauty  
All covered in white  
  
Now the bell-tower is ringing  
And the night has stole past  
O Lucy, can you hear me?  
Wherever you rest  
  
I'll love her forever  
I'll love her for all time  
I'll love her till the stars  
Fall down from the sky  
Now the bell-tower is ringing  
And I shake on the floor  
O Lucy, can you hear me?  
When I call and call  
  
Now the bell-tower is ringing  
And the moon it is high  
O Lucy, can you hear me  
When I cry and cry and cry

See the shark with teeth like razors  
And he wears them in his face  
And Macheath has got a knife  
But not in such an obvious place  
  
Now see the shark, how red his fins are  
As he slashes at his prey  
Mack the Knife wears fancy gloves  
Which gives a minimum away  
  
By the Thames' turbid waters  
Men abruptly tumble down  
Well is it plague, or is it cholera  
Or because Macky's in town?  
  
And the child bride, in her nighty  
Whose assailant's still at large  
Violated in her slumbers  
Macky how much did you charge?  
  
In the ghastly fire in Soho  
Seven children had a go  
In the crowd stands Mack the Knife  
But he isn't asked and he don't know  
  
In the crowd stands Mack The Knife  
But he ain't asked and he don't know

I stood in the water  
In the middle month of winter  
My camel skin was torture  
I was in a state of nature  
The wind, sir, it was wicked  
I was so alone  
Just as I predicted  
My followers were gone  
  
And I cried 'Mercy'  
Have mercy upon me  
And I got down on my knees  
  
Thrown into a dungeon  
Bread and water was my portion  
Faith - my only weapon  
To rest the devil's legion  
The speak-hole would slide open  
A viper's voice would plead  
Thick with innuendo  
Syphilis and Greed  
  
And she cried 'Mercy'  
Have mercy upon me  
And I told her to get down on her knees  
  
In a garden full of roses  
My hands, tied behind me  
My cousin was working miracles  
I wondered if he'd find me  
The moon was turned toward me  
Like a platter made of gold  
My death, it almost bored me  
So often was it told  
  
And I cried 'Mercy'  
I cried mercy on me  
Cryind 'Mercy'  
Have mercy on me

She was a catch,  
We were a match  
I was the match that would fire up her snatch  
There was a catch  
I was no match  
I was fired from her crutch  
Now I sit around and watch  
The mermaids sun themselves out on the rocks  
They are beyond our touch  
I watch and watch  
Wave at me  
They wave at me  
They wave and slip  
Back into the sea  
  
All the ones who come  
All the ones who go  
Down to the water  
All the ones who come  
All the ones who go  
Down to the sea  
  
I believe in God  
I believe in mermaids too  
I believe in 72 virgins on a chain (why not, why not)  
I believe in the rapture  
For I've seen your face  
On the floor of the ocean  
At the bottom of the ray  
  
I do drive a relentless course  
I do husband alertness course  
I do mermaid alertness course  
Watch them out on the rocks  
Wave at me  
Wave at me  
They wave and slip  
Back into the sea  
  
All the ones who come  
All the ones who go  
Down to the water  
All the ones who come  
And all the ones who go  
Down to the sea  
  
For all the ones who come  
And all the ones who go  
Down to the water  
All the ones who come  
And all the ones who go  
Down to the sea

I hope you're sitting comfortably  
I saved you the best seat in the house  
Right up in the front row  
The stars have been torn down  
The moon is locked away  
And the land is banked in frozen snow  
  
You are a forte of nature, dear  
Your breath curls from your lips  
As the trees bend down their branches  
And touch you with their fingertips  
They're bringing out the dead now  
It's easy just to look away  
They are bringing out the dead now  
It's been a strange, strange day  
  
We could navigate out position by the stars  
But they've taken out the stars  
The stars have all gone  
I'm glad you've come along  
We could comprehend our  
Condition by the moon  
But they've ordered the the moon not to shine  
Still, I 'm glad you've come along  
I was worried out of my mind  
Cause, they keep bringing out the dead  
It's easy just to look away  
They're bringing out the dead, now  
And it's been a long, strange day  
  
You can move up a little closer  
I will throw a blanket over  
We can weigh all the tears in one hand  
Against the laughter in the other  
We could be hanging around here for centuries  
Trying to make sense of this, my dear  
While the planets try to get organised  
Way above the stratosphere  
But they keep bringing out the dead, now  
It's easy if we just walk away  
They keep bringing out the dead, now  
It's been a long, long day  
  
Look away  
Look away

Mister frog went a-courting and he did ride  
Uh-hmm, Uh-hmm  
Mister frog went a-courting and he did ride  
A sword and pistol by his side  
Uh-hmm, Uh-hmm.  
  
  
He went down to Missy Mousie's door  
Where he had often been before.  
  
  
He said, "Missy Mouse, are you within?"  
"Yes kind sir, I sit and spin."  
  
  
He took Missy Mouse upon his knee  
And said "Missy Mouse, will you marry me?"  
  
  
"Without my Uncle Rat's consent"  
"I wouldn't marry the pres-I-dent."  
  
  
Uncle Rat laughed and shook his fat sides,  
To think his niece would be a bride.  
  
  
When Uncle Rat gave his consent  
The weasel wrote the publishment.  
  
  
Where will the wedding supper be?  
Way down yonder in a holler tree.  
  
  
What will the wedding supper be?  
Two green beans and a black-eyed pea.  
  
  
The first guest in was a bumblebee  
He danced a jig with a crook-backed flea.  
  
  
The owl did hoot, the birds they sang  
And through the woods the music rang.  
  
  
They all went sailing 'cross the lake  
And got swallered up by a big black snake  
  
  
There's bread and cheese upon the shelf  
If you want any more you can sing it yourself.

They call him Joe The Dragon  
He's on the water wagon  
He's got that look of mourning and concentration on his face  
Carries a 38 special  
A six inch barrel  
The saddest damn man in the entire human race  
  
Mojo (4x)  
  
Joe's mind is full of motors(?)  
He is always taking photos  
Of the remains of his beserk little twists  
Yes ....(?) polaroids  
Of his little golden boys  
18 carat corpses with wired wrists  
  
Mojo (4x)  
  
Blood thicker than water will flow  
The fire will eat the streets of old Soho  
Daddy's out the back with little Joe  
With his vaseline and his violin and bow - Mojo  
  
Down on Compton(?) Road  
Joe ain't never going home  
Till he finds what he is searching for  
Well mad Mathildas in his jacket  
They crank and make him record(?)  
As he does and make his funny little laugh and dance upon your floor  
  
Mojo (repeat)  
  

I have a friend in you, oh Mr Clarinet  
You make me laugh, and then cry like the song of the clarinet.  
Marry me, marry me alive O  
I put on my coat of trumpets  
Will she be there? Is my piccolo on straight?  
  
  
Her white stockings and red dress that goes  
Swish, swish, swish around her legs of lace  
Marry me, marry me alive O  
  
  
Could you tell her  
Would you tell her for me,  
Oh Mr Clarinet confidant  
That I love her, love her, oh love her  
I love her but I can't [wait]  
  
  
Marry me, marry me alive O  
Oh maybe, oh maybe lie down  
  
  
I love her, love her, love her  
Love her love her love her love her

Mary, grab the baby, the river's rising  
Muddy water taking back the land  
The old-frame house, she can't take-a one more beating  
Ain't no use to stay and make a stand  
  
  
Well the morning light shows water in the valley  
Daddy's grave just went below the line  
Things to say, you just can't take em with ya  
This flood will swallow all you've left behind  
  
  
Won't be back to start all over  
Cause what I felt before is gone  
  
  
Mary, take the child, the river's rising  
Muddy water taking back my home  
The road is gone, there's just one way to leave here  
Turn my back on what I've left below  
Shifting land, broken farms around me  
Muddy water's changing all I know  
  
  
It's hard to say just what I'm losing  
Ain't never felt so all alone  
  
  
Mary, take the child, the river's rising  
Muddy water taking back my home  
  
  
Won't be back to start all over  
Cause what I felt before is gone  
  
  
Mary, take the child, the river's rising  
Muddy water's changing all I know  
Muddy water's changing all I know  
Lord, this muddy water is taking back my home

At the turn of the century I did many things to protect myself  
I did many things to protect myself  
I made myself a needle-boy  
And I Hid him in the closet  
And I made myself a money-man  
And I hid him underneath the mattress  
I made myself a spider-child  
And I put him in a matchbox  
And I forged myself a golden statuette  
And I wrapped him in a hello magazine  
And I hid I'm in a wall safe  
And finally I made myself a spade-girl  
And I put her in a garden she'd  
All to protect myself, you see  
From the demon that was coming from the East  
Or from the west  
Then I sat on the rooftop and I waited  
And when at last the demon came  
From the East or from the West  
And awoke me from my sleep  
And awoke me to a particular point of view  
And the needle-boy stuck him in the eye  
And the money-man chocked him with coins  
The spider-child bit him on the ankle  
And the statuette crashed crashed down upon his head  
And the spade-girl buried him underneath the house  
And I danced on the rooftops  
And I danced on the rooftops  
And I danced to the western world  
And I danced to the western world

One morn I awakened  
A new sun was shining  
The sky was a Kingdom  
All covered in blood  
The moon and the stars  
Where the troops that lay conquered  
Like fruit left to wither  
Poor spiritual food  
  
And the spears of bright sun  
All brave with it conquest  
Did hover unearthly  
In banners of fire  
I kneit in the garden  
Awash with the dawning  
And a voice came so brightly  
I covered my eyes  
  
Thank you for giving  
This bright new morning  
So steeped seemed the evening  
In darkness and blood  
There'll be no sadness  
There'll be no sorrow  
There'll be no road too narrow  
There'll be a new day  
And it's today  
For us

People just ain't no good  
I think that's well understood  
You can see it everywhere you look  
People just ain't no good  
We were married under cherry trees  
Under blossom we made pour vows  
All the blossoms come sailing down  
Through the streets and through the playgrounds  
The sun would stream on the sheets  
Awoken by the morning bird  
We'd buy the Sunday newspapers  
And never read a single word  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
Seasons came, Seasons went  
The winter stripped the blossoms bare  
A different tree now lines the streets  
Shaking its fists in the air  
The winter slammed us like a fist  
The windows rattling in the gales  
To which she drew the curtains  
Made out of her wedding veils  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good at all  
To our love send a dozen white lilies  
To our love send a coffin of wood  
To our love let all the pink-eyed pigeons coo  
That people they just ain't no good  
To our love send back all the letters  
To our love a valentine of blood  
To our love let all the jilted lovers cry  
That people they just ain't no good  
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad  
They can comfort you, some even try  
They nurse you when you're ill of health  
They bury you when you go and die  
It ain't that in their hearts they're bad  
They'd stick by you if they could  
But that's just bullshit  
People just ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good  
People they ain't no good at all

Plain gold ring on her finger she wore  
It was where everyone could see  
It belonged to someone, but not me  
On her hand she wore a plain gold ring  
  
  
Plain gold ring's got a story to tell  
It was one that I knew very well  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as she wears that plain gold ring  
  
  
When night time comes calling on me  
I know why I will never be free  
I can't stop these teardrops of mine, oh no  
I'm gonna love her till the end of time  
  
  
Plain gold ring's got but one thing to say  
I'm gonna love her till my dying day  
In my heart it will never be spring  
Long as she wears that plain gold ring

They're working us like dogs around here  
'Cause pleasure is the boss  
And I'm the happiest slave alive round here  
'Cause pleasure is the boss  
And nothing is safe that don't stand still  
If it's O. K. With the boss  
I'm gunna walk right up and take it yeah  
If it's O. K. With the boss  
  
Walk  
  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me  
What's O. K. With the boss is O. K. With me

I was right  
I was right  
Oh, the sun, the sun  
The sun is rising from the field  
  
I've got a feeling  
I just can't shake  
I've got a feeling  
That just won't go away  
  
You've got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And if your friends think  
That you should do it different  
And if they think  
That you should do it the same  
  
You've got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And if you're feeling  
You've got everything you came for  
If you got everything  
And you don't want no more  
  
You've got to just  
Keep on pushing  
Keep on pushing  
Push the sky away  
  
And some people  
Say it's just rock'n roll  
Oh, but it gets you  
Right down to your soul

Take a litle walk to the edge of town  
Go across the tracks  
Where the viaduct looms,  
Like a bird of doom  
As it shifts and cracks  
Where secrets lie in the border fires,  
In the humming wires  
Hey man, you know  
You're never coming back  
Past the square, past the bridge,  
Past the mills, past the stacks  
On a gathering storm comes  
A tall handsome man  
In a dusty black coat with  
A red right hand  
  
He'll wrap you in his arms,  
Tell you that you've been a good boy  
He'll rekindle all the dreams  
It took you a lifetime to destroy  
He'll reach deep into the hole,  
Heal your shrinking soul  
Hey buddy, you know you're  
Never ever coming back  
He's a god, he's a man,  
He's a ghost, he's a guru  
They're whispering his name  
Through this disappearing land  
But hidden in his coat  
Is a red right hand  
  
You ain't got no money?  
He'll get you some  
You ain't got no car? He'll get you one  
You ain't got no self-respect,  
You feel like an insect  
Well don't you worry buddy,  
Cause here he comes  
Through the ghettos and the barrio  
And the bowery and the slum  
A shadow is cast wherever he stands  
Stacks of green paper in his  
Red right hand  
  
(Organ solo)  
  
You'll see him in your nightmares,  
You'll see him in your dreams  
He'll appear out of nowhere but  
He ain't what he seems  
You'll see him in your head,  
On the tv screen  
And hey buddy, I'm warning  
You to turn it off  
He's a ghost, he's a god,  
He's a man, he's a guru  
You're one microscopic cog  
In his catastrophic plan  
Designed and directed by  
His red right hand  
  
(Organ solo)  
  
Extra verse from dj Spooky Remix (From Scream 2 Soundtrack):  
He'll extend his hand, real slowly for a shake  
You'll see it coming toward you, real slowly for a shake  
(Grabbing at your peril buddy?) cause you know you ain't  
Getting near much as he will take.  
  
He's a...  
  
He's mumbling words you can't understand  
He's mumbling word behind his red right hand.

When I get home, I'm gunna clean up my house  
When I get home, I'm gunna kick out that mouse  
When I get home, I'm gunna put things in order  
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna make that call  
When I get home, I'm gunna talk it through  
When I get home, I'm gunna straighten it out  
but right now, right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna give up the booze  
When I get home, I'm gunna get me some food  
When I get home, I'm gunna quit them drugs  
but right now, right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna call my mother  
When I get home, I'm gunna cook her some dinner  
When I get home, I'm gunna invite my brothers  
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna see my little boy  
When I get home, I'm buy him a little toy  
When I get home, he's gunna jump for joy  
but right now, right right now, right now I'm a-roaming  
  
When I get home, I'm gunna unpack my bags  
When I get home, I'm gunna waash these dirty rags  
When I get home, I'm gunna pack 'em up again  
but I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go, I'm gunna go right back roaming.

Please forgive me  
If I appear unkind  
But any fool can tell you  
It's all in your mind  
  
Down in the meadow  
The old lion stirs  
Puts his hand 'cross his mouth  
He has no use for words  
  
Poor little girl  
With your handful of snow  
Poor little girl  
Had no way to know  
  
And you've got me eating  
You've got me eating  
You've got me eating  
Right out of your hand  
  
I mean you no harm  
When I tell you you're blind  
Give a sucker an even break  
He'll lose it all, every time  
  
The airborne starlings circle  
Over the frozen fields  
The hollyhocks hang harmlessly  
And the old lion yields  
  
And you've got me eating  
You've got me eating  
You've got me eating  
Right out of your hand

I climbed the hill, lay in the grass  
A little dark-eyed girl drifted past  
She said all the best is come, it could not last  
And the worst, it has come true  
  
  
Her hands are small and fluttered up  
I lay amongst the buttercups  
I pulled on my coat and buttoned it up  
For the worst, it had come true  
  
  
Sail away, sail away  
To a place where your troubles can't follow  
Sail away, sail away  
Save all your tears for tomorrow  
  
  
Orphans of the city moved toward us  
And the swallows swooped and the starlings warned us  
And the peril in everything  
It assured us that the worst had come true  
  
  
And all my sorrows made their bed beside me  
The shame, the disgrace and the brutality  
And she whispered then "Let laughter flee."  
For the worst, it has come true  
  
  
Dry your tears, forget while we're here  
Leave all your sorrows behind you  
Never lose heart, all things will pass  
To a place where your troubles can't find you  
  
  
She came beside me amongst my coat  
Her breath was warm against my throat  
We clung to each other so very close  
For the worst, it had come true  
  
  
Sail away, sail away  
To a place where your heart will not shame you  
Take my hand through this night without end  
For the worst, it has come to claim you  
  
  
Sail away, sail away  
To a place where no one can betray you  
Take my hand through this night without end  
For the worst, it has come to claim you

Born of the river,  
Born of its ever-changing, never-changing murky water  
Oh riverboat just rollin' along through the great great greasy city Huck
standing like a Saint, upon its deck  
If ya wanna catch a Saint,  
then bait ya hook, let's take a walk...  
  
  
'O come to me!, O come to me!' is what the dirty city  
say to Huck... HUCK  
  
  
woah-woah, woah woah!  
woah-woah, woah woah!  
Saint Huck! Huck!  
  
  
Straight in the arms of the city goes Huck,  
down the beckonin' streets of op-po-tunity  
whistling his favorite river-song...  
And a bad-blind nigger at the piano  
Buts a sinister blooo lilt into that sing-a-long  
Huck senses somthing's wrong!  
  
  
Sirens wail in the city,  
and lil-Ulysses turn to putty  
and Ol Man River's got a bone to pick!  
and our boy's hardly got a bone to suck!  
He go, woah-woah, woah woah!  
woah-woah, woah woah!  
Saint Huck! Huck!  
  
  
The mo-o-o-on, its huge cycloptic eye  
watches the city streets contract  
twist and cripple and crack.  
Saint Huck goes on a dog's-leg now  
Saint Huck goes on a dog's-leg now  
  
  
You know the story!  
Ya wake up one morning and you find you're a thug  
blowing smoke rings in some dive  
Ya fingers hot and itchin, ya cracking ya knuckles  
Ya bull neck bristling...  
Still Huck he ventures on whistling,  
and Death reckons Huckleberry's time is up,  
O woah woah woah!  
Saint Huck!  
O woah woah woah!  
Saint Huck! Huck!  
  
  
Yonder go Huck, minus pocket-watch an' wallet gone  
Skin shrink-wraps his skeleton  
No wonder he gets thinner, what with his cold'n'skinny dinners!  
Saint Huck-a-Saint Elvis, Saint Huck-a-Saint Elvis  
O you recall the song ya used to sing-a-long  
Shifting the river-trade on that ol' steamer  
Life is but a dream!  
  
  
But ya traded in the Mighty ol' man River  
for the Dirty ol' Man Latrine!  
The brothel shift  
The hustle'n'the bustle and the green-backs rustle  
And all the sexy-cash  
And the randy-cars  
And the two dollar fucks  
O o o ya outa luck, ya outa luck  
Woah-woah-woah-woah  
Saint Huck! Huck!  
  
  
This is the track of deception  
leads to the heart of despair  
Huck whistles like he just don't care  
but in the pocket of the jacket is a chamber  
Lead pellets sleeps in there  
Wake Up!  
  
  
Now Huck whistles and he kneels  
and he lays down there  
See ya huck, good luck  
A smoke ring hovers above his head  
And the rats and the dogs and the men all come  
and put a bullet through his eye  
and the drip and the drip and the drip of the Mississippi cryin' And Saint
Huck hears his own Mississippi just rollin' by him Woah-woah-woah-woah  
Woah-woah-woah-woah  
Saint Huck! Saint Huck! Saint Huck!  
Woah-woah-woah-woah  
Woah-woah-woah-woah  
Saint Huck! Saint Huck! Saint Huck!  
Woah-woah-woah-woah

O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
To the little girl tree.  
This wall I built around you  
Is made out of stone-lies.  
O little girl the truth would be  
An axe in thee.  
O father look to your daughter  
Brick of grief and stricken morter.  
With this ring  
This silver hoop of wire  
I bind your maiden mainstream  
Just to keep you as a child.  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O you know that I must say goodbye  
To my little girl tree.  
How fast your candy bones  
Reached out for me.  
I must say goodbye to your brittle bones  
Crying out for me.  
O you know that I must say goodbye.  
O goodbye.  
Even though you will betray me  
The very minute that I leave.  
O say goodbye to the little girl tree.  
O Lord you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree.  
I rise up her girl-child lumps and slipping knots  
Into her laden boughs  
And amongst her roping limbs  
Like a swollen neck vein branching  
Into smaller lesser veins  
That must all just sing and say goodbye  
And let her blossom veils fly.  
Her velvet gown.  
Down down down.  
Down down down.  
Down down down and goodbye.  
For you know that I must say goodbye.  
To a rhythm softly tortured  
Of a motion back and forth.  
That's a rhythm sweetly tortured  
O that's the rhythm of the orchard.  
And you know that I must say goodbye  
To that little girl tree.  
O goodbye.  
Yes goodbye.  
For you know that I must die.  
Down down down.  
Down down down.  
Down down down and goodbye.  
For you know that I must die.  
Yes you know that I must die.  
O-o you know that I must die.

Once she lay open like a road  
Carbed apart the madness that I stumbled from  
But she fell away  
She fell away  
Shed me like a skin  
She fell away  
Left me holding everything  
Once the road lay open like a girl  
And we drank and laughed and threw the bottle over  
But she fell away  
She fell away  
I did not see the cracks form  
As I knelt to pray  
I did not see the crevice yawn, no  
Sometimes  
At night I feel the end it is at hand  
My pistol going crazy in my hand  
For she fell away  
O she fell away  
Walked me th the brink  
The fell away  
I did not see her fall  
To better days  
Sometimes I wonder was she ever there at all  
She fell away  
She fell away  
She fell away

I've been contemplating suicide,  
But it really doesn't suit my style.  
So I think I'll just act bored instead,  
And contain the blood I would've shed.  
  
She makes me feel so ill at ease,  
My heart is really on its knees.  
But I keep a poker face so well,  
That even mother couldn't tell.  
But my baby's so vain,  
She is almost a mirror.  
And the sound of her name,  
Sends a nervous shiver down my spine,  
Down my spine.  
  
I keep her photograph against my heart,  
For in my life she plays the starring part.  
Our love could hold off cigarettes,  
There's no room for cheap regrets.  
  
She makes me feel so ill at ease,  
My heart is really on its knees.  
But I keep a poker face so well,  
That even mother couldn't tell.  
But my baby's so vain,  
She is almost a mirror.  
And the sound of her name,  
Sends a nervous shiver down my spine,  
Down my spine.  
Down my spine,  
Down my spine,  
Down my spine.

White dress, torture in discuise, pointing flashlight right into my eyes,  
sharp pain every single night-, every day I fight a hopeless fight  
I look, over thirty years, I've wished that I was dead  
somebody help me out, because I'm tied down to my bed.  
  
I'm looking for someone to release me  
I'm waiting for an angel from my dreams  
I'm talking to all of you around me  
I'm asking you-tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
  
Dear god, gave me such a life  
full of pain, its sharp just like a knife  
I can think, but I cannot tell,  
Wots life to you, to me is hell  
I hear the storm outside-first drop just hit the roof  
id die to see the rain, but I can not, can not move.  
  
I'm looking for someone to release me  
I'm waiting for an angel from my dreams  
I'm talking to all of you around me  
I'm asking you-tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
  
If living is my cross, so let me die, or crucify me now,  
but tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
  
(musical interlude)  
  
Time stayes still, only I can feel when the darkness will apear  
everyday, I've wished away, oh please, please take away my pain,  
  
I'm looking for someone to release me  
I'm waiting for an angel from my dreams  
I'm talking to all of you around me  
I'm asking you-tell me can you hear my silent scream.  
Yea yea yea yea,

I stuck a six inch gold blade inside the head of a girl  
She: lying through her teeth  
Him: lying on his back  
Hands of this one,hands off she cried  
Grinning at me from hip to hip  
Hands off, pretty baby, tough blood then so soft to slip  
Ooohh yeah  
I stuck a six inch gold blade in the head of a girl  
Sharks fun slices suger-bed slices that pretty red-head  
I love you! now me! I love you!  
Laughter, laughter  
Oh baby, those skinny girls, they're so quick to murder  
Ooohhh yeah.  
Shake it baby, c'mon, shake, shake it baby

(Newbury, Folger)  
  
Yesterday the sun was shining but you're finding the sun it  
Don't shine all the time  
A winter day suddenly came your way  
And you ran into your mind  
  
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah  
Do you think you're ready for me?  
  
Oh and yesterday is gone forever and ever, never  
To be again  
You looked for the sunshine, that brought warmth to your mind  
But find only rain  
  
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah  
No, you're not ready for me  
  
But when yesterday becomes a memory, a memory  
That we uncovered in time  
If you still remember that cold September  
I reigned in your mind  
  
Sleeping Analeah, Weeping Analeah  
Then you'd be ready for me

Something's gotten hold of my heart  
Keeping my soul and my senses apart  
Something's gotten into my life  
Cutting its way through my dreams like a knife  
You're turning me up and turning me down  
Making me smile and making me frown  
  
In a world that was small I once lived in a time  
There was peace with no trouble at all  
But then you came my way  
And a feeling unknown shook my heart  
Made me want you to stay  
All of my nights and all of my days  
  
I gotta tell you now  
Something's gotten hold of my hand  
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land  
Yeah something has invaded my nights  
Painting my sleep with a color so bright  
Changing the gray and changing the blue  
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you  
  
I've got to know if this is the real thing  
I've got to know what's making my heart sing  
You smile and I am lost for a lifetime  
Each minute spent with you is the right time  
Every hour, every day  
You touch me and my mind goes astray  
Baby, baby  
  
Something's gotten hold of my hand  
Dragging my soul to a beautiful land  
Yeah something has invaded my nights  
Painting my sleep with a color so bright  
Changing the gray and changing the blue  
Scarlet for me and scarlet for you

Have you heard how Sonny's burning  
Like some bright erotic star?  
And He lights up the proceedings  
And raises the temperature.  
Flame on! Flame on!  
  
  
Now I've seen to Sonny's burning  
Someday I think I'll cut him down  
But it can get so cold in here  
And he gives off such an evil heat.  
Flame on! Flame on!  
Hail my incubatic incubator.  
  
  
Now pay witness to Sonny's burning  
Warming the damp and rotten seed  
Warming the damp and rotten seed  
That blooms into the DEMON FLOWER  
Now both fire and flowers consume me.  
Flame on! Flame on!  
  
  
Evil heat is running through me  
Flame on! Flame on!  
Sonny's burning pits into me  
Flame on! Flame on!  
Sonny's burning holes into me  
Don't interrupt! Don't interrupt!  
Flame on! Flame on!

It was back in '32 when times were hard  
He had a colt. 45 and a deck of cards  
Stagger lee  
He wore rat-drawn shoes and an old stetson hat  
Had a '28 ford, had payments on that  
Stagger lee  
His woman threw him out in the ice and snow  
And told him, never ever come back no more  
Stagger lee  
So he walked through the rain and he walked through the  
Mud  
Till he came to a place called the bucket of blood  
Stagger lee  
He said mr motherfucker, you know who I am  
The barkeeper said, no, and I don't give a good  
Goddamn  
To stagger lee  
He said, well bartender, it's plain to see  
I'm that bad motherfucker called stagger lee  
Mr. Stagger lee  
Barkeep said, yeah, I've heard your name down the  
Way  
And I kick motherfucking asses like you every day  
Mr stagger lee  
Well those were the last words that the barkeep said  
'cause stag put four holes in his motherfucking head  
Just then in came a broad called nellie brown  
Was known to make more money than any bitch in town  
She struts across the bar, hitching up her skirt  
Over to stagger lee, she starts to flirt  
With stagger lee  
She saw the barkeep, said, o god, he can't be  
Dead!  
Stag said, well, just count the holes in the  
Motherfucker's head  
She said, you ain't look like you scored in quite a  
Time.  
Why not come to my pad? It won't cost you a dime  
Mr. Stagger lee  
But there's something I have to say before you  
Begin  
You'll have to be gone before my man billy dilly comes  
In,  
Mr. Stagger lee  
I'll stay here till billy comes in, till time comes  
To pass  
And furthermore I'll fuck billy in his motherfucking  
Ass  
Said stagger lee  
I'm a bad motherfucker, don't you know  
And I'll crawl over fifty good pussies just to get one  
Fat boy's asshole  
Said stagger lee  
Just then billy dilly rolls in and he says, you  
Must be  
That bad motherfucker called stagger lee  
Stagger lee  
Yeah, I'm stagger lee and you better get down on  
Your knees  
And suck my dick, because if you don't you're gonna be  
Dead  
Said stagger lee  
Billy dropped down and slobbered on his head  
And stag filled him full of lead  
Oh yeah.

The cops are hanging around the house  
The cars outside look like they've got the blues  
The moon don't know if it's day or night  
Everybody's creeping around with plastic covers on their shoes  
You're making coffee for everyone concerned  
Someone points to this and someone points to that  
Everyone is saying that you should lie down  
But you ain't having none of that  
And I say to the sleepy summer rain  
With a complete absence of pain  
You might think I'm crazy  
But I'm still in love with you  
  
Hide your eyes, hide your tears,  
Hide your face, my love  
Hide your ribbons, hide your bows  
Hide your coloured cotton gloves  
Hide your trinkets, hide your treasures  
Hide your neatly scissored locks  
Hide your memories, hide them all  
Stuff them in a cardboard box  
Or throw them into the street below  
Leave them to the wind and the rain and the snow  
For you might think I'm crazy  
But I'm still in love with you  
  
Call me up, baby, and I will answer your call  
Call me up but remember I am no use to you at all  
  
Now, you're standing at the top of the stairs  
One hand on the banister, a flower in your hair  
The other one resting on your hip  
Without a solitary care  
I fall to sleep in the summer rain  
With no single memory of pain  
And you might think I'm crazy  
But I'm still in love with you

Hey hey I am the stow-a-way

All the towers of ivory are crumbling  
And the swallows have sharpened their beaks  
This is the time of our great undoing  
This is the time that I'll come running  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
One more time  
  
The light in our window is fading  
The candle gutters on the ledge  
Well now sorrow, it comes a-stealing  
And I'll cry, girl, but I'll come a-running  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Once again  
  
Gone are the days of rainbows  
Gone are the nights of swinging from the stars  
For the sea will swallow up the mountains  
And the sky will throw thunder-bolts and sparks  
Straight at you  
But I'll come a-running  
Straight to you  
But I'll come a-running  
One more time  
  
Heaven has denied us its kingdom  
The saints are drunk howling at the moon  
The chariots of angels are colliding  
Well, I'll run, babe, but I'll come running  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
Straight to you  
For I am captured  
One more time

Sugar Sugar Sugar  
That man is bad  
The road he drives you down  
O sugar it's a drag  
  
That road it twists  
That road is crossed  
Its down that road  
A lot of little girls go lost  
  
Sugar Sugar Sugar  
Keep on driving on  
Until the City of right  
Becomes the City of wrong  
  
That stretch is long  
You'll sleep and slide  
That stretch will find you  
Gagged and tied  
  
The hunter lies  
In a lowly ditch  
His eyes they sting  
And his fingers twitch  
  
You'll be his queen for the night  
But the morning you'll wake  
With the Lords and high ladies  
Of the bottom of the lake  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
That man is wild  
And sugar, you know  
That you're merely a child  
  
He will laugh  
And hang your sheets to see  
The tokens of your virginity  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
Honey you're so sweet  
And beside you baby  
Nothing can complete  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
Honey your so sweet  
But beside you baby  
A bad man sleeps  
  
You better pray baby  
Pray baby, pray baby  
You better pray  
You better pray, baby  
Pray, baby, pray baby  
You better pray baby  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
That man is bad  
And that's the bottom baby  
Coming right up ahead  
  
You can smell his fear  
You can smell his love  
As he wipes his mouth  
On your altar cloth  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
Try to understand  
I'm an angel of God  
I'm your guardian  
  
He smells you innocence  
And like a dog he comes  
And like all the dogs he is  
I shut him down  
  
Sugar sugar sugar  
I can't explain  
Must I kill that cocksucker  
Everyday  
  
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby  
You better pray your daddy he ain't far away  
You better pray baby pray baby pray baby  
You better pray your daddy's come to take you away  
You better pray baby, pray baby, pray baby  
You better pray o tender prey baby tender prey  
You better pray tender pray baby tender prey

Sunday's got a slave  
Monday's got one too  
Sunday's got a slave  
Monday's got one too  
Our sufferings are countless  
Our pleasures are motley few  
Spend all day digging my grave  
Now go get Sunday's slave  
  
Tuesday sleeps in a stable  
Wednesday's in a chains  
Tuesday gathers up the crumbs under the table  
Wednesday dare not complain  
My heart has collapsed on the tracks of a run-a-way train  
Just whisper his name  
And here comes Sunday's slave  
  
The hands in the stable are willing and able to pay  
If you feel at a loss, man, just who is the boss-man  
Ask the blood of one of it's bad days  
For his nerve is to serve but the sevice is a mockery  
He insists that he piss in your fist  
But he still takes the money anyway  
The master's a bastard  
But don't tell Sunday's slave  
  
Thursday's angered the master  
O. K. So Friday's gonna pay  
Thursday's angered the master  
Yeah, so Friday's gonna pay  
One night on the rack and he's back saddling up Saturday  
You can only whisper his name  
But not on Sundays  
Never on Sundays  
O Not on Sunday's slave

Jazz  
Fire eating drag-queens dressed as society whores  
Crazy two timing bitches running round  
Ghetto blasting blasters, blasting magnificently  
Blossoms falling from the cherry trees  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
High buildings with crippled backs circle around my dreams  
I clutch at the greasy tails of my dreams  
White blossom falling from the cherry trees  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
Ten bottles standing in a row military style  
With hats pulled low over their brows  
A thousand wasted hours  
Skeletons entwined fucking and braying? Fields  
Blossoms falling from the cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
History repeating itself like a  
All the great cars of the world in one massive collision  
All the doctors swallowed up by one incompetence  
All the great theorists and teachers eaten alive...  
Religious extacy and a blossom falling from a cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
Blind fish being used as musical scales  
Sharks puffed for fish and whales  
I long to be by the sea where a blossom falls from a cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
Three forms, four forms, five forms, six forms,  
Seven forms, eight forms, nine forms,  
A blossom falling from the cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me  
  
As Einstein said about his theory  
I love, I love, I love, I love jazz  
It's in your heart, it's in your soul, it's in your mind  
The colour of death, sweet vanilla essence  
Richard Harris and Donald Pleasance  
And a cherry blossom falling from a cherry tree  
That's what jazz is to me

Nick performed this for the Italian film Mojo, along with Gallon Drunk and it
is available on a cd called Soho.  
  
Now it begins, now that you're gone  
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn  
Watching that clock till you return  
And lighting that torch and watching it burn  
  
Now it begins, day after day  
This is my life ticking away  
Waiting to hear footsteps that say:  
Love will appear and this time will stay  
  
Each time you go  
I try to pretend  
It's over at last  
This time the big hurt will end  
  
Now it begins, now that you're gone  
Needles and pins, twilight till dawn  
So if you don't come back again  
I wonder when, oh when will it end?  
The big hurt (repeat)

(T. Springfield, F. Farian)  
  
Say goodbye, my one true lover  
And we'll steal a lover's song  
How it breaks my heart to leave you  
Now the carnival has gone  
  
  
Oh my love, the dawn is breaking  
And my tears are falling rain  
For the carnival is over  
We may never meet again  
  
  
Like a drum my heart was beating  
And your kiss was sweet as wine  
But the joys of love are fleeting  
For Pierrot and Columbine  
  
  
Now the cloak of night is falling  
This will be our last goodbye  
Though the carnival is over  
I will love you till I die

And no-one saw the Carny go  
And the weeks flew by  
Until they moved on the show  
Leaving his caravan behind  
It was parked out on the south east ridge  
And as the company crossed the bridge  
With the first rain filling the bone-dry river bed  
It shone, just so, upon the edge  
Away, away we're sad to say  
  
Dog-boy, Atlas, Man-drake, the geeks, the hired hands  
There was not one among them that did not cast an eye behind  
In the hope that the Carny would return to his own kind  
  
The Carny left behind a horse so skin and bone that he'd named Sorrow  
And it was a shallow unmarked grave  
That that old nag was laid  
In the then parched meadow  
  
And it was the dwarves that were given the task of digging the ditch  
And laying the nag's carcass in the ground  
While boss Bellini, waved his smoking pistol 'round  
Saying ''The nag was dead meat''  
''We can't afford to carry dead weight''  
The whole company standing about  
Not making a sound  
And turning to the dwarves on the enclosured gate  
The boss says ''bury this lump of crow bait''  
  
And the rain came hammering down  
Everybody running for their wagons  
Tying all the canvas flaps down  
The mangy cats growling in their cages  
The bird-girl flapping and squawkening around  
The whole valley reeking of wet beast  
Wet beast and rotten, sodden hay  
Freak and brute creation all packed up and on their way  
  
The three dwarves peering through their wagon's hind  
Moses says to Noah ''We shoulda dugga deepa one''  
Their grissom faces like dying moons  
Still dirty from the digging done  
  
And Charlie the Atlas to the three said  
"I guess the Carny ain't gonna show"  
And they were silent for a spell  
Wishing they'd done a better job at burrying Sorrow  
  
And the company'd passed from the valley into higher ground  
The rain beat on the ridge and on the meadow and on the mound  
Until nothing was left, nothing left at all  
Except the body of Sorrow that rose in time  
To float upon the surface of the eaten soil  
  
And a murder of crows did circle 'round  
First one, then the others flapping blackly down  
  
And the Carny's van still sat upon the edge  
Tilting slowly as the firm ground turned to sludge  
  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
And the rain it hammered down  
  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
And no-one saw the Carny go  
I say its funny how things go

Inanimational items elude I, and  
In-an-emotional-motion I swallow my  
Motive of quicker location is slammed  
My dim chance of skipping this thick world is thin  
They call me Dim  
I am the Dim Locator  
Dim Locator  
Loco, lomo, loco, lomo l'wow, wow, wow  
(same as above)  
Intrigueinometry treads on my trail  
Entriggering traps for a gross gang of ghost types  
Who later are packed in a cast iron trunk  
These things have been known, to get out of their wraps  
Don't call me Dim  
I am the Dim locator  
Dim Locator  
Loco, lomo......  
Fog fished and filtered is filling my case book, of  
Friends who fall foul of my files trip and breakneck  
Are stacked in the woodshed for further good use  
There's some certain people who shouldn't start fires  
So call me Dim!  
I am the Dim Locator!  
Dim Locator!  
Don't call me Dim!

The good son walks into the field  
He is a tiller, he has a tiller's hands  
But down in his heart now  
He lays down his queer plans  
Against his brother and against his family  
Yet he worships his brother  
And he worships his mother  
But it's his father, he says, is an unfair man  
The good son  
The good son  
The good son  
  
The good son has sat and often wept  
Beneath a malign star by which he's kept  
And the night-time in which he's wrapped  
Speaks of good and speaks of evil  
And he calls to his mother  
And he calls to his father  
But they are deaf in the shadows  
Of his brother's truancy  
The good son  
The good son  
The good son  
The good son  
  
And he curses his mother  
And he curses his father  
And he curses his virtue like an unclean thing  
The good son  
The good son  
The good son  
  
One more man gone  
One more man gone  
One more man  
One more man gone  
One more man gone  
One more man

One more man gone

I set out on monday  
The night was cold and vast  
And my brother slept  
  
And though I left quite quietly  
My father raged and raged  
And my mother wept  
  
Now, my life was like a river  
All sucked into the ground  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord, the hammer came down  
  
Many miles did I roam  
Through the ice and through the snow  
My horse died on the seventh day  
  
I stumbled into a city  
Where the people tried to kill me  
And I ran in shame  
  
Then I came upon a river  
And I laid my saddle down  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord, the hammer came down  
It knocked me to the ground  
And I said, "Please, please  
Take me back to my home town"  
Lord, the hammer came down  
  
Now I've been made weak by visions  
Many visions did I see  
All through the night  
  
On the seventh hour an angel came  
With many snakes in all his hands  
And I fled in fright  
  
I pushed off into the river  
And the water came around  
And then the hammer came down  
Lord, the hammer came down  
And it did not make a sound  
And I said, "Please, please  
Take me back to my home ground"  
Lord, the hammer came down

They found mary bellows cuffed to the bed  
With a rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head  
O poor mary bellows  
She'd grown up hungry, she'd grown up poor  
She left her home in arkansas  
O poor mary bellows  
She wanted to see the deep blue sea  
She travelled across tennessee  
O poor mary bellows  
She met a man along the way  
He introduced himself as richard slade  
O poor mary bellows  
Poor mary thought that she might die  
When she saw the ocean for the first time  
O poor mary bellows  
She checked into a cheap little place  
Richard slade carried in her old suitcase  
O poor mary bellows  
I'm a good girl, sir, she said to him  
I couldn't possibly permit you in  
O poor mary bellows  
Slade tipped his hat and winked his eye  
And turned away without goodbye  
O poor mary bellows  
She sat on her bed and thought of home  
With the sea breeze whistling all alone  
O poor mary bellows  
In hope and loneliness she crossed the floor  
And undid the latch on the front door  
O poor mary bellows  
They found her the next day cuffed to the bed  
A rag in her mouth and a bullet in her head  
O poor mary bellows  
So mothers keep your girls at home  
Don't let them journey all alone  
Tell them this world is full of danger  
And to shun the company of strangers  
O poor mary bellows  
O poor mary bellows

It was the dirty end of winter  
Along the loom of the land  
When I walked with sweet sally  
Hand upon hand  
  
And the wind it bit bitter  
For a boy of no means  
With no shoes on his feet  
And a knife in his jeans  
  
Along the loom of the land  
The mission bells peeled  
From the tower at saint mary's  
Down to reprobate fields  
  
And I saw that the world  
Was all blessed and bright  
And sally breathed softly  
In the majestic night  
  
O baby please don't cry  
And try to keep  
Your little hand upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep  
  
The elms and the poplars  
Were turning their backs  
Past the rumbling station  
We followed the tracks  
  
We found an untrodden path  
And followed it down  
The moon in the sky  
Like a dislodged crown  
  
My hands they burned  
In the folds of her coat  
Breathing milky white air  
From deep in her throat  
  
O baby please don't cry  
And try to keep  
Your little head upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep  
  
I told sally in whispers  
I'll never bring you harm  
Her breast it was small  
And warm in my palm  
  
I told her the moon  
Was a magical thing  
That it shone gold in winter  
And silver in spring  
  
And we walked and walked  
Across the endless sands  
Just me and my sally  
Along the loom of the land  
  
O baby please don't cry  
And try to keep  
Your little head upon my shoulder  
Now go to sleep

It began when they come took me from my home  
And put me in Death Row,  
Of which I am nearly wholly innocent, you know.  
And I'll say it again  
I... am... not... afraid... to... die.  
  
I began to warm and chill  
To objects and their fields,  
A ragged cup, a twisted mop  
The face of Jesus in my soup  
Those sinister dinner meals  
The meal trolley's wicked wheels  
A hooked bone rising from my food  
All things either good or ungood.  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way I'm yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of truth.  
An eye for an eye  
A tooth for a tooth  
And anyway I told the truth  
And I'm not afraid to die.  
  
Interpret signs and catalogue  
A blackened tooth, a scarlet fog.  
The walls are bad. Black. Bottom kind.  
They are sick breath at my hind  
They are sick breath at my hind  
They are sick breath at my hind  
They are sick breath gathering at my hind  
  
I hear stories from the chamber  
How Christ was born into a manger  
And like some ragged stranger  
Died upon the cross  
And might I say it seems so fitting in it's way  
He was a carpenter by trade  
Or at least that's what I'm told  
  
Like my good hand I  
Tattooed E.V.I.L. across it's brother's fist  
That filthy five! They did nothing to challenge or resist.  
  
In Heaven His throne is made of gold  
The ark of his Testament is stowed  
A throne from which I'm told  
All history does unfold.  
Down here it's made of wood and wire  
And my body is on fire  
And God is never far away.  
  
Into the mercy seat I climb  
My head is shaved, my head is wired  
And like a moth that tries  
To enter the bright eye  
I go shuffling out of life  
Just to hide in death awhile  
And anyway I never lied.  
  
My kill-hand is called E.V.I.L.  
Wears a wedding band that's G.O.O.D.  
'Tis a long-suffering shackle  
Collaring all that rebel blood.  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way I'm yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of truth.  
An eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
And anyway I told the truth  
And I'm not afraid to die.  
  
And the mercy seat is burning  
And I think my head is glowing  
And in a way I'm hoping  
To be done with all this weighing up of truth.  
An eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
And I've got nothing left to lose  
And I'm not afraid to die.  
  
And the mercy seat is glowing  
And I think my head is smoking  
And in a way I'm hoping  
To be done with all this looks of disbelief.  
An eye for an eye  
And a tooth for a tooth  
And anyway there was no proof  
Nor a motive why.  
  
And the mercy seat is smoking  
And I think my head is melting  
And in a way I'm helping  
To be done with all this twisted of the truth.  
A lie for a lie  
And a truth for a truth  
And I've got nothing left to lose  
And I'm not afraid to die.  
  
And the mercy seat is melting  
And I think my blood is boiling  
And in a way I'm spoiling  
All the fun with all this truth and consequence.  
An eye for an eye  
And a truth for a truth  
And anyway I told the truth  
And I'm not afraid to die.  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way I'm yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of proof.  
A life for a life  
And a truth for a truth  
And anyway there was no proof  
But I'm not afraid to tell a lie.  
  
And the mercy seat is waiting  
And I think my head is burning  
And in a way I'm yearning  
To be done with all this measuring of truth.  
An eye for an eye  
And a truth for a truth  
And anyway I told the truth  
But I'm afraid I told a lie

The moon is in the gutter  
And the stars wash down the sink  
I am the king of the blues  
I scape the clay off my shoes  
And wade down the gutter and the moon  
The moon blinds my eye with opal cataracts  
As I cut through the saw-mills and the stacks,  
Leaping over the gully where I would one day take Lucy  
Then wash up my hands in the gully and the moon.  
Such a long way from home, just me and  
The moon is in the gutter  
All my plans are flushed down the drain  
I wander lonely as a cloud  
Over memories at her mound  
Then lie down in the bitter gutter moon.

Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Come loose your dogs upon me  
And let your hair hang down  
You are a little mystery to me  
Every time you come around  
  
We talk about it all night long  
We define our moral ground  
But when I crawl into your arms  
Everything comes tumbling down  
  
Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Your face has fallen sad now  
For you know the time is nigh  
When I must remove your wings  
And you, you must try to fly  
  
Come sail your ships around me  
And burn your bridges down  
We make a little history, baby  
Every time you come around  
  
Come loose your dogs upon me  
And let your hair hang down  
You are a little mystery to me  
Every time you come around

Guitar thug blew into town.  
His eyes like wheels spinnin' round.  
Jerkin-off at every sound.  
Layin' all his crosses down.  
O yeah.  
He got Six Strings.  
The Six Strings that drew blood.  
The bar is full of Holy-Joes.  
A Holy-hole-a-whole-aria.  
Around the neck of our consumptive rose  
Is the root of all his sorrows.  
O yeah.  
He got Six Strings.  
Six Strings that drew blood.  
A Holy-hole-a-whole-aria.  
Six Strings that drew blood.  
In the bathroom under cover.  
He turns on one tap to discover.  
He's smashed his teeth out on the other.  
Well he look in the mirror and say  
Don't fuck me brother.  
Cause I got Six Strings.  
Six Strings that drew blood.  
Numbin' the runt of reputation they call rat fame.  
Top-E as a tourniquet.  
A low tune whistles across his grave.  
Forever the master and the slave of his Six Strings.  
A Holy-hole-a-whole-aria.  
Six Strings that drew blood.
