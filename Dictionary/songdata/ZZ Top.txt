What, what, what you want? Hey  
My thing is a real fine thing  
It's a thing, it's a real fine thing  
It ain't broke, it don't need a fix

Got a Thunderbird take me all over town  
Got a transistor radio standin' on the mix

Is it you again outside  
Just banging on the front door?  
You say you had enough  
Now you're comin' back for more  
But that's alright  
I said that, "That's alright"  
I may not want to admit it  
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe  
Now I don't mind when you send money  
And bring your girlfriends with you  
But how could one be so thoughtless to try  
And handle less than two?  
But that's alright  
I said that, "That's alright, baby"  
I may not want to admit it  
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe, yea  
Now I'm tellin' everybody  
It seems too good to be true  
Sweet things can always get sweeter  
I know mine did, how about you?  
Yes, it's alright  
I said, "Yes it, yes it is, that's alright"  
I may not want to admit it  
I'm just a fool for your stockings I believe  
Admit it  

Crawlin' 'cross the floor at the Holiday Inn motel

When you're driving down the highway at night  
And you're feelin' that wild turkey's bite  
Don't give Johnny Walker a ride  
'Cause Jack Black is right by your side  
You might get taken to the jailhouse and find  
You've been arrested for driving while blind  
  
Now just the other night with nothin' to do  
We broke a case of proof 102  
And started itchin' for that wonderful feel  
Of rollin' in an automobile  
You could say we was out of our mind  
And let me tell you we were flyin' while blind  
  
Then they had us up against the wall  
Hey it's only blood grain alcohol  
And there ain't no cause for alarm  
We ain't out to do nobody no harm  
How could anyone be so unkind  
To arrest a man for drivin' while blind

Somebody breathin' down my neck  
While I'm tryin' to roll the bones  
I don't care I'll just float a check  
Cause I'm feelin' my gamblin' Jones  
Here come seven, gimme eleven come again  
Love to hideout where I am my own best friend  
  
There's crazy little Linda Lou  
With the long and lanky legs  
Nobody do it like Linda do  
At these backwoods lone star dregs  
Like I told you, head out FM 92  
Roll in slowly, you'll be safer if you do  
  
If you don't know what I'm talkin' about  
Let me ease your worried mind  
It's the place to go without a doubt  
But it's a little bit hard to find  
Back in the timber, once you're there  
You'll want to stay  
Get loose and limber anytime night or day  
Just remember, ask for the Avalon hideaway

I got to have you baby  
Don't you say that you don't care  
I got to have you baby

The party says that you ain't there

Deep in the South of Texas  
Not so long ago,  
There on a crowded island  
In the Gulf of Mexico  
  
It didn't take too much money,  
Man, but it sure was nice.

And everybody knows  
It was down at the Balinese.

She always dressed in red  
Wearing skintight pants, Lord, and how she could dance  
With a rag wrapped around her head.

It was down at the Balinese.

I know you want to be my bedroom thing,  
But you're much too young.  
You're the finest thing I've ever seen.  
You just want to have fun.  
  
I need someone who can scratch my back.  
I need someone who can carry my pack.  
I need someone to be with me at night.  
You're gonna make me feel alright.  
  
Don't you bother me with petty lines,  
I know you ran away from home.  
This might come to you as some surprise,  
I wish you'd leave me alone.  
  
I need someone to scratch my back.  
I need someone to carry my pack.  
I need someone to be with me at night.  
You're gonna make me feel alright.

It's a chemical attraction I just can't slide by  
Every time I look into my baby's eyes  
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I surrender  
  
There's a visual attraction and she's branded my soul  
Simply can't deny she has control  
I'm helpless, so helpless, so I remember  
  
She won't let me breakaway  
She won't let me breakaway  
I said break away, ah yeah

And I'm not lyin' bout the pain  
  
She won't let me breakaway

It's easy to do when you feel the roll.  
Makes you want to get up, makes you want to move your feet.  
No matter how it's done you know it can't be beat.

They sure been stalking me 'round.  
So down tonight I couldn't tie my shoes.

The blues have just been certified.  
  
If I could shake loose I would feel so fine.  
There's one thing for sure and it's on my mind.

When you get up in the morning and the light is hurt your head  
The first thing you do when you get up out of bed  
Is hit that streets a-runnin' and try to beat the masses  
And go get yourself some cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
Spied a little thing and I followed her all night  
In a funky fine levis and her sweater's kind of tight  
She had a west coast strut that was as sweet as molases  
But what really knocked me out was her cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
(solo)  
  
Now go out and get yourself some big black frames  
With the glass so dark thay won't even know your name  
And the choice is up to you cause they come in two classes:  
Rhinestone shades or cheap sunglasses  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah

Strange things goin' through my head. Oh!  
Crazy things that I think she said.  
Slides so slinky that it's gotta be real.

Cherry red, cherry red  
She just want to feel cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
She just want to feel cherry red.  
This town of killer tits is doing me in.  
Tried to leave once want to do it again.  
But this one little thing's such a thoroughbred.  
I'm addicted to the feel of her cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
Addicted to the feel of her cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
I want to keep thinkin' 'bout cherry red.  
Whip out a bottle of your favorite rave

Ain't nothin' stupid what we're talking about  
Take a little twist and then you pour it on out  
Cherry red, cherry red  
Think you better tend to your cherry red.  
Cherry red, cherry red  
I think you better give me that cherry red.

In a flat Forty-One with my strat on the door  
We was goin' to the country for what we came for.  
I'm sure you've smelled the trees in the air.  
The best of motor cruisin's just the joy to get there.  
  
I was approachin' Simonton down by the cotton gin.  
There was old man Berkman trying to flag me in.  
He asked if I would stay awhile and if I needed gas.  
I said, "No thanks, anyhow I don't drive too fast."  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah,  
Ride my Chevrolet.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah,  
Ride my Chevrolet.  
  
I took the road down to Cinco  
Through that red Brazos River land,  
Done hit that freeway at sunset.  
Now the big city lights are at hand.  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah,  
Ride my Chevrolet.  
Hallelujah, hallelujah,  
Ride my Chevrolet.

Hard and cold, like a street of gold,  
It's easy to find but so hard to hold.  
Smooth and strong but it won't last long,  
When the rust sets in, she'll be good as gone!  
  
Concrete, Concrete and steel.  
It's like concrete.  
Hey baby, what's the deal?  
  
A heart of stone make you feel alone,

before you fall for her boy, you better think twice.  
  
Concrete, Concrete and steel.  
It's like concrete.  
Hey baby, what's the deal?  
  
Dark as night, diamond bright,  
Never seen such a strange delight.  
Slick as glass, and just as fast,  
You'll feel the pain, but it won't last.

QUE LASTIMA  
Why nosotros los pobres borrachos [And we the poor drunks]  
Nadie nos quiere coger [No one wants to have sex with us]  
Nuestro corazon no es tan malo [Our heart isn't so bad]  
Pero no tenemos mujer [But we don't have a woman]  
Que lastima, que lastima, que lastima [What a pity...]  
Que lastima, que lastima, que lastima  
Nosotros tenemos cervezas [We have beers]  
Tambien tenemos tiempo [We also have time]  
Importante tener pocos pesos [It's important to have a few pesos]  
Pero mi suerte es mala siempre [But my luck is always bad]  
Que lastima, que lastima, que lastima [What a pity...]  
Que lastima, que lastima, que lastima

Que lastima, que lastima, que lastime

Si senor!  
  
  
  

When the deal goin' down and you gonna take your chance  
There's always just a mystery that locks you in a trance  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know the deal is goin' down  
When the deal go down and the noose is bein' tied  
ain't no gettin' round it, fade back and let it lie  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know the deal is goin' down  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know  
No matter what the future brings you're booked, and lawd you're bound  
Be steppin' softly when you know the deal is goin' down  
Goin' down  
Down, down  
I'm going down

She's so fine, makes me lose my mind,  
I wish to apply my manhood.  
I'll be glad to go to her pad and  
Maybe the whole band could.  
  
I got to make a decision  
To avoid a collision.  
  
She's so tuff, my knee's a little rough  
From crawlin' on across her floor.  
If she'd place an order I'd drink her bath water and  
Not even use a chaser.  
  
I got to make a decision  
To avoid a collision.  
  
Her lips are wet and I'd make a bet  
She's been suckin' on her watermellon rind.  
She's a picture of wealth and I know myself  
That I'd take what she leaves behind.

I went down to dock number ten  
To see what just came in.  
They seemed a little bit mysterious,  
I think I'm gonna get delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS  
  
I got nailed in a raid last night,  
They tried to haul me off to jail.  
Things were looking kind of serious  
Till everybody got delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS  
  
I fell into a hand of cards  
And almost blew the night away.  
Things were looking kind of furious  
Till everybody got delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS  
  
I overloaded and I saw the light,  
Decadence was on my mind.  
Everything was getting ridiculous  
Till everybody get delirious.  
DELIRIOUS DELIRIOUS

Hey baby, watcha gonna do?  
Now that I've left you and I said we're through  
All along you been runnin' round  
But you ain't the only game in town  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
You're history and this is why  
You're just a dog a scurvy dog  
  
Hey baby, when we got it on  
You made me feel like there ain't nothin' wrong  
Just don't bug me like you're so naive  
I'm crackin' up, I'm gonna take my leave  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
You're history and this is why  
You're just a dog  
  
Hey baby well it's over now,  
I'll make my exit and I'll take a bow  
Your problem's cured with a dollar bill  
And if it won't I know a flea collar will  
  
I dug your brush and your ass was fine  
I dug your jelly and your mighty mind  
But you rubbed it on another guy  
You're history and this is why  
You're just a dog a scurvy dog.  
Arf! arf!  
  
Hey! Get that dog out of my yard!

I got shot through a space not long ago,  
I thought I knew the place so well.  
It wasn't the same, now it goes to show,  
Sometime you never can tell.  
  
I'm lookin' high and low, don't know where to go,  
I got to double back, my friend.  
The only way to find, what I left behind  
I got to double back again, double back again.  
  
You know I'm movin on in this fine machine,  
Rollin' on through the night.  
Seein' things like I've never seen  
And it's taking me outta sight.  
  
Lookin' high and low, don't know where to go,  
I got to double back, my friend.  
The only way to find, what I left behind  
I got to double back again, double back again.  
  
It's got me up and down,  
I been lost and found,  
Down in a deep dark hole.  
Looks like my luck has changed,  
I been rearranged  
And I'm coming out on a roll.  
  
Lookin' high and low, don't know where to go,  
I got to double back, my friend.  
The only way to find, what I left behind  
I got to double back again, double back again.

When I woke up this mornin'  
Had a smile run across my face.  
My baby from town just had to get down,  
Come and drag me all over the place.  
  
Gonta drive on a flatbed trailer truck  
Down on highway fifty-nine.  
I had the blues and my baby, she knew  
She's holdin' little piece of mind.  
  
Down brownie,  
My brownie downtown,  
Down brownie.  
  
Got my share and I'm a black hand cottonfield  
Just to try and keep myself alive.  
Eatin' red beans and rice with the right sauce, it's nice  
Or anything you want to try.  
  
Now I'm hitchin' a ride back from Brownie's,  
I'm kind of sad but I feel alright.  
The cold night it stings but I got me some wings,  
I'll be flyin' into Houston tonight.

I'm gonna get up in the morning  
I believe I'll dust my broom.  
I'm gonna get up in the morning  
I believe I'll dust my broom.  
Well my best gal I'll be leaving  
So my friend, get out my room  
  
I'm gonna write a letter to China  
See if my baby's over there.  
I'm gonna write a letter to China  
See if my baby's over there.  
If she ain't up in the Hawaiian Islands,  
Must be in Ethiopia somewhere  
  
I believe believe my time ain't long.  
I believe believe my time ain't long.  
I've had to quit my baby and give up my happy home.

Oh I'm makin' my way back home  
Least that's what I told her on the phone  
Been a while since I made her smile  
And I know she gonna dig my style  
Could you enjoy baby  
Really enjoy gettin' it on  
  
Could I get some pie ala mode  
When I come in off the road  
Do she still have her fightin' gear  
Just one look is gonna make it clear  
If she would enjoy baby  
Really enjoyed gettin' it on  
  
How does it feel holdin' me again  
She's holdin' on like it gonna never end  
Well I'm home thinkin' I should stay  
While I'm here just let me hear you say  
Say you enjoyed baby  
Really enjoyed gettin' it on

Esther be the one that shoots a machine gun  
Whether you like it or not.  
Midnight or daylight, stay out of her sight  
'Cause I heard she's one heck of a shot.  
  
Esther be the one, she's the only one.  
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.  
  
And you will feel her love bullets when you look her in the eyes.  
There ain't no way to escape.  
And that's when her fever will materialize,  
But it ain't no unfortunate fate.  
  
Esther be the one, she's the only one.  
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.  
  
It ain't nothing, but it's something so dear  
Don't get branded, cause her ammo is real  
  
If she gets you in a corner, don't let her mess you 'round  
And don't let her blow you away.  
If you can't dig on Esther, you turn and leave town  
'cause if you think she's bad you ought to see her sister.  
  
Esther be the one, but she's not the only one.  
She'll get you with her gun when the wolf starts howlin' at the moon.

Call me a pretty boy, they call me a saint  
They call me a sinner, well it's gonna be the same  
'Cause I'm not afraid, and I'm not a-feared  
I ain't gonna lose it, and I'm not scared  
  
To do the fearless boogie, and do the fearless boogie  
Smokin' fearless boogie until it's gone  
  
They call me a Pontiac, the red in my neck  
Well they call me a Cadillac - they call me a wreck  
I'm not afraid,and I'm not scared  
I ain't gonna lose it, and I'm not a-feared  
  
To do the fearless boogie, and do the fearless boogie  
Smokin' fearless boogie until it's gone  
  
They call me a lover  
They call me a fool  
They call me a winner  
The call me a mule

Smokin' fearless boogie until it's gone

It's all about the fearless boogie  
  
Good God good God almighty  
Good God good God almighty  
Good God good God almighty

Finest thing you ever seen  
And I love her, she's all that I want  
And I need her, she's all that I need

And I need her, she's all that I need

Some girls gotta get coco chanel  
Some get the luck of the draw  
I got a girl lookin' naturally well  
Hippest chick you ever saw  
She like wearin' powder and paint  
Wheelin' in a big Seville  
She's big cheese with the maitre D's  
Down at the bar and grill  
Just a girl in a t-shirt  
Girl in a t-shirt  
Her reputation precedes her  
In every boutique around  
They get down on their knees to please her  
She's throwin' that money down  
Now don't get it wrong, please understand  
She's barely keepin' up with the rent  
But the finer labels and her car phone  
Keep her down to her very last cent  
Just a girl in a t-shirt  
Girl in a t-shirt  
Everybody digs her, everybody try  
Once you get past that femme fatale  
Everybody knows she's fine  
I had to get it and quit it and keep a cool head  
It took me a pass or two  
But her code's done cracked I want you to know  
She's my baby through and through  
Just a girl in a t-shirt  
Girl in a t-shirt

I bet the derby and I won by a nose,  
I bet Vegas and they took my clothes.  
I bet Monte Carlo I was showin' my stuff,  
I bet on you baby, now ain't that enough?  
  
You got to give it up,  
Give it up baby.  
Give it up.  
You got to give it up, baby, tell me where it's at.  
  
Well there's a few more things you should know about me,  
I trained trigger single-handedly.  
I invented see-through negligees,  
And I bought the flying saucer off the Presley estate.  
  
You got to give it up,  
You got to give it up baby.  
Give it up.  
You got to give it up, baby, tell me where it's at.  
  
I fell in love down in Mexico,  
Thunderbird wine's the only way to go.  
I been in love ten thousand times,  
All you got to do is remember my line.

I was on my way down to Mexico,  
There was trouble on the rise.  
It was nothing more than I'd left behind,  
Which was much to my surprise.  
I turned around and lit a cigarette  
Wiped the dust off of my boots.  
When up ahead I saw the crowd,  
I knew it was no use.  
  
It's been the same way for Oh so long,  
It looks like I'm singing the same old song.  
  
A fine and fancy man was he,  
Doing good things for the poor.  
Giving rides in his rocking Eighty-eight for free.  
They could not hope for more.  
When it came my turn he said to me,  
"Have I seen your face before?"  
I said, "Oh no, you must be wrong,  
I'm from a distant shore.  
  
So if you don't mind, I'll just move along  
But it looks like I'm singing the same old song."  
  
A Nineteen Forty movie star  
With a long forgotten name.  
She was a sexy mess in her pleated dress,  
Still hanging on to fame.  
With forgotten lines she missed her cue  
And left a glass of wine at home.  
She was singing the same song that I was.  
Could we both be wrong?  
  
So hand in hand we walked along,  
Each of us singing the same old song.

Just when I had the money to spend  
And I was always thinkin' it would never end  
Then the time came, to the end of the game  
Don't you know?  
  
And just when the sky got shiny and bright  
There never seemed to be an end of the light  
But then the clouds came, it started to rain  
Don't you know?  
  
Just when it was goin'  
Just when it was goin' so good  
Just when it...  
Just when it was goin' so good  
  
Just when the highway straightend out for a mile  
An' I was thinkin' I just cruise for a while  
A fork in the road brought a new episode  
Don't you know?  
  
Just when it,  
Just when it was goin' so good  
Just when it was goin'  
Just when it was goin' so good  
  
But baby don't you worry  
I said baby don't you cry  
We're gonna get it together  
And I know you're askin' why  
  
Just when it,  
Just when it was goin' so good  
Just when it was goin'  
Just when it was goin' so good

She likes wearin' lipstick, she likes French cuisine  
But she won't let me use my passion unless it's in a limousine.  
  
She got me under pressure,  
She got me under pressure.  
  
She likes the art museum, she don't like Pavlov's dog.  
She fun at the mind museum, she likes it in a London fog.  
She don't like other women, she likes whips and chains.  
She likes cocaine and filppin' out with great Danes.  
She's about all I can handle, it's too much for my brain.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.  
  
I'm gonna give her a message,  
Here's what I'm gonna say:  
"It's all over."  
She might get out a nightstick  
And hurt me real real bad  
By the roadside in a ditch.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.  
  
It's got me under pressure,  
It's got me under pressure.

I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad.  
I'm gonna find me a groovy little hippie pad.

In a Jeep with a German Shepherd by her side.  
I'm gonna find me a blonde-haired mama,  
With boots and a forty-four on her side.  
And if I ain't too hjigh or used up,  
I'll have her take me for a groovy little hippie ride.  
  
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day,  
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red.  
I'm gonna fix brown rice every day,  
And drink down a bottle of Midnight Red.  
That's all I need to get groovy,  
That's what all the little hippie said.

Blues-based tune a la John Lee Hooker  
  
What a shame, what a shame, what a shame

Gimme, gimme, gimme my sweet hairdresser

Do you remember  
Back in nineteen sixty-six?  
Country Jesus, hillbilly blues,  
That's where I learned my licks.  
Oh, from coast to coast and line to line  
In every county there,  
I'm talkin' 'bout that outlaw X  
Is cuttin' through the air.  
  
Anywhere, y'all,  
Everywhere, y'all,  
I heard it, I heard it,  
I heard it on the X.  
  
We can all thank Doctor be  
Who stepped across the line.  
With lots of watts he took control,  
The first one of its kind.  
So listen to your radio  
Most each and every night  
'cause if you don't I'm sure you won't  
Get to feeling right.  
  
Anywhere, y'all,  
Everywhere, y'all,  
I heard it, I heard it,  
I heard it on the X.

Surprised?  
Yes, it's me again  
I have just returned from the island of Chandelier  
What am I doing in town?  
Well, I'm glad you asked  
I'm just passing through in search of the ever elusive Thunderbird  
I got a job as a public relations man  
Passing out handbills on Austin Street  
Merely an effort to improve my financial situation  
And ward off a case of the D.T.'s  
So farewell, my darling  
Perhaps we'll meet again  
On some sin-infested street corner in Houston Texas  

I want your hi fi mama, won't you let me play it tonight  
I want your hi fi mama, won't you let me play it tonight  
I put the needle in the groove, baby while you douse the lights.  
  
I play it on your dresser, play it upside your wall  
I play it in your kitchen, even play it in your hall  
I play it anywhere you want it, any old time at all.  
  
Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me.  
Hi fi lo fi no fi's just fine with me.  
And if you want to give me stereo first give me vitamin E.  
I got your name and your number.

Sometimes it's hard to make things clear  
Or know when to face the truth  
And I know that the moment is here  
I'll open my heart and show you inside  
My love has no pride  
  
I feel with you I've got nothing to hide  
So open your eyes and see who I am  
And not who you want for me to be  
I am only myself, myself  
  
I don't wanna lose you now  
We're gonna get through somehow  
I don't wanna lose you now or ever  
  
Baby I've finally found  
The Courage to stand my ground  
But if you want me  
I'll be around, forever  
  
We all make mistakes, we all lose our way  
But we stood the test of time and I hope  
That's the way it will stay  
It's all up to you, to tell me to go  
'Cause it won't be me to walk away  
When you're all that I know  
And I know that  
  
I don't wanna lose you now  
We're gonna get through somehow  
I don't wanna lose you now or ever and ever  
Baby I've finally found  
The courage to stand my ground  
  
But if you want me  
I'll be around, forever, forever, yeah , yeah  
  
Don't wanna lose you , lose you now  
We're gonna get through somehow  
Don't wanna lose you now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you

I'm picking up on a signal  
That's in the air tonight.  
It's sparkin' my receiver,  
It feels like dynamite.  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you.  
  
My mind is electric,  
I'm about to blow a fuse.  
The cockpit is empty  
So shoot it down the tube.  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you.  
  
I've got to make a connection.  
I'm on needles and pins.  
Workin' up a printout  
And I'm gonna zero in.  
I got the message  
But I want to get it straight from you.

Living room, passing time, talking trash, sipping wine,  
I need something more substantial.  
New deck of playing cards, I don't like to work this hard,  
I think I'll have to cancel.  
  
I'm running out of time,  
I'm about to lose my mind.  
I got the six,  
gimme your nine.  
  
Slow hand on the clock, I'm sitting here like a rock,  
I'm feeling so abnormal.  
Pictures in the magazines, all my thoughts are so obscene.  
Cover up that centerfold.  
  
I'm running out of time,  
I'm about to lose my mind.  
I got the six,  
gimme your nine.  
  
Look at this, what a pair, she won't let me touch her there,  
she's so discriminating.  
This is weird, it's time to blow, I just heard the rooster crow.  
I guess I'll have to spank my monkey.  
  
I'm running out of time,  
I'm about to lose my mind.  
I got the six,  
gimme your nine.

It's three o'clock in the morning  
And the rain begin to fall  
But I know what I'm needin  
But I don't have it all.  
I'm needin someone like you  
That I just want to do love to.  
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.  
  
Outside my window  
It's lonely and cold.  
Inside my heart there's a fire  
Burning out of control.  
Burning for someone like you  
I just want to do love to.  
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.  
  
Your love's coming to me  
Like a wolf howling at the moon  
But that just doesn't do me  
If I can't get you soon.  
I'm calling for someone like you  
That I just want to do love to.  
Baby, baby, I need you tonight.

You didn't have to love me like you did  
But you did, but you did.  
And I thank you.  
You didn't have to love me like you did  
But you did, but you did.  
And I thank you.  
But you took your love to someone else  
I wouldn't know what it meant to be loved to death  
  
You made me feel like I've never felt  
Kisses so good I had to holler for help  
You didn't have to squeeze it but you did  
But you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
You didn't have to hold it but you did  
But you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
  
Every day was something new,  
You put on your bag and your fine to-do  
You got me trying new things too  
Just so I can keep up with you.  
  
You didn't have to shake it but you did  
But you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
You didn't have to make it like you did  
but you did but you did  
And I thank you.  
  
All my life I've been shortchanged  
Without your love baby it's a crying shame  
But now I know what the fellas talking about  
Hear me say that they been turned out  
I want to thank you  
I want to thank you  
I want to thank you  
Yes, I want to thank you

She is an American car,  
She isn't legal so she can't go far.  
She got her mind stuck up in second gear,  
Where she going ain't exactly clear.  
Baby please, baby please, I want to drive you home.  
  
Low mileage without a pink slip,  
Clean upholstery and it ain't been ripped.  
She stripped her gears only late last night,  
I don't think that thing was oiling right.  
Baby please, baby please, I want to drive you home.  
  
She shakes and shimmies all over the road,  
She's always happy when she carry a load.  
Another lonesome automobile,  
Something bout the way she makes me feel.  
Baby please, baby please, I want to drive you home.

Well I was rollin' down the road in some cold blue steel,  
I had a blues man in back, and a beautician at the wheel.  
We going downtown in the middle of the night  
We laughing and I'm jokin' and we feelin' alright.  
Oh I'm bad, I'm nationwide.  
Yes I'm bad, I'm nationwide.  
  
Easin' down the highway in a new Cadillac,  
I had a fine fox in front, I had three more in the back.  
They sportin' short dresses, wearin' spike-heel shoes,  
They smokin' Lucky Strikes, and wearing nylons too.  
'Cause we bad, we nationwide.  
Yeah we bad, we nationwide.  
  
Well I was movin' down the road in my V-8 Ford,  
I had a shine on my boots, I had my sideburns lowered.  
With my New York brim and my gold tooth displayed,  
Nobody give me trouble cause they know I got it made.  
I'm bad, I'm nationwide.  
Well I'm bad, bad, bad, bad, bad, I'm nationwide.

I'm gonna tell ya what it's all about  
Sweet thang's tryin' to put me out  
She gone and found herself another man  
She tryin' to let me down as fast as she can  
  
It's only love, it drives me crazy  
It's only love pretty baby  
Baby, what you tryin' to do  
  
Well after runnin' round a time or two  
I found out only the best will do  
Well it's your own fault for lettin' her go  
So maybe now you'll take it slow  
  
It's only love, it drives me crazy  
It's only love pretty baby  
Baby, what you tryin' to do  
  
Well, it's all over now but the cryin'  
I keep on payin' the price for my lyin'  
Don't let it get you down it ain't nothin' new  
You ain't the only one that it's happened to  
  
It's only love, it drives me crazy  
It's only love pretty baby  
Baby, what you tryin' to do

When the light comes and yu're feelin' down  
'Cause your baby's out there somewhere runnin' round.  
Don't start feeling blue and feeling lonely too,  
It's hard I know when that love ain't true.  
  
You just can't explain, but you know it's there,  
That empty feeling seems so unfair.  
What can you do when it's gone, it's gone,  
'Cause those lovin' feelings seem to hurt so long.  
  
So if you feel like cryin', go ahead and cry,  
A heartbreak will cool as time goes by.  
And it's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.  
It's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.  
  
Well you work so long every day and night,  
Tryin' every thing that seems so right.  
But when a love falls a heart must break,  
And it's so hard baby, it's so hard to take.

Jesus just left Chicago and he's bound for New Orleans.

Big white house on the hill.

If you believe like workin' hard all day,  
Just step in my shoes and take my pay.  
  
I was born my papa's son,  
When I hit the ground I was on the run.  
I had one glad hand and the other behind.  
You can have yours, just give me mine.  
When the hound dog barkin' in the black of the night,  
Stick my hand in my pocket, everything's all right.  
  
I just got paid today,  
Got me a pocket full of change.  
Said, black sheep, black, do you got some wool?

She's got legs, she knows how to use them.  
She never begs, she knows how to choose them.  
She's holdin' leg wonderin' how to feel them.  
Would you get behind them if you could only find them?  
She's my baby, she's my baby,  
Yeah, it's alright.  
  
She's got hair down to her fanny.  
She's kinda jet set, try undo her panties.

Everybody wants to see if she can use it.  
She's so fine, she's all mine,  
Girl, you got it right.  
  
She's got legs, she knows how to use them.  
She never begs, she knows how to choose them.  
She's got a dime all of the time,  
Stays out at night movin' through time.  
Oh, I want her, said, I got to have her,  
The girl is alright, she's alright.

She had a look in her eye that could make you melt,  
Made me feel better than I ever felt.  
But bless her heart, she couldn't stay,  
I begged her not to go away.  
She left my ex best friend out in old Tucson,  
Told me she was leavin' and would be rollin on.  
Now the days just pass on by,  
Losin' her is the reason why.  
Leila, Leila your mind will be flying high  
And everything will be alright.

And everything will be alright.

My baby did a low down dirty thang  
My baby turned my mind to mush  
She took my liquor and left me the can to crush  
My baby did a low down dirty thang  
She had the gangster lean lookin' a little flushed  
She took my liquor and left me the can to crush  
My baby did a low down dirty thang  
My baby turned my mind to mush  
She took my liquor and left me the can to crush  
My baby did that low down dirty thang  
My baby workin' gangster lean lookin' flush  
The bitch took my liquor and left me the motha can to crush  

I got the attitude  
And that's all I ever say  
Don't have to tell nobody  
How their tail ought to lay  
  
Had a sudden revelation  
The heights that I've sunken down to  
And I don't mind I can't find  
My way out of this witch's brew  
  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
I stumbled on the way around  
My own reality  
  
Gettin' right-tightly wound  
Past the pale of normality  
I like big loungin' every day  
On the iguana side of town  
  
The lizard love, it mighty deep  
Talkin' way underground  
  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
  
I be a reptile all day  
And it's so fine  
Ain't no other way  
Like a life minus mind  
  
I prefer reclinin'  
Beatin' that conga drum  
And waitin' for a three-point landin'  
On my sticky tongue  
  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
Livin' for the lizard life  
I'm livin with a lizard life

Loaded  
Gonna have a good time  
Loaded  
Gonna have a good, good time  
Don't you know that I want to get loaded  
  
Lit  
Brighter than my butane  
I said lit  
Hotter than my low-down thing  
Take me inside-out, 'til I'm gone insane  
Well, oh yeah, shellac  
  
Loaded, loaded, locomotive  
Loaded, loaded, disembodied  
Let's fry

Black Cadillac  
Aphrodesiac

Yeah, put me up  
  
Loaded, loaded, locomotive  
Loaded, loaded, don't you just know it  
Harpoon, loaded, well  
Like Bridgette Bardot  
Like a French high-roller

It must have been the way that she kissed me,  
Made me as weak as a lamb.  
Tastes so fine like french silk pie,  
Sweet as strawberry jam.  
It could have been the thing that she told me,  
When she threw her wrench at my monkey.  
  
Should of been a cool scene,  
Like honey on a ripped queen.  
I thought it was a day-dream,  
But it must have been a love thing.  
  
I smiled at the way that she told me,  
"I just can't turn you a-loose."  
She was a force majeure in her haute couture,  
I was howlin' at the moon.  
That's when I jumped out of her window,  
Before my monkey could cook her goose.  
  
Should of been a cool scene,  
Like honey on a ripped queen.  
I thought it was a day-dream,  
But it must have been a love thing.

WHO WOULD BELIEVE  
  
AFTER SUCH A LONG TIME  
  
I FOUND HER AGAIN  
  
AND THAT'S NOT JUST ANOTHER LINE  
  
A LAST MINUTE SCENE THEN ANOTHER

But I'll be back for you, Jack  
And I'll let the machine speak  
That's right

Have mercy, Miss Percy  
I done put the coon tune on this bet  
That's right  
That's right  
That's right  

High class Slim came floatin' in  
Down from the county line.  
Just gettin' right on Saturday night,  
Ridin' with some friends of mine.  
They invited me just to come and see  
Just what was on their minds  
And then I took my first long look  
At the Master of Sparks on high.  
  
In the back of Jimmy's Mack  
Stood a round steel cage  
Welded into shape by Slim,  
Made out of sucker gauge.  
How fine, they cried, now with you inside,  
Strapped in there safe and sound.  
I thought, my-o-my, how the sparks will fly  
If that thing ever hit the ground.  
  
Slim was so pleased when I had eased  
Into his trap of death.  
He had slammed the door but I said no more  
And I thought I'd breathed my last breath.  
We was out in the sticks down Highway Six  
And the crowd was just about right.  
The speed was too, so out I flew  
Like a stick of rollin' dynamite.  
  
When I hit the ground you could hear the sound  
And see the sparks a country mile.  
End over end I began to spin  
But the ball started runnin' wild.  
But it was too late as I met my fate  
And the ball started gettin' hot.  
But through the sparks and the flame I knew that the claim  
Of the Master of Sparks was gone.

I could have been a brain surgeon  
I could have been a pharmacist  
I gave a shot at radio revivalist  
With the bossman I have never been missed  
  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
What is my IQ?  
What is my intelligent quotient  
  
I could have built the Golden Gate Bridge  
Or Einstein's nemesis  
I could have been a derby jockey  
But it's all come down to this  
  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
What is my IQ?  
What is my intelligent quotiant  
  
I could have built Las Vegas  
I could have built a drum sized Rolls Royce  
I could have been President of the world  
Could have had Ali on the ropes  
  
Could have had Miss August  
Again  
Could have had Miss May  
Again  
Could have had Miss September  
Again  
But I waited till December  
  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
Me so stupid  
  
What is my IQ?  
What is my intelligent quotient?  
  
That's so wrong...

If you're down in Acuna and you ain't up to being alone  
don't spend all your money on just any honey that's grown.  
Go find the Mexican blackbird and send all your troubles back home.  
  
They all call her her "puta" 'cause no one really knows her name.  
She works the cantina, dancin' and a-lovin's her trade.  
Her mama was Mez'can and her daddy was the ace of spades.  
  
Oh, let's drive that old Chrysler down to Mexico, boy.  
Said, keep your hands on the wheel there.  
Oh, it sure is fine, ain't it?  
Now, ya got it! Hand me another one of them brews from back there.  
Oh, this is gonna be so good.  
  
Mm, she's hot as a pepper but smooth as a Mexican brew.  
So head for the border and put in an order or two.  
The wings of the blackbird will spread like an eagle for you.  
  
Oh, one more time,  
can you roll me another Bull Durham, please?  
Can't you do it with one hand, boy?

I'm shufflin' through the Texas sand,  
but my head's in Mississippi.  
I'm shufflin' through the Texas sand,  
but my head's in Mississippi.  
The blues has got a hold of me.  
I believe I'm gettin' dizzy.  
  
Help me now  
  
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis,  
Lord, I thought I was in Heaven.  
I keep thinkin' 'bout that night in Memphis,  
I thought I was in Heaven.  
But I was stumblin' through the parking lot  
of an invisible seven eleven.  
  
What was I doin out there?  
  
Where's my head baby?  
Somewhere in Mississippi.  
  
Last night I saw a cowgirl.  
She was floatin' across the ceiling.  
And last night I saw a naked cowgirl.  
She was floatin' across the ceiling.  
She was mumblin to some howlin' wolf  
about some voodoo healin'.  
  
Mmm Baby

No keyboards, just Pearly Gates and a lot of sound pedals.  
  
I have to go to my parole-boy  
To remember just who I am  
One thing else I don't enjoy is  
Forgetting her monogram  
She electrifies my physical mass  
She really turns me on  
  
[Chorus]  
My mind is gone  
My mind is gone  
  
She quite simply wrecks me  
She just tears me apart  
She screws me up and skewers me  
She made it quite an art  
She guts me like a hollow-point  
She really turns me on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, Billy  
I know what you mean  
  
It's the smell of the dress  
That made my mind a mess  
It's her chokin' throat  
Really gets my goat-tee and amen  
Yes, indeed  
She makes my head and heart bleed  
Been so long since I knocked some off  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Tell me about it

Well, I knocked down on your door, baby,  
To see if you were at home.  
Your shade was down, there wasn't even a sound  
But something told me you weren't alone.  
What in the world can a nasty dog do  
But try to get next to you?  
  
Don't laugh 'cause it ain't funny.  
Look how it happened to me.  
It could happen to you, you could be a fool too  
And it'd leave you in misery.  
I guess there's nothin' more funky king can do  
But to try to get next to you.  
  
Mm, well.

Words and music by Billy Gibbons.  
  
Neighbor, neighbor, why you messin' in my life?  
Neighbor, neighbor, you've been talkin' to my wife,  
tellin' her you seen me  
runnin' wild the other night,  
runnin' wild the other night.  
  
A neighbor, neighbor, there's's always one in every crowd.  
A neighbor, neighbor, tellin' lies and talkin' loud.  
You better watch your step now.  
You might fall off your cloud.  
you might fall off your cloud.  
  
Now I was walking down a dusty road  
when along came a neighbor of mine.  
He saw me walkin' with my head hung down,  
he just had to stop and pass the time.  
Neighbor, neighbor, floatin' in the salty brine.  
floatin' in the salty brine.

Old man sleeping the hot day away,  
While he dreams a thousand yesterdays.  
'Cause he's had so many come his way.  
All he cares about is somewhere to lay his head tomorrow.  
  
Old man sits and thinks about his home.  
Doesn't matter 'cause he's all alone.  
What he'd give to get back on his own.  
Curses his body 'cause it's old and it gives no transportation.  
He sits in his one room shack alone but it provides no consolation.  
  
What a shame,  
His time is nearing.  
His eyes won't let him see  
The skies are clearing.  
Someone tells him  
Without his hearing.  
It's no news to those who've been around  
While things are changing.

A chili wind is blowing  
And I'm all covered up  
With despair and desperation  
And it just won't let me up  
It's come in time to face the truth  
And somehow I got to find the strength to move  
I gotta get up and get over you  
  
Another dawn it breaking  
And the people pass me by  
And they don't know how hard I'm making  
And there ain't no place to hide  
I've got to find some resistance, forgetting your existence  
I've got to get up and get over you  
If I could have one more chance  
With you by my side  
You know I would take back that moment  
When we said goodbye ooh yeah  
  
A chili wind is still blowing  
And the sun it going down  
And the streets are all in tears  
And there not a soul around  
It's coming time to face the truth  
And it's so hard to say I I gotta to do  
Somehow I got to get up and get over you  
Ooh man ooh hey get over you hey get over you  
I gotta get over you I gotta get over you oh

I've gotten good at missin' her  
I practice all the time  
While I drive the Pan Am highway through  
With that cactus friend of mine  
It's gettin' hard to see the white line rollin' by  
I can't forget her memory deep inside  
  
I dropped a bundle down in Panama  
But the loss didn't do me no good  
Spendin' cash and talkin' trash  
Don't do it like it should  
I realized I just couldn't buy her smile  
I'll keep tryin' on that Pan Am mile by mile  
  
If she'd meet me in San Salvador  
I'd buy her a drink or two  
We'd talk about our used to be  
And ride on to Peru  
The time to get it right is here and now  
If she won't I'll move on anyhow

I found an empty house in my neighborhood,  
I knew that wer shouldn't but I thought we could.  
Knew it wouldn't be hard to slide into the backyard,  
Called all my friends and slipped a hundred to the guard.  
We turned on the radio and had a party on the patio.  
  
Betty's in the sauna and she's getting kind of hot,  
Mary's in the icebox wishin' she was not.  
Connie's in the whirlpool, Jimmy's tryin' to be cool,  
Libby's in the bushes 'cause she's nobody's fool.  
We turned the lights down low and had a party on the patio.  
  
Heard the cops are coming so we tried to jump the fence,  
Mary didn't make it and we haven't seen her since.  
Connie had another drink, Jimmy simply couldn't think,  
Billy G. was passed out underneath the sink.  
But everybody's gonna show for another party on the patio.

I was out on the coastline  
Getting a little shake  
Do it every day  
For mercy sake  
Sometime surf's up  
Sometimes it's flat  
Eatin' up asphalt  
Prowlin' like a tomcat  
Stunned at what I see  
Should I stay or should I leave?  
Too much, not enough P-C-H  
Too much, not enough P-C-H  
Feelin' kind of free  
By the deep blue sea  
A true blood blue sud  
Hangin' on me  
Want to head north  
But I might go south  
Can't make up my mind  
'Cause I'm thinking like Brian  
I'm hangin' in and out  
I'm pullin' up 'cause it's about  
Too much, not enough P-C-H  
Too much, not enough P-C-H

She's really upset with me again,  
I didn't give her what she likes.  
I don't know what to tell her,  
Don't know what to say.  
Everything got funky last night.  
  
She was really bombed,  
And I was really blown away,  
Until I asked her what she wanted,  
And this is what she had to say:  
A pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
  
She gets a charge out of bein' so weird,  
Digs gettin' downright strange.  
But I can keep a handle on anything,  
Just this side of deranged.  
  
She was gettin' bombed,  
And I was gettin' blown away,  
And she held it in her hand  
And this is what she had to say:  
A pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
  
She is so tough, as pure as the driven slush.  
And that's not true what she's talkin' about,  
It really don't cost that much.  
  
She was gettin' bombed,  
And I was gettin' blown away,  
And she took it in her hand,  
And this is what she had to say:  
A pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.  
She wanna pearl necklace.

What you lookin' at, girl?  
  
She's always checkin' with her penthouse eyes,  
Makes me stutter, gives me butterflies.  
Got to have her, she pins me up with her penthouse eyes.  
  
I want to lie where her eagle flies,  
She's got my love pressure on the rise.  
When I see her, she really rocks me with her penthouse eyes.  
  
Don't need excuse for graspin',  
Can't blame the boy for askin'.  
One look sting you like a honey bee,  
But it's her eyes gonna set you free.  
  
I want to stretch her out in old Levi's,  
Got to have a little piece of paradise.  
I got to have her, she pins me up with her penthouse eyes.  
  
Don't need excuse for graspin',  
Can't blame the boy for askin'.  
There's no escape let me tell you no lie,  
She's always lookin' with her penthouse eyes.

Piece  
I want a little piece

I been stuck, so I asked her why  
She gave me acupuncture as her alibi  
Shook my soul, and stole my dough  
Left my condition down a deep dark hole  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she ask  
I get nailed every now and then  
I get my mojo working but I'm pinned again  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she asks  
I'm gettin' pricked around and punctureated  
I let my ya ya down, I got penetrated  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she asks  
I'm a pincushion, gotta face the facts  
Just a pincushion, do everything she asks

What can I do, I'm a nervous wreck?  
There's girls everywhere, I better go and check. CHECK IT OUT  
I can't tell a diamond from a hole in the ground.  
They all got my head spinning round and round.  
Planet of women, oh yeah.  
The planet of women, oh yeah.  
It's driving me insane.  
  
They start by acting just a little discreet.  
Then they're in the skies and they're in the streets.  
You can find them in cars or a hotel lobby,  
they're easy to find, just look for a body.  
Planet of women, oh yeah.  
Just a planet of women, oh yeah.  
It's driving me insane.  
  
If you have the answer, drop me a line today  
or send a straight jacket something in a shade of gray.  
I think I've sprained my brain 'cause it won't unwind.  
Every day it's man against man on the  
planet of women, oh yeah.  
Just a planet of women, oh yeah.  
It's driving me insane,  
it's driving me insane.

Gotta have a prettyhead, said pretty, prettyhead

So you stayed in my house for about a year  
Ate my food and you drank my beer  
You took my money, kept asking for more  
When you disappeared, didn't close the door, baby  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
Then you came around and I bought you a brand new car  
I said, I loved you, didn't get me very far  
Then another round of give me that and give me this  
Then boom, you were gone, I got the total dis'  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
So wrong  
Wuzzup? Wuzzup?  
So wrong

It's your punk ass boyfriend  
Clouding up the issue  
It's that punk boyfriend  
I just want to kiss you  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  
It's your punk ass boyfriend  

According to Gibbons, this stands for "mean rhythm" and indicates  
the album's general mood. 'Straight from Bo Diddley Land'.  
  
Solid-silver beat machine  
Hunkin' down  
Funkin' up on Magazine  
On rhythmeen in New Orleans  
  
Drinkin' Dixie 45 with hot links  
In a silver Continental  
Wired as hell and doin' things  
That's what you get on rhythmeen  
  
Oh yeah, way up  
Oh yeah, way out  
Uh-huh, get on up  
Rhythmeen is down  
Rhythmeen thing  
Mean mean rhythmeen  
  
Can't get enough of that special sauce  
The backbeat's the big boss  
Here comes another dope fiend  
Tradin' up for rhythmeen  
  
Oh yeah, weird up  
Oh yeah, fear not  
Uh-huh, get on up  
Rhythmeen is down  
  
Leanin' on a silver Lincoln  
A Galaxy 500  
In a Mustang might Tchoupitoulas  
Rhythmeen up everything

What in the world's come all over me?  
I ain't got a chance of one in three.  
Ain't got no rap, ain't got no line  
But if you'll give me just a minute I'll be feelin' fine.  
  
I am the one who can fade the heat,  
The one they all zzay just can't be beat.  
I'll shoot it to you straight and look you in the eye.  
So gimme just a minute and I'll tell you why  
I'm a rough boy, I'm a rough boy.  
  
I don't care how you look at me  
Because I'm the one and you will see  
We can make it work, we can make it by.  
So give me one more minute and I'll tell you why  
I'm a rough boy, I'm a rough boy.

Clean shirt, new shoes  
And I don't know where I am goin' to.  
Silk suit, black tie,  
I don't need a reason why.  
They come runnin' just as fast as they can  
Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man.  
  
Gold watch, diamond ring,  
I ain't missin' not a single thing.  
And cufflinks, stick pin,  
When I step out I'm gonna do you in.  
They come runnin' just as fast as they can  
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man.  
  
Top coat, top hat,  
And I don't worry coz my wallet's fat.  
Black shades, white gloves,  
Lookin' sharp lookin' for love.  
They come runnin' just as fast as they can  
'Cause every girl crazy 'bout a sharp dressed man.

She don't love me, she love my automobile.  
She don't love me, she love my automobile.  
Well she would do anything just to slide behind the wheel.  
She said what's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?  
She said what's it gonna take for you to lay your top on down?  
I said honey why don't you ask me when we get to the outskirts of town.  
  
Well now she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk.  
Well she don't care if I'm stoned or sloppy drunk,  
Long as she got the keys and there's a spare wheel in her trunk.

She used to drive a beat up pickup  
Down around San Antone  
Stealin' the heart of every guy in town  
Includin' the one I own  
But this sweet young thing of seventeen  
Would sting you with the lovesick blues  
Just a blonde haired blue eyed picture of sin  
Lookin' for someone to use  
She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider  
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago  
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker  
But she can break a heart and take all the love she needs  
Ooh well I heard she got down in beaumont  
And she wound up in El Paso  
She was tuff as a boot and thin as a rail  
And she could step to the cotton eyed joe  
If you run across this flagrant fuzzy  
I slip in and I get her while you can  
'Cause far too long she'll be good as gone  
And runnin' with another man  
She's a lover 'n fighter, she's a wild bull rider  
And I'm wonderin' why she left me such a long time ago  
And she's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker  
She can break a heart and take all the love she needs  
She's a heartbreaker, she's a love taker  
Well she can break a heart and take all the love she needs  

Also released on the From Dusk Till Dawn soundtrack.  
  
Everything about her was natural  
Everything about her was cool  
But I'm a little partial for beautiful girls  
Even if they blood runs blue  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
I think I love her  
She's just killing me  
I think she's killing me  
  
Her castanets are enormous  
Her bongo beat absolute  
And when she doin' midnite performances  
She's got a secret somethin' to boot  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
Oh, I think I love her  
But she's just killing me  
I think she's killing me  
  
Miss Satanic Pandemonia  
Don't get any lower or slower  
What you see is what you get conmigo  
And the bonus of an albino boa  
  
I think I see her  
I think I want her  
Yes, I think I love her  
She's just killing me  
She's just killing me  
(That's some time I had)  
  
I think I see her  
I know I love her  
Yes, I might love her  
She's just killing me  
She want to be killing me  
(Suck my blood)

I met a shiek from Mozambique  
Who led me to the Congo.  
He dreamed to go to Mexico  
And sample a burrito.  
  
My temperature had risen again,  
It must have been a hundred and ten.  
  
Under the oaks I was telling some jokes  
And thinkin' I had it made-  
Gettin' on with the folks, havin' some Coke  
And coolin' off in the shade.  
  
My temperature had risen again,  
And it must have been a hundred and ten.  
  
I took a boat that couldn't float  
To Rio de Janeiro.  
So with my scuba I swam to Cuba  
But I'll be gone tomorrow.  
  
My temperature had risen again,  
It must have been a hundred and ten.

When it's cold outside and you want to sleep in  
go for a pallet that's so nice and thin.  
Zip it on around while it's on the ground,  
spread it out and lay it on down.  
Slip inside my sleeping bag,  
slip inside my sleeping bag.  
  
You're afraid of the dark, baby, no need to be shy.  
We'll talk about some lovin' while we look at the sky.  
Don't be hesitating, it'll be alright,  
we'll tuck it in until it's clean out of sight.  
Slip inside my sleeping bag,  
slip inside my sleeping bag.  
  
Let's go out to Egypt 'cause it's in the plan,  
sleep beside the pharoahs in the shifting sand.  
We'll look at some pyramids and check out some heads.  
Oh, we'll whip out our mattress 'cause there ain't no beds.  
Slip inside my sleeping bag,  
slip inside my sleeping bag.  
  
  
  
  
  
  

I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
Do you want to play?  
I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
I said whatcha' say!  
The water she is nice we can steal away  
They'll never know we're gone 'til the break 'o day  
Come on! Come on!  
  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Did they talk to you today?  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Did you see it their way?  
The moon she is high, we must leave tonite  
We must get away, we will join the fight  
Come on! Come on!  
  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie!  
Did our brothers stay  
I say Hey Snappy Kakkie  
Will our sisters pay  
Does it really matter of the friends we lost  
It doesn't really matter cause their souls were lost  
Come on! Come on!  
  
I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
Do you want to play?  
I say Hey! Snappy Kakkie!  
I say Hey! watcha' say!  
The water she is nice we can steal away  
They'll never know we're gone til the break 'o day  
So come on!

Woman, grab your children, run and hide.  
Don't let it catch up with you.  
You gotta fight it to stay alive,  
And if it gets you, man, you're through.  
  
It smells so rotten and rank.  
Well, everybody calls it the squank.  
  
It's sick, depressing, getting bigger all the time.  
Don't help it any way you can.  
It's grey and brown and sometimes lime  
And it's spreading all over the land.  
  
And soon we'll be all breathing out of tanks  
If something ain't done about the squank.  
  
The meanest thing the world's ever bred  
By me and you and my kin fold too.  
A monster can't live unless it's fed,  
And it's being fed by me and you.  
And soon it's gonna leave the world blank,  
And we'll all be erased by the squank.

It's a fine time to fall in love with you,  
I ain't got a single thing to do.  
It happened before I knew what was going on.  
I fell out and knew that I was gone.  
Stages keep on changing,  
stages rearranging love.  
  
Then you left me standing all alone,  
I couldn't even get you on the phone.  
Were you just confused and didn't know  
if you should stay or if you had to go?  
Stages keep on changing,  
stages rearranging love.  
  
Now you're back and say you're gonna stay.  
I wouldn't have it any other way.  
Tell me it's for real and let me know  
why does lovin' have to come and go.  
Stages keep on changing,  
stages rearranging love.  
  

Rain fell this mornin', make me feel so bad  
On account of my baby walked off with another man.  
Like takin' eyesight from the blind man and money from the poor  
That woman took my lovin' and walked on out that door.  
And it sure got cold after the rain fell,  
Not from the sky, from my eye.  
  
Somebody, can you tell me just what make a man feel this way?  
Like river without its water, like night without a day.  
And it sure 'nuff got cold after the rain fell,  
Not from the sky but from my eye.  
  
If you're home early in the mornin' you hear that rain to fall,  
With thunderbolts and lightning the wind begins to call.  
Your worry's superficial 'cause you slept on through the night  
But stormy weather keep you wond'rin' if ev'rything's all right.  
And it sure 'nuff got cold after the rain fell,  
Not from the sky but from my eye,  
Not from the sky, from my eye.

I gotta find out what's in my mind,  
I'm a little mixed up but it feels so fine.  
Why does love have to come and go,  
If it's got to leave why does it go so slow?  
  
Just tell it  
Tell it like it is.  
Tell it  
Tell it like it feels.  
Tell it to my baby.  
  
I have a feelin' that I'm goin' insane,  
I've fallen in love but can't remember her name.  
She probably stepped out and she's coming back again,  
but if I don't know her how can I let her in?  
  
Just tell it  
Tell it like it is.  
Tell it  
Tell it like it feels.  
Tell it to my baby.  
  
Fine!  
So fine!)  
  
How could this ever have happened this way?  
Well, sometimes love turns out that way.  
Sometimes it's cold and sometimes it's hot,  
But it's better to have it than to need it and not!

TV dinners there's nothin' else to eat  
TV dinners they really can't be beat  
I like 'em frozen but you understand  
I throw 'em in and wave 'em and I'm a brand new man oh yeah!

Something crossed my mind again and you were in my eyes  
It was somewhere I've already been  
Tellin' all those lies  
But I've been there and you've been there and there ain't no mistake  
We could take it anyway  
But there one thing you can say  
There's just two ways to play  
Just two ways to play  
I don't want to stay  
There's just two ways to play and I want to play it right this time  
  
There's always the easy numbers there's those hard ways too  
there's those cheaters numbers  
Its either one of two  
But fortune tellin's mesmerizin' and the game of chance  
Rollin' dice ain't sympathizin' when you play romance  
There's just two ways to play  
Just two ways to play  
I don't want to stay  
There's just two ways to play

I can't control my inner thunder it makes me wander round for days  
  
Two ways to play  
There's just two ways to play

There's just two ways to play, I'm gonna play it right this time

Between sundown and up  
There's an off-the-wall cantina, man  
Just waitin' to tear you up

And out con nalgas fried

Y'all still want me to come with you?  
Bright light city gonna set my soul, gonna set my soul on fire  
There's a whole lot of money that's ready to burn  
So get those stakes up higher.  
There's a thousand pretty women just a-waiting out there,  
And they're all livin' devil-may-care.  
I'm just the devil with a love to spare.  
  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
  
Ah, thank-ya very much baby.  
And how I wish that there were more  
Than twenty-four hours in the day.  
But even if there were forty more,  
I wouldn't sleep a minute away.  
Oh, there's blackjack and poker and a roulette wheel.  
A fortune won and lost on every deal.  
All you need's a strong heart and a nerve of steel.  
  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
  
Viva Las Vegas with your neon flashin',  
And your one-armed bandits crashin'  
All those hopes down the drain.  
Viva Las Vegas turnin' day into nighttime,  
Turn the night into daytime,  
If you see it once, you'll never come home again.  
I'm gonna keep on the run,  
I'm gonna have me some fun,  
If it costs me my very last dime.  
  
If I wind up broke,  
Then I'll always remember that I had a swingin' time.  
I'm gonna give it everything I've got.  
Lady Luck please let the dice stay hot.  
Let me shoot a seven with every shot.  
  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva Las Vegas.  
Viva, Viva.

Draggin' old Mustang '69  
Top dropped back an' lookin' fine  
Workin' the groove, backin' up with Scotch  
Lookin' like Sir Lancelot  
What it is, brother?  
What it is, kid?  
Rock it like a mother  
What it is?  
Lookin' to sway by the evenin' shade  
But I ain't ready to behave  
An' that ain't bad on the other hand  
Detroit rocks like the Rio Grande  
What it is, brother?  
What it is, kid?  
Rock it like a mother  
What it is?  
What it is? What it is?  
What it is? What it is?  
What it is? What it is?  

What would you do if you was to love me?  
What would you do if I loved you too?  
I knew that I'd fall like a sinner  
I'd rather fall in a sinner than fall in lose  
What would you do if you was to kill me?  
What would you do if I killed you too?  
I knew that I'd fall like a sinner  
I'd rather fall in sin than fall in lose  
Sometimes someone gets down and out  
Sometimes someone gets love divine  
What would I do if you was to fuck me?  
What would you do if I fuck you too?  
I know that I fuck like a sinner  
I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue  
I know that I'd fuck you 'til you're blue  

Well how much blues do you use  
Before you use it up  
And how many fools take a chance  
Before they hit it lucky  
Tomorrow's want to be the day  
It never seem to work that way  
  
[Chorus]  
What's up with that  
What's up with that  
What's up with that  
What's up with that  
  
Everybody want a little more  
Than they think they got  
But what you might think it is,  
Might really not be, baby  
Pick it up or leave it lay  
It always seem to slip away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now how high will a river get  
Before it overflows  
And how long is the hole to China  
It don't really know  
This is what it's all about  
There's always gonna be a doubt  
  
[Chorus]

I'm so tired, you on my head.  
Whiskey'n mama, you shouldn't have said  
You wanted me to be your lover true,  
Then turn around and treats me just likes you do.  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.  
  
Now I could be right and could be wrong,  
You been layin' out all night long.  
You telephoned this mornin', said you'd be home soon.  
The doorman said he seen you at the Club Blue Lagoon.  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.  
  
Whiskey'n mama, you standin' there  
With your curly hair  
Just to have you do me good.  
I know you could if you only would.  
  
Whiskey'n mama, you standin' there  
With your curly hair  
Just to have you do me good.  
I know you could if you only would.  
  
Well, the sun come shinin' on the rain soaked street.  
Whiskey'n mama, where can she be?  
I guess I'll have to put you down on my list,  
I didn't want to do it but you insist.  
I should have known better than to fool with a whiskey'n mama.

When I woke up this morning  
I was feeling mighty good.  
My baby understood had to do what she should  
Lying near a pile of wood.  
Laying it on some,  
Playing with it some  
When I, I woke up with wood.  
  
I was lying there thinking 'bout basketball  
Trying not to lose my mind  
My baby came to help and I let out a yell,  
She grabbed me from behind.  
Laying on it some,  
Playing with it some  
When I, I woke up with wood.  
  
Beauty queens fall in trances,  
Debutantes lose their furs.  
But it felt so good from where they stood,  
They were working on a pile of wood.  
Laying on it some,  
Playing with it some  
When I, I woke up with wood.

I hit the street running, had an angle in mind  
Looking for a shelter, doing double overtime  
I get a little crazy, but I won't be denied  
Gotta find the time that takes the inside outside  
  
Tumbling, in a world of swirl  
Rumbling, in a world of swirl  
In a world of swirl  
Everything's hazy, everything's a blur  
  
Isn't it amazing? checking outta where we were  
It's so unpredictable, at the end of my rope  
Gotta skate the ledge outta this kaleidoscope  
Tumbling, in a world of swirl  
  
Rumbling, in a world of swirl  
In a world of swirl  
In this cloud of dust, you've got to keep steady  
Hang on you must, you better get ready  
  
Over the ledge, ripping the curl  
Riding the edge off into to twirl  
Tumbling, in a world of swirl  
Rumbling, in a world of swirl  
  
In a world of swirl
