He would step out of the night and light a fire among his tribe  
Carving from a bear's tooth, he used the flesh to feed the youth  
He'd salt it down...  
  
Sails were made from darkened hide, fish were caught in the lowest tide  
Thought of war kept him strong, he listened for the battle song  
In the night...  
  
And the old would teach the young to heed the word of the master's tongue  
A chosen son would take a bride and light the fire among his tribe  
And on and on...

Got an awesome sound goin' down  
Got an awesome sound goin' down  
Got an awesome sound goin' down  
Got a pork roll egg cheese and bacon  
  
Stop the tape here  
  
Got an awesome sound goin' down  
Got an awesome sound goin' down  
Got some, got some awesome sounds goin' down  
  
Alright. Lay it on me!  
  
Awesome sound goin' down  
Got an awesome sound goin' down  
Got an awesome sound goin' down  
Got a pork roll egg cheese and bacon  
  
Oh. Oh yeah. Baby. Hit me again! Stop it  
Hit me again! Oh yeah. Hit me again! Stop it. Hit me again!  
Oh! Oh! Hit me again! Hit me again! Oh!  
  
Got an awesome sound, it's goin' down  
Got this awesome sound, it's really goin' down  
Got this really fuckin' awesome sound  
  
Hit me! Hit me! Hit me again! Oh! Oh! Hit me!  
One more time!  
  
Oh, awesome sound goin' down  
Awesome sound goin' down  
One more time! Hit me! Oh stop it! Hit me!

Reaching out now and I touch your face  
Please believe I'm only traveling  
Like seeking wonder from a foreign place  
It matters not from where I'm coming  
  
And the snow so light is bleeding  
We sleep so tight when we're breathing  
Calm a little pint of soul - creeping  
  
Calm the light, let me fly, back to Basom (call is waiting, contemplate a
thread already spun)  
Calm the light, let me fly, back to Basom (should you carry what you are is
cooked until it's done)  
  
Left to locate the last trace of waste  
I picked it up and it was smiling  
Just like the dancer who has lost her leg  
She laughs alone but then she's crying  
  
And the snow so light is bleeding  
We sleep so tight when we're breathing  
Calm a little pint of soul - creeping  
  
Calm the light, let me fly, back to Basom (call is waiting, contemplate a
thread already spun)  
Calm the light, let me fly, back to Basom (should you carry what you are is
cooked until it's done)

Looking up to the sky,  
Made me realize,  
Made me want to fly.  
  
To a place far away,  
Where they're singing songs,  
And making love all day.  
  
Somewhere beyond the sun,  
Where an atom splits,  
And an ounce is a ton.  
  
So don't you be late,  
I see the Beacon Light and it's on,  
So strap on that jammy pack,  
Fuel it up,  
Cause I'm gone.  
  
The people all dance,  
With their big long arms,  
And a peach in their pants.  
  
Picking fruit from the sky,  
As the demon ship,  
Goes passing them by.  
  
I don't know if it's love,  
But it's coming down,  
From the heaven's above.  
  
So don't you be late,  
I see the Beacon Light and it's on.  
So strap on that jammy pack,  
Fuel it up,  
Cause I'm gone.  
  
So don't you be late,  
I see the Beacon Light and it's on  
So strap on that jammy pack,  
Fuel it up,  
'Cause I'm gone

A child without an eye  
Made her mother cry  
Why ask why  
She kept her child clean  
On Buckingham Green  
  
The children saw the eye  
As a sign from God  
Descending from the sky  
It was alright to dream  
Of Buckingham Green  
  
Summon the queen  
Spoke the child of eye  
It's time to fly  
Turning fire to steam  
On Buckingham Green  
  
A child without an eye  
Made her mother cry  
Why ask why  
She kept her child clean  
On Buckingham Green

Is it alive, does it writhe  
Can it survive under the sun?  
I can't put my finger on it  
Is it green, is it red  
  
Is it alive or is it dead  
I can't put my finger on it  
Scathe with a lathe  
All the days in the past  
  
I can't put my finger on it  
Is it brown, is it white  
Is it really outta sight  
I can't put my finger on it  
  
Can it squeal, does it squirm  
If it's fresh will it burn?  
I can't put my finger on it  
Can it fly, will it try  
  
If the wings are still wet?  
I can't put my finger on it  
Can it heal, is it real  
Can it feel the threads of time?  
  
I can't put my finger on it  
Does it glow, will it shine  
Does it leave a trail of slime  
I can't put my finger on it

Please would you like to be somewhere floating free?  
Seems my destiny, Captain Fantasy  
Take a minute to go down beneath the reaches of sound  
You could be with me, Captain Fantasy

Couldn't taste the taste that I was tastin'  
Couldn't hear the waste that I was makin'  
Tired of the life I was facin'  
  
Couldn't tell one from another  
Couldn't hide a secret from my mother  
Any other mother wouldn't bother  
  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
  
Got me on the porch I'm in the front row  
Says "shit's for real man" like I don't know  
Get your punk ass back to the dog show  
  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
  
A new breath I feel the grip releasin'  
Scraping my guts off of the ceiling  
I've got that sunny bunny feeling  
  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Sail brown bay to chocolate town  
Makin' time breakin' ground  
Greyhound bus to chocolate town

Cold blows the wind over my true love  
Cold blows the drops of rain  
I never had but one true love  
And in Camville he was slain  
  
I'll do as much for my true love as any young girl may  
I'll sit and weep down by his grave for twelve month and one day  
  
But when twelve months were come and gone  
This young man he arose  
What makes you weep down by my grave  
I can't take my repose  
  
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips, one kiss is all I crave  
One kiss, one kiss of your lily white lips and return back to your grave  
  
My lips they are as cold as my clay  
My breath is heavy and strong  
If thou was to kiss my lily white lips  
Thy days would not be long  
  
Oh don't you remember the garden grove where we used to walk  
Pluck the finest flower of them all, twill wither to a stalk  
  
Go fetch me a nun from the dungeon deep  
And water from a stone  
And white milk from a maiden's breast,  
That babe ere never known  
  
Go dig me a grave both long, wide and deep as quickly as you may  
I'll lie down in it and take one sleep for twelve month and one day  
  
Cold blows the wind over my true love  
Cold blows the drops of rain  
I never had but one true love  
And in Camville he was slain  
  
I'll do as much for my true love as any young girl may  
I'll sit and weep down by his grave for twelve month and one day

The sky dripped in a demon sweat the night she left  
Wrapped up in a blanket and I'm feelin' wet  
They said she flew from the goals in her life  
Then she wet like blood from a knife  
I'm here, and it's all so clear now  
  
The wind flows and it's blowing cold, and I'm still here  
Gripping onto what's not around  
Now it's all so clear to me now  
Now I know, sometimes I try a bit too hard  
And I can't let go of you  
Boo-boop-dee-doo  
Boo-boo-boop-dee-doo  
Boop-dee-doo

I'd like to see you before I go  
There's a few things I'd like to do  
And when you're gone, you'll be gone for long  
And soon I'll be gone too  
  
But don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it, ooh  
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it  
  
Are you happy with the color of your tea  
Could you use some sugar now?  
You're satisfied with your boy or your girl  
Your little butter cup  
  
But don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it  
Don't sweat it, don't sweat it, don't sweat it.  
  
I'd like to see you before I go

Do you ever walk alone?  
Like a drifter in the dark  
Seeking out what isn't there  
Looking only for a spark  
  
From a girl who's all alone  
Maybe she's a-driftin' too  
Like a shadow in the night  
Waitin' just to meet with you  
  
And then perhaps in love you'll stay  
Or fall and go your separate ways  
Still searchin' for a spark  
Like a drifter in the dark  
  
[Repeat: x8]  
Doodn doo doo doodn doo (da da da da da)

I'm goin' crazy trying to keep you sane  
Takin' my prescriptions, forging my name  
I was happy this morning, ya finally got yourself dressed, eatin all the bacon  
Its okay i was still impressed  
  
I love you, even if you don't  
you've got your knife up to my throat, what do you want to see with me?  
  
Rooting though the garbage for treasures in the trash pile, seein my
expression will always make you smile  
Please don't touch my phone book, my friends are getting pissed off  
Ya wake em I'm the morning, I'm acting like a jerkoff  
  
I love you, even if you don't  
you've got your knife up to my throat, what do you want to see with me?

Ooh-yeah-yeah

Lets begin with the past in front and all the things that you really don't
care about now  
You'd be exactly where I'm at  
And to think you've got a grip well, look at yourself your lips are like two
flaps of fat  
They go front and back and flappidy flappidy flap  
  
I'm on stage its all an act, I'm really scared that I may fall back on the
abstract  
It'd be exactly where I'm at  
  
If you're to be  
The roaming eye well pry it open and let me tell you why it sees  
The harsh realities  
  
Lets begin with the past in front and all the things that you really don't
care about now  
You'd be exactly where I'm at

Fat Lenny's gonna walk right into myself  
Fat Lenny's gonna see myself (Reflect it back on myself)

Stop by my friend Fat Lenny, I like him a lot (Tell him about my buddy)  
He's Fat Lenny - what

Good dog Fluffy, old friend my pal  
Fluffy's got his buddy on the porch

Penny takes Fluffy for a walk out on the path  
Fluffy chases the other doggies on the path  
But big sister Penny get Fluffy back on the porch  
So me and Fluffy and Penny were on the porch

Wrap yourself up in gold,  
The fruits of the old,

I need whiskey to ease the pain  
But it's early in the mornin'  
And I'm feelin' bad again  
  
But if you ever loved me  
You'll go easy on me now  
Fix me up a cup of coffee  
And in a while I'll come around  
  
I think I spent the dog-food money  
But he'll love me just the same  
And if you really love me baby  
Help me scrape the mucus off my brain  
  
It's a shame when morning hurts

I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to go  
Oh, just so ya know  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
  
Days go by and I'm still high  
But you know I'm thinkin' about you  
Corn's turned brown, leaves fall to the ground  
It's a sound that reminds me of you  
  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to leave you on the farm  
I don't want to go  
Oh, just so ya know

Go get somethin', hey, thanks for nothin'  
I'll keep truckin' and gettin' myself stoned

Days go by and I'm still high  
But you know I'm thinkin' about you  
Corn's turned brown, leaves fall to the ground  
It's a sound that sticks like glue

Did we miss the moon?  
I'd lie in your arms if I could  
Such a common pain  
Repeats itself again and again  
  
Flowers grow in the springtime and leaves fall from the trees  
I've been GONE for so long, you just threw away the keys  
I understand it, but I don't want it  
  
I know it so well, you tripped me and I laughed when you fell  
This isn't how it should be  
I've let you drift so far, from me  
  
But please hold onto the memories  
Before we really crash and burn  
We've got ourselves so wrapped up that we've forgotten how to learn  
I understand it, but I don't want it

Talkin' to some Joe,  
Hangin' out, shootin' shit  
Tries to tell me somethin'  
I play it off legit  
  
How did you handle it?  
I played it off legit  
  
So pleasant when the sails of the seas of Orion gently slip  
No more need for God's sorrow  
I just play it off legit  
  
Dude's hounding this bitch, okay  
I'm checkin' out the shit laughin' (yeah)  
Later on I'll fuck her (oh man)  
She knows I'm legit  
(She does? I didn't know that)  
(That's right, from the start)  
(Bitch was houndin' and shit)  
(Tell me about that sexy scorpion)  
A sexy scorpion that stings her with wit  
I play it off legit because I know I'm legit  
(That's right, I know you're legit)  
(I'm legit, played it off cool)  
  
My ma bought me a cool shirt  
When I wear it, I'm the shit  
I'm really not that legit  
My mom bought it  
(She wasn't playing it off legit either)  
(Nah, she knows I'm legit)  
(Did you clap when you saw her?)  
I clapped when I saw her  
When I found her, you split  
When I'm on the go, you know I'm legit

You want to hear about the scorpion?

I heard my brother weepin' in the dead of the night  
I said, "Dude, man, you feelin' alright"  
Gener said nothin' and continued to weep  
I caught Papa Gene Ween cryin' in his sleep  
  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
  
(You fucked it up again!)  
  
Life at the top can be tough  
Sometimes you think you've seen enough  
But you can find a diamond in the rough  
But when it's time for bed, you shouldn't think about that stuff  
  
Yeah, I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
I tried to wake him up but he made not a peep  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep  
  
I saw Gener cryin' in his sleep

It could rain for a thousand days  
Or something I don't know  
Look to the sun and we're having fun  
Beside the river flow  
You're doing this and you're doing that  
Workin' all the time  
Tonight you'll call me on the phone  
You've got a worried mind  
  
And when you leave  
You'll go away  
Gone to stay  
Don't feel so bad  
It was nice what we had  
You'll be glad  
  
I'll miss you  
There's a moon and it's bright tonight  
The sun has gone away  
Stop the sweat and I'll feel alright  
You know I like it this way  
You're packin' stuff for your big, big move  
In just a couple of days  
You'll be off on you're big, big cruise  
Across the USA  
  
And when you leave  
You'll go away  
Gone to stay  
Don't feel so bad  
It was nice what we had  
You'll be glad  
  
I'll miss you  
I'll miss you  
I'll miss you

Are my lemons tied? Is my hair in place?  
Have I got a cute expression on my face?  
Are my shoes all shined?  
I try to keep in line when I'm dancing in the show tonight  
  
Does my shuffle step really look so good?  
Am I doing it the way you think I should?  
Would it be amiss if I blew a kiss  
When I'm dancing in the show tonight?  
  
Showtime now is getting nearer and I'm getting scared  
Wish I could see in the mirror if I'm all prepared  
  
First you take a step then you point your toe  
Hope I know it like I did a week ago  
Am I standing straight?  
I can hardly wait till I'm dancing in the show tonight

I'm flyin' (flyin')  
In a frame of my mind that time cannot erase  
I'm seein' (seein')  
The future, the past as I lay the present to waste  
I'm scopin' (scopin')  
All these feelings I have and hopin' for them to come true  
And I'm holdin' something more precious than fine ore, baby

Looking for someone like you

How would you feel, if I took you away  
To a place I know, a place where we could stay  
Called Joppa Road, a pretty place I know  
Where we can go, called Joppa Road  
  
The things I feel on Joppa Road  
Can make me stay, and make me go  
This old road where I long to go  
Called Joppa Road, where we can go  
  
Put your best dress on, there's a place I know  
Where we can go, called Joppa Road  
It's a little ways where the sun shines down  
Where we drive real slow, on Joppa Road  
  
Joppa Road, a pretty place I know  
Where we can go, called Joppa Road

King Billy  
Why don't you invite them up?  
I got a word or two to tell them  
It's about the situation  
A terrible miscommunication  
It involves a child of mine  
Destined to side with the oppression  
King Billy  
Let me speak to them  
But a bad wire burn the connection  
A man fix the problem  
It is the only solution  
King Billy  
I see them birds in flight  
Take off in every direction  
A thinking man, a feeling man  
I will not side with the oppression  
King Billy  
Why don't you invite them up?  
But aim them in the opposite direction  
A chance at love attraction  
A chance to heal the nation

These three little, these three little fuckers  
These three little, pumpkin patch  
These three little pumpkins went into the woods and they said  
  
They said today we're gonna find something really good to look at  
And they went into the woods and they looked at all the little trees  
And they said this woods is really continuous little trees  
You know, 'cause nature is just as part of us as we are to the earth  
  
I said yeah  
And the pumpkins, the pumpkins went further into the woods  
And they came across this little man with a big, big head  
And the little man said, "What's your fucking idea you fuckers?  
  
What are you fucking high?"  
And the little pumpkin says,  
"We're the pumpkins to join yours for a loose the pumpkin"  
"Oooey! Oooey! Oooey!  
  
You ain't been in my world  
You never been in my world  
You never will be in my world  
You go away and you'll never be in my world again"  
  
The pumpkin boy said, "Yes you will, yes you will, I think to stay  
I want to be in your world  
For you in your world"  
"Yeah you fuckers, you can't get me off before you leave yourself  
  
You think you can understand but you can't!  
Look, you just entered my world, right?  
You just entered my world and it's quite like you go in and for  
Then enjoy nothing but share and progress  
  
You think you can go from the top of the tree to the top of this too"  
  
The two pumpkins looked at the little man and they said,  
"Why, why would he be such a, why would he be such a jerk?  
And the only thing he does is smoke drugs,  
And he doesn't do cocaine,  
And he doesn't shoot smack,  
And he doesn't even drink beer  
Why would he be such a fucker to me?  
Why would he be such fuckers?"  
All they wanted to do was pumpkins  
All they wanted to laugh at was the pumpkins  
  
Go back! Get out of the woods! Get out of the woods!

The wind is howling and the time is right for fear  
In the emergence in the phosphorescent tears  
And all the hippies gonna lick the mind of God?

There's a sweater wearin', coat totin', boot footin'  
Good lookin' man on town  
There's a smooth-talkin', funny walkin' dude around  
There's a pretty girl and she sees him walkin'  
Looking him up and down  
She thinks she'd like to roll and rock him  
Turn his life around, turn his life around  
  
Turn his life around

Drift away on a puffy cloud  
Go away on a puffy cloud  
My brain is dead from too much pot  
'Cause Gene, Dean and I smoke too much pot  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Float away on a cotton ball  
We write songs about the clouds  
My brain is dead from too much pot  
'Cause Gene, Dean and I smoke too much pot  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Drift away on a puffy cloud  
Go away on a puffy cloud  
My brain is dead from too much pot  
'Cause Gene, Dean and I smoke too much pot  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  
Cloudy, cloudy, cloudy cloud  

It's a nine mile walk from the office to the pumps  
Sometimes you think you're gonna drop  
In the end you're filthy dirty, horny, and pissed off  
And before you can leave you gotta sweep the fuckin' shop  
  
It's a real real bitch to be workin' for the man  
But shit, I do it well, so what the fuck  
I could probably wash dishes at some other fuckin' dump  
But it's all the same to me, bustin' ass to make a buck  
  
So read 'em up and stick 'em  
Pump that fucker good  
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump  
Get your fingers outta your ass  
And pump some fagot's gas  
And think about how bad New Hope sucks  
  
And it's a piss poor life when the ladies fire you up  
And then you check their oil and know you're fucked  
'Cause no one wants a loser who works for 5 an hour  
Smells like gas, looks like shit, works in the rain and rude as hell  
  
Now I can fix a tire like Hurricane Melinda  
I know that I'm the best for what it's worth  
So if I choose to help you don't look like you expect it  
'Cause it's a gift that God gave me at birth  
  
So read 'em up and stick 'em  
Pump that fucker good  
Some woman down on Main Street needs a jump  
Get your fingers outta your ass  
And pump some fagot's gas  
And think about how bad New Hope sucks, woo hoo!

Take a piece of tinsel and put it on the tree  
Cut a slab of melon and pretend that you still love me  
Carve out a pumpkin and rely on your destiny  
Get in your car and cruise the land of the brave and the free  
  
But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells you that the roses are free  
  
Tke a wrinkled raisin, and do with it what you will  
Push it into third if you know you're gonna climb a hill  
Eat plenty of lasagna 'til you know that you've had your fill  
Resist all the urges that make you want to go out and kill  
  
But don't forget to understand exactly what you put on the tree  
Don't believe the florist when he tells you that the roses are free  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Throw that pumpkin at the tree  
Unless you think that pumpkin holds your destiny  
Cast it off into the sea, bake that pie and eat it with me

(Pork roll egg and cheese on a kaiser bun)  
  
I met her at the Living Earth Show  
She crossed the room, the lights sank low  
We're together, she really digs me she fucks me  
Who would think I could be so happy?  
When I'm cold, I know she's keepin' me warm  
We're together, she really digs me she fucks me  
  
She's in my arms, she's in my heart, yeah  
Pins and needles up and down my spine  
We're together, she really digs me now  
She fucks me, she fucks me

Three men is all they were.  
Three men out at sea.  
Three men came aboard my ship and took my true love from me.  
I couldn't believe  
She wanted to leave  
She wanted to leave.  
  
I loved you so long.  
Since you were a child.  
I've cared for your every need.  
I've tried to make you smile.  
And all the while  
You wanted to leave  
You wanted to leave.  
  
Go gather the guns.  
We'll blast them at sea.  
She begged for me not to shoot,  
"For my true love is here with me."  
I've never loved thee  
Now I must leave  
Now I must leave.  
  
So go fetch a bottle of rum dear friends and fill up my glass to the rim.  
For I'm not the man I used to be  
Now I'm one of them.

Ah she danced like a floozie in a hot tub of guava  
Achin' round the scene, you know she's hip to her mantra  
He was a meditated fucker all strung-out on Sinatra  
Hitting van Winkle like there ain't no tomorr-a  
  
I saw van Winkle show up on the scene  
I can't remember when I saw that's he's been doing all the  
Sketches of Winkle crying to the heavens in a fit of rage  
Sketches of Winkle keep little humans locked up in a cage  
Sketches of Winkle I think I love her but she don't love me  
Sketches of Winkle why don't you love me, girl?  
  
She drained all the fluid from the sink in the kitchen  
Achin' round these all she's doin' is bitchin'  
Steven said he went and bought a new pair of mittens  
Mean Ween cut me and he said he was kidding  
  
I saw van Winkle show up on the scene  
I can't remember when I saw that's he's been doing all the  
Sketches of Winkle crying to the heavens in a fit of rage  
Sketches of Winkle keep little humans locked up in a cage  
Sketches of Winkle I think I love her but she don't love me  
Sketches of Winkle why don't you love me, girl?  
  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle  
Rip van Winkle rip rip Rip van Winkle

State this ache as the final break  
Tender situation, create a good illusion  
Feel the grip of your salvation  
This is indeed a tender situation  
  
Make a move man, state your case  
Taste the waste man, taste the waste  
What is your place in my glorification  
Yeah, this is really a tender situation  
  
Get off the pot man, shake and bake  
Taste the waste boy, taste the waste  
Pump it up or stray from that old station  
Yeah dude this is really a tender situation  
  
Tender situation, tender situation, tender situation

Yesterday we lost our lives, tomorrow we were born  
Fortunes smiled upon us, sacrifice the Argus  
All that he might help us see  
  
Magna eyes that track for miles, looking for disease  
Puzzled by the mountains, tricked by the sea  
and the argus is practiced compassion  
with an eye on you, as one is on me  
will the god eye grant his forgiveness  
and allow he that's lived, a reason to see  
Counting days and building walls, bells ring so's to warn  
All the sings that guide us, chosen by the Argus  
Tell me has chosen you  
  
Led by form we shed our soul  
Trusting like a child  
See the dark face that saved us  
Drink from his empty eyes  
  
and the argus is practiced compassion  
with an eye on you, as one is on me  
will the god eye grant his forgiveness  
letting droplets of light erupt from the sea  
  
Lying in beds of garlic and orchid, he closes an eye, which closes another  
And in sleep he dreams, of watching and looking and feather clouds dancing  
He curls up his lid and sleeps  
  
Swirling with visions on man's confusion  
All of the work, done just to appease him  
The Argus he cries, though love has it's place in the sun  
It's only man's fear that carries him on

For hither not, I am the stallion.  
Come fear, come love, I am the stallion.  
You know that I am the stallion, mang.  
I am, I am the stallion, mang.  
You know that I am the stallion, mang.  
I live, I walk, I am the stallion, mang  
  
Hair-throng goo-tongue, stallion mang.  
A 2 S-T-A-L-L-I-O-N  
I am the stallion, mang.  
  
1: I can drink  
2: I get groomed  
3: I go for a walk  
I am the stallion, mang.  
You know that I am the stallion, mang  
  
Deaner! Deaner! Dude!  
Where can you be?  
Come hither.  
Who are you? The stallion.  
Deaner: What's goin' on?  
Who are you, Deaner?  
Deaner: I am, I am the stallion  
You are the stallion  
  
a-b-c-d-e-f-g-h-i-j-k-l-m-n-o-p-q-s-s-t-a-l-l-i-o-n  
I am the stallion, mang.  
I can feel what I like to see in you and me and the stallion.  
I can play, I get to take the water because I am the stallion.  
o-p-l-g-h-m-f-s-t-a-l-l-i-o-n  
  
Stallion, mang. Stallion, mang. Stallion, mang.  
I am the stallion.  
Wild stallion.  
Wild stallion.Goodbye  
Stallion.Stallion. Goodbye  
  
Stallion! Stallion! Stallion! Stallion! Stallion!  
  
Whenever forth to come hither, when I can see the wind,  
I shall too ride upon the stallion.  
I shall too lick the palm of the stallion,  
Whilst I drink the hair from the stallion. Mang.  
I am the stallion

Buddy, why's my brain so muddy  
Why do I feel like putty when she walks into the room?  
Touch my tooter, smoocher  
  
Sonny, it ain't all milk and honey  
And I don't think it's funny when she starts to groove  
  
Baby, ain't it pretty lazy, and ain't it crazy  
When you think it's all smooth  
Touch my tooter, smoocher  
  
Buddy, why's my brain so muddy  
Why do I feel like putty when she walks into the room?  
  
Sonny, ain't it funny?  
And I don't think it's funny when she starts to groove  
Touch my tooter, smoocher  
  
Take it down for me!  
Bring it on!  
Touch my tooter, smoocher!  
Ahhhh!  
  
Buddy, why's my brain so muddy  
Why do I feel like putty when she walks into the room?

Transdermal celebration  
Caused a slight mutation  
In the rift  
It toppled down a nation  
And left the people running for the hills  
But the mutants that I see  
Shine their beauty unto me  
I wish you could see them  
  
Tectonic tribulation  
Formed a crust of green beyond the reef  
Waves fell in formation  
Cause the plants to bend with spi-ked leaves  
I'm growing with the land  
Time has taken my hands and let me touch them  
  
Hey, hey,  
A billion miles to Mark A  
Lay on the lawn, he's already home  
When the morning ray hits his face  
  
Transdermal celebration  
Jets flew in formation  
I could see them  
Dropping the crustaceans  
Leaving trails of flames in their wake  
But where is the mutation  
Who once told me it was safe, I can't find him

At the dawn, I woke, I was alone, rising  
I called you on, the force, of time and space, calling  
And as she came, to me, I fell back down, realizing  
Oh that it's cool, for you, to love me now, I'm everything  
  
Everything, 'cause tried, and true, I see the light in you  
Oh han you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole, life?  
  
You bent the edge, eclipsed, and turned around, aligning  
And though the dark, sparked rays of violet light, blinding  
I went about, the job, of sowing thoughts, and feelings  
Oh some were good, some bad, I felt the cries, of healing  
  
'Cause tried and true, I see the light in you  
Oh can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole, life?  
  
Rise, my Dawn, you've been awake too long  
Let me rest in time, while I blow your mind  
  
At the dawn, I woke, I was alone, rising (I got ya)  
I called you on, the force, of time and space, calling (see them)  
And as she came, to me, I fell back down, realizing (creation)  
that it's cool, for you, to love me now, I'm everything (I am)  
  
Everything,'cause tried and true, I see the light in you  
Can you dig in my soul, could you smell my whole, life?

Voodoo Lady  
Shakin' that stick and drivin' me crazy  
Your eyes look red and hazy  
Doin' that stuff that you do  
Messin' me up with your voodoo  
  
You drive me crazy with that  
Boogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie oogie  
You drive me crazy with that  
Boogie boogie boogie  
  
Your lips are hot and spicy  
Servin' up red beans and rice  
At midnite she's a-howlin' and stompin'  
Makin' love to the gators in the swampin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I feel you now inside me  
Never once did you deny me  
Doin' that stuff that you do  
Knockin' me out with your voodoo  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Voodoo lady, shakin' that stick, drivin' me crazy  
Voodoo lady, oh yeah

Morgan's pain succumbs to the frame  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
Astral plane conversing lame  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
  
A stained pane drownin' out the rain  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
You name the game and I'll bring Dwayne  
And Roger and Rerun to Wayne's pet youngin'  
  
Rerun's brain - confetti stain  
In a zany combination of Wayne's pet youngin'  
What's your name? Are you glad you came?  
But would you die in the name of Wayne's pet youngin'?  
Yes I would! Aaaahhhh!  
  
Ahahahahahahahaha!  
Ahahahahahahahaha!  
Ha ha!

The wash is out, it's hanging up  
And all I have is nothing  
Nothing to do, nothing to say  
I think I must be dreaming  
  
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin' about  
I don't think I will ever return again my friend  
  
If I was king I'd wear a ring  
And never hurt my people  
I'd stay alert and dress to kill  
I might even slip you something  
  
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin' about  
I don't think I will ever return again my friend  
  
The sun comes up and I'm all washed out  
Is this what Deaner was talkin' about  
I don't think I will ever return again my friend  
I do not think I will ever return again, my friend [2x]

Slow four...one two three four...  
  
Bless the father bless the son  
Cross your heart 'cause you're the one  
Collectin' moon-beams in the mornin'  
Curvy sticks and wooden poles  
Assistin' you in pluggin' holes  
Plug them holes till you see straight through to the mind's eye  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin' round the pool  
You were the fool, and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool, but there's something you can do  
  
You can wash your arm in a pool of mud  
You can chop a tree prevent a flood  
You can speak with a turtle just by flippin' him around  
You can build a boat sail the sea  
You can buy a moat forge a key  
Initiate the sequence create catastrophe  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin' round the pool  
You were the fool, and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool, but there's something you can do  
  
Bless the father bless the son  
Cross your heart 'cause you're the one  
Collectin' moon-beams in the mornin'  
Curvy sticks and wooden poles  
Assistin' you in pluggin' holes  
Plug them holes till you see straight through to the mind's eye  
  
Think about it turn around  
And go back to the quiet sound  
Of Jim and Dan prancin' round the pool  
You were the fool, and I feel sorry for you  
You were the fool, but there's something you can do  
You were the fool

There were beverages laid out for the party  
There were candy and spices and tricolored pastas  
The meat carved was drawn from succulent juices  
Served on platters of the purest gold  
I was calm when we arrived at the party  
I spoke with fervor, embracing the evening  
My wife leaned over and she whispered 'I love you'  
I held her close - we danced  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
Creampuffs and bourbon and the music was louder  
My wife was competing in a game of chance  
The party raged and the guests were screaming  
I could have danced all night  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
Later on when we were under the covers  
I closed my eyes, then I drifted to sleep  
I dreamt about me maybe throwing a party  
And just how great that would be  
And we said  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  
We had the best time at your party  
The wife and I thank you very much  

Gimme that z, o-l-o-f-t  
Gimme a grip, make me love me  
Suckin' 'em down, I'm happy man  
Can feel it inside, makin' me smile  
  
Realize that the sky's not made of gold  
Don't disguise the nature of your soul  
  
Gimme that z, o-l-o-f-t  
No longer pissed and you don't bother me  
I'm makin' it through, I'm givin' my all  
When base are loaded, I'm whacking the ball  
  
Don't suck the mind, don't drain the source  
The path of life's not so easy to course, buddy
