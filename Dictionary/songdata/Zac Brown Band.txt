I play the road,  
And the highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd has come and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
Every exit is a season,  
Every signal is a beacon  
And the wind, it carries me  
And it eases up my load  
Everyday I drag the turns  
Every candle still burns  
And every lesson I have learned  
Brings us closer to the crowd  
  
I play the road,  
And the highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
Well the bus it is our steeple,  
It brings us to the people  
And they will be there waiting,  
Dancing young and old  
And every one of us gets tired,  
But every one remains inspired  
And every one of us require  
To keep picking through our souls  
  
I play the road,  
And the highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
  
She says, "Daddy where do you go  
When you leave me all these nights  
With a suitcase and guitar in your hand?  
Kissing me and mom goodbye with a tear and a smile,  
Where do you go,  
Daddy where do you go?"  
  
I play the road,  
And this highway is our song,  
And every city's like the same three chords  
Been helping us along when the story's told  
And the crowd is done and gone  
Shaking off the miles and trying to make it home  
Shaking off the miles  
(Shaking off the miles)  
(Mile after mile)  
Mile after mile  
Baby, I'm coming home

Cocaine flame in my bloodstream  
Sold my coat when I hit Spokane  
Bought myself a hard pack of cigarettes in the early  
Morning rain  
Lately my hands they don't feel like mine  
My eyes been stung with dust and blind  
Held you in my arms one time  
Lost you just the same  
  
[Chorus]  
Jolene  
I ain't about to go straight  
It's too late  
I found myself face down in a ditch  
Booze in my hair  
Blood in my lips  
A picture of you holding a picture of me  
In the pocket of my blue jeans  
Still don't know what love means  
Still don't know what love means  
Jolene  
  
Been so long since I seen your face  
Or felt a part of this human race  
I've been living out of this here suitcase for way too long  
A man needs something he can hold onto  
A nine pound hammer or a woman like you  
Either one of them things will do  
  
[Chorus]

1, 2, 3  
This is gonna be funky  
  
How come all the pretty girls like you are taken baby  
I've been looking for someone like you to save me  
Life's to easy to be so damn complicated  
Take your time and I'll be waitin'  
  
Keep me in mind  
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely  
Keep me in mind  
And I pray someday that you will love me only  
  
I think about you some days  
And the way I would lay and waste a day after day with you  
We always go our separate ways  
But no-one can love you baby the way I do  
  
Keep me in mind  
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely  
Keep me in mind  
And I pray someday that you will love me only  
  
Well the world can be real tough  
Find shelter in me  
If there's no-one else to love  
Keep me in mind  
  
If ever you wanted me, I'll be your man  
I'd be a fool to let you go with someone else  
Whatever you want from me, I'll be your man  
I'd give it all up just to have you for myself  
  
Keep me in mind  
Somewhere down the road you might get lonely  
Keep me in mind  
And I pray someday that you will love me only  
  
Well the world can be real tough  
Why don't you hold on to me  
When there's no-one else to love  
Keep me in mind  
(Keep me in mind)  
And I'll hold you darling  
(Keep me in mind)  
I'll be your man  
(Keep me in mind)  
I'll hold you darling  
(Keep me in mind)  
C'mon little mama  
Put it on me

There ain't enough of me to go around  
Got all kinds of reasons  
To be all over town  
Spread thin and broken down  
Everybody wants a piece  
Oh darlin' I'm afraid  
  
You've been last but not least  
Everyone I love the most  
Has to take what's left of me  
I put it all together  
But I left out one big piece  
I put you last  
But you're not least  
  
Nothing ever takes the place of you  
Sometimes things that may not matter  
Jump in front of things that do  
And you're fine to stand in line  
While history repeats  
But oh darlin' not this time  
  
Last but not least  
Everyone I love the most  
They deserve the best from me  
I put it all together  
When I found that missing piece  
You were the last  
But you're not least  
  
I go left when I should go right  
I chase the dark when I see light  
I trip and fall down every time I try  
To walk that line  
The sun comes out I look for rain  
I search for joy and I find the pain  
I swear I will never get again  
Last but not least  
  
Last but not least  
Everyone I love the most  
Is gonna see the best of me  
I put it all together  
When I found that missing piece  
You were the last  
You were the last  
But you're not least

Spent the night with a friend of mine and a handle of good whiskey  
We picked guitars and talked about how the glory days we missed 'em  
And it didn't take too long to find the truth inside that bottle  
Cast a-sea so long ago was a message from my father.  
  
You keep your heart above your head and your eyes wide open  
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold  
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you can't  
You gotta let it go  
  
Looking back now on my life I can't say I regret it  
And all the places that I ended up not the way Ma woulda had it  
But you only get once chance at life to leave your mark upon it  
And when a pony he comes riding by you better set your sweet ass on it  
  
And keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open  
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold  
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you can't  
You gotta let it go  
  
Like a sweet sunset in Georgia let it go  
And like the fear that grabs a hold ya let it go  
La la la la la la (let it go, let it go) let it go  
La la la la la la (let it go, let it go) let it go  
  
You keep your heart above your head and you eyes wide open  
So this world can't find a way to leave you cold  
And know you're not the only ship out on the ocean  
Save your strength for things that you can change  
Forgive the ones you can't  
You gotta let it go  
Learn to let it go

Got a quarter...  
I passed out last night and I never made it home.  
Wound up on a bus to San Antone.  
My head hurts bad and I ain't wearing shoes.  
Going to find my wallet and my way back home to you.  
  
We're gonna make this day.  
A little better than the last.  
It's amazing how slow days like this can go.  
Find a way to wash away.  
Any regret you have, don't let this moment pass.  
Live inside this day.  
  
I got cuffs on my hands.  
Chains on my feet.  
I got locked up for the second time this week.  
And I know I make you cry but girl my love is true.  
I'm going to find my wallet and my way back home to you.  
  
We're gonna make this day.  
A little better than the last.  
It's amazing how slow the days like this can go.  
Find a way to wash away.  
Any regret you have, don't let this moment pass.  
Live inside this day.  
  
Now I'm back on the street.  
Thumb in the air.  
Don't know how the hell that I got here.  
But I'm gonna hitch that ride.  
If it's the last thing I do.  
Gonna find that wallet and bring it home to you.  
  
We're gonna make this day.  
A little better than the last.  
Know don't you let this life come whoop your  
Find a way to wash away.  
Any regrets you have  
Don't let this moment pass.  
Live inside this day.

[Chorus]  
Sic 'em on a chicken.  
Sic 'em on a chicken.  
Sic 'em on a chicken and watch them feathers fly  
  
Sic 'em on a chicken.  
Sic 'em on a chicken.  
Sic 'em on a chicken. Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry.  
  
My dog Pete is the smallest dog of all the dogs in my yard  
He's a mean son' bitch  
Drinks Beam and water from a broken mason jar  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sic 'em on a chicken.  
Sic 'em on a chicken.  
Sic 'em on a chicken.  
Bring out the butter and the flour we're ready to fry.  
  
I heard this awful noise coming from the woods  
I heard chicken screams  
Know it ain't gonna be good  
  
Well I think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken because I just heard him cry  
  
Think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken  
Think we lost the chicken but you can get another one for a dollar 79  
  
In a couple of years his spurs have grown  
He wasn't safe to keep around the house  
When he almost took an eyeball from Lonny's son  
And I was sitting at home making fig preserves  
And I'd seen where that rooster kicked him in the eye  
And I knew that that was the day that chicken was going to get what he
deserved  
  
So I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken and Pete hit 'em from the side  
  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken  
I chased the chicken and me and Pete suppered on a home made chicken pot pie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sic 'em on a chicken  
Get that chicken  
I can smell the kitchen and it's almost supper time
