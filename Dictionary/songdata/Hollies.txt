The night turns to dawn  
You're there by my side  
You showed your love  
Baby, that's all  
Baby, that's all  
You're all that I want  
For my love you were made  
Please say to me  
"Baby, you're all, all that I want"  
Say you love me come on home now  
Tell me that you're mine  
Keep me for your own now  
And I will love you all the time  
Ahh-ah-ah-ahh  
  
Baby, that's all  
Baby, that's all  
Say you love me come on home now  
Tell me that you're mine  
Keep me for your own now  
And I will love you all the time  
Ahh-ah-ah-ahh  
The night turns to dawn  
You're there by my side  
You showed your love  
Baby, that's all  
Baby, that's all  
Baby, that's all

How many roads must a man walk down  
Before you call him a man  
How many seas must the white dove sail  
Before she can sleep in the sand  
  
[Chorus]  
The answer, my friend, is blowing in the wind  
The answer is blowing in the wind  
  
Yes, and how many times must a man look up  
Before he can see the sky  
Yes, and how many ears must one man have  
Before he can hear people cry  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, how many years can a mountain exist  
Before it is washed to the sea  
And how many years can some people exist  
Before they're allowed to be free  
  
[Chorus]

I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
Soon as I saw the look in her eyes  
Should known it was over over  
  
I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
'Cause I can't take a warning  
See a girl and fall in love  
With just a pretty face so easy easy  
  
God help me don't want to be  
Don't want to be a loser  
Loser no more  
Please help me help me to see  
Help me to see the chooser  
Chooser for sure  
  
I'm gonna be blue in the morning  
'Cause I can't take a warning  
See a girl and fall in love  
With just a pretty face so easy easy

I don't want to hear your love song  
I got on this aeroplane just to fly  
And I know there's life below me  
But all that you can show me  
Is the prairie and the sky  
  
And I don't want to hear a sad story  
Full of heartbreak and desire  
The last time I felt like this  
I was in the wilderness  
And the canyon was on fire  
  
And I stood on the mountain  
In the night and I watched it burn  
I watched it burn, I watched it burn  
  
[Chorus:]  
I would rock my soul  
In the bosom of Abraham  
I would hold my life  
In his saving grace  
I would walk all the way  
From Boulder to Birmingham  
If I thought I could see  
I could see your face  
  
Well, you really got me this time  
And the hardest part is knowin'  
I'll survive  
I've come to listen for the sound  
Of the trucks as they go down  
Out on ninety-five  
And pretend that it's the ocean  
Comin' down to wash me clean  
To wash me clean  
Baby do ya know what I mean  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]

With Mr Soul or King Creole  
You gotta go with the man in the band  
He'll be your guide  
Singing la la la la  
But what makes Mr Politic  
A lot of words another trick  
Turn peace into war  
Singing ha ha ha ha  
  
Ooh it's not the way we want it  
Not the way at all  
Not the way to change our minds  
Our backs up against the wall  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
For life's a poem  
And we can make it rhyme  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
Let's get it together before we  
Go down, down, down  
I don't want to theorise it  
Just hope people realise  
The simple melody can free your soul  
And let you be man what you are  
And fly la la la  
But every back street slum where  
Pushers push and hookers hook  
Just won't set you free with ha ha ha ha  
Oooh it's not the way we want it  
Not the way at all  
Not the way to change our minds  
Our backs up against the wall  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
For life's a poem  
And we can make it rhyme  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
Let's get it together before we  
Go down, down, down  
Break  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
Oooh it's not the way we want it  
Not the way at all  
Not the way to change our minds  
Our backs up against the wall  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  
The boys in the band all live in harmony  

Jimmy's outside with his motor engine hummin'  
Sent me along to see if you were comin'  
Out onto the highway gonna break the city limits  
Jimmy's gettin ready gonna put his foot in it  
Soft shoe Louie drinkin with his floozy Sue  
Got the invitation the burn out's due  
I'd be a rebel when I'm good and ready  
Headin for the bar  
Tell Jimmy to cool it  
But not to go too far  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
Louie and Jimmy didn't know about the plan  
Cops out on the highway  
Gonna take the job at hand  
Been hidin out for Louie gonna get him canned  
Gonna catch him in the action  
He's gonna wanna make a stand  
Jimmy's impatient wants to burn on rubber  
He's gotta wait for Louie  
Cause there ain't no other  
The undisputed king of the road said "Jimmy, I'm ready You better shift your
load"  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
C'mon and get it, boy  
Louie and Jimmy's out to have a fight  
Shakin hands with the man below  
Stokin' out the flames  
Flames burnin' higher  
One of them has gotta go  
One of them has gotta go  
Highway nine and they're starting to roll  
Jimmy's hearts thumpin  
Blood runnin cold  
Louie looks over and gives a sly smile  
Says look in your mirror boy  
Cops are behind  
Get a move on Jimmy  
You're fallin for the trap  
There's only one winner  
The loser takes the rap  
Well, Bye bye Jimmy,  
Don't wait for me inside

And thanks for the ride  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine  
Burn out on highway nine  
There's gonna be a burn out on highway nine  

Bus stop, wet day, she's there, I say  
Please share my umbrella  
Bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows  
Under my umbrella  
  
All that summer we enjoyed it  
Wind and rain and shine  
That umbrella, we employed it  
By August, she was mine  
  
Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop  
Sometimes she'd shopped and she would show me what she bought  
Other people stared as if we were both quite insane  
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same  
  
That's the way the whole thing started  
Silly but it's true  
Thinkin' of a sweet romance  
Beginning in a queue  
  
Came the sun the ice was melting  
No more sheltering now  
Nice to think that that umbrella  
Led me to a vow  
  
Every morning I would see her waiting at the stop  
Sometimes she'd shopped and she would show me what she bought  
Other people stared as if we were both quite insane  
Someday my name and hers are going to be the same  
  
Bus stop, wet day, she's there, I say  
Please share my umbrella  
Bus stop, bus goes, she stays, love grows  
Under my umbrella  
  
All that summer we enjoyed it  
Wind and rain and shine  
That umbrella, we employed it  
By August, she was mine

We met on the shore of a lemonade lake.  
Weeping willows looked down where we lay.  
Orange blossoms I smell in your hair.  
Butterfly, flutter by, butterfly by.  
  
Waterfalls send your ripples to us  
here on the shore of the lemonade lake.  
Pond lilies play hide and seek with the fish.  
Rabbit run, run rabbit, rabbit run by.  
  
Roaring mountain is standing close by,  
covered with snowdrops and glistening with dew.  
I hear the sound of a small hummingbird.  
I took your hand and I waltzed off with you.  
  
Come to the top of the mountain with me.  
Jump on a cloud and we'll float to and fro.  
Seeing the countryside covered with grass  
and the top of the mountain with candy-floss and snow.  
  
Butterfly lazily drinking the sun,  
lavishly sprinkled and painted with gold.  
Here in the land of the mist and the lake,  
me and my true love will never grow old

(sylvester)  
Cable car, flying high  
Passing stars or wondering why  
Did she go or did she die  
I don't know  
Mountainside, not so green  
Snow is more than ever seen  
Will she come back in a dream  
I don't know  
Thoughts of her reminding me  
Of a time I couldn't see  
Anything but you and me together  
Colored cloud, on you go  
To a land you may not know  
If you see her  
Tell her I'm so alone  
Verse 4  

Driving home I was miles away  
When I thought that I saw your face  
Late at night, a lightning flash  
Put reality in it's place  
I never saw the warning signs  
'Til it was too late  
  
I'm a casualty  
A victim of my own circumstance  
A casualty a hopeless case  
That never stood a chance at all  
  
I never knew what hit me  
Like somebody put out the light  
I was going crazy  
Couldn't tell if it was day or night  
I must have lost direction  
A simple hit and run  
  
I'm a casualty  
A victim of my own circumstance  
A casualty a hopeless case  
That never stood a chance at all  
  
Out of control on a one way street  
Feeling myself beginning to slide  
Out of my head too blind to see  
That you were there just for the ride  
  
Living this life in tragedy  
Why did this happen to me  
  
I'm a casualty  
A victim of my own circumstance  
A casualty a hopeless case  
That never stood a chance at all  
  
I never stood a chance  
I'm a casualty  
I'm a casualty  
I'm a casualty

He rides on his horse and cart, Charlie does.  
Working from six until nine.  
Collecting old rags and used bicycles,  
Old iron of description of any kind.  
  
Here comes Charlie, Charlie the Ragman.  
Throw out your old clothes for Charlie and Fred.  
Earning a living off things we've discarded.  
Earning enough for the board and the bed.  
  
You hear him shout "Rags and old iron."  
Everyone knows him that way.  
Once a week, they come 'round calling.  
How long it's been, I can't say.  
  
[Chorus]  
They live all alone in a hovel.  
He puts his money away.  
Taking enough to just live on,  
And at the end of the day  
He's saving enough  
To put Fred out to graze.  
  
Has anyone seen Charlie lately?  
Charlie just ain't been around.  
Everyone's seen Fred is grazing,  
Chewing the grass from the ground. [Repeat]  
  
Children say Charlie is happy  
Giving balloons to the angels instead.  
Where is Charlie, Charlie the Ragman?  
Don't throw your clothes out

Been so long since I last saw you  
Come on back Come on back  
I'm just feeling lost without you  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didn't you didn't treat me right  
  
[Chorus]  
Why don't you admit you love me  
and come on back come on back  
Say you're always thinking of me  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didn't you didn't treat me right  
  
It's not so very hard (It's not so very hard)  
to make me feel this way (to make me feel this way)  
It's not so very hard (I just can't)  
Can't find the words the words to say  
Can't find the words the words to say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Been so long since I last saw you  
Come on back Come on back  
I'm just feeling lost without you  
Come on back Come on back  
Because you never you never you never held me tight  
You didn't you didn't treat me right  
  
Come on back!

I feel that's something's right  
You don't like holding me tight  
What's wrong with me  
I don't know  
Maybe it's time I should go  
  
But just as I get to the door  
You look at me and say no  
Come and be good to me  
Come and make love to me  
Stay Stay  
  
Cause you like to love me  
And just me and nobody else  
And I like to love you  
And just you and nobody else  
  
We should get out more I know  
But we're just too lazy to go  
What's outside that's not in here  
Nothing's so good that's so near  
  
Verse 2  
  
Chorus  
  
Verse 2  
  
Chorus

If you know you're right  
When the others are wrong  
It's hard to sit and take it  
They treat you like you've lost your senses  
Call you troublemaker  
  
I'm not trying to cause you trouble  
I don't want to fight  
Someone's got to stand up sometime  
And do what's right  
  
Just have the courage of  
The courage of your convictions  
  
People tell you do what's right  
And set and good example  
Sometimes right means who to hate  
Listen to the people  
I'm not trying to mess your mind up  
But it's plain to see  
People pulling from both sides  
It's agitating me  
  
So have the courage of  
The courage of your convictions  
  
People teaming up on sides  
Hating one another  
Know your heart before you join  
A team to hurt your brother  
  
If there's a way to lead us from this  
Like in troubled times  
It won't be found through blood and hate  
But through courageous minds

All is dark  
The moat is dry  
Shadows fall  
The roof lets in the sky  
All these memories  
Go round in my head  
Of the life I have led  
  
Minstrels play  
Familiar melodies  
And once more  
The past comes back to me  
All these memories  
Go round in my head  
Of the life I have led  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh, oh, since I've been gone  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh, oh, what have I done  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh, oh, since I've been gone  
  
The grass has grown much taller now  
Over running everything  
Oh, oh, since I've been gone  
  
All is dark  
The moat is dry  
Shadows fall  
The roof lets in the sky  
All these memories  
Go round in my head  
Of the life I have led

Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
What else can I do  
I've been this way everyday  
now that we're through  
  
Do I love you  
You can bet your life that I do-do-do  
Do I love you  
I would drink my wine from your sh-sh-shoe  
  
Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
It's all down to on you  
I've been this way everyday  
thinking of you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Stoned all the time on dandelion wine  
What else can I do  
I've been this way everyday  
now that we're through

Dear Eloise, I am writing to say  
A number of funny things I heard today.  
I heard that he's left you, and run off to see.  
Could be the best thing that's happened to me.  
  
Writing a letter to make you feel better.  
Sorry to hear that he left you that way.  
I could have told ya,  
He was much older,  
So much older than you.  
  
You loved him blindly,  
He treated ya kindly,  
Until he found out what he could get from you.  
You should have departed, before he got started.  
Now you've been burned just like I said you would.  
  
Please read my letter closely,  
It's beneficial to you,  
Must read in between the lines,  
A message you will see.  
If you use your mind you'll find,  
I want you bad with me-eee-eeee  
  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba- ba ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba- ba ba ba ba ba ba  
  
Writing a letter, to make you feel better.  
Sorry to hear that he left you that way.  
I could have told ya,  
He was much older.  
So much older than you.  
So much older that you.  
So much older than you.  
  
Dear Eliose, I am writing to say  
A number of funny things I heard today.  
I heard that he's left you and run off to see.  
Could be the best thing that's happened to me.

Young girls and porches are filling out  
Tempers and torches are burning  
Brown is the color of town  
Living in thunder  
  
Hair on my top lip now I'm a man  
I so often hear and feel it  
Nice paying the price for being kept under  
  
Mama says don't hang around that front gate too long  
Boys like you who stay too late are surely gonna go so wrong  
But Mama there's safety in numbers  
It's the first time I've ever felt strong  
Delaware Taggett and the Outlaw Boys  
Adding a laugh to the Broadway noise  
Slipping your mind where your mind don't want to go  
  
Off-duty porters lay sleeping wives  
On-duty daughters are finding  
Why just touching a boy gives a thrill like a shiver  
  
Whispers and shadows are moving fast  
No prizes given to people  
Last drowned in the past down on the river

When you come across  
The guy who thinks he's boss  
Yet never knows the reason why  
He won't let you pass  
Won't answer things you ask  
He's got his orders, do or die  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone said to me  
If you tip the doorman heavily  
His doors will open wide for you  
Goes to show what money can do  
Win again, lose again  
Don't feel sad when things go bad  
You just do the best you can  
Do the best you can  
  
Please be kind to those  
Who fail to comprehend  
And in time, who knows  
You'll maybe make a friend  
  
If you leave your car  
And you're not going far  
Remember what time to be back  
If it slips your mind  
I'm sure in time you'll find  
A Rita waiting in a mac  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Win again, lose again  
Don't feel sad when things go bad  
You just do the best you can  
Do the best you can  
Do the best you can

You broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance,  
You didn't even want me around.  
And now I'm back to let you know I can really shake 'em down.  
  
Do you love me?  
(I can really move, )  
Do you love me?  
(I'm in the groove.)  
Now do you love me?  
(Do you love me now that I can dance?)  
Watch me, now.  
(Work, work)  
Ah,work it out baby.  
(work, work)  
Well, you're drivin' me crazy.  
(work, work)  
With just a little bit of soul, now  
(work!)  
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist,  
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?  
Tell me,  
(Tell me,)  
Tell me.  
  
Do you love me?  
(I can really move, )  
Do you love me?  
(I'm in the groove.)  
Now do you love me?  
(Do you love me now that I can dance?)  
Watch me, now.  
(Work, work)  
Ah,work it out baby.  
(work, work)  
Well, you're drivin' me crazy.  
(work, work)  
With just a little bit of soul, now  
(work!)  
Now I can mash potatoes, I can do the twist,  
Tell me, baby, do you like it like this?  
Tell me,  
(Tell me,)

If a foolish fool like me  
Can read you easily  
Then something must be wrong  
  
Something's different when we speak  
It seems the past few weeks  
Our love's not been so strong  
  
Lovers have always had this problem  
Ask anyone, you'll see  
We've got to hang on til it passes  
Don't give up easily  
  
If we say what's on our minds,  
We'd save a lot of time  
Don't give up easily  
  
I know you're feeling bad  
Sometimes I make you sad  
But when you're feeling sad,  
I'm feeling just as bad  
  
During the good times it's so easy  
You are in love like me  
Sometimes we feel we want to leave it  
Don't give up easily  
  
If we say what's on our minds,  
We'd save a lot of time  
Don't give up easily  
Ask anyone, you'll see  
They'll say the same as me  
Don't give easily

The sun is overshadowed by the presence of the moon  
Night time has fallen, she'll be comin' home soon  
Leave the door wide open, ah, so she won't need a key  
Lock it behind you baby, draw the blinds so no one can see  
There's only one thing on my mind  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Silence is golden, ah, for me there's just one choice  
The music of your laughter, ripplin' of your voice  
The freshness of the evergreen, ah, fades as if too shy  
Can't compete with your beauty, couldn't if it tried  
There's only one thing on my mind  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Let's build somethin' to climb on  
Makin' the show a live one  
No need for make-up, let's be real  
Give all in what you're givin'  
Makin' life worth livin'  
Bein' alive's how you should feel  
Oh and don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Don't want the sun to be shinin'  
Raisin' his eyebrows at the moon  
Sayin' I told you, so she wouldn't show  
Well, don't speak too soon  
I hear her footsteps  
Walkin' on the outer floor  
Well, it could be  
I don't know, I don't know for sure  
There's only one thing on my mind  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Don't let, don't let me down  
Feelings are near the ground  
Come on back, can't live without you  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I need you, I need you, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I want you, I want you, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I love you, I love you, I)  
Come on back, can't live without you  
(I need you, I need you, I)  

Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide them all  
Don't run and hide now, 'cause you're only hurting yourself  
Ask me why and I'll tell you things that you never heard now  
'Bout yourself what they're saying, I know that it will hurt you  
Please fight back, it's important how you accept their lies now  
If you run, you condemn yourself and they'll realize now  
Then you'll be hurtin' me

Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide them all  
Don't run and hide now, 'cause you're only hurting yourself

Stay with me you'll convince them all that it isn't true now  
Be with me and we'll prove just how strong our love can be now  
Please fight back, it's important how you accept their lies now  
If you run, you condemn yourself and they'll realize now  
Then you'll be hurtin' me  
'Cause I'm left on my own and I've got them to face  
Don't run and hide from the people  
Don't run and hide them all  
Don't run and hide now, 'cause you're only hurting yourself  
Don't run and hide from the people

(Ballard Jr)  
Don't you even care what's gonna happen to me, whoah  
You're turning me loose and I never asked to be free, no  
After all that we've been through  
How can you let it end  
I wanna be your lifetime man  
But you wanna be my friend  
Don't you even care what's gonna happen to me, whoah  
Don't you even care what's gonna happen to me  
  
How will I spend my days  
What will I do each night  
I could go out alone  
Somehow it don't seem right  
  
Do, yeah  
Do, yeah  
  
Chorus  
  
Don't you ever think about anybody but you  
After you have gone, babe  
What am I gonna do, oh  
So, come on, baby, change your mind  
Please stay here with me  
Come on, baby, we'll be fine  
Just you wait and see  
  
Don't you even care what's gonna happen to me, whoah  
Don't you even care what's gonna happen to me  
Do, yeah Do, yeah Do yeah

Good to see you again, Rosie  
I know I've changed a lot since then  
You're lookin' fine, babe  
Three years that ain't long, Rosie  
I still remember our song  
When you were mine, babe  
Times change, times change I know  
But it sure moves slow  
Down river when you're locked away  
Hey why didn't you write, Rosie  
I stayed awake most every night  
Countin' my time babe  
Oh no I ain't mad Rosie  
I know you had to mind your dad  
But just a line babe  
Oh sure I remember then  
We went off to school  
Ain't that right  
Well he ain't no fool  
He's a good man Rosie  
Hold him tight as you can  
Don't ask me why babe  
Yeah nice seein' you again Rosie  
Me I got things to do  
Well good-bye babe

Down river when you're locked away  
Rosie I'm losing

Eleanor's Castle, boy, what a hassle  
Why did you have to build yorr walls so high?  
I'd put my arm around you, but a moat surrounds you  
The only way's to let your drawbridge down  
  
Nights without number, I'm without slumber  
Thinking of ways to breach your turrets tall  
You're an iron lady and someday maybe  
You'll forget to bar the iron door  
  
Man was made to conquer, so the story goes  
I wish I knew who said it he could help me 'cause he knows  
This situation's gettin' way out of line  
I can't win if you won't let me in  
Ain't it a sin? (it's a sin she won't let him in)  
  
Break  
  
Shielded from my advances, there's very few chances  
I'm a one man crusade fightin' in vain  
Rack my brains for ideas but it appears  
Compared to you dragons are easily slain  
  
Eleanor's Castle boy, what a hassle  
Why did you have to build your walls so high?  
Nights without number, I'm without slumber  
Thinking of ways to breach your turrets tall  
Shielded from my advances, there's very few chances  
I'm a one man crusade fight' in vain

On top of a hill is a nice place to be at  
Diggin' the country for miles around  
Watchin' the people like ants on a hillside  
Running around, running around  
  
So far below me I see the confusion  
Small-minded men with their small-minded wives  
If they could see themselves where I am standing  
They'd alter their lives, alter their lives  
  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
Climb up here, jump up here  
Skip up, or run up  
Get up here somehow ''cause you'll find your head  
Finally finding the level you're after  
Ego is dead, ego is dead  
  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky  
  
Wish they'd start using the path of tomorrow  
There's only way up and one way down  
Decide for yourself on the path you'll be taking  
When you look down, down and around  
  
And I'm so high up I touch the sky...

Every day, it's a-getting closer  
Going faster than a roller coaster  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
  
Every day, it's a a-getting faster  
Everyone says go ahead and ask her  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
  
Every day seems a little a longer  
Every way loves a little stronger  
Come what may, do you ever long for  
True love from me?  
  
Verse 1  
Verse 3  
Verse 1  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
Love like yours will surely come my way  
  
Every day, every day, every day...  
(words of love you whisper soft and true  
Darling, I love you.)  
  
(listen to me to what I say  
Our hearts can be nearer each day  
Hold me darling, please listen to me)

Went to a fortune teller  
To have my fortune read  
I didn't know what to tell her  
I had a dizzy feeling in my head  
  
She took a hold of my palm  
She said Son you feel kind of warm  
And then she looked into a crystal ball  
She said You're in love  
  
I said how could that be so  
I'm not friendly with the girls I know  
She said when the next one arrives  
You gotta look into her eyes  
  
I left there in a hurry  
Looking forward to my big surprise  
The next day I discovered  
That the fortune teller told me lies  
  
I rushed straight back to that woman  
Just as mad as I could be  
I said I didn't see nobody  
Why'd she made a fool of me  
  
Then something struck me  
Like lightning from up above  
While looking at the fortune teller  
I fell in love  
  
Now I'm a happy fella  
I'm married to the fortune teller  
I'm as happy as I can be  
Now I get my fortunes told for free

Oh woman get your head out of curlers !  
Time to get your butt out of bed !  
Get down your hats and your baggage my child  
  
Going back home getting back to the homestead.  
I'm gonna heat me some water  
  
Put a shine upon my shoes.  
Telephone my mac keep the room above Joe's  
Cause we're coming back  
Coming back to the homestead.  
Ev'rything is packed gettin' back to the homestead this time.  
This time we'll stay  
Baby.  
  
I know that we could have made it.  
We had ideas in our heads.  
And I wish somehow we could have saved it  
  
But we're gasoline alley bred.  
Yet the years haven't really been wasted  
  
And I know it in my head.  
We did good for the life that we tasted  
Cause we're gasoline alley  
Gasoline alley bred.  
  
Woman did you really believe it  
  
I did ev'rything a man could do.  
Breakin' my back just to make us a dime.  
That don't mean a thing when no one wants to know you.  
I've seen the hurt upon your face.  
How many times do you think that I've cried  
  
Knowin' ev'ry day your heart was gettin' broken  
  
Holdin' back your pride 'till you were nearly chocking  
Oh  
Let's get away  
Baby

Back off baby  
Don't lean too hard  
I'll come 'round when I'm ready  
I ain't finished my playing 'round  
Don't want to go steady  
You gotta give me time  
Give me time give me time  
You gotta give me time  
Give me time give me time  
The feeling in me ain't the same as yours  
I'm still first-class flying  
You've gotta wait till I reach the ground  
No need to be lying  
chorus  
to think it over  
Don't try so hard  
Don't spoil your chance  
Don't try so hard  
Don't spoil your chance  
verse 1  
chorus  
To think it over  
Give me time  
Give me time give me time  
You gotta give time  
Give me time give me time

Harlequin has lost his crown  
Look they say a broken clown  
Yesterday he ruled the world  
Now he's crying to be heard  
Yesterday he called the tune  
Now he's howling at the moon  
Harlequin has broken down  
Harlequin, Harlequin has lost his crown  
  
Harlequin has broken loose  
Slipped the knot and skipped the noose  
Can those bloodhounds find his trail  
Will they send him back to jail  
Can those bloodhounds find his scent  
Will they find out where he went  
Harlequin cannot be found  
Harlequin, Harlequin has gone to ground  
  
Harlequin is back on top  
Now his fame will never stop  
See him shown from coast to coast  
He's the one they love the most  
See them slap him on the back  
How they love his every crack  
Harlequin we knew you'd do it  
Harlequin, Harlequin  
  
Harlequin, Harlequin  
Harlequin, Harlequin  
Harlequin, Harlequin  
Harlequin, Harlequin

You read the stars  
Everyday in the paper  
And believe every word they say  
You want to know  
If I'll always love you  
But I can't see tomorrow today  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
The story is always unwinding  
But right here and now  
It doesn't matter  
Are you having a good time  
  
You know that I'm no fortune teller  
I can't predict  
How it will be  
You need a love that lasts forever  
That far ahead  
I just can't see  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
I don't know what might've happen  
But this me and you in this situation  
Are you having a good time  
  
If everything's perfect  
What more could we ask for  
We're here and now  
  
Are you having a good time  
You're somewhere off  
Into the future  
Imagining how it will look  
Will we last another chapter  
Can we make it last 'til the end of the book  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
The story is always unwinding  
But right here and now  
It doesn't matter  
Having a good time  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
I don't know what might've happen  
But this me and you in this situation  
Are you having a good time  
  
So, I can't guarantee  
A happy ending  
The story is always unwinding  
But right here and now  
It doesn't matter  
Are you having a good time

Heartbeat, why do you miss  
When my baby kisses me?  
  
Heartbeat, why does your love kiss  
Stay in my memory?  
  
Pittery-pat.  
I know that new love thrills me.  
I know that true love will be.  
  
Heartbeat, why do you miss  
When my baby kisses me?  
  
Heartbeat, why do you skip  
When my baby's lips meet mine?  
  
Heartbeat, why do you flip  
Then give me a skip each time?  
  
Pittery-pat.  
Sing to me love's story  
Bring to me love's glory.  
  
Pittery-pat.  
I know that new love thrills me.

I know that new love thrills me.  
I know that true love will be.

I woke up in the morning  
Heard a mockingbird sing  
Was he laughing at me?  
I went to the basin  
Washed the sleep out my eyes  
So I could see  
A note on the bed  
Close to where my lover should be  
She slipped away in the night  
The writing was shaky  
And with tears on the sheets  
I'm sorry we had a fight  
So, farewell sweet lover, farewell  
I'm sorry we never said goodbye  
So, farewell sweet lover, farewell  
Left with a tear in your eye  
Must've been brewing for a very long time  
In the wardrobe the hangers are bare  
Don't know how you did it  
It must've been planned  
You even took your favorite chair  
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye  
You won't find no tear in my eye  
So, goodbye my lady, goodbye  
Going out tonight to get high  
Found myself at Charlie's scene  
Drinking all fashions  
Sticky painted movie queen  
Winked her eye at me  
That's how it happened  
Diamond shoes, satin dress  
Flashin', flashin', flashin', flashin'  
Woke up in the morning  
Heard my mockingbird sing  
And it was singin' for me  
The lady I met last night's  
Here by my side  
She's good company  
Well, hello sweet lady, hello  
Good morning with a smile  
Well, hello sweet lady, hello  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
Lady, lady  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  
This lady's gonna make it alright  

She walked into the room just like a dream  
I was spellbound into silence  
Do you know the way it feels  
The rock'n'roll changed to a symphony  
Appearing just like magic  
But I knew that she was real  
Then something deep inside of me  
Said go ahead and try  
Ain't no use in holdin back  
Don't kiss the chance goodbye  
Hello to romance  
Is it goodbye to those one night stands  
Where you get what you want  
Such a crazy steal  
Hello to romance  
Hello to romance  
I walked across the room to say hello  
She raised her head and smiled at me  
I knew which way to go  
Once she spoke sweet music filled my ears  
For hours and hours and hours we talked  
Time seemed to disappear  
verse 2  
chorus  
When you see the chance to win romance  
Act before it slips away  
Don't wait until tomorrow  
To hear yourself say  
I should've done it yesterday  
Should've done it yesterday  
verse 2  
chorus  
chorus  

Here I go again.  
Watch it now 'cos  
Here I go again.  
I've been hurt so much before.  
  
I told myself,  
Yes I did,  
No more, no more won't get hurt any more.  
There I was by myself  
  
Doin' all right  
Until I saw you last night.  
And then I knew that  
Here I go again.  
  
I cannot help it.  
Here I go again.  
Making the same mistakes,  
Heading for more heartaches.  
  
What can I do when there's nothing I can do?  
I looked in your eyes and I knew that I was blue.  
What 's the use?  
I'll just give in.  
  
Try as I may,  
And I do,  
I'll never win, never win, baby I'll never win.  
Now, you're here, so close to me.  
  
I can't resist you,  
And I knew when I kissed you.  
I'm gonna sing now  
Here I go again.  
  
Watch it now 'cos  
Here I go again.  
Falling in love, in love.  
Falling in love, in love.  
  
Falling in love, in love.  
Falling in love.

Starlight on my face  
Moon bright on the ground  
Fill this empty space  
Rest the travel bound  
After weary days  
Lady luck please smile  
Show the many ways  
We can go where wishes go  
Let's chase the shadow child  
  
Here in my dreams  
Love is warm, love is golden  
Causin' me to believe  
I have touch, I have seen

Hey Willy your mother calls you Billy  
Your father calls you silly  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
Hey baby you're dressing like a lady  
The fellows call you Sadie  
But you really are a pretty one  
  
You don't care  
What they say about your hair

Every time he shows his face

My daddy used to tell me  
When I was under his wing  
If you want to live a good life  
Just remember one thing  
Though the world that we live in  
Can be so unkind  
If you love a good woman  
It's all honey and wine  
  
I thought my daddy was wrong  
Girl I was so lonely  
Until you came along  
You began with the holding  
Yeah the kissing was fine  
All that was ready for the tasting  
Was the honey and wine  
  
It's all honey and wine now  
It's all honey and wine  
If you love a good woman  
It's all honey and wine  
  
It's all honey and wine now  
It's all honey and wine  
It's all honey and wine  
  
It's all honey and wine now  
It's all honey and wine  
If you love a good woman it's all honey and wine

A winter's day in a deep and dark december  
I am alone  
Gazing from my window to the street below  
On a freshly fallen , silent shroud of snow  
  
I am a rock I am an island  
  
Don't talk of love  
Well, I've heard the word before  
It's sleeping in my memory  
Don't disturb the slumber  
Of feelings that have died  
If I never loved, I never would have cried  
  
Chorus  
  
I build walls  
A fortress deep and might  
That none may penetrate  
I have no need of friendship  
Friendship causes pain  
It's laughter and it's loving I disdain  
  
Chorus  
  
I have my books  
And my poetry to protect me  
I am shielded in my armor  
Hiding in my room, safe within my womb  
I touch no one and no one touches me  
  
Chorus  
  
And a rock feels no pain  
And an island never cries  
  
Chorus x 2

Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say good-bye  
Feel so bad baby  
Oh it hurts me  
When I think of how you love and desert me  
I'm the broken-hearted toy you play with  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
Though I'm just one of your lovers  
And I know there are so many others  
You do something strange to me baby  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say good-bye  
I know that it's wrong and I should be so strong  
But the thought of you gone  
Makes me want to hold on  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
You got me goin'  
I need you baby  
I can't let go  
And I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
I can't let go

I had a dream  
You were so near to me  
but when I woke you were gone  
when I woke you were gone  
  
Thinking of you  
being so far away  
I guess I got memories  
guess I got memories  
  
When I am alone I feel your golden hair  
Skyline of silver-blue  
Trying to find words to pacify  
my feelings of loneliness for you  
  
(Repeat)  
I had a dream  
You are so near to me  
but when I wake you are gone  
when I wake you are gone  
when I wake you are gone

I thought of you last night  
I thought of you and thought of you  
Until the morning light  
I couldn't sleep, I couldn't sleep last night  
  
I wanted you last night  
I wanted you and wanted you  
And wished with all my might  
You'd come to me, you'd come to me last night  
  
Darling, my darling, I can't live without you  
I'm lonely, so lonely when you're out of sight  
  
I'll wait for tonight  
I'll wait for you and wait for you  
And long to hold you tight  
Bring your love to me, your love to me tonight  
  
I'll wait for tonight  
I'll wait for you and wait for you  
And long to hold you tight  
Bring your love to me, your love to me tonight  
Bring your love to me, your love to me tonight

Shook my head out of dreams reality's calling  
The early bird's been up all morning  
But I've got no notion of moving from where I am  
Though my legs won't move I feel disabled  
I'm on a shelf an article labeled  
Waiting for someone to fetch me from lost and found  
  
I'm down no one to hear me calling  
I'm down no one to see me falling  
  
Had my ways with days of sunshine  
Life came easy it all fell in line  
But then again I didn't realize  
When you're used to one thing it's hard to accept  
Another like the woman who brought you up  
She ain't your mother  
How do you cope with a thing like that  
  
I'm down no one to hear me calling...  
  
Always thought it was my dad who went to war  
Thought it was my sister who fell off the wall  
My pseudo brother Billy emigrated long ago  
Someone went through' pain to have me  
Someone should know I'm down  
  
Folks who brought me up I'm not ungrateful  
Kept the secret from me they thought it was shameful  
It hurt me so to be the last one to know  
Maybe someone's out there looking for me  
Left on their own couldn't afford to clothe me  
And I  
I don't even know my real name  
  
I'm down no one to hear me calling...

I see the snowflakes falling  
I hear the drumbeat calling  
I am just only lonely Indian girl  
Braver than all the brave now  
I sit at every pow-wow  
I fought a million men for Indian girl  
  
Ten hides and twenty horses  
That's what the tribal law says  
Too much for me to pay for Indian girl  
  
Oh sun shine on sun shine on  
And take my darkness away  
Oh sun shine on sun shine on  
And bring this girl my way  
  
Far from her lonely teepee  
Wind sends her sweetness to me  
Too much for me to bear my Indian girl  
Gather your things together  
And bring your wedding feather  
We'll steal away forever Indian girl  
  
Chorus x2

Don't raise your voice to me  
And don't be unkind  
I'm just a foolish man  
Who doesn't know his mind  
There is a reason  
I don't love you like I should  
And it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh it's you  
  
Try understanding  
I'm a simple man at heart  
The way you carry on  
I think we'll drift apart  
I can't afford to live  
The way you want us to  
So, it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh, it's you  
  
Why can't I love you  
Why can't I love you  
Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for  
  
If everything is wrong  
We'll go our separate way  
You'll have to find a man  
Who does just what you say  
To break up is a shame  
It spoils the chance we had  
But it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh, it's you  
  
Why can't I love you  
Why can't I love you  
Cause I'm not the kind of man you are looking for  
  
If everything is wrong  
We'll go our separate way  
You'll have to find a man  
Who does just what you say  
To break up is a shame  
It spoils the chance we had  
But it's you  
Yes, it's you  
Oh, it's you

(ransford)  
I, I've been wrong before  
But I know for sure  
That I saw you last night  
Out with another guy  
It nearly made me cry  
So I'm telling your girl  
Stand by me my love  
And I'll give you anything you want anytime you want  
So stand by me my love  
And I'll give you everything  
And I'll give you everything  
Break  
Stand by me my love  
And I'll give you anything you want anytime you want  
So stand by me my love  
And I'll give you everything  
And I'll give you everything  
I, I've been wrong before  
But I know for sure  
That I saw you last night  
Out with another guy  
It nearly made me cry  
So I'm telling your girl  
Cry  
So I'm telling you girl  
Cry  
So I'm telling you girl  
Cry  

White chalk, written on red brick.  
Our love, told in a heart.  
It's there, drawn in the playground.  
Love, kiss, hate or adore.  
  
I love Jennifer Eccles.  
I know that she loves me.  
I love Jennifer Eccles.  
I know that she loves me.  
  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la.  
La la la la la la la  
La la la la la la.  
  
I used to carry her satchels.  
She used to walk by my side.  
But when we got to her doorstep,  
Her dad wouldn't let me inside.  
  
One Monday morning, found out I'd made the grade.  
Started me thinking, had she done the same?  
  
verse 2  
  
verse 4  
  
I hope Jennifer Eccles  
Is going to follow me there.  
Our love is bound to continue.  
Love, kiss, hate or adore. Singing,

verse 2

(Sill)  
Sweet silver angels over the sea  
Please come down flying low for me  
  
One time I trusted a stranger  
'cause I heard his sweet song  
And it was gently enticing me  
Though there was something wrong  
When I turned he was gone  
  
Blinding me his song remains reminding me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
Oh but Jesus was a crossmaker  
  
Chorus  
  
He wages war with the devil  
A pistol by his side  
And though he chases him out my window and  
Won't give him a place to hide  
He keeps his door open wide  
Fighting him  
He lights a lamp inviting him  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
Oh but Jesus was a crossmaker  
  
Chorus  
  
I hear the thunder come rumbling  
The light never looked so dim  
I see the junction get nearer  
And danger's in the wind  
And either road's looking grim  
  
Hiding me I flee desire's dividing me  
He's a bandit and a heartbreaker  
Oh but Jesus was a crossmaker  
Yeah but Jesus was a crossmaker

Nobody feels any pain  
Tonight as I stand inside the rain  
Everybody knows that baby's got new clothes  
But lately I seen her ribbons and her bows  
Have fallen from her curls  
  
Oh, she takes just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she aches just like a woman  
Yeah but she breaks just like a little girl  
  
Mary, she's my friend  
Yes, I believe, I'll go see her again  
Nobody has to guess that baby can't be blessed  
'Til she finally sees that she's like all the rest  
With her fog, her amphetamines and her pearls  
  
Oh, she takes just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she aches just like a woman  
Yeah but she breaks just like a little girl  
  
It was rainin' from the first  
I was dyin' of thirst  
So I came in here  
  
And your longtime curse  
Hurts but what's worse  
Is this pain in here?  
I can't stay in here, ain't it clear?  
  
I just can't fit  
Yes, I believe it's time for us to quit  
When we meet again, introduced as friends  
Please don't let on that you knew me when  
I was hungry and it was your world  
  
Oh, she takes just like a woman  
Yes she does  
And she makes love just like a woman  
She aches just like a woman  
Yeah, takes just like a woman  
Yeah, makes love just like a woman

Just one look  
I felt so I, I, I'm in love  
with you  
I found out  
  
How good it feels  
To have your love  
Say you will  
Will be mine  
  
Forever and always  
Just one look and I knew  
That you were my only one  
  
I thought I was dreaming  
But I was wrong, yeah yeah yeah  
Oh, but I'm gonna keep on scheming  
'Til I can make you  
Make you my own  
  
Can't you see  
That I really care  
Without you  
I'm nothin'  
Just one look  
And I knew  
I'll get you some day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just one look, that's all it took  
Just one look

Keep off of that friend of mine, ah-ah-ah  
He's not for you, ah-ah-ah  
He just wants to spin you a line, ah-ah-ah  
There's nothin' new ah-ah-ah  
Just one thought on his mind  
You know it's that kind you shoulda  
Known when you met him you must be blind  
  
Seems like only yesterday  
That girl was mine in every way  
People couldn't part us if they tried  
Now she's turned her head away  
She's lost her smile she's not so gay  
Won't you come back to my side  
  
Keep off of that friend of mine, ah-ah-ah  
He's not for you, ah-ah-ah  
He just wants to spin you a line, ah-ah-ah  
There's nothin' new ah-ah-ah  
Just one thought on his mind  
You know it's that kind you shoulda  
Known when you met him you must be blind  
  
Seems like only yesterday  
That girl was mine in every way  
People couldn't part us if they tried  
Now she's turned her head away  
She's lost her smile she's not so gay  
Won't you come back to my side  
  
Keep off of that friend of mine  
Keep off of that friend of mine  
Keep off of that friend of mine  
Keep off of that friend of mine  

Life is good looking through the eyes of love  
beautiful looking through the eyes of love  
  
But you know I'm telling you girl  
life ain't all the same  
Take a look take a look around you now  
You'll find that  
though it seems great life is just a crazy scene  
  
You and me seem to see right through a haze  
People laugh but we both know that it pays  
  
[Chorus]  
I want you to know how I feel  
When you go the world ain't real  
I want you to know how I feel  
When you go the world ain't real  
  
It's all balanced on the keen edge of a knife  
Let's all laugh at the craziness of life  
  
[Chorus]

If you could only see me.  
And know exactly were I am.  
You wouldn't want to be me,  
Oh I can assure you of that.  
  
I'm not the guy to run with,  
Cause I'll pull you off the line.  
I'll break you and destroy you  
Give time.  
  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's king Midas in Reverse.  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's King Midas in Reverse.  
  
It's plain to see it's hopeless,  
Goin' on the way we are.  
So even though I loose you,  
You'll be better off by far.  
  
He's not the man to hold your trust,  
Everything he touches turns to dust in his hands.  
Nothing he can do is right, he'd even like to sleep at night, but he can't.  
  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
All he touches turns to dust  
  
I wish someone would find me,  
And help me gain control.  
Before I loose my reason,  
And my soul  
  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's King Midas in reverse.  
He's King Midas with a curse.  
He's king Midas in Reverse.  
  
He's King Midas with a curse  
(all he touches turns to dust)  
He's Kind Midas in Reverse.  
(all he touches turns to dust)  
He's King Midas with a curse,  
(all he touches turns to dust)  
He's King Midas in Reverse

Sometime in October  
We sailed from England's shore  
When we sailed into a raging storm  
Like I never ever seen before  
And all of the crew they were brave men  
But the captain he was braver  
And he said  
"Never mind the ship me boys  
There's none of us here can save her"  
  
Let her go down Swim for your lives  
Swim for your children swim for your wives  
Let her go down Let her go down  
  
Lost in the open ocean  
There was some of the crew and me  
While the captain steered our wounded ship  
To the bottom of an angry sea  
And with his dying breath  
We all heard him say  
"It's just the fortune of sailor"  
And he said  
"Never mind the ship me boys  
There's none of us here can save her"  
  
Chorus  
  
He wondered if his shipmates  
Were ready to just pray and give in  
So he called their names out one by one  
But there was no one else around but him  
He saw the ship go down the fading light  
And he knew that they could have saved her  
He said  
"The captain lied when the captain cried  
'There's none of us here can save her' "  
  
Chorus  
  
Swim for your lives  
Swim for your children swim for your wives  
Let her go down Let her go down  
Swim for your lives

Always there when I want you  
I know you'll answer my call  
We've got our own situations  
We don't get into small talk  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour  
Whoa oh  
Fate brought us together  
We knew we'd both fall  
Shouldn't really have happened  
It caught us on the rebound, baby  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour  
Whoa oh  
It always rains when I see you  
But we weather the storm  
We get on with the action  
So bring on the black clouds, baby  
Let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour  
Whoa oh  
You belong to somebody  
You ain't mine I ain't yours  
It doesn't really matter  
So let's close the door  
It's never easy to leave you  
Don't like you lockin' the door  
So raise your glass to the next time  
Though my cup's overflowing baby  
Baby, let it pour  
Whoa oh, let it pour  

If you'd only realize  
I'd been happy with you once before  
Can't you let it be the same and more  
Without you fighting me fighting me  
  
If you could only look into my eyes  
Then you would see the truth within them lies  
That I am trying hard to bring us back together  
  
You try so hard to complicate our love  
But underneath it all it's pride my love  
That's hurting us and keeping us apart  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I start to wonder if it's worth it all  
But then I look at you and start to fall  
In love again like every time before  
In love again like every time before  
In love again like every time before

Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Have you ever wondered why  
When everything goes wrong  
Nobody stops to lend a hand  
Nobody seems to care  
Then she looks you in the eye  
And suddenly you're strong  
And very soon you realise  
That you didn't care about love  
  
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind  
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find  
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care  
And very soon you've forgotten that you didn't care about love  
  
Does it hurt to realise  
You've been acting very strange  
Refusing to take the love she gives  
Pretending you don't care  
Did it take you by surprise  
To discover how you'd changed  
How you forgot to remember  
That you didn't care about love  
  
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind  
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find  
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care  
And very soon you've forgotten  
That you didn't care about love  
  
Listen to me I'll sing a song to change your mind  
Your ears are deaf, your mouth is dumb, your eyes are blind  
Listen to me and very soon I think you'll find  
Somebody wants to help you, somebody seems to care  
And very soon you've forgotten  
That you didn't care about love

Well, little, bitty, pretty one I love you so

Well, lovey-dovey, dovey one, sit down on my knee  
Well, little, bitty, pretty one, I'll never let you be free  
Gonna tell you a story, yeah, about long time ago  
Well, little, bitty, pretty one, you know I'll never let you go

You leave me sad and lonely  
Sitting here oh so blue  
Since you went away and told me, baby,  
Yeah that we're through  
Now baby, c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon little lover  
C'mon and discover  
My love for you  
Trying to forget you  
Getting you outta my mind  
I'm gonna search all over this world  
And find some other kind  
Now some other lover (c'mon little lover)  
Some other lover (c'mon little lover)  
C'mon little lover  
C'mon and discover  
My love for you  
Break  
Writing you a letter  
Feeling oh so blue  
I've been crying my heart out baby  
Since you said we're through  
Now baby c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon (c'mon little lover)  
Yeah c'mon little lover  
C'mon and discover  
My love for you  

Heading out on my way to nowhere  
Just a traveling man  
Hitching rides along the highway  
From whoever I can  
Gotta stop someplace somewhere  
And put some leather on my shoes  
They're the only pair that get me there  
Any horizon that I choose  
I know when the cold wind blows  
My coat will keep me warm  
I've got no woman's love  
To call my own  
I saw you lying there  
A cast-off from another man  
So I picked you up took you home  
And home is on my back  
Lonely hobo lullaby is my song  
Lonely hobo lullaby gets me along  
My shoes my coat my jeans  
And anything else I own  
We're a family without a tree  
No roots to hold us down

Saturday night I was downtown  
Working for the FBI  
Sitting in a nest of bad men  
Whiskey bottles piling high  
  
Bootlegging boozer on the west side  
Full of people who are doing wrong  
Just about to call up the DA man  
When I heard this woman singing a song  
  
A pair of moneybags made me open my eyes  
My temperature started to rise  
  
She was a long cool woman in a black dress  
Just a 5'9" beautiful 'n' tall  
Just one look I was a bad mess  
'Cause that long cool woman had it all  
  
I saw her heading to the table  
Well, a tall walking big black cat  
Charlie said, "I hope that you're able, boy  
'Cause I'm telling you she knows where it's at"  
  
Suddenly we hear the sirens  
Everybody started to run  
Jumping under doors and tables  
Well, I heard somebody shooting a gun  
  
Well, the DA was pumping my left hand  
She was holding my right  
Well, I told her, "Don't get scared  
'Cause you're gonna be spared  
I'm gonna be forgiven if I wanna spend my living"  
  
With a long cool woman in a black dress  
Just a 5'9" beautiful 'n' tall  
Just one look I was a bad mess  
'Cause that long cool woman had it all  
She had it all, she had it all, she had it all  
She had it all  
  
You got it all, you got it all, you got it all  
You got it all, got it all, got it all, got it all  
Pretty long cool woman had it all

Look at life, take a look around you  
Look at life, doesn't it astound you  
See the colors of the sky  
Watch the colors of a rainbow  
We're so lucky, you and I  
Look at life  
  
It's there for us  
So why don't we use it  
Four seasons of the year  
All you do is choose it  
  
Warm summers bring the sun,  
And with the falling leaves the autumn  
All the new things come with spring  
Look at life  
  
Warm summers bring the sun,  
And with the falling leaves we get the autumn,  
The autumn  
  
You see a young boy pick a flower  
Why does he do it  
He picks it for the one he loves  
That's why he does it  
  
He sees the colors of the sky,  
Watches the colors of a rainbow  
We're so lucky, you and I  
Look at life  
  
Look at life Look at life Look at life

Raised him on the banks of the river-bed  
A houseboat tied to a big tall tree  
A home for my Papa and my Mama and me  
The clock strikes three, Papa jumps to his feet  
Already Mama's cookin' Papa somethin' to eat  
At half past, Papa, he's a-ready to go

Takes every bit of the night and day  
To even reachthe place where the people stay  
  
I can hardly wait till tomorrow comes around

Papa promised me that I could go  
He'd even let me see a cowboy show  
I'd seen the cowboys and Indians for the first time then  
Told my Papagotta go again

We'd come back again 'cause there's work to be done"

Love makes the world go round and around  
Love makes the world go round and around  
Love makes you feel three feet off the ground  
Love makes the world go round  
  
You should know it's happened before  
You should have known what was in store  
You should know not to do it encore  
You should have known before  
  
You did it your way it never worked out  
Mr Right turned out Mr Wrong  
You won't change your ways because you believe  
In love is where you belong  
  
You did it your way it never worked out  
Mr Right turned out Mr Wrong  
You won't change your ways because you believe  
In love is where you belong  
  
Can't you see, love's thrown out of the door  
Can't you see, no-one loves anymore  
Can't you see, my world's on the floor  
Without love can the world go round  
And around, and around, and around, and around  
Without love, without love, can the world go round, yeah

There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm  
Or led a lion through a busy street bazaar  
There are many things I'd like to turn you on to  
But somehow I feel you're safer where you are  
  
If you're looking for examples to refer to  
Take a look around yourself I'm sure you'll find  
There are many things to make your life much brighter  
And I'd bet there's many more inside your mind  
  
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
There's a man I know with no expression no not none at all  
  
But I've never seen this man laughing  
And come to think of it I've never seen him cry  
But I might by sitting hear him singing  
By and by he'll stop and sigh  
He'll feel a breeze and then begin to freeze  
As he thinks goodbye  
  
Have you ever ridden horses through a rainstorm

Maybe baby, I'll have you  
Maybe baby, you'll be true  
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me  
  
It's funny honey, you don't care  
You never listen to my prayer  
Maybe baby, I'll have you for me  
  
Well, you are the one that makes me glad  
And you are the one that makes me sad  
When someday you want me, oh well,  
I'll be there, wait and see

Out of the sky the rain comes driving down  
Washing away the hills of darkest brown  
Heading out through another country town  
White lace curtains  
  
Something certainly gets into me  
Call it jealousy  
And when I'm so far away  
Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway  
  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere above the night  
And maybe you've gone your way  
And I'll go my way  
  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere inside the night  
Maybe it's dawn  
Out of my heart my love comes falling free  
  
Healing the pain that burns you and me  
Heading towards another warm country  
Smiles are dancing shades entrancingly  
Gets into me  
  
Call it fantasy  
And when I'm so far away  
Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway  
Somewhere inside me  
  
Somewhere above the night  
And maybe you've gone your way  
And I've gone my way  
Somewhere inside me  
  
Somewhere inside the night  
Somewhere the light shines bright along the highway  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere above the night  
  
And maybe you've gone your way  
And I've gone my way  
Somewhere inside me  
Somewhere inside the night  
  
And maybe it's dawn  
In the city where I'll be  
Maybe it's dawn  
When you're near me

You came to me one summer night  
And from your beam you made my dream  
Woah let me tell you now  
And from the world you sent my girl  
And from above you sent love  
  
Now she is mine  
I think you'll find  
Because she loves you  
Mr Moonlight  
  
Mr Moonlight  
Come and again please

Ooh my love, ooh ooh my love  
Please don t take my advances too lightly  
Don't be hasty, let the feelin' come straight from your heart  
You've been burned too many times before  
Accept my love I'm gonna give it to you  
Please don't forsake it and take it and make it my love  
I can see what you're thinkin' but I won't let you down  
Let your love show and don't think of the past  
Come tomorrow you'll be happy with the feeling you've found

And if you should want to throw it all away,

When I was a kid I had a rocking horse  
Rocking to and fro, high and low  
Where we'd go no one'd know  
  
Thousands of tin soldiers were at my command  
Dressed in red dressed in blue  
Each command always followed through  
  
But now it's not that way at all  
No it's not that way at all  
  
Now I've changed and I have aged  
Left here with just memories  
How I wish to be young again  
  
But it's not that way at all  
No it's not that way at all  
  
No it's not that way at all  
No it's not that way at all  
No it's not that way at all  
No it's not that way at all  
  
When I was a kid I had a rocking horse  
Rocking to and fro, high and low  
Where we'd go no one'd know  
  
But it's not that way at all  
No it's not that way at all

Look at me  
I never thought that I would change  
Is destiny the one to blame  
for bringing me to you  
  
I can't turn back  
These feelings can't be sacrificed  
when we're so close to paradise  
It's made for me and you  
  
Nothing else but love  
could ever mean as much to me  
And every time you're next to me  
And how I realise  
that nothing else but love  
could touched my heart the way you do  
I know that I would be a fool if I did not believe  
  
in nothing else but love  
  
I never knew I'd a prisoner to a stranger's kiss  
but you got something that I can't resist  
And I got to be with you  
  
chorus  
  
This moment will shine on forever  
It will live beyond a shadow of a doubt  
This love was blessed by a southern sky  
Now it can never say die  
  
chorus  
  
in nothing else but love

Now's the time to say that we're through  
Now's the time because I'm through with you  
You treated me so bad  
What a time I had  
With you oh yeah times are bad times are bad  
  
I recall the times that used to be  
We went out together happily  
Then he came along  
I knew that it was wrong  
To treat me so oh yeah times are bad times are bad  
  
I miss the times  
I feel so blue Without you my heart  
It's just runaway  
  
Now's the time to say that we're through  
Now's the time because I'm through with you  
You treated me so bad  
What a time I had  
With you oh yeah times are bad times are bad  
  
  
I recall the times that used to be  
We went out together happily  
Then he came along  
I knew that it was wrong  
To treat me so oh yeah times are bad times are bad

Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you.  
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?  
  
Horses chasing 'cause they're racing.  
So they ain't so far.  
  
On a carousel, on a carousel.  
  
Nearer and nearer by changing horses, still so far away.  
People fighting for their places just get in my way.  
Soon you'll leave and then I'll lose you  
Still we're going round.  
  
On a carousel, on a carousel,  
round and round and round and round  
round and round and round and round with you.  
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too.  
  
As she leaves, she drops the presents that she won before.  
Pulling ducks out of the water, got the highest score.  
Now's my chance and I must take it, a case of do-or-die.  
  
On a carousel, on a carousel,  
round and round and round and round  
round and round and round and round with you.  
Up, down, up, down, up, down, too  
  
Riding along on a carousel, trying to catch up to you.  
Riding along on a carousel, will I catch up to you?  
  
Now we take our ride together  
No more chasing her.  
  
On a carousel, on a carousel

Open up your eyes looking at the people  
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smiling  
Open up your eyes looking at the people  
Wouldn't it be nice if they were always smiling smiling  
  
Wake in the morning  
Look out of my window  
Down on the street as the people pass by  
Wonderful faces awake but asleep  
Rushing around with appointments to keep  
Rushing around with appointments to keep  
  
Bald-headed banker with bowler on head  
Credit for debit but still in the red  
Schoolgirl in pigtails and freckly nose  
Trying to remember her Latin prose  
Trying to remember her Latin prose  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
Isn't it surprising what you'll find  
  
Open up your eyes open up your eyes  
What are they thinking  
What's on their minds  
Are they all looking for something to find  
Decreasing circles running around  
Searching for something they've already found  
Searching for something they've already found  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open up your eyes looking at the people

How soon tears begin to tumble  
From her laughing eyes  
She's been talking to somebody  
Who told her lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
Who told her lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
  
How can I begin to reach her  
Let her know the truth  
What that someone has been saying  
Is only lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
It's only lies  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
  
How could she think that I  
Would take advantage of a girl like her  
How could she think that I  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
  
Like a flower she is fading  
Soon she'll wilt and die  
If she doesn't get the sunlight  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
  
How could she think that I  
Would take advantage of a girl like her  
How could she think that I  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
Would sacrifice all I have felt for her  
  
Like a flower she is fading  
Soon she'll wilt and die  
If she doesn't get the sunlight  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more  
That I can give  
She'll never trust in anybody no more

Too many people need me  
I've got so much  
So much to do  
But when my traveling is over  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest  
It seems unfair to leave you  
And sell myself the way I do.  
But when my wandering is over  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest  
Most of my life I've been moving  
And when I tire out I'll come home to you.  
But until then I'll be waiting  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest  
How cold is my room, (How cold is my room)  
Without your love beside me?  
We look at the same old moon (Looking at the moon)  
But you're not here beside me  
I'll pay you back with interest  
I'll pay you back with interest

(holly)  
Please don't tell, no, no, no.  
Please don't tell I told you so.  
I just heard a rumor from a friend.  
I don't say that it's true.  
I'll just leave that up to you.  
If you don't believe, I'll understand.  
Do you recall a girl that's been in nearly every song?  
This is what I heard. of course, the story could be wrong.  
She's the one, I've been told,  
'cause she's wearing that band of gold.  
Peggy sue got married not long ago.

Evening, I see the sun  
Leaving today  
Cool night, mellow light  
Don't fade away  
Your eyes, paradise  
What do they say  
Leaving, loving  
Stay one more day  
And after all the tears have fallen my way  
You'd think that we could never feel the same  
Love is strange  
Pick up the pieces again  
Long time, friend of mine  
Words of farewell  
Love is, the learning  
I knew you well  
And after all the tears have fallen my way  
You'd think that we could never feel the same  
Love is strange  
Pick up the pieces again  
Pick up the pieces  

Please don't feel too bad because I'm leaving.  
I'm coming home again to you.  
And when I go away, I know you're grieving  
Although you know that I'll be true.  
  
I'm wondering what to do to make you know you're mine.  
I'll take you in my arms and then all will be fine.  
And when I'm away from you, you know I'll miss you.  
I want to feel your tender touch.  
  
And when I'm feeling blue, I want to kiss you.  
I stay away from you too much.  
I'm wondering what to do to make you know you're mine.  
I'll take you in my arms and then all will be fine.  
  
And when I'm away from you, you know I'll miss you.  
I want to feel your tender touch.  
And when I'm feeling blue, I want to kiss you.  
I stay away from you too much.  
  
Whoa whoa yeah, too much  
Yeah yeah yeah, too much  
Whoa whoa whoa, too much

When sand's close at hand  
And the sea is touching me,  
I feel much happier  
Than I've ever felt. and a long time goes by  
And I'm floating in the sky.  
And I wish you could be,  
Wish you could be here.  
  
And if you're free, follow me  
Throw a pebble in my sea.  
The sun will wrap you up  
In a pool of gold, and lights in the night  
In the night reaching neon waves of sight.  
  
But  
I wish you could be,  
Wish you could be,  
Wish you could be here.  
  
The sun, the sand, the sea are waiting  
On the corner. Take a trip out here.  
Hustle, bustle, shove and fuss  
Will greet you if you stay there.  
I'm without a care.  
  
Fresh fruit and sea fish,  
Are in abundance here.  
But they don't allow  
The natives at your door  
Selling booze  
Smuggled from another shore.  
  
And

I've been runnin' through the night  
Tryin' to reach and hold you tight  
I've been wonderin' just why you stayed away  
But when I reached your home  
I found out that you had gone  
I found out someone had taken you away  
Ever since the day I cared all my dream we've shared  
And my love for you grown stronger every day  
And now you've said good-bye all I do is cry  
I've been wonderin' just why you went away

Won't you come on back to my side  
Please oh please don't hurt my pride  
Tryin' to get along without you ain't so good  
And if you play along I will say that I was wrong  
'Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should  
'Cause my love for you grows stronger like it should

Back street dive down in New Orleans  
Gambler shows his face  
The place was full of jacks and queens  
But I never came up with that bread-winning ace  
Whisky's cheap at twice the price  
When it kills the pain of bad tumbling dice  
The scene's all set for an IOU  
Give it one more spin then that's me I'm through  
The wheel's like a chamber in Russian roulette  
I'm takin' a chance and I'm gunnin' for red  
The wheel's like a chamber in Russian roulette  
I'm takin' a chance and I'm gunnin' for red  
Lost my shirt headed for the bar  
Gonna drown my sorrows in a whisky jar  
Head hung low because I got beat  
I see a hundred dollar bill layin' at my feet  
chorus  
Headed for the tables I'm wearin' my shades  
Got to find me a lucky green top,  
Can't be one I've played  
My hands are shakin' don't wanna lose my cool  
Should I keep the big see or gamble like a fool?

Those pier lights our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight for I may never see you again  
Hey sandy girl my baby  
  
Sandy the fireworks are hailin' over little eden tonight  
Forcin' a light into all those stony faces left stranded on this warm july  
And the boys from the casino dance with their shirts open like latin lovers on
the shore  
Chasin' all those silly new york virgins by the score  
  
Sandy the aurora is risin' behind us  
Those pier lights our carnival life forever  
Oh love me tonight and I promise I'll love you forever  
Oh I mean it sandy girl oh my baby  
Hey sandy girl my baby  
  
Sandy the waitress I was seein' lost her desire for me  
I spoke with her last night she said she won't set herself on fire for me

For me this boardwalk life is through you ought to quit this scene too

Thinking about you  
How it would be  
If I could live without you  
Something I just can't seem to visualise  
When I look into your eyes  
I only hear the words I want to hear  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
  
Let me live a fantasy  
Gotta lie to me won't you please  
Say that you're mine  
Deep inside me  
I hear a warning voice  
Speak softly to me  
Asking how I could ever be so blind  
I've been trying to read your mind  
Why don't you say the words I want to hear  
Why don't you  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
  
Doing all I can to make you see  
Ooh, baby what you do to me  
Don't you know my heart's in jeopardy  
The effect you havin' over me  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever  
You don't have to tell the truth  
But I want you to  
Say that you're mine  
Say that you'll be mine  
For ever and ever

Life ain't worth a-livin'  
People just been givin' me  
Friendship happiness is what everybody deserves  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I don't have to ask for everything I get  
Everyone just lets me down  
Tries to make me look like a fool  
Won't accept me for what I am  
They say I got to live by the rules  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I don't have to ask for everything I get  
It's gotta end sometime  
How's it gonna be yeah  
Are we wrong or are we right  
It's gotta end sometime  
Calling you and me yeah  
It's gonna take a long long time  
  
Seems like they don't give a damn  
Won't let me live just how I want  
They say I'm a down-and-out  
But it's them that's wrong  
But she gives me everything I want  
  
Oh I don't have to ask for everything I get  
  
Verse 3  
  
Cos' she gives me everything I want (We don't need nobody else)

Just another room  
Just another town  
Same old crazy people hanging around  
Still you shine silently  
  
Staring into space  
Comin' down alone  
Feel like packin' all my bags  
And running home  
Shine silently  
  
Shine shine silently  
I don't need no light in the darkness  
Shine silently  
No I won't get lost while your loves shines  
Shines on me shines on me  
  
People at the door  
People on the phone  
Same old story  
No time on my own  
Still shine silently  
  
Nothing left to say  
Nothing left to prove  
When it's said and done  
There's nothing left but you babe  
Shine silently

Shine shine silently  
I don't need no light in the darkness  
Shine silently  
No I won't get lost while your loves shines
