Is the sun in your eyes, easy rider?  
Do the flame colored skies light your fire?  
We are heavy metal lions, they will never understand  
The kind of people you or I am, bow your heads and take your hands  
  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
Does the ocean inspire, easy rider?  
Do the stars and the wind take you higher?  
You are California proud, you are angels of the night  
Rock 'n' roll guardians now, the last keepers of the light  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
Paradise is a hell colored flame sky  
Is it nice to feel free and wild?  
Paradise is the game of do or die  
I just ride, ride, ride  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels  
They were angels forever, forever angels

Baby when I'm sleeping  
It feels less like I am dreaming

A feeling real bad

I try to quiet  
Thoughts in the night  
Oh they got me thinking  
I'll be happier just drinking

It's got me down  
On my knees

You drive up in a summer sky, blue bentley  
Death reflect detecting in his eyes  
Thought about all the women who loved me  
I said, "oh no!"  
He said, "get inside"  
I said, "oh no!"  
He said, "get inside"  
  
I got into his summer sky, blue bentley  
Sun reflect detecting in my eyes  
Thought about all the fun I had lately  
I said, "Uh huh" I said "I want to drive"  
I said, "Uh huh I want, I want to drive"  
We drive, We drive  
  
You say you wanna go swimming in my ring  
It's green and shimmering  
Like my lipstick, the colour of dawn  
Like my lipstick, the colour of dawn  
We got out of his summer sky, blue bentley  
  
Death reflect detecting in the sky  
He held my hand to the ocean he lead me  
I said, "uh huh, I want, I want to die"  
"Uh huh, I want, I want to die."

I told you not to go into the woods,  
I told you that he wasn't any good.  
I told you not to go into the woods,  
I told you that he wasn't any good.  
  
I'll take the wrong path,  
I think I'll go a little off track.  
And now there's no way back,  
You took all the apples that I had.  
But I heart you and I wanna be your girl.  
I heart you and I know you'll rock my world.  
  
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock  
You know that I want what you got.  
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock  
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up.  
(I told you not to go into the woods)  
  
Big, bad, naughty rock star  
Your claws are shining bright in the dark.  
Lifting up my little red skirt,  
I know you'll leave me here in the dirt.  
But I heart you, and I wanna be your girl  
I heart you, so come back and rock my world!  
  
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock  
You know that I want what you got.  
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock

Life is like, like a little game,  
That we like to play, just for fun, just for fun  
Yeah, we take nothing seriously, nothing's wrong, make me run, all night long.  
Hide and seek is how you play with me,  
Oh, you're tempting me, just for fun, just for fun.  
I hear you calling me over city streets, through the trees, mess with me, then
you'll leave.  
Oh, be still my heart, escaping in your cherry red car.  
  
(X2:)  
'Cause you rock, rock, rock, rock, rock  
You know that I want what you got.  
You rock, rock, rock, rock, rock  
Big bad wolf come on and eat me up, up, up

With your big eyes  
And your big lies  
With your big eyes  
And your big lies  
  
I saw you creeping around the garden  
What are you hiding?  
I beg your pardon don't tell me "nothing"  
I used to think that I could trust you  
I was your woman  
You were my knight and shining companion  
To my surprise my loves demise was his own greed and lullaby  
  
With your big eyes, and your big lies  
With your big eyes, and your big lies  
  
I noticed you got hot in summer you had no comfort  
Your shirt was cotton your face was sunburned  
You paced around like you'd been waiting  
Waiting for something  
Your world was burning and I stood watching  
As I looked on the flames grew high you watched me frown  
I said "goodbye"  
  
With your big eyes, and your big lies  
With your big eyes, and your big lies  
  
Is it me was I wrong to have trusted you  
Did I see what I wanted, what wasn't true?  
Was I wrong to go on like a little fool?  
It's amazing what women in love will do  
  
With your big eyes  
And your big lies  
With your big eyes  
And your big lies

I paint my nails black  
I dye my hair a darker shade of brown  
'Cause you like your women spanish, dark, strong and proud  
I paint the sky black  
You said if you could have your way  
You'd make it nighttime all today  
So it'd suit the mood with your song  
  
Oh, what can I do?  
Nothing, my sparrow blue  
Oh, what can I do  
Life is beautiful  
But you don't have a clue  
Sun and ocean blue  
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you  
  
Black beauty  
Oh x2  
  
I paint the house black  
My wedding dress black leather too  
You have no room for light  
Love is lost on you  
I keep my lips red  
They seem like cherries in the spring  
Darling you can't let everything seem so dark blue  
  
But oh, what can I do?  
Nothing, my sparrow blue  
Oh, what can I do  
Life is beautiful  
But you don't have a clue  
Sun and ocean blue  
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you  
  
Oh x5  
Black beauty baby x2  
  
Oh, what can I do  
Life is beautiful  
But you don't have clue  
Sun and ocean blue  
Their magnificence, it don't make sense to you  
  
Black beauty  
Oh x4

Blue jeans  
White shirt  
Walked into the room you know you made my eyes burn  
It was like, James Dean, for sure  
Your so fresh to death and sick as ca-ca-cancer  
You were sorta punk rock, I grew up on air pop  
But you fit me better than my favorite sweater, and I know  
That love is mean, and love hurts  
But I still remember that day we met in December, oh baby  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
Big dreams  
Gangster  
Said you had to leave to start your life over  
I was like "no please", stay here  
We don't need no money we can make it all work  
But he headed out on Sunday, said he'd come home Monday  
I stayed up waitin, anticipatin' and pacin', but he was  
Chasin' paper  
Caught up in the game, that was the last I heard  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time  
  
You went out every night  
An' baby that's all right  
I told you that no matter what you did I'd be by your side  
Cause I'm a ride or die  
Whether you fail or fly  
Well shit at least you tried  
But when you walked out that door  
A piece of me died  
Told you I wanted more  
That's not what I had in mind  
Just want it like before  
We were dancin' all night  
Then they took you away  
Stole you out of my life  
You just need to remember  
  
I will love you till the end of time  
I would wait a million years  
Promise you'll remember that your mine  
Baby can you see through the tears  
Love you more  
Than those bitches before  
Say you'll remember oh baby say you'll remember  
Oh baby ooh  
I will love you till the end of time

She wore blue velvet  
Bluer than velvet was the night  
Softer than satin was the light  
From the stars  
  
She wore blue velvet  
Bluer than velvet were her eyes  
Warmer than may her tender sighs  
Love was ours  
  
Ours a love I held tightly  
Feeling the rapture grow  
Like a flame burning brightly  
But when she left, gone was the glow of  
  
She wore blue velvet  
But in my heart there'll always be  
Precious and warm a memory, through the years  
And I still can see blue velvet through my tears

My oh me, my  
Feet don't fail me now  
Take me to your finish line  
Oh my heart it breaks every step that I take  
But I'm hoping that the gates, they'll tell me that you're mine  
Walking through the city streets  
Is it by mistake or design  
I feel so alone on a Friday night  
Can you make me feel like home if I tell you you're mine  
  
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why  
Keep making me laugh,  
Lets go get high  
The road is long, we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane,  
So choose your last words, this is the last time  
Cause you and I, we were born to die  
  
Lost but now I am found  
I can see but once I was blind  
I was so confused as a little child  
Tried to take what I could get  
Scared that I couldn't find  
All the answers honey  
  
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why  
Keep making me laugh,  
Lets go get high  
The road is long, we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane,  
Choose your last words, this is the last time  
Cause you and I, we were born to die  
We were born to die  
We were born to die  
  
Come and take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
  
Don't make me sad, don't make me cry  
Sometimes love is not enough and the road gets tough I don't know why  
Keep making me laugh  
Lets go get high  
The road is long, we carry on  
Try to have fun in the meantime  
  
Come take a walk on the wild side  
Let me kiss you hard in the pouring rain  
You like your girls insane  
Choose your last words, this is the last time  
Cause you and I, we were born to die (We were born to die)

Every Saturday night I get dressed up to ride for you, baby  
Cruising down the street on Hollywood and Vine for you, baby  
I drive fast, wind in my hair, push it to the limits 'cause I just don't care  
You ask me where I've been?

Santa Monica, I'm racing in the lights for you, baby

Your hands were on my hips, your name is on my lips  
Over over again, like my only prayer

Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem  
Lying to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf  
It's alarming honestly how charming she can be  
Fooling everyone, telling them she's having fun  
  
She says you don't want to be like me  
Don't wanna see all the things I've seen  
I'm dying, I'm dying  
She says you don't want to get this way  
Famous and dumb at an early age  
Lying, I'm lying  
  
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen  
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes  
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond  
Audio tune lies, she's still shining  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Carmen, Carmen, staying up 'til morning  
Only seventeen, but she walks the streets so mean  
It's alarming truly how disarming you can be  
Eating soft ice cream, Coney Island queen  
  
She says you don't want to be like me  
Looking for fun, getting high for free  
I'm dying, I'm dying  
  
She says you don't want to get this way  
Street walk at night and a star by day  
  
It's tiring, tiring  
  
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen  
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes  
She laughs like God, her mind's like a diamond  
Audio tune lies, she's still shining  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Baby's all dressed up with nowhere to go  
That's the little story of the girl you know  
Relying on the kindness of strangers  
Tying cherry knots, smiling, doing party favors  
Put your red dress on, put your lipstick on  
Sing your song, song, now, the camera's on  
And you're alive again  
  
Mon amour, je sais que tu m'aimes aussi  
Tu as besoin de moi  
Tu as besoin de moi dans ta vie  
Tu ne peux vivre sans moi  
Et je mourrais sans toi  
Je tuerais pour toi  
  
The boys, the girls, they all like Carmen  
She gives them butterflies, bats her cartoon eyes  
She laughs like god, her mind's like a diamond  
Audio tune lies, she's still shining  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Like lightning, light, like lightning  
  
Darling, darling, doesn't have a problem  
Lying to herself 'cause her liquor's top shelf

Take me in your fast car mercedes  
Kissing on your neck while you're driving  
Doesn't care I'm always on my blackberry  
All the time all the time buying into every line  
I'mma flashy little lush but he thinks I'm really fine  
Notorious and wild takes me where I'm gonna shine  
Where the bad boys roll hard dressing like james dean  
And the vixen starlets feels so good to be  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is the only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We gonna get free free free free  
Free free free get free  
  
(Lana del rey)  
Baby we are chancers on the scene  
Grammar in the cutters only so arctic  
See graffiti artists and tabloid queen  
Mix it up, mix it up  
Every dude you ever seen  
We're acting really tough  
Like the world belongs to us  
Cause it does, yeah it must  
But we do create the buzz  
Where the bad boys blow smoke  
Just like they're james dean  
And the air girls blow kisses  
Just like marilyn  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is the only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We gonna get free free free free  
Free free free get free  
  
(Lana del rey)  
Run for your lives  
They got 'em in chains  
Let's hope that we merge  
Create our own games  
Dj's, rockstars, posers, we are  
Then the politicians  
That surrender the additions  
And it's so pornographic and it's tragic  
Nothing magic makes us free  
To be what we wanna be, wanna be  
  
[Chorus:]  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is our only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We're children of the bad revolution  
And partying is our only solution  
And I'mma tell any confusion  
About who we are and what we're gonna be  
We gonna get free free free free  
Free free free get free  
We gonna get freed

Everything I want I have  
Money, notoriety, rivieras  
I even think I found God  
In the flash bulbs of your pretty cameras,  
Pretty cameras, pretty cameras  
Am I glamorous, baby am I glamorous  
  
Hello, hello!  
Can you hear me?  
I can be your china doll  
If you wanna see me fall  
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly  
Tell me life is beautiful, they all think I have it all  
I've nothing without you  
All my dreams and all the lights mean  
Nothing without you  
  
Summertime is nice and hot  
And my life is sweet like vanilla is  
Gold and silver line my heart  
But burned into to my brain all these stolen images  
Stolen images, baby stolen images  
Can you picture this  
What a life we could've lived  
  
Hello hello!  
Can you hear me?  
I can be your china doll  
If you wanna see me fall  
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly  
Tell me life is beautiful they all say I have it all  
I've nothing without you  
All my dreams and all the lights mean  
Nothing without you  
  
We were two kids just tryin to get out  
Live on the dark side of the american dream  
We would stay out late, play our music loud  
When we grew up nothing was what it seemed  
  
Hello hello!  
Can you hear me?  
I can be your china doll  
If you wanna see me fall  
Boy you're so dope, your love is deadly  
Tell me life is beautiful they think that I have it all  
I've nothing without you  
All my dreams and all the lights mean  
Nothing without you

All my friends tell me I should move on  
I'm lying in the ocean, singing your song  
Ah, that's how you sing it  
Loving you forever, can't be wrong  
Even though you're not here, won't move on  
Ah, that's how we play it  
  
And there's no remedy for memory your face  
Like a melody, it won't leave my head  
Your soul is haunting me and telling me  
That everything is fine  
But I wish I was dead  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
It's like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes  
It's like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
  
All my friends ask me why I stay strong  
Tell 'em when you find true love it lives on  
Ah, that's why I stay here

Your soul is haunting me and telling me  
That everything is fine  
But I wish I was dead  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
It's like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes  
It's like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
But there's no you, except in my dreams tonight  
  
Oh oh oh, ha ha ha  
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight  
Oh oh oh, ha ha ha  
I don't wanna wake up from this tonight  
  
There's no relief, I see you in my sleep  
And everybody's rushing me, but I can feel you touching me  
There's no release, I feel you in my dreams  
Telling me I'm fine  
  
Every time I close my eyes  
It's like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you  
I'm scared that you won't be waiting on the other side  
Every time I close my eyes  
It's like a dark paradise  
No one compares to you

Maybe this weed it brings me closer  
I could sparkle up your eye

Platinum and felt acrylics  
Skim the paper for the critics  
Baby's printing Elvis lyrics  
On the copper bar  
  
Late, Motel lounge is singin'  
Spotlight on the band that's swingin'  
Chateau Marmont memories fading  
Hope is very far  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most?  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back, his head relaxing  
Thank you very much and I'm laughing  
All my chantilly lace catchin'  
Baby, on the chandelier  
  
Sweeping scents and blue hydrangia  
Summer hail and summer stranger  
Baby, he's in constant danger  
Help is very far  
  
You look like a Florida Native  
Are you? I said, at the rate of  
Slow molasses from the State of  
Vermont with the Southern drawl  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most?  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back, his head relaxing  
Thank you very much and I'm laughing  
All my chantilly lace is catchin'  
On the chandelier  
  
He said he come to welcome warn me  
Gesture diamond to adorn me  
Come to be and see the one and only  
For my final year  
Well thank you  
  
Elvis where are you when I need you most  
White comp sequin jumpsuit ghost  
Pick me up and make a toast  
Champagne in the air  
  
Tipping back, his head relaxing  
Thank you very much an' I'm laughing  
All my chantilly lace is catchin'  
On that chandelier  
  
It's catchin' on that chandelier [x2]  
  
Where are you when I need you most?

White lines, pretty baby, tattoos  
Don't know what they mean, they're special, just for you  
White palms, baking powder on the stove  
Cooking up a dream, turning diamonds into snow  
  
I feel you, pretty baby, feel me  
Turn it up hot, loving you is free  
I like it down, like it down way low  
But you already know that  
You already know  
  
Come on down to Florida  
I got something for ya  
We could see the kilos on the keys, baby, oh ya  
Gourds in the summertime  
Chic-a-Cherry Cola lime  
Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my s-  
  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
And all the dope fiends  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
  
Zoom in my miles and gold hoops  
You like your little baby like you like your drinks, cool  
White lines, pretty daddy, go skiing  
You snort it like a champ, like the winner when I'm in it...  
  
Come on down to Florida  
I got something for ya  
We could see the kilos on the keys, baby, oh ya  
Gourds in the summertime

Prison isn't nothing to me if you'll be by my s-  
  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
And all the dope fiends  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
  
We could get high in Miami or dance the night away  
Even when I die in Miami, that's what they all say  
(You believe me, don't you baby?)  
  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
And all the dope fiends  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
And all the Floridians say  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
All the Columbians say  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
And all my girlfriends  
Yayo, yayo, yayo  
  
That's how I do it  
Come on, pretty baby  
White lines, pretty baby  
Gold teeth, pretty baby  
Dance the night away

All these feelings  
I'm tired of them  
Ruined all of my life again  
Emotions aren't my friend  
I gave keep ordered as best I can  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
How about the weather?  
  
All these people  
I'm tired of them  
Sifting into my life again  
Their questions, the how and when  
I try and answer the best that I can  
  
[Chorus:]  
But I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
How about the weather?  
  
All my worries, they come and go  
They tend to leave when I let you know  
On bad days I take it slow  
I try to dance when I hit a low  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
It will all get better  
  
All the days, they go so fast  
I can't believe what is in my past  
The future's here at last  
I don't need to have what she has  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
It will all get better  
  
Sing it out  
Sing it loud  
Sing it loud  
Sing it loud  
Be proud, come out  
Be proud, come out  
  
[Chorus:]  
I can, you can  
We can, who can  
Keep it all together  
Hit man, burn man  
His man, her man  
We can make it better  
  
We will have it better

30 blocks to Fordham Road,  
That's a bad neighborhood,  
Gray house on the corner,  
I know I shouldn't do what it is I could.  
The stone Mary in the garden,  
She let me know she watching,  
She said I better get walking,  
I better walk away.  
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay,  
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way,  
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,  
I'm just gonna walk,  
I'm gonna walk away.  
I catch a dollar in the wind and I buy a cup of coffee,  
There's a place on Valentine that still charge ninety cent.  
I keep on walking in the daytime and in my eyes it's always night time,  
And I like it when it's me at night,  
'Cause that's when all the stars come out.  
I don't know why it is that I wanna stay,  
I don't know what it is that makes me feel this way,  
But I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,  
I'm just gonna walk,  
I'm gonna walk away.  
It's the greatest,  
It's the greatest day.  
It's the greatest,  
It's the greatest day.  
I'm not gonna do what I hear me say,  
I'm just gonna walk,  
I'm gonna walk away.

[Verse 1]  
Life is awesome, I confess,  
What I do, I do best.  
You got nothing, I got tested,  
And I passed, yes.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lay me down tonight,  
In my linen and curls.  
Lay me down tonight,  
Riviera girls.  
  
[Chorus]  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
This is my show.  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
Go baby, go.  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
This is my show.  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
This is my show.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm a dragon,  
You're a whore,  
Don't even know what you're good for.  
Mimicking me is a fucking bore,  
To me.  
But babe.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Lay me down tonight,  
In my diamonds and pearls.  
Tell me songs at night,  
About your favourite girl.  
  
[Chorus]  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
This is my show.  
I fucked my way up to the top,

Lay me down tonight,  
I'm your favourite girl.  
  
[Chorus]  
I fucked my way up to the top,  
This is my show.

This is my show  
(Go, go, go, go, go)  
  
[Outro]  
Need you baby, like I breathe you baby,  
Need you baby, more, more, more, more  
Need you baby, like I breathe you baby,

I've been missing you, have you been missing me?  
Thinking 'bout your loving, 'bout your loving, sweet, sweet

Are you back in Greenwich dropping acid?  
Are you at the archive, watching television?  
Did you leave for Battery with your weed?  
And your leather lookin' like Greg Kinnear?  
Are you still the king of Rock 'n' Roll, babe?  
  
Bet you miss hearing me sing, calling me Lana  
And did you take your run today  
Along that west side highway?  
Do you miss your baby mama? Blue hydrangea  
Will my forever love never come back to me?  
Does it feel like yesterday to you, yet?  
  
How quickly you forget how I made you smile  
I remember everything  
The diamond horseshoe, wedding ring, and the tire light  
Blue hydrangea  
Will my forever love never return to me?

Heavy metal love of mine, I should have learned to let you stay  
You didn't want me all the time, but you were worth it anyway  
  
Cause you were so much better  
Than the rest of them  
Out of all the others  
You were the honest man  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
Motorcycle love divine  
I should have learned to let you play  
I wasn't the marrying kind  
I should have done it anyway  
We should have left Las Vegas and then began again  
To kill? Back to the promised land  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
I can feel it coming in the island tonight  
...  
Turning tan in...  
I can see you bathing in the sun light  
You got game boy,  
Game boy, game boy  
You got game boy game boy,  
Game boy  
You got game  
  
He loved guns and roses,  
Guns and roses  
He loved guns and roses,  
He loved guns  
And roses, roses, roses  
  
Roses

Our kind of love,  
It was once in a lifetime.  
It couldn't last,  
It was doomed from the first time.  
  
And you were 50's cool,  
In blue suede shoes,  
But it was a cover for,  
All of the trouble,  
You got into.  
  
I always fall for the wrong guy,  
Things that are bad always taste nice,  
That's what girls like me do, lose you.  
  
Don't tell me it's over!  
Don't tell me it's over!  
  
Hollywood's dead,  
Elvis is crying,  
Vicious in flames,  
Roland is dying.  
  
And in the light, you're,  
Sickeningly beautiful.  
Say goodbye, you're,  
Sickeningly beautiful.  
  
This kind of life,  
Wasn't meant for the good girl.  
Try as I might,  
In the end it's a cruel world.  
  
And you are living proof,  
Sinatra aloof,  
That you were an actor,  
Who only went after,  
The ones who swooned.  
  
I always fall for the same type,  
Gangsters in Vegas on game night,  
That's what girls like me like,  
The limelight.  
  
Don't tell me it's over!  
Don't tell me it's over!  
  
Hollywood's dead,  
Elvis is crying,  
Marilyn's sad,  
Hendrix is lying there.  
  
In the light, you're,  
Sickeningly beautiful.  
Say goodbye, you're,  
Sickeningly beautiful.  
  
If you should go,  
Before me then know,  
That I always loved you,  
There's no one above you, baby.  
  
Don't tell me it's over!  
Don't tell me it's over!  
  
Hollywood's dead,  
Elvis is crying,  
Lennon wake up,  
Cobain stop lying there.  
  
In the light, you're,  
Sickeningly beautiful.  
Say goodbye, you're,  
Sickeningly beautiful.  
  
Say goodnight, you're,  
So beautiful!  
  
Hollywood's dead,  
Hollywood's dead,  
Hollywood's dead, yeah.  
Hollywood's dead,  
Hollywood's dead,  
Hollywood's dead, yeah.  
  
(Cut)!

[Verse 1]  
We both know that it's not fashionable to love me  
But you don't go 'cause truly there's nobody for you but me  
We could cruise to the blues - Wilshire Boulevard if we choose  
Or whatever you want to do, we make the rules  
  
[Chorus]  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Say you want me too  
Say you want me too  
Dark blue  
Dark blue  
  
[Verse 2]  
We both know the history of violence that surrounds you  
But I'm not scared, there's nothing to lose now that I've found you  
We could cruise to the news - Pico Poulevard in your used little bullet car if
we choose  
Mr. "Born to Lose"  
  
[Chorus]  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Say you want me too  
Say you want me too  
Dark blue  
Dark blue  
  
[Bridge]  
There are violets in your eyes  
There are guns that blaze around you  
There are roses in between my thighs  
And a fire that surrounds you  
It's no wonder every man in town  
Had neither fought nor found you  
Everything you do is elusive  
To even your honey dew  
  
[Chorus - Variation]  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
Our honeymoon  
  
[Interlude]  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, da, da, da, da  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, da, da, da  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, da, da, da, da, da, da  
  
[Outro]  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Dreaming away your life  
Hmm, hmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly  
  
I had bright wishes in the summer, I was bathing in sunlight  
I was painting in the garden like a ghost in Mid-July  
Running fast from something with my eyes wide like  
Saucers spinning in the sun  
  
I had a dream that I was fine  
I wasn't crazy, I was divine  
  
  
I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly  
  
Your lies were hard kisses in the summer  
I was dreaming of a lake  
Dreaming of the water where I'd rise like a Phoenix  
Or that [?] from the fire  
I've got things to tell you like I know that you're a liar  
  
I had a dream that I was fine  
I wasn't crazy, I was divine  
  
I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly  
  
Your words cut like a knife and butter  
I was fighting for my art  
Fighting with my lover, you had me so tied up  
Thinking there's no other  
Yeah, right  
Yeah, right  
  
I Can Fly  
You had me caged up like a bird in mid-summer  
You saw me waiting I was crazy on fire waiting to fly  
I Can Fly

He don't like no small things,  
Even riding around on tall dreams  
I don't wanna go  
He's a sweet baby, but he looks mean  
In his soft leather, in his blue jeans  
  
He got away, baby, he got away, oh, baby  
He got away with his words.  
They'd be like diamonds and pearls,  
They'd be like diamonds and pearls,  
He gives to his little favorite girls  
  
I don't wanna go, go home  
I don't wanna go, go home  
Baby, tonight  
Baby, tonight  
  
He don't like no spotlight,  
Stands real quiet in the moonlight  
  
He got away, oh, baby, he got away, oh, baby,  
He got away with those words.  
They'd be like diamonds and pearls,  
They'd be like diamonds and pearls,  
He gives to his little favorite girl  
  
I don't wanna go, go home  
I don't wanna go, go home  
Baby, tonight  
Baby, tonight  
  
Loving you isn't right,  
Black leather won't like the giving  
Loving you isn't right,  
It's original sin  
  
I don't wanna go, go home  
I don't wanna go, go, home  
Baby, tonight  
Baby, tonight  
  
I feel like I can do anything,  
Like I can do anything,  
Like I can do anything that I like  
I feel like I can do anything,  
Like I can do anything,  
Like I can do anything tonight  
Baby, tonight  
Tonight

What an unusual name you said  
What a spectacular letter  
You really seem like a prize, to me  
And you are so mysterious  
When you are notorious  
Oh what do you mean to me he said  
How do you know me so well?  
After only one night I, I, I, I had  
How do I love you, tell me  
Though in my mind  
I'm indebited to you, I'm indebited to you  
Always  
  
There's something he doesn't know about me  
A secret he doesn't show about  
A sensitive sign on his arm  
Oh my, ai, ai  
She got the skeletons dance when  
Some secrets he know she never tell  
People who keep her alone  
  
And she said, how did I know you so well  
Why am I not surprised?  
He said, baby go to hell and  
That will set demise of your love  
Don't ever pick up the man,  
If you don't think he'll understand  
Don't ever trust yourself if you  
Have a history of being a loving fool  
  
So that's what she got when she married him  
A lifetime promise to carry him  
Him and his every second of need  
I do not know him so well  
Not more than one night  
Do you still love me, oh tell me  
With all of your might  
I'm indebited to you, in indebited to you  
My lovea

I've been to Hollywood hills taking violet  
Pills writing all of my songs about with cheap friends  
You're a hard man to loving on  
A hard woman to keep track of  
You like to rage don't do that  
You want your way You make me so mad  
Got your gun I've gon' my day  
  
Is this happiness? [x4]  
  
I've been in Hollywood Hills scorching valley  
Pills you've been trying to write a novel  
'Bout your cheap fails  
You think you want the race  
But soon I think you're fucking crazy as day is long  
Man to man heart to heart  
I love you but you drive me so far  
Wish you well I'm that star  
  
Is this happiness? [x4]  
  
Which day is on  
Which day is on  
Betrayal

One gun on, don't take boy  
Hands short if  
Your rainbow  
  
Is this happiness? [x4]

His smile like a million roses bathed in rock 'n' roll  
Ours was the greatest love story ever told  
Throat like an angel with a voice that was made of gold  
That's my baby  
  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall  
A heart that would beat like a base for his baby doll  
One in a million, inimitable song  
That's my baby  
Young or old, summer or cold  
Young or old, summer or cold  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so erratic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
He was the king of the town with a crown that would never fall

Young or old, summer or cold  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it

And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so neurotic the way you see through that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy  
You've got it and I want it  
Wild summer nights in July, funny  
You know that you can always come home to the one who gave you your name  
'Cause I see a light in your eyes  
It's so bright and the skies, they open wide for you  
So come to me, my baby  
You've got a way like jfk  
When you pull it the way that you move it  
Spins me around like a record, baby  
And you've got a soul like no one I know  
You're so erratic the way you see through play that shit  
Breaks my heart and it drives me crazy  
It drives me crazy

I was born bad  
But then I met you  
You made me nice for a while  
But my dark side's true.  
  
You never cared what I did at all  
Motel singer at a silver ball  
I did what I had to do...  
  
Femme fatale, always on the run  
Diamonds on my wrist, whiskey on my tongue  
Before I give back, I gotta get drunk  
So get over here, pour me a cold one.  
  
Babe you can see that I'm danger  
Teetering off of the stage, yeah  
Sparkling in sequins, say hey-yeah  
  
Time to give in to the kindness of strangers.  
  
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?  
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.  
  
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?  
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck.  
  
Wrong, I know, killing someone  
It gets a little easier when you've done it once  
You know that I'm fun, you know that I'm young  
So tell me your mind, let's get it on.  
  
Babe you can see that I'm danger  
Glamorous, but I'm deranged, yeah  
Teetering off of the stage, yeah  
I said it really nicely so can you be my savior?  
  
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?  
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.

When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?  
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back, but I'm kinda outta luck.  
  
I was a dangerous girl  
You were too nice for this world  
And now I'm back on the prowl  
Who wants to give it a whirl?  
  
Is it wro-wrong that I think it's kinda fun  
When I hit you in the back of the head with a gun?  
My daddy's in the trunk of his brand new truck  
I really want him back, but I'm flat outta luck.

You should have let me know that I have no chance at all  
I can never be what you wanted  
Should let me know... still think about us  
You told me you was on it!  
Sometimes I wonder why, why I even bother  
Try to pull you out, boy!  
Should have let me know I would lose you to the drink  
  
Chorus:  
Lift your eyes, lift your eyes  
Just a little higher, just a little higher  
Lift those eyes, look into mine  
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you  
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes  
I know that you're scared to death  
Running out of breath  
I can hold you, hold you!  
  
You should have let me know,  
But you worked around the clock  
They try to live harder, yeah!  
You should have let me know,  
But you're afraid to love me  
You're looking like a liar!  
Sometimes I wonder why, why I even ask you  
But I do!  
  
Chorus:  
Lift your eyes, lift your eyes  
Just a little higher, just a little higher  
Lift those eyes, look into mine  
Cause I can guide you, I can guide you  
Lift those eyes, lift your eyes  
I know that you're scared to death  
Running out of breath  
But I can hold you, hold you!

Would you be mine?  
Would you be my baby tonight?  
Could be kissing my fruit punch lips in the bright sunshine  
Cause I like you quite a lot, everything you got  
Don't you know? It's you that I adore  
Though I make the boys fall like dominoes  
  
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight  
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)  
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight  
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)  
  
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!  
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play  
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!  
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay  
No more skipping rope  
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown  
Just you and me feeling the heat  
Even when the sun goes down  
  
I could be yours, I could be your baby tonight  
Topple you down from your sky 40 stories high  
Shining like a God, can't believe I caught you and so  
Look at what I bought, not a second thought - oh, Romeo  
  
Kiss me in the d-a-r-k dark tonight  
(D-a-r-k, do it my way)  
Kiss me in the p-a-r-k park tonight  
(P-a-r-k, let them all say)  
  
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!  
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play  
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!  
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay  
No more skipping rope  
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown  
Just you and me feeling the heat  
Even when the sun goes down  
  
I want my cake and I want to eat it too  
I want to have fun and be in love with you  
I know that I'm a mess with my long hair  
And my suntan, short dress, bare feet  
I don't care what they say about  
What they say about me  
Because I know that it's l-o-v-e  
You make me happy, you make me happy  
And I never listen to anyone  
(Let them all say! )  
  
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!  
I know what the boys want, I'm not gonna play  
Hey Lolita, hey! Hey Lolita, hey!  
Whistle all you want, but I'm not gonna stay  
No more skipping rope  
Skipping heartbeats with the boys downtown  
Just you and me feeling the heat  
Even when the sun goes down

Let's get out of this town, baby we're on fire  
Everyone around here wants to be going down, down  
If you stick with me, I can take you higher, and higher  
It feels like all of our friends are lost  
Nobody's found, found, found  
  
I got so scared, I thought no one could save me  
You came along scooped me up like a baby  
  
Every now and then, the stars align  
Boy and girl meet by the great design  
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?  
  
Everybody told me love was blind  
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind  
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time  
  
Bugging into my car, got a bad desire  
You know that we'll never leave if we don't get out now, now, now  
You're a crazy con and you're a crazy liar  
But baby, nobody can compare to the way you get down, down, down  
  
I tried so hard to act nice like a lady  
You taught me that it was good to be crazy  
  
Every now and then, the stars align  
Boy and girl meet by the great design  
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones?  
  
Everybody told me love was blind  
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind  
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time  
  
Feels like, feels like, you know, it feels like  
Falling in love for the first time  
Feels like, you know, it feels like  
Falling in love  
  
Every now and then, the stars align  
Boy and girl meet by the great design  
Could it be that you and me are the lucky ones  
  
Everybody told me love was blind  
Then I saw your face and you blew my mind  
Finally, you and me are the lucky ones this time

Maybe we could go to Coney Island  
Maybe I could sing the national anthem  
I, a white sweater, for the last white day  
Of the summer  
  
By my purple wig  
For my mermaid video  
Walk back to where we live  
In a motel  
Never knew  
  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
  
Heavy metal hour on T.V.  
Diamond Dave and Ray late  
And you salute me, Miss America  
Because I am, I am  
  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
  
Maybe we could go to Coney Island  
Maybe I could sing you to sleep  
God bless the universe, god bless the ocean  
God bless you and god bless me  
God bless you and god bless me  
  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off  
You call me lavender, you call me sunshine  
You say take it off, take it off

You said I was the most exotic flower  
Holding me close in our final hour  
  
I don't know how you convince them and get them, boy  
I don't know what you do, but you're unbelievable  
I don't know how you get over, get over  
Someone as dangerous, tainted and flawed as you  
  
One for the money and two for the show  
I love you honey, I'm ready I'm ready to go  
How did you get that way? I don't know  
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,  
You look like a million dollar man,  
So why is my heart broke?  
  
You got that world but baby at what price  
Something so strange, and it's hard to define  
  
It isn't that hard boy, to like you or even love you  
I will follow you down down down,  
you're unbelievable  
if you're going crazy just grab me and take me  
I would follow you down down down, like anywhere anywhere  
  
[Repeat x2]  
One for the money, two for the show  
I love you honey, I'm ready, I'm ready to go  
How did you get that way? I don't know  
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,  
You look like a million dollar man,  
So why is my heart broke?  
  
I don't know,  
You're screwed up, you're brilliant,  
You look like a million dollar man,  
So why is my heart broke?

You say that you wanna go  
To a land that's far away  
How are we supposed to get there  
With the way that we're living today?  
  
You talk lots about God  
Freedom comes from the call  
But that's not what this bitch wants  
No what I want at all  
  
I want money, power and glory  
I want money and all your power, all your glory  
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got  
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got  
  
The sun also rises on those who fail to call  
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls  
I can do it if you really, really like that  
I know what you really want, b-baby  
I can do it if you think you like that  
You should run, boy, run  
  
I want money, power and glory  
I want money and all your power, all your glory  
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got  
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got  
  
The sun also rises on those who fail to call  
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls  
I can do it if you really, really like that  
I know what you really want, b-baby  
I can do it if you think you like that  
You should run, boy, run  
  
I want money, power and glory  
I want money and all your power, all your glory  
Alleluia, I wanna take you for all that you got  
Alleluia, I'm gonna take them for all that they got  
  
The sun also rises on those who fail to call  
My life, it comprises of losses and wins and fails and falls  
I can do it if you really, really like that  
I know what you really want, b-baby  
I can do it if you think you like that  
You should run, boy, run

Money is the anthem, of success, so before we go out,  
What's your address?  
  
I'm your National Anthem, God, you're so handsome  
Take me to the Hamptons Bugatti Veyron  
He loves to romance 'em, reckless abandon, hold me for ransom, upper echelon  
He says to "be cool" but, I don't know how yet, wind in my hair,  
Hand on the back of my neck  
I said, "Can we party later on?" he said, "Yes."  
  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Ooh yeah baby bow down, makin' me so wild
now)  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Sugar sugar, how now, take your body
downtown)  
Red, white, blue's in the skies, summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in
your eyes  
I'm your National Anthem  
  
Money is the reason we exist  
Everybody knows it, it's a fact-kiss, kiss!  
  
I sing the National Anthem,  
While I'm standing over your body hold you like a python  
And you can't keep your hands off me, or your pants on  
See what you've done to me give me Chevron  
You said to "be cool" but, I'm already coolest  
I said to "get real, don't you know who you're dealing with?"  
Um, do you think you'll buy me lots of diamonds  
  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Ooh yeah baby bow down, makin' me so wild
now)  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Sugar sugar, how now, take your body
downtown)  
Red, white, blue's in the skies, summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in
your eyes  
I'm your National Anthem  
  
It's a love story for the new age,  
For the six page, we're on a quick, sick rampage  
Winin' and dinin', drinkin' and drivin', excessive buyin',  
Overdose and dyin' on our drugs and our love and our dreams and our rage  
Blurrin' the lines between real and the fake  
God can only, I need somebody to hold me  
He will do very well, I can tell, I can tell  
Keep me safe in his bell, tower, hotel  
  
Money is the anthem of success  
So put on mascara, and your party dress  
  
I'm your National Anthem, boy put your hands up, give me a standing ovation,  
Boy you have landed, babe in the land of, sweetness and danger, Queen of
Saigon  
  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Ooh yeah baby bow down, makin' me so wild
now)  
Tell me I'm your National Anthem (Sugar sugar, how now, take your body
downtown)  
Red, white, blue's in the skies, summer's in the air and baby, heaven's in
your eyes  
I'm your National Anthem  
  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success  
Money is the anthem, God, you're so handsome, money is the anthem,  
Of success

Another day is over,  
Another day is done  
And now I'm getting closer  
To the rising sun  
  
Chorus:  
Hey babe, what you doin'?  
Would you like a little company?  
Hey man, how you doin'?  
Would you like to sit next to me?  
  
Another day is over,  
Another day is done,  
Another night I'm waiting,  
Waiting for the sun  
  
Chorus:  
Hey babe, what you doin'?  
Would you like a little company?  
Hey man, how you doin'?  
Would you like to sit next to me?  
  
Well, I don't know, little lady,  
You're awfully pretty, but I'm a nice man,  
I live a nice life, I have a nice house,  
I have a great wife  
And I'm tired of making decisions  
Without thinking, oh oh oh  
  
Another moon is shining,  
Another evening come  
Another hour unwinding  
'Till the night is done  
  
Chorus:  
Hey man, what you doin'?  
Would you like a little company?  
Hey there, how you doin'?  
Would you like to sit next to me?  
Next to me  
Next to me

Want you like I never wanted anyone,  
You give it to me fast like free and fun.

Fly.  
  
Boy you're sweet like sugar cane,  
Make me feel alive again.  
  
I'm going down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.

You can buy my hot supersonic pop.  
Goin' down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.  
  
Want you like I've never wanted anyone,  
Got a face like God and a bod' like John.  
Kiss you like I never kissed anyone,  
Cause you keep it really rough like oh my God.  
  
Every time with you I can tell it's forever,  
I don't know how.  
And even if it's not, you know I couldn't stop,  
You make my heart go pow.  
  
Coming down like pouring,  
Make me feel alive again.  
  
I'm going down, down,  
Take you down to paradise.

You sitting in your office dreaming of a different life  
You say you wanna make me smile and see my wild side  
If we don't leave town now  
We're never gonna get out of here alive

Well, I didn't know it would come to this  
But that's what happens when you're on your own  
And you're alright letting nice things go  
  
Well, I pawned the earrings that you gave me  
Gold and made of flowers dangling  
And I almost cried as I sold them all  
I don't mind living on bread and oranges, no no  
But I gotta get to and from where I come  
And it's gonna take money to go  
Oh no, oh oh, oh oh...  
  
In the name of higher consciousness  
I let the best man I knew go  
'Cause it's nice to love and be loved  
But it's better to know all you can know  
I said it's nice to love and be loved  
But I'd rather know what God knows  
Oh no, oh no, oh no...  
  
I can do this once more  
No man can keep me together  
Been broken since I was born  
  
Well, I didn't know it would come to this  
But that's what happens when you're on your own  
And you're alright letting nice things go

You have a right  
To live your life  
Like no one else does  
Like no one else might  
  
If you have visions  
Come on and live them out  
  
All you need  
Is some peace while you are here  
Just let go  
Until you are home, dear  
  
I had a dream  
When I was young  
I dreamt our lives were  
Going to be fine  
  
We were always  
Waiting to live  
  
All you need  
Is some peace while you are here  
Just let go  
Of it all, dear  
  
You have a choice  
To hear the noise  
Or hear the sweet sound  
Of your sweet voice  
  
I know I've heard it  
I heard it in my sleep  
  
All you need  
Is some peace while you are here  
Just let go  
Don't say no, dear  
  
Wake up each night  
At the same time  
Pull up the blinds  
And look outside  
  
And in the orange light  
The fog is rising  
  
This is life  
This tonight  
Peace in the quiet  
Happiness  
Is the sky

Everybody knows that I'm a,  
Good girl, officer.  
No, I wouldn't do a thing like that,  
That's for sure.  
  
The house was already on fire,  
I swear, I'm not a liar.  
Well, I'm a little shaken,  
But I'm fine, thanks for asking.  
  
Tell me do you always,  
Work alone so late?  
Gosh, I don't lit if I,  
Stand in here in my nightgown.  
  
Do you really have to put,  
Those tight handcuffs on?  
  
Looking at me, then suddenly.  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in hurricane.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
I've been bad, I've been wrong,  
Playing a dangerous game.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
Hurricane, hurricane.  
  
Let's get in the back of your,  
Cop car, officer.  
You can ask me anything you want,  
Anything, anything.  
  
Do you have a girl? I don't see,  
A ring on your finger.  
Well that's interesting, have you,  
Ever thought of dating a singer?  
  
The flames are getting higher,  
So's my desire.  
It's kind of exciting,  
Don't you think?  
  
Then suddenly, he's uncuffing me.  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
I've been bad, I've been wrong,  
Playing a dangerous game.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
Hurricane, hurricane.  
  
If you can't stand the heat,  
Then stay out of the fire,  
You might get what you, desire.  
Boy, love is strange,  
Sometimes it makes you crazy,  
It can burn or break you.  
  
If you can't stand the heat,  
Then stay out of the fire,  
You might get what you, desire.  
Boy, love is strange,  
Sometimes it makes you crazy,  
It can burn or break you down.  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in hurricane.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
I've been bad, I've been wrong,  
Playing a dangerous game.  
I'm in love, I'm in love,  
Love in a hurricane.  
  
Hurricane, hurricane.

Pretty baby if you don't like the way  
That I touch you  
Then I won't touch you no more yeah  
Pretty baby if you don't like the way  
That I love you  
Then throw my love on the floor  
My mean daddy, my bad baby  
Don't you want me  
I don't believe you, when you say you  
Want to leave  
  
Darling, honey, if you don't think  
That you gonna want me  
Then honey let me know  
Listen honey, I don't wanna keep thinking  
You love me  
Just to find out you don't  
  
My mean daddy, my bad baby  
Don't you want me  
I don't believe you, when you say you  
Want to leave  
Won't you gonna miss me?  
Honey I'll miss you  
I just wanna kiss you, tonight  
  
Pretty baby if you don't like the way  
That I hold you  
Then honey let me go  
Pretty baby, if you don't like the way  
That I told you  
Then baby tell me so  
My mean daddy, my bad baby  
Don't you want me  
I don't believe you, when you say you  
Want to leave

You have this way of making me say the opposite of everything I mean  
I kiss you, I hug you, but I could not feel less connected from you!  
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried  
I know I could... not so happy time of your life.  
My dreams are bigger than all your junky pride  
I don't quit fit the part of... everything and falls into insanity.  
The sun beams, mean nothing if you can't find the light shining in one thing  
I know I want it all this, in the beginning I really tried  
I know I got you, and I'm not so happy... time of your life  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride.  
It's fine if you're hateful, as long as you remain grateful  
It made me nervous... like me I really tried  
The way I'm feeling in this moment it can't last my whole life!  
My dreams are bigger than your junky pride! aa

I seen you walk along the riverside  
I seen you walk along at ease  
And in the air I feel a silence  
It whispers perfect on the breeze  
And there's a voice that keeps me company  
It takes me closer to the stream  
And in the break of any suffering  
It makes me feel like there's no pain  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe  
I'm up a creek and you're my paddle  
Where there is you there is my soul  
Another dream where I'm the witness  
I am the witness to your goal  
Finally, finally, finally I'm getting closer  
To the dream.  
To my dream I believe.

Every single night when I go down to the west coast  
The people seem dead like I'm dancing with their ghost  
Nothing in this world keeps me more on my feet  
Than your sweet lovin' oooh your lovin'  
  
What happened to days when you were mine  
The way you looked, so God damned fine  
Guess I'll be alone this summertime  
  
'Cause I'm a sad girl dancing on my own  
Long way, far away from home  
Some day I will find you in the sunset  
I'm a sad girl, searching for a dream  
Just know that we're on each other's team  
Some day I will find you, you bet  
But now you've left me,  
Singing this sweet song  
Hold me, never held me for too long  
Love me, your love was porous like a rock  
Maybe you just forgot  
That I loved you

My baby lives in shades of blue  
Blue eyes and jazz and attitude  
He lives in California too  
He drives a chevy Malibu  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He lives for love, he loves his drugs  
He loves his baby too  
  
But I can't fix him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
My baby lives in shades of cool  
Blue heart and hands and aptitude  
He lives for love, for women, too  
I'm one of many, one is blue  
  
And when he calls  
He calls for me and not for you  
He prays for love, he prays for peace  
And maybe someone new  
  
But I can't help him, can't make him better  
And I can't do nothing about his strange weather  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable  
  
'Cause you are invincible  
I can't break through your world  
'Cause you live in shades of cool  
Your heart is unbreakable

You were the freak king of the piercing shop  
All the girls thought that they could sing  
But they're really not  
Shit I don't get it  
You're looking like a man, you're talking like a baby  
How the fuck is your song  
In a coke commercial crazy  
I don't get it  
Your taste once exquisite  
  
What happened to Brooklyn?  
What happened to New York?  
What happened to my scene?  
What happened to punk rock?  
  
You called me the queen  
Of the downtown scene babe  
How the fuck would you go  
Switch it up and then replace me?  
I don't get it  
I'm so legit  
  
Tell me was it cause I wasn't  
Platinum in jewels  
That perhaps you thought  
I was a little bit even uncool  
Kid was that it?  
Stefani you suck  
I know you're selling 20 million  
Wish they could've seen you  
When we booed you off in Williamsburg  
You're hurt  
I know my words don't hurt yeah  
Oh girl I see you walking round  
In your pearls  
Thinking that you're number  
You're so funny  
Coz honey you're not  
  
What happened to Brooklyn  
The last frontier  
They said you can make it anywhere  
If you can make it here  
But where no magic in the air  
  
What happened to Brooklyn?  
What happened to our scene baby?  
Have we all gone Gaga crazy?  
Remember when the streets used  
To be dangerous and we were born bad  
And we were born bad?  
  
Punk rock punk rock  
The boys used to punch each other in the face  
And girls were walking round wasted  
Everyone had a good night  
Came back when sunlight  
Punk rock, rock, rock

Oh, boy you're starry eyed  
Lay back, baby lay back  
You've got heaven in your eyes  
I like that, boy I like that  
  
Life doesn't always work out  
Like you planned it  
They say make lemonade out of lemons  
But I try and I just can't understand it  
All this trying for no good reason  
Man makes plans and God laughs  
Why do I even bother to ask?  
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town  
It doesn't matter now  
The sun set on our love, bye baby  
Oh, boy you're starry eyed  
Lay back, baby lay back  
You've got heaven in your eyes  
I like that, boy I like that  
Life doesn't always work out  
Like you planned it  
They say make lemonade out of lemons  
But I try and I can't understand it  
All this bragging for not good reason  
Man makes plans and God laughs  
Why do I even bother to ask?  
Well, once you and I, we were the king and queen of this town  
It doesn't matter now  
The sun set on our love, bye, bye baby  
Oh, boy you're starry eyed  
Lay back, baby lay back  
You've got heaven in your eyes  
I like that, boy I like that  
It doesn't matter what they say  
Let's go do it anyway  
'Cause you and I have an undying kind of love  
You can be mine, I'll be yours, be my baby  
Oh, boy you're starry eyed  
Lay back, baby lay back  
You've got heaven in your eyes  
I like that, boy I like that  
Oh, boy you're starry eyed  
Lay back, baby lay back  
You've got heaven in your eyes  
I like that, boy I like that

Like the summer of Sam, back in '69  
I'd be heavily battling on the grind  
Cause to sing this nice, it would be a crime  
Of the lettering, I'm murdering 'em  
  
Like the summer of love back in '69  
You can say that I'm rose, that my body is divine  
I belong to everybody that I walk by  
Like hi, hi  
  
I'm the master of my destiny  
You haven't seen the best of me  
And if you want the rest of me  
You'll have to pay a lovely fee  
Hault, to stay far, far away from me  
Cause I am the baddest girl in nyc  
You can look but please don't touch boy  
Stay away from me  
  
Baby I'm a cinnamon girl  
Keeping it fresh, on the e-est side  
Baby I'm a vitamin girl  
Keepin' in touch your cherry pie  
B-A-D-D-E-S-T, baddest girl in nyc  
Baby I'a a dangerous girl,  
You should stay away from me  
  
I've been murdering, I'm murdering on  
I be murdering, I'm murdering on  
  
Like the summer of Sam, back in '69  
I've been tyeing them up, and hang 'em out to dry  
Cause I'm hot like that when I walk to dry  
I be murdering, I'm murdering them  
  
Like the summer of love back in '69  
When I get on the microphone my, my  
Baby looking at you shudder like ay, ay, ay  
Like bye, bye  
Please excuse my mo-vivacity, capacity for hating  
Cause it's incredible  
It's better if you stay away from me,  
I know it's hard, hard to stay far, far away from me  
I am the baddest girl in nyc  
You can look but please don't touch boy  
But boy stew away from me

Kissable, invincible behavior is despicable

Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby you're the best

Dancing in the dark in the pale moonlight  
Got my hair up real big beauty queen style  
High heels off, I'm feeling alive

Telephone wires above all sizzlin' like your stare  
Honey I'm on fire I feel it everywhere  
Nothing scares me anymore

All that's real to me,  
Is Marilyn and Jesus.  
Jumping off'a bridges,  
Sparklers and streamers.  
  
Honey, I wanna fly,  
I wanna fly, I wanna fly.  
  
All that's real to me,  
Is Halloween and Jesus,  
Coney Island beaches,  
Chandeliers and seizures.  
  
Honey, I wanna fly,  
I wanna fly, I wanna fly.  
  
I can't be with the man I love,  
I can't be if he treats me rough.  
I can't see him, I can't call him up.  
  
All that's real to me,  
Is trailer parks and beaches,  
Alabama freezes,  
Platinum impeaches.  
  
Honey, I wanna fly,  
I wanna fly, I wanna fly.  
  
All that's real to me,

The other woman finds time  
To manicure her nails  
The other woman is perfect where her rival fails  
And she's never seen with pin curls in her hair anywhere  
  
The other woman enchants her clothes with French perfume  
The other woman keeps fresh cut flowers in each room  
There are never toys that's scattered everywhere  
  
And when her old man comes to call  
He finds her waiting like a lonesome queen  
Cause to be by her side  
It's such a change from old routine  
  
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep  
The other woman will never have his love to keep  
And as the years go by the other woman  
Will spend her life alone  
  
But the other woman will always cry herself to sleep  
The other woman will never have his love to keep  
And as the years go by the other woman  
Will spend her life alone

Remember how we used to party up all night  
Sneaking out and looking for a taste of real life  
Drinking in the small town firelight  
(Pabst Blue Ribbon on ice)  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Walking down the street as they whistle, "Hi, hi!"  
Stealin' police cars with the senior guys  
Teachers said we'd never make it out alive  
  
There she was my new best friend  
High heels in her hands, swayin' in the wind  
While she starts to cry, mascara runnin' down her little Bambi eyes:  
"Lana, how I hate those guys."  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse  
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first  
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him  
It's all gonna happen  
  
And that's where the beginning of the end begun  
Everybody knew that we had too much fun  
We were skippin' school and drinkin' on the job  
(With the boss)  
  
Sweet sixteen and we had arrived  
Baby's table dancin' at the local dive  
Cheerin our names in the pink spotlight  
Drinkin' cherry schnapps in the velvet night  
  
Know we used to go break in  
to the hotel pool, glittering we'd swim  
Runnin' from the cops in our black bikini tops  
screaming, "Get us while we're hot"  
"We don't give a whaaat!"  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse  
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't stick together 'cause we put our love first  
Don't cry about him, don't cry about him  
It's all gonna happen  
  
The prettiest crowd that you had ever seen  
Ribbons in our hair and our eyes gleamed mean  
A freshmen generation of degenerate beauty queens  
And you know something?  
  
They were the only friends I ever had  
We got into trouble and when stuff got bad  
I got sent away, I was waving on the train platform  
Crying 'cause I know I'm never comin' back.  
  
This is what makes us girls  
We don't look for heaven and we put our love first  
Don't you know we'd die for it? It's a curse  
Don't cry about it, don't cry about it  
This is what makes us girls  
Darlin' little queens do you know what you're worth?  
I'll tell you everyday till you get it, girl  
It's all gonna happen  
  
This is what makes us girls now, baby.  
This is why we rule the world now, baby.  
This is what makes us girls now, baby.  
Why we rule the world now, baby, oh.  
  
This is what makes us girls now, baby.  
This is why we rule the world now, baby.  
This is what makes us girls now, baby.  
Why we rule the world now, baby, oh.

Swinging in the backyard  
Pull up in your fast car whistling my name  
  
Open up a beer  
And you say get over here and play a video game  
  
I'm in his favorite sun dress  
Watching me get undressed take that body downtown  
  
I say you the bestest  
Lean in for a big kiss put his favorite perfume on  
  
Go play your video game  
  
It's you, it's you, it's all for you  
Everything I do

Heaven is a place on earth with you  
Tell me all the things you want to do  
I heard that you like the bad girls honey, is that true?  
It's better than I ever even knew  
They say that the world was built for two  
Only worth living if somebody is loving you  
Baby now you do  
  
Singing in the old bars  
Swinging with the old stars  
Living for the fame  
  
Kissing in the blue dark  
Playing pool and wild darts  
Video games  
  
He holds me in his big arms  
Drunk and I am seeing stars  
This is all I think of  
  
Watching all our friends fall  
In and out of Old Paul's  
This is my idea of fun  
Playing video games  
  
It's you, it's you, it's all for you  
Everything I do  
I tell you all the time  
Heaven is a place on earth with you  
Tell me all the things you want to do

Wait a little longer, kid  
What you grow up so fast for?  
Why you're doing like I did?  
Didn't you say I got what I asked for

Got a long way, rest your feet

And you're always close to me  
You're a different kid but it's the same damn thing

You didn't think about anyone else  
You didn't think about any of us  
When you left that place  
You didn't wanna go anywhere else  
Nothing could satisfy you to you left  
So you went away  
Where you go?  
Where are you now  
I ask about  
So many of my friends  
Oh about their ends  
What about us?  
I'll reach us to dust  
On the floor again  
I thought we were on an end  
  
You really put me in a quite a position  
You got me struggling as a musician  
With the song  
You like to write about all of your problems  
The... Songs because you think it was often  
But you're wrong  
Why did you go  
Why did you unknown  
Maybe my question is  
Why must I come to this  
You talk about being strong yeah  
How I wanna be you and your melody  
  
Tryin to learn about something important  
You keep taking onf space you're annoying  
But our love is so  
Yeah you already know  
You're tryin to teach me that new is a living  
You're tryin to teach me way to forgiving  
Make it hard  
You're such a bad bad boy  
I love you anyway  
No matter what what they say  
You were not approved  
But you are on the moon  
I care about at this terms out  
It's just more than I  
Heaven know how to fight  
I guess I'm...  
Tell me I have to, tell me I have to

Put me onto your black motorcycle  
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"  
It only takes two hours to Nevada  
I wear your sparkle  
You call me your mama  
  
Let me put on a show for you daddy  
Let me put on a show  
Let me put on a show for you tiger  
Let me put on a show  
  
Hello Heaven  
You are a tunnel lined with yellow lights  
On a dark night (Dark night)  
  
Yayo, yes you, yayo  
  
Put me onto your black motorcycle  
Fifties baby doll dress for my 'I do"  
It only takes two hours to Nevada  
I wear your sparkle  
You call me your mama  
  
Let me put on a show for you daddy  
Let me put on a show  
Let me put on a show for you tiger  
Let me put on a show

You taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my  
I love you but I don't know why...  
  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce  
I like you a lot, I like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog  
You know that I like, like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...  
  
He had a cigarette with his number on it  
He gave it over to me, "do you want it?"  
I knew it was wrong but I palmed it  
I saved it, I waited, I called it  
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips  
The liquor on your lips makes you dangerous  
I knew it was wrong, I'm beyond it  
I tried to be strong but I lost it.  
  
You taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my...  
  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce  
I like you a lot, I like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog  
You know that I like, like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...  
  
He has a white corvette like I want it  
A fire in his eyes, no, I saw it  
He's bleeding from his brain and his wallet  
He's sick and he's taken but honest  
The liquor on your lips, the liquor on your lips  
The liquor on his lips I just can't resist  
As close as I'll get to the darkness  
He tells me to "shut up, I got this."  
  
You taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my...  
  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce  
I like you a lot, I like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog  
You know that I like, like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...  
  
I need you, I need you babe  
Like I never needed anyone  
You're wrong but you're so much fun  
You say you trat me mean to keep  
The opinion of that night  
But you taste like the fourth of July  
Malt liquor on your breath, my, my...  
  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Taste like a keg party, back on the sauce  
I like you a lot, I like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...  
You can be the boss, daddy  
You can be the boss  
Bad to the bone, sick as a dog  
You know that I like, like you a lot  
Don't let it stop...

Jerry says that in the dark,  
I think I have a good idea.  
That I should do the opposite,  
  
Of whatever it is I feel  
That's because I have a bad mind  
And I have gold in my veins  
But he said I got the purest heart  
That he's ever seen  
  
What God gave me a brain for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for  
If He won't help me do it?  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
  
I can tell that you're the type  
To never trust a beauty queen  
But I was never voted for nothing and,  
Highschool never meant anything to anybody  
Never ever gave myself away  
But even when I'm funny  
You think I'm acting so I say  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a plan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
  
You say that you don't want to be hypnotized  
But baby, I, I don't wanna hypnotize you  
There's nothing from you that I wanna take  
I just wanna be like you  
Maybe love you just a little bit  
Please  
  
Tell 'em mom and daddy gave themselves,  
I won't to you  
You told me to get my ways as I do what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna strike out, right now  
I'm striking out right now with this song  
But I can't help myself  
I can't do right for long  
  
What God give me a break for  
If he won't let me use it?  
What God give me a Wlan for?  
He never helps me do it  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you  
You're gonna love me  
I'm gonna make you
