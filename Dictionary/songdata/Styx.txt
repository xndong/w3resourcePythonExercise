I stand accused before you  
I have no tears to cry,  
And you will never break me,  
'Till the day I die  
  
A criminal mind, is all I  
All I've ever had,  
Ask one who's known me,  
If I'm really so bad  
I am  
  
I've spent my life behind these steel bars,  
I've paid my dept in time,  
But being brought to justice,  
That was my only crime  
  
A criminal mind, is all I,  
All I've ever had,  
Ask one who's known me,  
If I'm really so bad  
I am  
  
Before you hand me over,  
Before you read my sentence,  
I'd like to say a few words,  
Here in my own defense  
  
Some people struggle daily,  
They struggle with their conscience 'till the end  
I have no guilt to harm me,  
I feel no wrong intent  
  
A criminal mind, is all I,  
All I've ever known,  
Don't try to reform me,  
'Cause I'm made of cold stone  
  
My criminal mind, is all I,  
All I ever had,  
Ask one who's known me,  
If I'm really so bad,  
I am (yeah!)  
  
Whoa oh I am  
Whoa oh I am  
Made of cold stone  
I'm made of cold stone  
Just like the prison walls  
I'm made of cold stone  
Got a criminal mind  
Whoa oh oh  
Whoa oh oh yeah  
A criminal mind  
I got a criminal mind  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  
  
A criminal,  
Mind

Woke up in rainy autumn  
Morning mist beginning to wane  
And the birds of the winged trees  
Calling my name  
  
Care less the clouds above me  
The wind is gently lifting my hair  
Where the rivers of the wind fall light rain  
Now stand bare  
  
Listen to the flowing streams  
Golden in the shelter of my dreams  
Playing a song on the meadow that echoes with love  
  
Walk alone through the garden  
The leaves are wet with morning's tear  
And the whispering of someone  
Is drawing me near  
  
Content to rest awhile  
Pondering the motion of time  
Over unforgotten memories  
Dipped in wine  
  
Listen to the flowing streams  
Golden in the shelter of my dreams  
Playing a song on the meadow that echoes with love  
  
The god of dusk is falling around me  
The night air now restless and dank  
Yet the fields are specked with flowers  
Few and rank  
  
Moon reflecting off the water  
Rippling an image to me  
Of the way that it is  
And the way that it's going to be  
  
Listen to the flowing streams  
Golden in the shelter of my dreams  
Playing a song on the meadow that echoes with love

I'm just a man  
please let me  
sing my song  
  
it's been ten years  
since I met you  
and I first held your hand  
  
my Suzanne  
  
that summer night  
we dreamed of  
days to come  
  
I held you there  
beside me  
we carved the wishing tree  
  
and then  
we played the part of lovers  
on that summer night  
  
we played the part of lovers  
you gave all your love and you made it seem right  
you made me a man oh so young in my life  
  
one simple verse  
like the words in a play  
you spoke your lines  
and I knew I must stay  
oh I must stay  
  
now we are free  
and we are growing old  
the wishing tree still stands there  
and shades our memories  
  
of when  
we played the part of lovers  
on that summer night  
  
we played the part of lovers  
you gave all your love and you made it seem right  
you made me a man oh so young in my life

you come to me girl  
tears are in your eyes  
your head's bowed in sorrow  
you whisper your good-byes  
  
there's nothing I can tell you  
to make you want to stay  
so let me ask one question  
before you slip away  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go?  
after you leave me  
what will I do?  
  
I've seen this moment coming  
for such a long, long time  
I've laid awake for hours  
rehearsing every line  
  
but now that it's here girl  
can't think of anything to say  
so let me ask one question  
before you slip away  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go?  
after you leave me  
what will I do?  
  
every time that  
I get next to her  
I'm hung up in this ring of fire  
  
if I love her  
should I let her go  
or should I beg on a bended knee?  
  
how much longer  
lord, I just don't know  
I just can't take it girl  
I'm breaking up o'er you  
  
after you leave me  
where can I go?  
after you leave me  
what will I do?  
  
after you  
after you leave

She wakes up from a dream, checks the mirror for reality  
She says "Come on girl, it's all in a day's work"  
Gets herself dressed just in time, disappears on the 8:05  
Oh the whistle blows and it's all in a day's work  
'Til she calls it a day  
  
Oh she smiles as he glances up from the swimsuit issue  
Oh she sighs as he walks away into the downtown day  
  
Day after day night after night  
Loneliness creeps in her window  
She locks the door, turns off the light  
Rehearsing a kiss on her pillow, she cries  
It's all in a day's work  
  
Turning pages while the memories pass  
Familiar faces from her senior class  
How the years go by when it's all in a day's work  
"Dearest Ruby, hope you reach your star  
Don't ever change, stay as sweet as you are"  
And when a teardrop falls she calls it a day's work  
She calls it a day  
  
Oh she waits by the telephone for the call he promised  
Oh it's late  
She puts her heart away for another day  
  
Day after day night after night  
Loneliness creeps in her window  
She locks the door, turns off the light  
Rehearsing a kiss on her pillow, she cries  
All in a day's work

Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this?  
Did you ever in good time think  
my life had gone amiss?  
Now I feel I've been unfair  
'cause I catch you hanging there.  
Did you ever in your life before  
feel as bad as this?  
  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didn't do no good.  
My damnedest try to make it work,  
I knew it never would.  
Now there's nothin' wrong with you,  
and there's nothing you could ever do.  
God knows I tried a half a year  
but it didn't do no good.  
  
The times were good,  
but over now,  
a pleasant memory.  
I'm sorry, there's another face  
one that's close to me.  
You know 'bout what I learned  
and there's no stone left unturned.  
The times were good,  
but over now,  
a pleasant memory. (Sigh)

Babe I'm leaving  
I must be on my way  
The time is drawing near  
My train is going  
I see it in your eyes  
The love, the need, your tears  
But I'll be lonely without you  
And I'll need your love to see me through  
So please believe me  
My heart is in your hands  
And I'll be missing you  
  
'Cause you know it's you babe  
Whenever I get weary  
And I've had enough  
Feel like giving up  
You know it's you babe  
Giving me the courage  
And the strength I need  
Please believe that it's true  
Babe, I love you  
  
You know it's you babe  
Whenever I get weary  
And I've had enough  
Feel like giving up  
You know it's you babe  
Giving me the courage  
And the strength I need  
Please believe that it's true  
Babe, I love you  
  
Babe, I'm leaving  
I'll say it once again  
And somehow try to smile  
I know the feeling we're trying to forget  
If only for a while  
'Cause I'll be lonely without you  
And I'll need your love to see me through  
Please believe me  
My heart is in your hands  
'Cause I'll be missing you  
Babe, I love you  
Babe, I love you  
Ooh, babe

Take me back to my boat on the river  
I need to go down, I need to calm down  
Take me back to my boat on the river  
And I won't cry out any more  
Time stands still as I gaze in her waters  
She eases me down, touching me gently  
With the waters that flow past my boat on the river  
So I don't cry out anymore  
  
Oh the river is wide  
The river it touches my life like the waves on the sand  
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base  
Where the frown on my face disappears  
Take me down to my boat on the river  
And I won't cry out anymore  
  
Oh the river is deep  
The river it touches my life like the waves on the sand  
And all roads lead to Tranquility Base  
Where the frown on my face disappears  
Take me down to my boat on the river  
I need to go down  
Won't you let me go down  
Take me back to my boat on the river  
And I won't cry out anymore  
And I won't cry out anymore  
And I won't cry out anymore

I am the thief of the highway  
Rich man you better take hold  
'Cause last night while you lie sleeping  
I came to steal all your gold  
  
All the King's horses  
All the King's men  
Surrounded the chapel  
To trap me within  
  
A Lady in waiting  
Lips red with rouge  
She offered me pleasures  
I could not refuse  
No, no, no  
  
For I was born  
Born for adventure  
Women whisky and sin  
No I'll never surrender  
Live by the sword till the end  
  
All the King's horses  
All the King's men  
Were drinking and dancing  
At Fezewig's Inn  
  
They spoke of my capture  
And of my escape  
They called it misfortune  
But I called it fate  
No, no, no  
  
For I was born  
Born for adventure  
Women whisky and sin  
No I'll never surrender  
Live by the sword till the end

Yeah yeah!  
Don't look now, but here come the eightees!  
  
I was so cool back in sixty-five  
I had it made 'cause I understood what to do to survive  
I had my car, and I made the scene  
Didn't give a damn about no gasoline  
They can go to hell  
My friend we never thought about the world  
And its realities  
The promised land was ours  
We were the Great Society  
  
I'm so confused by the things I read, I need the truth  
But the truth is, I don't know who to believe  
The left say yes, and the right says no  
I'm in between and the more I learn  
Well, the less that I know  
I got to make a show  
  
Livin' high, living fine  
Livin' high on borrowed time  
  
Yes! No!  
Yes! No!  
No! Yes!  
No! Yes!  
  
Faith be with me now  
I'm just a dreamer in a dreamland  
Faith be with me now  
I'm just a dreamer in a dreamland  
  
'Cause we're  
Livin' high  
Livin' fine (You know I'm livin' fine)  
Livin' high (Yes I'm livin' high)  
On borrowed time (On borrowed time)  
Livin' high (Whoohoo!)  
Livin' fine (Ahhh!)  
Livin' high  
On Lake Shore Drive (Midnight ride)  
Livin' high (We're livin' high)  
On Leslie Lane (Let's go back and play it again!)  
Livin' high (We're livin' high)  
On Red Bud Trail (On Red Bud, Red Bud Trail!)  
Livin' high  
On Central Drive (He's on Central Drive!)  
Livin' high (We're livin', livin' high)  
On Prestwick Drive (Catch me on Prestwick Drive  
Livin' high (...gettin' in and drivin' my Mercedes  
Livin' fine (...up and down and up and down - shit! I don't)

The lines are drawn in the sand across the caress of time  
The lines are drawn in the sand across the caress of time  
  
There's a face in the glass  
Looking through the mirror  
At the maze of my past  
It was never clearer  
  
On the distant horizon  
The sun approaches  
Better cover my eyes  
Better hide the roaches  
  
In the best of my time  
There was something better  
And the quest of my mind  
Was to try and get her  
  
Something simple and pure  
As the thoughts in my head  
Not the tears in the rain  
Over me she shed  
  
We were almost there  
Still I was unaware  
  
Here in the Brave New World's embrace  
I watch the parade begin  
Searching for one familiar face  
And I wonder where I fit in  
How will I know if there's a place  
For me in the Brave New World  
  
To be calm in the eye  
Of the human storm  
In house full of dreams  
I am safe and warm  
  
Looking back at a life  
Filled with warm embraces  
No regrets only memories  
Of smiling faces  
  
We were almost there  
Now change is in the air  
  
Until now I held the zone  
I ruled the world  
I called it home  
I never saw the down side  
  
See the now see the Zen  
There is no division  
Through the eyes of a child  
There is perfect vision  
  
And the best of our lives  
Resonate the hills  
And the sun's gonna shine  
And you know that I will

Captain America is that you  
Flying down the highway  
In your red white and blue  
  
You remind me of the days  
In that infamous war  
When we weren't quite sure  
What we were fighting for  
  
I see you again and it makes me think  
About just who I am  
Is there someone in charge  
Who can lead the way tonight  
Who knows the plan  
  
Where there's love  
There is grace  
There's still hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
Gives me faith in the human race  
  
Captain America what do you see  
Millions of your brothers say they'll fight to be free  
Who could have known you would be the chosen one  
To kick start our dreams  
The cycle of life goes around and round again  
Tell me what does it mean  
Can it be true  
  
Where there's love  
There is grace  
And there's hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
Gives me faith in the human  
  
If we could trade all of our tomorrows  
For the best of our yesterdays  
Erase all the pain and the sorrow  
Would there have to be a high price to pay  
Hey Hey  
  
We run for our lives  
And we're searching for shelter now  
From the coming storm  
Are you the man who can lead us once again  
So come on, suit up, let's go  
  
Where there's love  
There is grace  
And there's hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
There's not a damn thing we can't face  
  
Where there's love  
There is grace  
And there's hope left in this place  
And the smile on your face  
Gives me faith in the human  
Faith in the human race  
Yeah, I got faith

Time stands still, baby when I touch you  
I can't believe the way I'm feelin'  
Please don't speak, it's taken me all this time  
To find the strength just to say  
  
That I never knew what love was til I met you  
Never thought that I could act this way  
But I'm still afraid to show how much I need you  
Tell me, what makes a man like me this way  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Lovers' hearts never quite beat in time  
They never find that perfect rhythm  
You know I let you down many times  
But this I promise to you  
That I'll never lead you through doors of deception  
I won't bind you to a chain of lies  
Though I know my love for you won't be perfection  
What I give to you will last all time  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, my words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart  
  
Take a little time to realize  
I'll love you faithfully  
Just take a little time and you'll see  
That baby it's me  
  
Carrie Ann, don't ask me why  
Baby I work so hard just to hide my emotions  
Carrie Ann, my words can't explain  
The way that I feel in my heart

Once in a dream  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Down by the bay where the  
Moonlit water falls  
I stood alone while the minstrel sang his song  
So afraid I'd lost my soul  
  
There in the fog his song kept calling me  
Leading me on with its haunting melody  
Deep in my heart a voice kept echoing  
I knew I'd soon be wandering  
  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Where the distant harbour meets the sky  
There the battle raged like hell  
And every dove had lost its will to fly  
  
Far beyond these castle walls  
Where I thought I heard Tiresias say  
Life is never what it seems  
And every man must meet his destiny

I'm tired of your psychology  
To bring me to my bended knees  
And if I could only talk to you  
I'm sure that I could make you see  
'Cause time has a way  
Of bringing even mountains down, down, down  
Storm clouds are coming  
I suggest you head for higher ground  
  
I say you're a thing of the past  
And you ain't gonna last  
No matter what you say or do  
It's all caught up to you  
  
You're duty-free, you're tax-exempt  
You party with the President  
And you dance the dance so naturally  
Why not believe you're heaven-sent  
But time has a way of bringing  
Even mountains down, down, down  
There's a storm cloud a-comin'  
I insist you head for higher ground  
  
You talk talk and you get so intense  
That you almost make sense  
And that's what scares me the most  
You as the host of Celebrity Lies  
It's prime time, baby  
Can't you see in my eyes, it's a  
  
Cold war-runnin' in the streets  
Everybody you meet knows  
It's going down, don't you know  
Cold war-blowing in the air  
Everyone everywhere says it's time  
To get ready for a cold war  
Don't you look now  
But the skinny boy's becoming a man  
  
You say it's the luck of the draw  
And you can't have it all  
And I'll die young trying to make it  
Into something that ain't gonna last  
You ought to reconsider  
'Cause I'm coming fast with a  
  
Cold war-running in the streets  
Everybody you meet  
Know's it's going down, don't you know  
Cold war-blood is in the air  
Everyone everywhere says it's time  
To get ready for a cold war-looking at me  
From behind every tree  
There's a scared man running from a  
Cold war-don't you look now  
But the skinny boy's a streetfighting man  
  
[extra verses sung in concert during the Kilroy tour:]  
Try as you will, you can't escape the chill  
that penetrates your clothing,  
demanding that you feel  
all the trouble that surrounds you,  
the bad mixed with the good,  
the heartless bits of data waiting to be understood  
Information Central promptly processed your request,  
the task we're told honestly requires you acquiesce.  
  
Well, blind faith put you where you are now  
You're a selfish old cow gettin' high on society's milk.  
We pay your bills, life should be so tough.  
You'd better watch your fat ass, 'cause we've had enough!

I'm sailing away set an open course for the virgin sea  
I've got to be free, free to face the life that's ahead of me  
On board I'm the captain so climb aboard  
We'll search for tomorrow on every shore  
And I'll try oh Lord I'll try to carry on  
  
I look to the sea reflections in the waves spark my memory  
Some happy some sad  
I think of childhood friends and the dreams we had  
We live happily forever so the story goes  
But somehow we missed out on that pot of gold  
But we'll try best that we can to carry on  
  
A gathering of angels appeared above my head  
They sang to me this song of hope and this is what they said  
They said come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
Come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
  
I thought that they were angels but to my surprise  
They climbed aboard their starship and headed for the skies  
Singing come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me  
Come sail away come sail away  
Come sail away with me

I used to like to walk the straight and narrow line  
I used to think that everything was fine  
Sometimes I'd like to sit and gaze for days through sleepless dreams  
All alone and trapped in time  
All alone and trapped in time  
  
I wonder what tomorrow has in mind for me  
Or am I even in it's mind at all  
Perhaps I'll get a chance to look ahead and see  
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball  
Soon as I find myself a crystal ball  
  
Tell me, tell me where I'm going  
I don't know where I've been  
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me  
And then tell me again  
My heart is breaking, my body's aching  
And I don't know where to go  
Tell me, tell me, won't you tell me  
I've just got to know  
  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I need to know  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I've got to know  
Crystal ball  
  
If you should see me walking  
Through your dreams at night  
Would you please direct me  
Where I ought to be  
I've been looking for a crystal ball  
To shed the light  
To find a future in me  
To find a future in me  
  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I need to know  
Crystal ball  
There's so many things I've got to know  
Crystal ball

What can I do  
Pictures of you still make me cry  
Trying to live without your love  
It's so hard to do  
Some nights I'll wake up  
I'll look at your pillow  
Hoping that I'll see you there  
But I get up each day, not much to say  
I've nowhere to go  
Loneliness fills me up inside  
'Cause I'm missing you  
So if you'll give us a chance to remember  
The love we had once together  
Wait and see  
Time is all that we really need  
I'm praying you won't say no  
I mean to tell you  
  
Don't let it end  
Baby we could have so much more  
Don't let it end  
Honey please don't walk out that door  
  
I'm telling you baby, I made my mistakes  
But I'll make you this promise to do what it takes  
I'll be there to protect you and hold you tight  
You got my lovin' baby every single night  
  
Don't let it end  
I'm begging you, don't let it end this way  
Don't let it end  
I'm begging you, don't let it end this way  
  
Don't let it end  
Baby we could have so much more  
Don't let it end  
Honey please don't walk out that door  
Don't let it end  
I'm begging you don't let it end this way  
Don't let it end  
I'm begging you don't let it end this way, no, no, no  
No, no, no  
  
What will I do  
If you say we're through  
I need you to stay, honey  
Don't let it end this way.

I woke up today, the papers spoke of a man we know  
He's made of the stuff they say that first made our country grow  
Living in style, traveling to distant lands  
Better hang tough, for now it's time to make your stand  
Can we ignore the basic facts of history  
Or deny what people say is destiny  
I think the message is ever so loud and clear  
  
Eddie, now don't you run  
You know you're a bootlegger's son  
And you saw just what it's done to the others  
Eddie, now don't you run  
It's the end of all your fun  
And you saw just what they've done  
To your brothers  
  
Can we ignore the basic facts of history  
Or deny what people say is destiny  
First in the eighties but last of the sons  
First in the eyes of his countrymen  
I think the message is ever so loud and clear  
  
Eddie, now don't you run  
You know you're a bootlegger's son  
And you saw just what it's done to the others  
Eddie, now don't you run  
It's the end of all your fun  
And you saw just what they've done  
To your brothers

It's coming on like a fever  
Burning deep inside of your brain  
Have you become a believer  
Have you gone a little insane  
  
Tonight your life is a party  
Let the celebration begin  
Turn on the lights and let's start it  
Find out what condition your condition is in  
  
Check in  
Check out  
No one needs to know  
What you're thinking about  
In the here  
In the now  
You can take it in  
While you're working it out  
'Cause you're into it  
When you're out of it  
Everything is cool in the land  
Of the brave new world  
  
Hail to the new corporation  
Fulfilling every need and desire  
Come take a mental vacation  
The reservation never expires  
  
I say we make it a holiday  
Bigger than the 4th of July  
Declare a new independence Day  
Yeah there's nothing to it  
You can do it if you try  
  
Time is always on our side  
Love is there to be our guide  
We are spirits pure and free  
And all our dreams are meant to be  
Realized  
  
But if we were granted just one minute  
To choose a dream and stay there in it  
How could we decide?  
  
We are a sea of tranquility  
We are the new golden age  
History is a mystery  
We will start it over on  
A blank new page  
  
Check in  
Check out  
No one needs to know  
What you're thinking about  
In the here  
In the now  
You can take it in  
While you're working it out  
'Cause you're into it  
When you're out of it  
Everything is cool in the land  
Of the brave new world  
  
And life is good

evil eyes  
stole my heart on a dark December night  
souls of flame  
loving her has made me half insane  
  
the way she cast me  
in her spell  
secrets I couldn't tell  
were for me  
and for you  
  
once I knew  
the joys of loving were for me and you  
but now she's here  
and with her secrets I know I'll have to bear  
  
to let her take me  
from your side  
rob me of all my pride  
and my love  
oh sweet love  
  
evil eyes  
she's got those  
evil eyes  
though I'm only her friend  
I know I'll love her till the end  
of my life  
oh sweet life  
  
evil eyes  
she's got those  
evil eyes  
though I'm only her friend  
I know I'll love her till the end  
of my life

Hell nobody's perfect  
One hundred percent  
No saint, no Pope, no King no Queen  
No President  
  
But our hunger for heroes  
Has made us blind  
We seek salvation  
From the cup of human kind  
  
But every time we hear the voice  
Of some new Abraham  
We wake too late to realize  
It was just another scam  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall  
  
I said nobody's perfect  
From head to toe  
Not Einstein or Elvis or Lenin or Marx  
Or Marilyn Monroe  
  
Cause it's mostly illusion  
In flesh and bone  
An image, a look, a song or a book  
That we all claim for our own  
  
But even in the best of us  
There lies beneath the skin  
The tragic flaw in nature's law  
That's bound to do us in  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall  
  
Pretty faces up on the silver screen  
Flawless bodies on covers of magazines  
They all look perfect to us  
So rich and cool and bored  
But hold the presses boys  
They've checked into Betty Ford  
  
Turns out nobody's perfect  
From "A" to "Z"  
It's best to follow your heart  
Then to follow me  
Cause I'm only a singer  
Playin' a song  
And I've just been making it up  
As I went along  
  
See I met a man who told me once  
"Sincerity's the key  
And once you learn to fake it  
Son you're gonna be home free"  
  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
Well I guess you were no angel after all  
Fallen angel, fallen angel  
You always take us with you when you fall

father  
you're a sad old man  
your tawdry vest is gray  
  
memories  
of a former man  
are all your words convey  
  
father  
oh can't you see  
the tarnished robe you wear  
  
a crown  
for fools  
the people laugh  
you never seem to hear

you're life's a ship  
that's never been to sea  
  
the bottle  
that surrounds your life  
you'll sail eternally

please understand  
a man must stand alone  
  
and face a world  
he'll never know  
and never call his own

Sometimes I close my eyes  
And picture the plains  
I see Buffalo Bill and the Iroquois  
Riding again  
  
Open skies, fertile ground  
This was heaven on earth  
That they found  
  
We got what they gave  
By their God we were saved  
They were humble not depraved  
These streets we're afraid of  
Once were the fields of the brave  
The fields of the brave  
  
Where a Chevrolet rusts  
By a closed shopping mall  
Can you see through the dust  
Where the brave ones stood tall  
  
Buried deep where they fell  
They live on in the stories we tell  
  
They got what they gave  
By their God they were saved  
And I say this as I pray  
I can't help but dream of  
The days these were fields of the brave  
The fields of the brave  
  
After all this time  
And the struggles in between  
We stand next in line  
With the chance we can build on their dreams  
In the  
  
Fields of the brave  
Fields of the brave  
We got what they gave  
  
In the fields of the brave  
Let their spirits be saved  
And I pray this on their graves  
There'll be a return of  
The days these were fields of the brave  
The fields of the brave

The lights are low  
And we're alone  
The fire's glow  
It keeps us warm  
As I reach out and touch your face  
The moon lights up our first embrace  
But please don't hesitate  
Hold my hand, don't be afraid  
Of the feelings in your heart  
Just close your eyes, no one will mind  
If we're to fall in love this first time  
  
Don't be afraid of love  
Don't be afraid of love  
Don't be afraid of love  
  
It's the first time  
The first time for love  
There could be so many worlds and mountains  
We could climb  
Together, the two of us tonight  
  
The two of us, we're quite a pair  
These lonely nights we both can share  
So don't be shy, 'cause it's okay  
I understand feeling that way  
Hold my hand, don't be afraid  
Of the feelings in your heart  
Close your eyes, no one will mind  
If we're to fall in love this first time  
It's the first time  
The first time for love  
There could be so many worlds and mountains  
We could climb  
Together, the two of us tonight

You see the world through your cynical eyes  
You're a troubled young man I can tell  
You've got it all in the palm of your hand  
But your hand's wet with sweat and your head needs a rest  
  
And you're fooling yourself if you don't believe it  
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it  
Why must you be such an angry young man  
When your future looks quite bright to me  
How can there be such a sinister plan  
That could hide such a lamb, such a caring young man  
  
You're fooling yourself if you don't believe it  
You're kidding yourself if you don't believe it  
Get up, get back on your feet  
You're the one they can't beat and you know it  
Come on, let's see what you've got  
Just take your best shot and don't blow it  
  
You're fooling yourself if you don't believe it  
You're killing yourself if you don't believe it  
Get up, get back on your feet

Just take your best shot and don't blow it

When I was a young man, I had to kick and scratch and claw  
Now it's like top gun in the Old West, everybody wants me to draw  
If I had known it would be like this I might have given it a second thought  
But if someone had told me to give it up, it's a line that I wouldn't have
bought  
  
Look at me  
I'm the great white hope  
Can't you see  
I'm up against the ropes  
Don't you know  
It's so hard to cope  
When you feel  
Like the great white hope  
  
Now you've paid your money you're sitting in your ringside seat  
And I know that some of you out there, might want to see the champ get beat  
If I had known it would be like this I might have given it a second thought  
But real life sure isn't like school, there's some lessons that just can't be
taught  
  
Look at me  
I'm the great white hope  
Can't you see  
I'm up against the ropes  
Don't you know  
It's so hard to cope  
When you feel  
Like the great white hope

Half penny, two penny, gold Krugerrand  
He was exceedingly rich for such a young man  
Sad story, old story  
Bring out the band  
Another divorce just a few hundred grand  
  
Half penny, two penny, back of the queue  
Yes mister poor man this means you  
Justice for money what can you say  
We all know it's the American Way  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
  
Half penny, two penny, back in the States  
You just couldn't take that African pace  
Yes, Mrs. Cleaver your son's home to stay  
We all know it's the American Way  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
  
"Come here - hey Angelo... what's happenin'?"  
"Hey, Stosh, good to see ya"  
"What the hell you doin'?"  
"We're tearing this old building down here"  
"Oh you're kiddin' me. Remember when we were kids, and we used to come here
every Saturday afternoon to see a cartoon?"  
"Yeah, I remember"  
"Well what's she lost to?"  
"Who knows- politicians, taxes...it's a disgrace"  
"I'm not surprised, they make me sick. They don't make theaters like this any
more."  
  
Half penny, two penny, ashes to dust  
The almighty dollar says "In God we trust"  
Justice for money how much more can I pay  
We all know it's the American Way  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
(I want to be free)  
  
Yes, I'm gonna shake myself loose  
Back home across the sea  
Where I know that I will be free  
(We all want to be free)

Sittin' here on terra firma  
It's the kind of place we were meant to be  
Out here kinda lost in space now  
Pondering life's mysteries  
All of minkind worship at the altar  
Of old mythology  
But the genie's out of the bottle  
Collision course with eternity  
  
Young children playing in the chat room  
With the freaks and the satellites  
Upload the nearset planet  
Burnin' out at the speed of light  
Better living for the masses  
With the new technology  
But some fool went and pushed the button  
He didn't get an apology  
  
Feeling good is a new sensation  
Panacea for the Prozac nation  
  
Heavy, heavy water  
Won't wash away the sins of the father  
  
Sacred cow sizzling in the fire  
As we all go up in flames  
With millions of true believers  
And their unfamiliar names  
On the road to good intentions  
Blown to hell by our own inventions  
Heavy, heavy water  
Won't wash away the sins of the father  
Unholy, holy water  
Leading us like lambs to the  
  
Custom made for the self reliant  
Lemonade for the thirsty giant  
  
Heavy, heavy water  
Won't wash away the sins of the father  
Unholy, holy water  
Leading us like lambs to the (slaughter)

I don't want to hear about it anymore  
It's a shame I've got to live without you anymore  
There's a fire in my heart,a pounding in my brain's driving me crazy  
  
We don't need to talk about it anymore  
Yesterday's just a memory can we close the door  
I just made one mistake,I didn't know what to say when you called me,baby  
  
Don't say goodnight,say your gonna stay forever  
All, all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
To fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
It's never over yesterday's just a memory  
Yesterdays just a memory  
  
And I don't want to live without you anymore  
Can't you see I'm in misery and you know for sure  
I would live and die for you and I know just what to do when you call me,baby  
  
Don't say good-bye,say your gonna stay forever  
All, all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Can you fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough  
It's never over,yesterday's just a memory away  
  
I was running for the door  
And next thing I remember  
I was running back for more  
  
Don't say good-bye,say your gonna stay forever  
All, all the way  
  
Can you take me high enough  
Can you fly me over yesterday  
Can you take me high enough

I flip the switch on my laser video  
And there's the man staring back at me  
He starts to speak in a voice so righteous  
About the sins of society  
  
He's got answers to all my problems  
Says he'll decide what I should hear and see  
I try to change to another station  
But all I get is more of his morality  
And morality, yeah  
  
But I see the kids of a new generation  
And they won't stand for this mind control  
They're gonna change this world we live in  
They're gonna bring back the rock and roll  
  
So if I can, I'm gonna break from this prison  
Gonna get out and join in the fight  
Take a chance on what I believe in  
Win or lose, I know it's right

For us to start a revolution

I woke up this morning  
Wishing you were here  
Another cup of coffee  
And then you appeared  
  
A crystal vision  
Shining through the rain  
Smiling through my window pane  
  
In the morning traffic  
I turn on the radio  
And the song that's playing  
Is one that we used to know  
  
When we were dancing slowly  
Under the mirror ball  
You were singing to me  
I felt like we had it all  
  
It was our adventure  
I won't let it slip away  
Gonna make it like it was before this day  
  
I will be your witness  
(That much I can do) That much I can do  
(I want to tell the world) I just want to tell the world  
How much I'm missing you  
  
I will be your witness  
(Don't you know it's true) Don't you know it's true  
(I want to testify) I just want to testify  
How much I'm loving you  
  
Did you ever notice  
Just what you mean to me  
You're the piece of the puzzle  
That makes my world complete  
  
I need your freedom  
I need your company  
Let me tell you how it's going to be  
  
I will be your witness  
(That much I can do) That much I can do  
(I want to tell the world) I just want to tell the world  
How much I'm missing you  
  
I'll be your alibi tonight  
I'll make everything all right  
I will be your defense  
When life makes no sense  
Baby you just wait and see  
It's a crazy crazy world  
  
Woke up this morning  
Wishing you were here  
Poured a cup of coffee  
And then you appeared  
  
Such a great adventure  
I won't let it slip away  
You know I need you every night and every day  
  
I will be your witness  
(That much I can do) That much I can do  
(I want to tell the world) I just want to tell the world  
How much I'm missing you  
  
I will be your witness  
(Don't you know it's true) Don't you know it's true  
(I want to testify) I just want to testify  
How much I'm loving you  
  
I will be your witness (I will be your witness)  
What else can I do (What else can I do)  
I just want to tell the world  
How much I'm loving you

Every day I get the feeling  
When you move on down the street  
Wondering when I'll be your lover  
And you'll make my dream complete  
  
The way you walk is so inviting  
That I quiver and I shake  
The way you move it makes me wonder  
How much more can I take  
  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Basically that's what I say  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Cause you want it just that way  
  
Every time that we're together  
My head starts to rock and roll  
I get this strange electric feeling  
That I simply can't control  
  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Basically that's what I say  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
Cause you want it just that way  
  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
I'm gonna make you feel it  
I'm gonna make you feel it

sometimes it's hard to smile  
keep looking back  
searching for somebody  
who once was in your life  
baby let him go now  
there'll be something better ahead  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you  
  
we all have tears to cry  
but there comes a day  
to leave your tears behind you  
and give your heart  
someplace to start  
and if you find your way there  
there'll be someone waiting for you  
  
it takes love to make love  
you can't hide behind your broken heart  
  
it takes love to make love  
let the light of another lover shine on you

that flows  
to the sea  
  
don't wait

Jennifer  
She drinks her sherry wine  
She keeps her lady's love for me all the time  
She's seventeen, barely old enough to cry  
A child in her father's eyes  
A woman every night  
  
Her love,  
Gives me the power  
Her dreams carry me on  
Jennifer, so inviting  
That I sing  
  
Jennifer  
She took me by surprise  
She told me that she's much too young to keep me satisfied  
Jennifer, ah so delicate and shy  
A child in her mother's eyes but  
A woman every night  
  
Her love,  
Gives me the power  
Her dreams carry me on  
Jennifer, so inviting  
That I sing

Anne Bonny kept him company  
  
The skull and crossbones flew  
Above the ocean blue  
The captain's men where a pirate's crew  
  
The ships they sought to take  
Were of the Spanish Main  
A gift from Ferdinand of Spain  
  
And though you rob and kill to find your dream  
Your crimes are hardly what they seem  
  
Tortuga held the treasure of a thousand kings  
So Jonas planned to steal everything  
  
Two hundred men stood guard  
Around the fortune's nest  
But Psalter's steel slew all the rest  
  
And when the smoke had cleared  
And bloody bodies lay  
Everyone could hear the minstrel play  
  
Woo woo Jonas Psalter  
You've captured every prize  
There is to dream of in one life  
  
And so we wonder why  
We found you in your bed  
With that bullet in your head

Brick by brick you built a mansion  
Piece by piece it seems  
You're tearing it down  
  
Once you walked so tall and handsome  
Now nobody even wants you around  
Now you're just some kind of  
Leftover clown  
Now you're like Quasi Modo crying  
  
As you look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin  
  
Reaching for Venus De Milo  
But she's never gonna hold you tight  
You plant plutonium silos  
Then you blister from the sun that's too bright  
Like a vampire stepping into the light  
Just a victim of your own greed as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Killing the world that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin  
  
The genius of a generation  
Blown away just like a leaf on the wind  
And now you're looking for salvation  
But you can't forget the places you've been  
And you can't erase a lifetime of sin  
And you can't escape the answers as you  
  
Look in the mirror  
At what you've become  
Dredging the river for what you have done  
Killing the thing that you love  
Like Lennon's assassin  
Lennon's assassin

Krakatoa you've changed your ways  
from evil days.  
Oh I know a once violent isle  
and gentle smile.  
When the dust and lava cooled  
you were sterile as the rock from which the earth was tooled.  
Was man's beginning a wind borne spore  
to fly no more?  
Nature's winning her docile spree  
has set her free.  
Seeds were wafted on the wind  
forming heavy undergrowth for species winged and finned.  
Tangled mangles rebuilt your soil  
from age dead toil.  
Sheltered bay coves protecting life  
from Satan's knife.  
Grow and island in the sun  
where the hell fire belching earth had destructively left none.

Lady when you're with me I'm smiling  
Give me all your love  
Your hands build me up when I'm sinking  
Touch me and my troubles all fade  
  
Lady from the moment I saw you standing all alone  
You gave all the love that I needed  
She's so shy like a child who has grown  
You're my  
  
Lady of the morning  
Love shines in your eyes  
Sparkling, clear and lovely  
You're my lady  
  
Lady turn me on when I'm lonely  
Show me all your charms  
Evenings when you lay down beside me  
Just take me gently into your arms  
You're my.  
  
Lady of the morning  
Love shines in your eyes  
Sparkling, clear and lovely  
You're my lady

I heard the knock on my door  
I heard the ring of the bell  
I got the letter but I couldn't go  
So many thoughts in my head  
So many places to be  
So many faces that I long to see  
Standing in front of me tonight  
The lights will take me where I long to be  
Just like a thousand nights before  
Somebody said to me  
Why do you do this to you  
Why sit back and relax  
Go to the islands and forget it all  
  
Slow down, you're moving too fast  
You seem afraid it won't last  
Take my advice, go straight and settle down  
Thank you for caring, but tonight the lights will take me where I long to be  
Just like a thousand nights before  
I can't explain, it gives me something  
  
Give me the lights, precious lights  
Give me lights  
Give me my hope, give me my energy  
You can turn the wrong into right  
Precious lights  
Illuminate me, carry me away  
Carry me, carry me

Somebody lookin' for the answer,  
Somebody dyin' to cut a deal  
Somebody got a cure to cancer,  
Somebody drunk behind the wheel  
But me, I'm just tryin' to find my little Suzie  
  
Somebody bustin' illegal aliens,  
Somebody burnin' Hollywood  
Somebody tryin' to shoot the president,  
Someone abused and misunderstood  
But, me, I'm just holding up a sign for little Suzie  
  
Somebody reachin' out for Jesus,  
Somebody lookin' for a sign  
Somebody said they spotted Elvis,  
He was healin' the sick and leadin' the blind  
But me, I'm just tryin' to make some time for my little Suzie  
Yeah me, I'm sneakin' up behind, don't you hear me say  
  
I won't surrender, I will survive, so help me Jesus  
We'll be together until the end of all space and time  
  
Everybody's got an infomercial,  
Everybody's psychic on the phone  
Somebody had a sex change reversal,  
Somebody thinks nobody knows  
Somebody cryin' out for justice,  
Somebody shootin' someone's kid  
Somebody caught the perpetrator,  
Somebody swears they never did  
But me, I'm just makin' time for my little Suzie  
Yeah me, I'm playin' my guitar for my little Suzie  
  
The world is gonna turn from here until doomsday  
But I don't give a damn long as I've got little Suzie  
  
I won't surrender, I will survive, so help me Jesus  
We'll be together until the end of all space and time  
  
Somebody's awaiting execution,  
Somebody's dyin' to pull the switch  
Somebody cries another martyr,  
Somebody screams "fry the son of a bitch"  
But me, I'm just spending time with little Suzie  
Yeah me, I'm playing my guitar for little Suzie  
Oh me, I'm safe in the arms of little Suzie

In the shuffling madness of the locomotive breath  
Runs the all time loser, head long to his death  
He feels the piston scraping, steam breaking on his brow  
Old Charlie stole the handle and the train  
It won't stop going, no way to slow down  
He sees his children jumpin' off at stations, one by one  
His woman and his best friend in bed and havin' fun  
Oh, he's crawling down the corridor on his hands and knees  
Old Charlie stole the handle and the train  
It won't stop going, no way to slow down  
Hey, hey, [Incomprehensible], ooh  
Charlie, Charlie, Charlie  
He hears the silence howling, catches angels as they fall  
And the all time winner, has got him by the balls  
Oh, he picks up Gideons Bible, open at page one  
But, God, he stole the handle and the train  
It won't stop going, no way to slow down  
No way to slow down, no way to slow down  
No way to slow down, no way to slow down, yeah  
Charlie stole the handle, no way to slow down  
No way to slow down, Charlie stole the handle  

Lonely child you make it easy  
You give me love like no one can  
You're my heart, you keep me movin'  
It seems you always understand  
My love, I'm your man  
  
Lonely child you make me happy  
You take my fears and set them free  
Every night you hold me closer  
Like two notes in harmony  
Come spend your life with me  
  
Lonely child be my lover  
We'll make love in the morning light  
Weave your magic spell around me  
And come spend your life with me

"Hey , Hey out there knock it off will ya?  
Hey give it a rest will ya? I'm tryin' to get some sleep!  
Want me to call the cops?  
I tell ya Erma I can't till next week when they start to tear that damn old
theatre down."  
  
The rain was hot, the streets were empty  
As downtown closed her eyes  
The movie house stood in silence as I said my last good-byes  
Her silver screen was stained with memories  
As Cagney shot them down  
And as I watched I was that hero  
In dreamlands lost and found  
  
Oh my God, well we both are empty Paradise and me  
Do you believe I'm still chasing rainbows  
When everywhere I see  
  
Lonely People, Lonely People  
Up above these ghetto streets  
In penthouse suites they sit and stare  
Lonely People, Lonely People  
They smile and say they're fine  
But behind their eyes they just don't care  
Lonely People  
They just don't care  
Lonely People, Lonely People  
  
Lonely People, Lonely People  
Beneath these neon streets in subway seats they crowd for air  
Lonely People, Lonely People  
So close and yet so far they share the secrets of despair  
Lonely People, Lonely People (repeat and fade...)

All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the music in their story  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the lands of ancient glory  
  
In the year of the Lords  
The message came from above  
The heavens opened with their mighty sound  
that shook the people in the town  
  
And so we came from everywhere  
The young and old the rich and poor  
To hear the legend of the magic ring  
and of the powers it could bring, they sing  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the music in their story  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery it brings  
May we someday wear its glory  
  
And now the message is clear  
For I became a Lord this year  
And though the legend was pure fantasy  
We still need the hope it brings, so let's sing  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To believe is a wonderous thing  
May we always sing their glory  
  
All hail to the Lords of the Ring  
To the magic and mystery they bring  
To the promise of their story

When I think of Lorelei, my head turns all around  
As gentle as a butterfly, she moves without a sound  
I call her on the telephone, she says be there by eight  
Tonight's the night she's movin' in and I can hardly wait  
  
The way she moves, ooh-ooh-ooh, I gotta say  
  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Oh baby, forever  
  
Her eyes become a paradise, she softly speaks my name  
She brightens every lonely night, no one's quite the same  
She calls me on the telephone, she says be there by eight  
Tonight's the night she's movin' in, it's time to celebrate  
  
The way she moves, ooh-ooh-ooh, I gotta say  
  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Baby, baby, forever  
  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever  
Lorelei, let's live together  
Brighter than the stars, forever

The time is now to take my wares to the street  
And I know how, the street's been good to me  
Maybe it's the sign of a wise man  
Maybe it's the sign of a fool  
Maybe it's the night for a rendezvous with a woman like you  
  
It's gone too far, I'll take my life into the streets  
I feel the need and I can't stop myself  
Maybe it's time to be a strong man  
Maybe it's time to be cool  
Maybe I'll take to the boulevard  
Where there's nothing I won't do  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love in the midnight  
There's a burning in my body  
And I'm looking for love in the midnight  
  
Better hold on tight, I'm a ravenous man  
I'll tell you anything to make you think I'm alright  
You know the moonlight brings out the devil in me  
For tomorrow, I'll regret it in the daylight  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love in the midnight  
Won't you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love  
  
Better hold on tight, I'm a ravenous man  
I'll tell you anything to make you think I'm alright  
You know the moonlight brings out the devil in me  
For tomorrow, I'll regret it in the daylight  
  
Can you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love in the midnight  
There's a burning in my body  
And I'm looking for love in the midnight  
Won't you tell me where my heart is  
When I'm looking for love

Tell me where are you going  
Sweet mademoiselle  
To London or Paris  
To the Grand Hotel  
  
Where do you go at the end of the day  
Where do you go, when you spend time away  
To islands in the tropic sands  
Or pleasure trips to distant lands  
You're searching for a dream  
Well maybe it's me.  
  
I tell you hello  
And what do you say  
As I stop you go  
There's no reason to stay  
  
It all began so harmlessly  
You gave me love so easily  
I never realized you were just spending time  
  
Tell me where are you going  
Sweet mademoiselle  
To London or Paris  
To the Grand Hotel  
  
Even though you're far away  
I think about you every day  
And wonder if you're thinking of me  
In a fond memory  
Sweet mademoiselle  
  
Tell me where are you going  
Sweet mademoiselle  
To London or Paris  
Ou Montreal  
Sweet Mademoiselle

Another year has passed me by  
Still I look a myself and cry  
What kind of man have I become?  
All of the years I've spent in search of myself  
And I'm still in the dark  
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone  
  
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
I'm a lonely soldier off to war  
Sent away to die, never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all  
  
Ten Thousand people look my way  
But they can't see the way that I feel  
Nobody even cares to try  
I spend my life and sell my soul on the road  
And I'm still in the dark  
'Cause I can't seem to find the light alone  
  
Sometimes I feel like a man in the wilderness  
I'm a lonely sailor lost at sea  
Drifting with the tide  
Never quite knowing why  
Sometimes it makes no sense at all  
  
(I'm alive)  
Looking for love I'm a man with emotion  
(And my heart's on fire)  
I'm dying of thirst in the middle of the ocean  
I'm alive!

He was a man of miracles  
  
Fighting the solar windstorm  
A winged horse guides his way  
Oracle of the ancient midnight  
Calls forth everlasting pain  
  
And I know, yes I know  
He was a man of miracles  
Riding golden meteorites  
Ruler of distant galaxies  
Born of the northern lights  
Of the northern lights  
  
Sorcerer of the dark moon  
Who dare incur his rage?  
First child of the scorpion  
Prophet of the crystal age  
  
And I know, yes I know  
He was a man of miracles  
Riding golden meteorites  
Ruler of distant galaxies  
Born of the northern lights  
Of the northern lights  
  
He was a man of miracles

Gonna get you while you sleep  
Give you a dream you can keep  
To yourself little mama gonna make you feel better  
  
I'm your mystery man in a gold Lincoln  
Ain't no reason to do any second thinkin'  
About it child  
  
Midnight ride I'm gonna shake ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna break ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna take you on a  
Midnight ride  
  
Meet you little girl back at my hotel  
Between you and me we're really gonna give 'em hell  
  
I got something mighty special up my sleeve  
All you got to do is just say please  
  
Midnight ride I'm gonna shake ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna break ya  
Midnight ride I'm gonna take you on a  
Midnight ride

You were the apple of the public's eye as you cut the ribbon at the local mall  
A mirage for both you and us. How can it be real?  
We love your body in that photograph, your home state sure must be proud  
The queen of the United States, or have you lost your crown  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America  
Our love  
  
Well are you really who we think you are  
Or does that smile seem to wear you down  
This girl who you once were is screaming jump out  
This dream that you must live, a disease for which there is no cure  
This roller coaster ride you're on won't stop to let you off  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America  
Our love  
  
Miss America, Miss America  
Miss America, Miss America  
  
Well it's true just take a look  
The cover sometimes makes the book  
And the judges, do they ever ask to read between your lines  
And in your cage at the human zoo, they all stop to look at you  
Next year, what will you do when you have been forgotten  
  
Well aren't you Miss America  
Don't you Miss America  
Won't you Miss America  
Our love

You're wondering who I am-machine or mannequin  
With parts made in Japan, I am the modern man  
  
I've got a secret I've been hiding under my skin  
My heart is human, my blood is boiling, my brain I.B.M.  
So if you see me acting strangely, don't be surprised  
I'm just a man who needed someone, and somewhere to hide  
To keep me alive, just keep me alive  
Somewhere to hide to keep me alive  
  
I'm not a robot without emotions, I'm not what you see  
I've come to help you with your problems, so we can be free  
I'm not a hero, I'm not a savior, forget what you know  
I'm just a man whose circumstances went beyond his control  
Beyond my control, we all need control  
I need control, we all need control  
  
I am the modern man, who hides behind a mask  
So no one else can see my true identity  
  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo, domo  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto, domo, domo  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto  
Domo arigato, Mr. Roboto  
  
Thank you very much, Mr. Roboto  
For doing the jobs nobody wants to  
And thank you very much, Mr. Roboto  
For helping me escape to where I needed to  
Thank you, thank you, thank you  
I want to thank you, please, thank you, oh yeah  
  
The problem's plain to see, too much technology  
Machines to save our lives. Machines dehumanize.  
  
The time has come at last  
To throw away this mask  
Now everyone can see  
My true identity  
I'm Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy! Kilroy!

I like music,  
The rhythm really gets to me  
I can't control it,  
My feet move automatically  
And I like hot licks  
The kind I wish that I could play  
And when I hear them  
I crank the volume all the way  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it up  
Turn it loud  
All the way  
  
I like strangers  
Their kindness means a lot to me  
They don't ask questions  
Don't care about my history  
And I like fast girls  
I don't know what's come over me  
They make me do things  
I would not ordinarily  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it up  
Turn it loud  
All the way  
  
Hear it, feel it, like it  
Do it, do it, do it to me  
Want it, need it, love it  
Can't get enough of it  
Try it do it  
Go ahead and go for it  
All the way  
  
And I like daydreams  
I've had enough reality  
My job is boring  
I'm overworked and underpaid  
I like TV  
It stirs up all my fantasies  
Girls in tight jeans  
Acting so outrageously  
  
Turn it on  
Turn it up  
Turn it loud  
All the way  
  
Hear it, feel it, like it  
Do it, do it, do it to me  
Want it, need it, love it  
Can't get enough of it  
Try it do it  
Go ahead and go for it  
All the way  
  
Turn it loose, loose  
I like big things  
The size of them impresses me  
Just give me plenty  
Forget about the quality  
And I like fast food  
The burgers always taste the same  
The snotty waiters  
Ask highball or boubiley

Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way  
  
You think that you could never love again  
The one time really tore you apart  
So don't even try to touch your heart  
You're never going to give it again  
  
Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way  
  
You think that too much joy can only bring pain  
Before you know it, it can be gone  
But give me a chance to prove you're wrong  
You'll never say never again  
  
Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way  
  
Take time to smell the roses  
Don't hold back your one chance  
It hardly lasts, it hardly lasts  
Better, better believe in forever  
  
Out here I stand with my heart in my hand  
My hopes on a wing and a prayer  
I must have been born with a hole in my head  
Cause I've never said these things before  
  
Never, never, never say never  
Ne dis jamais jamais  
Better, better believe in forever  
And it can be that way

What'cha going to do when the sun goes down tonight  
You'll hit the same old clubs, rap that same old trash  
That's right  
You've got them real silk shirts and them baggy pants  
Dago shoes in the colors that match  
But the girls are acting bored  
And you're feeling like you're going to lose  
You've got the G.Q. Blues  
  
You get up every morning and you go to work each day  
(you go to work, you go to work, you go to work)  
Been doing the same damn job for ten long years this May  
(you've got to work, you've got to work, you've got to work)  
You've been working and saving for your Jamaican dream  
Paradise is waiting across the sea  
But when your plane lands Montego turns to Monsoon  
You've got the Island Blues  
  
'Cause, nothing ever goes as planned  
It's a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
You're so together and you act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong you're still surprised  
You've done your duty, you've paid a fortune in dues  
Still got those Mother Nature's Blues  
  
I strut around the stage like a little king tonight  
They'll scream for every word and every note, that's right  
But when the show is over and I'm all alone  
Can't reach my baby on the telephone  
And everywhere I look Mr. Loneliness is in the news  
I've got the Big Star Blues  
  
Boy, nothing ever goes as planned  
It's a hell of a notion  
Even Pharaohs turn to sand  
Like a drop in the ocean  
I'm so together and I act so civilized  
But every time that things go wrong  
I'm still surprised  
I've done my duty and paid a fortune in dues  
Still got them Mother Nature's Blues

You can't be still  
You're such a nervous fellow  
Like a yo-yo  
Up and down  
  
Take this little pill  
And life will be so mellow  
You'll feel the world  
Start slowing down around  
  
Who's that rushing out the door  
Who's not taking any more  
Who's been down this road before  
Without you  
  
You tell me who's number one  
Who's not here  
Who's having fun  
Who's the one who cares this much  
About you  
  
You won't feel the pain  
You won't mind the rain  
You can be happy all the time  
All the time  
One dose twice a day  
The world will go away  
You'll be smiling through  
The worst of times  
Who's that rushing out the door  
Who's not taking any more  
Who's been down this road before  
Without you  
  
You tell me who's number one  
Who's not here  
Who's having fun  
Who's the one  
Who knows so much about you  
  
I believe I belive  
There's something more  
I believe it's just beyond the door  
I believe there's something more  
I believe it's just  
Beyond the door  
I believe there's something  
Better out there  
  
Want to leave this world  
So far behind  
I can see your face there  
In my mind  
I believe there's something  
Better our there  
  
Who's that rushing  
Who's not taking  
Who's been down this  
You tell me who's  
Who's not here who's  
Who's the one who  
  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better  
Something better

"...everybody plays this one right, everybody gets a fresh, hot latte and a
scone..."  
  
Oh what a beautiful night  
Couldn't get any clearer  
Yeah what a wonderful sight  
My old life in the rear view mirror  
  
Hey now I'm travelin' light  
Duffel bag and a six string  
Yeah but it feels so right  
To hear the bells of freedom ring  
  
Gotta get away from  
The same old same  
Let a new day come  
Start over again  
  
Hey I was stuck in a grind  
Little fish in a little pond  
If I had a criminal mind  
I'd have got myself a gun  
  
Had to get away from  
The ball and chain  
Let a new day come  
Or start goin' insane  
  
I'm on my way  
Don't know to where  
But I'm gonna get there  
  
On my way  
Look at the world  
With my brand new eyes  
  
I can't believe I feel so high  
I'm on my way tonight  
  
Hey I was going to seed  
Spreading out like a corn field  
I had so much denial to feed  
I was full of nothing real  
  
I had to get away from  
My old routine  
Let a new day come  
Start over again  
  
I'm on my way  
I don't know to where  
But I'm gonna get there  
  
On my way  
Look at the world  
Through my brand new eyes  
  
I can't believe I get to feel  
So good  
So high tonight  
  
Starting tonight  
There will be  
A revival  
In my world  
  
Turn on the lights  
And you'll see  
This one man band  
Is now a symphony  
  
And the sun  
Is gonna shine  
Like a summer time  
That has no end  
  
And the love  
I will find  
I have no doubt  
That it will be mine  
The love I find  
Will all be mine  
  
I had to get away while  
I could still be saved  
Let a new day come  
Stop digging my grave  
  
On my way...  
I have faith  
The road up ahead  
Gonna get much easier  
  
On my way  
Look at me now  
With a brand new life  
  
I can't believe I feel so high  
I'm on my way tonight  
  
"...'scuse me, waitress, latte's and scones for everybody!..."

It's six o'clock  
Good morning sounds are everywhere  
The warmth of spring, a gentle breeze blows through my hair  
  
I hurry through my life never stopping to see  
How beautiful it was meant to be  
  
I'm just a prisoner in a king's disguise  
Broken dreams as we shuffle by  
  
It's six o'clock it's quitting time I'm done for the day  
Out on the streets I overheard a lady say  
We now have everything or so people say  
But now this emptiness haunts me every day  
We seek the lion's share never knowing why  
Come alive spread your wings and fly  
  
Pieces of eight  
The search for the money tree  
Don't cash your freedoms in for gold  
Pieces of eight  
Can't buy you everything  
Don't let it turn your heart to stone

It was 'bout 15 years ago  
Just about this time  
The child we both were waiting for  
Soon opened his eyes  
First the cough and then the pain  
Showed within your face  
I felt the cold mist round your hand  
Like death was in its place  
  
Lord, Lord take my hand  
Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
I'll be with you in the sunshine, sand  
  
I called the doctor to your side  
He knelt down by your bed  
He looked at you, he held your hand  
Then he shook his head  
The child you want won't give the love  
You both want to get  
As your wife come quickly now  
Cos she has not long to live  
He said--  
  
Lord, Lord take my hand  
Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
I'll be with you in the sunshine, sand  
  
Every day I go to kiss, the ground in which you lay  
Your golden hair has turned to dust  
Your smile has turned to clay  
The pain I felt for 15 years  
This life won't take a win  
And I will lie within your arms  
By the evening of this day  
  
Lord, Lord take my hand  
Take me down to the promised land  
Ever since you died my heart has died  
I'll be with you in the sunshine, sand

Put me on I'm your brand new record album  
Side one, cut one listen to the songs  
Play me loud don't you worry 'bout your nieghbors  
Hope I make you feel good all day long  
All day long  
  
Put me on and play me loud  
I'm the madman screaming in your living room  
I'll soon be coming to your town  
To sing and play a little tune  
  
I said put me on and play me loud  
Turn your stereo up all the way  
All the way  
Now your body's immersed in sound  
So hear the synthesizers play  
  
And now you're in the mood  
Let the melody just drift your cares away  
It's got to do you good  
As it mesmerizes you in its own way  
So drift away

Day into night she's with me  
How sweet is her warm embrace  
Safe in the scent of jasmine  
So safe in her gold and lace  
  
Mornings I find, she's left me  
So cold so alone, but aware  
I try to escape, she finds me  
Oh run though I may, she's there, there, there, there, there  
  
Luck is a lady whose smile is as cold as a stone  
She'll bring you things, many things you might never have known  
But when your die is cast she'll have the final laugh at you  
She'll lock you in a duel, where you come out the fool  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widow's curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death  
  
Day into night she's with me  
Turn of a card, she's there  
The first time is free, you know  
But from now on, pay me, me, me, me, me  
  
Beware of the Queen of Spades  
Her black widow's curse might find you yet  
Beware of a love that you will regret  
Her love means only your death

Oh Mama I'm in fear for my life  
From the long arm of the law  
Lawman has put an end to my running  
And I'm so far from my home  
Oh mama I can hear you a crying  
You're so scared and all alone  
Hangman is coming down from the gallows  
And I don't have very long  
  
(YEAH!)  
The jig is up the news is out  
They've finally found me  
The renegade who had it made  
Retrieved for a bounty  
Never more to go astray  
This will be the end today of the wanted man  
  
Whoa mama I've been years on the lam  
And had a high price on my head  
Lawman said get him dead or alive  
Now it's for sure he'll see me dead  
  
Dear mama I can hear you a crying  
You're so scared and all alone  
Hangman is coming down from the gallows  
And I don't have very long  
  
The jig is up the news is out  
They've finally found me  
The renegade who had it made  
Retrieved for a bounty  
Never more to go astray  
The judge will have revenge today  
On the wanted man

I have seen you  
walk in my dreams  
casted high against the sky  
  
let me meet you  
let me greet you inside  
take your place right next to mine  
  
yes I say  
  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
  
leaves have fallen  
since I saw you last  
slowly die from green to brown  
in which way we choose  
to live our lives again  
  
I'm gonna lay some seeds  
I'm gonna leave them laying right on the ground  
  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away  
right away, right away

So whatcha doin' tonight?  
Have you heard that the world's gone crazy?  
Young Americans listen when I say there's people puttin' us down  
I know they're sayin' that we've gone lazy  
To tell you the truth we've all seen better days  
Don't need no fast buck lame duck profits for fun  
Quick trick plans, take the money and run  
We need long term, slow burn, getting it done  
And some straight talking, hard working son of a gun.  
Whatcha doin' tonight, I got faith in our generation  
Let's stick together and futurize our attitudes  
I ain't lookin' to fight, but I know with determination  
We can challenge the schemers who cheat all the rules  
  
Come on take pride, be wise, spottin' the fools  
No more big shots, crackpots bending the rules  
A fair shot here for me and for you  
Knowing that we can't lose  
  
And we'll be rockin' in Paradise  
Rockin' the Paradise tonight  
Rockin' in Paradise  
Rockin' the Paradise tonight  
Tonight, tonight...

I tried to be the perfect soldier  
I tried to be what everyone said was expected  
Somehow I was selected  
Well, my hands were steady, my aim was true  
But deep inside of my heart I knew  
That I lacked the will  
I just couldn't shoot to kill  
  
And still she treats me like a human  
She says she'll still be there  
I may not be a hero, but I'll be there  
Because I know she cares  
  
I worked hard to be the greatest lover  
I wanted to be sure that I was her only one  
That's how I thought it was done  
But I went too far, assumed too much  
The need to feel a younger one's touch  
Seemed important then  
Oh what a fool I've been  
  
And still she treats me like a human (like a human)  
She says she'll still be there (that she'll be there)  
I don't quite understand it, she's been too fair  
'Cause somehow she cares  
  
I guess that's the way it goes, the way that it goes  
And nobody knows what compels her  
She's seen my highs and lows and never let go  
  
Oh yes she treats me like a human (like a human)  
She says she'll still be there (that she'll be there)  
I don't quite understand it, she's been too fair  
'Cause somehow she cares  
  
I guess that's the way it goes, the way that it goes  
And nobody knows what compels her  
She's seen my highs and lows and never let go  
  
And when the world has turned its back on me  
I won't have to feel alone  
'Cause I know she cares

Every night I say a prayer in the hope that there's a heaven  
And every day I'm more confused as the saints turn into sinners  
All the heroes and legends I knew as a child have fallen to idols of clay  
And I feel this empty place inside so afraid that I've lost my faith  
  
Show me the way, show me the way  
Take me tonight to the river  
And wash my illusions away  
Show me the way  
  
And as I slowly drift to sleep, for a moment dreams are sacred  
I close my eyes and know there's peace in a world so filled with hatred  
That I wake up each morning and turn on the news to find we've so far to go  
And I keep on hoping for a sign, so afraid that I just won't know  
  
Show me the way, Show me the way  
Take me tonight to the mountain  
And take my confusion away  
  
And if I feel light, should I believe  
Tell me how will I know  
  
Show me the way, show me the way  
Take me tonight to the river  
And wash my illusions away  
Show me the way, show me the way  
Give me the strength and the courage  
To believe that I'll get there someday  
Show me the way  
  
Every night I say a prayer  
In the hope that there's a heaven

Hannah you're with me in spirit wherever I go  
To the ends of the earth and all points between high and low  
Each night by the stage you appear as you are  
The ever intangible child  
Ageless and timeless as Dorian Grey  
Oh Hannah I know that it's you and you're leading me on  
  
Hannah you're my inspiration my fountain of youth  
And as your surrogate leader I'm bound in your searach for the truth  
And yes how the truth rushes out  
When it's become honestly clear  
I see your anxious and curious eyes  
But Hannah I need you as much as you think you need me  
Come to your window tonight and we'll fly to your dreams  
And we'll  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life  
  
Hannah don't fail me I need you like never before  
Father time's at my back on my heels  
Behind every door (and he says)  
Son when the youth has but gone from your face  
Will she let you grow older with grace?  
Or will she give you up for one younger than you?  
Oh Hannah please tell me the things that he says are untrue  
Hannah I'm honestly hoping you'll always be there  
  
Sing for the day sing for the moment  
Sing for the time of your life  
Come for an hour stay for a moment  
Stay for the rest of your life

First met you in a southern town  
On a warm November day  
You made me smoke like a whirlwind  
I knew we had nothing to say  
Love me but don't try and make me stay  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Once again in the early spring  
I touched your raven's crown  
Your wild eyed stories of rare delight  
Like to knock me down  
It's getting so damn hard to put you down  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Southern woman  
Take my soul but don't you take my life  
Southern woman  
Make me feel good but don't you tell my wife  
  
Southern woman  
Yeah

Time after time I sit and I wait for your call  
I know I'm a fool but why can I say  
Whatever the price I'll pay for you, Madame Blue  
Once long ago, a word from your lips and the world turned around  
But somehow you've changed, you're so far away  
I long for the past and dream of the days with you, Madame Blue  
  
Suite Madame Blue, gaze in your looking glass  
You're not a child anymore  
Suite Madame Blue, the future is all but past  
Dressed in your jewels, you made your own rules  
You conquered the world and more heaven's door  
  
America, America, America, America  
America, America, America, America  
America, America, America, America  
  
Red white and blue, gaze in your looking glass  
You're not a child anymore  
Red, white, and blue, the future is all but past  
So lift up your heart, make a new start  
And lead us away from here

Hot town, summer in the city  
Back of my neck gettin' dirty 'n' gritty  
Been down, isn't it a pity  
Doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city  
All around people lookin' half dead  
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head  
But at night it's a different world  
Go out and find a girl  
Come on, come on and dance all night  
Despite the heat, it'll be alright  
Babe, don't you know it's a pity  
The days can't be like the nights  
In the summer, in the city  
In the summer, in the city  
Cool town, evening in the city  
Dressed so fine and looking so pretty  
Cool cat, looking for a kitty  
Gonna look in every corner of the city  
Till I'm wheezing like a bus stop  
Runnin' upstairs, sayin' meet you on the roof top  
But at night it's a different world  
Go out and find a girl  
Come on, come on and dance all night  
Despite the heat, it'll be alright  
Babe, don't you know it's a pity  
And the days can't be like the nights  
In the summer, in the city  
In the summer, in the city  
Hot town, summer in the city  
Back of my neck gettin' dirty 'n' gritty  
Been down, isn't it a pity  
But doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city  
All around people lookin' half dead  
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head  
But at night it's a different world  
Go out and find a girl  
Come on, come on and dance all night  
Despite the heat, it'll be alright  
Babe, don't you know it's a pity  
The days can't be like the nights  
In the summer, in the city  
In the summer, in the city  
Hot city  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
In the city  

You've read about me in the papers  
You've seen me on the movie screen  
You know everything about me  
I'm your late night fantasy  
  
But don't think I can't hear you calling  
From the shadow of the 14th row  
Cause I've had the same dreams you've had  
A few short years ago and that's why I know  
  
You and I  
We will climb so high  
Superstars  
Whoa whoa you and I  
  
And we'll just close our eyes  
And we'll become our fantasy  
  
Superstars yes, yes, superstars  
Step right this way. Everyone's welcome,  
We want your dreams.  
The offer's simple, momentary immortality  
  
Cause I've seen them all you know  
I've seen them climb and I've seen them fall  
I've seen them come and I've seen them go  
And through it all there's only one thing that matters  
  
Love  
And that's simply  
You and I  
Yes, You and I  
For we are superstars

Talkin' about the good times  
Talkin' about the good  
Talkin' about the good times  
Talkin' about the good times  
  
She had sun in her face  
Her lips kiss the sun  
Arrest the sun  
Fields of light we found the place  
  
She had sun in her eyes  
The clouds crossed the sun  
Without the sun  
This evening shadows in her eyes  
  
Talkin' about the good times  
Talkin' about the good  
Talkin' about the good times  
Talkin' about the good times  
  
She had breaded her hair  
The grass jumped through the rain  
Reach to the rain  
Tears of mystic rain in the air  
  
She had tears in her eyes  
The skies turned to gray  
Melt away  
Shining streaks in rain that day  
  
Talkin' about the good times  
Talkin' about the good  
Talkin' about the good times  
Talkin' about the good times  
  
Good times  
Good times  
Good times  
Good times  
Good times

Tonight's the night we'll make history. Honey you and I.  
And I'll take any risk to tie back the hands of time,  
And stay with you here tonight (with you tonight, with you tonight)  
  
I know you feel these are the worst of times. I do believe it's true.  
When people lock their doors, and hide inside.  
Rumor has it it's the end of Paradise.  
  
But I know, if the world just passed us by, baby I know  
I wouldn't have to cry  
  
[Chorus]  
The best of times, are when I'm alone with you.  
Some rain some shine, we'll make this a world for two.  
Our memories of yesterday will last a lifetime  
We'll take the best forget the rest and some day we'll find  
  
These are the best of times  
These are the best of times  
  
The headlines read "These Are The Worst Of Times", I do believe it's true.  
I feel so helpless like a boat against the tide.  
I wish the summer winds could bring back paradise.  
  
But I know, if the world turned upside down, baby I know  
You'd always be around  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(When I'm alone with you, you brighten up the night! )  
(When I'm alone with you...)

Welcome to the Grand illusion  
Come on in and see what's happening  
Pay the price, get your tickets for the show  
The stage is set, the band starts playing  
Suddenly your heart is pounding  
Wishing secretly you were a star.  
  
But don't be fooled by the radio  
The TV or the magazines  
They show you photographs of how your life should be  
But they're just someone else's fantasy  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because you never win the game  
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion  
And deep inside we're all the same.  
We're all the same  
  
So if you think your life is complete confusion  
Because your neighbors got it made  
Just remember that it's a Grand illusion  
And deep inside we're all the same.  
We're all the same  
  
America spells competition, join us in our blind ambition  
Get yourself a brand new motor car  
Someday soon we'll stop to ponder what on Earth's this spell we're under  
We made the grade and still we wonder who the hell we are

Hey you there  
Cast an eye this way  
You with that young lust virgin smile  
Don't pretend that you're quickly melting before my eyes  
That's a lie  
  
'Cause I see all of you  
Quite clearly now  
I like our looks your moves you know everything  
So when I ring you up in the evening I shall meet you  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
Just south of man's delight  
Close to a soft flowing stream  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
We will join as lovers might  
Between the lines of a dream  
  
Your magic lips  
Have made me realize  
All of the pleasures man can fantasize  
So don't pretend that you're sad to see me say goodbye  
That's a lie  
  
You're a wicked wench...ha  
But thanks for all the laughs  
You and your young lust virgin smile  
And when I'm gone for awhile  
I'll once more want to meet you  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
Just south of man's delight  
Close to a soft flowing stream  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
We will join as lovers might  
Between the lines of a dream  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
Just south of man's delight  
Close to a soft flowing stream  
  
In the Grove of Eglantine  
We will join as lovers might  
Between the lines of a dream  
  
In Eglantine of a dream

In the abyss of space  
From the center of time  
A superman race  
Moves the Serpent to climb  
  
The journey has lasted  
Seven ages or more  
Life after life  
Must pass through the door  
  
The secret revealed  
When you leave your cave  
Is a glory of thunder  
And life from the grave  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The people have massed  
In the center of town  
We drink from a glass  
And the world turns around  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind  
  
The Serpent is rising  
Uncoiling in your spine  
Bringing you light  
From the depths of your mind

I hear voices from beyond the veil  
They reverberate in mystery  
There are shadows in my heart  
And they multiply in memory  
  
And the comrades that I've lost out there  
In the scattered ruins still speak to me  
  
If the flickering light of your campfire dims  
The world grows smaller  
It's closing in  
I'm standing here  
And I want you to live  
  
I know  
  
These are the times we find out who we really are  
This will be when a true friend stands at your side  
Someone like me who wants to  
Believe in the days of high times and innocence  
Drawing the lines and shouting back to the night  
Someone like me who wants you to live  
  
And from those who've seen the light beyond  
We know the end will bring tranquility  
But the voices of the friends they heard  
Brought them back to this reality  
  
Tough the beacon of light in your life seems dim  
The sun's coming up on the world we're in  
There are choices here  
And I want you to live  
  
I know  
  
These are the times we find out who we really are  
This will be when a true friend stands at your side  
One more like me  
Who wants to believe in the truth of all we experienced  
To live again to jump back into the fight  
Someone like me who wants you to live  
  
Pouring light from the sky  
Portends you and I  
Disappears in the night  
  
I still remember  
  
I hear voices from beyond the veil  
Like a faint unfinished symphony  
  
Though the beacon of light in your life seems dim  
The sun's coming up on the world we're in  
I'm standing here  
And I want you to live  
  
I know  
  
These are the times we find out who we really are  
This will be when a true friend stands at your side  
One more like me  
Who wants to believe in the truth of all we experienced  
To live again to jump back into the fight  
Someone like me who wants you to live  
  
I want you, I want you, I want you to live  
I want you, I want you, I want you to live  
I want you to live  
  
I still remember.

This Old Man  
He worked for thirty years with  
Two strong hands, in the factory light his  
Lunch box held all his needs with  
Coffee sandwiches and dreams  
For Me  
  
This Old Man  
He taught me many times  
To undertand, that showing love is simply  
Nothing you should have o hide  
Don't keep your feelings locked inside  
He said  
  
When I was young  
I dreamed a young man's dreams  
I saw in you reyes  
The things I'd never seen  
But now I grow old  
But I don't really mind  
Cause can't you see with my family  
We'll share these timeless memories

Rush down, down to the first floor  
There never seems to be enough time  
Push hard, and push a little bit more  
A cup of coffee and I'm gonna be fine  
Fine as I can be now  
  
Me and you, we do what we gotta do  
We only want to have a good life  
It's tough, we don't see each other enough  
And sometime the going gets rough  
Still we keep pushing on through  
  
We could use another summer of love  
It's cloudy here  
But there's a blue sky up above  
  
If we could only fly away from here  
We could say good-bye to all the tears  
And maybe we could spend the rest of our years  
Together, together  
  
Sometimes I watch the TV news  
I wanna say what's the use in trying  
Cause come on, what kind of difference can one man make  
Yeah but how much more can I take  
  
I think back when I was a little kid  
I did what little kids did  
Played war 'til I didn't wanna play no more  
Hey and that's when love stepped in  
Changed everything again  
  
It's never too late for a summer of love  
Yeah it's cloudy here  
But there's a blue sky up above  
  
If we could only fly away from here  
We could say good-bye to all the tears  
And maybe we could spend the rest of our years  
Together, we could be together  
  
These are crazy times  
It's a different world  
Well, that's okay  
Let it be that way  
We could lose our minds  
Or we could find our way  
We can change our world  
No matter what they say  
  
If we could only fly away from here  
We could turn around and say good-bye to all the tears  
And maybe we could spend the rest of our years  
Together  
We could be together  
  
Now, we can let the sunshine in (Together)  
And we can overcome and win (Together)  
We'll have ourselves a summer of love again (Together)  
We'll be, we'll be together  
Hey, hey  
We'll be together

Yeah, here I am sitting on this bar stool,  
Talking like a damn fool  
Got the twelve o'clock news blues  
And I've given up hope for the afternoon soaps  
And a bottle of cold brew  
Is it any wonder I'm not crazy  
Is it any wonder I'm sane at all  
  
Well I'm so tired of losing  
I've got nothing to do and all day to do it  
Well I'd go out cruising, but I've no place  
To go and all night to get there  
Is it any wonder I'm not a criminal  
Is it any wonder I'm not in jail  
  
Is it any wonder I've got too much time on my hands  
It's ticking away with my sanity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
It's hard to believe such a calamity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me  
  
(Too much time on my hands)  
It's tick tick tick tick ticking away  
(Too much time on my hands)  
And I don't know what to do with myself  
(Too much time on my hands)  
  
(Too much time on my hands)  
(Too much time on my hands)  
(Too much time on my hands)  
  
Now I'm a jet fuel genius  
I can solve the world's problems  
Without even trying  
I've got dozens of friends, and the fun never ends  
That is as long as I'm buying  
Is it any wonder I'm not the President  
Is it any wonder I'm null and void  
  
Is it any wonder I've got too much  
Time on my hands  
It's ticking away with my sanity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
It's hard to believe such a calamity  
I've got too much time on my hands  
And it's ticking away, ticking away from me  
  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Ticky tick tick tick tick ticking away  
(Too much time on my hands)  
And I don't know what to do with myself  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Umm mmm  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Tick tick tick ticking away  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Umm mmm  
(Too much time on my hands)  
Too much time on my hands  
Too much time on my

Where am I going  
How do I get there  
What should I bring along  
Are people kind there  
Is peace of mind there  
Will I finally belong  
  
Cause you know ships sail their courses  
And heroes ride horses  
They know where they belong  
But I travel in circles  
Quickly to nowhere  
Singing my unfinished song  
  
Some poets say that  
There'll come a day that  
I'll find a place for me  
Why aren't I there yet  
Why can't I share yet  
Why can't my heart be free  
  
Cause you know ships sail their courses  
And heroes ride horses  
They know where they belong  
But I travel in circles  
Quickly to nowhere  
Singing my unfinished song

Looking up from where I stand  
I see the vapor trail  
Of a jet plane in the sky  
  
Here the wheel is in my hand  
But there's no wind in my sails  
And life is drifting by  
  
Still I hold on and wait  
I know it's not too late  
And my breeze will come  
  
Muse you satisfy my soul  
Keep me warm while the  
Cold world guards the gate  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Your love has kept my dream alive  
A vision of my life  
With you here by my side  
  
Every forward step I take  
Every moment I'm awake  
I feel your love inside  
  
So close I feel it in my bones  
I know I'm not alone as I climb this wall  
But I, sometimes I get so high  
I just want to live, love  
And taste it all  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
Here tonight  
I lie awake and watch you dream  
Under the light of the moon  
I wonder just how far we've been  
And where we'll be  
When the sun comes up  
Will this be our date with destiny  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
I'm searching  
I'm wondering  
I'm yearning  
Waiting for our time to come  
  
And I'm waiting

Look at all the people  
Looking at their dreams  
Smiles upon their faces  
Tell me what they see  
  
Look at all the people  
Have they gone astray?  
Living for tomorrow  
With dreams of yesterday  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal?  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure?  
  
What has come between us  
What has made us sad  
Childhood's forgotten  
Yet it's hiding in the past  
  
What has come between us  
There's something in ourselves  
Lines upon our faces  
Saying no more time for rest  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal?  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure?  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal?  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure?  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure?  
  
Lovely lady  
Tell me what you feel  
As a child were you mild  
Does it make it so unreal?  
  
Lovely lady  
Feel so insecure  
When you give all yourself  
How can you be sure?

How can I sleep tonight?  
When I know that tomorrow I'll be miles away,  
And how can I leave if I know when I kiss you goodbye,  
Baby you'll cry  
  
Where do I find the words?  
To convince you that there's a secret part of me,  
That dies every time I must pack up and walk out the door,  
When I'm wanting you more  
  
So while there's still time,  
Know that I love you,  
Baby please hold me tight,  
Girl while there's still time  
  
If I could stop the dawn,  
Make the moon and the stars shine on forever more,  
And never again have to say how much I'm missing you,  
But what can I do?  
  
So while there's still time,  
Say that you love me,  
Baby please hold me tight,  
Girl while there's still time  
  
If I should go, if I should go,  
There's a chance I could lose,  
The love of my life, the love of my life,  
Baby please don't make me choose  
  
Believe me  
Trust me  
Let me inside  
  
And while there's still time,  
Forget about tomorrow,  
Baby please let's not fight,  
Not while there's still time  
While there's still time  
While there's still time  
While there's still time  
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh

I guess we used to be the lucky ones  
Good fortune smiled on everyone  
Stop  
A voice said you best beware  
Stop  
Bad luck is everywhere  
And sure enough the voice was right  
My luck changed overnight  
Stop  
Please tell me what went wrong  
Stop  
I can't take these ups and downs  
  
Hard times come, hard times go  
And in between you hope and pray  
The scars don't show  
'Cause life is strange and so unsure  
The days you hardly make it through  
You swear that there's a curse on you  
'Cause nothing seems to fit  
And things won't go your way  
You know you've had enough  
You've got the right to say  
Why me, why me  
  
Rubelator  
  
Stop  
Here comes anxiety  
Stop  
Won't you please let me be, I need relief  
Hard times come, hard times go  
In between you hope and pray  
The scars don't show  
'Cause life is strange and so unsure  
The days you hardly make it through  
You're sure that there is a curse on you  
If nothing seems to fit  
And things won't go your way  
You know you've had enough  
You can't take another day  
Where to go and what to do  
You've got those bills to pay  
You're really not alone you know  
'Cause everybody says,  
Why me  
  
Why me  
"Why me? That's what I want to know. You know what I mean? Huh. I don't know."

So they say that a man can't live in this world  
If he's wearing his heart on his sleeve  
I can  
  
And they say that a man can't understand  
What a women needs when she cries  
I can  
I can  
  
And I can see you standing in the yard  
Tending the roses in your garden  
The sun is shining through your cotton dress  
And I will freeze this moment here in time  
I could live forever in your garden  
Ah yes  
Yes I can  
  
Fool doesn't know what he's missing the most  
It's a bitch of a place to be in  
Here I am  
  
How would I know I could give up the ghost  
And still hold all your dreams in my hand  
Here I am  
Here I am  
  
And I can see you standing in the yard  
Tending the roses in your garden  
The wind is blowing through your golden hair  
And I will freeze this moment here in time  
I could live forever in your garden  
Ah yes  
Yes I can  
  
And I can see you standing in the yard  
Tending the roses in your garden  
The sun is shining through your cotton dress  
And I will freeze this moment here in time  
I could live forever in your garden  
Oh yes  
Yes I can  
  
And I can be your man  
Mmm, yes I can

I met a little girl sitting in the front  
Pardon me miss for seeming quite so blunt  
But your beauty and your presence  
Just took me by surprise  
  
She said there's a meaning in my sexy stare  
But that's my old man that's sitting over there  
And that's not the look of love that he's got for you in his eyes  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
I took her home and we was doing nip and tuck  
How was I to know that I was out of luck  
And before I knew it, the devil took my soul  
  
In two weeks time it seemed to be the steady con  
She told me "you're about to be a papa, John"  
And I just looked around and tried to crawl into the nearest hole  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
Well, in two more weeks I started feeling sore  
I found myself waiting at my doctor's door  
He said, "son I'm sorry but I've got some slightly less than tragic news  
  
"yeah, it seems you've been sociable with certain she's  
Cause you've contracted what we call a social disease  
And next time you better ask and use it, no don't refuse"  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask  
  
You know what you've gotta do  
There's no one else to blame but you  
Nobody's gonna tell you so next time you just had better ask

Welcome my friends  
To a place that may seem  
Most disturbing  
Quite unnerving  
  
Lend me your dreams  
And we'll add what we need  
To be free  
Terminally  
  
We'll fly to a spot  
Where I know there is not  
Any sorrow  
No tomorrow  
  
People just laugh  
Cause they know how it feels  
To have loved  
And be loved  
  
Don't you worry  
Ain't no need to hurry  
All you really need  
Is love  
  
Bah bah bah bah bah  
  
Now you may say  
Tell me more of this place  
So inviting  
And exciting  
  
Here and above  
Children love without doubt  
And can be  
They can be  
  
Listen my friends  
Carefully to direction  
To get there  
And you know where  
  
Love is the place  
Skewed to matter and space  
For us all  
For us all  
  
Don't you worry  
Ain't no need to hurry  
All you really need  
Is love, love, love

people say with age there comes experience  
but as soon as you are born you start to die  
older men are chosen to speak wisely  
but call the child to the sacrificial right  
  
who can we get to win the fight?  
young man!  
who can we get to make love all night?  
young man!  
who do we send away to die?  
young man!  
I heard a lonely woman cry for a  
young man!  
  
the fire bombs in distant lands are burning  
jarring every synapse in your soul  
life and death are a meaningless profession  
tomorrow brings a horror yet untold  
  
who can we get to win the fight?  
young man!  
who can we get to make love all night?  
young man!  
who do we send away to die?  
young man!  
I heard a lonely woman cry for a  
young man!  
  
young man!  
young man!  
  
come home my son  
we'll give you a rest  
welcome my son  
we'll give you the best  
time's stowaway  
the young man  
short are the days  
of the young man  
  
young man!  
young man!
