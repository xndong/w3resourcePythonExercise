The winter's bitterness is lost  
It's the fireside warmth that comforts me  
The peace for all my thoughts  
  
The night brings shadows to the street  
It's the time for dreams of things to come  
To creep inside their lives  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, deep inside you  
Let me touch you, let me keep you  
Let me know you're there  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, no  
Yes deep inside you're a part of me  
Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there  
  
The evening fantasy begins  
In the sandy lanes that cross the fields  
The gentle rain will fall  
  
The morning sweeps away the night  
And the dreams of you still haunt my thoughts  
Bring meaning to my life  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, deep inside you  
Let me touch you, let me keep you  
Let me know you're there  
  
You're concealing every feeling  
Can you find me, no  
Yes deep inside you're a part of me  
Every day I need to know I'm there, I'm there, I'm there  
  
Can you hold me with your small hand  
Prepare much, length and beauty of our tiny lives  
Future's brighter now  
Our world is everything to me, to know, I'm there  
Lord! You see the world is brighter than the sky  
The sky is shining everywhere in our world  
You know you never said in your many times, all in me instead

Look up on the wall, there on the floor,  
Under the pillow, behind the door.  
There's a crack in the mirror.  
Somewhere there's a hole in a window pane.  
Do you think I'm to blame?  
Tell me, do you think I'm to blame?  
  
(When we do it) you're never there.  
(When you show it) just stop and stare.  
(Abacab) he's in anywhere.  
(Abacab)  
  
If you're wrappin' up the world  
'Cause you've taken someone else's girl,  
When they turn on the pillow,  
Even when they answer the telephone,  
Don't you think that by now...  
Tell me, don't you think that by now.  
  
(When we do it) you're never there.  
(When you show it) just stop and stare.  
(Abacab) he's in anywhere.  
(Abacab) doesn't really care.  
  
Do you want it? You got it. Now you know.  
Do you want it? You got it. Now you know.  
  
It's an illusion. It's a game,  
Or reflection of someone else's name.  
When you wake in the morning,  
Wake and find you're covered in cellophane,  
Well, there's a hole in there somewhere.  
Yeah, there's a hole in there somewhere.  
Baby, there's a hole in there somewhere.  
Now there's a hole in there somewhere.  
  
(When we do it) you're never there.  
(When you show it) you stop and stare.  
(Abacab) he's in anywhere.  
(Abacab)

Like the dust that settles all around me,  
I must find a new home.  
The ways and holes that used to give me shelter,  
Are all as one to me now.  
But I, I would search everywhere  
Just to hear your call,  
And walk upon stranger roads than this one  
In a world I used to know before.  
I miss you more.  
  
Than the sun reflecting off my pillow,  
Bringing the warmth of new life.  
And the sounds that echoed all around me,  
I caught a glimpse of in the night.  
But now, now I've lost everything,  
I give to you my soul.  
The meaning of all that I believed before  
Escapes me in this world of none, no thing, no one.  
  
And I would search everywhere  
Just to hear your call,  
And walk upon stranger roads than this one  
In a world I used to know before.  
For now I've lost everything,  
I give to you my soul.  
The meaning of all that I believed before  
Escapes me in this world of none,  
I miss you more.

Woke up in the morning staggered out of bed  
Thought about getting back again, but went downstairs instead  
Read the daily paper have to know the truth  
Slammed the door as I ran outside, looked at my watch and cried  
Gotta get to work on time  
Gotta get to work on time  
  
Then the sky turned a deeper blue  
Not a cloud as the sun shone through  
But all around rain kept falling to the ground  
The wind was blowing but the trees didn't make a sound  
Just another alien afternoon  
Just another alien afternoon  
  
Time that I was leaving while there's still a chance  
Before I start believing in what I see or hear  
Nothing here to keep me, nothing anywhere  
Gotta get out pack my bags before I go insane  
Gotta get away in time  
Gotta get away in time  
  
Then the sky turned from blue to green  
Took on colors I have never seen  
Then a sound started ringing in my ears  
I heard voices but in truth there's nobody there  
Just another alien afternoon  
Just another alien afternoon  
  
To be there back where I belong  
To feel again the wind upon my face  
To see again all that I took for granted  
All that I left and everything I knew  
  
We are home  
We are your home  
We are all your home  
  
Not another alien afternoon  
  
Never more to go wandering  
Never leaving my world behind  
  
There was never a reason  
To leave my heart and my home behind  
Where I was born is where I should be now  
I would never be lonely  
I would never be sad again  
  
I wanted to go anywhere  
I wanted to see how strange it all could be  
Nothing would ever take me away again  
Never more to go wandering  
Never leaving my world behind  
No, no, no, no  
Nothing will ever take me away again, away again  
No, no, no, no

LOVING COUPLE:  
I can't see you but I know you're there.  
Got to get beside you 'cause it's really cold out here.  
Come up close to me you'll soon be warm.  
Hold me tightly like we're sheltering from a storm.  
  
MOUSE:  
Think I might go out for a stroll  
Into the night, and out of this hole.  
Maybe find me a meal.  
Walking along this new shag pile  
Presents a problem all the while.  
Nearly the door.  
  
Suddenly he bumps into wood, the door is closed.  
A voice from the bed, he'll be exposed.  
Which way to run, must make for the hole,  
But the light's been turned on, now he's blind as a mole in coal.  
  
Now I can see they're coming at me,  
They've blocked off my door, I haven't a chance in hell.  
  
COUPLE:  
Come on baby let the poor thing go.  
I'm not sleeping with that thing around here, no.  
Alright then, I'll fetch a box from below,  
Guard him carefully, they're very quick you know.  
  
MOUSE:  
The door's been opened, my chance to escape.  
Must run out quick, better sorry than late.  
I'm out on the stairs.  
They won't catch me now, I've the run of the house now.  
I'll make it downstairs and into the bread bin.  
That would be nice.  
  
Suddenly he bumps into fur, that's very unwise,  
A cat is much quicker than men and their eyes.  
The chase that ensues can have only one end,  
Unless outside help steps in for our friend in need.  
  
But now the cat comes in for the kill,  
His paw is raised, soon blood will spill, yes it will.  
  
CAT:  
Hard luck mouse, this is the end of your road.  
The signpost says inside me, let me bear your heavy load.  
But it's not to be, that final pounce  
Knocks a jar upon his head, and lays him out.  
  
But it's all in a mouse's night  
To take on all those who would fight.  
  
CAT'S STORY:  
There I was with my back to the wall,  
Then comes this monster mouse, he's ten feet tall,  
With teeth and claws to match.  
It only took one blow.

Am I very wrong  
To hide behind the glare of an open minded stare  
Am I very wrong  
To wander in the fear of a never ending lie  
Am I very wrong  
To try to close my ears to the sound they play so loud  
Am I very wrong  
The happiness machine is trying hard to sing my song  
Today's your birthday friend  
Everything all right  
Let us our greetings to you send  
Happy friend  
Everything all right  
We hope your life will never end  
Am I very wrong  
To want to steal a pin then I'll check that I have skin  
Am I very wrong  
To want to leave my friends and the curse of the happiness machine  
Today's your birthday friend  
Everything all right  
Let us our greetings to you send  
Happy friend  
Everything all right  
We hope your life will never end  
We hope your life will never end  
They say ...  

It's funny you know,  
Cause there's an old rock 'n' roller  
He's got nowhere to go.  
Did you ever think of taking him in?  
Somebody help him, somebody please.  
  
Put another record on  
Cause he likes that song.  
  
It's funny you know,  
Ooh he never done nothing, done nobody wrong,  
Did he think about changing his name,  
But I'm gonna tell him it's the same old game.  
  
Put another record on  
Round and round and round and around - oh  
Ah - see him smile.  
  
Well lately I've seen him  
Walking down the street, kinda moving his feet,  
Everyone I know looks the other way  
Somebody help him, somebody say -  
  
Put another record on  
Round and round and round and around - oh  
Ah - see him smile.  
  
It's funny you know,  
Cause there's an old rock 'n' roller  
He's got nowhere to go.  
Did you ever think of taking him in?  
Somebody help him, somebody please.  
  
Just put another record on

No-one seems to take up the chase, and with the familiar faces fresh in his
mind he moves into a reconstruction of his old life, above ground - Too much
time was one thing he didn't need, so he used to cut through it with a little
speed. He was better off dead, than slow in the head. His momma and poppa had
taken a ride on his back, so he left very quickly to join The Pack.  
  
I see faces and traces of home back in New York City -  
So you think I'm a tough kid? Is that what you heard?  
Well I like to see some action and it gets into my blood.  
The call me the trail blazer - Rael - electric razor  
I'm the pitcher in the chain gang, we don't believe in pain  
'Cause we're only as strong, yes we're only as strong,  
As the weakest link in the chain.  
  
Only after a spell in Pontiac reformatory was he given any respect in the
gang.  
  
Let me out of Pontiac when I was just seventeen,  
I had to get it out of me, if you know what I mean, what I mean.  
  
You say I must be crazy, 'cause I don't care who I hit, who I hit.  
But I know it's me that's hitting out and I'm, I'm not full of shit.  
I don't care who I hurt, I don't care who I do wrong.  
This is your mess I'm stuck in, I really don't belong.  
When I take out my bottle, filled up high with gasoline,  
You can tell by the night fires where Rael has been, has been.  
  
Now, walking back home after a raid, he was cuddling a sleeping porcupine.  
That night he pictured the removal of his hairy heart and to the accompaniment
of very romantic music he watched it being shaved smooth by an anonymous
stainless steel razor.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair,  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!  
Off we go...  
  
Your sitting in your comfort you don't believe I'm real,  
You cannot buy protection from the way that I feel.  
Your progressive hypocrites hand out their trash,  
But it was mine in the first place, so I'll burn it to ash.  
And I've tasted all the strongest meats,  
And laid them down in coloured sheets (laid them down in coloured  
Sheets).  
Who needs illusion of love and affection  
When you're out walking the streets with your mainline connection?  
Connection.  
  
As I cuddled the porcupine  
He said I had none to blame, but me.  
Held my heart, deep in hair.  
Time to shave, shave it off, it off.  
No time for romantic escape,  
When your fluffy heart is ready for rape. No!

Big Jim Cooley commanded respect  
Whatever he wanted he could get  
The badge on his waistcoat shone in the sun  
It ain't no lie, Big Jim was feared by everyone  
  
In the saloon one evening Big took a bet  
With a rancher whose name I forget  
He wanted a herd taken over the plain  
And he called Jim "yellow", he'll never do that again  
  
He got mad!  
He threw his badge on the floor and walked out  
He's gonna give it a try, he left no doubt  
  
"Must be mad, must be mad"!  
The people wished him well, and good luck  
"Hell, I don't need it"! He laughed , got on  
His horse and rode away  
  
Over on the trail, Jim 'n' his crew of five  
Were trying their best to keep the cattle alive  
The weather was hard, but so were the men  
Though I don't think even Jim'll try this trip again  
  
His horses were edgy, sensing trouble ahead  
But the trouble didn't start till the men were in bed  
A-whooping and a-hollering and flashing their knives  
Big and his men were jumped by an all-star Indian tribe  
  
  
He was scared, Big Jim was scared  
Alive, they called him lucky, but not today  
Cos he died like all good cowboys with his boots on next to his men  
  
Big Jim, he still won't lie down  
For him the bet is still on  
Some say he rides there, cursing still  
Some say they've seen him

I held the book so tightly in my hands,  
I saw your picture, heard you call my name  
There was something strange, I could not look away  
I wanted to be there, I wanted to go  
  
You gave me no warning  
You gave no reason  
But I was with you  
Right by your side  
Just give me the strength, and I will help you  
And they can try their hardest, 'cause they don't frighten me  
  
It is written in the book  
  
It is hotter than I've known before, but I feel so cold, and I don't  
know why  
But if the fire within your heart can beat the storm  
Then I really believe, you could make it right  
  
Ooh the time has come now  
We must show our feelings  
But I'm looking right through you  
And your heart is empty  
  
Whatever happened to you it's too late to change now  
There's nowhere you can run to, no place to hide  
Ah you let me down!  
  
But wait a minute, I don't understand  
It's getting stronger, so grab my hand  
Don't want to leave you, don't want to go  
But I'm losing all control  
Can't you see me? I'm slipping away  
I can only stay if you've the will to keep me here  
  
It is written in the book  
  
Oh so many times since I've read those words  
Just waiting to see you, can you see me?

Dark and grey, an English film, the Wednesday play  
We always watch the Queen on Christmas Day  
Won't you stay?  
  
Though your eyes see shipwrecked sailors you're still dry  
The outlook's fine though Wales might have some rain  
Saved again.  
  
Let's skip the news boy (I'll go and make some tea)  
Arabs and Jews boy (too much for me)  
They get me confused boy (puts me off to sleep)  
And the thing I hate, oh Lord!  
Is staying up late, to watch some debate, on some nation's fate.  
  
Hypnotized by Batman, Tarzan, still surprised!  
You've won the West in time to be our guest  
Name your prize!  
  
Drop of wine, a glass of beer dear what's the time?  
The grime on the Tyne is mine all mine all mine  
Five past nine.  
  
Blood on the rooftops, Venice in the spring  
The Streets of San Francisco, a word from Peking  
The trouble was started, by a young Errol Flynn  
Better in my day, oh Lord!  
For when we got bored, we'd have a world war, happy but poor  
So let's skip the news boy (I'll go and make some tea)  
Blood on the rooftops (too much for me)  
When old Mother Goose stops, and they're out for twenty three  
Then the rain at Lords stopped play  
Seems Helen of Troy has found a new face again.

The warming sun, the cooling rain  
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze  
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you  
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through  
The words of love, the cries of hate  
And the man in the moon who seduced you  
Then finally loosed you  
  
You climbed upon a burning rope to escape the mob below  
But you had put the flaming out so that others could now follow  
To be out of the bounds and the barks of those who do not wish you well  
  
You must blaze a trail of your own, unknown, alone  
But keep in mind  
Don't live today for tomorrow like you were immortal  
The only survivors on this world of ours are  
  
The warming sun, the cooling rain  
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze  
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you  
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through  
The words of love, the cries of hate  
And the man in the moon who seduced you  
Then finally loosed you  
  
You're old and disillusioned now as you realise at last  
That all you have accomplished here will have soon all turned to dust  
You dream of a future after life, well that's as maybe, I don't know  
  
But you can't take what you left behind, you're all alone  
So keep in mind  
Don't live today for tomorrow like you were immortal  
The only survivors on this world of ours are  
  
The warming sun, the cooling rain  
The snowflake drifting on the breath of the breeze  
The lightning bolt that clears the sky for you  
Yet only eagles seem to pass on through  
The words of love, the cries of hate  
And the man in the moon who seduced you  
Then finally loosed you

Calling all stations  
Can anybody tell me, tell me exactly where I am  
I've lost all sense of direction  
Watching the darkness closing around me  
Feeling the cold all through my body  
That's why I'm calling all stations  
In the hope that someone hears me  
A single lonely voice  
  
I feel the sensation disappearing  
There's a tingling in my arms  
And there's a numbness in my hands  
  
All the broken promises  
All my good intentions don't add up to very much  
And I realize whatever happened, whatever happened  
I remember all the moments that I've wasted in my life  
All the things I was always gonna do  
Why is it now when it's too late  
That I've finally realized it's important to me  
To think that everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And it's tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
  
Calling all stations  
Can anybody tell me, tell me exactly where I am  
How different things look when your all on your own  
Watching the darkness closing all around me  
All around me  
And I'm lost with feeling  
Of your arms to remind me  
Of everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And it's tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
Don't you know there's never been a moment  
When I haven't had the thought  
That everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart  
Could so easily be taken  
And it's tearing me apart  
Going over and over in my mind  
I relive it one second at a time  
As I sit here in the darkness  
Feeling so alone  
And everything that's dear to me  
And is always in my heart

The scattered pages of a book by the sea  
Held by the sand, washed by the waves  
A shadow forms cast by a cloud,  
Skimming by as eyes of the past, but the rising tide  
Absorbs them effortlessly claiming.  
  
They told of one who tired of all singing,  
"Praise him, praise him."  
"We heed not flatterers," he cried,  
"By our command, waters retreat,  
Show my power, halt at my feet,"  
But the cause was lost,  
Now cold winds blow.  
  
For from the north overcast ranks advance  
Fear of the storm accusing with rage and scorn.  
The waves surround the sinking throne  
Singing "Crown him, crown him,"  
"Those who love our majesty show themselves!"  
All bent their knees.  
  
But he forced a smile even though  
His hopes lay dashed where offerings fell (where they fell).  
"Nothing can my peace destroy as long as none smile."  
More opened ears and opened eyes,  
And soon they dared to laugh.  
See a little man with his face turning red  
Though his story's often told you can tell he's dead.

You say that I put chains on you  
But I don't think that's really true  
But if you want to be free from me  
You gotta lose me in another world  
  
Send me to the Congo I'm free to leave  
There's always somewhere anybody can lead  
Send me to the Congo you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
Like a soldier ant  
I will wait for the signal to act  
To take a walk right through the door  
If you don't want me here any more  
  
Send me to the Congo I'm free to leave  
There's always somewhere anybody can lead  
Send me to the Congo you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
Into my heart you came  
And gave a whole new meaning to my life  
Into my world you brought a light  
I thought it never would go out  
  
Send me to the Congo I'm free to leave  
There's always somewhere anybody can lead  
Send me to the Congo you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
You can send me to the Congo I'm free to leave  
There's always somewhere anybody can lead  
Yes you can send me to the Congo, you have to believe  
You can do it if you want to just do what you please  
  
I would never be the one to say you had no reason  
To want me somewhere else far far away  
But someday you may understand, someday you will see  
That someone who would die for you is all I've ever been  
  
Congo the Congo, if that's how it's got to be  
Congo the Congo, if that's what you want from me  
  
I would never be the one to say you had no reason  
To want me somewhere else far far away  
Someday you may understand someday you will see...

The palpitating cherry-red organ was returned to its rightful place and began
to beat faster as it led our hero, counting out time, through his first
romantic encounter.  
  
I'm counting out time,  
Got the whole thing down by numbers.  
All those numbers!  
Give me guidance!  
O Lord I need that now.  
  
The day of judgement's come,  
And you can bet that I've been resting,  
for this testing,  
Digesting every word the experts say.  
Erogenous zones I love you.  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
  
Found a girl I wanted to date,  
Thought I'd better get it straight.  
Went to buy a book before it's too late.  
Don't leave nothing to fate.  
I studied every line, every page in the book,  
Now, I've got the real thing here, I'm gonna take a look, take a look.  
  
This is Rael!  
  
I'm counting out time, hoping it goes like I planned it,  
'cause I understand it. Look! I've found the hotspots, Figs 1-9.  
Still counting out time, got my finger on the button,  
"Don't say nuttin' just lie there still  
And I'll get you turned on just fine."  
Erogenous zones I love you.  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
  
Touch and go with 1-6.  
Bit of trouble in zone No. 7.  
Gotta remember all of my tricks.  
There's heaven ahead in No. 11!  
Getting crucial responses, dilation of the pupils.  
"Honey get hip! It's time to unzip, to unzip, zip, zip-a-zip-a-zip.  
Whipee!"  
(Take it away Mr. Guitar)  
  
I'm counting out time, reaction none to happy,  
Please don't slap me,  
I'm a red blooded male and the book said I could not fail.  
I'm counting out time, I got unexpected distress from my mistress,  
I'll get my money back from the bookstore right away.  
Erongenous zones I question you  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
Without you, what would a poor boy do?  
Without you, mankind handkinds through' the blues.

Wake up now, this is the time you've waited for  
  
Far below, where shadows fester as they grow  
An army thousands strong, obsessed by right and wrong  
Sense their time is coming near  
So they turn towards the light from their region of the night  
Marching on and on  
They near the air, it won't be long  
  
You know you're on the way out  
It's just a matter of time  
You thought you'd rule the world forever  
Long live the king, don't spare the loser  
  
After all, you're not what you thought you were at all  
You're just a natural fact, another cul de sac  
On nature's hard unfeeling trail  
And all those dreams of old will be stories left untold  
Cut off in your prime, extinct until the end of time  
  
Now the host emerges, a shadow starts to fall  
Not one knows what hit them, none can see at all  
Even as the end approaches still they're not aware  
How can you fight a foe so deadly  
When you don't even know it's there  
And now that the job is almost done  
Maybe some escape, no, not even one

Holy Mother of God  
You've got to go faster than that to get to the top.  
Dirty old mountain  
All covered in smoke, she can turn you to stone  
So you better start doing it right  
Better start doing it right.  
  
You're halfway up and you're halfway down  
And the pack on your back is turning you around.  
Throw it away, you won't need it up there, and remember  
You don't look back whatever you do.  
Better start doing it right.  
  
On your left and on your right  
Crosses are green and crosses are blue  
Your friends didn't make it through.  
Out of the night and out of the dark  
Into the fire and into the fight  
Well that's the way the heroes go, Ho! Ho! Ho!  
  
Through a crack in Mother Earth,  
Blazing hot, the molten rock  
Spills out over the land.  
And the lava's the lover who licks your boots away. Hey! Hey! Hey!  
If you don't want to boil as well.  
Be-be-better start the dance  
D-D-Do you want to dance with me.  
  
The music's playing, the notes are right  
Put your left foot first and move into the light.  
The edge of this hill is the edge of the world  
And if you're going to cross you better start doing it right  
Better start doing it right.  
  
Let the dance begin.

The grey of evening fills the room,  
No need to look outside,  
To see or feel the rain.  
I reach across to touch her,  
But I know that she's not there.  
Rain keeps running down the window pane.  
Time is running out for me.  
  
Can't you see what you are doing to me?  
Can't you see what you have done?  
As I try to pass another long and sleepless night,  
A hundred crazy voices call my name,  
As I try to pass them by,  
I almost can believe that she is here,  
In the glow of the night.  
  
Do you know what you have done?  
Do you know what you've begun?  
Do you see we shall never be together again?  
All of my life.  
  
Lonely people, empty rooms,  
Pointless violence, silent tombs.  
Could it be that we shall be together again?  
  
Sheets of double glazing help to keep outside the night,  
Only foreign city sirens can cut through,  
Nylon sheets and blankets help to minimize the cold.  
But they can't keep out the chilling sounds.  
Will the nightmare soon give way to dreaming  
That she is here with me?  
In the glow of the night.  
  
Do you know what you have done?  
Do you know what you've begun?  
Do you see we shall never be together again?  
Lonely people, empty rooms,  
Pointless violence, silent tombs.  
Could it be that we shall be together again?  
  
In silence and darkness  
We held each other near that night  
We prayed it would last forever.  
  
Blood on the windows  
Millions of ordinary people are there  
They gaze at the scenery  
They act as if it is perfectly clear  
Take a look at the mountains  
Take a look at the beautiful river of blood.  
  
The liquid surrounds me  
I fight to rise from this river of hell  
I stare round about me  
Children are swimming and playing with boats  
Their features are changing  
Their bodies dissolve and I am alone.  
  
Now see what you've gone and done.  
  
Now you never did see such a terrible thing  
As was seen last night on T.V.  
Maybe if we're lucky, they will show it again  
Such a terrible thing to see  
There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line  
You've got to go domino.  
  
Now I'm one with the living and I'm feeling just fine  
I know what I must do  
Play the game of happiness and never let on  
That it only lives on in a song  
There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line  
You've got to go domino.  
  
Do you know what you have done?  
Do you know what you've begun?  
  
In silence and darkness  
Hold each other near tonight  
For will it last forever?  
  
There's nothing you can do when you're the next in line  
You've got to go domino.

It's good to be here! How've you been?  
Check my bags, boy! Where's my room?  
I sit on the phone, that's my game,  
Keep up the pressure all the way!  
  
I don't want to beat about the bush  
But none of us are getting any younger.  
There's people out there who could take your place.  
A more commercial view! A fresher face!  
  
I need a shower, take a nap  
I'll meet you in the bar, we must have a rap.  
There's a lot on the line, a lot to say.  
There's something I must tell you today.  
  
You and I both know the score,  
You can't go on like this forever.  
So it's with regret that I tell you now  
That from this moment on,  
You're on your own!  
  
I don't talk round corners, it's right between the eyes  
If you're slow they'll run past you,  
Stand tall, see them falling over.  
I walk a straight line, it's right between the eyes.  
Well show me the door, show me someone who'll do it better.  
  
The drinks are on me, be my guest.  
Smoke a cigar? Take the best.  
Don't hedge your bets, we can make a deal,  
You got it in your pocket, how do you feel?  
  
So glad that's over, now you know,  
But I'm only acting under orders.  
And looking down on you from way up here.  
You've got to sink or swim, get off the floor!  
  
I don't talk round corners, it's right between the eyes  
If you're slow they'll run past you,  
Stand tall, see them falling over,  
I walk a straight line, right between the eyes.  
Well show me the door, show me someone who'll do it better.

In and out of darkness, in and out of sleep  
Trying to keep my hands upon the wheel  
Never saw the corner in the driving rain  
I never saw her step into the street  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Memories to keep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
I can never understand what went through my mind  
I didn't stop to see what I had done  
I had to keep on driving deep into the night  
The miles between would somehow put it right  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Memories to keep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
All my life you lie silently there  
All my life in a world so unfair  
All my life and only I'll know why  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my life  
Trapped in her memory all my life  
Till the day that you open your eyes  
Please open your eyes  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
  
Heard it on the radio, saw it on TV  
But could I take my secret to the grave  
If I had another chance, would I do the same  
  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Dreaming while you sleep  
Are you dreaming while you sleep ?  
  
All my life I'll be haunted by  
All my life just one moment in time  
All my life until the day I die  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my life  
Trapped in her memory all my life  
Till the day that you open your eyes  
  
All of my life, you lie silently there  
All my life, in a world so unfair  
All my life, and only I know why  
And it will live inside of me  
I will never be free all my live  
Trapped in her memory, all my life  
Till the day that you open your eyes

Leaving my family behind me  
Not knowing what lay ahead  
Waving goodbye, as I left them in tears  
Remembering all we'd said  
  
I looked to the sky, I offered my prayers  
I asked Him for guidance and strength  
But the simple beliefs of a simple man  
Lay in His hands, and on my head  
My head  
  
I gave everything that they wanted  
But still they wanted more  
We sweat and we toiled  
Good men lost their lives  
I don't think they knew what for  
  
I sold them my heart  
I sold them my soul  
I gave everything I had  
But they couldn't break my spirit  
My dignity fought back  
Fightback  
Just fightback  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Don't you hear me  
Don't you see  
  
We worked in gangs for all we were worth  
The young boys pulling the wagons  
We were digging the tunnels, shifting the earth  
It was then that it happened  
  
No-one knew how the cracks appeared  
But as it fell they all disappeared  
Stone fell like rain  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Don't you hear me  
Can you breathe  
  
The smoke cleared, the dust it settled  
No one knew how many had died  
All around there were broken men  
They'd said it was safe, and they'd lied  
You could hear the cries, you could smell the fear  
But good fortune that day was mine  
And it occurred to me that the heart of a good man  
It seems is hard to find  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Don't you hear me  
Don't you see  
How we worked, how we worked like  
The devil for our pay  
Through the wind, through the snow  
And through the rain  
  
Blasting and cutting through Gods country like a knife  
Sweat stinging my eyes, there has to be a better life  
  
But I can hear my children's cry  
I can see the tears in their eyes  
Memories of those I've left behind  
Oh just still ringing in my ears  
Will I ever go back again  
Will I ever see her face again  
'cause I'll always remember that night  
As they waved goodbye to their fathers  
  
We came from the North  
And we came from the South  
With picks and with spades  
And a new kind of order  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead  
They'll never see the likes of us again  
  
Driving the last spike  
Lifting and laying the track  
With blistering hands  
And the sun burning your back  
  
But I can hear my children's cry  
I can see the tears in their eyes  
Oh memories of those I've left behind  
Still ringing in my ears  
'cause I'll always remember that night  
As they waved goodbye to their fathers  
  
We followed the rail, we slept under the stars  
Digging in darkness and living with danger  
Showing no fear of what lies up ahead  
They'll never see the likes of us again  
  
Can you hear me  
Can you see  
Don't you hear me  
Don't you see

Times were good,  
She never thought about the future, she just did what she would  
Oh but she really cared  
About her music, it all seemed so important then,  
  
And she dreamed that every time that she performed  
Everyone would cry for more,  
That all she had to do was step into the light,  
And everyone would start to roar.  
  
And on the road,  
Where all but a few fall by the wayside on the grassier verge,  
She battled through  
Against the others in her world, and the sleep, and the odds.  
  
But now every time that she performed  
Oh everybody cried for more,  
Soon all she had to do was step into the light,  
For everyone to start to roar.  
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.  
  
Oh but time went by  
It wasn't so easy now, all uphill, and not feeling so strong.  
Yes times were hard,  
Too much thinking 'bout the future and what people might want.  
  
An then there was the time that she performed  
When nobody called for more  
And soon every time she stepped into the light,  
They really let her know the score.  
But she dreamed of the times when she sang all her songs  
And everybody cried for more,  
When all she had to do was step into the light  
For everyone to start to roar.  
And all the people cried, you're the one we've waited for.

The sun had been up for a couple of hours,  
Covered the ground with a layer of gold.  
Spirits were high and the raining had stopped,  
The larder was low, But boy that wasn't all.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Couldn't get them very far.  
Daddy! Oh Daddy, You Promised.  
  
Out on the road in the direction of Perth,  
Backwards and forwards in a circle they went.  
Found a city half open and ready to greet,  
The conquering heros, with blisters on their feet.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Somehow got them all this far.  
Daddy! You Promised, You Promised.  
  
See the Stewart are dressed up  
He's got eyes in the back of his head.  
Who came in a cockleshell boat  
That could only just float,  
Couldn't even lift a sword.  
Dressed too fine and smelling of wine.  
  
Daddy you've got to go!  
Here come the bishop all dressed up  
He's gonna bless you if you're ready to pay  
One wave of his funny old stick,  
There's a band of light across your eyes.  
  
Waited a week still they hadn't appeared,  
That glorious timing that everyone feared.  
So they're riding along on the crest of a wave,  
They're headed for London, And that will be their grave  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Well he couldn't get them down that far  
Daddy! I'm waiting, I'm waiting  
  
Time to go to bed now  
Never seems too keen  
To be a guest now  
In a house of dreams  
  
Flying from a hillside  
Beckoning the trees  
A sailboat's awning  
Mimicking the breeze  
  
I'm fighting gravity falling  
My Daddy won't let them get me  
A voice screams seems to be calling  
The face turns features are burning.  
  
Daddy, you've got to go!  
See the fifteen going by,  
Tell the Lairds and the Lords  
They're running backwards today,  
And once again you stand alone.  
  
Bury your memories bury your friends,  
Leave it alone for a year or two.  
Till the stories go hazy and the legends come true,  
Then do it again. Some Things never end.  
Eleventh Earl of Mar  
Won't be going very far.  
You Promised, You Promised, You Promised.  
DADDY!

When you're asleep they may show you  
Aerial views of the ground,  
Freudian slumber empty of sound.  
  
Over the rooftops and houses,  
Lost as it tries to be seen,  
Fields of incentive covered with green.  
  
Mesmerized children are playing,  
Meant to be seen but not heard,  
"Stop me from dreaming!"  
"Don't be absurd!"  
  
"Well if we can help you we will,  
You're looking tired and ill.  
As I count backwards  
Your eyes become heavier still.  
Sleep, won't you allow yourself fall?  
Nothing can hurt you at all.  
With your consent  
I can experiment further still."  
  
Madrigal music is playing,  
Voices can faintly be heard,  
"Please leave this patient undisturbed."  
  
Sentenced to drift far away now,  
Nothing is quite what it seems,  
Sometimes entangled in your own dreams.  
  
"Well, if we can help you we will,  
Soon as you're tired and ill.  
With your consent  
We can experiment further still.  
  
Well, thanks to our kindness and skill  
You'll have no trouble until  
You catch your breath  
And the nurse will present you the bill!"

The girl from all those songs  
Who made everything feel right  
She came in like an angel, into your lonely life  
And filling your world with light  
Oh, and everybody told you "you're oh so lucky"  
  
Curtains part revealing a country scene  
Clothed in green and brown  
Evidence of autumn  
And recent rain  
On a winding lane, a byway  
Walking on that road is a certain girl  
In all the world the one  
Guaranteed to move you and turn your head  
When all's been said and done  
  
The girl from all those songs  
Who made everything feel right  
She came in like an angel, into your lonely life  
And filling your world with light  
Oh, and everybody told you "you're oh so lucky"  
  
The night is clear but cool  
Ooh maybe dawn is breaking as you turn to find her gone  
Then you see the note  
Ooh you cannot believe it  
And you think you'll go insane  
  
But that was many years ago  
And though the pain is dim  
A something still remains  
Though you hardly can recall  
Her face or form  
Her memory lingers on  
Ooh she made everything feel right  
She came in like an angel (in like an angel),  
Into your lonely life (into your life)  
And filling your world with light  
Oh and everybody told you "you're oh so lucky"

Another time it might have been so different  
If only we could do it all again  
But now it's just another fading memory  
Out of focus, though the outline still remains  
  
Far away, away, fading distant lights  
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world  
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember  
  
Like the story that we wish was never ending  
We know sometime we must reach the final page  
Still we carry on just pretending  
That there'll always be another day to go  
  
Far away, away, fading distant lights  
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world  
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember  
  
Another chance hello, another goodbye  
And so many things we'll never see again  
Days of life that seemed so unimportant  
Seem to matter and to count much later on  
  
Far away, away, fading distant lights  
Leaving us all behind, lost in a changing world  
And you know that these are the days of our lives remember

You are terrified by the smallest sound  
Because you live your life in such a sheltered world  
As do those who surround you  
Well I have seen you stung by poisonous flies  
And you suffer much too much from their bites  
There you sit in your comfort watching other people get caught by the  
Storm  
  
Many a thing that used to be a secret  
Has become so talked about  
Not worth a second thought  
There's different kinds of secrets now  
Times change, it's not enough to say  
It seemed a good idea a hundred years ago  
You think it's not your problem  
It really doesn't matter at all  
  
Every stone that's thrown must fall to the ground  
But you don't give a thought to where they might come down  
You are feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted  
  
Anywhere that they don't speak the same  
In any place that they don't think the same  
You think it's not your problem  
No no  
  
You think it's not your problem  
It really doesn't matter at all  
Oh...  
  
Maybe it's not your fate to be a leader of men  
But you just leave it all to someone else and complain  
You could be so much stronger, but it really doesn't matter any longer  
'Cause you're feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted  
'Cause you're feeding the fire over which you'll be roasted

As daybreak breaks the mist upon the earth  
It came to pass that beauty settled there forever more  
And as the steam clings close to things to come  
It came to pass that solid rock did part for humble life  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion  
Now there's hope reborn with every morning  
See the future clearly at its dawning  
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness  
As water slips into the sea  
The father's sad to see it free  
As shadows creep towards their master night  
It came to pass that trees defied the wind who shook their leaves  
And as the peace descended all around  
It came to pass that nature's creatures came to face the world  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion  
Now there's hope reborn with every morning  
See the future clearly at its dawning  
Forever drifting slowly towards a hazy emptiness  
As water slips into the sea  
The father's sad to see it free  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion  
Now there's hope reborn with every morning  
See the future clearly at its dawning  
Once upon a time there was confusion  
Disappointment, fear and disillusion  

The path is clear  
Though no eyes can see  
The course laid down long before.  
And so with gods and men  
The sheep remain inside their pen,  
Though many times they've seen the way to leave.  
  
He rides majestic  
Past hordes of men  
Who care not or gaze with joy,  
To see reflected there  
The trees, the sky, the lily fair,  
The scene of death is lying just below.  
  
The mountain cuts off the town from view,  
Like a cancer growth is removed by skill.  
Let it be revealed.  
A waterfall, his madrigal.  
An inland sea, his symphony.  
  
Undinal songs  
Urge the sailors on  
Till lured by sirens' cry.  
  
Now as the river dissolves in sea,  
So Neptune has claimed another soul.  
And so with gods and men  
The sheep remain inside their pen,  
Until the shepherd leads his flock away.  
  
The sands of time were eroded by  
The river of constant change.

Stay with me,  
My love I hope you'll always be  
Right here by my side if ever I needed you  
Oh my love  
  
In your arms,  
I feel so safe and so secure  
Everyday is such a perfect day to spend  
Alone with you  
  
I will follow you will you follow me  
All the days and nights that we know will be  
I will stay with you will you stay with me  
Just one single tear in each passing year  
  
With the dark,  
I see so very clearly now  
All my fears are drifting by me so slowly now  
Fading away  
  
I can say  
The night is long but you are there  
Close at hand I'm better for the smile you give  
And while I live  
  
I will follow you will you follow me  
All the days and nights that we know will be  
I will stay with you will you stay with me  
Just one single tear in each passing year there will be  
  
I will follow you, I will follow you

Sunday at six when they close both the gates  
A widowed pair,  
Still sitting there,  
Wonder if they're late for church  
And it's cold, so they fasten their coats  
And cross the grass, they're always last.  
  
Passing by the padlocked swings,  
The roundabout still turning,  
Ahead they see a small girl  
On her way home with a pram.  
  
Inside the archway,  
The priest greets them with a courteous nod.  
He's close to God.  
Looking back at days of four instead of two.  
Years seem so few (four instead of two).  
Heads bent in prayer  
For friends not there.  
  
Leaving twopence on the plate,  
They hurry down the path and through the gate  
And wait to board the bus  
That ambles down the street.

Happy the man - he lives a simple life  
He doesn?t have much - it doesn?t worry him  
Where you go - where?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere  
  
Like a nun with a gun - I?m wonderful fun  
Laughing all through - just watching you  
Seems a very stupid game...  
But I don?t care  
  
Happy the man - he doesn?t buzz around  
Nothing he wants - any more than anything  
Where you go - where?  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, nowhere  
  
Like a fool in the pool - I?m incredibly cool  
With a grin on my chin - I?m certain to win  
Someone says he?s jesus christ - but I don?t care  
  
He is a good man...  
  
  
  

Came the night a mist dissolved the trees  
And in the broken light colors fly, fading by.  
Pale and cold as figures fill the glade  
Grey is the web they spin, on and on, and on and on.  
Through the flame still summer lingers on  
Though her pictures soon shatter.  
  
All, always the same.  
But there appears in the shades of dawning,  
Though your eyes are dim,  
All of the pieces in the sky.  
  
There was once a harvest in this land.  
Reap from the turquoise sky, harlequin, harlequin,  
Dancing round, three children fill the glade,  
Theirs was the laughter in the winding stream, and in between.  
Close your door, the picture fades again  
From the flames in the firelight.  
  
All, always the same,  
But there appears in the shades of dawning,  
Though your eyes are dim,  
All of the pieces in the sky.  
  
All, all is not lost,  
And light appears in the shades of dawning  
When your eyes can see  
Order the pieces, put them back, put them back.

In life there are those decisions  
Which direction you should take  
It's only later that you realize  
All those simple mistakes you make  
I don't like being alone  
Don't want to be by myself  
But since you've gone, that's all I can think of  
I can't think of nothing else  
  
Oh, I said I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
  
Whoa, can you take me there?  
Oh, come back and take me there  
'Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
  
Yes, there is no denying  
Our love is not untrue  
I know I've lied so many times before  
But deep down there's only you  
I need you here by my side  
Together our love could grow  
But first you have to believe that I want you  
More than you'll ever know  
  
Whoa, I said I'm sorry, and I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
  
Whoa, can you take me there?  
Oh, come back and take me there  
'Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
  
(Give it up, give it up, give it up)  
With it we take our chances  
What will be will be  
But I don't care what the people may think  
Just as long as you're here with me  
Don't like being alone  
Don't want to be by myself  
And since you've gone, well, that's all I can think of  
I can't think of nothing else  
  
Whoa, I said I'm sorry, and I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up (give it up)  
You know I'm sorry, soon I give it up  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
  
Whoa, can you take me there?  
Oh, come back and take me there  
'Cause I need to be with you  
Be there with you  
You, be there with you  
  
Heart's on fire  
Heart's on fire  
Heart's on fire  
My heart's on fire  
Heart's on fire, heart's on fire...

Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  
  
Hold on my heart  
'cause I'm looking over you shoulder  
Please don't rush in this time  
Don't show her how you feel  
  
Hold on my heart  
Throw me a lifeline  
I'll keep a place for you  
Somewhere deep inside  
  
Hold on my heart  
Please tell her to be patient  
'Cause there has never been a time  
That I wanted something more  
  
If I can recall this feeling  
And I know there's a chance  
Oh I will be there  
Yes I will be there  
Be there for you  
Whenever you want me to  
Whenever you call I will be there  
Yes I will be there  
  
Hold on my heart  
Don't let her see you crying  
No matter where I go  
She'll always be with me  
  
Hold on my heart  
Just hold on to that feeling  
We both know we've been here before  
We both know what can happen  
So hold on my heart

Creeping up the blind side, shimming up the wall  
Stealing through the dark of night  
Climbing through a window, stepping to the floor  
Checking to the left and the right  
Picking up the pieces, putting them away  
Something doesn't feel quite right  
  
Help me someone, let me out of here  
Then out of the dark was suddenly heard  
Welcome to the Home by the Sea  
  
Coming out the woodwork, through the open door  
Pushing from above and below  
Shadows without substance, in the shape of men  
Round and down and sideways they go  
Adrift without direction, eyes that hold despair  
Then as one they sign and they moan  
  
Help us someone, let us out of here  
Living here so long undisturbed  
Dreaming of the time we were free  
So many years ago  
Before the time when we first heard  
Welcome to the Home by the Sea  
  
Sit down, sit down  
As we relive our lives in what we tell you  
  
Images of sorrow, pictures of delight  
Things that go to make up a life  
Endless days of summer longer nights of gloom  
Waiting for the morning light  
Scenes of unimportance like photos in a frame  
Things that go to make up a life  
  
Help us someone, let us out of here  
Living here so long undisturbed  
Dreaming of the time we were free  
So many years ago  
Before the time when we first heard  
Welcome to the Home by the Sea  
  
Sit down, sit down  
As we relive our lives in what we tell you  
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you  
  
Sit down sit down  
Cause you won't get away  
So with us you will stay  
For the rest of your days. so sit down  
As we relive our lives in what we tell you  
Let us relive our lives in what we tell you

Hot sun beating down  
Burning my feet just walking around.  
Hot sun making me sweat  
'Gators getting close hasn't got me yet  
  
I can't dance, I can't talk.  
Only thing about me is the way I walk.  
I can't dance, I can't sing  
I'm just standing here selling everything.  
  
Blue jeans sitting on the beach,  
Her dog's talking to me, but she's out of reach.  
She's got a body under that shirt,  
But all she wants to do is rub my face in the dirt.  
  
Cause, I can't dance, I can't talk.  
Only thing about me is the way I walk.  
I can't dance, I can't sing  
I'm just standing here selling  
Oh and checking everything is in place,  
You never know who's looking on.  
  
Young punk spilling beer on my shoes,  
Fat guy's talking to me trying to steal my blues.  
Thick smoke, see her smiling through.  
I never thought so much could happen just shooting pool.  
  
But I can't dance, I can't talk.  
Only thing about me is the way that I walk.  
I can't dance, I can't sing  
I'm just standing here selling  
Oh and checking everything is in place  
You never know who's looking on  
A perfect body with a perfect face  
  
Mmm Hmmm  
  
No I can't dance, I can't talk.  
Only thing about me is the way I walk.  
No I can't dance, I can't sing.  
I'm just standing here selling everything.  
  
No I can't walk.  
No I can't dance.  
No no no I can't dance.  
No I said I can't sing.

Leaving all the world to play  
They disappear  
And the leaves have gathered dust to run like deer  
Tearing pieces from our lives to feed the dawn  
Mist surrounds the seagulls, christened by the storm  
Music, all I hear is music  
Guaranteed to please  
And I look for something else  
Rain drops pouring down the rooftops  
Flowing in the drains  
As the people run their lives  
As their lives are run by time  
Fighting enemies with weapons made to kill  
Death is easy as a substitute for pride  
Victors join together, happy in their bed  
Leaving cold outside the children of the dead  
Music, all I hear is music  
Guaranteed to please  
And I look for something else  
Rain drops pouring down the rooftops  
Flowing in the drains  
As the people run their lives  
As their lives are run by time  
Music, all I hear is music  
Guaranteed to please  
And I look for something else  
Rain drops pouring down the rooftops  
Flowing in the drains  
As the people run their lives  
As their lives are run by time  
Music, all I hear is music  
Guaranteed to please  
And I look for something else  
Rain drops pouring down the rooftops  
Flowing in the drains  
As the people run their lives  
As their lives are run by time ...  

All that time I was searching, nowhere to run to, it started me thinking,  
Wondering what I could make of my life, who'd be waiting,  
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,  
Crying at the top of my voice, no one listening,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
You must believe me,  
I can feel your eyes go through me,  
But I don't know why.  
  
I know you're going, but I can't believe it's the way that you're leaving,  
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,  
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to  
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said,  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
I can feel your eyes go through me  
  
It seems I've spent too long  
Only thinking about myself  
Now I want to spend my life  
Just caring bout somebody else.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  

Brother Seems they're letting him out next year  
He's behaving himself, I hear  
Governor Conway says it will be fine  
Just as long as he can tow the line  
  
It's the same old story  
But it says here "Mum you're not to worry"  
'Cos some you lose and some you lose  
  
At this party, he was on his own  
All he did was say he'd take her home  
But it seems they didn't go straight there  
'cos on the porch, she told him,  
"put your hand here"  
  
Yes it's that same old story  
They told her mum she's not to worry  
  
Police "If what she says is so,  
we'll never let him go!"  
  
Him "Never a word could be heard  
Not even the sound of a bird  
Singing it over again, telling a different story  
Never the same as before  
See the summer going out by the door"  
Brother And now that you've paid for those lies  
Get another disguise  
  
"It's twenty years now since our Kid came free  
Oh I remember August '53  
But it wasn't quite like they said  
With that behind you, you can't plan ahead  
Yes it's the same old story  
They say you're free, but don't worry  
What they said's not so  
They'll never let you go!"  
  
Him "Never a word could be heard  
Not even the sound of a bird  
Singing it over again, telling a different story  
Never the same as before  
See the summer going out by the door"  
Brother And now that you've paid for those lies  
Get another disguise

Well I've been waiting, waiting here so long  
But thinking nothing, nothing could go wrong, but now I know  
She has a built in ability  
To take everything she sees  
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.  
  
I don't really know her, I only know her name  
But she crawls under your skin, you're never quite the same, and now I know  
She's got something you just can't trust  
It's something mysterious  
And now it seems I'm falling, falling for her.  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.  
  
She don't like losing, to her it's still a game  
Though she'll mess up your life, you'll want her just the same, now I know  
She has a built in ability  
To take everything she sees  
And now it seems I've fallen, fallen for her.  
  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
She reaches in, grabs right hold of your heart  
She seems to have an invisible touch yeah  
It takes control and slowly tears you apart.  

Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope it's gonna get better  
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me everything's gonna come around  
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me, someone's gonna see  
  
He calls me over, calls me brother and I know  
Always fighting and moonlighting, it never ends  
In the city, if you're all alone  
There's a sister and she's standing next to her man  
In the darkness you feel the sharpness of steel  
And it's always there, in the city, if you're all alone  
  
Reach out, hands in the air, don't care just what they're saying  
Hold out, just keep on hoping against hope it's gonna get better  
Don't worry, there's no hurry for you, for me everything's gonna come around  
Shout out, someone will listen to you, to me, someone's gonna see  
  
If it's gonna get better, it starts with a feeling  
If it's gonna get better, it's gonna take time  
If it's gonna get better, we've gotta start now  
'Cause I know everybody can feel it  
And I know everybody will see it  
'Cause it shows, and that shows I'm not dreaming  
'Cause you know, I know, it's time for a change

Do you see the face on the TV screen  
Coming at you every Sunday  
See that face on the billboard

Or the man I met last night  
  
Do you believe in God  
Cause that's what I'm selling  
And if you wanna go to heaven  
I'll see you right  
  
You won't even have to leave your house  
Or get out of your chair  
You don't even have to touch that dial  
Cause I'm everywhere  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
I've been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
And he's been telling me

Won't find me practicing what I'm preaching  
Won't find me making no sacrifice  
But I can get you a pocketful of miracles  
If you promise to be good, try to be nice  
God will take good care of you  
Just do as I say, don't do as I do  
  
I'm counting my blessings,  
I've found true happiness  
Cause I'm getting richer, day by day  
You can find me in the phone book,

There'll be no doubt in your mind  
You'll believe everything I'm saying  
If wanna get closer to him  
Get on your knees and start paying  
  
Cause Jesus he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
I've been talking to Jesus all my life  
Oh yes he knows me  
And he knows I'm right  
And he's been telling me

Found that man reported missing,  
He wandered in his home.  
It don't seem to bad if you consider  
Just what he's been through.  
  
Seems he met up with a gang of thieves,  
Who mistook him for a man of means,  
They locked him up then found he had no money,  
So they let him go again.  
Now he's back at home and happy  
Just to see the kids.  
  
I wish that I could really tell you  
All the things that happened to me  
And all that I have seen.  
A world full of people their hearts full of joy,  
Cities of light with no fear of war,  
And thousands of creatures with happier lives,  
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to hide.  
  
Oh, keep it dark.  
  
It seems strange to have to lie,  
About a world so bright.  
And tell instead a made-up story,  
From the world of night.  
  
I wish, that I could really tell you,  
All the things that happened to me  
And all that I have seen,  
A world full of people their hearts full of joy,  
Cities of light with no fear of war,  
And thousands of creatures with happier lives,  
And dreams of a future with meaning and no need to lie,  
No need to hate,  
No need to hide.  
  
Oh, keep it dark.

I must've dreamed a thousand dreams  
Been haunted by a million screams  
I can hear the marching feet  
They're moving into the street.  
  
Now did you read the news today  
They say the danger's gone away  
But I can see the fire's still alight  
Burning into the night.  
  
Too many men  
Too many people  
Making too many problems  
And not much love to go round  
Can't you see  
This is a land of confusion.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands we're given  
Use them and let's start trying  
To make it a place worth living in.  
  
Superman where are you now  
When everything's gone wrong somehow  
The men of steel, men of power  
Are losing control by the hour.  
  
This is the time  
This is the place  
So we look for the future  
But there's not much love to go round  
Tell me why, this is a land of confusion.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands we're given  
Use them and let's start trying  
To make it a place worth living in.  
  
I remember long ago  
When the sun was shining  
The stars were bright  
All through the night  
And the sound of your laughter  
As I held you tight  
So long ago  
  
I won't be coming home tonight  
My generation will put it right  
We're not just making promises  
That we know, we'll never keep.  
  
Too many men  
Too many people  
Making too many problems  
And not much love to go round  
Can't you see  
This is a land of confusion.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the hands we're given  
Use them and let's start trying  
To make it a place worth fighting for.  
  
This is the world we live in  
And these are the names we're given  
Stand up and let's start showing  
Just where our lives are going to.

The chamber was in confusion - all the voices shouting loud.  
I could only just hear, a voice quite near say, "Please help me through the
crowd:"  
I said if I helped her thru' she could help me too, but I could see that she
wholly blind.  
But from her pale face and her pale skin, a moonlight shined.  
  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna lead you right.  
  
When I'd led her through the people, the angry noise began to grow.  
She said, "Let me feel the way the breezes blow, and I'll show you where to
go."  
So I followed her into a big round cave, she said, "They're coming for you,
now don't be afraid."  
Then she sat me down on a cold stone throne, carved in jade.  
  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna take you thru' the tunnel of night  
Lilywhite Lilith,  
She gonna lead you right.  
  
She leaves me in my darkness,  
I have to face, face my fear,  
And the darkness closes in on me,  
I can hear a whirring sound growing near.  
I can see the corner of the tunnel,  
Lit up by whatever's coming here.  
Two golden globes float into the room  
And a blaze of white light fills the air.

I'm feeling so confused today  
It seems they've changed the rules again  
'cause in my life I'm trying hard  
To do it all so I can remain  
Healthy and sane  
  
I'll live forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
  
I heard it on the radio  
Too much of what they said wasn't so  
And now we've got to do those things  
That they brought before were so wrong  
To be healthy and strong  
  
And live forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Always one more tomorrow  
  
I know we don't need you  
I know we don't believe you  
You don't really have the answer  
You think you know better  
You think it really matters  
You just want to rule over everybody's lives  
  
I think I'll change my life today  
Gone are the times of taking care  
And I don't need a reason why  
All I need is all in a day survive in a way  
  
Or just till tomorrow  
Always one more tomorrow  
Living forever  
Do you really want to live forever

Looking for someone,  
I guess I'm doing that  
Trying to find a memory in a dark room  
Dirty man, you're looking like a Buddha, I know you well  
Yeah  
  
Keep on a straight line  
I don't believe I can,  
Trying to find a needle in a haystack,  
Chilly wind you're piercing like a dagger, it hurts me so.  
Yeah  
  
Nobody needs to discover me, I'm back again.  
You see the sunlight through the trees, to keep you warm  
in peaceful shades of green  
Yet in the darkness of my mind  
Damascus wasn't far behind.  
  
Lost in a subway,  
I guess I'm losing time.  
There's a man looking at a magazine  
You're such a fool, your mumbo-jumbo never tells me anything  
Yeah  
  
Nobody needs to discover me I'm back again  
You feel the ashes from the fire that kept you warm  
its comfort disappears  
And still the only friend I know  
Will never tell me where I go  
  
Looking for someone and now I've found myself a name  
Come away, leave me, all that I have I will give  
Leave me, leave me, all that I am I will give

Walking across the sitting-room, I turn the television off.  
Sitting beside you, I look into your eyes.  
As the sound of motor cars fades in the night time,  
I swear I saw your face change, it didn't seem quite right.  
...And it's hello babe with your guardian eyes so blue  
Hey my baby don't you know our love is true.  
  
Coming closer with our eyes, a distance falls around our bodies.  
Out in the garden, the moon seems very bright,  
Six saintly shrouded men move across the lawn slowly.  
The seventh walks in front with a cross held high in hand.  
...And it's hey babe your supper's waiting for you.  
Hey my baby, don't you know our love is true.  
  
I've been so far from here,  
Far from your warm arms.  
It's good to feel you again,  
It's been a long long time. Hasn't it?

Meanwhile lurking by a stone in the mud  
Two eyes looked to see what I was and  
Then something spoke and this is what  
It said to me...  
  
Clothes of brass and hair of brown  
Seldom need to breathe  
Don't need no wings to fly  
Ooh and a heart of stone  
And a fear of fire and water  
Who am I?  
  
Clothes of brass and hair of brown  
Seldom need to breathe  
Don't need no wings to fly  
And a heart of stone  
And a fear of fire and water  
Who am I?

I can't see you mama  
But I can hardly wait  
Ooh to touch and to feel you mama  
Oh I just can't keep away  
It's the heat and the steam of the city  
Oh it's got me running and I just can't break  
So say you'll help me mama  
Cause it's getting so hard  
  
Now I can't keep you mama

Don't take it away

It's hot, too hot for me mama  
But I can't hardly wait  
but My eyes they're burning mama and I can feel my body shake  
Don't stop, don't stop me mama' I won't make the pain, make it go away No I
won't hurt you mama  
But it's getting so hard  
  
Now I can't see you mama  
But I know you're always there  
You taunt, you tease me mama  
But I never, never can keep away  
It's the heat and the steam of the city

I'm one of many, I speak for the rest but I don't understand  
Tonight, tonight, oh tonight, tonight  
He brings another day, another night, another fight  
Well there's another day done and there's another gone by  
He's a man of our times, a man of our times  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
  
He's a man of our times, he's a man of our times, ooh ooh ooh  
And in the beating of your heart there is another beating heart  
  
All at once I can see what we do  
Me into me and you into you  
Me into me and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
Everyone is on their feet 'cause he is out  
Out on the street  
There's another day done and there's another gone by  
No more me into e and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
  
He's a man of our times, he's a man of our times, ooh ooh ooh  
And in the beating of your heart there is another beating heart  
  
All at once I can see what we do  
Me into me and you into you  
Me into me and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
Everyone is on their feet 'cause he is out  
Out on the street  
There's another day done and there's another gone by  
No more me into e and you into you  
Tonight, tonight, oh he's burning bright  
  
Man of our times, he's a man of our times  
He's a man of our times, ooh ooh ooh  
And in the beating of your heart there is another beating heart  
  
Man of our times

Many too many have stood where I stand  
Many more will stand here too,  
I think what I find strange is the way you built me up  
Then knocked me down again.  
  
The part was fun but now it's over,  
Why can't I just leave the stage?  
Maybe that's because you securely locked me up  
Then threw away the key.  
  
Oh mama,  
Please would you find the key.  
Oh pretty mama,  
Please won't you let me go free.  
I thought I was lucky  
I thought that I'd got it made.  
How could I be so blind?  
  
You said good-bye on a corner  
That I thought led to the straight.  
You set me on a firmly laid and simple course  
Then removed the road.  
  
Oh mama,  
Please help me find my way.  
Oh pretty mama,  
Please lead me through the next day.  
I thought I was lucky  
Oh I thought that I'd got it made.  
How could I be so blind? Oh no

The fires are burning in another land  
Don't start counting, don't start counting  
Colder and colder the ice is moving closer  
And gets me down  
Going round and round and down the same old track  
  
Pack on my back, going swiftly nowhere  
Heart in my ear beating like a drum  
Where will you go?  
  
All by yourself  
And now I'm standing on a corner  
Waiting in the rain  
But then in sunlight without warning  
I invent a name  
Me and Sarah Jane  
We had a special thing going  
Me and Sarah Jane  
  
It was a time of love and laughter  
It wouldn't come again  
We had our round of joy but after  
Then began the pain  
  
Me and Sarah Jane  
We had a special thing going  
Me and Sarah Jane  
Sarah Jane  
  
Searching for a clue  
Traces on the sand  
First I'm flying, going round round round  
Then I'm sliding going down down down  
Doesn't matter where I start I always end up  
Crawling through those same old crowded rooms  
  
Me and Sarah Jane  
We had it coming  
All the pain  
Walking down the streets  
And finding nothing is the same  
And now the city lights are dimming, one by one  
It costs too much money to keep them on  
  
Me and Sarah Jane  
In silence walk along the shore  
Tears of joy and mocking laughter  
Words lost in the wind  
The tide was rising  
But there we stayed  
We had no fear of dying  
We weren't afraid

There must be some misunderstanding  
There must be some kind of mistake  
I waited in the rain for hours  
You were late  
  
Now it's not like me to say the right thing  
But you could've called to let me know  
I checked your number twice, don't understand it  
So I went home  
  
Well I'd been waiting for this weekend  
I thought that maybe we could see a show  
Never dreamed I'd have this feeling  
But seeing you is believing  
That's why I don't know why  
You didn't show up that night  
  
There must be some misunderstanding  
There must be some kind of mistake  
I was waiting in the rain for hours  
You were late  
  
Since then I've been running around trying to find you  
I went to the places you always go  
I rang your home but got no answer  
Jumped in my car, I went round there  
I still don't believe it  
He was just leaving  
  
There must be some misunderstanding  
There must be some kind of mistake.  

Here am I  
Who while away the mornings  
Since you've gone  
Too long have I lay alone  
Not knowing which way to turn.  
  
And there you are  
Quite sure that you were right  
Knowing full well  
That I'd be the first one  
To go down.  
  
And you'd be the one who was laughing  
Except when things weren't going your way  
And then the lady would say that she'd had enough  
Wandering around on her own.  
  
The day you left  
Well I think you knew you'd not be back  
Well at least it would seem that way  
Because you never said goodbye.  
But when it comes round to you and me  
I'm sure it will work out alright.  
  
And you'd be the one who was laughing  
And giving me something I don't need  
And you know, I'd always hold you and keep you warm  
Oh! more fool me.  
  
Ah, but when it comes  
Round to you and me  
I ask myself  
Do I really believe  
In your love.  
  
Yes, I'm sure it will work out alright.

There is never a time to say  
Cause it seems to me we've lost our way  
So we carry on, down the road  
And we live our lives haunted by  
All the things we say and do  
Keep on missing, when I'm alone with you  
  
No there's never a time to change  
You don't get a chance to rearrange  
It's a long, long way to go  
Just to find out something, we both know  
Can't you see what's going on  
It's so sad, that a love so strong, has gone  
  
All I know is what is true  
All I ask is for you to  
Just look around and see  
  
You live your life locked in a dream  
  
Where nothing is real, and not what it seems  
We can't go on another day  
Just being afraid to say  
  
It's a long long way to fall  
When we both thought we had it all  
Well you know it's the time to say  
Cause we're all played out, we've lost our way  
Oh, I'd hoped that you would  
Be oh so understanding  
And by now you'd see, but oh no  
So sad, so sad, that's the way that it goes  
I know, I'm gonna tell you right now  

The key to my survival  
Was never in much doubt  
The question was how I could keep sane  
Trying to find a way out  
  
Things were never easy for me  
Peace of mind was hard to find  
And I needed a place where I could hide  
Somewhere I could call mine  
  
I didn't think much about it  
Til it started happening all the time  
Soon I was living with the fear everyday  
Of what might happen at night  
  
I couldn't stand to hear the  
Crying of my mother  
And I remember when  
I swore that, that would be the  
Last they'd see of me  
And I never went home again  
  
They say time is a healer  
And new my wounds are not the same  
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth  
I had to hear what he'd say  
  
He sat me down to talk to me  
He looked me straight in the eyes  
  
He said:  
  
You're no son, no son of mine  
You're no son, no son of mine  
You walked out, you left us behind  
And you're no son, no son of mine  
  
Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it  
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it  
  
You're no son, no son of mine  
But where should I go,  
And what should I do  
You're no son, no son of mine  
But I came here for help, I came here for you  
  
Well the years they passed slowly  
I thought about him everyday  
What would I do, if we passed on the street  
Would I keep running away  
  
In and out of hiding places  
Soon I'd have to face the facts  
We'd have to sit down and talk it over  
And that would mean going back  
  
They say time is a healer  
And now my wounds are not the same  
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth  
I had to hear what he'd say  
  
He sat me down to talk to me  
He looked me straight in the eyes  
  
He said:  
  
You're no son, no son of mine  
You're no son, no son of mine  
You walked out, you left us behind  
And you're no son, no son of mine

A little piece of something  
Falling gently down down down  
No one understands you like I do  
  
I'd rather be beside you  
Everything we know so well  
Tell me what you feel now  
Show me what you think of it  
  
It's not about us anymore  
It's all about the reasons  
That we think we're fighting for  
It's not about hate  
It's not about pain we always feel  
I know we have our problems  
But we're not the only ones  
It's not about you it's not about me  
It's not about anger  
It's more about the loneliness we feel  
  
How can I begin to  
Ask for some forgiveness  
For all that we have taken  
There's nothing left now  
  
Just a little piece of something  
Falling gently down down down  
No one understands you no no  
Like I do  
There's nothing left now  
  
It's not about us anymore  
It's all about the reasons  
That we think we're fighting for  
It's not about hate  
It's not about pain we always feel  
I know we have our problems  
But we're not the only ones  
It's not about you it's not about me  
It's not about anger  
It's more about the loneliness we feel  
  
It's not about us  
It's not about hate  
It's more about the loneliness we feel, can you feel it  
It's not about anger  
It's not about wanting  
I know we have our problems  
But we're not the only ones, we're not the only ones  
It's not about you, it's not about me

Would it be asking too much of you  
To let me stay tonight  
Until I find my way back home again  
Life's been so simple lately  
I don't want to go away  
There is precious little left for me to say  
  
I've go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
There's no-one to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Won't you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
And there's no need to be disguising all your feelings  
Cos I can't leave you alone  
I've got nowhere else to turn  
  
Would it be taking a liberty  
In loving you tonight  
I just want to hold you close again  
I get so lonely sometimes  
Then I think of you  
There is precious little else that I can do  
  
I've go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
There's no-one to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Won't you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
I've go nowhere else to turn  
Will you help me tonight  
There's no-one to stand in our way  
I just want to feel needed  
Won't you give me a chance  
I know that you want me to stay  
  
And there's no need to be disguising all your feelings  
Cos I can't leave you alone  
I've got nowhere else to turn  
  
Would it be taking a liberty  
In loving you tonight  
I just want to hold you close again  
I get so lonely sometimes  
Then I think of you  
There is precious little else that I can do

Well there's a place where two worlds collide  
The pile of stone against the pull of the tide  
You can stay with your feet on the ground  
Or step into the water, leave the dry behind  
  
On the shoreline  
Meet me on the shoreline  
Where you can only swim if you try  
  
Well, if there's somewhere on the other side  
It might be better, it might be as bad  
Someday soon you'll have to make a move  
Cos you can't stay forever, ah just waiting  
  
On the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Meet me on the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
  
Take me over, lead me through  
  
Well can you take me there, to the other side  
Where everything is new, uncertain and strange  
Don't ever let me go till we're there  
I don't know what it is I'm looking for  
And until it's found I won't be sure  
  
Well, there are squares in the game of life  
When you can keep on moving or turn aside  
Yes, there are times when you have to decide  
To put your feet in the water, or stay  
  
On the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Meet me on the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Where you can only swim if you try  
I'll be there, oh  
On the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
I'll be there on the shoreline (on the shoreline)  
Where you can only swim if you try  
I'll be there  
I'll be there, oh  
Yes, I'll be there  
I'll be there

Don't get me wrong  
I think I'm in love  
But the feeling in the word is more  
That your crystal eyes will ever see in me  
Don't get me wrong  
Open your eyes  
Although I cannot show my heart  
I'll watch and hope  
While you are near to me  
  
One day I'll capture you  
And call you to my side  
One day I'll take you from  
The boredom of our lives  
One day we'll fly away  
To the kingdom of my dreams  
One day I'll find myself  
And wrap it in my love for you  
  
Birds of the sky  
May I borrow your wings  
Very soon I'll ask my love  
To travel with me to the world outside  
Cherry trees, may I borrow your bloom  
Very soon I'll ask my love  
To come inside the nest I'll build alone  
  
One day I'll capture you  
And call you to my side  
One day I'll take you from  
The boredom of our lives  
One day we'll fly away  
To the kingdom of my dreams  
One day I'll find myself  
And wrap it in my love for you  
  
Animal friends  
Help me decide  
When should I ask my love to leave  
I'll beg of you that she'll say yes to me  
Breathe in deep  
Now is the time  
She looks at me and gently smiles  
As if she new  
I'd ask her all the time  
  
One day I'll capture you  
And call you to my side  
One day I'll take you from  
The boredom of our lives  
One day we'll fly away  
To the kingdom of my dreams  
One day I'll find myself  
And wrap it in my love for you

Mister you've been caught at last chasing dogs in moonlight  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
Have you seen the one eyed hound ?  
Tell me where he's going  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
Every place that I have been, no-one else has seen him  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
Everybody's telling me exactly where to go  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
People come and people talk but they don't reach agreement  
This man committed a sin  
This man he never can win  
And it's all gone wrong  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  
And it's all been tried before  
Night is the time for chasing the one eyed hound  

Fifty thousand men were sent to do the will of one.  
His claim was phrased quite simply, though he never voiced it loud,  
I am he, the chosen one.  
  
In his name they could slaughter, for his name they could die.  
Though many there were believed in him, still more were sure he lied,  
But they'll fight the battle on.  
  
Then one whose faith had died  
Fled back up the mountainside,  
But before the top was made,  
A misplaced footfall made him stray  
From the path prepared for him.  
Off of the mountain,  
On to a wilderness of ice.  
  
This unexpected vision made them stand and shake with fear,  
But nothing was his fright compared with those who saw him appear.  
Terror filled their minds with awe.  
  
Simple were the folk who lived  
Upon this frozen wave.  
So not surprising was their thought,  
This is he, God's chosen one,  
Who's come to save us from  
All our oppressors.  
We shall be kings on this world.  
  
Follow me!  
I'll play the game you want me,  
Until I find a way back home.  
  
Follow me!  
I give you strength inside you,  
Courage to win your battles -  
  
No, no, no, this can't go on,  
This will be all that I fled from.  
Let me rest for a while.  
  
He walked into a valley,  
All alone.  
There he talked with water, and then with the vine.  
  
They leave me no choice.  
I must lead them to glory or most likely to death.  
  
They traveled cross the plateau of ice, up to its edge.  
Then they crossed a mountain range and saw the final plain.  
Still he urged the people on.  
  
Then, on a distant slope,  
He observed one without hope  
Flee back up the mountainside.  
He thought he recognized him by his walk,  
And by the way he fell,  
And by the way he  
Stood up, and vanished into air

As the buildings crumble, tumble to the ground  
And the dust-filled smoke rises in the air  
You know that somebody somewhere looks with pride, they're satisfied  
  
To all who think they know  
To everyone that knows that they're right  
D'you ever wonder why  
D'you never ask the question even in the depths of night?  
  
Now as the daylight fading ends another day  
For too many life will never be the same  
And it is all for the reason they will never understand  
  
To all who think they know  
To everyone that knows that they're right  
D'you ever wonder why  
D'you never ask the question even in the depths of night?  
  
And on the morning after do you realize  
See the ruined faces and the ruined lives  
Inside your head do you never have the thought a moment of doubt?  
  
To all who think they know  
To everyone that knows that they're right  
D'you ever wonder why  
D'you never ask the question even in the depths of night?  
  
There are only dreams one like any other  
What means the earth to one or few means nothing to another  
There are only dreams like any other  
  
Drawing lines upon the sand, on the land, on the sea  
Then dying to defend them seems quite meaningless to me  
  
Don't you know what means the earth to some or only one  
Can mean just nothing nothing nothing to another  
  
There are only dreams like any other  
There are only differences, worth living but not dying for  
  
One man's joy makes another man weep  
Nothing you can do is ever gonna change it  
One man's saint is another man's fool  
One man's hot is another man's cool  
  
And when the war is over, won  
Will there be peace for evermore?  
  
Statues carved right out of stone, out of wood, made from gold  
Praying for their mercy that won't save their souls  
  
Don't you know what means the earth to some or only one  
Can mean just nothing nothing nothing to another  
  
There are only dreams like any other  
There are only hopes and beliefs one like any other (there are only dreams
like any other)  
Worth living but not dying for  
Living but not dying for not killing for  
There are only dreams like any other like any other  
  
To all of those who think that they know  
All I can say yes all I can say  
  
One man's joy makes another man weep  
Nothing you can do is ever gonna change it  
One man's saint is another man's fool  
One man's hot is another man's cool  
  
There are only dreams like any other  
There are only hopes and beliefs, one like any other  
There are only dreams like any other

I see your smiling face, by the open door  
There's the morning light  
Shining in your hair, and in your eyes  
  
And just a little way behind that smile of yours  
I see another one, oh so far away  
If only for one second, I could hold you close to me  
When the Master calls for me again  
There's nothing I can say, or I can do  
  
Goodbye, my love  
Time has come to say farewell  
I hear the call again  
Goodbye to the world  
I've shouted for so long  
Oh there's so much my love, that I can never say  
  
And in a little while, in a little while  
There's nothing left to see  
  
As the years go by and I have not returned  
And the night has come, falling all around  
Ooh if you count the stars you'll know  
How many have gone out  
And when the Master calls for me again  
There's nothing that I can say  
Or I can do  
  
Stand in the sun  
Shut your eyes and feel the world  
It's changing every day  
Goodbye my love  
Each day will seem so long  
Ooh there's so much I feel, that I can never say  
  
I can't see you  
I can't feel you anymore  
I've just a memory of that open door

Pacidy, my love  
Glowing ember of evening  
Your eyes are frozen with guilt  
I read my fate on your cheeks  
The smoldering coals of a passion  
Once a meadow of hope  
  
Days of minstrels and bright steeds  
Autumn nights and silk sheets  
Your tender battle shadow on me  
Scented lavender kiss-es, soft and warm  
The union of strength in a love against life  
Love against life  
  
Pacidy, my love  
Your touch, so limp, was once frenzied  
Your argon lips were once sweet  
A life has slipped through my hands  
My spirits sift in a stale sigh  
Did love exist as a dream?  
  
Mother fawn of a pine wood  
Shepherdess of my grief  
Veils a freedom not for me  
Far beyond the steep ridge, where blizzards  
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts  
Frailest of beasts  
  
Where blizzards  
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts  
Frailest of beasts  
  
Where blizzards  
Blast the spirit of man, the frailest of beasts  
Frailest of beasts

Paperlate paperlate  
Paperlate paperlate  
  
Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but there is no one on the line  
Paperlate, oh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news  
  
Oh it's too easy to live like clockwork  
Tick tock watching the world go by  
Any change would take too long  
So dry your eyes  
Ooh it's too easy to live in a cold sweat  
Just sitting dripping in pools below  
You can wipe your face  
Kill the pain  
But the fever won't go, no no  
  
Paperlate  
Pull it together now  
Put your feet back on the ground  
Paperlate  
Ooh don't worry now  
You're not alone  
Look around you  
Paperlate  
Ooh I'm sorry but there's no one on the line  
Paperlate  
Ooh I'm sorry but rest easy no news is good news  
  
Oh it's too easy to compute your future  
Taking no risks and playing too safe  
Any change would take too long  
So dry your eyes  
Ooh it's too easy to talk about rocking the boat  
Making changes and changing track  
But you'd better not lock that door  
'Cause you'll be coming back  
  
Ah you're breathing faster  
Silence the only sound  
There's no need to be nice on the way up  
'Cause you're not coming down

Who put fifty tons of shit on the Foreign Office roof?  
Who suffers from nine known diseases?  
Who gets up in the morning when the sun comes up  
And makes their beds, paper clips, bus tickets  
All around their heads?  
Who congregate around Trafalgar Square  
Taking pot shots at the tourists?  
Oh you've got to watch out  
When you wander round the square in the morning  
Cos they're everywhere, they're everywhere  
  
Here we have an honest man  
A civil servant to boot  
He lived high up in the Ministry  
And when he wished to make a point  
He knew just what to do  
His window ledges were all covered in grease  
"I want them out of here"  
  
He said to me, "I want them gone"  
Because you see - Oh don't you see  
None of us are getting any younger  
You've got to follow your nose  
And if it tells you that you've got to go  
Well that's because, they're everywhere,  
They're everywhere  
  
So we called in those men, those horrible men  
We set them to work on the rooftops  
You see their van is very plain  
And I know they're too ashamed  
To wear their by appointment badges anymore  
Sometimes they use vaseline, sometimes they use the pill  
I've often seen them with a gun  
But as the years go by, old habits seem to die  
And nowadays they knockatize them all  
Oh you've got to watch out  
As you wander round the square in the morning  
Oh they're everywhere, they're everywhere

Please don't ask me how I feel, I feel fine  
Oh I cry a bit, don't sleep too good, but I'm fine  
When can I see you?  
When can I see you?  
  
Again and again I ask myself was I wrong?  
Oh but time's a healer, and heaven knows I've been strong  
Maybe we could try  
Maybe we could work this time  
  
I can remember when it was easy to say I love you  
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do  
  
But I can try  
I know that the kids are well, you're a mother to the world  
But I miss my boy  
I hope he's good as gold  
  
But enough of me, tell me how are you? You look good  
Oh you've lost weight I can see, your hair looks nice, you look good  
Maybe we should try, don't say it! I know why  
  
I can remember when it was easy to say I love you  
But things have changed since then, now I really can't say if I still do  
  
But I can try  
I know that the kids are well, you're a mother to the world  
But I miss my boy  
I hope he's good as gold

Blue girls come in every size  
Some are wise and some otherwise  
They got pretty blue eyes  
For an hour a man may change  
For an hour her face looks strange  
Looks strange, looks strange  
  
Marching to the promised land  
Where the honey flows and takes you by the hand  
Pulls you down on your knees  
While you're down a pool appears  
The face in the water looks up  
And she shakes her head as if to say  
That it's the last time you'll look like today  
  
Sail away, away  
Ripples never come back  
Gone to the other side  
Sail away, sail away  
  
The face that launched a thousand ships  
Is sinking fast, that happens you know  
The water gets below  
Seems not very long ago  
Lovelier she was than any that I know  
  
Angels never know it's time  
To close the book and gracefully decline  
The song has found a tale  
My, what a jealous pool she is  
The face in the water looks up  
She shakes her head as if to say  
That the blue girls have all gone away  
  
Sail away, away  
Ripples never come back  
They've gone to the other side  
Look into the pool  
Ripples never come back  
Dive to the bottom and go to the top  
To see where they have gone  
Oh, they've gone to the other side

The streets were deserted though the police were alerted  
They considered the phone call a hoax  
Furtively glancing the jauntily prancing  
The youth caught the guards unaware  
  
Slipping between them he ought to have seen the  
The eyes and their owner so near  
With torch shining bright he strode on in the night  
Till he came to the room with the safe  
  
"Hello son, I hope you're having fun"  
"You've got it wrong Sir, I'm only the cleaner"  
With that he fired, the other saying as he died  
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever  
  
Robbery, assault and battery  
The felon and his felony  
  
He picked up the diamonds and bundles of fivers  
He pushed them well down in his sack  
But the alarm had been sounded, he was completely surrounded  
  
But he had some more tricks up his sleeve  
  
"Come outside with your hands held high"  
"You'll not get me alive Sir, I promise you that Sir"  
With that he fired, the other saying as he died  
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever  
  
Robbery, assault and battery  
The felon and his felony  
  
"He's leaving via the roof, the bastard's got away  
God always fights on the side of the bad man"  
  
"I've got clean away but I'll be back some day  
Just the combination will have changed  
Some day they'll catch me, to a chain they'll attach me  
But until that day I'll side the old crime wave  
  
If they try to hold me for trial  
I'll stay out of jail by paying my bail  
And after I'll go to the court of appeal saying  
"You've done me wrong", it's the same old song forever"

Say it's alright Joe  
  
Say it's alright Joe,  
I need another drink  
To blow on the glass so I know I'm alive  
  
Play me a song Joe  
To fill the hours till morning  
Then never again will I bother you  
Ooh, build myself a tower  
No way in no way out.  
Then my friends can visit me  
Once in a while.  
  
Say it's alright Joe.  
I need some reassurance  
You never know what you might find in the night.  
Ooh I'm just a busy bee, still alone in my hive,  
I'm looking for some other world  
To dream out my dreams.  
  
There were kings who were laughing in the rain  
And they told me I'd come here to lead the parade  
All the colors were changing, the sky was in ruins  
The lights are all shining on me and on you  
Shine on  
  
Say it's alright Joe  
The night will soon be over  
And nothing and no one will ever know.  
Open my eyes Joe  
I'd like to see the daylight  
The clock on the wall says it's time to leave.  
Never seen the same face twice  
Never walked the same way  
The little love that I have known  
I keep to myself.  
  
If there's a fire it's asleep in my bed  
I must leave it to burn until it burns itself out  
Catch as you can I'm not staying here long  
I'll be coming back early or never at all  
Shine on

Little Nemo rubbed his eyes and got out of bed,  
trying hard to piece together a broken dream.  
His visions lifelike and full of imagination  
it's strange to think they came from such a tiny head.  
  
Dragons breathing fire, but friendly.  
Mushrooms tall as houses.  
Giant Nymphs and goblins playing,  
scenes from a night's dream, poor Little Nemo!  
  
Eating all kinds of food so close to bedtime  
they always made him have these nightmares, it seemed.  
  
Helped young Washington in the garden,  
cut the cherry tree down.  
Now we all know that's not history,  
scenes from a night's dream, poor Little Nemo!  
  
"Nemo, get out of bed!"  
"Don't tell me stories, I don't want to know!"  
"Come on you sleepy head, we're waiting to go!"  
  
Once he went to the 'Carnival of Nations'  
dancing with the princess through the night.  
  
Found themselves on a moving platform  
ten ton weights above them,  
seeking audience with King Morpheus.  
Scenes from a night's dream, poor little Nemo!  
  
"Nemo, get out of bed!"  
"Don't tell me stories, I don't want to know!"  
"Come on you sleepy head, we're waiting to go!"

I heard the old man tell his tale:  
  
Tinker, alone within a storm,  
And losing hope he clears the leaves beneath a tree,  
Seven stones  
Lay on the ground.  
Within the seventh house a friend was found.  
And the changes of no consequence will pick up the reins from nowhere.  
  
Sailors, in peril on the sea,  
Amongst the waves a rock looms nearer, and not yet seen.  
They see a gull  
Flying by.  
The Captain turns the boat and he asks not why.  
And the changes of no consequence will pick up the reins from nowhere.  
Nowhere.  
  
Despair that tires the world brings the old man laughter.  
The laughter of the world only grieves him,  
Believe him,  
The old man's guide is chance.  
  
I heard the old man tell his tale:  
  
Farmer, who knows not when to sow,  
Consults the old man clutching money in his hand.  
And with a shrug,  
The old man smiled,  
Took the money, left the farmer wild.  
And the changes of no consequence will pick up the reins from nowhere.  
Nowhere.  
  
Despair that tires the world brings the old man laughter.  
The laughter of the world only grieves him, believe him,  
The old man's guide is chance.

Vanity arrived with fame  
How she loved to see her name  
She is beautiful, very beautiful  
Look at her, and she's a model  
  
Hey girl I love you but you won't listen  
To what I'm trying to say  
Things won't work out if you plan them now  
Don't throw your love away  
Give it up, baby  
Honey give it up and come back to me

Don't take my love away from my arms  
Oh no, I need her near me every single day  
Please don't take her away  
I need my love

I'm a million miles from anywhere, where can I be  
Somewhere out on the ocean  
Just take a look out on the horizon, what can you see  
There's nothing there for me  
  
I feel shipwrecked, I might as well be shipwrecked  
I'm helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I can't believe what you said to me  
  
Even standing on the corner of a busy city street  
I still feel so lonely  
Why do you say you want to be with me  
But the next day say you don't  
  
I'm shipwrecked, I might as well be shipwrecked  
I'm helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I can't believe what you said to me  
Without you I feel shipwrecked  
But I can't let it show  
A million miles away from anywhere, ooh, ooh, ohh  
  
Is it my imagination  
Or is it getting darker, are the waves getting higher  
I'm a million miles from anywhere  
A million miles from anything I know  
  
You know that's why I'm shipwrecked  
I might as well be shipwrecked  
I'm helpless and alone drifting out to sea  
I can't believe what you said to me  
You know that's why I'm shipwrecked, shipwrecked  
Losing my direction  
Please come and rescue me (shipwrecked)  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked  
Shipwrecked

Well I heard you sold them America  
You said it was built to last  
Price is right, the time is now  
You said it was going fast  
  
Well I've got my beliefs  
And I don't agree with a single word you say  
A convincing smile, a twist of truth  
You seem to get your way  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head  
  
Well they call you Mr Cover  
A predator at heart  
A man who's reputation  
Was dangerous from the start  
You lie and you steal, cheat and you rob  
Sold anything you could  
You never had a second thought for people that you hurt  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head  
  
It's been so many years  
Well you've hurt so many people  
As you've singed their lives away  
Do you ever spare a moment's thought about the price they have to pay?  
  
And they believed you  
With every word you said  
It always sounded so convincing  
As you signed their life away  
So tell me what you're thinking  
When you lie in your bed  
The suffering you've caused  
Surely it must go around your head...

Rivers flow uphill  
Blue turns into grey  
Winter follows springtime  
Morning ends the day  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
If you're walking home beside her  
And you know what time it is  
And if you avoid the puddles in your way  
You haven't been there either  
To the land that lies  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
But if you're walking home beside her  
And the sun should turn to blue  
And you keep on going 'cause you're unaware  
Then you know that you are there  
  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
You won't know if you're coming or going  
  
If you're sitting there beside her  
With your arms you hold her close  
And you're wondering just how far she'll let you go  
You haven't been there either  
To the land that lies  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
  
But if you're sitting there beside her  
And a bear comes in the room  
And you keep on going 'cause you're unaware  
Then you know that you are there  
  
Beyond the silver rainbow  
You won't know if you're coming or going

It seems in a moment, your whole world can shatter  
Like morning dreams they just disappear  
Like dust in your hand falling to the floor  
How can life ever be the same  
  
'Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since you've been gone  
  
It's all too easy to take so much for granted  
But it's so hard to find the words to say  
Like a castle in the sand the water takes away  
How can life ever be the same  
  
'Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since I've lost you  
  
Ooh now you'll never see  
Ooh now you'll never know  
All the things I planned for you  
Things for you and me  
  
I held your hand so tightly  
That I couldn't let it go  
Now how can life ever be the same  
  
'Cause my heart is broken in pieces  
Yes my heart is broken in pieces  
Since you've been gone

Don't talk back to me, don't talk back to me  
Don't talk back to me, don't talk  
  
Going round in circles, hearing too many points of view  
Just words to tire me out, small talk I could do without  
I would be amazed if you returned to see things my way  
Now that you've been disrespectful to my sense of pride  
  
Isn't it a shame that you were lying when you said to me (small talk)  
I was the only one, you and I were meant to be  
I expect you'll never really feel the way that I do  
All of this is with regret, I'm sure you will agree  
  
Say something to me, anything at all  
I want you to mean what you say  
I've seen all I want to see, and you mean the world to me  
I've lived for each moment to be with you, with you, with you  
  
Small talk, small talk, small talk, small talk  
  
You say I don't talk enough, that applies to both of us  
Don't try to sound me out, something I could do without  
So much goes on inside your head, I often wonder  
Have you heard enough to know, there's nothing left to say  
  
Say something to me, anything at all  
I want you to mean what you say  
I've seen all I want to see, and you mean the world to me  
I've lived for each moment to be with you, with you, with you  
  
Small talk  
Small talk  
Ooh small talk  
That's all I ever hear  
Small talk  
  
I'll be alright  
It may take sometime  
But I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(don't want to be alone, nothing worth to carry on)  
  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(try hard to understand, you won't seem to lend a hand)  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(without you'll fail to see, you never spare a thought for me)  
  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(so many things you said, going round in circles)  
I'll be alright (don't talk back to me)  
(I'll rise above it all, enough to see another day)  
  
I'll be alright  
I'll be alright  
Don't talk back to me...

Lay your body down upon the midnight snow  
Feel the cold of winter in your hair  
Here in a world of your own  
In a casing that's grown  
To the children's delight  
That arrived on the night  
  
Here they come to play their magic games  
Carving names upon your frozen hand  
Here in a world of your own  
Like a sleeper whose eyes  
Sees the pain with surprise  
As it smothers your cries  
They'll never, never know  
  
Hey there's a Snowman  
Hey, hey what a Snowman  
Pray for the Snowman  
Ooh, ooh what a Snowman  
They say a snow year's a good year  
Filled with the love of all who lie so deep  
  
Smiling faces tear your body to the ground  
Covered red that only we can see  
Here in a ball that they made  
From the snow on the ground  
See it rolling away  
With wild eyes to the sky  
They'll never, never know  
  
Hey there's a Snowman  
Hey what a Snowman  
Pray for the Snowman  
Ooh, ooh what a Snowman  
They say a snow year's a good year  
Filled with the love of all who lie so deep  
  
Hey there goes the Snowman  
Hey there what a Snowman  
Hey there lies a Snowman  
Hey there was a Snowman  
They say a snow year's a good year  
Filled with the love of all who lie so deep  
  
Hey there goes the Snowman

Like father like son  
Not flesh nor fish nor bone  
A red rag hangs from an open mouth.  
Alive at both ends but a little dead in the middle,  
A-tumbling and a-bumbling he will go.  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Could never put a smile on that face.  
  
He's a sly one, he's a shy one  
Wouldn't you be too.  
Scared to be left all on his own.  
Hasn't a, hasn't a friend to play with, the ugly duckling  
The pressure on, the bubble will burst before our eyes.  
All the while in perfect time  
His tears are falling on the ground  
But if you don't stand up you don't stand a chance.  
  
Go a little faster now, you might get there in time.  
  
Mirror mirror on the wall,  
His heart was broken long before he ever came to you.  
Stop your tears from falling,  
The trail they leave is very clear for all to see at night  
All to see at night.  
  
In season, out of season  
What's the difference when you don't know the reason.  
In one hand bread, the other a stone.  
The hunter enters the forest.  
All are not huntsmen who can blow the huntsman's horn  
By the look of this one you've not got much to fear.  
  
Here I am, I'm very fierce and frightening  
Come to match my skill to yours.  
Now listen here, listen to me, don't you run away now  
I am a friend, I'd really like to play with you.  
Making noises my little furry friend would make  
I'll trick him, then I'll kick him into my sack.  
You better watch out you better watch out.  
  
I've got you, I've got you, you'll never get away.  
  
Walking home that night  
The sack across my back, the sound of sobbing on my shoulder.  
When suddenly it stopped,  
I opened up the sack, all that I had  
A pool of bubbles and tears - just a pool of tears.  
  
All in all you are a very dying race  
Placing trust upon a cruel world.  
You never had the things you thought you should have had  
And you'll not get them now,  
And all the while in perfect time  
Your tears are falling on the ground.

To Thomas S.Eiselberg, a very rich man, who was wise  
Enough to spend all his fortunes in burying himself  
Many miles beneath the ground. as the only surviving  
Member of the human race, he inherited the whole world.  
  
Stagnation  
  
Here today the red sky tells his tale,  
But the only listening eyes are mine  
There is peace amongst the hills,  
And the night will cover all my pride.  
Blest are they who smile from bodies free,  
Seems to me like any other crowd  
Who are waiting to be saved.  
  
Wait, there is still time for washing in the pool,  
Wash away the past  
Moon, my long-lost friend is smiling from above,  
Smiling at my tears.  
Come we'll walk the path to take us to my home,  
Keep outside the night.  
The ice-cold knife has come to decorate the dead,  
Somehow  
  
And each will find a home,  
And there will still be time,  
For loving my friend  
You are there  
And will I wait for ever, beside the silent mirror  
And fish for bitter minnows amongst the weeds  
And slimy water.  
  
I want to sit down.  
I want to take a drink of water  
I want a drink  
I want a drink.  
To take all the dust and the dirt from my throat.  
I want a drink.  
I want a drink.  
To wash out the filth that is deep in my guts.  
I want a drink.  
  
Then let us drink  
Then let us smile  
Then let us go

Every morning when the people are out  
And I'm free move around on my own  
I look into the sun and I see a reflection  
Of a sad and lonely shrivelled man  
That's me, that's me  
And I know it's how I'm always gonna be  
  
Nothing to do, nothing to say  
Nothing to hope, and nothing to pray  
  
I can see, I can feel  
I've forgotten what I'm meant to be  
Won't come back, not if I try  
  
They told me things about me that I didn't know  
But I could tell they've told me lies  
And it really goes to show  
That everyone was wrong  
And they don't understand my ways  
But it's not me that's going wrong, it's them  
  
I can see, I can feel  
I've forgotten what I'm meant to be

And it really goes to show  
That everyone was wrong  
And they don't understand my ways  
But it's not me that's going wrong, it's them  
  
Every morning when the people are out  
And I'm free move around my own  
I look into the sun and I see a reflection  
Of a sad and lonely shrivelled man  
  
That's me, that's me  
And I know it's how I'm always gonna be  
  
That's me, that's me  
And I know it's how I'm always gonna be  
  
Shrivelled old man  
Who hides from a world  
He's never seen the light  
That can set him free  
His vicious life  
Is such a shame  
I wanna find out who's to blame  
  
And that's me, oh that's me, aaoh  
Set me free

Home from work our juliet  
Clears her morning meal.  
She dabs her skin with pretty smells  
Concealing to appeal.  
I will make my bed,  
She said, but turned to go.  
Can she be late for her cinema show?  
  
Romeo locks his basement flat,  
And scurries up the stair.  
With head held high and floral tie,  
A weekend millionaire.  
I will make my bed  
With her tonight, he cries.  
Can he fail armed with his chocolate surprise?  
  
Take a little trip back with father tiresias,  
Listen to the old one speak of all he has lived through.  
I have crossed between the poles, for me there's no mystery.  
Once a man, like the sea I raged,  
Once a woman, like the earth I gave.  
But there is in fact more earth than sea.

He climbs inside the looking glass  
And points at everything he hates  
He calls to you hey look out son  
That's a gun they're pointing at your pretty face  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
Five hundred little women are calling at their hero's door  
Yes their hero's working overtime  
He's squirming on an empty floor  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
He's brought the castle on the hill  
He's brought it just to knock it down  
The local power shout him down  
They say he's just an empty headed clown  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
He's busy building monuments  
To hide inside his empty grave  
You there can you find some friend  
He's looking for some people to save  
And the heads they are rolling  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the justice day is coming  
For the conqueror is on his way  
And the words of love are killing him  
And the conqueror is on his way  
And the words of love were lying on an empty floor  
Just in the place where the conqueror lay  

When they went to bed that night, no one would have believed  
That in the morning light would not be there  
The dark hung heavy on the air like the grip of a jealous man  
No place was there known to have been spared  
Then panic took control of minds as fear hit everyone  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
Artificial light could hardly penetrate the gloom  
Nothing out of reach could be observed  
Looting, pillage, murder, rape became the rule of that day  
Who hit him no one knew, or whom he hit  
Cars were caught in pileups and the planes could never land  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
"Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue."  
  
Some were there who's heads were clear who sought, tried to find  
The nature of this deadly foe, the dark  
It seemed the sun was still somewhere, though hidden from their sight  
By something, though amorphous, yet alive  
And so they looked for ways to rid themselves of the parasite  
The day the light went out of the daytime sky  
  
"Now I can rest here after my journey  
Now I can feed here before I continue."  
  
They tried in many fruitless ways to see the noonday sun  
By blasting with their missiles through the dark  
But soon a kind of sleepy state came over everyone  
Till nothing seemed to stir or even breathe  
And when the darkness chose to disappear, not many had survived  
Then came a shadow - another had arrived  
And again the light went out of the daytime sky

There has always been a dividing line  
But you choose, you choose, yes you choose not to see it  
And then you wonder why you fall  
It cuts through the heart of every city  
If you climb to the top of the highest building  
You can see where it falls 'cause the streetlights stop  
The colors start to change  
You hear a voice inside you  
Not the words that you wanted to hear  
Not the things that you wanted to see hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
In the comfort and safety of your own home  
Remember those outside in the cold  
And the wind and the rain  
And take in your hands a little ray of light  
And turn it into a beam that pierces the darkness of the night  
  
There has always been a dividing line  
But you choose, you choose, yes you choose not to see it  
Sometimes we believe if we close our eyes  
The rain might wash it away  
That's why we stumble and we fall  
Not the words that you wanted to hear  
Not the things that you wanted to see hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
When everything that you hold dear to you  
Has finally faded away from your life  
The last cold ray of sunshine slowly disappears  
Round the corner of the building  
And leaves you alone  
When darkness covers the city and the streets are silent too  
What will you turn to

Tell me my life is about to begin  
Tell me that I am a hero,  
Promise me all of your violent dreams  
Light up your body with anger.  
Now, in this ugly world  
It is time to destroy all this evil.  
Now, when I give the word  
Get ready to fight for your freedom  
Now  
  
Stand up and fight, for you know we are right  
We must strike at the lies  
That have spread like disease through our minds.  
Soon we'll have power, every soldier will rest  
And we'll spread out our kindness  
To all who our love now deserve.  
Some of you are going to die -  
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide.  
  
I'll give you the names of those you must kill,  
All must die with their children.  
Carry their heads to the palace of old,  
Hang them high, let the blood flow.  
Now, in this ugly world  
Break all the chains around us,  
Now, the crusade has begun  
Give us a land fit for heroes,  
Now  
  
Stand up and fight, for you know we are right  
We must strike at the lies  
That have spread like disease through our minds.  
Soon we'll have power, every soldier will rest  
And we'll spread out our kindness  
To all who our love now deserve.  
Some of you are going to die -  
Martyrs of course to the freedom that I shall provide.  
  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom  
We are only wanting freedom ("Freedom, freedom, freedom, freedom...")  
We are only wanting freedom ("Things are getting out of control here today")  
We are only wanting freedom ("OK men - fire over their heads!")  
We are only wanting freedom  
  
We have won

The man steps out in the moonlight  
At the sound of a scream from below.  
He thinks he is a warrior  
So he picks up his sword and goes.  
  
From the mouth of the monster  
He rescues the maiden fair.  
But we know shes a demon  
Come to lure him to demons lair.  
  
Through restless foliage and tall trees he leads  
To a house in a clearing, a place in her fear she calls home.  
  
Come with me, I need you,  
I fear the dark and I live all alone.  
Ill give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like.  
  
And though his body bids him  
To enter in with her,  
There was something in her manner  
That his mind could not ignore.  
  
Also it is whispered  
In the kingdom far and wide,  
To beware a little cottage  
In the forest in a glade.  
  
For who knows what magic takes place in his world?  
So he just thanks her kindly preparing to go on his way.  
  
Come with me, I need you,  
I fear the dark and I live all alone.  
Ill give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like.  
  
Come to my garden,  
Taste the fruits and the spices of love.  
You cant resist me,  
I'm the kind that your dreams tell you of.  
  
So glad you could make it  
We had everything arranged.  
So glad you saw fit to pay a call.  
  
Some men never listen,  
And others never learn,  
But why this man did as he did  
Only he will ever know.  
  
He knew he was walking  
Into a waiting trap,  
Neatly set up for him  
With a bait so richly wrapped.  
  
So he went inside there to take on what he found  
But he never escaped them, for who can escape what he desires?  
  
Come with me, I need you,  
I fear the dark and I live all alone.  
I'll give you wine and food too  
And something special after if you like.

Play me Old King Cole  
That I may join with you,  
All your hearts now seem so far from me  
It hardly seems to matter now.  
  
And the nurse will tell you lies  
Of a kingdom beyond the skies.  
But I am lost within this half-world,  
It hardly seems to matter now.  
  
Play me my song.  
Here it comes again.  
Play me my song.  
Here it comes again.  
  
Just a little bit,  
Just a little bit more time,  
Time left to live out my life.  
  
Play me my song.  
Here it comes again.  
Play me my song.  
Here it comes again.  
  
Old King Cole was a merry old soul,  
And a merry old soul was he.  
So he called for his pipe,  
And he called for his bowl,  
And he called for his fiddlers three.  
  
But the clock, tick-tock,  
On the mantlepiece -  
And I want, and I feel, and I know, and I touch,  
HER WARMTH!  
  
She's a lady, she's got time,  
Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your face.  
She's a lady, she is mine.  
Brush back your hair, and let me get to know your flesh.  
  
I've been waiting here for so long  
And all this time has passed me by  
It doesn't seem to matter now  
You stand there with your fixed expression  
Casting doubt on all I have to say.  
Why don't you touch me, touch me,  
Why don't you touch me, touch me,  
Touch me now, now, now, now, now

Turn and run!  
Nothing can stop them,  
Around every river and canal their power is growing.  
Stamp them out!  
We must destroy them,  
They infiltrate each city with their thick dark warning odour.  
  
They are invincible,  
They seem immune to all our herbicidal battering.  
  
Long ago in the Russian hills,  
A Victorian explorer found the regal Hogweed by a marsh,  
He captured it and brought it home.  
Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge.  
Royal beast did not forget.  
He came home to London,  
And made a present of the Hogweed to the Royal Gardens at Kew.  
  
Waste no time!  
They are approaching.  
Hurry now, we must protect ourselves and find some shelter  
Strike by night!  
They are defenceless.  
They all need the sun to photosensitize their venom.  
  
Still they're invincible,  
Still they're immune to all our herbicidal battering.  
  
Fashionable country gentlemen had some cultivated wild gardens,  
In which they innocently planted the Giant Hogweed throughout the land.  
Botanical creature stirs, seeking revenge.  
Royal beast did not forget.  
Soon they escaped, spreading their seed,  
Preparing for an onslaught, threatening the human race.  
  
Mighty Hogweed is avenged.  
Human bodies soon will know our anger.  
Kill them with your Hogweed hairs  
HERACLEUM MANTEGAZZIANI

Dark nights, the planets are set  
Creator prepares for the dawn of man  
You're waking up, the day of incarnation  
Said your waking up to life  
Images he made to love  
Images of gods in flesh  
Man is wonderful, very wonderful, look at him  
Beware the future  
Here is my world and it's waiting for me  
Paradise before my eyes  
I am alive in a new born world  
This heaven will always be mine  
I'm waking up, the day of man has come  
I'm waking up, the day of man has come  
And God created man from dust  
With a soul inside his mould  
And God created womankind  
The vessel of Satan's hold  
Creator made the serpent wise  
Evil in his tempting eyes  
Man is wonderful, very wonderful, look at him  
Beware the future  
Here is my world and it's waiting for me  
Paradise before my eyes  
I am alive in a new born world  
This heaven will always be mine  
I'm waking up, the day of man has come  
I'm waking up, the day of man has come  
Dark nights, the planets are set  
Creator prepares for the dawn of man  
You're waking up, the day of incarnation  
Said your waking up to life  
Here I stand a child in a lonely world  
See the serpent tempting me to evil  
The guiding hand will help me on  
The guiding hand will help me on  

The silent sun that never shines  
She is the warmth of my lonely heart  
The motion of a turning wheel  
Can't you stop it and look around?  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby you've changed my life  
I'm trying to show you  
  
A tiny stone that hides from me  
Can't you see that I'm just outside?  
A mountain stream that chills the sea  
Can't you feel in your useless pride?  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby you've changed my life  
I'm trying to show you  
  
When night reveals a star-filled sky  
I want to hold it in my hands  
When snowflakes heal the ugly ground  
Your beauty hides the joy I've found  
  
Baby you feel so close  
I wish you could see my love  
Baby you've changed my life  
I'm trying to show you

He panics, feels around for a stone and hurls it at the brightest  
point. The sound of breaking  
glass echoes around the cave. As his vision is restored he catches  
sight of two golden gloves  
about one foot in diameter hovering away down the tunnel. When they  
disappear a  
resounding crack sears across the roof, and it collapses all around  
him. Our hero is trapped  
once again.  
"This is it" he thinks, failing to move any of the fallen rocks

Need I say I love you  
Need I say I care  
Need I say that emotion's,  
Something we don't share  
I don't want to be sitting here  
Trying to deceive you  
Cos you know I know baby  
I don't wanna go.  
  
We cannot live together  
We cannot live apart  
That's the situation  
I've known it from the start  
Every time that I look at you  
I can see the future  
Cos you know I know baby  
I don't wanna go.  
  
Throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
Is there nothing that I can say  
To make you change your mind  
I watch the world go round and round  
And see mine turning upside down  
You're throwing it all away.  
  
Who'll light up the darkness  
Who will hold your hand  
Who will find you the answers  
When you don't understand  
Why should I have to be the one  
Who has to convince you  
Cos you know I know baby  
That I don't wanna go.  
  
Some day you'll be sorry  
Someday when you're free  
Memories will remind you  
That our love was meant to be  
Late at night when you call my name  
The only sound you'll hear  
Is the sound of your voice calling  
Calling after me.  
  
Just throwing it all away  
Throwing it all away  
There's nothing I can say  
You're throwing it all away.  

A carved oak table,  
Tells a tale  
Of times when kings and queens sipped wine from goblets gold,  
And the brave would lead their ladies from out of the room to arbors cool.  
  
A time of valor, and legends born  
A time when honor meant much more to a man than life  
And the days knew only strife to tell right from wrong  
Through lance and sword.  
  
Why, why can we never be sure till we die  
Or have killed for an answer,  
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe  
That no race has been grander  
It seems because through time and space  
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore.  
  
A dusty table  
Musty smells  
Tarnished silver lies discarded upon the floor  
Only feeble light descends through a film of grey  
That scars the panes.  
Gone the carving,  
And those who left their mark,  
Gone the kings and queens now only the rats hold sway  
And the weak must die according to nature's law  
As old as they.  
  
Why, why can we never be sure till we die  
Or have killed for an answer,  
Why, why do we suffer each race to believe  
That no race has been grander  
It seems because through time and space  
Though names may change each face retains the mask it wore.

I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, but it's alright  
Like a load on your back that you can't see but it's alright  
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, let it go, get it away from me.  
  
Cause tonight, tonight, tonight I'm gonna make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
I'm going down, going down, like a monkey, but it's alright  
Try to pick yourself up, carry that weight that you can't see, don't you know  
it's alright  
It's like a helter skelter, going down and down, round and round but just get  
it away from me.  
  
Because tonight, tonight, tonight  
We're gonna make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
I got some money in my pocket, about ready to burn  
I don't remember where I got it, I gotta get it to you  
So please answer the phone, cause I keep calling, but you're never home  
What am I gonna do  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
I'm gonna make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
You keep telling me I've got everything, you say I've got everything I want  
You keep telling me you're gonna help me, you're gonna help me, but you don't  
But now I'm in too deep  
It's got me so that I just can't sleep  
Get me out of here, please get me out of here  
Just help me I'll do anything, anything if you'll just help me get out of
here.  
  
I'm coming down, coming down like a monkey, but it's alright  
Like a load on your back that you can't see but it's alright  
Try to shake it loose, cut it free, let it go  
But just get it away from me  
Cause tonight, tonight, tonight  
Maybe we'll make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  
  
Please get me out of here  
Someone get me out of here  
Just help me I'll do anything, anything  
If you'll just help get me out of here  
Tonight I'm gonna make it right  
Tonight, tonight, tonight.  

All I need is a TV show, that and the radio  
Down on my luck again, down on my luck again  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
It's driving me mad just another way of passing the day  
I, I get so lonely when she's not there  
I...  
  
You're just another face that I know from the TV show  
I have known you for so very long I feel you like a friend  
Can't you do anything for me, can I touch you for a while  
Can I meet you another day and we will fly away  
  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
I can show you I can show you some of the people in my life  
It's driving me mad just another way of passing the day  
I, I get so lonely when she's not there  
I...  
  
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again  
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again  
I can see another face  
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again  
I can see another face  
Turn it on, turn it on, turn it on again

Is it really true what they're saying  
Are you really sure there's nobody come for me  
When I'm walking home there is no-one  
Once there was a house, full of laughter - so warm  
Trying to pretend there is someone  
Someone who will care when I need it  
  
I will now receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow  
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again  
Now I'm down  
  
When I walk outside, there is nowhere  
Children follow me, with their laughter - so cold...  
Casting just a glance at the churchyard  
Casting just a glance, at my painted female friend.  
  
Now I'm on my way, I am falling  
Got to find some 'elp, ooh I will need that now  
  
So I will receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow  
Just a drink to make me feel like a man again  
Now I'm down...  
  
I will now receive my comfort, conjured by the magic power of wine  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling good  
Just a drink, I'll get that drink, and I'm feeling fine  
Just a drink to take my sorrow  
Just a drink and you can blast tomorrow, now...

A day of uncertain weather  
Captured in a frame forever  
A face in a faded photograph  
  
He must have had a life  
Maybe with a family  
And people who meant everything to him  
  
A sinner, a saint, a soldier  
Caught up in a war he never  
Had a chance to start or build a life  
  
All gone long ago  
Leaving no trace  
Disappearing like smoke in the wind  
To become just a face without a name  
Leaving no trace  
Disappearing like smoke in the wind  
  
Hopes and fears important plans  
Forgotten memories  
Footsteps fading in the sand  
Schemes and dreams small and grand  
Nothing left to see  
Footsteps fading in the sand  
  
Someone who cast a shadow  
Maybe just a lazy man  
Doesn't make much difference now it's true  
  
A day of uncertain weather  
Captured in a frame forever  
A face in a faded photograph  
  
All gone long ago  
Leaving no trace  
Disappearing like smoke in the wind  
To become just a face without a name  
One more to add to the total  
Of those never heard of again  
  
Yes, he's gone, just a face without a name  
Leaving no trace, disappearing like smoke in the wind

The curtains are drawn  
Now the fire warms the room.  
Meanwhile outside  
Wind from the north-east chills the air,  
It will soon be snowing out there.  
  
And some there are  
Cold, they prepare for a sleepless night.  
Maybe this will be their last fight.  
  
But we're safe in each other's embrace,  
All fears go out as I look on your face  
  
Better think awhile  
Or I may never think again.  
If this were the last day of your life, my friend,  
Tell me, what do you think you would do then?  
  
Stand up to the blow that fate has struck upon you,  
Make the most of all you still have coming to you, [or]  
Lay down on the ground and let the tears run from you,  
Crying to the grass and trees and heaven finally on your knees  
  
Let me live again, let life come find me wanting.  
Spring must strike again against the shield of winter.  
Let me feel once more the arms of love surround me,  
Telling me the danger's past, I need not fear the icy blast again.  
  
Laughter, music and perfume linger here  
And there, and there,  
Wine flows from flask to glass and mouth,  
As it soothes, confusing our doubts.  
  
And soon we feel,  
Why do a single thing to-day,  
There's tomorrow sure as I'm here.  
  
So the days they turn into years  
And still no tomorrow appears.  
  
Better think awhile  
Or I may never think again.  
If this were the last day of your life, my friend,  
Tell me, what do you think you would do then?  
  
Stand up to the blow that fate has struck upon you,  
Make the most of all you still have coming to you, [or]  
Lay down on the ground and let the tears run from you,  
Crying to the grass and trees and heaven finally on your knees  
  
Let me live again, let life come find me wanting.  
Spring must strike again against the shield of winter.  
Let me feel once more the arms of love surround me,  
Telling me the danger's past, I need not fear the icy blast again.

Watcher of the skies watcher of all  
His is a world alone no world is his own,  
He whom life can no longer surprise,  
Raising his eyes beholds a planet unknown.  
  
Creatures shaped this planet's soil,  
Now their reign has come to an end,  
Has life again destroyed life,  
Do they play elsewhere, do they know  
More than their childhood games?  
Maybe the lizard's she'd it's tail,  
This is the end of man's long union with Earth.  
  
Judge not this race by empty remains  
Do you judge God by his creatures when they are dead?  
For now, the lizard's she'd it's tail  
This is the end of man's long union with Earth.  
  
From life alone to life as one,  
Think not your journey's done  
For though your ship be sturdy, no  
Mercy has the sea,  
Will you survive on the ocean of being?  
Come ancient children hear what I say  
This is my parting counsel for you on your way.  
  
Sadly now your thoughts turn to the stars  
Where we have gone you know you never can go.  
Watcher of the skies watcher of all  
This is your fate alone, this fate is your own.

If you take the tears from crying eyes  
Will the hurt just disappear  
Put a weapon in the hand of a frightened man  
Will he show no fear  
So we stand and we watch while the city lights go out one by one  
Mother Nature sits on the other side with a loaded gun  
  
Why is there blue sky  
Why is there red sky  
Now's the time to ask the reason  
Should the blue sky  
Meet the red sky  
Should the rules have to change at all  
We all know whatever they say  
Time is on our side  
This world has been here before just going round and round and round  
  
We all agree as far as we can see  
It's just the way of the world  
That's how it's meant to be  
There's right and there's wrong  
There's weak and there's strong  
It's just the way of the world  
And that's how it's meant to be  
  
Take the motion from a spinning wheel and watch it stop  
Take the danger out of a naked flame and what have you got  
If you take the anger out of a broken heart, you feel no pain  
Could you swear if you had that second chance you wouldn't do it again  
  
Why is there blue sky  
Why is there red sky  
Now's the time to ask the reason  
Should the blue sky  
Meet the red sky  
Should the rules have to change at all  
We all know whatever they say  
Time is on our side  
This world has been here before just going round and round and round  
  
We all agree as far as we can see  
It's just the way of the world  
That's how it's meant to be  
There's right and there's wrong  
There's weak and there's strong  
It's just the way of the world  
And that's how it's meant to be

We're waiting for you  
Come and join us now

Thin hung the web like a trap in a cage,  
The fox lay asleep in his lair  
Fang's frantic paws told the tale of his sin.  
Far off the chase shrieked revenge.  
  
Outcast he trespassed where no wolf may tread,  
The last sacred haunt of the dead.  
He learnt of the truth which only one wolf may know,  
The sceptre and crown of the king.  
Howling for blood, One-eye leads on the pack,  
Plunging through forests and snow-storm.  
  
Steep rose the ridge, ghostly peaks climbed the sky,  
Fang sped through the jungles of ice.  
Hard on his tale, One-eye drew from the pack  
An old hero conquered by none.  
  
Steep, for too steep grew the pathway ahead  
Descent was the only escape  
A wolf never flees in the face of his foe  
Fang knew the price he would pay  
One-eye stood before him  
With the crown upon his head  
Sceptre raised to deal the deadly blow.  
  
Fang, son of great Fang, the Traitor we seek,  
The laws of the Brethren say this  
That only the King sees the Crown of the Gods  
And he, the Usurper must die  
  
Snarling he tore at the throat of his foe  
But Fang fought the hero in vain  
Dawn saw the white mountain tinted with red  
Never would the crown leave again  
One-eye hid the crown and with laurels on his head  
Returned amongst the tribe and dwelt in peace.

What was it you said to me  
Back in the days when things looked fine  
'Bout how we would be together  
Until we left the earth behind  
Oh, it's funny how things can change  
Cause there was a time I thought I'd be the one  
Who'd leave and start again  
But now I'd stay forever  
  
Ooh my hopes are as the leaves upon the water  
Just sunk in the night  
And though I know you couldn't care, you oughtta  
Ah, the end of a life  
Or maybe when you're older, and you're thinking back  
You might recall  
Now did I act carefully, did I do right?  
Or were we meant to be, all of our lives  
In love and harmony, all of our lives?  
  
So now, take my hand  
Come, hold me closely  
As near as you can  
Believing all that we could be  
And all that we have been  
And all that we are  
  
Everyday seems summertime  
The river flow with wine  
Ooh when you were here with me  
I wish we'd stayed that way forever  
  
Oh my hopes are as the leaves upon the water  
Just sunk in the night  
And though I know you couldn't care, you oughtta  
Ah, the end of a life  
Or maybe when you're older, and you're thinking back  
Well you might recall  
Now did I act carefully, did I do right?  
Or were we meant to be, all of our lives  
In love and harmony, all of our lives?  
  
So now, take my hand  
Come, hold me closely  
As near as you can  
Believing all that we could be  
And all that we have been  
And all that we are  
  
Oh my hopes were as the leaves upon the water  
Ah, sunk in the night  
And though I know you couldn't care, you oughtta  
Oh, the end of a life  
And maybe when you're older, and you're thinking back  
Oh, you might recall  
Now did I act carefully, did I do right?  
Or were we meant to be, all of our lives  
In love and harmony, all of our lives?  
  
So now, take my hand  
Come, hold me closely  
As near as you can  
Believing all that we could be  
And all that we have been  
And all that we are

Go far enough and you will reach,  
A place where the sea runs underneath.  
And we'll see our shadow, high in the sky,  
Drying away in the night.  
  
I've sailed the world for seven years,  
And left all I love behind in tears.  
Won't you come here, wherever you are,  
I've been alone long enough.  
  
You, you have your own special way,  
Of holding my hand keep it way 'bove the water,  
Don't ever let go  
Oh no, no, no.  
  
You, you have your own special way,  
Of turning the world so it's facing  
The way, that I'm going, don't ever  
Don't ever stop.  
  
Whose seen the wind not you or I,  
But when the ship moves she's passing by.  
Between you and me I really don't think,  
She knows where she's going at all.  
  
You, you have your own special way,  
Of carrying me twice round the world  
Never closer to home than the day,  
The day I started.  
  
You, you have your own special way,  
Hold onto my hand keep it way 'bove the water,  
Don't ever let go  
No, no, no.  
  
What mean the dreams night after night.  
The man in the moons' a blinding light.  
Won't you come out whoever you are,  
You've followed me quiet long enough.  
  
You, you have your own special way,  
Of holding my hand, don't ever let go.  
You, you have your own special way,  
Of turning the world so it's facing  
The way that I'm going, don't ever,  
Don't ever leave me.
