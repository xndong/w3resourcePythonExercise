Di ko akalain  
Hindi ko napansin  
Tumibok and aking puso  
Nang ikaw ay dumating  
Di ko inaasahan  
Iibig ng ganito  
Ang ibang mga pangarap  
Ay nalimutan ko  
Di ko akalain  
Ang nangyari sa akin  
Ikaw ang nasa isip  
Tulog man o gising  
Kahit na ilang ulit  
Ako'y papiliin  
Pangarap ba o ikaw  
Puso ang susundin  
  
Chorus:  
Akalain ko ba  
Ikaw ang aking makilalanoon ay kay saya  
Pinatibok mo itong puso  
Dibdib pinakaba  
Umiibig na nga sa iyo  
Mahal kita, akalain ko ba  
  
Bridge:  
Minamahal kita  
Ikaw nang talaga  
Di na ito biro  
Akalain ko ba  
  
[Repeat Chorus]

Di ko man maamin  
Ikaw ay mahalaga s akin  
Di ko man maisip  
Sa pagtulog ikaw ang panaginip  
  
Malabo man ang aking pgiisip  
Sana'y pakinggan mo  
Ang sigaw nitong damdamin  
  
Chorus:  
Ako'y alipin mo kahit hindi batid  
Aaminin ko minsan ako'y manhid  
Sana ay iyong naririnig  
Sa 'yong yakap ako'y nasasabik  
  
Ayoko sa iba  
Sa yo ako ay hindi magsasawa  
Ano man ang yong sabihin  
Umasa ka ito ay diringgin  
  
Madalas man na parang  
Aso at pusa giliw  
Sa piling mo ako ay masaya  
  
Ako'y alipin mo kahit hindi batid  
Aaminin ko minsan ako'y manhid  
Sana ay iyong naririnig  
Sa 'yong yakap ako'y nasasabik  
  
Pilit mang abutin ang mga tala  
Basta sa akin wag kang mawawala...  
  
Ako'y alipin mo kahit hindi batid  
Aaminin ko minsan ako'y manhid  
Sana ay iyong naririnig  
Sa 'yong yakap ako'y nasasabik  
  
Pagkat ikaw lang ang nais makatabi  
Malamig man o mainit ang gabi  
Nais ko sanang iparating  
Na ikaw lamang ang aking iibigin

All my life, without a doubt I give you  
All my life, now and forever till the  
Day I die, you and I will share  
  
All the things this changing world can offer  
So I sing, I'd be happy just to  
Stay this way, spend each day, with you  
  
There was a time, that I just thought  
That I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
We started on our way  
I do recall that every moment spent  
Was wasted time but then I chose to lay it on the line  
  
I put the past away  
I put the past away  
I put the past away  
  
All my life, I will carry you through  
All my life, between each hour of the passing days  
I will stay with you  
  
There was a time, that I just thought  
That I would lose my mind  
You came along and then the sun did shine  
(The sun did shine)  
We started on our way  
(Started on our way)  
I do recall that every moment spent  
(Hmm... Hmmm.)  
Was wasted time then I chose to lay it on the line  
  
I want this all my life  
(I want this all my life)  
I want this all my life  
I want this all my life  
(I want this all my life)  
I wanted this all my life

And I am telling you, I'm not going  
You're the best man I'll never know  
There's no way I can ever go  
No no no no way, no no no no way I'm living without you  
I'm not living without you  
I don't wanna be free  
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'  
And you, and you, you're gonna love me, ahh, ahh, ahh  
You're gonna love me.  
And I am telling you I'm not going  
Even though the rough times are showin'  
There's just, there's no way, there's no way  
We're part of the same place  
We're part of the same time  
We both share the same blood  
We both have the same mind  
And time, and time we've had so much to share  
No no no no no no, I'm not waking up tomorrow morning, ha, ha  
And fight that is, nobody else  
Darling there's no way, no no no way  
I'm not living without you,  
I'm not living without you  
You see there's just, there's no way, there's no way  
Tear down the mountains, yell ,scream and shout  
You can what you want, I'm not walkin' out  
Stop all the rivers, push, strike, and kill  
I'm not gonna leave you, there's no way I will  
And I am telling you I'm not going  
You're the best man I'll ever know  
There's no way I can ever, ever go  
No no no no way, no no no no way I'm living without you, ooh  
I'm not living without you, not living without you  
I don't wanna be free  
I'm stayin', I'm stayin'  
And you, and you, and you, you're gonna love me  
Ooh...yeah...ooh...yeah  
Love me, love me, love me, love me  
You're gonna love ... me

If we could find  
Peace in our minds  
With each passing day  
If we could live  
Believin' in dreams and what we could have been  
  
If we just hold on  
There's just so much we can hope for in life  
If we just hold on  
There's so much more left for you and me  
  
All I know  
Believe it and you shall be  
Believe it so you can see  
A brighter day in this world we live upon  
Believe it now with me  
  
If we could wait  
  
For our place in the sun  
Then we could fly so high  
If we must bathe ourselves  
In the glow of sunlight all around  
  
If we just hold on  
There's just so much we can hope for in life  
If we just hold on  
There's so much more left for you and me  
  
And I know  
Believe it and you shall be  
Believe it so you can see  
A brighter day in this world we live upon  
Believe it now with (me)  
Us holdin' on together  
Pursuing our dreams to forever  
Never to stop living life though it seems  
  
All I know  
Believe it and you shall be  
Believe it so you can see  
A brighter day in this world we live upon  
Believe it now with me

After you go, I can catch on my reading  
After you go, I have lot more time sleeping  
And when you go, it looks like thing's gonna be lot easier  
Life would be at ease you know  
I really should be glad.  
Chorus:  
But I'm bluer than blue  
Sadder than sad  
You're the only life this empty room has ever had  
Life without you is gonna be  
Bluer than blue..  
After you go, I have a lot more room in my closet  
After you go, I can stay out long if I feel like  
And when you go, I can run through half screaming  
And no one can ever hear me  
I really should be glad  
(Repeat Chorus)  
I don't have to miss no tv show  
I can start my whole life over  
Change the numbers on my telephone  
But the night will sure be colder.  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Bluer than blue  
Bluer than blue  
Bluer than blue..

Buhay ng buhay ko  
Dulot ko sa 'yo buong puso ko  
Awit, pakinggan mo  
Hayaang ako'y magtapat sa 'yo  
Aking minamahal  
Lagi kong dasal  
Bawat isip at bawat pintig ng puso mo'y akin  
Bawat pintig ng puso mo'y akin  
Tanging pangarap ko'y  
Ang sabihin mong ako'y mahala mo  
O, aking minamahal  
Lagi kong, lagi kong dasal  
Bawat isip at bawat pintig ng puso mo'y akin  
Bawat pintig ng puso mo'y akin  
Tanging pangarap ko'y  
Ang sabihin mong ako'y mahal mo.

Hey, yeah, yeah  
Day and night, you've always on my mind  
A love like ours was very hard to find  
But now your love has been taken away  
What can I do to make you stay  
Days go by, but still so much more tears to cry  
So far apart, left me with this lonely broken heart  
  
Chorus:  
Baby I can't stop thinking about love tonight  
Can't even tell you what's wrong or right  
I need you here to love me for the rest of my life  
Don't you know how much loving I have for you  
When you're not around my heart breaks in two  
Baby, I can't stop thinking about love tonight  
Can't stop thinking 'bout you?.  
  
To love is what I do best  
You'll always be better than the rest  
It won't be easy finding someone new  
'Coz there's no other one like you  
The night goes on, and I still think of you from dusk 'till dawn  
I love you so, don't know how I'm ever gonna let you  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Baby I hope you know I love you  
With all my heart and soul  
If you open your eyes, look into my heart  
You'll see the love in store for you  
  
(Instrumental)  
(Repeat Chorus 'till it fades)

Christmas wish  
  
Can't believe it's Christmas time  
And you're not here with me  
Guess some things are really just not meant to be  
I thought I'd spend these cold December nights with you  
And as the yuletide carol plays  
I'd feel the warmth of your embrace  
  
But life goes on  
I'll count my blessings and be on my way  
Everyday, I think of what the season means and pray  
That all the love the little baby in a manger gave  
Would fill my soul  
And make the heartache go away  
And someday  
  
Refrain:  
I'll wake to Christmas morning  
And the right one will be there  
I won't stop dreaming though so many times  
I've gotten nowhere  
And so I sing this song to those  
Who feel the same way too  
Let this be our Christmas wish this year  
  
Instrumental:  
  
That all the love the little baby in a manger gave  
Would fill my soul and lake the heartache go away  
And someday  
  
Repeat refrain

Dance with me, I want to be your partner.  
Can't you see the music is just starting?  
Night is falling, and I am falling.  
Dance with me.  
Fantasy could never be so giving.  
I feel free, I hope that you are willing.  
Pick your feet up, and kick your feet up.  
Dance with me.

Ooh, oh  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for a place to go  
Where they play the right music  
Getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a king  
  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen feel the beat of the tambourine, oh yeah  
  
You can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh, see that girl  
Watch that scene dig in the dancing queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave 'em burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another  
Anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance  
  
You are the dancing queen  
Young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing queen feel the beat of the tambourine, oh yeah  
  
You can dance, you can jive  
Having the time of your life  
Ooh, see that girl  
Watch that scene dig in the dancing queen

Dancing queen

Dig in the dancing queen  
Dancing queen ['till fade)

Somewhere back in time  
I was told by a friend of mine  
That I would meet someone like you  
Someday  
Well I always hoped it was true  
And I never stopped believing  
You'd come along as you did  
In just the perfect way  
Chorus:  
Days like these  
I believe  
The world's such a fine place to be  
After all here we are  
In love just you and me  
Let me take this time  
To thank you for  
Days like these  
You know there is no pot of gold  
At the end of our rainbow  
There's only love  
Simply love  
It's all that we can share  
For when we're old and gray  
And we look back on the days gone by  
We'll see the love that we shared  
Is the love we have today  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Hey, yeah, yeah  
I want to thank you baby  
Now I can't believe  
This is happening to me  
I look in your eyes  
And it's love I see  
And it's more than I thought love could be  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Days,  
Like these....

You said, "I lied"  
You screamed, I cried  
You packed your things  
You wanna leave  
You get the car keys  
And headed for the door  
  
Chorus  
Now, I'm down on my knees  
I'm beggin' you please  
Don't go, don't go  
Don't give up on us now  
We can work it out  
Don't go, don't go  
  
Maybe I'm wrong and you're right  
I said "I'm sorry"  
No, I don't wanna fight  
Just calm down  
And hold me close  
And dry the tears in my eyes  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
Bridge  
Why can't we kiss and make up  
I don't want to ever break up  
Why can't we forgive and forget  
And stay together  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
[Repeat chorus on the background]  
Don't go  
I'm down on my knees  
Oh, baby, I'm beggin' you please  
I'm beggin' you please  
Don't go  
Don't, don't go

It's over and done  
But the heartache lives on inside  
And who is the one  
You're claiming to instead of me tonight  
  
Where are you know  
Now that I need you  
Tears on my pillow  
Wherever you go  
I cry me a river  
That leads to your ocean  
You'll never see me fall apart  
In a words of a broken heart  
  
It's just emotion takin' me over  
Tired of sorrow lost in my soul  
But if you don't come back  
Come home to me darling  
'Cause you know that  
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight  
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight, goodnight  
  
I'm at your side  
A part of all the things you are  
But got a part of someone else  
You go to find your shining star  
  
Where are you know  
Now that I need you  
Tears on my pillow  
Wherever you go  
I cry me a river  
That leads to your ocean  
You'll never see me fall apart  
In a words of a broken heart  
  
It's just emotion takin' me over  
Tired of sorrow lost in my soul  
But if you don't come back  
Come home to me darling  
'Cause you know that  
Nobody left in this world to hold me tight  
Nobody left in this world to kiss goodnight, goodnight

I'm afraid to fly  
And I don't know why  
I'm jealous of the people who  
Are not afraid to die  
It's just that I recall  
Back when I was small  
Someone promised that they'd catch  
But then they'd let me fall  
  
And now I'm fallin'  
Fallin' fast again  
Why do I always take a fall  
When I fall in love  
  
You think, by now I've learned  
Play with fire, you'd get burned  
But fire can be oh so warm  
And that's why I return  
Turn and walk away  
That's what I should do  
My head says go and find the door  
My heart says I'll find you  
  
And now I'm fallin'  
Catch me if you can  
Maybe this time I'll have it all  
When I fall in love  
  
(It always turns out the same)  
(Loving someone) Loving someone (Losing myself)  
I only got me to blame  
  
Help me, I'm fallin'  
Fallin', catch me if you can  
Maybe this time I'll have it all  
Maybe I'll make it afterall  
Maybe this time I won't fall  
When I fall in love

I can't believe what's happening to me  
My heart leaps when I hear your name  
You're all I think about whenever I'm alone  
I think I'm falling  
I'm falling  
I can't believe what's happening to me  
Can't believe the joy seeing you can bring  
I never thought I'd know what it means to be in love  
But I'm falling  
I'm falling  
CHORUS:  
Falling fast, oh so fast  
I'm falling fast for you  
Oh, so fast  
Hold me fast and make my dreams come true  
Hear my heart beat faster  
Now happy ever after  
I think I've found true love in you at last  
And, love, I'm falling fast  
Oh so fast.  
I can't believe what's happening to me  
Things are brighter than they've ever been  
You've brought the light into my life  
In the wink of an eye  
Iam falling  
I'm falling  
(Repeat Chorus twice)

There was a time when I lived my life  
Thinking only of the things that would bring me down  
And all the while what I didn't know  
Is that I never learned to take the time to look around  
There's a little good in everyone  
And sometimes it takes a little work to see the sun  
If you try, you may find your life has just begun  
Don't you run  
Don't you run  
If you're feeling lost  
And you wanna be free  
And you feel like your world is tearing up at the seams  
Remember there's light  
If you wait till the dawn  
You may walk through the clouds  
But to carry on  
You've got to follow the sun  
Listen baby  
This world may be crazy  
Sometimes you'll feel like losing the game  
But there's always a reason to keep on believing  
Everyone is not the same  
But if you appreciate the things you have today  
You will find a way  
Woh....  
If you're feeling lost  
And you wanna be free  
And you feel like your world is tearing up at the seams  
Remember there's light  
If you wait till the dawn  
You may walk through the clouds  
But to carry on  
You've got to follow the sun

Driftin' on a mem'ry  
Ain't no place I'd rather be  
Than with you, ooh yeah  
Lovin' you  
Day will make a way for night  
All we need is candelight  
And a song, ooh yeah  
Soft and slow  
Well .... oohhh  
Glad to be  
Here along with the lover like no other  
Sad to see  
Anew horizon slowly comin' into view  
I wanna be livin' for the love of you  
All that I'm givin' is for the love of you  
Is for the love of you  
Lovely as a ray of sun  
That touches me when the morning comes  
Feels good to me ...  
My love, make  
Smoother than, than a gentle breez  
Flowing through my mind with ease  
Soft as can be  
When you're in love with me  
Love to be  
Ridingthe waves of your love  
Enchanted with your touch  
Seems to me we can sail together  
In and out of misery  
Oooohh  
I wanna be livin' for the love of you  
All that I'm givin', givin'  
For the love of you  
Is for the love of you  
[RAP]  
Aha  
You're my lollipop  
You're my lemondrop  
You're my sweet pea  
You're my queen bee  
When i look into your eyes  
Like a ray of sunshine  
You're the kind of girl  
I wanna sport  
When I'm on a roller ride  
I'ts love I'm livin'  
All for you  
The first girl in my life  
That I'll always be true  
Some get jealous  
Of what we got  
But there's no way to stop  
All the feelings we got  
Just the little things  
That made me gig with you  
The way you look in my eyes  
The way you find the time  
The way you touch my hand  
When I'm not in demand  
The way you make me feel fine  
When I'm cryin' at night  
Paradise within my mind  
So i huff and I puff  
But you know I ain't trippin'  
I told you before that I'll only be livin'  
For the love of you, my boo  
I wanna be livin'  
For the love  
For the love of you girl  
All that I'm givin'  
Is for the love of you  
That's why everything I do  
I do for you  
Might as well  
Sign my name on a card  
That could say it better  
Time will tell  
Cause it seems that  
I've done just about  
All that I can do  
I wanna be livin' for the love of you  
All that I'm givin' is for the love of you  
Is for the love of you  
You ... you ... you ...  
Givin' ...  
Oooh ooh ooh ooh  
Driftin' on a mem'ry  
I wanna livin for your love  
[SPOKEN]  
Hey Regine!  
What?  
What's up?  
What's up?  
Guess what?  
What?  
We're livin' for the love of you  
Ahahahah  
Is for the love of you

Love, look what you've done  
You stole my heart  
While I was waiting  
But now that you're gone  
I guess I'll keep holding on to memories  
Longing to tell you  
All of my dreams  
With you beside me  
Wanting to hold you  
That's all I need But how? It's over?  
And now I know what a fool I've been  
You told me you loved me  
And that love never ends  
I can't pretend  
It's hard to say goodbye  
Time, time be my friend  
When will this end  
This empty feeling  
Now, I'll follow the sun  
I guess I'll just carry on  
Without you...  
Longing to tell you  
All of my dreams with you beside me  
Wanting to hold you  
That's all I need  
But how? It's over...  
And now I know what a fool I've been  
You told me you loved me  
And that love never ends  
I can't pretend  
It's hard to say goodbye...  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye...

I.  
Hagkan at iyong pagmasdan  
Ang ating kaysang nagdaan  
Pagsuyo at lambingan  
Laging nakakamtan  
Ii.  
Sundan at iyong pakinggan  
Tinig ko na nagpapaalam  
Tumahan ka't magsaya  
Pagkat may sikat pa  
Refrain:  
Tignan mo ang ating umaga  
Kay tamis at may pag-asa  
O, kay sarap isipin  
Tayo'y may bukas din  
Iii.  
Ako ay magpapahinga  
Sa umaga sa 'yong pag-gising  
'Wag nang lumuha pa  
Di na iiwan pa  
(Repeat Refrain and iii)

[Intro]  
Bakit di magawang limutin ka  
Bawat sandali'y ika'y naaalala  
Tangi kong dasal sa Maykapal  
Makapiling kang muli  
  
Bakit dika maalis sa isip ko  
Ikaw ang laging laman nitong puso ko  
Kahit pilitin kong damdamin magbago  
Ikaw pa rin ang hinahanap ko  
  
[Refrain]  
Hanggang ngayon,  
Ikaw pa rin ang iniibig ko  
Ikaw pa rin ang natatanging pangarap ko  
Ikaw lamang  
Hanggang ngayon  
  
Ikaw lang ang tunay na minamahal  
Ikaw lang hinintay  
ko ng kaytagal.  
  
Ikaw ang ligaya,  
Ang buhay at pag-asa  
Ikaw lang, wala ng iba  
kaya't  
  
[Refrain]  
  
Dapat ba nating pagbigyan  
Ang ating mga puso muli pang buksan  
At ibibigay lahat ang pag-ibig na tapat.  
Sa iyo.  
Sa iyo.  
  
Hanggang ngayon,  
Ikaw pa rin ang iniibig ko  
Ikaw pa rin ang natatanging pangarap ko  
Hindi ko na kayang mag-isa  
Ikaw lamang,  
Ikaw lamang,  
Ikaw lamang,  
ikaw lamang,  
Hanggang ngayon.

Heaven  
  
Oh - thinkin' about all our younger years  
There was only you and me  
We were young and wild and free  
Now nothin' can take you away from me  
We've been down that road before  
But that's over now  
You keep me comin' back for more  
  
Chorus  
  
Baby you're all that I want  
When you're lyin' here in my arms  
I'm findin' it hard to believe  
We're in heaven  
And love is all that I need  
And I found it here in your heart  
It isn't too hard to see  
We're in heaven  
  
Oh - once in your life you find someone  
Who will turn your world around  
Bring you up when you're feelin' down  
Ya-nothin' could change what you mean to me  
Oh there's lots that I could say  
But just hold me now  
Cause our love will light the way  
  
Chorus  
  
I've been waitin' for so long  
For somethin' to arrive  
For love to come along  
Now our dreams are comin' true  
Through the good times and the bad  
Ya - I'll be standin' there by you

Verse 1:  
"adik sayo"  
Awit sa akin  
Nilang sawa na saking  
Mga kwentong marathon  
Tungkol sayo at sa ligayang  
Iyong hatid sa aking buhay  
Tuloy ang bida sa isipan ko'y ikaw......  
Chorus:  
Sa umaga't sa gabi  
Sa bawat minutong lumilipas  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Sa isip at panaginip  
Bawat pagpihit ng tadhana  
Hinahanap-hanap kita....  
Verse 2:  
Sabik sayo, kahit maghapon  
Na tayo'y magkasama  
Parang telesine  
Ang ating ending  
Hatid sa bahay ko  
Sabay goodnight  
Sabay night kiss  
Sabay bye-bye...  
Chorus:  
Sa umaga't sa gabi  
Sa bawat minutong lumilipas  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Sa isip at panaginip  
Bawat pagpihit ng tadhana  
Hinahanap-hanap kita...  
Ad lib  
Chorus 2:  
Sa umaga't sa gabi  
Sa bawat minutong lumilipas  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Sa isip at panaginip  
Bawat pagpihit ng tadhana  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Sa umaga't sa gabi  
Sa bawat minutong lumilipas  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Sa isip at panaginip  
Bawat pagpihit ng tadhana  
Hinahanap-hanap kita  
Hinahanap-hanap kita

Noon, iwanan mo ko  
Hinihintay kong marinig mo lang ang tinig ko  
Sa bawat tawag ng pangalan mo  
Binihag na bigat sa puso ko.  
  
Ngayon ika'y naririto  
At ang sabi mo'y ika'y akin mula ngayon  
Iwanan na sa limot ang noon  
O giliw ko, narito ako  
  
Chorus:  
Biglang ligaya ang naramdaman ng pusong  
Kay tagal nang naghintay sa'yo  
Ngunit ang dulot niyang sakit ay di malimot  
Ipagpawalanghanggan mo man  
Bulong ng puso ko ay Hindi na, ayoko na  
  
Puso mas malakas sa isip ko  
Tibok nito'y di patatalo  
  
O kay ligaya ko sana ngayong nand'rito  
Akin, akin ang pag-ibig mo  
Ngunit darating ang panahong di ko malimot  
Ipaliban mo na lang sa ibang pag-ibig mo pagkat  
Ayoko na, ayoko na  
  
Ngunit ang dulot niyang sakit ay di malimot  
Ipagpawalanghanggan mo man  
Sigaw ng puso ko ay  
Hindi na, ayoko na....

Hold me in your arms  
Regine velasquez  
  
The morning sunlight, moves gently on our bed  
Sounds of distant traffic, float into my head  
Eyes slowly open and words won't be enough  
But what is left unspoken burns softly in your touch  
  
Chorus  
So hold me in your arms  
Hold me in your arms  
So my love, hold me in your arms  
Time moves without us, this room will be untouched  
We're safe beneath the truth now  
Both safe within this love  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
And oh the heart in me  
Feels more than you can see  
I can't get close enough  
Every single day, is ours to feel this way  
I can't get close enough, never close enough ...  
  
Repeat chorus

Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
It sends the cold days from the sun  
The good time and fun  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
It sends your troubles for so long  
Wherever you are  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Ooh, ooh, oh  
Ahh  
Ahh  
  
Longing for the sun  
You will come on the island without me  
Longing for the sun  
We will come on the island  
Many miles away from home  
We will come on the island without me  
  
It sends you troubles for so long  
Wherever you are  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
  
Longing for the sun  
You will come to the island without me  
Longing for the sun  
We will come on the island  
Many miles away from home  
We will come on the island without me  
  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Let me take you far away  
You'd like a holiday  
Ooh  
Aah  
Ahh

All day I sit till dawn just thinkin' about your smile I see you in my dreams
how you complete me the flowers you left me here still wilt on the shelf by
the phone you took a part of me all the tears I've cried for you I'ts day by
day for me the only way I get by I keep talking in my sleep as if you will
stay right by my side baby...  
  
Chorus:  
How could you leave, and leave here with me all of the precious memories, just
left me behind and how my heart cries without you I'm so lost baby I still
can't believe that you could just leave standing alone the misery just left me
behind to find this... Come back baby  
  
I pray I call your name still wishing that you would come home...  
Nothing comforts me... But if you could hold me...  
My world would start to turn for a moment that things would be right  
Can you hear me?  
Baby don't you need me too?  
Are you afraid of me? Please tell me how love passed us by...  
Right now I'll do anything just to have you right back in my life...  
Baby...  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
All of the pain and the hurt trapped inside, keeps pulling me down and God
knows how I try...  
So hard when you love someone, the way that I love you...  
Please come back...  
We can talk it out loud the time and space my love away from you...  
  
It's day by day for me the only way I get by...  
I keep talking in my sleep as if you were still right by my side...  
Baby...

Chorus: Regine Velasquez...  
I can live... I can love

And touch the rainbow in the sky...  
I can be your good friend...  
I can love you... Until the end  
  
Mikee Cojuangco:

How lucky I am cause I am free...  
Free to do the things I wanna do...  
  
Donna Cruz:  
What took you so long to make me feel...  
I can give love...  
A love so real...  
What took you so long to let me know...  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Mikee, Donna, Regine:  
What took you so long to make me cry...  
So I would know the reason why...  
I'm so lucky I can smile... I didn't notice for a while...  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
I can dance... I can fly... And touch the rainbow in the sky...  
I can be your good friend...  
I can love you... Until the end...

I could stay awake just to hear you breathing,  
Watch you smile while you are sleeping,  
While you're far away and dreaming,  
I could spend my life in this sweet surrender,  
I could stay lost in this moment forever,  
When every moment spent with you is a moment I treasure.  
  
[Chorus]  
I Don't wanna close my eyes, I don't wanna fall asleep,  
Cause I'd miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing,  
Cause even when I dream of you, the sweetest dream would never do,  
I'd still miss you baby and I don't wanna miss a thing.  
  
Lying close to you, feeling your heart beating,  
And I wonder what you're dreamin', wonderin' if its me you're seeing,  
And then I kiss you're eyes and thank God were together,  
I just wanna stay with you in this moment forever, forever and ever  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't wanna miss one smile  
I don't wanna miss one kiss  
I just wanna be with you  
Right here with you, Just like this  
I just wanna hold you close  
And feel your heart so close to mine  
And just stay here in this moment for all the rest of time, yeah ah ah ah ah  
  
[Chorus: x3]

The days with you were endless summers  
The rains would come but we didn't seem to care  
Then before I knew  
I fell in love with you  
It felt so real, I wondered if you feel it too  
For many nights I stayed awake 'til morning  
Wond'ring how to ask if you cared  
Then to my surprise  
The love I had inside  
Was something that you didn't seem to share  
REFRAIN:  
I have to say goodbye  
Guess it's time to end it  
Say goodbye  
It's the only way  
Much as I want to cry  
There simply is no reason why  
It's hard for me  
But still I've got to try  
If love for you cannot be with me  
There's really nothing more to say  
Remember whoever may come to share my life  
You'll always have a special place inside  
(Repeat Refrain twice)  
I've got to try  
Woh ... Wooh ...  
Goodbye

I gotta take a little time, a little time to think things over  
I better read between the lines, in case I need it when I'm older  
Now this mountain I must climb, feels like the world upon my shoulders  
Through the clouds I see love shine, it keeps me warm as life grows colder  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far, to change this lonely life  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is, I know you can show me  
I'm gonna take a little time, a little time to look around me  
I've got nowhere left to hide, it looks like love has finally found me  
In my life there's been heartache and pain  
I don't know if I can face it again  
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far, to change this lonely life  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
I want to feel what love is, I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is, I want you to show me  
(And I wanna feel) I want to feel what love is  
(And I know) I know you can show me  
Let's talk about love - I want to know what love is  
The love that you feel inside - I want you to show me  
And I'm feeling so much love - I want to feel what love is  
No, you just can't hide - I know you can show me  
I want to know what love is (let's talk about love), I know you can show me  
I wanna feel it too - I want to feel what love is  
I wanna feel it too, and I know and I know - I know you can show me  
Show me love is real, yeah - I want to know what love is...  
(to fade)

Ikaw ang bigay ng maykapal  
Tugon sa aking dasal  
Upang sa lahat ng panahon  
Bawat pagkakataon  
Ang ibigin ay ikaw  
  
Ikaw ang tanglaw sa aking mundo  
Kabiyak nitong puso ko  
Wala ni kahati mang saglit  
Na sa iyo'why may papalit  
Ngayo't kailanma'why ikaw  
  
Ang lahat ng aking galaw  
Ang sanhi ay ikaw  
Kung may bukas mang tinatanaw  
Dahil may isang ikaw  
Kulang ang magpakailanpaman  
Upang bawat sandali ay  
Upang muli't muli ay  
Ang mahalin ay ikaw

You looked inside my fantasies  
And made each one come true  
Something no one else had ever found a way to do  
I've kept the memories one by one  
Since you took me in  
I know I'll never love this way again  
I know I'll never love this way again  
So I keep holding on before the good is gone  
I know I'll never love this way again  
Hold on, hold on, hold on  
A fool will lose tomorrow  
Reaching out for yesterday  
I won't turn my head in sorrow  
If you should go away  
I'll stand here and remember  
Just how good it's been  
And I know I'll never love this way again  
I know I'll never love this way again  
So I keep holding on before the good is gone  
I know I'll never love this way again  
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on  
I know I'll never love this way again  
So I keep holding on before the good is gone  
I know I'll never love this way again  
Hold on, hold on  
I know...  
Love...  
This way again

I'll never say goodbye  
Composed by: Willy Cruz  
Produced and Arranged by Mark J. Feist for the mjf Company  
Night after night we stay together  
Sharing moments that spell forever  
Day after day our love gets stronger  
Growing every minute as we get closer  
If we ever have to say goodbye  
And go our own separate ways  
I wouldn't know how to get by on my own  
After all the love and passion you have shown  
I'll never say goodbye  
No matter how they try  
To show me love  
That last if we're prisoners  
Caught in the past  
Don't let your tears run dry  
No need for you to cry  
I promise I will stay  
And with you all the way  
Our friends will soon forget  
That you and I once met  
As long as deep inside  
I know it's love not pride  
And I will never say  
Ever say goodbye  
I'll never say goodbye  
There are no reasons why  
Our souls are so entwined  
There is us, not you and I  
And time will soon regret  
Regretting we once met  
Because we'll show them all  
With love we can walk tall  
And we will never say  
Ever say goodbye  
I'll never say goodbye

It seems I've walked along this road before  
Past dreams and quite memories  
You know I've heard some of the sweetest sounds  
From voices that carry  
And they're calling you back to my arms  
And I'm holding back the tears  
They say that the road goes on forever  
But I'm going nowhere without you  
You left aboard the run away wind  
And left me standing all alone  
You travelled far and I travelled slow  
I turned around and you'd gone  
And I wish I was back in your arms  
Holding on to all our dreams  
And so the road might go on forever  
But I'm nowhere without you  
If you give a song that I'm now singing,  
Hold on to every word,  
Don't let the times we had slip through  
If you look you'll find that I'm still waiting for you,  
'Til they sing a sad sweet Chorus and the final curtain falls  
And I wish I was back in your arms  
Holding on to all our dreams  
You know that the road might go on forever  
But I'm nowhere without you  
Nowhere without you.

Just a gentle whisper  
Told me that you've gone  
Leaving only memories  
Where did we go wrong  
I couldn't find the words  
Then so let me say them now  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me that you care  
Tell me that you need me  
And I'll be there  
I'll be there waiting  
  
I will always love you  
I will always stay true  
There's no one who love  
You like I do  
  
Come to me now  
I will never leave you  
I will stay here with you  
Through the good and bad  
I will stand true  
I'm in love with you  
  
Now we're here together  
Yesterday has passed  
Life is just beginning, close to you at last  
And I promise to you  
I will always be there  
I give my all to you  
  
Living life without you is more than I can bear  
Hold me close forever  
I'll be there  
I'll be there for you  
  
Hold me closer  
Our love is forever  
Holding us together  
Nothing in this world can stop us now  
Love has found a way, love has found a way  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love  
Yes, I'm in love, so in love  
I'm in love with you

There's something in the air  
A feeling of danger  
There's something wrong with you  
I know I see it in your eyes  
Believe me when I say  
It's gonna be okay  
  
I told you from the start  
I won't be demanding  
If you have a change of heart  
I'll be understanding  
I only know just where I stand  
Or where I lie  
  
Believe me when I say  
We'll work it out some way  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else  
That your looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
I can tell by the way you lay your head  
In my shoulder  
Your hand is cold as ice, your hearts even  
Colder.  
  
It's tearing me up inside to think  
No matter how hard I try  
You may still walk away  
  
No matter what I do or say  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else  
That your looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye

I've been alone searching for love  
'til you came along and touched my heart  
With you in my life I'll never think twice  
It's you I've been waiting to call  
  
[Chorus:]  
Maybe it's you I'm thinking of  
Who'll mend this broken heart of mine  
It's you I'm wishing for who'll be with me tonight  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone who'll  
Make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my life  
Ohh...  
  
No lonely hours but just precious times  
I turn to you and I am alright  
Oh...  
Never will die this feeling inside  
With you every moment's forever  
  
Maybe it's you  
I'm thinking of who'll mend this broken heart of mine  
It's you I'm wishing for who'll be with me tonight  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone who'll  
Make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my live  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
Maybe it's you  
I'm thinking of who'll mend this broken heart of mine  
It's you I'm wishing for who'll be with me tonight  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone who'll make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my life  
  
Someone to hold, someone to cry, someone  
Who'll make me feel alive  
Maybe it's you all my life  
  
Ohhhh...  
Maybe it's you all my life

MAYBE NEXT YEAR  
  
When you turn on the radio  
You hear the cheerful sound  
Of Christmas carols old and new  
Sung out loud  
  
When you look around  
You can see the decors, Hanging bright  
People in panic but smiling  
Rushing around, laughing out loud  
  
It's not the best of times to say  
We're better off apart  
It's not the best of times to tell  
The people we both love  
That it's over  
That it's over  
  
CHORUS:  
But since this is the season of cheer  
We'll just brush away our tears  
And go on our way pretending  
That we're together still  
We'll tell tem tomorrow  
Or may be another day  
Maybe we won't have to say a single thing  
Maybe next year we'll say hello again  
Instead of goodbye

Always in your arms  
I have found a home  
Some where I would run to  
When I feel alone  
Always in your smile  
I have seen the sun  
That have cease to shine  
On everyone  
  
Maybe now maybe then  
I will surely find a friend  
Could it be that all this time  
It's you  
Maybe now maybe then life will  
Be the same again  
Take a look at me and you will see  
  
That more than words can say  
I still love you so  
Please give me the strength  
To somehow meant tonight

Bakit ba may lungkot sa 'yong mga mata  
Ako kaya'y di nais makapiling sinta  
Di mapapansin ako sayo'y may pagtingin  
Sana ang tinig ko'y iyong dinggin  
  
Ako ngayo'y di mapalagay  
Pagkat ang puso ko'y nalulumbay  
Sana ay pakaingatan mo ito  
At tandaan mo ang isang pangako  
  
Pangako hindi kita iiwan  
Pangakong di ko pababayaan  
Pangako hindi ka na mag-iisa  
Pangakong magmula ngayo'y tayong dalawa  
Ang magkasama  
  
Ano itong nadarama ko  
Ako kaya'y nahuhulog, umiibig na sayo  
Sa tuwing kasama ka'y anong ligaya  
Sana sa akin ay magtiwala  
  
Kung tunay man ang nadarama mo  
Mayron akong nais malaman mo  
Ang aking puso ay iyong-iyo  
Wag sanang lumimot sa pangako  
  
Pangako hindi kita iiwan  
Pangakong di ko pababayaan  
Pangako hindi ka na mag-iisa  
Pangakong magmula ngayo'y tayong dalawa  
  
Pangako hindi kita iiwan  
Pangakong di ko pababayaan  
Pangako hindi ka na mag-iisa  
Pangakong magmula ngayo'y tayong dalawa  
Ang magkasama  
Pangako

I.  
Sana'y di magmaliw ang dati kong araw  
Nang munti pang bata sa piling ni Nanay  
Nais kong maulit ang awit ni Inang mahal  
Awit nang pag-ibig habang ako'y nasa duyan  
(Repeat I)  
Ii.  
Sa aking pagtulog na labis ang himbing,  
Ang bantay ko'y tala, ang tanod ko'y bitwin,  
Sa piling ni Nanay langit ang buhay,  
Puso kong may dusa,  
Sabik sa ugoy ng duyan  
(Repeat I, ii)  
Coda:  
Nais kong matulog  
Sa dating duyan ko Inay  
O, Inay......

I have always dreamed of this day  
The whole world at my feet  
And fame within my reach  
Friends I have a plenty  
But when the lights down low  
And nowhere to go  
There's no one there but me  
  
Time flies and all things  
Must come to an end  
Like the sandcastles  
Slowly being swept away  
By the incoming tide  
All that is left are traces of what  
I used to be  
  
Today I have to let go  
And all will be forgotten  
But after everything's  
Been said and done  
And knowing that I once had  
You in my life  
And memories of what I used to be  
Are traces that will remind you of me

Say That You Love Me  
By: Regine Velasquez  
  
My morning starts to shine  
With teardrops in my eyes  
And here I am alone starting to realize  
That my days would be brighter  
If I could learn to hide  
The feeling that I have for you  
Keeps hurting me inside  
  
Then my days begin  
With simple thoughts of you  
Hoping that tomorrow will be me and you  
Sharing dreams with each other  
And making them come true  
Holding one another, saying all "I need is you"  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always be with you  
  
Now my nights would end  
With just one wish, that's you  
To hold me in the dark  
And help me make it through  
'Cause the pain that's inside me  
Would simply melt away  
If I had you here with me  
And promise me you'd stay  
  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always be with you  
Ooh, ooh, ooo  
  
Instrumental  
  
But will you  
But will you say that you love me  
And show me that you care  
Say when I need you  
You will always be there  
But if you go and leave me  
This I swear is true  
My love will always  
My love will always  
My love will always be with you  
  
My love will always be with you

We found each other  
But little did we know  
That in truth, my sisters  
Togetherness can make love grow  
We're always better together  
Than when we're apart  
We're sharing the same dreams in our hearts  
We're sharin'  
Sharin' the same dreams  
Yes! You and me  
And good things  
Good things will happen  
If we wait, wait and see  
We'll make it together  
Sink or swim  
And neither one of us will be  
Out on alimb  
We're sharin', sharin' the same dreams  
Yes! You and me  
We may be different  
But then that's who we are  
Just remember my sisters  
We're reachin' for that lucky star  
We share the same joy and laughter sadness and tears  
We're stayin' together for years and years.

She can kill with a smile  
She can wound in her eyes  
She can ruin your faith with her casual lies  
And she only reveals what she wants you to see  
She hides like a child  
But she's always a woman to me  
  
She can lead you to love  
She can take you or leave you  
She can ask for the truth  
But she'll never believe  
And she'll take what you've give her, as long as it's free  
Yeah, she steals like a thief  
But she's always a woman to me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh-- she takes care of herself  
She can wait if she wants  
She's ahead of her time  
Oh-- and she never gives out  
And she never gives in  
She just changes her mind  
  
And she'll promise you more  
Than just garden of eden  
Then she'll carelessly cut you  
And laugh while you're bleeding  
But she'll bring out the best  
And the worst you can be  
Blame it all on yourself  
Cause she's always a woman to me  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
She is frequently kind  
And then suddenly cruel  
She can do as she pleases  
She's nobody's fool  
And she can't be convicted  
She earned her degree  
And the most she will do  
Is throw shadows at you  
But she's always a woman to me...

Sino itong nasa salamin  
Kaharap ko ngunit 'di tumitingin  
S'ya ba'y nalulumbay at napapagod pa  
Sa pakikipaglaban at pagtitiis  
  
S'ya ba'y ako o ako ay sya  
Sadyang hindi ko makilala  
Nasa'n na ba ako sa yugtong ito  
Ako'y humihiling ng awa at pagmamahal  
  
'Di ko ninais na ako'y magka-ganito  
Ngunit kailangan kong hanapin ang tunay na ako  
  
Sino ako sa puso mo  
Sino ako sa buhay mo  
Hanggang kailan maghihintay  
Hanggang kailan mangangarap  
Na magpakailanman ay kasama ka  
  
'Di ko ninais na ako'y magka-ganito  
Ngunit kailangan kong hanapin ang tunay na ako  
  
Sino ako sa puso mo  
Sino ako sa buhay mo  
Hanggang kailan maghihintay  
Hanggang kailan mangangarap  
Na magpakailanman ay kasama ka  
  
Sino ako?

Long ago, and, oh so far away  
I fell in love with you  
Before the second show.  
Your guitar, it sounds so sweet and clear,  
But you're not really here.  
It's just the radio.  
Don't you remember you told me  
You loved me baby?  
You said you'd be coming back this way  
Again baby.  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, oh, baby.  
I love you, I really do.  
Loneliness is such a sad affair,  
And I can hardly wait  
To be with you again.  
What to say, to make you come again?  
Come back to me again,  
And play your sad guitar.

So far away on a cold, lonely night  
If I could only hear your voice,  
That, I?d be alright  
Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air  
Telephones are lonely  
Tell me you?re alright  
I just wanna feel you near  
When I lay down tonight.  
I?d give anything to see your face  
Just to share the silence of your eyes  
Your love is something no one can replace  
And While I?m gone I don?t want you to cry  
Please don?t cry.  
Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me you?re okay  
Telephones are lonely  
It sounds so far away  
Tell me that you need me  
Tell me it?s alright  
I just wanna hear your voice  
When I lay down tonight.  
I?d give everything to taste your kiss  
Just to feel your body touching mine  
It hurts me to be wanting you like this  
So tell me that you love me one more time  
One more time?  
Tell me that you love me  
Tell me you?re alone  
I just wanna hear your voice  
I?m so far from home  
Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air.  
Oh Tell me that you love me,  
Tell me that you care  
I just wanna hear your voice  
Come floating through the air  
Telephones are lonely  
Tell me you?re alright  
I just wanna feel you near  
When I lay down tonight.  
so far away...  

The long and winding road  
That leads to your door  
Will never disappear  
I've seen that road before  
It always leads me here  
Lead me to you door  
The wild and windy night  
That the rain washed away  
Has left a pool of tears  
Crying for the day  
Why leave me standing here  
Let me know the way  
Many times I've been alone  
And many times I've cried  
Any way you'll never know  
The many ways I've tried  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Don't leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door, oohoh  
But still they lead me back  
To the long winding road  
You left me standing here  
A long long time ago  
Don't leave me waiting here  
Lead me to your door
