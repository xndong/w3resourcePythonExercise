A night flight out to D.C.  
Phone rings with the news  
My God I'm so excited  
It's time to look for baby shoes(yes)  
Everyone says I'm glowing  
From a heart filled with joy  
To soon to be showing  
Is it a girl is it a boy  
  
[Chorus]  
Found out your My Darling Girl  
Don't you know you change my world  
Your my little doll so sweet  
You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child seeing you makes me smile  
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me  
  
Here's my favorite picture  
When you were 10 minutes old  
And we were right there with ya  
To wrap you up and keep you warm  
And now that your a little older  
I see your personality  
And every time that I hold ya  
I'm sure you'll know much more than me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause your My little Darling Girl  
Don't you know you change my world  
Your my little doll so sweet  
You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child seeing you makes me smile  
God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me  
  
And you were perfect from the first day  
They getting tired of hearing me say  
I'm not ashamed to stand up and tell  
The world that your my my my baby girl oh  
  
Ladadadadada  
Ladada dada dada dada  
Hanging tight with your mama  
Traveling round the globe  
  
Telling folks about Jesus  
And how he came to save their souls  
Obviously what's important(yeah)  
  
Gotta keep teaching you  
Gotta be your example  
That shows his life in all I do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are My Darling, Darling Girl

You nearly knock me off my feet  
Your my little darling child you know I love to see you smile and

Oh Yes God Bless the day he sent my little angel to me...

You go say something? Come on say something... yeah...

One day, I found a love  
Offering peace unto my soul  
I been so happy ever since that day  
Nothing but joy unspeakable  
  
And I know that it came from above  
And I'll let it show  
And I'll let it go  
Take it everywhere I go  
  
Day by day  
I'm going to keep Your spirit in my heart  
And even if the world grows cold  
I know Your love for me will never part

I remember the first time, you laughed with me  
And I remember the promises,  
You would never leave my side  
Now I'm standing with the news of a tragedy  
Standing here with a fragile heart,  
You see I never shed a tear  
I stayed strong for them, oh yes I did  
When everybody disappears  
It's only you who keeps me strong  
And I can't imagine going on  
Without you in my life,  
Going on with a fragile heart  
  
When I think about,think about life  
Lord I think of you  
I forget about everything else, there's only you and I  
And I can't think about ever giving up  
Can't give up the fight (no, no)  
The only thing that matters Lord, is you  
  
I ain't got no time to pretend  
That I'm not missing you, oh no no no no  
I know you're in good hands  
Same hands that hold my heart  
And I'll cherish every moment we spent  
As a gift from God above  
For he takes care of all the fragile hearts  
  
When I think about, think about life  
Lord I think of you, and I  
Forget about everything else  
There's only you and I  
I can't think about, ever, ever, ever giving up  
For the only thing that matters, when I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you  
  
You see my fragile heart's been broken  
And you're the only one who can put it all together again  
So I'm trusting you Lord to see me through  
  
There's only you and I  
I can't think about ever giving  
I can't give up(up a fight)  
The only thing that matters  
When I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart right back to you  
When I think about my life  
I,I,I,I forget about everything else  
Only you and I  
And I can't think about ever giving up  
Can't give up, No, no, no, no  
The only thing that matters when I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart back to you.  
  
When I think about my life, I forget about everything else  
Only you and I  
And I can't think about ever giving up  
Can't give up, can't give up  
For the only thing that matter's when I'm going through  
Is giving my fragile heart back to you.

They said you wouldn't make is so far uh uh  
And ever since they said it, it's been hard  
But never mind the nights you had to cry  
'Cause you have never let it go inside  
You worked real hard  
And you know exactly what you want and need  
So believe and you can never give up  
You can reach your goals  
Just talk to your soul and say  
  
[Chorus]  
I believe I can (I can)  
I believe I will (I will)  
I believe I know my dreams are real (know my dreams are real)  
I believe I'll chant (Oh yea)  
I believe I'll dance  
I believe I'll grow real soon and (That's why)  
That is what I do believe  
  
Your goals are just a thing in your soul uh uh  
And you know that your moves will let them show  
You keep creating pictures in your mind  
So just believe they will come true in time  
It will be fine  
Leave all of your cares and stress behind  
Just let it go  
Let the music flow inside  
Forget all your pain  
And just start to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Never mind what people say  
Hold your head high and turn away  
With all our hopes and dreams  
I will believe  
Even though it seems it's not for me  
I won't give up I'll keep it up  
Look into the sky  
I will achieve all my needs  
I will always believe  
  
[Repeat x2]

I say a prayer every night  
Whatever I do, I'll get it right  
With no regret, no guilt or shame this time (no not this time)  
Once I surrender, I won't dare look back  
'Cause if I do, I'll get off track  
Move ahead in faith  
And patiently await your answer  
What will it be  
  
Sight beyond what I see

Prepare my mind, prepare my heart  
For whatever comes, I'm gone' be ready  
Strength to pass any test

With you in control, I can't go wrong  
'Cause I always know

Lost everything, but I still had you  
You showed me your grace  
Now my life's renewed and I thank you (yes... I thank you)  
So I'll tell anyone who'll listen, I'll testify  
About how good you were to me when so call friends passed me by  
The fact that you would show somebody so broke down  
So much mercy...  
  
Sight beyond what I see  
You know what's best for me  
Prepare my mind, prepare my heart  
For whatever comes, I'm gonna be ready  
Strength to pass any test

And I'll give my love as a tribute to how great you are...

[Chorus to end]

I've come through many hard trials  
Through temptations on every hand  
Though Satan's tried to stop me  
And to place my feet on sinking sand  
Through the pain and all of my sorrows  
Through the tears and all my fears  
The Lord was there to keep me  
For He's kept me in the midst of it all  
  
Not because I've been so faithful  
Not because I've always obeyed  
No it's not because I trusted Him  
To be with me all of the way  
But it's because He loves me so dearly  
He was there to answer my calls  
He was there always to protect me  
For He's kept me in the midst of it all  
  
I've come through many hard trials  
Through temptations on every hand  
Though Satan's tried to stop me  
And to place my feet on sinking sand  
But Jesus loves me dearly  
He was there to answer my calls  
He was there always to protect me  
For He's kept me in the midst of it all  
For He's kept me in the midst of it all  
  
No He's never left me  
And He's never let me fall  
Oh yes He will protect you  
For He's kept me in the midst of it all  
For He's kept me in the midst of it all  
  
Yes He's kept me  
Yes Jesus kept me  
Yes Jesus kept me  
  
Jesus kept me  
Jesus kept me  
Jesus kept me  
In the midst of it all yea yes  
In the midst of it all yea yes  
  
Yes He did

I know that there are times in your life  
When the wheels just seem to turn  
And uncertainties about your tomorrow seem to grow  
One thing you should remember  
And you should always know  
Out of everyone who loves you  
I love you the most  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear every word you say  
When you cry at night  
I'll wipe the tears away  
Just pray, my love  
And I'll be there right away  
You will never have to wonder about My love  
Just put your faith and trust in My care  
I will always be there to hold you in my arms  
When you're afraid don't worry  
I'll protect you from the storm  
Out of everyone who loves you  
I love you the most  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear  
I am just a prayer away  
Call My name with your heart  
And I'll hear  
I am just a prayer away  
Call my name with your heart  
And I'll hear every word you say  
When you cry at night  
I'll wipe the tears away  
Just pray my love  
And I'll be there right away

Raise my voice in testimony  
Cause he's more than a friend to me  
Gave my heart 'cause I believe he's the almighty  
I can look at my life and see all the things that  
He's done to set me free protecting me from harm  
Raise my hands to show how I feel  
His presence is oh so real  
Till he's guiding me I'll be still  
Cause I'd be lost without him  
My heart and soul I dedicate and to show I appreciate his love  
I'll give him praise  
  
[Chorus]  
Lift Him up  
Each and everyday we celebrate our faith  
(Lift Him Up)  
In a song of praise thanking him for everything (Lift Him up)  
Devotion I express because I know I'm blessed (Lift Him up)  
Praise Him with every breath  
Glorify His name, lift Him up  
  
Use the temple He gave us  
Do a joyful dance of worship  
Cause His mercy is so precious and new every morning  
Always let Him know that we're grateful for another chance to say thank you  
'Round the world sing it louder, for our heavenly father  
To his almighty power  
Let's glorify him, magnify him  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
You created the earth and the heavens above  
And for our salvation you gave your own son  
So we humble ourselves to your infinite power  
Your love is greater than mine  
(Your grace) and your grace is amazing  
And through us we lift your holy name  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Since the last time I saw you  
God has moved another mountain out of my way  
Led me to green pasture turned my midnight into day  
Placed my feet up on a rock to stay  
  
Since the last time I saw you  
God has calmed another raging storm in my life  
Led me into safety turned my darkness into light  
Now I stand in the power of his might  
  
You would have thought that God already done enough for me  
When he took my place at Calvary  
But he done so much more and more  
Right before my eye's  
And I have no other choice  
But to stand and testify, stand and testify  
  
Since the last time I saw you  
God has worked another wondrous miracle for me  
Led me into triumph  
Now my blinded eyes can see that Christ the lord  
Performs victoriously  
  
You would have thought that he done enough for me  
When he took my place at Calvary  
But he's done more and more and more every day  
He makes a way and he's made a way  
  
Since the last time I saw you things have changed  
I'm not the same since the last time  

Hold on and don't give up  
Don't you worry  
You don't have to cry  
Cause He He sees what you're going through  
Yes Yes he does  
God is willing and He is able  
This did not catch him by surprise  
So just trust him  
And just oh step aside  
Be still and don't question it  
These obstacles they were allowed  
He wants to take you higher and higher  
If you will hold on  
God is willing and more than able  
This did not catch him by surprise  
So just trust him  
And just step aside  
Oh I know he's faithful  
My God is faithful  
To do what He said He'll do  
Now if He said just believe it  
There's nothing he can't do  
You must stand on His word (stand on His word)  
Put all your cares on him (give them to Him)  
Cause He knows and He loves you  
He did it for me that why I can say  
Step step aside  
God can work a miracle for you  
Step aside  
You got to let go  
And let God  
And let go and let God be God  
Move yourself out of the way  
Move your pride out of the way  
He'll never leave you  
Nor forsake you  
This what I know it ain't just what I heard  
So Thank You Lord for being awesome to me  
You're marvelous  
Praise him Praise Him  
Oh step aside  
Let go let go let go  
He knows what you go through  
He knows what you can bear  
He can do what you can't do  
So step so step so step aside  
Thank you Lord  
And you're in control  
So I step aside  

Take away any desire in me that hurts you  
Take away anything that stands between you and me  
I want to be what you created me to be  
It's my desire that you find favor in me  
Lord  
Take away anything that displeases you  
  
Take away any evil thought within me  
Take away anything that proves to break your heart  
I want to be in sweet communion with you  
It's my desire to do everything you want me to do  
Lord  
Take away anything that displeases you  
  
Remove all doubt  
All insecurity  
Erase all hate  
All iniquity  
Discard all the fear  
Found deep within me  
Lord  
Take away anything that displeases you  
  
Take away lord  
Take away  
  
Take away any desire in me that hurts you  
Take it away  

There is a name that is so precious,  
a name so wonderful to me.  
This name is worthy of all praises.  
Because of him, I am made free.  
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him.  
The one who gave, his life for me.  
Because of love, so unconditional,  
I will have life, eternally.

This name speaks calm, unto me fears.  
And when I feel, that no one loves me.  
His loving presence is so near.

The one who gave, his life for me.  
Because of love, so unconditional,  
I will have life, eternally.

To find a place, my soul will soar.  
And finally see, the face of Jesus.  
And praise his name, forevermore!  
That name is Jesus, oh how I love him!  
The one who gave, his life for me!  
Because of love, so unconditional,
