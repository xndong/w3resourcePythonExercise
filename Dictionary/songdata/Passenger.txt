One went out at a bus-stop in Edinburgh  
One went out in an English park  
One went out in a night club, when I was fifteen  
Little lights in my heart  
  
One went out when I lied to my mother  
Said the cigarettes she found were not mine  
One went out within me  
Now I smoke like a chimney  
It's getting dark in this heart of mine  
It's getting dark in this heart of mine  
  
We're born with millions  
Of little lights shining in the dark  
And they show us the way  
One lights up, every time you feel love in your heart  
One dies when it moves away  
  
One went out in the back streets of Manchester  
One went out in an airport in Spain  
One went out, have no doubt  
When I grew up and moved out  
Of the place where the boy used to play  
  
One went out when uncle Ben got his tumor  
We used to fish and I fish no more  
Though we will not return  
I know one still burns  
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore  
On a fishing boat of the New Jersey Shore  
  
We're born with millions  
Of little lights shining in the dark  
And they show us the way  
One lights up every time we feel love in our hearts  
One dies when it moves away  
  
We're born with millions  
Of little lights shining in our hearts  
And they die along the way  
Till we're old and we're cold  
And we're lying in the dark  
'Cause they'll all burn out one day  
They'll all burn out one day  
Oh oh, they'll all burn out one day  
They'll all burn out one day  
Yeah, no

Trying to hold a love that wants to go  
Is like trying to catch a falling flake of snow  
It glimmers while it can but it will melt between your hands, you know  
To keep alive a love that wants to die  
You teach the birds to swim, and all the fish to fly  
But gills are made for water, and feathers for the sky, y'know  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)  
  
To find a love that's new where do you start?  
It's like trying to find the light switch in the dark  
But falling over mess you left unaddressed inside your heart  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x2)  
  
But I will find love, that's a blind love  
It's the kind of love I need  
Oh well I'll find love, that's a blind love  
It's the kind of love I need  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh (x4)

Well we dance without our shoes,  
But there's glass around our feet  
And we'd walk around the town,  
But we're allergic to concrete  
We'd be stuffed to the gills  
But there's nothing here to eat  
No, there's nothing here to eat  
No, there's nothing here to eat  
  
Oh, well we'd love to rest our eyes  
But we hear the floor boards creek  
So, we lie with one eye open and  
Clutch knives between the sheets  
If there's no rest for the wicked  
Well, then we'll never get no sleep  
We'll never get no sleep  
No, we'll never get no sleep  
Oh, no...  
  
'Cause we're banging our head's against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our head's are soft  
It's a painful way to get attention  
It's a painful way to get attention  
  
We're banging our head's against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our head's are soft  
It's a painful way to get attention  
It's a painful way to get attention  
  
We're banging our head's against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our head's are soft  
It's a painful way to get attention  
It's a painful way to get attention  
  
We're banging our head's against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our head's are soft  
It's a painful way to get attention  
It's a painful way to get attention  
  
We're banging our head's against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our head's are soft  
It's a painful way to get attention  
It's a painful way to get attention  
  
We're banging our head's against brick walls  
And the walls are hard and our head's are soft  
It's a painful way to get attention  
It's a painful way to get attention, no

What would you sacrifice for reality?  
Is it important what we used to be?  
  
Looks like I got here first  
Offer a king and I'll invite you in  
Spend carnival money  
Because tomorrow won't be as sunny  
  
Praise you  
I can't change you  
When I try to  
  
Above it all  
We end up somewhere  
If we're equal  
We could go far  
Dim the lights  
We're everything  
The day we try to bend it  
(We fall) like any other star  
  
Would you save this moment for another day?  
If you're told maybe and that's all the say  
  
Cross the waters to the silent  
Focus on love  
A golden dove  
Wake up (to) a new day  
Lets climb to the top

Sick of begging  
Sick of trying to please  
Sick of the struggle  
Sick of your fake id  
  
If I ever feel your scent again  
you're one fist to close  
  
If I ever see your shadow again  
you're going down the hard way  
They call me the comedy clown  
They feed me waste in the gutter  
They call me the comedy clown  
I am waste in the gutter  
  
If I ever see you again  
I'll be close to my grave  
If I ever lie to you again  
I'll be dirt

Fear is dark but my love is a lantern  
Shining up like coins in a fountain  
Hope is a tree sitting on a mountain where the grass don't grow  
There's a sad old sea but my love is an island  
Wild and free like the hills in the highlands  
Hope is a breeze that brings me back to dry land  
Where the flowers grow  
  
Love is a baby born  
Love is the last unicorn  
Love is the only song i'll sing  
  
Hate is a poison  
Love is a remedy  
Singing out like the sweetest of melodies  
Hope is a ghost in the deepest of memories  
Stronger than ten of me  
Fear is the enemy  
In the dark and it creeps like a shark  
In the coldest sea  
In the deepest part but  
Hope is the beat in the oldest heart  
A hand in a hand and a brand new start  
  
Love is a fireside  
Warm on the coldest of nights  
Love is the only song I'll sing  
Love is the truest of words  
Love is the last winter birds  
Love is the only song I'll sing  
  
Oh I'll sing  
Til I can't sing no more  
Oh I'll sing  
Til my throat is sore

Well the sky's turning purple  
Above the community centre  
And I'm sitting in a circle,  
Telling my secrets to strangers  
And they say I've got a problem  
But I don't know that I've got one  
'Cause you never know that you've got one  
'Til someone comes along and spots one  
  
They say it's the hardest step  
But it's the first one of many  
And my feet are stuck to the ground  
And I can't seem to take any  
I could tell them I just came  
For the free cup of tea and the biscut  
And make my way towards the door  
But I don't think I can risk it  
  
'Cause I never wanted to stay,  
But the morning came so soon  
And we all know the words,  
But we just sing them out of tune  
  
'Cause I had my first drink when I was fourteen,  
And I knew that I was in trouble  
'Cause I woke up the next morning  
With my face down in the rubble  
And everyone was drinking singles  
I pour myself a double,  
I just needed a little bit more  
  
And now I'm sitting here with my name badge  
And I'm listening to the same sad stories  
About their old dads,  
Who're making all the same  
Bad turning's at their crossroads  
And drowning all their sorrows,  
Without any lifeguard around  
  
Oh no, I never wanted to stay  
But the morning came so soon  
And oh, we all know the words  
But we just sing them out of tune  
And oh, oh no  
  
And the sky's turning dark  
So we step out into the car-park  
And I see you all same place, same time next week  
But before we go our separate ways  
There's just one thing I'd like to say is,  
Anybody up for a drink

Hey, see you soon  
Sail through your room  
I'll meet you there  
  
Hey, be my friend  
Stay 'til the end  
Don't walk away  
Hey, hey, hey-hey  
  
Hey, take them off  
Don't talk that way  
Don't hear my lover say  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
Chains, move that thing  
Chains, we don't see  
My chain's way too long  
Chains  
  
Chains, move that thing  
Chains, we don't see  
Chains are way too long  
And hear my song  
Hear my song

Wind-screen wiper's never gonna stop,  
Never stop wiping all the snow from the top of our car,  
A car that has traveled so far from our homes,  
It's never good to feel alone  
  
But we've got what we've got  
It's friends that we've got in a car,  
A car that has traveled so far from our homes,  
It never feels good to be alone  
  
You're in the headlights,  
Skidding out into the road  
Like a deer, scared and covered in snow  
Oh, you're in the headlights,  
Skidding out into the road  
Like a deer, scared and covered in snow  
  
Flakes, they fall on boxes and tins and cans  
The tins and the cans that fall from bins and hands  
And our hands we hold in such a hurry in a world,  
  
That doesn't seem to care about  
Themselves or each other  
Or themselves or each other,  
Or sisters or mothers,  
Or themselves or each other,  
Or architects or brothers,  
Or themselves or each other,  
Or astronauts or fathers,  
Or themselves or each other,  
Or themselves  
  
So, kiss me here beneath the street lights  
In a lay-by, all covered in snow oh!  
Yeah, kiss me here beneath the street lights  
And oh, in a lay-by, all covered in snow for now  
  
You and I, we've always been crows,  
Hiding black wings beneath the snow  
You and I, we've always been crows,  
Hiding yellow feet beneath the snow  
  
You're in the headlights, darling oh!  
And you're flying out over the road, no, no  
And you're covered in snow  
And oh, you're in the headlights, darling now  
You're flying out over the road  
And you're covered in snow

Looking at pictures,  
On Facebook.  
Of your ex-girlfriend,  
At three in the morning.  
  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped.  
  
Getting so drunk,  
You fall over.  
Singing up at lamp-posts,  
At two in the morning.  
  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped.  
  
'Cause it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.  
Oh, it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.  
  
Going to parties.  
With friends  
Who are friends of friends.  
At one in the morning.  
  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped anyone,  
Never helped.

Drinking everything in sight.

Never helped.  
  
Oh, it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.  
Oh, it's so pure,  
You can hardly taste it.

When the party's over.  
And all your friends  
Are going home with their girlfriends to their dog or beds.  
  
Yeah, just hold on,  
When the party's over.  
And you can't help the world's spinning.  
'Cause heartbreak goes  
Straight to your head.

I know a man with nothing in his hands, nothing but a rolling stone  
He told me about when his house burnt down, he lost everything he owned  
He lay asleep for six hole weeks, they were gonna ask his mother to choose  
When he woke up with nothing he said I'll tell you something  
When you've got nothing, you've got nothing to lose  
Now I've got a hole in my pocket, a hole in my shirt, a whole lot of trouble,
he said  
But now the money's gone, life carries on and I miss it like a hole in the
head  
  
I know a woman with kids around her ankles an a baby on her lap  
She said one day her husband went to get a paper and the mother fucker never
came back  
Mortgage to pay and four kids to raise, keeping the wolf from the door  
She said the wolf's just a puppy and the door's double locked so why you
gottaworry me for  
Now he left a hole in my heart a hole in a promise a hole on the side of my
bed  
Oh but now that he's gone well life carries on and I miss him like a hole in
the head  
  
Well sometimes you can't change and you can't choose  
And sometimes it seems you gain less than you lose  
Now we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives  
Well we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on  
  
Well we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives  
Well we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on  
Said we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives  
Well we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on  
  
Said we've got holes in our hearts, we've got holes in our lives  
We've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on  
  
Said we've got holes in our hearts, we've got holes in our lives  
We've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on  
Said we've got holes in our hearts, yeah we've got holes in our lives  
Well we've got holes, we've got holes but we carry on.

The tower I've been  
A brick I am  
A statue so grand  
I feed your sun  
But I never thought  
That I would be burned like this  
  
Your rays of evil licking my skin  
So hear my prayer now  
Teach me to win  
Or I'll be gone  
  
Blinded by false innocence  
Steal my wings  
And I die slowly  
Cracked smile, deceivable eyes  
I'm burned by the wind  
And I die slowly  
  
These days I'm dirt  
Bring the rain  
Because I am the desert  
I feed your sun but I never thought  
I'll be burned like this

I hate racist blokes, telling tasteless jokes  
And explaining where people belong  
I hate ignorant folks, who pay money to see gigs  
And talk through every fucking song  
I hate people in night clubs, snorting coke  
And explaining where your going wrong  
Well if you agree, then come hating with me  
And feel free to sing along  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Wonderful, love it  
  
Well I hate pointless status updates on Facebook  
Fyi we were never "m8"s  
We pretend to be friends on the internet  
When in real life, we have nothing to say  
To each other, oh brother I have love for my mother  
For good times, for music and my mates  
Yeah I laugh, and live and I have love to give  
But sometimes all you can do is hate  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
Well I hate them fussy eaters, you cook them fajitas  
They only eat pizza and chips  
I hate stepping outside, for a smoke and some guy  
Coughs, like your lungs are his  
And I hate queuing up, for festival toilets  
Especially when you need to shit  
And I hate the X-Factor, for murdering music  
You bunch of money grubbing pricks  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
And I hate them magazines, aimed at insecure teens  
That make ten year old's race to grow up  
Hey kids, let's all be anorexic or better  
Eat chocolate until you throw up  
Keep your Hollywood stars, and their stupid cars  
And the Bo-tox, that makes them look fucked  
Just grow old with grace, have you seen Cher's face  
It looks like it's been hit by a truck  
  
And it goes:  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
One more time, loud as you can  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la

Well if love is blind,  
Then home's where the heart is  
How we ever gonna get back where we started  
From now on, run with blindfolds  
Into the woods till the trees knock us out cold  
Winds shriek like drunken females  
On a hen night, last bit of fun,  
Till he breaks her heart in a text or an email  
She can deal with the bastard son  
  
We've got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road  
We see a light in the dark but it's fading like hope  
I'll make a promise just to break it for the sake of it  
We think that we're honest but truth is what we make it to be  
  
Well a stitch in time saves nine, that's fine  
But we've all been proper stitched up this time  
It's a right old mess at a grand old time  
Right and left, in front and behind  
It's Sunday, Sunday, another bloody Sunday  
Just a day till another bloody Monday  
Morning, yawning, boring, snoring  
In front of the boss when you just got a warning  
  
We've got a knife in our hearts and a fork in the road  
We see a light in the dark but it's fading like hope  
I'll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me  
Just so there's someone else to blame when it all falls down  
When it all falls down, down, down  
When it all falls down, down  
  
So let's get some fire in our hearts,  
And a yellow brick road  
I'm getting bored of the dark,  
We could turn the lights on, you know  
I'll make a promise and I'll keep it for the sake of it  
We could tell the truth for once, see just how we take to it  
We could walk in forests and climb up every tree  
We'll build our house upon the sand, every day in the sea  
I'll fall in love with you and love, you can fall in love with me  
Just so there's somebody else  
Just so there's somebody else  
Just so there's somebody else

I'm lost and confused  
I'm stuck in your favorite parade  
I'm choking, I feel strangled  
I can't get a feeling  
Is this a game?  
I'm begging  
But you won't please me  
How come I bleed for this illusion  
I've been falling for so long now  
Will I ever see that this isn't real?  
  
Then it all comes into the frame  
The struggle it just isn't worth it  
We think we are the originality  
We overdo it and become just the same  
  
I'm waiting for a break  
So for it seemed to be out of reach  
  
But today I'm god like  
Stay away cause its my time to play  
The revenge feel my wrath  
Stay away because I'm back  
I'll join the elite

Well last night I couldn't sleep  
I got up and started walking  
Down to the end of my street  
And on into town  
Well I had no one to meet  
And I had no taste for talking  
Seems I'm talking my whole life  
It's time I listen now  
  
Well I walk past the late night boys  
With their bottles in their doorways  
And I walk past the business men  
Sleeping like babies in their cars  
And I thought to myself oh, son  
You may be lost in more ways than one  
But I have a feeling that it's more fun  
Than knowing exactly where you are  
  
Like a stone carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Well I keep on walking  
Oh, I keep on walking  
Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love, comes to finds me  
  
Well I walked into the morning  
And felt that warm sunlight forming on my shoulders  
'Cause it hit me with no warning  
Like a summer sky storming in my lungs  
Ain't it funny how the kids walk by  
They'll do anything to make themselves look older  
While the women spend their money  
On anything that makes them look young  
  
Like a stone carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Oh, I keep on walking  
Oh, I keep on walking  
'Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love, comes to finds me  
  
Oh, lo, no  
Oh, oh, oh, no  
Oh, lo, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Well I'm like a stone,  
And I'm carried on the river  
Like a boat sailing on the sea  
Oh, well I keep on walking  
Oh, well I keep on walking  
'Till I fine that old love  
Or that old love, comes to finds me

I see you nearly everyday.  
I see you, but you don't see me.  
I wish I had something clever to say.  
And I wish I had something better I could be.  
  
We touched hands by the coffee machine the other day.  
I know you've forgotten already,  
But I'm gonna take that moment to the grave.  
To the grave.  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home.  
I just wanna walk you home.  
Oh, yea.  
  
I see you nearly every night.  
I see you when you're down in your house.  
With my night vision binoculars  
I creep quiet as a mouse.  
  
And I get jealous when I see you stroking his hair.  
But it's okay, I tell myself 'cause I know  
It's only I'm not there.  
I'm not there.  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home.  
I just wanna walk you home.  
Well I just need some time alone.  
I just need some time alone.  
  
I'm the boy who watches the phone.  
I'm the boy who eats lunch on his own.  
I'm the boy with the monotone.  
I'm the boy who still lives at home.  
  
I'm the boy with the ironed shirt.  
I'm the boy who watches you work.  
I know where you keep your skirts.  
I know where your secrets lurk.  
  
I'm the boy that's calling your house.  
I'm the boy that's freaking you out.  
With my thermal flask of tea.  
Up there in your neighbor's tree.  
  
I'm the boy that's crossing borders.  
I'm the boy with social disorders.  
I'm the boy with restraining orders.  
I'm the boy, yeah.  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home.  
I just wanna walk you home.  
And I know that's it not right to creep.  
But I just wanna watch you sleep alone.  
  
Cuz I just wanna walk you home.  
I just wanna walk you home.

Well, I met him in Minnesota,  
He was dark and overcast.  
With long, grey hair and eyes that stared  
Through me like I was glass.  
I asked "Where are you going to?"  
He said, "I'm the wind I'm just blowing through."  
He lit up a cigarette and began to talk.  
  
Said:  
"The doctors told me that my body won't hold me,  
My lungs are turning black.  
Been lucky strikes four since I was at school now there ain't no turning  
Back.  
They can't tell me how long I've got,  
Maybe months but maybe not,  
So I'm taking this bike and riding to New York.  
  
'Cause I wanna see my grand-daughter one last time,  
Wanna hold her close and feel her tiny  
Heart beat next to mine.  
Wanna see my son and the man he's become,  
Tell him I'm sorry for the things I've done,  
And I'd do it if I had to walk.  
Oh, I'm taking this bike and riding to New York  
  
Through the forests of West Constant  
That I knew as a boy,  
Past the sky line of Chicago,  
Round the lakes of Illinois  
I lay my head in a motel bed where my back gets sore and my eyes turn red,  
Listen to the trucks roll past my door.  
Through the fields of Ohio as the sunshine paints them gold.  
I run just like a river runs, rapid, quick and cold.  
And fly through Pennsylvania and the Jersey turn piked holes.  
And I won't stop 'till I get to New York.  
  
'Cause I wanna see my grand-son one last time.  
I wanna see his eyes sparkling ans stare back into mine.  
Now my time is short,  
I wanna see my daughter,  
Tell her all the things that I should have taught her  
And I'd do it if I had to walk.  
Oh, I'm taking this bike and riding to New York.  
  
And I'd go up to the churchyard one last time,  
Lay flowers down for the woman who gave me the best years of my life,  
And I'd do it if I had to walk.  
Yeah, I'd do it if I had to walk.  
I'm taking this bike and riding to New York. "

Tobacco stains our yellow teeth  
And all our fingers and underneath  
Our fingernails, that clasp on sheets  
As we try desperately to sleep  
  
Hearts are sad and eyes are tired  
And all this Red Bull keeps us wired  
Gives us wings  
It gives us rings around our eyes  
  
We put three sugars in our tea  
Sit to watch too much day time TV  
And laugh at mums  
Who don't know who the father is  
  
And all our girlfriends are long gone  
We watch too much internet porn  
Who needs love  
When you've got silicone and strap ons  
  
And beer bloats our spoiled guts  
And shit jobs keep us in ruts  
And keep us eying up  
The what's and ifs and buts and maybes  
  
And falling over in the street  
Is just a part of every week  
And we lie drunkenly  
Just staring at the stars  
  
Remember when they were in reach  
And all the teachers used to teach  
You can do anything  
If you put your mind to it  
  
We put our minds to it all  
But disappointment crashed the ball  
We could have done anything  
But we just never quite knew it  
  
So tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
Tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
  
And tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
And tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
  
Oh oh, so tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night  
And tie your scarf on tight  
It's to be a cold night

Hey I'm a fish out of water  
A lamb to the slaughter  
A moth to the flame  
Hey I'm just a bird on a wire  
Just a coal in the fire  
Just a face and a name  
  
Hey I go chasing thunder  
Go dancing under  
Go falling free  
Hey I go running in circles  
Like baby turtles  
Down to the sea  
Down to the sea  
  
Hey I'm just rust to a handle  
I'm breeze to a candle  
I'm a choice you can't choose  
Hey I'm just a little bit later  
I'm yesterdays paper  
I'm yesterdays news  
  
Hey I go chasing thunder  
Go dancing under  
Go falling free  
Hey I go running in circles  
Like baby turtles  
Down to the sea  
Down to the sea  
  
Morning sun keep on shining  
Trees they're climbing  
Tall and free  
Searching but never finding  
Rivers winding to the sea

Light up my lantern, I'll cut you a path,  
We've walked for hours and it's getting dark  
We left the roadside in search of aid,  
Wind-screen shattered and tire marks made  
  
I've never seen someone bleeding like this,  
Rip off your sleeve and clench your wrist  
  
I'll light the stove and sit by the hearth,  
Orangey glow light the wintry dark  
We kept her bedroom exactly the same,  
Winters they followed and Summers they came  
  
He'd bash around, banging down on the floor  
I sit alone with an eye on the door  
  
Stop in this clearing, we'll stay here tonight  
Press up against me, I'll hold you so tight  
I got these matches, we'll let off some smoke  
Maybe they'll see us and maybe they won't  
Blanket of leaves hide the light from the stars,  
I'll lie awake listening out for cars  
  
He stares through curtains when he talks to the night,  
I sit and listen for tires on the drive  
I keep on waiting and he keeps on talking  
Just stop him talking, please stop him talking  
  
No, give me silence  
Give me silence,  
Give me silence  
Oh, no...

We used to never say never  
Used to think we'd live forever  
Flying free beneath the sun  
  
Days go running and hiding  
The weeks go slipping and sliding  
Years leave quicker every time they come  
Remember when we were young  
  
Look back to the best of days  
Collecting our yesterdays  
As they build up one by one  
  
Oh how we beg and we borrow  
Say we'll do it tomorrow  
But tomorrow never seems to come  
  
We used to never say never  
Used to think we'd live forever  
Flying free beneath the sun  
  
Days go running and hiding  
The weeks go slipping and sliding  
Years leave quicker every time they come  
Remember when we were young  
  
And we were boys on the beach  
Everything was in reach  
I know it's hard to remember  
  
But oh how the years they vanish  
I always wanted to learn Spanish  
And travel 'round South America  
  
We used to never say never  
Used to think we'd live forever  
Flying free beneath the sun  
  
Days go running and hiding  
The weeks go slipping and sliding  
Years leave quicker every time they come  
  
Remember when we were young [x3]

Well, I've got open eyes,  
And an open door,  
But I don't know what I'm searching for.  
I should know by now.  
  
Well, I've a big old heart,  
This I know for sure,  
But I don't know what my love is for.  
I should know by now.  
  
Well, I'll wait in line,  
So I can wait some more,  
'Till I can't remember what I came here for,  
But I can't leave now,  
Cause I've a light that shines,  
And a love so pure,  
But I don't know what to use them for.  
I should know by now.  
  
Well I spent my money,  
I lost my friends,  
I broke my mobile phone,  
3am and I'm drunk as hell,  
And I'm dancing on my own,  
Taxi-cabs ain't stopping, and I don't know my way home.  
  
Well it's hard to find a reason, when all you have is doubts,  
Hard to see inside yourself when can't see your way out,  
Hard to find an answer when the question won't come out.  
  
Oh everyone's filling me up with noise,  
I don't know what they're talking about,  
Everyone's filling me up with noise,  
I don't know what they're talking about,  
Everyone's filling me up with noise,  
I don't know what they're talking about,  
  
You see all I need's a whisper in a world that only shouts.
