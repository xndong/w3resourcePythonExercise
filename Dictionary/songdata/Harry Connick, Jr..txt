In every job that must be done  
There is an element of fun  
You find the fun and snap  
The job's a game  
In every task you undertake  
Becomes a piece of cake  
A lark, a spree  
It's very clear to see  
That a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
A robin feathering his nest  
Has very little time to rest  
While gathering his  
Bits of twine and twig  
Though quite intent in his pursuit  
He has a merry tune to toot  
He knows a song  
Will move the job along  
For a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
The honeybees that brings the nectar  
From the flowers to the comb  
Never tire ever buzzing to and fro, no  
Because they take a little nip  
From every flower that they sip  
And hence they find  
Their task is not a grind  
For a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
The medicine go down  
Medicine go down  
Just a spoonful of sugar  
Helps the medicine go down  
In a most delightful way  
In a most delightful way  

I remember the days, of just keeping time  
Of hanging around in sleepy towns, forever  
Back roads empty for miles  
  
Well you can't have a dream and cut it to fit  
But when I saw you I knew, we'd go together  
Like a wink and a smile  
  
Leave your old jalopy  
Buy the railroad track  
We'll get a hip, double dip, tip toppy  
Two seat Pontiac  
  
So you can rev her up, don't go slow  
It's only green lights and alright  
Let's go together with a wink and a smile  
  
Give me a wink and a smile  
We go together like a wink and a smile  
  
Now my heart is music, such a simple song  
Sing it again the notes never end  
This is where I belong  
  
Just the sound of your voice  
The light in your eyes  
We're so far away from yesterday  
Together, with a wink and a smile  
  
We go together like a wink and a smile

Got my tweed pressed  
Got my best vest  
  
All I need now is the girl  
Got my striped tie  
Got my hopes high  
Oh, I've got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I need's the girl to go with 'em  
If she'll just appear  
We'll take this big town for a whirl  
And if she'll say  
"My darling, I'm yours," I'll throw away  
My striped tie and my best pressed tweed  
All I really need is the girl  
  
'Look out now.  
You all didn't know I could do that, did you?  
You still don't know I can do that, do you?'  
  
Oh, I've got the time and the place and the rhythm  
All I need's the girl to go with 'em  
If she'll just appear  
We'll, we'll take this big town for a whirl  
And if she'll say  
"Oh Harry, I love ya,"  
Then I'll throw away my striped tie  
I'll throw away my best pressed tweed  
  
'It's a very aqward moment here in the theatre right now.  
You don't know exactly how to act or what to think.  
And I'm in control.  
  
A spattering of applause makes the people yet more uncomfortable.'  
  
Oh I really need (Oh I really need)  
Oh I really need (Oh I really need)  
All I really need (All I really need)  
All I really need (All I really need)  
Oh I really need (Oh I really need)  
  
Hey hey hey hey hey (Hey hey hey hey hey)  
Oh oh oh oh oh (Oh oh oh oh oh)  
I I I I I (I I I I I)  
  
Ai ai ai ai ai (Ai ai ai ai ai)  
Ai ai ai ai ai (Ai ai ai ai ai)  
Ai ai ai ai ai  
  
Ai ai ai ai ai( Ai ai ai ai ai)  
Ai ai ai ai ai (Ai ai ai ai ai)  
  
Hagali hagali how (Hagali hagali how)  
Buggeli buggeli boo (Buggeli buggeli boo)  
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh (Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)  
  
All I really need is the  
Girl

The touch of your lips next to mine  
Gets me excited, makes me feel fine  
The touch of your hand, your sweet hello  
The fire inside you when you're holding me close  
Your love so warm and tender  
The thrill is so divine  
It is all these things that make you mine  
Make you mine  
  
If you would leave, I surely would die  
When you were ten minutes late  
I started to cry  
I've got it bad, it's all right  
As long as you're here every night  
Your love so warm and tender  
The thrill is so divine  
It is all these things, baby, that make you mine  
  
Your love so warm and tender  
The thrill is so divine  
It is all these things that make you mine

I used to be a booze hound  
Spent my time downtown  
  
Gettin' round  
Sittin' in the barroom  
Tryin' to get another drink  
"I think you've had enough"  
"come on, just one more"  
This time I ain't feelin' so fine  
What cha say we get to downin'  
Don't throw me just forget about the line  
I wish I could be drownin'  
Sweet water, I ain't seen her in a while  
I don't know if I can face her  
I know she can always make me smile  
If I can't outrun my chaser  
I used to be a booze hound  
  
Buzzin' round midtown  
Gettin' loaded  
Tryin' to get a number  
Feelin' mighty good  
  
"is this guy bothering you? "  
"no, no, I was just"  
All my life there ain't never been a drought  
That's probably been my downfall  
Even though, you know,  
I might be passed out  
I won't drop the high ball  
I know where the river flows  
And the lives that it devours  
Ain't it great I can touch my nose  
But I can't smell the flowers  
I used to be a booze hound  
  
Stumblin' uptown  
Gettin' higher  
Fallin' off the bar stool  
Rememberin' where I left the floor  
"say buddy, you need some help"  
"no, I'm cool"  
  
Come and get me you can be my boogey man  
You can catch me on the rebound  
You may not fly like the candy man can  
But it's safer on the ground  
Just one more trip to the fun house  
They'll smother me with foam  
See, my brother, that's the one house  
That I can call my home

The sun sets red with rage  
White clouds float by  
Like high cotton  
Blank as an empty page  
Blue is a color buried  
Not forgotten  
  
Sweet as mother's milk  
And clear as the wind  
Wrap the dead in a pleat of silk  
Blue is the color to be buried in  
  
When you left  
Leaving nothing behind  
There's no one to blame  
No criminal, no crime  
You can report a missing person  
But not a stolen heart  
And I'm missing a person  
To whom stealing was an art  
  
The painting's complete  
The brush strokes dry  
I hear a band playing  
A bent note or two  
I guess someone died  
And just wants to be  
Buried in blue

They're writing songs of love  
But not for me  
A lucky star's above  
But not for me  
  
With love to lead the way  
I've found more clouds of gray  
Than any russian play  
Could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall  
And get that way  
Hi ho! alas!  
And also, lackaday!  
  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
She's not for me  
  
It all began so well  
But what an end  
This is the time  
A fellow needs a friend  
  
When every happy plot  
Ends with a the marriage knot  
And there's  
No knot for me

Must you dance every dance  
With the same fortunate man  
You have danced with him since the music began  
Why don't you change partners and dance with me  
  
Must you stand quite so close  
With your lips touching his face  
Can't you see I'm longing to be in his place  
Why don't you change partners and dance with me  
  
Ask him to sit this one out  
And while you're alone  
I'll tell the waiter to tell him  
He's wanted on the telephone  
  
You've been locked in his arms  
Ever since heaven knows when  
Why don't you change partners and then  
You may never want to change partners again

When we played our charade  
We were like children posing  
Playing at games, acting out names  
Guessing the parts we played  
  
Oh, what a hit we made  
We came on next to closing  
Best on the bill, lovers until  
Love left the masquerade  
  
Fate seemed to pull the strings  
I turned and you were gone  
While from the darkened wings  
The music box played on  
  
Sad little serenade  
Song of my hearts composing  
I hear it still, I always will  
Best on the bill, charade

(Hi there Tex, what you say?)  
Step aside partner, it's my day  
bend an ear, and listen to my version  
of a really solid Tennessee excursion  
pardon me boys, is that the Chattanooga Choo-Choo?  
(Yes, Yes, Track 29)  
Hey would you give me a shine?  
(Can you afford to board Chattanooga Choo-Choo?)  
I got my fare  
and just the travel to spare  
you leave the Pennsylvania Station by a quarter to four  
you read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore  
dinner in a diner  
nothing could be finer  
and then to have a hammer in the Carolina  
when you hear the whistle blowing into the bar  
then you now the Tennessee is not very far  
shove a all the coal in  
gotta keep a rollin'  
woo-woo Chattanooga there you are  
there's gonna be  
a certain party at the station  
Satin and Lace (ooh)  
I use to call funny face  
(doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
she's gonna cry  
until I promise to never ever roll,  
so Chattanooga choo-choo  
won't you choo choo me home  
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)  
get aboard  
(Chattanooga Chattanooga)  
Chattanooga choo choo  
won't you choo-choo me home  
Chattanooga choo choo  
let's dance

Come by me, come talk to me baby  
Tell me how we can combine  
Will you be my sunshine forever  
Will you be a friend of mine  
  
Try me out and if you get excited  
Take me home, I'd love to be invited  
Once we're there, I'm sure you'll be delighted  
We can rock all night  
  
Wait and see, we might fit together  
That would be my lucky day  
Come by me, come love with me baby  
Maybe we could run away

Now you say you're lonely  
You cry the whole night through  
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head  
You never she'd a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
Told me love was too plebeian, told me you were through with me  
  
And now you say you love me  
Well, just to prove you do  
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you

Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled all around, in and out of town  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled till the butcher cut him down  
  
He rambled through the city  
He rambled through the street  
Little ol' lady pass him by said  
"Look at the market meat!"  
  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled all around, in and out of town  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled till the butcher cut him down  
  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled all around, in and out of town  
Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble  
He rambled till the butcher shot him down  
  
He rambled through the city

Didn't he ramble, didn't he ramble

Well, give me land, lots of land under starry skies above  
But don't fence me in  
Let me ride through that wide open country that i love  
Don't fence me in  
Let me be by myself in the evening breeze  
Listen to the murmur of the cottonwood trees  
Send me off forever but i ask you please  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till i see the mountains rise  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to ride to the ridge where the west commences  
Gaze at the moon till i lose my senses  
I don't like hobbles and i can't stand fences  
Don't fence me in  
  
Just turn me loose, let me straddle my old saddle  
Underneath the western skies  
On my cayuse, let me wander over yonder  
Till i see the mountains rise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh no, don't you fence me in

Missed the saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't get around much anymore  
  
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless, why stir up memories  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Awfully different without you  
Don't get around much anymore

Don't like goodbyes, tears or sighs  
I'm not too good at leavin' time  
I got no taste for grievin' time, no, no, not me  
You've been my near ones, always my dear ones  
I never thought that I would find  
Another love, a different kind but it came to be  
Well, if you think I'm tellin' you lies  
Go try your luck and look into her eyes  
But remember, you must remember she's mine  
And my world overhead has a clear new shine  
Don't want to leave you, sorry to grieve you  
It's travelin' time and I must move on  
Found the girl to lean upon  
And if I could arrange it  
Would I care to change it? Not me  

They tried to conquer the world with guns  
Like a horde of Huns  
That had to be removed  
We used a secret weapon  
We did it with a groove  
  
They tried to conquer the world with administration  
And make one nation  
But then they had to move  
We made us a home  
Built on a groove  
  
They tried to conquer the world with kindness  
And blind open-mindedness  
Like they had something to prove  
They're on their own  
Amen, we got the groove  
  
They tried to conquer the world and call it art  
So did Bonaparte  
Now he hangs in the Louvre  
It's not a museum piece  
This is the groove

For once in my life I have someone who needs me  
Someone I've needed so  
For once unafraid I can go where life leads me  
And somehow I know I'll be strong  
  
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew  
Someone warm like you  
Could make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone I know won't desert me  
I'm not alone anymore  
  
For once I can say: "this is mine you can't take it"  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life I've got someone who needs me  
  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it's hurt me before  
For once I've got someone I know won't desert me  
I'm not alone anymore  
  
Now, for once I can say: "this is mine you can't take it"  
As long as I've got love I know I can make it  
For once in my life I've got someone who needs me  
For once in my life, she needs me  
For once in my life

Meet me on the corner of close and soon  
I'll have a song in my head  
And my hands on a tune  
Nothing lasts forever  
So I figure I better  
Take you forever  
For now  
  
Meet me in the lobby of destiny  
I'll have a ribbon on my shoulders  
And a halo over me  
If nothing lasts forever  
I guess I better  
Take you forever  
For now  
  
Under a clock  
By an information desk  
I'll be there will bells on  
By an old oak  
A fountain in the park  
Just don't be long  
  
By the ticket counter for love in spring  
I'll be standin' there with cupid  
And he can aim that thing  
Nothing lasts forever  
It's not a question of whether  
I'll take you forever  
For now

Frosty the Snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corncob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Is a fairytale, they say  
He was made of snow but the children know  
How he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
Dns the children say he could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "Let's run and we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away"  
  
Down to the village  
With a brooomstick in his hand  
Running here and there, all around the square,  
Sayin', "Catch me if you can"  
  
He led them down the streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment  
When he heard him holler, "Stop!"  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye, sayin' "Don't you cry,  
I'll be back again some day. "  
  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Look at Frosty go  
Thumpety thump thump  
Thumpety thump thump  
Over the hills of snow  
  
He'll be back  
Yes he will  
Again someday  
See you next year Frosty!

Goodnight, my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me  
  
Before you go  
Please remember I need you so  
And this love I have for me  
Will never go cold  
  
If you should awake in the still of the night  
Please have no fear  
Just close your eyes  
Then you realize  
That my love will watch over you, dear, always  
  
Goodnight, my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me  
  
If you should awake in the still of the night  
Please have no fear  
Just close your eyes  
Then you realize  
That my love will watch over you, dear, always  
  
Goodnight, my love  
Pleasant dreams and sleep tight, my love  
May tomorrow be sunny and bright  
And bring you closer to me

He is good  
They are happy  
He is strong  
They are secure  
He is right  
They are unquestioning  
He is wrong  
They are demure  
  
When she left  
He was tortured  
She was gone  
They were confused  
He was forgetful  
They were supportive  
He was funny  
They were amused  
  
He did things that only superman could do  
Things that sis and I could not believe were true  
  
He is older  
They are loving  
He is hardened  
They are grown  
He is needing  
They are giving  
He is glad they are his own

Oh, hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly  
It's so nice to have you back where you belong  
You're lookin' swell, Dolly, I can tell, Dolly  
You're still glowin', you're still crowin', you're still goin' strong  
We feel the room swayin' while the band's playin'  
One of your old favorite songs from way back when  
So, take her wrap fellas, find her an empty lap, fellas  
Dolly won't never ever go away again  
Hey, hello Dolly, well, hello Dolly  
It's really nice to have you back where you belong  
Girl, you're lookin' swell, Dolly, I can tell, Dolly  
Still glowin', still crowin', you're still goin' strong  
We feel the room swayin' while the band's playin'  
One of your old favorite songs from way back when  
So, take her wrap fellas, find her a big fat lap, fellas  
Dolly don't ever go away, Dolly don't you ever, ever go away  
Dolly don't you ever go away again  

Step aside  
Step aside  
The krewe's gonna take a ride  
Better stand behind the barricade  
Here comes, here comes, here comes  
The big parade  
  
So make way  
So make way  
That's what the captain say  
Down st. Charles and esplanade  
Here comes  
The big parade  
  
"throw me somethin mister"  
I wanna dance with your sister  
Brass bands marchin by  
Throwing notes to the sky  
  
There goes  
There goes  
Second-liners and flambeaus  
I'm feelin even better  
Than the day was made  
Here comes  
Here comes  
Here comes  
The big parade

Have a holly jolly Christmas  
It's the best time of the year  
Well  
I don't know if there'll be snow  
But have a cup of cheer  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet  
  
Ho ho the mistletoe  
Hung where you can see  
Somebody waits for you  
Kiss her once for me  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didn't hear  
Oh, bygolly  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
This year  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And when you walk down the street  
Say hello to friends you know  
And everyone you meet  
  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
And in case you didn't hear  
Oh, bygolly  
Have a holly jolly Christmas  
This year

Honestly now...  
Either you stand for something  
Or you get knocked down for nothing  
Sister don't ache too soon  
I thought it was understood  
By everyone in this room  
Who'd ever come up short or won a race  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Truly now...  
People play tricks of the mind  
Shadows only follow behind  
Sister stay still  
I thought it was the nature  
Of all on malvern's hill  
Who'd taken a lead off third base  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Honestly now...  
If fate were to follow fortune  
And clarity trail distortion  
Sister on alert  
Pay close attention  
To fingerprints in the dust  
And fallen feet that leave no trace  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Sincerely now...  
I requested information  
At a roadside station  
Sister it seems absurd  
To be hammering pith  
Like a poet with a loss for words  
Trying to describe an angel's face  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place  
  
Honestly now...  
Wholly in demand  
Coming off second hand  
Sister don't unravel  
When there's nowhere to go  
Except lawless travel  
And an end to infinity's space  
Safety's just danger  
... Out of place

Standin' on top of my hill  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
How can you tell me to make my bed  
When I sleep on the ground  
How can you say that you like my noise  
When I haven't made a sound  
I like peace time better than war  
Spendin' my money in the candy store  
I like makin' angels on the shore  
How do ya'll know  
  
Floatin' on my cloud  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
Yellin your sermon from the bottom of a glass  
'Cause you know how it's done  
Tellin' me the troubles of the promised land  
When I'm in it just for fun  
I like to eat my pie before my meal  
Make a snake with an orange peel  
Say my prayers before I kneel  
How do ya'll know  
  
When I was walkin' past your house  
I didn't see nobody home  
Ya'll musta been out buyin' gold  
When I was polishin' chrome  
Ridin' in my spaceship  
How do ya'll know what it feels like  
What makes you think you can navigate  
When you don't know where I'm flyin  
Tellin' me the facts about what I say  
When you don't even know if I'm lyin'  
  
I like to wear white in the wintertime  
Pay my penance before the crime  
Have my reason without the rhyme  
But how do ya'll know

What was he saying?  
Looking to her on the  
Night of his birth?  
What did he know, this baby?  
Could she understand?  
How did he know, this baby?  
As she held is hand in hers  
  
I come with love  
I come with love  
To worship and honor  
My father above  
And so with my eyes  
I say to you  
Softly and peacefully  
I come with love  
  
What was he feeling?  
Knowing his time on earth  
Wouldn't be long?  
What did he think, this young man  
In a world of sin?  
What would he tell the strangers?  
When he took them in his arms?  
  
I come with love  
I come with love  
To worship and honor  
My father above  
And so with my eyes  
I say to you  
Softly and peacefully  
I come with love  
  
When he was dying  
And his sweet mother was  
There by his side  
Who did he blame, this savior?  
Sending him to death  
She could hear it in a whisper  
As he took his  
Final breath  
  
I come with love  
I come with love  
To worship and honor  
My father above  
And so with my eyes  
I say to you  
Softly and peacefully  
I come with love

I pray on Christmas  
That the Lord will see me through  
I pray on Christmas  
He'll show me what to do  
  
I pray on Christmas  
He'll help me understand  
And I pray on Christmas  
He'll take me by the hand  
  
I pray on Christmas  
That the sick will soon be strong  
I pray on Christmas  
The Lord will hear my song  
  
I pray on Christmas  
That God will lead the way  
And I pray on Christmas  
He'll get me through another day  
  
I pray on Christmas  
I pray on Christmas  
I pray on Christmas  
He'll get me through another day  
  
I pray on Christmas  
All our problems gonna be worked out  
I pray on Christmas  
God'll show us what love's about  
  
I pray on Christmas  
To do your will each day  
And I pray on Christmas  
That I'll be with you in heaven someday  
  
I pray on Christmas  
Oh, the sick will soon be strong  
I pray on Christmas  
The Lord will hear my song  
  
I pray on Christmas  
That God will lead the way  
And I pray, I really pray on Christmas  
He'll get me through another day  
He'll get me through another day

I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
How Jesus the savior, did come to die  
To save lowly people like you and like I  
I wonder as I wander, out under the sky  
  
Sweet Mary laid Jesus, within a cow's stall  
Came wise men and farmers and shepherds and all  
The blessings of Christmas heaven did fall  
And God's promise of ages, to them did recall  
  
If Jesus had wanted for any small thing  
A cloud in the sky or a bird on the wing  
Or all of God's angels in heaven to sing  
He surely could have had it, because  
He was the King  
Because He was King!

I could while away the hours  
Conferrin' with the flowers  
Consultin' with the rain  
And my head I'd be scratchin'  
While my thoughts were busy hatchin'  
If I only had a brain  
  
I'd unravel any riddle  
For any individd-el  
In trouble or in pain  
With the thoughts I'd be thinkin'  
I could be another Lincoln  
If I only had a brain  
  
Oh, I could tell you why  
The ocean's near the shore  
I could think of things I never thunk before  
And then I'd sit and think some more  
  
I would not be just a nothin'  
My head all full of stuffin'  
My heart all full of pain  
Perhaps I deserve you  
And be even worthy serve you  
If I only had  
If I only had a brain

Ask me how do I feel  
Now that we're cosy and clinging  
Well sir, all I can say, is if I were a bell I'd be ringing!  
  
From the moment we kissed tonight  
That's the way I've just gotta behave  
Boy, if I were a lamp I'd light  
And If I were a banner I'd wave!  
  
Ask me how do I feel, little me with my quiet upbringing  
Well sir, all I can say is if gate I'd be swinging!  
And if I were a watch I'd start popping my springs!  
Or if I were a bell I'd go ding dong, ding dong ding!  
  
Ask me how do I feel from this chemistry lesson I'm learning.  
Well sir, all I can say is if I were a bridge I'd be burning!  
Yes, I knew my moral would crack  
From the wonderful way that you looked!  
Boy, if I were a duck I'd quack!  
Or if I were a goose I'd be cooked!  
  
Ask me how do I feel,  
Now that we're fondly caressing  
Well, if I were a salad I know I'd be splashing my dressing  
Oh, If I were a season  
I shortly be spring  
Yes, or if I were a bell I'd go  
Ding dong, ding dong ding!

I'll only miss her when I think of her  
And I'll think of her all the time  
Likely I'll spend my days hearing her turn of a phrase  
Things I found hard to praise, right now, would seem sublime  
  
And the truth is  
I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs  
'Cause it's still her laugh my heart hears  
Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less  
  
And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears  
I'll bet I forget her completely  
In about a hundred years  
The truth is  
  
I'll only miss her when some stranger laughs  
'Cause it's still her laugh my heart hears  
Maybe in time, I guess, the longing will grow the slightest bit less  
And there will be moments, yes, when it disappears  
  
I'll bet I forget her completely  
In about a hundred years.

Oh, step aside, y'all ornery tenderfeet  
Cause I'm about to sing my song  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
But my legs ain't bowed, and my cheeks ain't tan  
Well I'm a cowboy who never saw a cow  
Never roped a steer 'cause I don't know how  
And I sure ain't fixin' to startin now  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
And I learned to ride before I learned to stand  
Well I'm a ridin fool who is up to date  
I know every trail in the lone star state  
'cause I ride the range in a ford v-8  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
Look out, I'm gonna show y'all how to ride now  
Here we go  
  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
And I come to town just to hear the band  
I know all the songs that the cowboys know  
'bout the big corral where the dogies go  
'cause I learned them all on the radio  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
Now my story's almost done, so listen up!  
You ain't got much longer now  
  
I'm an old cowhand from the rio grande  
Where the west is wild round the borderland  
Where the buffalo roam around the zoo  
And the indian make you a rug or two  
And the old bar-x is the bar-be-cue  
Oh, yippee-i-o-ki-ay, yippee-i-o-ki-ay  
  
I'm just an old cowhand...

I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'  
About you and me, I'm hopin'  
That you'll come back to me,  
I'm lonely as I can be, I'm waitin'  
For your company, I'm hopin'  
That you'll come back to me  
  
What you gonna do when the well runs dry?  
You gonna run away and hide  
I'm gonna run right by your side  
For you pretty baby I'll even die  
I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'  
About you and me, I'm hopin'  
That you'll come back to me  
  
Well, what you gonna do when the well runs dry?  
You're gonna sit right down and cry  
What you gonna do when I say goodbye  
All you gonna do is dry your eye  
I'm walkin', yes indeed and I'm talkin'  
About you and me, I'm hopin'  
That you'll come back to me

It's time to admit you love me  
The flush of your cheek betrays  
I hear a sigh in your voice  
Your every word conveys  
  
It's time to admit you love me  
I feel the weight of your gaze  
The smile that's mine alone  
Your starry eyes sparkle ablaze  
  
It's such a simple thing  
How hard can it be  
These few words  
Endear you to me  
  
It's time to admit I love you  
And lift the worry from your brow  
Rest your head upon my shoulder  
There's nothing to be afraid of now

The last days in may  
Before summer lay claim  
Back in the school yard  
We made up a game  
Now is always  
Is always the same  
Too bad always always ends  
  
I remember  
I remember when  
But I was just  
Just a boy  
Then  
  
Innocent envy  
Without compromise  
Recommendations  
All ill advised  
Tall tales  
And little white lies  
The truth had to bend  
  
I remember  
I remember when  
But I was just  
Just a boy  
Then  
  
Now that we're tall  
And all grown  
A house a car  
Lives of our own  
We put off  
But we can't postpone  
The way we become men  
  
I remember  
I remember when  
But I was just  
Just a boy  
Then

It's three o'clock in the morning  
I'm wonderin' what to do to save the sun  
The space that I take  
Is more than I can give  
And Lorelei's song has just begun  
  
I'm gonna turn my head  
Time eternity  
I'm gonna find somebody  
Just like me  
  
Everybody's pretty  
My brother won't rest 'til he knows I'm home  
The choices I make  
Are easier supposed  
As my surviving striving not to roam  
  
I'm gonna stand my ground  
Make my guarantee  
I'm gonna find somebody  
Just like me  
  
The world keeps spinning  
Mountains vary but the valley's the same  
The confidence I feel  
As I balance on the ridge  
Comes from the trueness of my aim  
  
I'm gonna walk this road  
As far as I can see  
I'm gonna find somebody just like me  
I'm gonna find somebody just like me

Lazybones  
You know I am gettin' tired doing all the work my self  
Man you ain't doin' all the work  
I just can't seem to get the help around here  
Oh Johny don't give me that man  
Can't you hear me  
I hear you baba  
No, I guess not  
  
Lazybones, sleeping in the sun  
How you 'spect to get your day's work done?  
Never get your day's work done  
Sleeping in the new day's sun  
  
Nah, that's your side of the story Johny  
Tell me yours  
I'm about to tell you mine  
  
Lazybones, sleepin' in the shade  
How you 'spect to get your cornmeal made?  
You'll never get your cornmeal made  
Just sleepin' in the evenin' shade  
  
When 'taters need spraying I bet you keep praying  
The bugs fall off the vine  
And when you go fishin', I bet you keep wishin'  
The fish won't grab your line Oh no  
  
Lazybones, loafing through the day  
How you 'spect to get a dime that way?  
Never make a dime that way ha  
Never heard a word I say  
  
When 'taters need spraying I bet you keep praying  
The bugs fall off the vine  
And when you go fishin', I bet you keep wishin'  
The fish won't grab your line  
  
Lazybones, loafing through the day  
How you 'spect to make a dime that way? Well looky here  
Never make a dime that way  
Never heard a word I say  
  
Man u ain't workin  
I don't get a chance to go fishin' I have to do all the work  
Ah you think so huh  
I know so  
I ain't seen no fish  
They don't bit cause you still sleepin'  
That's cause you set my alarm clock 4 hours later just so you can brag about
workin'  
I don't even get a nibble  
Cause u ain't usin' the right bait man

Let them talk if they want to  
Talk don't bother me  
I want the whole wide world to know  
That I love you so  
  
Let them whisper  
For they know not what's  
Between you and I  
I'll keep on loving you  
Until the day I die  
  
They're tryin' to breakup our romance  
But they don't have a chance  
We have the kind of love  
That's so strong  
We'll be together from now on  
  
Idle gossip comes from the devil's workshop  
But true love will make it stop  
I want the whole wide world to know  
That I love you so  
  
They're envious of everything we do  
But it's so wonderful (wonderful)  
When you love some one (love someone)  
When that someone loves you

Let there be peace on earth  
And let it begin with me  
Let there be peace on earth  
The peace that was meant to be  
With God as our father  
Brothers all are we  
Let me walk with my brother  
In perfect harmony  
  
Let peace begin with me  
Let this be the moment now  
With every step i take  
Let this be my solemn vow  
To take each moment  
And live each moment  
With peace eternally  
Let there be peace on earth  
And let it begin with me  
  
Let there be peace on earth  
And let it begin with me  
Let there be peace on earth  
The peace that was meant to be  
With god as our father  
Brothers all are we  
Let me walk with my brother  
In perfect harmony  
  
Let peace begin with me  
Let this be the moment now  
With every step I take  
Let this be my solemn vow  
To take each moment  
And live each moment  
In peace eternally  
Let there be peace on earth  
And let it begin with me

You say "either" and I say "either"  
You say "neither" I say "neither"  
"Either" "either", "neither" "neither"  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
You say "potato" I say "patattah"  
You say "tomato" I say "creole tomatah"  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
Oh, if we call the whole thing off  
Then we must part and  
Oh, if we ever part  
That would break my heart  
  
I say "ursta" you say "oyster"  
I'm not gonna stop eatin urstas  
Just cause you say oysters,  
Let's call the whole thing off  
  
I say "pajamas" you say "pajamas"  
Sugar, what's the problem?  
For we know we need each other so  
We'd better call the calling off off  
  
Oh let's call it off, oh let's call it off  
Oh let's call it off, baby let's call it off  
  
Sugar why don't we call it off,  
I'm talking baby why call it off  
Let's call the whole thing off

If we borrow words  
They'll have to be returned  
Keeping them would surely be remiss  
The stars have acquiesced  
By giving us this night  
Let's just kiss  
  
Intellect and thought  
Are good enough for some  
Why waste time with all there is to miss  
In our quiet space  
We'll babysit the moon  
Let's just kiss  
  
Nothing to erase  
As the hour slows  
Nothing to be judged or tried untrue  
Handed us a case  
What a case to close  
It could take all night before we do  
  
We won't have to try  
Somehow we'll just know  
A thousand years before us led to this  
When we're finally through  
We'll usher in the sun  
Let's just kiss

O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
  
Yet in they dark streets shineth  
The everlasting light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep the angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
  
O morning starts together  
Proclaim thy holy birth  
And praises sing to God the King  
And peace to men on earth

Long time ago in Bethlehem  
So the Holy Nible say  
Mary's boy child Jesus Christ  
Was born on Christmas day  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new king born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
While shepherds watch their flock by night  
They see a bright new shining star  
Then hear a choir sing  
The music seemed to come from afar  
  
Now Joseph and his wife Mary  
Come to Bethlehem that night  
Then find no place to born the child  
Not a single room was in sight  
  
Hark now hear the angels sing  
A new king born today  
And man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
Trumpets sound and angels sing  
Listen what they say  
That man will live forevermore  
Because of Christmas day  
  
By and by they find a little nook  
In a stable all forlorn  
And in a manger cold and dark  
Mary's little boy was born

Maybe far away, or maybe real near by.  
He may be pouring her coffee,  
She may be Straightening his tie.  
Maybe in a house all hidden by a hill,  
She's sitting playing Piano,  
He's sitting paying a bill.  
  
Betcha they're young.  
Betcha they're smart,  
Bet they collect things like ashtrays and art.  
Betcha there good.  
Why shouldn't they be?  
Their one mistake was giving up me.  
  
So maybe now it's time,  
And maybe when I wake,  
They'll be there calling me baby,  
Maybe.

Mama told me not to try to be nobody  
I listened to her  
Mama told me I'd grow up to be somebody  
Looka here  
  
Savin' money's hard when you can't save your soul  
I'll get through it  
Tryin' to dig myself out of this mighty hole  
Listen to what I say  
  
Got my mind on the matter  
Sure as I tell ya  
Now you know that's right  
I look down at my hands and  
I see labor burns  
It's a part of livin'  
Keepin' my feet on the ground while the world turns  
  
It's all on me  
Got my mind on the matter  
Sure as I tell ya  
Now you know that's right

I look at them shuffle and the shuffle come down  
Ramblin' and scramblin' and a-headin' for town  
Hoppin' and boppin' and a-buzzin' around  
Happily awaitin' at the station  
I look at that train number 709  
Hoppin' and boppin' and arrivin' on time  
Who do you think is about to arrive  
The band they call the Dixieland Five  
  
They're gonna play that muskrat ramble tune  
Like the way you never heard it played  
Get ready for the big parade  
All together now - one and two  
Join that happy crowd  
Tellin' me that ramblin' scramblin' muskrat song  
Come on, ramble along  
Yeah

Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
And miss her each night and day  
I know I'm not wrong because the feeling's  
Getting stronger the longer I stay away  
  
Miss the moss-covered vines, tall sugar pines  
Where mockingbirds used to sing  
I'd love to see that old lazy Mississippi  
Running in the spring  
  
Moonlight on the bayous  
Creole tunes fill the air  
I dream about magnolias in June  
And I'm wishin I was there  
  
Do you know what it means to miss New Orleans  
When that's where you left your heart  
And there's one thing more, I miss the one I care for  
More than I miss New Orleans

Save time to collect my fortune  
Paid upon arrival  
But I don't know where I'll be goin'  
I'm travelin' survival  
Aw, girl  
When I get there  
If it ain't for free  
I want you to know there's  
Nobody like you to me  
  
I've been scarred by my commitment  
To tell them what I see  
But I can't see that I've  
Been blinded  
By mediocrity  
Aw, girl  
If I dare  
To change what it should be  
I want you to know there's  
Nobody like you to me  
  
Maybe I should take it easy  
Seems I'm the only one  
But you won't let me rest my conscience  
'Til all I know is done  
Aw, girl  
If I care  
Enough to disagree  
I want you to know there's  
Nobody like you to me

I see my own reflection in the window  
I hear the people carry'n on below  
I know the one I love is out there somewhere  
To me that somewhere's not far to go  
  
Ev'ry year I make my resolution  
To find my love and make her all my own  
But it looks like she decided not to show again  
And I'll be singing 'Auld Lang Syne' alone  
  
People grow accustomed to their lifestyles  
It's easier to settle in your ways  
I wish that I had someone to get used to  
To settle down until my dying days  
  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
All I wanted was an angel that I don't expect to see  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
  
It don't mean nothing if you're crying all the time  
And there's no one there to see your tears  
And it don't mean nothing if you're passing up your prime  
And I been passing mine for years  
  
And so, to my reflection in the window  
I'll raise my glass and make a toast to you  
I've never known a man to be heartbroken  
My someone that he never even knew  
  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
Nothin' new for new year for me  
All I wanted was an angel that I don't expect to see  
Nothin' new for new year for me

In a way, I really don't know much at all  
And if you say that I'm simple, you're on the ball  
On the ball to say that I'm going nowhere  
But I'm going nowhere with love  
  
They all say that I'm not impressive at best  
That's O. K., I've got nobody to impress  
My impression is they'd rather be elsewhere  
Oh, I'm staying nowhere with love  
  
Well, it's better to be happy in a cardboard shack  
Than to be alone in a castle  
All you get for your money is a heart attack  
I'd just as soon alleviate the hassle  
  
Every day, I watch the go-getters go by  
Even they say the ladder is much too high  
Why should I go high, I'm happy below there  
Right here in nowhere with love

O' come all ye faithful  
Joyful and triumphant  
O' come ye, o' come ye  
To Bethlehem  
Come and behold Him  
Born the King of Angels  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord  
  
Yea, Lord we greet thee  
Born this happy morning  
Oh Jesus to thee be all glory given  
Word of the Father  
Now in flesh appearing  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
O' come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord  
  
O' come let us adore him  
Christ The Lord

Oh, Danny boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling  
From glen to glen and down the mountain side  
The summer's gone and all the roses falling  
It's you, it's you, must go and I must bide  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow  
It's I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh, Danny boy, oh, Danny boy, I love you so  
  
But when ye come and all the flowers are dying  
If I am dead and dead I well may be  
You'll come and find the place where I am lying  
And kneel and say an 'Ave' there for me  
  
And I shall hear tho' soft you tread above me  
And all my grave will warmer, sweeter be  
For you will bend and tell me that you love me  
And I shall sleep in peace until you come to me

Do you hear that whistle down the line?  
I figure that it's engine number forty-nine  
She's the only one that'll sound that way  
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe  
  
See the old smoke risin 'round the bend  
I reckon that she knows she's gonna meet a friend  
Folks around these parts get the time of day  
From the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe  
  
Here she comes  
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  
Hey Jim, you'd better get the rig  
Whoo hoo hoo hoo hoo  
She's got a list of passengers that's pretty big  
  
And they'll all want lifts to Brown's Hotel  
'Cause of lots of them been travelin for quite a spell  
All the way from Philadelphia  
On the Atchison, Topeka, and the Santa Fe

Turn off the music  
Take down the signs  
Pack up the boxes  
Put away the wine  
No toast for the future  
No reward for the find  
  
If looks could kill  
This mirror would do  
Only 'cause I don't have you  
  
Don't bother with ovations  
Leave off the fanfare  
Let the candles melt down  
Till the smoke's all that's there  
Leave the veil in place  
A tear, la mer  
I could say it was nothing  
Now that there's nothing new  
Only 'cause I don't have you  
  
Not built on a wisp or whim  
Twist an arm, break a leg  
Tear me limb from limb  
If there's a point you've made it  
If there's a fare I've paid it  
  
Later on good wishes  
Later on good try  
I'm afraid won't do  
It's not justified  
You go from the privy  
And you end up deprived  
On top of the world  
But still there's no view  
Only 'cause I don't have you

Oh please, don't talk about me when I'm gone  
Although our friendship ceases from now on  
  
Hey carmen, if you can't say anything real nice  
It's better not to talk at all, that's my advice  
  
We are parting  
You go your way  
I'll go mine  
It's best that we do  
Here's a little kiss  
I hope that this brings lots of love to you  
  
Makes no difference how I carry on  
'cause baby I know you'd better not talk about me when I'm gone

I'm catchin a plane home  
I can feel the wind on my hair  
Maybe someone's out there  
Someone just as bare  
And if somebody stacked the cards  
I hope they're stacked for me  
You see...  
I feel just like a kid on christmas eve  
You may not know my reason  
But I've got reason to believe  
My eyes gettin heavy  
Hope I can make a bed tonight  
I'll go to sleep alone  
My true love stays unknown  
My life's an open book  
And it starts on chapter nine  
I'm fine...  
A tangled web is easier to weave  
You may not know the reason  
But I've got reason to believe  
I had my fortune told  
By a fork tongued lady  
She told me I'd amount to what I paid her  
I left her feeling worse  
Than I did when I came in  
And I know more now than I'd find out later  
I wish I had an easy mind  
And a pretty girl to hold my hand  
Seems the closer I get  
The water isn't wet  
This lonely life of mine  
Is the best I've ever had  
It's not bad...  
My coat's the only thing that's on my sleeve  
You may not know my reason  
But I've got reason to believe

A little bit of me and a whole lot of you  
Add a dash of starlight and a dozen roses, too  
Then let it rise for a hundred years or two  
And that's the recipe for making love  
  
It doesn't need sugar 'cause it's already sweet  
It doesn't need an oven 'cause it's got a lot of heat  
Just add a dash of kisses to make it all complete  
And that's the recipe for making love  
  
And if you've made it right you'll know it  
It's not like anything you've made before  
And if you've made it wrong you'll know it  
'cause it won't keep you coming back for more  
  
I didn't get it from my grandma's book upon the shelf  
I didn't get it from a magical and culinary elf  
No, a little birdie told me you can't make it by yourself  
And that's the recipe for making love

Hey Kids!  
You know Dasher and Dancer and Prancer and Vixen  
Comet and Cupid and Donner and Blitzen  
But do you recall  
The most famous reindeer of all  
  
Rudolph, the red-nosed reindeer  
Had a very shiny nose  
And if you ever saw it  
You would even say it glows  
  
All of the other reindeer  
Used to laugh and call him names  
They never let poor Rudolph  
Join in any reindeer games  
  
Then one foggy Christmas Eve  
Santa came to say  
"Rudolph, with your nose so bright  
Won't you guide my sleigh tonight"  
  
Then how the reindeer's loved him  
As they shouted out with glee  
"Rudolph the red-nosed reindeer  
You'll go down in history"

I think I saw ol' santa through my window christmas eve  
My eyes were really droopy but I really do believe  
It must've been ol' santa 'cause I saw his big red hat  
And I know my mom and dad can't fly like that  
  
And then I heard some footsteps in the hall outside my door  
The same ol' christmas trick my dad had played since I was four  
He stands outside my bedroom yelling "ho! ho! ho!" because  
He knows I don't believe in santa claus  
  
I think my daddy sees me  
Peeking from my door  
But he pretends he's santa anyway  
Every year he tries to fool me  
But I'm a big boy now I don't believe in santa or his sleigh...  
No way!  
  
So I went back to bed and I curled up nice and tight  
I stared out my window and looked into the night  
And then, all of a sudden, through my window I could see  
Santa claus was flying by and smiling at me  
  
Chorus:  
Santa claus, santa claus  
It must've been ol' santa claus  
Santa claus, santa claus  
Happy "ho! ho! ho!" to you  
  
Then I heard ol' rudolph tellin' me to come outside  
He told me that ol' santa wanted me to take a ride  
I climbed out of my window and I jumped onto his sleigh  
Then ol' santa took me up up and away  
  
We flew high above the rooftops of my sleepy town below  
I saw my big red school house and the town square picture show  
It was really past my bedtime and so ol' santa said  
"little boys like you should be in bed"  
  
So I hollered "ho! ho! ho!"  
And I put on santa's hat  
Then he let me hold the reins awhile  
We pulled up to my window  
And I jumped back in my room  
And I waved goodbye to santa with a smile  
  
When I woke up christmas morning it was clear and bright  
My parents said my window had blown open in the night  
I smiled as I told them that it must've been the cat  
And they asked me where I got my big red hat  
  
Chorus

You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He's making a list  
And checking it twice  
Gonna find out  
Who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is coming to town  
  
He sees when you are sleeping  
He knows when you're awake  
He knows when you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
  
You better watch out  
You better not cry  
You better not pout  
I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is coming to town

Lay a hand  
Upon the water  
Well within, well within  
  
Wash away  
To fair morrow  
Ride ahead, ride ahead  
  
Make your mark  
Upon the rock  
For another one  
  
Ashes tell tales  
Fire gives faith  
Burn it up burn it up  
Burn it up burn it up  
  
She would waste not, not in struggle  
No other shall there ever be  
And what she is to love, listen oh my brother  
Is as the wind to mercury  
  
Don't you pray  
Of a heartless town  
Or you'll be forced to flee  
  
Don't you live  
In a soulless city  
Or you'll have to leave  
  
You don't need  
No place of birth  
Hither to come home  
  
Many a night  
Were you ready for your bed  
But your bed not ready for you  
  
She would give of herself  
And ask not return or eternity  
And what she'd offer, listen oh my brother  
Is as the wind to mercury  
  
And she'd hold not, of another man  
No other shall there ever be  
And whom she would hold  
Listen oh my brother  
Is as the wind to mercury

I met her... But I never thought  
She'd belong to me  
I just wanted someone I could sing to  
Who'd listen to every song  
Oh, I just wanted someone I could cling to  
Cling to all night long  
  
So I kissed her... But I never thought  
She'd belong to me  
And when I felt her lips I skipped a heartbeat  
'Cause I was so in love with this girl  
Oh, and how many times does your heart meet  
The most beautiful girl in the world  
  
So I thought and thought about her  
I just couldn't stop thinking about her  
And I died when she called me up and said  
She couldn't stop thinking about me  
  
Now I love her... but I never thought  
She'd belong to me  
Now guys are calling wanting to be boyfriends  
But they're going to have to answer to me  
Oh, 'cause I'm going to tell all those toy friends  
That she belongs to me

Well, I'm the Sheik of Araby and your love, well, it belongs to me  
At night when you're asleep, into your tent I'll creep  
And the stars that shine above, they'll light our way to love  
You'll rule this land with me, I'm the Sheik of Araby, baby  
  
I'm a Sheik, not the freak but the Sheik of Araby  
And your love belongs to me  
At night when you're asleep, into baby, your tent I'll creep  
And the stars that shine above, they'll light our way to love  
You'll rule this land with me, I'm a Sheik, not the freak  
  
Oh, I'm the Sheik of Araby, and your love belongs to me  
At night when you're asleep, baby, into your tent I'll creep  
And the stars that shine above, they'll light our way to love  
You'll rule this land with me, I'm the Sheik of Araby

City sidewalks  
Busy sidewalks  
Dressed in holiday style  
In the air there's a feeling like Christmas  
  
Children laughing  
People passing  
Meeting smile after smile  
And on every street corner you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing  
Soon it will be Christmas day  
  
Strings of street lights  
Even stop lights  
Blink a bright red and green  
As the shoppers rush home with their treasures  
  
Hear the snow crunch  
See the kids bunch  
This is Santa's big scene  
And above all this bustle you hear  
  
Silver bells, silver bells  
It's Christmas time in the city  
Ring-a-ling, hear them sing  
Soon it will be Christmas day

Just hear those sleigh bells jingle-ing  
Ring ting tingle-ing too  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Outside the snow is falling  
And friends are calling "you hoo"  
Come on, it's lovely weather  
For a sleigh ride together with you  
  
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap let's go  
Let's look at the snow  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-yap giddy-yap giddy-yap it's grand  
Just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with the song of a wintry fairy land  
  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy and comfy cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take the road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
  
There's a birthday party at the home of farmer gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop  
Pop! Pop! Pop!  
  
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print by currier and ives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives

Someday,  
You'll want me like I want you  
But I'll be gone  
With somebody new  
  
Someday,  
You'll cry the way I did  
You'll hang your head  
But tears cant begin  
  
You'll walk the floor day, and night  
Not a thing will be going right  
Your nerves will keep you in despair  
You'll be pulling out your hair  
  
Someday,  
Love will get you down, you'll see  
You're gonna suffer  
The way you done for me  
  
You'll walk the floor, day and night  
Not a thing will be going right  
Your nerves will keep you in dispare  
Girl, you'll be pulling out your hair  
  
Someday,  
Love will get you down, you'll see  
You're gonna suffer  
The way you done for me  
  
(you're gonna suffer)  
(the way you done for me)

Now, something you got makes me work all day  
Girl something you got makes me bring home my pay  
Now, something you got you ought to know  
My, my woah, woah, I love you so  
  
Hey, something you got makes the world go on  
Now, something you got keeps me happy all the time  
Now, something you got you ought to know  
My, my, my, woah, woah, I love you so  
  
Hey, something you got keeps me home every night  
Well, now, something you got makes everythin' all right  
Ooh, something you got, you ought to know now  
Well, my, my woah, woah, I love you so, say it again, say it again now  
My, my woah, woah, I love you so, oh, oh  
My, my, my woah, woah, I love you so

I cried all night for Sonny  
'Til my eyes were dry  
'Til the oceans overflowed  
And the Red Sea turned blue  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I heard he was crying, too  
  
I cried all night for Sonny  
We shook hands and said goodbye  
His face was etched with sorrow  
His heart without a hue  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I heard he was crying, too  
  
When you try and love two people  
You can't love either one  
'Cause after a while you'll have to choose  
Or else love self denial  
  
I stayed all night with Sonny  
Like there'd never be another day  
Go on and sleep 'til sunset  
And I'll watch over you  
I cried all night for Sonny  
I know he was crying, too

[Verse:]  
Just a nick of time before I'm home with you  
Just a little while I'm on my way  
I can see you smiling feel your love so true  
Just a little pins on the paint  
  
[Verse:]  
When I think of heaven I see fields of gold  
And angels singing softly just for me  
It would be the sweetest thing that I'll behold  
Stronger than my old magnolia tree  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
  
[Verse:]  
Got no time for hurrying I'll keep my pace  
I don't care if people pass me by  
Know my journey's over when I see your face  
Loving arms and sprung on in your eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
  
[Verse:]  
Just a nick of time before I'm home with you  
Just a little time I'm on my way  
I can see you smiling feel your love so true  
Just a little pins on the paint  
  
[Chorus:]  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
When I'm s'pposed to be  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
Every road I travel leads me back to you  
I'll be with you when I'm s'pposed to be  
  
When I'm s'pposed to be (x4)  
I'm with you  
When I'm s'pposed to be (x4)  
I'm with you  
When I'm s'pposed to be (x4)  
I'm with you

My hands are red  
Admittedly, the cross is mine  
The time is come  
Forsake the brine  
Alone with the void for a thousand years  
I am the first of the reptillian rocketeers  
Doom shins it's bitter brink  
Its goblins casting stench to pave the way  
I'm going off to seek the soul  
Who'll teach me of the day  
A boy will be born in the garden  
I'll wait on a patch of green grass  
Somehow he'll know to find me there  
And place a star upon my crust  
We'll trace the crescent's rim  
Pawn's pursuit of deliverance  
My soul a satchel for musical vim  
Then I'll return to save my race

And now the purple dusk of twilight time  
  
Steals across the meadow of my heart  
  
High up in the sky the little stars climb  
  
Always reminding me that we're apart  
  
You wander down the lane and far away  
  
Leaving me a song that will not die  
  
Love is now a stardust of yesterday  
  
The music of the years gone by  
  
Sometimes I wonder why I spend  
  
The lonely nights dreaming of a song  
  
The melody haunts my reverie  
  
And I am once again with you  
  
When our love was new  
  
And each kiss an inspiration  
  
But that was long ago  
  
Now my consolation  
  
Is in the stardust of a song  
  
Beside the garden wall  
  
When stars are bright  
  
You are in my arms  
  
The nightingale tells his fairy tale  
  
Of paradise where roses bloom  
  
Though I dream in vain  
  
In my heart it will remain  
  
My stardust melody  
  
The memory of love's refrain

Stay awake, don't rest your head  
Don't lie down upon your bed  
While the moon drifts in the skies  
Stay awake, don't close your eyes  
Though the world is fast asleep  
Though your pillow soft and deep  
You're not sleepy as you seem  
Stay awake, don't nod and dream  
Stay awake, don't nod and dream  
Though the world is fast asleep  
Though your pillow's soft and deep  
You're not sleepy as you seem  
Stay awake, don't nod and dream  
Stay awake, don't nod and dream  

Frosted windowpanes  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Santa's on his way  
He's filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and me  
  
It's that time of year  
When the world falls in love  
Ev'ry song you hear seems to say  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Year dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In three-quarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too

In a quaint caravan  
There's a lady they call The Gypsy  
She can look in the future  
And drive away all your fears  
Everything will go right  
If you only believe The Gypsy  
She could tell at a glance  
That my heart was so full of tears  
She looked at my hand  
And told me  
My lover was always true  
Then all at once I knew, dear  
Somebody else was kissing you  
But I'll go there again  
'Cause I want to believe  
The Gypsy  
That my lover is true  
And will come back to me some day  
She looked at my hand  
And told me  
My lover was always true  
Then all at once I knew, dear  
Somebody else was kissing you  
But I'll go there again  
'Cause I got to believe  
The Gypsy  
That my lover is true  
And will come back to me some day  
That my lover is true  
And will come back to me some day  

Seven days a week  
Ev'ry week of the month  
And ev'ry month of the year  
He's got us making presents  
And I'm happy  
  
Ev'ry girl and boy  
Gets their own kind of toy  
We like to fill 'em with joy  
We're workin' over time  
To make 'em happy  
  
Then on Christmas eve  
We jump on big red's sleigh  
We don't miss a chimney  
On our jolly way  
  
We won't stop until  
Every kid gets a fill  
Of Santa's brand of good will  
The thrill of spilling cheer  
Just makes us happy  
  
So, if you've been good yourself  
You might see the happy elf  
Stop by your house and make  
You very happy  
  
The happy elf  
I'm the happy elf  
I'm the happy elf and I just might stop on by  
The happy elf  
I'm the happy elf  
I'm the happy elf and I just might stop on by  
I'm Santa's spy!

Ho!

Someday, when I'm awfully low  
When the world is cold  
I will feel a glow, just thinking of you  
And the way you look tonight  
  
Yes, you're lovely  
With your smile so warm, and your cheeks so soft  
There is nothing for me but to love you  
And the way you look tonight  
  
With each word, your tenderness grows  
Tearing my fears apart  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose  
It touches my foolish heart  
  
Lovely, never ever change,  
Keep that breathless charm  
Won't you please arrange it?  
'Cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight  
  
With each word your tenderness grows  
Tearing my fears apart  
And your laugh, well it wrinkles your nose  
It touches my foolish heart  
  
Lovely, never ever change.  
Keep that breathless charm.  
Won't you please arrange it?  
Because I love you  
Just the way you look tonight

The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Are secretly unhappy men because  
The butcher, the baker, the grocer, the clerk  
Get paid for what they do but no applause  
They'd gladly bid their dreary jobs goodbye  
For anything theatrical and why  
  
There's no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
Everything about it is appealing  
Everything the traffic will allow  
Nowhere could you get that happy feeling  
When you are stealing that extra bow  
  
There's no people like show people  
They smile when they're low  
Even with a turkey that you know will fold  
You may be stranded out in the cold  
Still you wouldn't change it for a sack of gold  
Let's go on with the show  
  
The costumes, the scenery, the makeup, the props  
The audience that lifts you when you're down  
The headaches, the heartaches, the backaches, the flops  
The sheriff that escorts you out of town  
The opening when your heart beats like a drum  
The closing when the customers won't come  
  
There's no business like show business  
Like no business I know  
You get word the show has started  
That your favorite uncle died at dawn  
Top of that your pa and ma have parted  
You're broken hearted but you go on  
  
There's no people like show people  
They never ever run out of dough  
Yesterday they told you you would not go far  
That night you opened and there you are  
Next day on your dressing room they hung a star  
Let's go on with the show

Hang all the mistletoe  
I'm gonna get to know you better  
This Christmas  
And as we trim the tree  
How much fun it's gonna be together  
This Christmas  
  
Fireside is blazing bright  
We're caroling through the night  
And this Christmas will be  
A very special Christmas for me  
  
Presents and cards are here  
My world is filled with cheer and you  
This Christmas  
And as I look around  
Your eyes outshine the town, they do  
This Christmas  
  
Fireside is blazing bright  
We're caroling through the night  
And this Christmas will be  
A very special Christmas for me

Somewhere, someday  
We'll be close together, wait and see  
Oh, by the way, this time the dream's on me  
  
You'll take my hand  
And you'll look at me adoringly  
But as things stand, this time the dream's on me  
  
It would be fun to be certain that I'm the one  
To know that I at least supply the shoulder you cry upon  
To see you through till you're everything you want to be  
It can't be true, but this time the dream's on me

I'm comin home I done my time now I got to know what is an isn't mine  
If you received my letter  
Telling you I'd soon be free  
Then you'll know just what to do  
If you still want me  
If you still want me  
Tie a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
It's been three long years  
Do you still want me  
If I don't see a ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us  
Put the blame on me  
If I don't see a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
Bus driver please look for me  
'Cause I couldn't bare to see what I might see  
I'm really still in prison  
And my love she holds the key  
A simple yellow ribbon's what I need to set me free  
I wrote and told her please  
Tie a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
It's been three long years  
Do you still want me  
If I don't see a ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
I'll stay on the bus, forget about us  
Put the blame on me  
If I don't see a yellow ribbon  
'Round the ole oak tree  
Now the whole damn bus is cheering  
And I can't believe I see  
A hundred yellow ribbons  
'Round the ole, the old oak tree

I is just what I was,  
And am ain't who I be.  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.  
  
Ax', ya "x," what talks in tongues.  
Say: "never mo', neither me."  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.  
  
Stayin' by my mama's,  
In slippers and pajamas.  
Where there's always somethin' good to eat.  
Bettin' strawberries,  
Honey, and cherries,  
And pecan-pies, oh, so sweet.  
  
With a dew-rag on my brow.  
Jasmine, wysteria and fleur-de-lis.  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.  
  
If you won't work fo' a livin',  
And live life leisurely.  
Pull up a screen po-ch,  
Flop out in a rockin' chair.  
To love the language,  
You got to be born  
On the banks of the Mississippi.

Oh, she may be weary  
Young girls they do get weary  
Wearing that same old shaggy dress, yeah yeah  
But when she gets weary  
Try a little tenderness, yeah yeah  
You know she's waiting  
Just anticipating  
For things that she'll never never never never possess, yeah yeah  
But while she's there waiting, without them  
Try a little tenderness (that's all you gotta do)  
It's not just sentimental, no no no  
She has her grief and care, yeah yeah yeah  
But the soft words they are spoke so gentle, yeah  
It makes it easier, easier to bear, yeah  
You won't regret it, no no  
Some girls they don't forget it  
Love is their only happiness, yeah  
But it's all so easy  
All you gotta do is try, try a little tenderness, yeah  
All you gotta do is man, hold her where you want her  
Squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave her  
Get to her drop drop  
Just try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah  
You got to know how to love her, man, you'll be surprised, man  
You've got to squeeze her, don't tease her, never leave  
You've got to hold her and rub her softly  
Try a little tenderness, ooh yeah yeah yeah  
You've got to rub her gentle man, all you gotta do, no no  
You've got to love her, squeeze her, don't tease her  
Gotta drop nah nah nah drop  
Try a little tenderness, yeah, watch her groove  
You've gotta to know what to do, man  
Take this advice

Maybe it?s much too early in the game  
Ah, but I thought I?d ask you just the same  
What are you doing New Year?s  
New Year?s Eve?  
Wonder whose arms will hold you good and tight  
When it?s exactly twelve o?clock that night  
Welcoming in the New Year  
New Year?s Eve  
Maybe I'm crazy to suppose  
I?d ever be the one you chose  
Out of the thousand invitations  
You receive  
Ah, but in case I stand one little chance  
Here comes the jackpot question in advance

What are you doing New Year?s  
New Year?s Eve?  

In my eyes are valentines  
And easter eggs and new year's wine  
But when my heart finds christmas  
My eyes will shine like new  
  
All the days are kind to me  
But fall too far behind to see  
But when my heart finds christmas  
I hope it finds you too  
  
Let the angels sing around us  
Christmas time is here  
Let our children's love surround us  
Laughing and filled with cheer  
  
My heart told me once before  
To find my dream and search no more  
And when my heart finds christmas  
I hope it finds you too

It seems we stood and talked like this before  
We looked at each other in the same way then  
But I can't remember where or when  
  
The clothes you're wearing are the clothes you wore  
The smile you are smiling you were smiling then  
But I can't remember where or when  
  
Some things that happen for the first time  
Seem to be happening again  
And so it seems that we have met before  
And laughed before and loved before  
But who knows where or when

Somebody was spreading rumors  
'bout better days a comin  
Why was I hummin  
As if I knew  
One and the same  
But I just whispered your name  
  
Somebody was sayin something  
'bout there being an end to tyranny  
But when they asked me  
What would I do...  
If that day came  
I only whispered your name  
  
Everyone got their own opinion  
And protects their own dominion  
No doubt for them it's true  
But I tell them what I really believe  
My only worry is protecting you  
  
No one should ever be lonely  
We'd all find somebody to care  
Ask me if I dare  
To answer who...  
Could carry that flame  
I'd just whisper your name

Sleigh bells ring  
Are you listening  
In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away is the bluebird  
Here to stay is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
We'll say: No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on  
We'll conspire  
As we dream by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with mister snowman  
Until the all the kids knock him down  
  
When it snows  
Ain't it thrilling  
Though your nose gets a chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland

I've travelled many a mile  
And I haven't found a home  
I've travelled many a mile  
And one seed's unsown  
I'll travel another mile  
'til I finally find my own  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
I started with a dream  
But came to a decision  
I started with a dream  
But now I have a mission  
I have a goal  
To see beyond my vision  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
I've got to be strong [shannon]  
To climb the next hill  
I've got to be strong [russell]  
My fate to fulfill  
And from a strength [leroy]  
Stronger than my will  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
In my father's house  
No harsh words are spoken  
In my father's house  
No vows are broken  
In a holy place  
My sould like beams oaken  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
When weary is your world  
Go and spin another  
When weary is your world  
There's heaven to discover  
Here on earth  
We're sister and brother  
With imagination  
We'll get there  
  
And if I stand alone  
To my cause I'm loyal  
If I stand alone  
Either common or royal  
I'm not afraid  
To cross their sea of toil  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
With imagination  
I'll get there  
  
With imagination  
I'll get there
