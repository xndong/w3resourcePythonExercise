Words are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup,  
They slither while they pass, they slip away across the universe.  
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind,  
Possessing and caressing me.  
  
Jai Guru Deva Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes,  
They call me on and on across the universe.  
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box,  
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Sounds of laughter, shades of earth are ringing  
Through my open ears inciting and inviting me.  
Limitless, undying love, which shines around me like a million suns,  
And calls me on and on across the universe.  
  
Jai Guru Deva Om  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
Nothing's gonna change my world,  
Nothing's gonna change my world.  
  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva  
Jai Guru Deva...  

(Jimi Hendrix)  
  
Angel come on down from heaven yesterday  
Stayed with me just long enough to rescue me  
And she told me a story yesterday  
About the love between the moon  
And the deep blue sea  
Then she spread her wings high above me  
And she said she gonna come back tomorrow  
  
And I said  
Fly on by, sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on, my sweet angel  
Tomorrow I will be right by your side  
  
Sure enough, this woman came home to me  
Silver wings, silhouette against a child's own prize  
Oh, angel, she said unto me  
Today is the day for you to rise  
Take my hand, take my hand  
You're gonna rise  
And then, she took me high over yonder  
  
And I said  
Fly on by, sweet angel  
Fly on through the sky  
Fly on, my sweet angel  
Forever I will be right by your side  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, hoo, ooh  
I, uh-huh, I, uh-huh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
I, I, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh

My cheeks were reflecting the longest wavelength  
My fan was folded up and grazing my forehead  
And I kept touching my neck  
To guide your eye to where I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time
alone  
  
My scars were reflecting the mist in your headlights  
I looked like a neon zebra shaking rain off her stripes  
And the rivulets had you riveted  
To the places that I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone  
  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
  
We started out sipping the water  
And now we try to swallow the wave  
And we try not to let those bastards get us down  
We don't worry anymore 'cause we know when the gulf comes we get brave  
After all, look around  
It's happening, it's happening, it's happenin' now  
  
Let's pretend we're eight years old playing hookey  
I'll draw on the wall and you can play U-F-C rookie  
Then we'll grow up  
Take our clothes off  
And you remind me that I wanted you to kiss me when we find some time alone  
  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want  
And then we can do anything we want

The nickel dropped when I was on  
My way beyond the Rubicon  
What did I do?  
And the games that I could handle  
  
And then the ones with a candle  
What can I do?  
I'm a frightened, fickle person,  
Fighting, cryin', kickin', cursin',  
  
What should I do?  
Oooh, after all the folderol  
And hauling over coal stops  
What will I do?  
  
Can't take a good day without a bad one  
Don't feel just to smile until I had one  
Where did I learn?  
I make a fuss about a little thing  
  
The rhyme is losing to the riddling  
Where's the turn?  
I don't want a home  
I go into habits where my habits have a habitat  
  
Why did it turn?  
Oooh, after all the folderol  
And hauling over coal stops  
What did I learn?  
  
I am likely to miss the main event  
If I stop to cry and complain again  
So I will keep a deliberate pace  
Let the damn breeze dry my face  
  
Ooh mister, wait until you see  
What I plan to be  
I've got a plan to demand and it just began  
And if you're right, you'll agree  
  
Here's coming a better version of me  
Here's coming a better version of me  
Here comes a better version of me

When you're weary, feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes, I will dry them all  
I'm on your side when times get rough  
And friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
When you're down and out  
When you're on the street  
When evening falls so hard  
I will comfort you  
I'll take your part  
When darkness comes  
And pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
Sail on silver girl  
Sail on by  
Your time has come to shine  
All your dreams are on their way  
See how they shine  
Oh, if you need a friend  
I'm sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind

Won't do no good to hold no seance  
What's gone is gone and you can't bring it back around  
Won't do no good to hold no searchlight  
You can't illuminate what time has anchored down  
  
Oh, honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
I've gone away  
  
Won't do no good to sing no love song  
No sound could simulate the presence of a man  
Won't do no good asking no questions  
Your divination should acquaint you with the plan  
  
Oh, honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
  
[Chorus]  
I feel for you boy,  
Is decaying in front of me  
Like the carrion of a murdered prey  
And all I want is to save you honey  
Or the strength to walk away  
  
Won't do no good to go no distance  
The space between us is a boundless as the dark  
Won't do no good to throw no fist, babe  
You can't intimidate me back into your arms  
  
'Cause, honey I've gone away  
Honey I've gone away  
I've gone away  
  
I feel for you boy,  
Is decaying right in front of me  
Like the carrion of a murdered prey  
And all I want is to save you honey  
Or the strength to walk away  
  
[Chorus: x3]

I've been a bad, bad girl  
I've been careless with a delicate man  
And it's a sad, sad world  
When a girl will break a boy just because she can  
  
Don't you tell me to deny it  
I've done wrong and I want to suffer for my sins  
I've come to you 'cause I need guidance to be true  
And I just don't know where I can begin  
  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal  
And I need to be redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love  
  
Heaven help me for the way I am  
Save me from these evil deeds before I get them done  
I know tomorrow brings the consequence at hand  
But I keep living this day like the next will never come  
  
Oh help me but don't tell me to deny it  
I've got to cleanse myself of all these lies 'till I'm good enough for him  
I've got a lot to lose and I'm bettin' high so I'm begging you  
Before it ends just tell me where to begin  
  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal  
And I need to be redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love  
  
Let me know the way  
Before there's hell to pay  
Give me room to lay the law and let me go  
I've got to make a play  
To make my lover stay  
So what would an angel say the devil wants to know  
  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal  
And I need to be redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love  
  
What I need is a good defense  
'Cause I'm feeling like a criminal  
And I need to be redeemed  
To the one I've sinned against  
Because he's all I ever knew of love

I guess I just must be a daredevil  
I don't feel anything until I smash it up  
I'm caught on the cold, caught on the hot  
Not so with the warmer lot  
And all I want's a confidante  
To help me laugh it off  
  
And don't let me ruin me  
I may need a chaperone  
  
Say I'm an airplane  
And the gashes I got from my heartbreak  
Make the slots and the flaps upon my wing  
And I use them to give me lip  
Hip hip for the lift  
Hip hip for the drag  
I want them all in my bag  
Oh give me anything and I'll turn it into a gift  
  
But don't let me ruin me  
I may need a chaperone  
  
Seek me out  
Look at, look at, look at, look at me  
I'm all the fishes in the sea  
Wake me up  
Give me, give me, give me what you got  
In your mind, in the middle of the night  
  
Maybe you let me look out for you  
Protect that I found in you  
And never let it starve  
Then that way, you let me stay  
Skirt in my the skirt like I want to  
And I will try hard to hold onto you with open arms  
  
But don't let me ruin me  
I may need a chaperone

Every single night  
I endure the flight  
Of little wings of white flame  
Butterflies in my brain  
These ideas of mine  
Percolate the mind  
Trickle down my spine  
Swarm the belly, swelling to a blaze  
That's where the pain comes in  
Like a second skeleton  
Trying to fit beneath the skin  
I can't fit the feelings in, no  
Every single night's alright with my brain  
  
What'd I say to her  
Why'd I say it to her  
What does she think of me  
That I'm not what I ought to be  
That I'm what I try not to be  
It's got to be somebody else's fault  
I can't get caught  
If what I am is what I am, 'cause I does what I does  
Then brother, get back, 'cause my breast's gonna bust open  
The rib is the shell and the heart is the yolk and  
I just made a meal for us both to choke on  
Every single night's a fight with my brain  
  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
  
So I'm gonna try to be still now  
Gonna renounce the mill a little while and  
If we had a double king-sized bed  
We could move in it and I'd soon forget  
That what I am is what I am 'cause I does what I does  
And maybe I'd relax, let my breast just bust open  
My heart's made of parts of all that surround me  
And that's why the devil just can't get around me  
Every single night's alright, every single night's a fight  
And every single fight's alright with my brain  
  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything  
I just want to feel everything

I certainly haven't been shopping for any new shoes,  
And I certainly haven't been spreading myself around.  
I still only travel by foot and by foot it's a slow climb.  
But, I'm good at being uncomfortable,  
So I can't stop changing all the time.  
  
I noticed that my opponent is always on the go,  
And won't go slow so as not to focus and I notice.  
You're trying with any guy as long as they go fast,  
From whence he came.  
But, he's no good at being uncomfortable,  
So he can't staying exactly the same.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.  
  
I sing to you to seek a new disaster every day.  
You deem me duped to clean my view and be at peace and lay.  
I'm in the loop, I'm into moving my own way.  
And say I've been getting along for long before you came into the play.  
I am the baby of the family, it happened so  
Everybody came and wears the sheep's clothes while they chaperone.  
Curious, you're looking down your nose at me while you appease,  
Courteous to try and help but let me set your mind at ease.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.  
  
Do I so worry you?  
No need to hurry to my side.  
That's very kind,  
But it's to no avail,  
I don't want the veil,  
Everything will be just fine.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.  
  
If there was a better way to go, then it would find me.  
I can't help it the road just rolls out behind me.  
Be kind to me, or treat me mean.  
I'll make the most of it,  
I'm an extraordinary machine.

It's not time to make a change,  
Just relax, take it easy.  
You're still young, that's your fault,  
There's so much you have to know.  
Find a girl, settle down,  
If you want you can marry.  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.  
  
I was once like you are now  
And I know that it's not easy,  
To be calm when you've found  
Something going on.  
But take your time, think a lot,  
Why, think of everything you've got.  
For you will still be here tomorrow  
But your dreams may not.  
  
How can I try to explain  
When I do he turns away again  
It's always been the same, same old story.  
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen.  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  
I know I have to go.  
  
It's not time to make a change,  
Just sit down, take it slowly.  
You're still young, that's your fault,  
There's so much you have to go through.  
Find a girl, settle down,  
If you want you can marry.  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.  
  
All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it.  
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me.  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  
I know I have to go.

Frosty the Snowman  
Was a jolly happy soul  
With a corn-cob pipe and a button nose  
And two eyes made out of coal  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Is a fairy tale they say  
He was made of snow  
But the children know  
How he came to life one day  
  
There must have been some magic  
In that old silk hat they found  
For when they placed it on his head  
He began to dance around  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Was alive as he could be  
And the children say  
He could laugh and play  
Just the same as you and me  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Knew the sun was hot that day  
So he said, "Let's run  
And we'll have some fun  
Now before I melt away"  
  
Down to the village  
With a broomstick in his hand  
Running here and there  
All around the square  
Saying, "Catch me if you can"  
  
He led them down  
The streets of town  
Right to the traffic cop  
And he only paused a moment  
When he heard them holler, "Stop!"  
  
Frosty the Snowman  
Had to hurry on his way  
But he waved goodbye  
Saying, "Don't you cry  
I'll be back again some day"

How many times do I have to say  
To get away-get gone  
Flip your shit past another lasses  
Humble dwelling  
You got your game, made your shot  
And you got away with a lot  
But I'm not turned on  
So put away that meat your selling  
'Cause I do know what's good for me  
  
And I've done what I could for you  
But you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting  
Singing again, sing, sing again  
How can I deal with this,  
If he won't get with this  
Am I gonna heal from this  
He won't admit to it  
Nothing to figure out  
I gotta get him out  
It's about time the truth was out  
That he don't give a shit about me  
  
How many times can it escalate  
'Til it elevates to place I can't breathe  
And I must decide, if you must deride  
That I'm much obliged to up and go  
I'll idealize ,  
Then realize that it's no sacrifice  
Because the price is paid  
And there's nothing left to grieve  
Fuckin' go  
  
'Cause I've done what I could for you  
But you're not benefiting, and yet I'm sitting  
Singing again, sing, sing again  
How can I deal with this,  
If he won't get with this  
Am I gonna heal from this  
He won't admit to it  
Nothing to figure out  
I gotta get him out  
It's about time the truth was out  
That he don't give a shit about me

One man, he'd disappoint me  
He'd give me the gouge and he take my glee  
Now every other man I see  
Remind me of the  
One man who disappointed me  
  
Wait 'til I get him back  
He won't have a back to scratch  
Yeah, keep turning that chin  
And you will see my face  
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch  
  
So I say "and on I go"  
To another one who disappoint me so, oh oh  
  
The next one up  
A contemptible snob  
He lived to put things in their place  
He did a commendable job  
He put himself so low  
He can hardly even look me in the face  
  
Wait 'til I get him back  
He won't have a back to scratch  
Yeah, keep turning that chin  
And you will see my face  
As I figure how to kill what I cannot catch  
  
Oh, he made my blood just burn  
I flipped so far  
I thought that I would not return  
  
But the last one I had  
Who was getting my hopes up  
I might have been a little fast to dismiss  
I think he let me down when he didn't disappoint me  
He didn't always guess right but he usually got my gist  
  
So wait til I get him back  
I'm gonna bring him home  
And I'll watch him unpack  
He keep turning that chin  
And you will see my face  
Is fixed on the one  
I'm gonna get back  
  
I'm gonna get him back  
I am  
I'm gonna get him back  
I really am  
  
I'm gonna get him back  
I...  
I'm gonna get him back  
I...  
  
I'm gonna get him back  
Gonna get him back...

So be it, I'm your crowbar  
If that's what I am so far  
Until you get out of this mess  
And I will pretend  
That I don't know of your sins  
Until you are ready to confess  
But all the time, all the time  
I'll know, I'll know  
  
And you can use my skin  
To bury your secrets in  
And I will settle you down  
And at my own suggestion  
I will ask no questions  
While I do my thing in the background  
But all the time all the time  
I'll know I'll know  
  
Baby-I can't help you out,  
While she's still around  
For the time being,  
I'm being patient  
And amidst this bitterness  
If you'll just consider this  
Even if it don't make sense  
All the time give it time  
And when the crowd becomes your burden  
And you've early closed your curtains,  
I'll wait by the backstage door  
While you try to find  
The lines to speak your mind  
And pry it open, hoping for a encore  
And if it gets too late, for me to wait  
For you to find you love me, and tell me so  
It's ok, don't need to say it

I don't buy your true life stories  
'cause I've seen the way you lie  
but I don't mind the things you tell me  
because I know we'll say anything to get by  
  
but when we're together  
somehow I feel better  
my disease always tricks me  
I believe you can fix me  
  
you're insane  
I love the drama  
tell the truth  
you love it too, I know you do?  
  
reason strikes  
we fight and break up  
'cause it seems  
the easiest thing to do  
  
but when I don't get your call  
I go into withdrawal  
you consume every thought  
but if you called I would tell you to get lost  
  
I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a  
I need you, I need you like a  
drug  
  
it turns me on  
to say "I love you"  
but deep inside I know  
it's lust, not love at all  
  
one day we will leave each other  
but we pretend the end's not inevitable  
I require protection from my own obsession  
in the object of you  
  
one day I will rise above you  
  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a...  
  
until then we'll stay together  
I guess things could be much worse  
I guess things could be much better  
but I don't really want to write another verse  
  
'cause when we're together  
somehow I feel better  
my disease always tricks me  
I believe you can fix me  
  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a  
I need you, I need you like a drug  
I need you, I need you like a drug

Electricity, eye to eye.  
Hey don't I know you? I can't speak.  
Stripped my senses on the spot,  
I've never been defenseless,  
I can't even make sense of this.  
You speak and I don't hear a word.  
  
What would happen if we kissed?  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust,  
Spontaneously combust  
  
The room is spinning out of control.  
You act like you didn't notice, brushed my hand.  
Forbidden fruit, ring on my finger.  
You're such a moral mortal man.  
Would you throw it away? No question.  
Will I pretend I'm innocent?  
  
What would happen if we kissed?  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth, lust to lust,  
Spontaneously combust  
What would happen if we kissed?  
  
Ahhhh...  
Oh  
Ahhhh...  
  
I struggle with myself again  
Quickly the wall, I'm crumbling  
Don't know if I can turn away  
  
What would happen if we kissed?  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth.  
If we kissed,  
Would your tongue slip past my lips?  
Would you run away?  
Would you stay?  
Or would I melt into you?  
Mouth to mouth.  
If we kissed.  
Oehh-oh  
If we kissed.  
Oehh-oh...

Jonathan, call again  
Take me to Coney Island  
Take me on the train  
Kiss me while I calculate  
And calibrate and heaven's sakes  
Don't make me explain  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
  
Jonathan, anything  
And anyone that you have done  
Has gotta be alright with me  
If she's part of  
The reason you are how you are  
She's alright with me  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
  
You like to captain  
A capsized ship  
But I like watching you live  
  
You like to captain  
A capsized ship  
But I like watching you live  
  
Jonathan, call again  
Take me to Coney Island  
Take me on the train  
Kiss me while I calculate  
And calibrate and heaven's sakes  
Don't make me explain  
  
Just tolerate my little fist  
Tugging on your forest chest  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything  
I don't wanna talk about  
I don't wanna talk about anything

(Bill Withers)  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
I can hear a thump thumping in my head  
Mmm when I'm kissing my love  
I close my eyes and see  
A pretty city  
With a million flowerbeds  
  
Ah I can hear the angels sing  
Songs that only angels sing  
He's such a pretty thing  
That I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
Mmm ah when I'm kissing my love  
I feel the blood pumping in my veins  
Mmm when I'm kissing my love  
He's such a tender sender  
With a sweet young frame  
  
Oh he's so good at what he does  
All I wanna do is kiss and hug  
He's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
Ah when I'm kissing my love  
I feel the blood pumping in my veins  
Oh when I'm kissing my love  
He's such a tender sender  
With a sweet young frame  
  
Oh now he's so good at what he does  
All I wanna do is kiss and hug  
He's got me in love  
And I can feel my heart  
Just a thumping and a skipping  
When I'm kissing my love  
  
When I'm kissing my love  
When he's kissing me  
(repeat chorus)

All my bags are packed I'm ready to go  
I'm standing here outside your door  
I hate to wake you up to say goodbye  
but the dawn is breaking, its early morn  
the taxi's waiting he's blowin' his horn  
Already, I'm so lonesome I could die.  
  
(Chorus)  
So kiss me and smile for me.  
Tell me that you'll wait for me.  
Hold me like you'll never let me go.  
  
Cause I'm leaving on a jet plane,  
I dont know when I'll be back again.  
Oh babe I hate to go.  
  
There's so many times I've let you down,  
so many times I've been around, but  
I don't know, they don't mean a thing.  
Every place I go I think of you,  
every song I sing, I sing for you.  
When I come back I'll wear your wedding ring.  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Now the time has come to leave you,  
one more time oh let me kiss you...  
Now close your eyes and I'll be on my way.  
Dream about the days to come  
when I wont have to leave alone  
about the times that I wont have to say...  
  
(Chorus)  
  
And I'm leaving on a jet plane  
don't know when I'll be back again.  
Oh babe I hate to go  
  
but I'm leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
leaving on a jet plane  
on a jet plane.

You made your, made your overtures  
When you were a chauven'd over-toned mutt  
And I was still a dewy petal  
Rather than a moribund slut  
  
My love wrecked you  
You're back to twirl your skirt at the palace  
It hurt more than it ought to hurt  
I went to work to cultivate a callous  
  
And now I'm hard, too hard to know  
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no  
Tears calcify in my tummy  
Fears go inside the bottle  
How can I ask anyone to love me  
When all I do is beg to be left alone  
  
Oh and I tried to love  
And I can love the same man and the same bed and the same city  
But not in the same room it's a pity but oh  
It never bothered me before  
Not 'til this guy  
What a guy  
Oh, God, what a good guy  
And I can't even enjoy him  
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know  
  
I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no  
Tears calcify in my tummy  
Fears go inside the bottle  
How can I ask anyone to love me  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left  
Alone  
Alone  
Alone  
  
My ills are articulate  
My woes are granular  
The ants weigh more than the elephants  
Nothing, nothing is manageable  
So couldn't we skip the valedictories  
I can see your door there  
Shut it and forget my number  
'Cause I'm hard, too hard to know  
  
Oh I don't cry when I'm sad anymore, no no  
Tears calcify in my tummy  
Fears go inside the bottle  
How can I ask anyone to love me  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left  
When all I do is beg to be left alone

Love ridden, I've looked at you  
With the focus I gave to my birthday candles  
I've wished on the lidded blue flame  
Under your brow  
And baby, I wished for you  
Nobody sees when you are lying in your bed  
And I want to crawl in with you  
But I cry instead  
I want your warm, but it will only make  
Me colder when it's over  
So I can't tonight, baby  
  
No, not "baby" anymore-if I need you  
I'll just use your simple name  
Only kisses on the cheek from now on  
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave  
  
My hand won't hold you down no more  
The path is clear to follow through  
I stood too long in the way of the door  
And now I'm giving up on you  
  
No, not "baby" any more-if I need you  
I'll just use your simple name  
Only kisses on the cheek from now on  
And in a little while, we'll only have to wave

You'll never see  
The courage I know  
Its colors' richness  
Won't appear within your view  
I'll never glow,  
The way that you glow  
Your presence dominates the judgments made on you  
  
But as the scenery grows,  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I understand what I am still to proud to mention  
-to you  
  
You'll say you understand  
But you don't understand  
You'll say you'd never give up  
Seeing eye to eye  
But never is a promise  
And you can't afford to lie  
  
You'll never touch  
These things that I hold  
The skin of my emotions  
Lies beneath my own  
You'll never feel  
The heat of this soul  
My fever burns me deeper than I've ever shown  
To you  
  
You'll say don't fear your dreams  
It's easier than it seems  
You'll say you'd never let me fall  
From hopes so high  
But never is a promise  
And you can't afford to lie  
  
You'll never live the life that I live  
I'll never live the life  
That wakes me in the night  
You'll never hear the message I give  
You'll say it looks as though I might  
Give up this fight  
  
But as the scenery grows,  
I see in different lights  
The shades and shadows  
Undulate in my perception  
My feelings swell and stretch  
I see from greater heights  
I realize what I am now too smart to mention  
To you  
  
You'll say you understand,  
You'll never understand  
I'll say I'll never wake up  
Knowing how or why  
I don't know what to believe in  
You don't know who I am  
You'll say I need appeasing  
When I start to cry  
But never is a promise  
And I'll never need a lie

The early cars  
Already are  
Drawing deep breaths past my door  
And last night's phrases  
Sick with lack of basis  
Are still writhing on my floor  
  
And it doesn't seem fair  
That your wicked words should work  
In holding me down  
No, it doesn't seem right  
  
To take information  
Given at close range  
For the gag  
And the bind  
And the ammunition round  
  
Conversation once colored by esteem  
Became dialogue as a diagram of a play for pun  
Took a vacation, my palate got clean  
Now I could taste your agenda  
While you're spitting your cud  
  
And it doesn't make sense  
I should fall for the kingcraft of a meritless crown  
No, it doesn't seem right  
To take information  
  
Given at close range  
For the gag  
And the bind  
And the ammunition round  
  
This is not about love  
'Cause I am not in love  
In fact I can't stop falling out  
  
This is not about love  
'Cause I am not in love  
In fact I can't stop falling out  
I miss that stupid ache  
  
What is this posture  
I have to stare at  
That's what he said when I'm sittin' up straight  
Change the name of the game 'cause he lost  
  
And he knew he was wrong but he knew it too late  
But I'm not being fair  
'Cause I chose to listen to that filthy mouth  
But I'd like to choose right  
  
Take all the things that I've said that he stole  
Put 'em in a sack  
Swing 'em over my shoulder  
Turn on my heels  
  
Step out of this sight  
Try to live in a lovelier life (lie?)  
  
This is not about love  
'Cause I am not in love  
In fact I can't stop falling out  
  
This is not about love  
'Cause I am not in love  
In fact i can't stop falling out  
I miss that stupid ache

I'm undecided about you again  
I can be right that you're not here  
It's double sided 'cause I ruined it all  
But also saved myself  
By never believing you dear  
Everything good I deem too good to be true  
Everything else is just a bore  
Everything I have to look forward to  
Has a pretty painful and very imposing before  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
I have too been playing with fifty-two cards  
Just 'cause I play so far from my vest  
Whatever I've got, I've got no reason to guard  
What could I do but spend my best  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
And after waiting, fighting patiently on my knees  
All the other stuff tired itself out first, not me  
And in its wake appeared the touch and call of a different breed  
One of the steps is getting wise and got me there and then got me  
And what a thing to know what could be instead  
Oh what a blessed curse to see  
Took the agenda from its place in my bed  
Made a merry paramour of me  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Saying there's nothing to it  
Then lettin' it go by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards  
Oh sailor why'd you do it  
What'd you do that for  
Given the eyes to view it  
As it goes by the boards  

What you did to me made me  
See myself something different  
Though I try to talk sense to myself  
But I just won't listen  
  
Won't you go away  
Turned yourself in  
You're no good at confession  
Before the image that you burned me in  
Tries to teach you a lesson  
  
What you did to me made me see myself somethin' awful  
A voice once stentorian is now again meek and muffled  
It took me such a long time to get back up the first time you did it  
I spent all I had to get it back, and now it seems I've been outbidded  
  
My peace and quiet was stolen from me  
When I was looking with calm affection  
You were searching out my imperfections  
  
What wasted unconditional love  
On somebody  
Who doesn't believe in this stuff  
  
You came up on me like a hypnic jerk  
When I was just about settled  
And when it counts you recoil  
With the cryptic word you even love belittling  
  
Oh what a cold and common old way to go  
I was feeding on the need for you to know me  
Devastated at the rate you feel below me  
  
What wasted unconditional love  
On somebody  
Who doesn't believe in this life  
  
Oh, well

All my life is on me now, hail the pages turning  
And the future's on the bound,  
Hell don't know my fury  
You're all I need, you're all I need  
You're all I need-and maybe some faith would  
Do me good  
  
I don't know what I'm doing, don't know should I  
Change my mind, I can't decide, there's too many  
Variations to consider  
No thing I do don't do no thing but bring me  
More to do,  
It's true, I do imbue my blue unto myself,  
I make it bitter  
Baby, lay your head on my lap one more time  
Tell me you belong to me  
Baby say that it's all gonna be alright  
I believe that it isn't

Pale September  
I wore the time like a dress, that year  
The autumn days swung soft around me  
Like cotton on my skin  
  
But as the embers of the summer  
Lost their breath and disappeared  
My heart went cold  
And only hollow rhythms resounded from within  
  
But then he rose, brilliant as the moon in full  
And sank in the burrows of my keep  
  
[Chorus]  
All my armor falling down,  
In a pile at my feet  
And my winter giving way to warm  
As I'm singing him to sleep  
  
He goes along just as a water lily  
Gentle on the surface of his thoughts, his body floats  
Unweighed down by passion or intensity  
Yet unaware of the depth upon, which he coasts  
And he finds a home in me  
For what misfortune sows  
He knows my touch will reap  
  
[Chorus: x3]

I was staring at the sky  
Just looking for a star  
To pray on or wish on or something like that  
I was having a sweet fix  
Of a daydream of a boy  
Whose reality I knew was a hopeless to be had  
But then the dove of hope began its downward slope  
And I believed for a moment  
That my chances were approaching to be grabbed  
But as it came down near  
So did a weary tear  
I thought it was a bird but it was just a paper bag  
  
Hunger hurts and I want him so bad, oh it kills  
'Cause I know I'm a mess he don't want to clean up  
I've gotta fold 'cause these hands are too shaky to hold  
Hunger hurts, starving works when it costs too much to love  
  
And I went crazy again today  
Looking for a strand to climb  
Looking for a little hope  
Baby said he couldn't stay  
Wouldn't put his lips to mine  
And a fail to kiss is a fail to cope  
I said honey I don't feel so good  
Don't feel justified  
Come on put a little love here in my void  
He said it's all in your head  
I said so's everything but he didn't get it  
I thought he was a man but he was just a little boy  
  
Hunger hurts  
  
Hunger hurts  
  
Hunger hurts

Oh, the periphery  
They throw good parties there  
Those peripheral idiots  
Always have a bite to bear  
Bear it if you can  
If you really want to  
  
Go to the periphery  
Have them celebrate your name  
Have them forge you a pedigree and then you'll be  
Left to run the races lame  
Run if you want  
If you think it's worth it  
But not with me  
  
'Cause I don't appreciate  
People who  
Don't appreciate  
All that loving must've been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I don't even like you anymore at all  
  
Oh, the periphery  
I lost another one there  
He found a prettier girl than me  
With a more even-tempered air  
And if he wants her, he should get her  
'Cause I think he thinks she's worth it  
And maybe they'll move from the periphery  
By themselves, or on a plot of land  
And I'll care in a different capacity, I'll just be  
Hoping he makes a good family man  
And if he finds himself yearning  
For his throne on the silly side  
Nothing wrong as long as he's learning  
Besides, you can take it up with his brethren  
Or with his bride, just not with me  
  
'Cause I don't appreciate  
People who  
Don't appreciate  
All that loving must've been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I don't even like you anymore at all  
  
All that loving must've been lacking something  
If I got bored trying to figure you out  
You let me down  
I don't even like you anymore at all  
  
Oh, the periphery  
Oh, the periphery  
Oh, the periphery  
Oh, the periphery  
Stay away  
Stay away  
Away, away  
Stay away, away

Bells will be ringing the glad, glad news  
Oh what a christmas to have the blues  
My baby's gone (my baby's gone) I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
  
Choirs will be singing silent night  
Those christmas carols by candlelight  
Please come home for christmas (please come home)  
Please come home for christmas (please come home)  
If not for christmas by new year's night  
  
Friends and relations send salutations  
Just as sure as the stars shine above (yes they do)  
This is christmas, christmas my dear  
The time of year to be with the one that you love  
  
Then won't you tell me, you'll never more roam  
Christmas and new year (christmas and new year's)  
Will find you at home  
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief or pain  
I'll be happy (happy) that it's christmas once again.

Please please please  
No more melodies  
They lack impact, they're petty  
They've been made up already  
Please please please  
No more maladies  
I'm so tired of crying  
You'd think I was a siren  
But me and everybody's on the sad same team  
And you can hear our sad brain screaming  
  
Give us something familiar  
Something similar  
To what we know already  
That will keep us steady  
Steady  
Steady going nowhere  
  
Please please please  
No apologies  
At best they buy you time  
Until you next step out of line  
Please please please  
No more remedies  
My method is uncertain  
It's a mess but it's working  
And maybe if you tried it out  
You won't like it when you're crying out  
  
Give us something familiar  
Something similar  
To what we know already  
That will keep us steady  
Steady, steady  
Steady going nowhere

Steady, steady  
Steady going nowhere

Heaven please send to all mankind,  
Understanding and peace and mind.  
But if it is not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love, someone to love.  
  
Show the world how to get along,  
And peace will enter, when hate is gone.  
But if it's not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love,  
Please send me someone to love.  
  
I lie awake nights, and ponder a world of trouble  
And my answer is always the same.  
That when this man put an end to this damnable sin.  
Hate will put the world in a flame, what a shame  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
Just because i'm, in misery  
I don't beg for no sympathy  
But if it is not asking too much,  
Please send me someone to love,  
Please send me someone to love.

(Recited before performing Sleep To Dream)  
  
"When the pawn hits the conflicts he thinks like a king  
What he knows throws the blows when he goes to the fight  
And he'll win the whole thing before he enters the ring  
There's nobody to batter when your mind is your might  
So when you go solo you hold your own hand  
And remember that depth is the greatest of heights  
And if you know where you stand then you know where to land  
And if you fall it won't matter ''cause you know that you're right"

Come with me  
And you'll be  
In a world of  
Pure imagination  
Take a look  
And you'll see  
Into your imagination  
  
We'll begin with a spin  
Traveling in a world of my creation  
What we'll see will defy explanation  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it  
  
There is no life I know  
To compare with pure imagination  
Living there, you'll be free  
If you truly wish to be  
  
If you want to view paradise  
Simply look around and view it  
Anything you want to, do it  
Want to change the world?  
There's nothing to it

I don't understand about complementary colors  
And what they say  
Side by side they both get white  
Together they both get gray  
  
But he's been pretty much yellow  
And I've been cryin' blue  
But all I can see is  
Red, red, red, red, red now  
What am I to do  
  
I don't understand about  
Diamonds and why men buy them  
What's so impressive about a diamond  
Except the mining  
  
And it's dangerous work  
Trying to get to you too  
And I think if I didn't have to  
Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill, kill myself doing it  
Maybe I wouldn't listen so much to you  
  
I've been watching all the time  
And I still can't find the track  
And I want to know is it okay  
Is it just fine  
Was it my fault  
Is it my lack  
  
I don't understand about  
The weather outside  
The harbinger to the words  
That somebody lied  
  
There's solace a bit for submitting  
To the fitfully cryptically true  
What's happened has happened  
What's coming is already on its way  
With a role for me to play  
  
I don't understand  
I'll never understand  
But I'm trying to understand  
There's nothing else I can do

'Member when we argued on the concept of regret?  
You were an expert even then but not me, not yet  
Now all you gotta do's remind me that we met  
And there ya got me, that's how you got me, taught me to regret  
  
'Member how I asked you why are you so mean?  
You didn't know how to yet to bein' seen  
I tried to be your friend, you made me seem so ?  
And there ya got me, that's how you got me, ya taught me to be mean  
  
I ran out of white dove feathers  
To soak up the hot piss that comes through your mouth  
Every time you address me  
  
Oh I ran out of white dove feathers  
To soak up the hot piss that comes through your mouth  
Every time you address me  
  
'Member when I was so sick and you didn't believe me?  
Then you got sick too and guess who took care of you?  
You hated that, didn't you, didn't you?  
Now when you look at me, you're condemned to see  
The monster your mother made you to be  
And there ya got me, that's how you got free, you got rid of me  
  
And now I ran out of white dove feathers  
To soak up the hot piss that comes through your mouth  
Every time you address me  
  
Oh I ran out of white dove feathers  
To soak up the hot piss that comes through your mouth  
Every time you address me  
  
Alone  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone, leave me alone  
Leave me alone, leave me alone  
Alone

I sense there's something in the wind  
That seems like tragedy's at hand  
And though I'd like to stand by him  
Can't shake this feeling that I have  
The worst is just around the bend  
  
And does he notice my feelings for him?  
And will he see how much he means to me?  
I think it's not to be  
  
What will become of my dear friend  
Where will his actions lead us then?  
Although I'd like to join the crowd  
In their enthusiastic cloud  
Try as I may, it doesn't last  
  
And will we ever end up together?  
No, I think not, it's never to become  
For I am not the one  
  
And will we ever end up together?  
No, I think not, it's never to become  
For I am not the one

Once my lover, now my friend.  
What a cruel thing to pretend.  
What a cunning way to condescend.  
Once my lover, and now my friend.  
  
Oh, you creep up like the clouds.  
And you set my soul at ease.  
Then you let your love abound,  
And you bring me to my knees.  
  
Oh, it's evil, babe, the way you let your grace enrapture me.  
When well you know, I'd be insane  
To ever let that dirty game recapture me.  
You made me a Shadowboxer, baby.  
  
I want to be ready for what you do.  
I've been swinging all around me  
"'Cause I don't know when you're gonna make your move.  
Oh, your gaze is dangerous.  
  
And you fill your space so sweet.  
If I let you get to close,  
You'll set your spell on me.  
So darlin', I just want to say  
  
Just in case I don't come through,  
I was on to every play  
I just wanted you.  
Oh, it's so evil, my love.  
  
The way you've no reverence to my concern.  
So I'll be sure to stay wary of you, love.  
To save the pain  
Of once my flame, and twice my burn.

Sitting here in Limbo  
Waiting for the tide turn.  
Yeah, now, sitting here in Limbo,  
So many things I've got to learn.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Waiting for the dice to roll.  
Yeah, now, sitting here in Limbo,  
Still got some time to search my soul.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
  
I don't know where life will take me,  
But I know where I have been.  
I don't know what life will show me,  
But I know what I have seen.  
Tried my hand at love and friendship,  
That is past and gone.  
And now it's time to move along.  
  
Sitting here in Limbo  
Like a bird ain't got a song.  
Yeah, I'm sitting here in Limbo  
And I know it won't be long  
'Til I make my getaway, now.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
  
I don't know where life will take me,  
But I know where I have been.  
I don't know what life will show me,  
But I know what I have seen.  
Tried my hand at love and friendship,  
That is past and gone.  
And now it's time to move along.  
  
Gonna lead me on now.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.  
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.  
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.  
Sitting in Limbo, Limbo, Limbo.  
Meanwhile, they're putting up a resistance,  
But I know that my faith will lead me on.

I tell you how I feel but you don't care  
I say tell me the truth but you don't dare  
You say love is a hell you cannot bear  
And I say give me mine back and go there  
For all I care  
  
I got my feet on the ground and I don't go to sleep to dream  
You got your head in the clouds and you're not at all what you seem  
This mind this body and this voice cannot be stifled by your deviant ways  
So don't forget what I told you don't come around I got my own hell to raise  
  
I have never been so insulted in all my life  
I could swallow the seas to wash down all this pride  
First you run like a fool just to be at my side  
And now you run like a fool but you just run to hide  
I can't abide  
  
I got my feet on the ground  
  
Don't make it a big deal don't be so sensitive  
We're not playing a game anymore you don't have to be defensive  
  
Don't you plead me your case don't bother to explain  
Don't even show me your face 'cause it's a crying shame  
Just go back to the rock from under which you came  
Take the sorrows you gave and all the stakes you claim  
And don't forget to blame  
  
I got my feet on the ground  
  
I got my feet on the ground

You moved like honey in my dream last night  
Yeah, some old fires were burning  
You came near to me and you endeared to me  
But you couldn't quite discern me  
  
Does that scare you? I'll let you run away  
But your heart will not oblige you  
You'll remember me like a melody  
Yeah, I'll haunt the world inside you  
  
And my big secret-gonna win you over  
Slow like honey, heavy with mood  
  
I'll let you see me, I'll covet your regard  
I'll invade your demeanor  
And you'll yield to me like a scent in the breeze  
And you'll wonder what it is about me  
  
It's my big secret-keeping you coming  
Slow like honey, heavy with mood  
  
Though dreams can be deceiving  
Like faces are to hearts  
They serve for sweet relieving  
When fantasy and reality lie too far apart  
  
So I stretch myself across, like a bridge  
And I pull you to the edge  
And stand there waiting  
Trying to attain  
The end to satisfy the story  
Shall I release you?  
Must I release you?  
As I rise to meet my glory  
  
But my big secret  
Gonna hover over your life  
Gonna keep you reaching  
When I'm gone like yesterday  
When I'm high like heaven  
When I'm strong like music  
'Cause I'm slow like honey  
And heavy with mood

Days like this,  
I don't know what to do with myself  
All day-and all night  
I wander the halls along the walls  
And under my breath  
I say to myself  
I need fuel-to take flight  
  
And there's to much going on  
But it's calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
  
Is that why they call me a sullen girl-sullen girl  
They don't know  
I used to sail the deep and tranquil sea  
But he washed me ashore  
And he took my pearl  
And left an empty shell of me  
  
And there's too much going on  
But it's calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
Under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion  
It's calm under the waves  
In the blue of my oblivion

Darling, give me your absence tonight  
Take the shade from the canvas  
And leave me the white  
Let me sink in the silence that echoes inside  
And don't bother leaving the light on  
'Cause I suddenly feel like a different person  
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion  
And I ran my hand o'er a strange inversion  
A vacancy that just did not belong  
The child is gone  
  
Honey help me out of this mess  
I'm a stranger to myself  
But don't reach for me, I'm too far away  
I don't want to talk 'cause there's nothing left to say  
  
So my darling  
Give me your absence tonight  
Take all of your sympathy and leave it outside  
'Cause there's no kind of loving  
That can make this all right  
I'm trying to find a place I belong  
And I suddenly feel like a different person  
From the roots of my soul come a gentle coercion  
And I ran my hand over a strange inversion  
As the darkness turns into the dawn  
The child is gone  
The child is gone

I lie in an early bed  
Thinking late thoughts  
Waiting for the black to replace my blue  
I do not struggle in your web  
Because it was my aim to get caught  
But daddy longlegs  
I feel that I'm finally growing weary  
Of waiting to be consumed by you  
  
Give me the first taste  
Let it begin, heaven can not wait forever  
Darling just start the chase  
I'll let you win  
But you must make the endeavor  
  
Oh, your love give me a heart contusion  
Adagio breezes fill my skin with sudden red  
Your hungry flirt borders intrusion  
I'm building memories on things we have not said  
Full is not heavy as empty,  
Not nearly my love,  
Not nearly my love  
Not nearly  
  
Give me the first taste  
Let it begin, heaven cannot wait forever  
Darling just start the chase  
I'll let you win  
But you must make the endeavor

I wouldn't know what to do with another chance  
If you gave it to me  
I couldn't take the embrace of a real romance  
It'd race right through me  
I'm much better off the way things are  
Much much better off, better of by far, by far  
I wouldn't know what to say to a gentle voice  
It'd roll right past me  
And if you chalk it up you'll see  
I don't really have a choice  
So don't even ask me  
I'm much beter off, the way tings are  
Much much better off, better by far  
  
So keep on calling me names, keep on , keep on  
And I'll keep kicking the crap 'til it's gone  
And I'll keep on killing,  
You could get me to settle  
And as soon as I settle,  
I bet I'll be able to move on  
  
How can I fight, when we're on the same side  
How can I fight beside you  
  
So keep on calling me names, keep on, keep on  
And I'll keep kicking the crap 'til its gone  
If you keep on killing  
You could get me to settle  
And as soon as I settle  
I bet I'll able to move on

Here's another speech you wish I'd swallow  
Another cue for you to fold your ears  
Another train of thought too hard to follow  
Chugging along to the song that belongs to  
  
The shifting of gears  
Please forgive me for my distance  
The pain is evident in my existence  
Please forgive me for my distance  
  
The shame is manifest in my resistance  
To your love, to your love, to your love  
I would've warned you, but really, what's the point  
Caution could but rarely ever helps  
  
Don't be down when my demeanor tends to disappoint  
It's hard enough even trying to be civil to myself  
Please forgive me for my distance  
The pain is evident in my existence  
  
Please forgive me for my distance  
The shame is manifest in my resistance  
To your love, to your love, to your love  
My derring-do allows me to dance the rigadoon  
  
Around you  
But by the time I'm close to you , I lose  
My desideratum and now you, so  
Now you have it, so baby tell me what's the word  
  
Am I your gal or should I get out of town  
I just need to be reassured  
Do you just deal it out or can you deal with  
What I lay down

When I saw you at the grocery store  
You were sharin a shopping cart with her  
And I couldn't turn and run away  
I didn't know what to say  
You introduced us for the first time  
And I had to look her in the eye  
But you could not imagine my surprise  
Can't you see?  
You're leaving me  
For an ugly girl  
Does she talk about politics?  
And all that stuff that used to make me sick  
Does she smoke cigars and stay up late  
Oh she's so great  
Does she tell you what you want to hear?  
And I bet that she could grow a beard  
I feel better thinking you were queer  
It's not fair  
I can't compare  
To an ugly girl  
To an ugly girl  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Hahaha the jokes on me  
I feel jealous and I feel mean  
She's so nice that it makes up for her face  
There's no way, do you have to keep your eyes closed  
Do you have to keep the lights down low?  
Oh I bet you wish you had a blind fold  
Can't you see you're leaving me  
For an ugly girl  
For an ugly girl  
She's an ugly girl  
A real ugly girl  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
Lalalalalalalala Lalalalalalalala  
She's an ugly girl  
An ugly girl  
She's an ugly girl...

Those boon times went bust  
My feet of clay, they've dried to dust  
The red isn't the red we painted,  
It's... Just... Rust  
That signature thing that used to bring a following  
I have trouble now, even remembering  
  
So why did I kiss him so hard late last friday night  
And keep on letting him change all my plans  
I'm either so sick in the head  
I need to be bled dry to quit  
Or I just really used to love him  
I sure hope that's it  
  
I knew that to keep in touch would do me deep in dutch  
'Cause it isn't the rush of remembering, it's just mush  
And that signature thing is only growing harrowing  
I should have no trouble now to keep from following  
  
So why did I kiss him so hard late last friday night

I'm either so sick in the head  
I need to be bled dry to quit  
Or I just really used to love him

You didn't see my valentine  
I sent it via pantomime  
While you were watchin' someone else  
I stared at you and cut myself  
  
It's all I'll do 'cause I'm not free  
A fugitive too dull too flee  
I'm amorous but out of reach  
A still life drawing of a peach  
  
I'm a tulip in a cup  
I stand no chance of growing up  
I've made my peace I'm dead, I'm done  
I watched you live to have my fun  
  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you, you  
  
I made it to a dinner date  
My teardrops seasoned every plate  
I tried to dance but lost my nerve  
I cramped up in the learning curve  
  
I'm a tulip in a cup  
I stand no chance of growing up  
I'm resigned to sail on through  
In the wake of tales of you  
  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you  
You, you, you, you  
I root for you, I love you  
You, you, you

If you don't have a song  
To sing you're okay  
You know how to get along  
Humming  
Hmmm  
  
If you don't have a date  
Celebrate  
Go out and sit on the lawn  
And do nothing  
'Cause it's just what you must do  
Nobody does it anymore  
  
No I don't believe in the wasting of time,  
But I don't believe that I'm wasting mine  
  
If you don't have a point to make  
Don't sweat it  
You'll make a sharp one being so kind  
And I'd sure appreciate it  
Everyone else's goal's to get big headed  
Why should I follow that beat being that I'm  
Better than fine

I could liken you to a werewolf  
The way you left me for dead  
But I admit that I provided a full moon  
  
And I could liken you to a shark  
The way you bit off my head  
But then again I was waving around a bleeding open wound  
  
But you were such a super guy  
'Til the second you get away from me  
We're like a wishing well  
And a bolt of electricity  
But we could still support each other  
All we gotta do is avoid each other  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key  
  
The lava of a volcano  
Shot up hot from under the sea  
One thing leads to another  
And you made an island of me  
  
And I could liken you to a chemical  
The way you made me compound to compound  
But I'm a chemical too  
Inevitable you and me would mix  
  
And I could liken you to a lot of things  
But I always come around  
'Cause in the end I'm a sensible girl  
I know the fiction of the fix  
  
But you were such a super guy  
'Til the second you get away from me  
We're like a wishing well  
And a bolt of electricity  
But we could still support each other  
All we gotta do is avoid each other  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key  
Nothing wrong when a song ends in the minor key

I'm sentimental  
So I walk in the rain  
I've got some habits  
Even I can't explain  
Go to the corner  
I end up in Spain  
Why try to change me now  
  
I sit and daydream  
I've got daydreams galore  
Cigarette ashes  
There they go on the floor  
Go away weekends  
Leave my keys in the door  
Why try to change me now  
  
Why can't I be more conventional  
People talk  
People stare  
So I try  
But can't be  
'Cause I can't see  
My strange little world  
Just go passing me by  
  
So let people wonder  
Let 'em laugh  
Let 'em frown  
You know I'll love you  
Till the moon's upside down  
Don't you remember  
I was always your clown  
Why try to change me now  
  
Don't you remember  
I was always your clown  
Why try to change me  
Why try to change me now

I was staring out the window  
The whole time he was talking to me  
It was a filthy pane of glass  
I couldn't get a clear view  
  
As he went on and on  
It wasn't the outside world I could see  
Just the filthy pane that I was looking through  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
I was never focused on just one thing  
My eyes got fixed when my mind got soft  
It may looked like I'm concentrated on a very clear view  
  
But I'm as good as asleep  
I bet you didn't know  
It takes a lot of it away if you do  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
Because the fact in fact  
Whatever's in front of me is covering my view  
So I can't see what I'm seeing in fact  
I only see what I'm looking through  
  
I had to break the window  
It just had to be it was in my way  
Better that I break the window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
So again I've done the right thing  
I was never worried about that  
The answer's always been in clear view  
But even when the window's clean  
I still can't see for the fact  
That when it's clean it's so clear  
I can't tell what I'm looking through  
  
So I had to break the window  
It just had to be  
Better that I break the window  
Than him or her or me  
  
I had to break the window  
It just had to be it was in my way  
Better that I break the window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
I had to break the window  
It was in my way  
Better that I break a window  
Then forget what I had to say  
  
Or miss what I should see  
Or breaking him or her or me
