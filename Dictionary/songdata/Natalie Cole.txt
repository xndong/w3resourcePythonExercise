He stays out every night  
And leaves me all alone  
He never tells me where he goes  
I'm not the only lonely one  
Just ask a woman who knows  
We used to share our troubles  
And the good times too  
  
Now I'm left with all the woes  
I'm not the only sorry one  
Just ask a woman who knows  
The days are long  
  
Oh, but the nights are longer  
I got the lonesomest blues  
You know my only consolation  
Is I ain't got nothing more to lose  
So there you have the story  
Of a love gone wrong  
  
That used to blossom like a rose  
Oh, I'm not the only broken heart  
Just ask a woman who knows  
  
Well my only consolation  
Is that I got nothing more to lose  
So there you have the story  
Of a love gone wrong  
  
That used to blossom like a rose  
But I'm not the only broken heart  
Just ask a woman  
And I'm a woman  
Just ask a woman who knows  
Oh, yeah  
Ask a woman, ask a woman  
And I'm a woman  
Who knows

I really can't stay, baby, it's cold outside  
I've got to go away, oh darlin' it's cold outside  
This evening has been, just hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice, I'll hold your hands they're just like ice  
  
My mother will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor, listen to that fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry, oh beautiful, please don't hurry  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
Why don't you put some music on while I pour  
  
The neighbors will think, baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink, there's no cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
  
I ought to say no, sir, mind if I move in a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried  
Oh, what's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay, baby don't hold out, ah, but it's cold outside  
  
What are you doing with your coat  
You don't need your coat  
Why are you putting your coat on for  
It's warm out here, you don't understand  
  
I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside  
Oh, the answer is no, oh darlin', it's cold outside  
This welcome has been, lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm, look out that window at that storm  
  
My sister will be suspicious, please but your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, oh but your lips look delicious  
Well, maybe just a half a drink more  
They was never such a blizzard before  
  
Ooh, I got to go home, baby, you'll freeze out there  
Say, lend me your coat, it's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand, I trill when you touch my hand  
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me  
  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my lifelong sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay, get over that old out  
Ah, but it's cold outside, ah, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby, it's cold outside, baby, it's cold outside  
It's cold outside, it's cold, baby, it's cold outside  
You know that it's, you know that it's cold outside  
Ah, it's cold outside  
  
Darlin' as a friend, sure James  
As a friend you, you must stay and, and warm up by this fire little bit  
Let me get you, let me get you a hot toddy or something  
Well, I really can't my mother will worry about me  
  
People are so suspicious, it's just an innocent suggesting  
You stay warm and keep yourself healthy that's all  
It's nippy out there, it's cold  
Oh, you know that drink does look kinda nice  
It is a perfectly nice drink  
  
Baby, it's cold out, baby, it's cold, it's warm  
Baby, it's cold out, baby, it's cold outside

Beautiful dreamer, you are like magic to me  
'Cause you share all your love  
And your life and your love is so fine in my life  
It's just what I've been looking for  
Searching for and you care  
Beautiful dreamer, not an illusion to me  
You know I can tell by the way that you've taken my hand  
In a moment of sadness your gladness is there to surround me  
Astound me and you care  
  
I've seen all the people (waiting at the station)  
Waiting at the station  
(No imagination) no imagination  
They're too busy doing nothing  
Making all kinds of arrangements  
(Nothing's really) but nothing's really changing them  
(Changing them)  
  
They're (they're) still asking why (why) their well is dry  
I tried to tell them that love is the answer  
They need a beautiful dreamer  
If I could I'd share you with them  
Oh, but you know it took so very long to find what I've needed  
And my greatest obsession is doing my best  
Just to keep you and love you 'cause you care  
  
You're one in a million  
(Always giving into) always giving into  
(Me whenever I begin to) me whenever I begin to act  
A little like I'm crazy  
Still (still you never faulter) you never faulter

How I could I not be proud to have your wisdom  
You're such a beautiful dreamer (beautiful dreamer)

'Cause you share all your love  
And your life (and your life)  
And your love is so fine

And you know its just what I've been searching for  
Looking for and you care

Are you sure that love is even better than shopping?  
Well, there's a little sale on late floor at Barneys but it's still better  
Oh, come on, come on

I was dressed to kill, I was ready  
Oh, girl, I was stepping out, yeah  
I was on my way to meet my steady  
When this fire thing turned me right around  
At first I was frightened  
Because he took me, he took me by surprise, whoo  
But my heart knew that it was a hold-up  
I could see the love light shining in his eyes  
Right then I was held up  
Girl, I was held up  
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
Yes, I was held up  
My heart was held up  
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
The way he stole my affection  
Oh, girl, you know that it ought to be a crime  
Mm-hmm, and the way that he changed my direction  
I had no projection  
And I swear to you that I ain't lyin'  
Oh-hoo, love was right here among me  
I never knew that heaven could be so close  
I was on my way to meet my steady  
When right next door is what I needed most  
Oh, I was held up  
Right then I was held up  
Oh, I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I was held up  
Ooh, I was held up

Because he took me, he took me surprise  
But my heart knew that it was a hold-up, yeah  
I saw the love light shining in his eyes  
Right then, right then I was held up  
My heart was held up  
But you know I was held up  
By Billy the Kid next door  
Ooh-ooh-ooh, I was held up  
Yes, I was held up  
Ay-I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
You'd be so lonely  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
Ow, he had a love gun  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
I was held up by Billy the Kid next door  
And I know he's wanted  
(Bang, bang, shoot 'em up)  
Oh, the boy is wanted

Caroling, caroling now we go  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling through the snow  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Joyous voices sweet and clear  
Sing the sound of heart to cheer  
Ding dong, ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Caroling, caroling through the town  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Caroling, caroling up and down  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Harmony ? the song we sing  
Gladsome tidings now we bring  
Ding dong, ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Caroling, caroling near and far  
Christmas bells are ringing  
Following, following yonder star  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Sing we now this happy morn  
For the king of heaven is born  
Ding dong, ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing  
  
Ding dong, ding dong  
Christmas bells are ringing

[Chorus]  
Coffee time  
My dreamy friend  
It's coffee time  
Let's sing  
This silly  
Little rhyme  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
  
Java time  
My happy chum  
Let's have a time  
We'll celebrate  
For just a dime  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
  
Greetin' time  
The music box  
Is beatin' time  
It's good  
Old-fashioned  
Meetin' time  
We're in the pink  
So come and clink  
And let's drink  
A cup of coffee  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
And have  
A cup of coffee  
And have  
A cup of coffee

I'm gonna love you  
Like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain  
And deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one of those things  
But don't ever bet me  
Cause I'm gonna be true  
If you let me  
  
You're gonna love me  
Like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together  
Unhappy together  
And won't it be fine?  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine

Now you say you're lonely  
You cried the long night through  
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I've cried a river over you  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
Well, you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I've cried a river over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
  
Told me love was to plebeian  
Told me you were through with me  
And now you say you love me  
  
Well, just to prove you do  
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river  
I've cried a river over you  
  
Well, you told me love was to plebeian  
Told me you were through with me  
And now you say you love me  
  
Well, just to prove that you do  
Come on and cry me a river, I wanna see a river  
'Cause I've cried a river over you  
  
I've cried a river over you, I've cried a river over you  
I've cried a river over you, I've cried a river over you  
I've cried a river over you, I've cried a river over you

Darling, je vous aime beaucoup  
Je ne sais pas what to do  
You know you've completely  
Stolen my heart  
  
Morning, noon and night-time too  
Toujours, wondering what to do  
That's the way I've felt  
Right from the start  
  
Ah, Cherie!  
My love for you is tr?s, tr?s fort  
Wish my French were good enough  
I'd tell you so much more  
  
But I hope that you compree  
  
All the things you mean to me  
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup  
I love you, yes I do  
  
Wish my French were good enough  
I'd tell you so much more  
  
But I hope that you compree  
All the things you mean to me  
Darling, je vous aime beaucoup  
I love you, yes I do  
  
(Darling, je vous aime beaucoup)  
I love you, yes I do

Sky so vast is the sky  
With far away clouds just wandering by  
Where do they go? Oh, I don't know, don't know  
  
Wind that speaks to the leaves  
Telling Stories that no one believes  
Stories of love belong to you and me  
  
Oh Dindi, if I only had words  
I would say all the beautiful things that I see  
When you're with me, oh, my Dindi  
  
Oh Dindi, like the song of the wind in the trees  
That's how my heart is singing Dindi  
Happy Dindi when you're with me  
  
I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do  
I'd let you go away if you take me with you  
  
Don't you know, my Dindi?  
I'd be running and searching for you  
Like a river that can't find the sea  
That would be me without you, my Dindi  
  
I love you more each day, yes, I do, yes, I do  
I'd let you go away if you take me with you  
  
Don't you know, Dindi?  
I'd be running and searching for you  
Like a river that can't find the sea  
That would be me without you, without you, yeah  
My Dindi, my Dindi, my Dindi

Hush now, don't explain  
Just say you'll remain  
I'm glad your back, don't explain  
  
Quiet, don't explain  
What is there to gain  
Skip that lipstick  
Don't explain  
  
You know that I love you  
And what endures  
All my thoughts of you  
For I'm so completely yours  
  
Cry to hear folks chatter  
And I know you cheat  
Right or wrong, don't matter  
When you're with me, sweet  
  
Hush now, don't explain  
You're my joy and pain  
My life's yours love  
Don't explain

Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't get around much anymore  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't get around much anymore  
Darling, I guess my mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless, why stir up memories  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for  
Awfully different without you  
Don't get around much anymore

Everyday the population is growing  
And to find some peace of mind is something rare  
Don't you get discouraged, keep on going  
And don't you mind the way that the people turn and stare  
Now how long can you keep on feeling guilty  
And tell me why should you feel bad about feeling good  
Don't you know that the world is cold and filthy,  
Aw yes it is, but if you're a special child  
  
They know sometimes you'll be misunderstood, (you can never look back)  
Yesterday is dead and gone, (don't you look back)  
Your tomorrow is here today  
Keep on fighting, a quitter never wins,  
Hold your breath stick out your chin  
Count to ten, start again,  
  
Everybody wants to be somebody  
But they can't seem to see the forest for the trees,  
We just can't let our past hold back our future, oh, no, no,  
When its all over but the shouting  
Nothing is left but memories,  
Looks like you could use a little bit of happiness  
Now I know that its really hard to find,  
But you owe it to yourself to have the very best  
  
And only a fool will try to catch up to what he has left behind, (you can
never look back)  
No, no, 'cause yesterday is dead and gone, (don't you look back)  
Your tomorrow is here today  
  
And when you're crying, you need someone to hold on to  
It's not the end of the world my friend, tip your hat, start again  
And keep a positive direction, oh,  
Keep your vision straight ahead  
  
You can't lose with the stuff you use,  
We've come too far just to turn around, oh, oh,  
Don't you look back, yesterday is dead and gone (don't you look back)  
Your tomorrow is on the way and if you're fighting people, a quitter never
wins  
  
Hold your breath, stick out your chin,  
Count to ten, start again, don't you look back  
No, no, uh, oh, (don't look back)  
No 'cause we've come much too far  
Just to turn around, uh, oh, oh, (repeat don't you look back)  
Don't you look back now  
Yesterday is dead and gone, don't you look back,  
Your tomorrow is here today  
  
And when you're crying, 'cause all your friends have forsaken you  
Its not the end of the world my friend,  
Just tip your hat start again  
Keep on steppin' y'all, don't look back,  
Don't turn your head around  
Get up, get out on the good foot,  
Keep on fightin,' yeah, hold your breath  
Stick out your chin, count to ten and start again, don't try it  
You got to keep on movin' y'all,  
Get, get, get up on the good foot

Over and over again

Don't ever, ever say  
Ever, ever, ever say  
  
Don't say goodnight

Everytime we say goodbye, I die a little,  
Everytime we say goodbye, I wonder why a little,  
Why the Gods above me, who must be in the know.  
Think so little of me, they allow you to go.  
When you're near, there's such an air of spring about it,  
I can hear a lark somewhere, begin to sing about it,  
There's no love song finer, but how strange the change from major to  
minor,  
Everytime we say goodbye.

minor,  
Everytime we say goodbye.  

I know you're thinking that I'm playing  
But I'm saying that I wouldn't hurt you for the world, oh no  
I'm not so blind, Baby  
I need your lovin' and you know it (yes, I do, well) 'cause I'll show it, well  
I don't want to be hurt you  
  
If you want me to I'll keep it a secret  
But please let me get through your door  
'Cause I guarantee that once we get started  
You'll soon be begging for more  
We want the whole world to know that we are one  
So why don't you gimme some time, Baby  
Let's take advantage not for granted for the good things  
(We got for the good things)  
I don't want to be hurt you  
You just be kind, Baby  
  
We've got a good thing and I know it, let's not blow it, oh  
'Cause I wouldn't hurt you for the world, I'm serious  
I believe you think that I haven't noticed  
The look in your eyes when you smile  
And my senses tell me there's something missing  
So please let me stay for a little while  
I want the whole world to know that we are one  
We got it together, Baby, we're one  
So why don't you gimme some time, Baby  
I know you're thinking that I'm playing  
But all I'm saying  
  
'Cause I wouldn't hurt you for the world, I'm serious  
Gimme some time, Baby, gimme some time, Baby  
I, I know, you know, I know you love me  
And I thank that you thank that we should be together  
So why, why, why don't you gimme some of your time  
Hey, that's all I need, that's all I want  
Gimme just a little hour, just some more time  
Yeah, you better gimme some time  
Oh, you better gimme some time

Since the time we met never shall forget  
The magic feeling when I look in your eyes  
Every now and then I see you again  
But the words never come out right  
I've always been painfully shy  
I hide what I feel inside  
Tonight I  
(Never let you get away)  
Open my heart  
(Invite you in to stay)  
I need you  
(More than words can say)  
And I hope you feel the same  
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
You've captured my heart  
And I won't take no for an answer  
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
Hope that there's a chance, baby  
That we can get together  
'Cause I  
(Gonna make you mine)  
Gonna make you see  
(Gonna make you mine)  
You were meant for me  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I wanna love you endlessly  
Many times before I would just ignore  
Love when it came around and knocked on my door  
Keeping to myself, trusting no one else  
I've put my heart out of reach on a shelf  
With you I can't pass up this chance  
For a once in a lifetime romance  
'Cause after all  
(Someone said it very plain)  
When it comes to love  
(No pain, no gain)  
I think I'll  
(Take a chance on you)  
And you know I play to win  
I'm gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
You've captured my heart  
And I won't take no for an answer  
Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine  
Hope that there's a chance, honey  
That we can get together  
'Cause I  
(Gonna make you mine)  
Gonna make you see  
(Gonna make you mine)  
You were meant for me  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I wanna love you endlessly, yeah  
Oh, I'm looking for one lifetime romance  
(Someone said it very plain)  
I'll think I'll  
(No pain, no gain)  
Take a chance on you  
(Take a chance on you)  
Ooh, 'cause you know I play to win, baby  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I'll make you mine  
You've captured my heart  
And I won't take no for an answer  
(Gonnna make you mine)  
I'm gonna make you mine  
I believe there's a chance that  
We can get together  
'Cause I  
(Gonna make you mine)  
Gonna make you see  
(Gonna make you mine)  
You were meant for me  
(Gonna make you mine)  
I gonna love you endlessly

Oh, you've captured my heart  
I know that we can get together, together, together  
(Gonna make you mine, I'll make you mine)  
I'm gonna make you and I'm gonna love you  
And I won't take no for answer  

Heaven is with you and I'm glad I'm with you tonight  
Just a little bit of heaven  
Heaven is with you and I'm glad, I'm with you tonight  
There's no place I'd rather be  
Than here tonight resting close to you  
'Cause in your arms I feel so strong  
I do believe we will love on forever, forever  
Heaven is with you and I'm glad, I'm with you tonight  
Baby, let me say that heaven must be  
It must be with you tonight, yeah  
I wanna be just what you see  
Now I want to give all of me eternally  
Yeah, yeah, and you can bet and count on me  
'Cause I'm all yours faithfully, forever, forever  
Heaven is with you and I'm glad, I'm with you tonight yeah  
I'm sure that you must be an angel  
'Cause heaven, yeah, is with you, yeah  
And I'm glad I'm with you tonight, well  
Baby, baby, baby  
For it was your love that really inspired me  
I will go wherever your love guides me  
And I do believe that wherever we go  
Baby, our love can't help but grow  
Heaven is with you and I'm glad, I'm with you tonight  
Yeah, yeah, all I can say is  
"Heaven is with you and I'm glad I'm with you tonight"  
Your love, your love is like heaven, is like heaven  
Heaven is with you and I'm glad I'm with you tonight  
You're like heaven, just a little bit of heaven, heaven is with you  
Just a little bit of heaven and I'm glad I'm with you tonight  

Maybe  
I should have saved  
Those leftover dreams  
Funny  
But here's that rainy day  
  
Here's that rainy day  
They told me about  
And I laughed at the thought  
That it might turn out this way  
  
Where is that worn out wish  
That I threw aside  
After it brought my love so near  
  
Funny how love becomes  
A cold rainy day  
Funny  
That rainy day is here  
  
It's funny  
How love becomes  
A cold rainy day  
  
Funny  
That rainy day is here

You know, of all the things in the world I'd miss  
It would probably be music and love  
They say you don't know what you've got 'til it's gone  
That's so true  
Even though we still take it for granted  
And I used to be like that, but not anymore  
'Cause I found out what love really means  
Love means happiness and dedication  
Love will sometimes bring complications  
But you must have faith and a whole lot of trust  
Most of all you can never give up just  
  
(Hold on, hold on)  
Hold on to your good thing, yeah  
(Hold on, hold on) forget about the small things  
(Hold on, hold on) do it for love, do it for love  
  
And remember that love is a feeling  
But it's also an action, yes  
You've got to give sometime  
If you want to get back some, well  
And when all the king's horses  
And even all the king's men  
Can't put it together again  
That is exactly when you've got to  
  
(Hold on, hold on) hold on to what you've got  
(Hold on, hold on)  
It's the little things that mean a lot  
(Hold on, hold on) do it for love, do it for love  
In spite of everything, no matter what  
You've got to H-O-L-D on (you gotta hold on)  
Hold on, hmm, hmm, hmm, ooh, oh, oh  
  
You're so hard headed  
'Cause you feel that you're right  
Well, tell me how you gonna feel  
In the middle of the night  
All alone, all alone  
I know, I know  
It doesn't matter who's right or wrong  
If you feel so inclined  
To blame that shame on someone else  
Ooh, stop and think about it  
Point the finger at yourself  
Ooh, hoo, hoo, hoo, hoo  
  
Hold on to your good thing (hold on)  
Forget about the small (hold on) things  
(Hold on) And hold on  
Hold on, oh hold on (hold on)  
Real tight in spite of everything  
Hold on (hold on)  
When you feel like walking out that door.

How do you keep  
The music playing?  
How do you make it last  
How do keep  
The song from fading  
Too fast  
  
How do you lose yourself  
To someone  
And never lose your way  
How do you not run  
Out of new things  
To say  
  
And since you know  
We're always changing  
How can it be the same  
And tell me how  
Year after year  
You're sure your heart  
Will fall apart  
Each time  
You hear her name  
  
I know the way  
I feel for you  
Is now or never  
The more  
I love the more  
There I'm afraid  
That in yours eyes  
I may not see forever  
Forever  
  
If we can be  
The best of lovers  
Yet be the best of friends  
If we can try with every day  
To make it better as it goes  
With any luck than I suppose  
The music never ends

I fall to pieces  
Each time I see you again  
I fall to pieces  
How can I be just your friend  
  
You want me to act like we've never kissed  
You want me to forget pretend we've never met  
And I tried and I tried but I haven't yet  
You walk by and I fall to pieces  
  
I fall to pieces  
Each time someone speaks your name  
I fall to pieces  
Time only adds to the flame  
  
You tell me to find someone else to love  
Someone who'll me too  
The way you used to do  
But each time I go out with someone new  
  
You walk by and I fall to pieces  
You walk by and I fall to pieces

I never loved him, he never reached me  
He was just someone, someone I knew  
I think about him on alternate Thursdays  
When I haven't got anything better to do  
  
He's got a problem if he thinks I need him  
I couldn't care less now that we're through  
I only sit home and I wait for his phone call  
When I haven't got anything better to do  
  
Wasn't I awfully smart not to fall and break my heart  
He never meant a thing to me, he's gone  
I'm glad, I'm free  
And when he kissed me, no no he never moved me  
Nothing fantastic, thrilling or new  
So if I'm crying, I'm only crying  
Cause I haven't got anything better  
No I haven't got anything better  
I haven't got anything better to do without you  
I never loved him, no he never moved me  
Nothing fantastic

Stand up, stand on your own, that's what they tell me  
You can make it alone, but where does it say I have to move  
Far away from you to prove I'm strong,  
Oh when all it really proves is I'm lonely without you  
  
And loneliness has to be wrong, I live for your love, (everyday), every minute  
I live for your love, (in my life), want you in it  
I live for your love, I admit it, I live for your love  
I wake up with no one to kiss, sometimes I wonder, (wonder, wonder) if I just
exist  
  
I know there are people I can see, places I could be, and friends who call  
Oh but what good does it do, there's no substitute for you  
I want you or nothing at all, I live for your love, (every day), every minute  
I live for your love, (in my life), want you in it, I live for your love, I
admit it  
I live for your love and your kisses, and know how I'm missing  
  
Your sweet tender touch, (tender touch), I need you so much  
That I just can't go on anymore, what I wouldn't give for  
'Cause darling I live for your love, (Everyday), every minute  
I live for your love, (Got one life) want you in it  
I live for your love, I hate to admit it, but oh, I live for, I'd die for  
  
What I wouldn't give for your love, (I live for your love every day)  
I live for your love, (got one life) every day, every minute  
(I live for your love), I have only got one life, I want you in it  
Oh, my baby, yes, yes, I live for your love, ooh, ooh

Written by chuck jackson and marvin yancy  
Today we broke up, tomorrow we'll make up  
And again he'll hang up on me  
But you see I know he'll never hurt me  
I know he'll never desert me  
And so I just say that's my man anyway  
Tonight we'll love plenty, tomorrow maybe not any  
But I'm sure he'll come through just in time  
And to me he's more than just a man  
He's my life so I understand why things has got to be his way  
And I love him so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
Yes, I do, so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
He makes me cry when I wanna laugh sometimes  
His moods, they keep changing all the time  
But I know just where his head is when it's not laying on top of mine  
His world is not so different and you may not believe  
But I'm sure you'd understand him if you were me  
And that's why this world can't look and frown  
But I'll never let him down  
That is my man and he means the world to me  
And I love him so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
Yes, I love him so much, so much 'til it hurts me  
Oh (so much, so much 'til it hurts me)  
I love him so (so much, so much 'til it hurts me) much  
So much, so much--  

Ah, baby  
How do I start? Where do I begin?  
I've been hurt so much, I just need a friend  
Could it be you? Will you break through these walls?  
Are you willing to help them fall?  
  
I want to love again, but I'm afraid to  
I want to trust again, but my heart says not to  
Your every smile, your gentle touch makes me weak  
I want you so much  
I want love again and this time with you  
  
I didn't know that this would be so hard for me  
Being this close to you is driving me crazy  
My mind says no, oh, but my body says yes  
You make one move and I'll do the rest  
  
I want to love again, but I'm afraid to  
I want to trust again, but my heart says not to  
Your every smile, your gentle touch makes me weak  
I want you so much  
I want to love again and this time with you  
  
Oh, it's been so long, since I've seen your face  
And I'm just trying to be strong  
Oh, but I think about you everyday  
And it makes me weak when I see your face  
I guess it means, I'm in a different space  
Cause I wanna love again and this time with you  
  
I want to love again but I'm afraid to  
I want to trust again, but my heart says not to  
Your every smile, your gentle, gentle touch makes me weak  
I want you so much  
I want to love again  
  
Please let me love again  
I want to love again  
And this time with you  
I just wanna love again with you

Goodbye, no use leading with our chins  
This is where our story ends  
Never lovers, ever friends  
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day  
  
But before you walk away  
I sincerely want to say  
I wish you bluebirds in the spring  
To give your heart a song to sing  
  
And then a kiss, but more than this  
I wish you love  
And in July a lemonade  
To cool you in some leafy glade  
  
I wish you health  
But more than wealth  
I wish you love  
My breaking heart and i agree  
  
That you and i could never be  
So with my best  
My very best  
I set you free  
  
I wish you shelter from the storm  
A cozy fire to keep you warm  
But most of all when snowflakes fall  
I wish you love  
But most of all when snowflakes fall  
  
I wish you love  
I wish you love  
I wish you love, love, love, love, love  
I wish you love

Hmm...., well, well, well, well, well  
The mailman smiled as he handed me the news, tell you chil'  
I nearly jumped out of my shoes, the postcard read returning home tonight  
My body jumped with pure delight, I know you're gonna need  
Some tender lovin' care, whatever you need you know I'll be right there  
(Honey I won't deny you) that's one thing honey, that I'll never, never do  
(Honey, I won't deny you) you took care of me, I'll take of you  
(Doot, doot, doo, doo, doo) Now when I'm down (repeat Doo, doo)  
You make me feel better, and your love for me really keeps me together  
Come rain or shine, night or day, whenever you call me it'll be okay  
If you want to stop by 'cause you're in the neighborhood  
Or if you want me to make you feel real good (repeat Honey I won't deny you)  
Oh, no (I won't deny you) that's one thing I'll never do to you  
You took care of me, I'll take care of you (doot, doot, doo, doo, doo)  
You know my body hungers for you and I know that's right  
And when I can't get it, I get so uptight, here by my side  
Is where you aught to be if you bring your lovin' home to me  
(Repeat honey I won't deny you) I, that's one thing I'll never do to you  
I won't, cause you took care of me and I'll take care of you, oh, yeah, yeah  
Musical Interlude  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, (I won't deny you, I won't deny you)  
Here by my side is where you aught to be, if you bring your lovin' home to me  
I (I won't deny you, honey I won't deny you) That's one thing I'll never do,
no  
(I won't deny you) I, I won't deny you, I won't deny you, I won't deny you,  
(Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo) I won't deny you

If you could see me now you'd know how blue I've been  
One look is all you need to see the mood I'm in  
Perhaps when you'd realize I'm still in love with you  
  
If you could see me now you'd find me being raised  
And trying offly hard to make my tears behave  
But that's quite impossible, I'm still in love with you  
  
You happened my way on some memorable day  
A month will be made for a while  
I'll try to smile but can I play the part without my heart  
  
Behind the smile  
The way I feel for you I never could disguise  
The look of love is written plainly in my eyes  
  
I think you'd be mine again  
If you could see the way you captured me  
I'm yours eternally, if you could see now

Tonight, I, I just want to talk to the ladies, oh fellows your cool but girls  
  
If you've got a good man, you'd better keep him,  
  
Oh I know you're saying right now, what does she know  
  
Who is she to tell me about my situation, well, I don't know your situation  
  
But whatever it is, you should try to stay together  
  
You know that big argument that you had the other night, remember  
  
Well, today it's not nothing, just don't let him leave you honey  
  
Cause then you'll find out that it wasn't those real big things you loved
about  
Him  
  
It was the real small things, go on and laugh but it's true  
  
You know, things that you've seen a thousand times around the house  
  
But never paid any attention to, like helping with the groceries  
  
And helping in the yard and painting and repairing and huh, paying the bills  
  
But you know now, all I have is memories and regrets  
  
I could have given our love a chance to grow but no  
  
I had to challenge it and be heard (oh), let me tell you something  
  
That female liberation stuff, I don't know, sometimes I don't think it's worth
it  
  
And I'm really feeling, feeling kind of bad yaul, I'm catching hell living
here  
Alone  
  
Hmm, I never realized, oh Lord, that you mean so much to me  
  
I'm catching hell living here alone, I want you to come back baby  
  
Come back cause here's where you belong, oh yeah  
  
If I could replay, if I could replay that whole scene again, oh well  
  
You know that I would never, never say it again, that our love, our love is at  
Its end  
  
And oh, you know that I would kind of ease on back, yes I would  
  
And let confusion pass on by, I took a fools'way out, oh yeah  
  
Without one good reason why, I'm catching hell, catching hell  
  
Lord I'm living, living, living here alone, Alone, lone, I didn't believe it  
Could be  
  
You know all the pressure on me, all the time, oh, I'm catching hell, well,
well  
  
Living here alone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, lone, to tell you the truth  
  
To tell you the truth I'm going out of my mind---, yeah, oh do you hear me  
Tonight  
  
I don't have too (this is my story) much more to say except  
  
Somebody (hey, this is my song) told me that if you've got something  
  
That's good to you And you don't use it (sad, sad) you might lose it (sad,
song)  
  
(Song, so sad) So girls hold on to your good thing (Oh), (you gotta hold on a  
Little bit now)  
  
And don't let go, oh---do you hear me tonight, It's so sad living alone  
  
Living alone (Hmm), hold on to your good thing, hold on, (well, well) oh yeah  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah---oh, oh, oh, Lordy, Lordy do you know what it's like  
  
Catching hell, (somebody turn up the microphone, oh---), Oh, no, no, no, no,  
No, no

  
Said I, many times, love is illusion,  
A feeling result of confusion.  
With knowing smile, and blazing sigh,  
A cynical so-and-so was i.  
I felt so sure, so positive,  
So utterly, unchangingly certain.  
But I never was aware of love and you,  
And suddenly I realized  
There was love and you,  
And I, and i.  
In this world of ordinary people  
Extraordinary people  
I'm glad there is you  
In this world of over-rated pleasures  
Of under-rated treasures  
I'm so glad there is you  
I live to love, I love to live with you beside me  
This role so new, I'll muddle through with you to guide me  
In this world where many, many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love  
I'm glad there is you  
  
In this world where many, many play at love  
And hardly any stay in love  
I'm glad there is you  
More than ever, I'm glad there is you  
  
  

Ya yeh ya, heyey ya, oh woh woh woh woh, ah ah ah ahh

Inseperable, That's how we'll always be  
Inseperable, Just you and me  
It's so wonderful to know you'll always be around  
Incredible, What you are to me  
Incredible, You bring out the woman in me  
With your style of love  
Inseperable, Yes we are  
Well like a flower to a tree  
Like words to a melody of love  
There's no way we could break up  
No words that can make us  
Blow our thing. We're just  
Inseperable, That's how it is  
Inseperable, For the rest of our years  
It's so wonderful to know you'll always be around.

It's the wrong time  
And the wrong place  
Though your face  
Is charming  
It's the wrong face  
It's not her face  
But such  
A charming face  
That it's  
All right with me  
  
It's the wrong song  
In the wrong style  
Though your smile  
Is lovely  
It's the wrong smile  
It's not her smile  
But such  
A lovely smile  
That it's  
All right with me  
  
You can't know  
How happy  
I am that we met  
I'm strangely  
Attracted to you  
There's someone  
I'm trying  
So hard to forget  
Don't you want  
To forget someone  
Too?  
  
It's the wrong game  
With the wrong chips  
Though your lips  
Are tempting  
They're the wrong lips  
They're not her lips  
But they're  
Such tempting lips  
That if some night  
You are free  
Then it's all right  
Yes  
It's  
All right with me

Dashing through the snow  
In a one horse open sleigh  
O'er the fields we go  
Laughing all the way  
Bells on bob tails ring  
Making spirits bright  
What fun it is to laugh and sing  
A sleighing song tonight  
  
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
  
A day or two ago  
I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon my Mr. Right  
Was seated by my side  
The horse was lean and lank  
Misfortune seemed his lot  
We got into a drifted bank  
And then we kissed for luck  
  
Oh, jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh yeah  
  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh, what fun it is to ride  
In a one horse open sleigh

Here I am baby, right back in your arms, yeah  
What is it 'bout your love that draws me to you  
And though this is not the first time I've ever wanted to get away, no  
Oh, but the magic of your love just would not let me stray  
So I find that I just can't stay away from you, baby, (from you) ooh, yeah  
You see, I just can't stay away from you  
Let me tell you I've been through a lot of changes  
You see, my Momma scorned me and my closest friends  
Oh Lord, you know they warned me  
They said you're no good for me, but I just ignored it  
  
Yes I did, 'cause I didn't have time, no time to sit around and decide what to
do  
You know, when someone controls your mind  
There's not much you can do  
So you see that's why I (just can't) just can't stay away (stay away)  
Oh, oh (from you) from you, oh Baby  
Hold me Darling, hold (just can't) me Darling, I can't stay away from (stay
away) you  
I don't want to (from you) from you  
I've tried and I've tried, and I've tried, I've tried and I've tried, and I've
tried, Baby  
(When you come close to me, yeah)  
  
I remember, I can remember somebody said it  
They said it many, many, many (when you come close to me, yeah) years ago  
That when love gets in your blood, you'll find it's hard to let go  
And oh, I (just can't) Baby, I (stay away)  
Can't (from you) you see it in my eyes  
Cause I'm wanting you, needing you, ho  
Baby, I (just can't) I don't want to (stay away)  
  
Stay away (from you) from you  
From you, you, you, you, you  
It's not in my power to leave you  
You control the soul in me and I  
(Just can't) That's exactly why I (stay away)  
  
Can't stay away (from you) from you  
Oh 'cause I'm wanting you, needing you, loving you  
Baby, I'm down on my knees, (I just can't) hold me Darling  
I'm (Stay away) begging you please, hold me, Darling  
(From you) 'Cause I just can't stay from you, baby, no, no

Seems like the whole weight of the world is resting on you

You know that you've got to be strong and understand the facts of life  
You won't get no place until you make some sacrifice  
Try to make it a little easy when you're doing it on your own  
Once you think you've got everything, the next day it's all gone  
But you got to keep (keep smiling), well, well, well, well (keep smiling)

L, is for the way you look at me  
O, is for the only one I see  
V, is very, very extraordinary  
E, is even more than anyone that you adore can  
  
Love is all that I can give to you  
Love is more than just a game for two  
Two in love can make it  
Take my heart and please don't break it  
Love was made for me and you

Picture yourself on the sea of a setting sun  
The salty air and the taste of your lover's hair  
Inside you want to fly  
Ah, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi  
Come to the magical mist where the oceans kissed  
A thousand kisses or more on the sandy shore  
And never says goodbye  
Ah, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi  
Ooh, la costa, ooh  
Ooh, la costa, ooh  
Come feel the warm of the breeze as the swaying trees  
Caress the velvety skies like a whisper telling you to come and fly  
Ah, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi  
Musical interlude  
Run with the wind at your side let it set you free  
I'll watch the sun in your eyes as the seagulls fly  
Along this lover's isle  
Ah, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi  
You are my love and my life, you're my everything  
You calm the sea of my soul oh so tenderly  
It makes me very high  
Ah, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi, yi  
Ooh la costa, wee, ooh, wee  
Ooh la costa, ooh  
Picture yourself on the sea...  
Come feel the warm of the breeze..  
La costa......  

Like a lover, the morning sun slowly rises and kisses you awake  
Your smile is soft and drowsy as you let it play upon your face  
Oh how I dream I might be like the morning sun to you  
  
Like a lover the river wind,  
Sighs and ripples it's fingers through your hair  
Upon your cheek it lingers, never have I known a sweeter place  
Oh how I dream I might be like the river wind to you  
  
Oh how I envy a cup that knows your lips  
Let it be me, my love  
And a table that feels your fingertips  
Let it be me, let me be your love  
Bring an end to the endless days and nights without you  
  
Like a lover the velvet moon shares your pillow and watches while you sleep  
It's light arrives on tiptoe gently taking you in it's embrace  
Oh how I dream I might be like the velvet moon to you  
  
Como um radio de sol (Like the sunshine)  
A brincar com seui rosto (Playing upon your face)

Who do you love when your heart has had enough  
And its just another lie, and all you can do is cry  
Where can you go when you're left with just too much  
And its' more than you can take, gotta find another way  
  
'Cause we've all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more  
But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down  
Fed up, messed up, I still get up I'm gonna keep on  
(livin' for love) no one can stop me from (livin' for love) hey, hey, hey  
(livin' for love) who do you trust when you've given all you've got  
  
And there's nothing left inside but another damn goodbye  
Hey, how do you know if it's just another night  
And you're heart won't be betrayed then you face another day  
'cause we've all been there before and our hearts keep wanting more  
  
But no matter how I'm beat down, broke down, tore down, wore down  
Fed up, messed up, I still get up (livin' for love) cause I'm livin' for love

Hmm, talking on the telephone early in the morning dawn, softly singing in
your ear  
A song that I wrote last night, it's so very hard my dear, you are there  
And I am here, somehow words I try to say, they just don't seem to sound right  
  
Conversation's getting thin and my patience is too, I gotta go, I'll call you

My show is through, oh, hello operator, give me a little more time  
In the meantime get my baby on the line, please, in the meantime

I hope he gets them in time, hmm, hmm, love and kisses across the Pacific  
Gonna send them to that baby of mine, yeah, gonna send them to that baby of
mine  
  
(How you doing...) Sure do miss ya, I'd like to kiss ya  
(What...) What's that you said my dear, this connection's not so clear  
But if you said I love you, then you know that I feel the same way  
  
Hope the kids are doing fine, do they still get to school on time  
Oh by the way, I really miss your face around about supper time  
Conversation's gettin thin and my patience is too, gotta go  
  
I'll call you when my show is through, I'm sending love and kisses  
On the telephone wire, I hope he gets them in time  
Oh, love and kisses across the Pacific, gonna send them to that baby of mine  
Hmm, gonna send them to that baby of mine  
Oh, love and kisses, ooh, ooh, love and kisses

It's very clear  
Our love is here to stay  
Not for a year  
But ever and a day  
  
The radio and the telephone  
And the movies that we know  
May be passing fancies  
And in time may go  
But oh my dear  
Our love is here to stay  
  
Together we're  
Goin' a long, long way  
In time  
the rockies may crumble  
Gibraltar may tumble  
they're only made of clay  
  
But our love is here  
Oh Our love is here  
but our love is here to stay.

Lovers  
Lovers  
Lovers  
Lovers ev'rywhere!  
Ev'rywhere I go,  
In ev'ry face I see, the sign of love  
Shining so brightly.  
  
It's in the air,  
It's ev'rywhere, I can feel it in my bones,  
People holdin' hands,  
Makin' love really, really gettin' it on.

Then check this groove out baby,  
You'll see  
It is the sweetest sugar that you'd ever taste,  
You gotta chase those blues, get over 'em  
Don't stop now  
Control 'em  
And then you'll find you're shakin' 'em  
Get it all while you can  
Have a ball.  
  
There's a feelin and it's catchin  
Look what's happ'nin,  
Take a trip  
Make it hip,  
'Cause you'll dig it!  
  
Lovers,  
Beautiful lovers  
Lovers ev'rywhere

If you could see me now  
The one who said that he would rather roam  
The one who said he'd rather be alone  
If you could only see me now  
  
If I could hold you now  
Just for a moment, if I could really make you mine  
Just for a while turn back the hands of time  
If I could only hold you now  
  
'Cause I've been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin' any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains  
And lying in your lovin' arms again  
  
If you could hear me now  
Singin' somewhere in the lonely night  
Dreaming of the arms that hold me tight  
If you could only hear me now  
  
'Cause I've been too long in the wind  
Too long in the rain  
Takin' any comfort that I can  
Looking back and longing for the freedom of my chains  
And lying in your lovin' arms again  
  
I can almost feel your lovin' arms again.

Let the dishes wait, no need in dusting  
No reason to clean the dirty floor  
'Cause I'm sure it doesn't matter  
Now that he has gone away  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here today  
Let them go to the park and I'll sit alone here in the dark  
No joy left in my heart anymore  
Let me hold on to my memories  
And if I die this way just let it be  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here with me  
Why should I comb my head  
When I know, I'm not going anywhere?  
Why should I keep right on giving  
When I've lost my only reason for living?  
So go on, just go on and have yourself a ball  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here  
I have no plans for the future 'cause he's not here at all  

Oh daddy  
  
Oh daddy  
You know you make me cry  
How can you love me

Everything you do is just alright  
And I can't walk away from you  
Baby if I tried  
  
Oh daddy  
You soothe me with your smile  
You're letting me know  
You're the best thing in my life

Yes it's got to be me

You're my morning star shining brightly beside me  
And if we keep this love  
We will last through all eternity  
Just the way we are I love it, love it  
It's just the way it should be  
'cause our love will stand tall as the trees  
Our love will spread wide as the seas  
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above  
And we'll always be together, our love  
My love is surely one thing  
You can surely depend on  
In times of darkness and fear I go to you  
I know you'll make me strong  
You're gonna make me happy  
You're gonna make me smile  
  
'cause our love will stand tall as the trees  
Our love will be for the whole world to see  
Our love will change people's wrongs to right  
And we will never die  
'cause we'll always have each other, our love  
Ya oo oo oo oo  
Our love will stand tall as the trees  
Our love will spread as wide as the seas  
Our love will shine bright in the night like the stars above

Our love, yeah our love  
We got a good old fashioned love  
Hey hey baby our love  
We got a mighty, mighty fine love  
Our love we got a mighty, mighty good love  
  
Bring it down, just a little  
Cause love is soft, love is sweet  
Love is nice and love is gentle  
Love is joy, love is pain  
Love is laughing in the rain  
  
I've got love on my mind  
Love is always right on time  
Love is you and love is me  
Love is just a little baby  
I've got love on my mind  
Love is always right on time  
Love is you and love is me  
Love is gonna set you fire ya  
Our love, baby, our love

I never feel a thing is real  
When I'm away from you  
Out of your embrace  
The world's a temporary parking place  
  
A bubble for a minute  
You smile, the bubble has a rainbow in it  
  
Say, it's only a paper moon  
Sailing over a cardboard sea  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Yes, it's only a canvas sky  
Hanging over a muslin tree  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Without your love  
It's a honky-tonk parade  
Without your love  
It's a melody played in a penny arcade  
  
It's a Barnum and Bailey world  
Just as phony as it can be  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Yes, it's only a canvas sky  
Hanging over a muslin tree  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me  
  
Without your love  
It's a honky-tonk parade  
Without your love  
It's a melody played in a penny arcade  
  
It's a Barnum and Bailey world  
Just as phony as it can be  
But it wouldn't be make-believe  
If you believed in me

Hm, hm  
  
Hm, hm, hm, hm  
  
Just like a welcome fire  
  
That comes in the cold  
  
You make my heart warm  
  
And a little more love is born  
  
And I'm caught up once again on you  
  
Soft as a rose, your tenderness glows  
  
But you're so strong  
  
And I know I'm gonna love you long  
  
Well, crazy maybe  
  
But I've seen paradise  
  
Here in your eyes  
  
I'm in seventh heaven  
  
Ooh, there's nothing quite  
  
Like spending your life  
  
With a special someone  
  
It feels so right  
  
When the lights are out  
  
And I'm in the dark  
  
I'm not afraid, no  
  
Long as I can get a piece of your heart  
  
And the wind sighs  
  
I love you  
  
Specially when we touch  
  
I need it so much  
  
And I'm glad that we found love  
  
Let the record show that I know that I've  
  
Seen paradise here in your eyes

We have got the perfect harmony  
  
Specially when we touch  
  
You know I need it, oh, so much

Written by natalie cole  
Have you been to the very top of the highest hill  
Where the air is fresh and sweet and the sky is so clear  
Looking out on the country side and the view of the villages so far away  
There is nothing to feel, nothing to feel  
Come with me, won't you take my hand  
Let's explore this heaven right here on earth, peaceful living is here  
Me and you on this mountaintop with our love we will never stop  
'cause we both know peaceful living is right here  
And here we are in utopia where the sun never seems to go away  
And the moon is our friend, hmm  
Looking out on a starry night and the sky is like a sleigh for riding on  
But you don't need a pin, you don't need a pin  
Precious one, you're a joy to me  
And I know that there's no place else I'd rather be  
Peaceful living is here, yeah, yeah  
Me and you on this mountain top with our love we'll never stop

Pick yourself up, take a deep breath  
Dust yourself off and start all over again.  
Nothings impossible I have found  
For when my chin is on the ground  
I pick myself up, dust myself off and start all over again  
Don't lose your confidence if you slip  
Be grateful for a pleasant trip  
Just pick yourself up and dust yourself off  
Start all over again.  
  
Work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won  
You may be sick and tired, but you'll be a man my son.  
Will you remember the famous men  
Who had to fall to rise again  
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up  
Dust yourself off and start all over again  
Don't lose your confidence if you slip  
Be grateful for a pleasant trip  
Just pick yourself up dust yourself off  
And try to start all over again.  
  
You gotta work like a soul inspired till the battle of the day is won  
You may be sick and tired, but you're gonna be a man my son.  
Will you remember the famous men  
Who had to fall to rise again  
So take a deep breath, pick yourself up  
Dust yourself off and have a nice trip  
And start all over again!

You may think I'm fooling  
For the foolish things I do  
You may wonder how come I love you  
When you get on my nerves like you do  
Well baby, you know you bug me  
There ain't no secret about that  
Well come on over here and hug me  
And, baby, I'll spill the facts  
Well, honey it ain't your money  
Cause baby I got plenty of that  
  
I love you for your pink Cadillac  
Crushed velvet seats  
Riding in the back, oozing down the street  
Waving to the girls  
Peeling out of sight  
Spending all my money on a Saturday night  
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac  
Pink Cadillac  
  
Well now way back in the Bible, temptations always come along  
There's always somebody tempting you  
Somebody into doing something they know is wrong  
Well they tempt you man with silver and they tempt you sir with gold  
And they tempt you with the pleasures that the flesh does surely hold  
They say Eve tempted Adam with an apple  
Man I ain't going for that  
  
I know it was her pink Cadillac  
Crushed velvet seats  
Riding in the back, oozing down the street  
Waving to the girls  
Peeling out of sight  
Spending all my money on a Saturday night  
Honey, I just wonder what you do there in back of your pink Cadillac  
  
Now some folks say it's too big and uses too much gas  
Some folks say it's too old and that it goes too fast  
But my love is bigger than a Honda, it's bigger than a Subaru  
Hey man there's only one thing and one car that will do  
Anyway we don't have to drive it honey, we can park it out in back  
And have a party in your pink Cadillac

Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon Virgin Mother and Child  
Holy Infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
  
Silent night, holy night!  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!  
Christ, the Savior is born  
Christ, the Savior is born  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Son of God, love's pure light  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth

What I'll give you since you asked  
Is all my time together  
Take the rugged sunny days  
The warm and rocky weather  
Take the roads that I have walked along  
Looking for tomorrows time  
Piece of mind  
  
As my life spills into yours  
Changing with the hours  
Filling up the world with time  
Turning time to flowers  
I can show you all the songs  
That I never sang to one man before  
  
We have seen a million stones  
Lying by the water  
You have climbed the hills with me  
To the mountain shelter  
Taking off the days  
One by one  
Setting them to breathe  
In the sun  
  
Take the lilies and the lace  
From the days of childhood  
All the willow winding paths  
Leading up and outward  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
  
This is what I give  
This is what I ask you for  
Nothing more

Smile though your heart is aching  
Smile even though it's breaking  
When there are clouds in the sky you'll get by  
If you smile through your fear and sorrow  
Smile and maybe tomorrow  
You'll see the sun come shining through  
For you  
  
Light up your face with gladness  
Hide every trace of sadness  
Although a tear maybe ever so near  
That's the time you must keep on trying  
Smile- what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worth while  
If you just smile  
Oh that's the time you must keep on trying  
  
Smile what's the use of crying  
You'll find that life is still worth while  
If you just smile

Your love like wine  
Tasting sweeter to me everyday  
Your kiss, divine and it melts the cold inside away  
All of my life I've been waiting for a love like this  
And now that you're here, romance is just a second away  
It's gonna stay  
  
Till the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
Till the Mojave Red turns into blue  
When my lungs get tired of breathing  
And my heart stops its beating  
Then I'll stop loving you  
  
And if the dark, when there's no one calling out your name  
Well I'll hold you so tight  
And I'll whisper to you once again and again  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue  
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless start praying  
I'll stop loving you  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara (oh, oh)  
And the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue (that's a long time)  
When my lungs get tired of breathing  
And my heart stops its beating  
I'll stop loving you  
I don't want to miss a single heartbeat  
  
Sometimes my words get in the way  
But I hear your love just fine  
Just fine  
And its gonna take a long time  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue (that's a long time)  
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless stop praying  
I'll stop loving you  
  
When the snowfalls on the Sahara and the sun freezes over  
When the Mojave Red turns into blue (that's a long time)  
When the music's no longer playing and the faithless stop praying  
I'll stop loving you

The dark is filled with dreams  
So many dreams which one is mine  
One must be right for me  
Which dream of all the dreams  
  
When there's a dream for every star  
And there are oh so many stars  
So many stars  
The wind is filled with songs  
  
So many songs which one is mine  
One must be right for me  
Which song of all the songs  
When there's a song for every star  
  
And there are oh so many stars, so many stars  
Along the countless days, the endless nights  
That I have searched so many eyes  
So many hearts, so many smiles  
  
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell  
How will I know, out of, oh  
So many stars, so many stars  
  
Yes, the wind is filled with songs, so many songs  
Which one is mine, one must be right for me  
Which song of all the songs

Along the countless days, the endless nights

So many hearts, so many smiles  
  
Which one to choose, which way to go, how can I tell  
How will I know, out of, oh, so many stars  
So many stars, (so many stars) oh, so many stars  
  
(So many stars) oh, there are so many stars  
(So many stars) lots and lots of stars, oh so many (so many)  
Oh, so many (stars), many  
So many, many (so many) stars (stars)...

When I wake up each morning  
Trying to find myself  
And if I'm ever the least unsure  
I always remind myself  
Though you're someone in this world  
That I'll always choose to love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
As for me it's getting down to the last unspoken part  
When you must begin to ease the pain of a broken heart  
Tell me why should I even care  
If I have to lose your love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
Yet it wasn't enough for you  
All the love I had to give  
I did my best to keep you satisfied  
I guess you'll never know how much I tried  
I really tried  
  
And if ever our paths should cross again  
Well, You won't find me being the one  
Who gets lost  
Once I had so much to give  
But You just refused my love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
I did my best to keep you satisfied  
I guess you'll never know how much I tried  
I really tried  
  
When I wake up each morning  
Trying to find myself  
And if I'm ever the least unsure  
I always remind myself  
Though you're someone in this world  
I'll always choose to love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
Though you're someone in this world  
I'll always choose to love  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  
  
From now on  
You're only someone that I used to love  

Someone's rocking my dreamboat,  
Someone's invading my dream.  
We were sailing along,  
So peaceful and calm,  
Suddenly something went wrong.  
  
Someone's rocking my dreamboat,  
Disturbing the beautiful dream.  
It's a mystery to me,  
This mutiny at sea,  
Who can it be?  
  
A friendly breeze gave us a start  
To a paradise of our own.  
All at once a storm blew us apart  
And left me drifting alone.  
  
Someone's rocking my dreamboat,  
I'm captain without any crew.  
But with love as my guide,  
I'll follow the tide,  
I'll keep sailing 'til I find you.

Somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta give  
Somethings gotta give  
When an irresistible force such as you  
Meets and old immovable object like me  
You can bet as sure as you live  
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give  
Something's gotta give  
When an irrepressible smile such as yours  
Warms an old implacable heart such as mine  
Don't say no because I insist  
Somewhere, somehow  
Someone's gonna be kissed  
So on guard who knows what the fates have in store  
From their vast mysterious sky?  
I'll try hard ignoring those lips I adore  
But how long can anyone try?  
Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight it with all of our might  
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night  
We'll find out as sure as we live  
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give  
Something's gotta give  
Fight, fight, fight it with all of our might  
Chances are some heavenly star spangled night  
We'll find out as sure as we live  
Something's gotta give, something's gotta give  
Something's gotta give  
Something's gotta, something's gotta give

I used to walk with you  
Along the avenue  
Our hearts were carefree and gay  
How could I know I'd lose you  
Somewhere along the way?  
  
The friends we used to know  
Would always smile "hello"  
No love like our love they'd say  
Then love slipped through our fingers  
Somewhere along the way  
  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything  
You're gone and yet  
There's still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be part of me  
  
[Chorus]  
So now I look for you  
Along the avenue  
And as I wander I pray  
That some day soon I'll find you  
Somewhere along the way  
  
I should forget  
But with the loneliness of night I start remembering everything  
You're gone and yet  
There's still a feeling deep inside  
That you will always be part of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somewhere along the way

The breeze was cool  
His kiss was fire  
The night birds sang their trills  
And when the moon was gone  
Hidden by the clouds  
I put the fire out somewhere in the hills  
  
His eyes could laugh  
I saw them laugh  
His lips a world of thrills  
The moon looked down and smiled  
On a tender love to see it  
Blossoming somewhere in the hills  
  
All night long we would samba  
  
Laugh and sing with our friends  
Love can be like a samba  
Full of joy then it ends  
  
New day, new dawn  
And I have gone  
In search of other thrills  
The moon looks down and sighs  
For those laughing eyes are crying  
Silently somewhere in the hills  
  
All night long we would samba  
Laugh and sing with our friends  
Love can be like a samba  
Full of joy then it ends

Sophisticated lady, sophisticated lady  
  
She's a different lady with a different style  
  
She stands tall and steady like the eiffel tower  
  
She is hip to politics but loves her jazz  
  
She's got lots of rhythm she's got lots of class  
  
Everybody knows how she got her name, yeah  
  
Oh, ha, she wears knee length dresses with her high heel steppers  
  
She's not no back stabber but she's sure a pleaser

We used to be so very happy and we used to have so much fun  
And we used to spend our time together, we were as close as anyone  
I used to feel your every feeling, I was a part of your every dream  
  
I'm not saying that you've thrown me aside, but oh that's just the way that it
seems  
So if Ive done anything that I shouldn't have done,  
Wanna say I'm sorry, darling, I'm so sorry  
And if I said anything that I shouldn't have said, I'm sorry, sorry, yeah  
Now were just getting used to a brand new situation  
  
And I found out that temptation just wont let ya do good  
So we must sit down and talk and be for real to each other  
Cause I don't want my love for you to be misunderstood  
If Ive done anything that I shouldn't have done,  
I'm sorry, oh baby, I'm so sorry, if I said anything that I shouldn't have
said  
  
(I'm sorry) I'm sorry, I'm sorry, oh lordy I'm so sorry  
(sorry) sorry, sorry, hey (sorry), if Ive (if Ive done anything) done anything

Who's gonna take the blame tomorrow  
If we break up tonight  
If we break up  
Who's gonna stop this stupid war  
That nobody's gonna win  
The jury's still out on us  
Split decision, split in two  
By the things that came between us  
  
So unimportant now  
All of those fights  
Why do we always hurt the ones  
We care the most about  
The jury's still out on us  
Split decision, split in two  
By the things that happened  
And the dreams that came apart  
  
Do you still want me in your life  
I need to know so tell me  
Can we still make it in this life  
Or is it too late for us  
How long is time about to wait  
  
Who's gonna say they're sorry first  
And put this hurt away  
The jury's still out on us  
Split decision  
Split in  
It's not so easy putting back the pieces  
Of a broken heart  
Getting back where we started  
  
It's not so easy picking up the pieces  
Of a broken heart  
And get it back (get it back)  
Get it back (where we started) where we started  
Oh, oh, oh, no but if we hold on  
(But if we hold on) we (we can try to make it)  
Can try to make it  
(Maybe mend this heart) and get it back  
(Get it back where we started) where we started  
Oh, oh, oh (it's not so easy) it's not so easy  
picking up (picking up the pieces) the iddy bitty pieces  
(Of a broken heart)  
  
Get it back (get it back where we started)  
Get it back where we started  
But if we hold on (if we hold on)  
We're (we can try to make it) gonna make it

I hate to see that evening sun go down  
I hate to see that evening sun go down  
Cause my lovin' baby, done left this town  
  
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today  
If I feel tomorrow, like I feel today  
I'm gonna pack my trunk and make my getaway  
  
Oh, that St. Louis woman, with her diamond rings  
She pulls my man around by her apron strings  
And if it wasn't for powder and her store-bought hair  
Oh, that man of mine wouldn't go nowhere  
  
I got those St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be  
Oh, my man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea  
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me  
  
I love my man like a schoolboy loves his pie  
Like a Kentucky colonel loves his rocker and rye  
I'll love my man until the day I die, Lord, Lord  
  
I got the St. Louis blues, just as blue as I can be, Lord, Lord  
That man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea  
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me  
  
I got those St. Louis blues, I got the blues  
I got the blues, I got the blues  
My man's got a heart like a rock cast in the sea  
Or else he wouldn't have gone so far from me, Lord, Lord

Intro  
There's a silver trail of moonlight leading upward to the sky  
And the night is like a velvet lullaby  
There's a heaven of blue  
And we'll go there, just you and I  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
And climb that stairway to the stars  
With love beside us to fill the night with a song  
  
We'll hear the sound of violins  
Out yonder where the blue begins  
The moon will guide us as we go drifting along  
  
Chorus:  
Can't we sail away on a lazy daisy petal  
Over the rim of the hill?  
Can't we sail away on a little dream  
And settle high on the crest of a thrill?  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
A lovely stairway to the stars  
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you  
  
Let's build a stairway to the stars  
A lovely stairway to the stars  
It would be heaven to climb to heaven with you

You've got to learn, you've got to learn how to follow the leader  
You've got to turn, turn off your pride and you're life will be sweeter  
Love comes from God, surely, surely, surely you can see that  
If you check out your heart, there's a part that you're keeping from me  
Why don't you hold on tight, make this flight, we've got the whole night  
Saddle up your gear, have no fear, we are here, hey  
Better make it soon, give me room, come on and stand by me  
Come on and stand by, cause there is no time, no time to sit  
I'll bet you'll be quick about it, and I know you will,  
Once you learn that you can't live without it  
Lord only knows how long, how long, how long I have waited  
And the moment is near, line em up, get em ready at the gate  
We're gonna keep em' strong, moving on, we've got the whole night  
No looking back, where its at, its right now, hey  
Better make it soon, give me room, come on and stand by me  
There's gonna be no looking back, so baby, take everything you'll ever need  
Sure 'nough moving on, keep it strong, its a whole new game and a brand new
street  
You know, uh, you said you would if you could, I'll make it good to ya  
Don't you stop 'til we get to the top, hey, ninety-nine and a half just won't
do, stand by me  
Hey, hey, if its real, what you feel, come on and stand by  
Don't you stop 'til we get to the top, hey, ninety-nine and a half just won't

Come on and stand by, ha, stand by me, hey, hey, hey  
[Repeat til fade]  
Stand by me

Baby, baby I want you  
Baby, and I need you  
I'm still in love with you  
Even though you're not with me  
You never once left my mind  
I guess I'm still in love with you, oh, oh  
You seem so unreal to me  
Why can't I set you free  
Instead I carry you around in my mind  
Late at night I try walkin'  
Never feel much like talkin'  
I'm too busy thinkin' 'bout the good ole' times  
Good ole' times  
  
(Still in love) I remember (with you, baby)  
I'm still in love with you, yeah, didn't you know it

With you, baby (still in love with you)  
Oh, yeah, yeah (still in love)

In love, in love (with you) in love, in love  
In love, in love, in love, in love, oh  
(Still in love) remember me, boy

Take a look in the mirror, look at yourself  
But don't you look too close, cause you just might see the person  
That you hate the most, lord, what's happening to this human race  
I can't even see one friendly face,  
Brothers fight brothers and sisters wink their eyes  
  
While silver tongues bear fruits of poison lies,  
Take a look at your children  
Born innocent, every boy and every girl,  
Denying themselves a real chance  
  
To build a better world,  
Oh! dear lord what's happening to your precious dream  
I think it's washing away on a bloody, bloody stream,  
Yes, take a look at your children  
  
Before it's too late, and tell them nobody,  
Nobody wins when the prize is hate  
Oh, no, no, no it's not too late,  
We gotta tell all of our children  
That love, love, love is the way, yeah, yeah  

Excuse me did you call yourself a love expert  
Studied, graduated and qualified to show me what it's all about?  
Honey, talk is cheap, you gonna have to convince me  
  
Did you say, I've got a lot to learn?  
Well, don't think I'm trying not to learn  
Right here is the perfect spot to learn  
Teach me tonight  
  
Starting with the A, B, C of it  
Right down to the X, Y, Z of it  
Teach me the whole mystery of it  
Teach me tonight  
  
The sky's a blackboard high above us  
And if a shooting star should fly by  
I'll take that star and write, I love you, I love you  
A thousand times across the sky  
  
One thing isn't very clear, my love  
Should the teachers stand so near, my love?  
Graduation's almost here, my love  
Come on and teach me tonight  
  
The sky's a blackboard high above you  
And if a shooting star should fly by  
I'll take that star and write, I love you  
A thousand times across the sky  
  
One thing, one thing isn't very clear  
Should no teachers stand so near  
Graduation's almost here, my love  
Come on and teach me tonight  
Graduation's almost here, my love  
Teach me, teach me tonight

If I had to choose just one day  
To last my whole life through  
It would surely be that Sunday  
The day that I met you  
  
Newborn whippoorwills were calling from the hills  
Summer was a-coming in but fast  
Lots of daffodils were showing off their skills  
Nodding all together, I could almost hear them whisper  
"Go on, kiss him, go on and kiss him"  
  
If I had to choose one moment  
To live within my heart  
It would be that tender moment  
Recalling how we started  
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me  
That way, that Sunday, that summer  
"Go on, kiss him, go on and kiss him"  
  
And if I had to choose just one moment  
To live within my heart  
It would surely be that moment  
Recalling how we started  
Darling, it would be when you smiled at me  
That way, that Sunday, that summer  
  
(If I had to choose just one day)...

I add two and two, the most simple addition  
Then swear that the figures are lying  
I'm a much better comic, then mathematician  
'Cause I'm better on stage than at intermission  
  
And as far as the man is concerned  
If I've been burned, well I haven't learn  
I know he's around when the sky and the ground starting ringing  
I know that he's near by the thunder I hear in advance  
  
His words and his words alone  
Are the words that can start me heart singing  
And his is the only music that makes me dance  
He'll sleep and he lies in the light of two eyes  
That adore him  
  
Oh bore him it might, but he won't leave me sight  
For a glance  
In every way every single day  
I need less of myself I need more him, more him  
And his is the only music that makes dance  
Yes his is the only music that makes dance

oh, oh, oh  
Oh, yeah  
Baby, what's your hurry  
Where are you going so fast  
You can keep your motor runnin'  
But don't run out of gas  
Getting there is half the fun  
  
Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me  
And the best of my love's yet to come (yet to come)  
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you  
So take a little longer, my love can only get stronger  
(Stronger, stronger)  
  
If we're gonna climb a mountain  
We gotta take our sweet time  
When you're traveling down love's highway  
Don't you know speeding is a crime  
Listen, getting there is half the fun  
Cause you've got the rest of the night to hold me  
And the best of my love's yet to come (yet to come)  
For the rest of my life I'm gonna love you  
So take a little longer  
  
My love can only get stronger (stronger, stronger)  
Oh, my Baby, we gotta slow down (ooh)  
Take your time, ease your mind (oh, Baby, mm)  
Stronger, rest of my life, I'm gonna love you  
So just take a little longer, and our love is gonna get stronger  
(Cause you've got the rest of the night) oh, yeah  
(And the best of my love) yet to come (yet to come)  
Oh, baby, for (rest of my life) I'm gonna love you  
I want you to take your time  
  
Love me baby, love me baby, love me, love me (rest of my life)  
Slow down baby, I ain't going no where (best of my love)  
So why don't we just take our sweet time (rest of my life)  
Don't rush me, you're gonna crush me, let the feeling come  
Oh, remember that song about a slow hand (rest of the night)  
  
Now she had the right idea (oh)  
So, Baby, what's the hurry, (best of my love)  
we've got forever  
If we don't use it up too fast (oh, ah)  
Take it slow, calm down, smell the roses  
We'll get there, don't you worry  
(Rest of the night, to hold me) (best of my love, yet to come)

Written by Pam Reswick, Steve Werfel  
Though I think I really know you  
And you think you know me  
And we're as close at two people  
Could ever hope to be  
Still I can't escape the feeling  
That no matter what I do  
I'll never understand what it feels like to be you  
I get the urge to know you better  
To make our spirits one  
I want to see us be together  
As close as we can come  
I get the urge to merge  
I get the urge to merge with you  
I get the urge to merge  
I get the urge to merge with you  
Have you ever wanted something  
You just had to possess  
And it turned into obsession  
And wouldn't let you rest  
There are times I can't help wishing  
I could melt right into you  
Hear every word you're thinking  
Feel everything you do  
I feel trapped inside my body  
And there's nothing I can do  
Want to leap across the wall  
That's keeping me from you  
To break what can't be broken  
To say what can't be spoken  
If only for a moment  
To touch your soul  
I get the urge to know you better  
  
  

Ohh, there's a lull in my life  
It's just a void, an empty space  
When you are not in my embrace  
  
Ohh, there's a lull in my life  
The moment that you go away  
There is no night, there is no day  
  
The clock stops ticking  
The world stops turning, everything stops  
But the flame in my heart  
That keeps burning, burning  
  
Ohh, there's a lull in my life  
No matter how I may pretend  
I know that you alone can end  
  
The ache in my heart  
The call of my arms  
The lull in my life  
  
Oh, the clock it stops ticking  
And the world just stops turning, everything stops  
But the flame in my heart  
That keeps burning, burning  
  
Oh, there's a lull in my life  
No matter how I may pretend  
I know that you alone can end  
  
This ache in my heart  
The call of my arms  
The lull in my life  
There's a lull in my life

This heart is your heart  
And can't nobody take it away  
Ooh no, this heart is your heart  
And can't nobody take it away from me  
Ooh no, no, no, no, just can't take my love away  
I give my heart to you to have and keep  
May it pleasure your desires  
And keep our love from getting weak  
We'll keep the fire burning and our love wheel turning  
You can surely have my all, all you have to do is call

No, no, never, never, never, never take it away from me  
Oh, ho, our love will always be so safe and sound  
Always lifting you up, never letting you down  
The guys will come and go, making scenes rather sad  
But I let them all know just how it is (just how it is)  
Oh just how it is (just how it is)  
Yeah, I knew the day that I first met you boy, ooh, hoo  
That it would be hard to leave you, a rah, na, na, dah  
Now that I know that I have you boy, you know  
I thank God that I'll never, never, never, never have to  
Yes I do (thank God I'll never, never, never, never have to)

To whom it may concern  
You found another love I know  
To whom it may concern  
My heart won't ever let you go  
You tore my heart apart  
When you found somebody new  
But you found out that your heart could be broken too  
So to whom it may concern  
You've learned that heartache has no pride  
  
Pretending unconcerned won't stop those tears you try to hide  
And when you're all alone with just a memory  
That's when I'll bet you'll learn the one who's most concerned is me  
And when you're all alone with just a memory  
  
That's when I'll bet you'll learn the one who's most concerned is me

They tried to tell us we're too young  
Too young to really be in love  
They say that loves a word  
A word we've only heard  
But can't begin to know  
The meaning of  
  
And yet we're not too young to know  
This love will last though years may go  
And then some day they may recall  
We were not too young at all  
  
And yet we're not too young to know  
That this love will last though years may go  
And then some day they may recall  
We were not too young at all

Unforgettable  
That's what you are  
Unforgettable  
Tho' near or far  
Like a song of love that clings to me  
How the thought of you does things to me  
Never before has someone been more  
Unforgettable in every way  
And forever more, that's how you'll stay  
That's why darling it's incredible  
That someone so unforgettable  
Thinks that I am unforgettable too  
  
Unforgettable in every way  
And forever more, that's how you'll stay  
That's why darling it's incredible  
That someone so unforgettable  
Thinks that I am unforgettable too

I'd wait for you  
I'd slave for you  
I'd be a beggar  
Or a knave for you  
If that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
I'd gladly move  
The earth for you  
To prove my love, dear  
And its worth for you  
I that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
With all the words  
Dear, at my command  
I just can't make  
You understand  
I'll always love you  
Darling  
Come what may  
My heart is yours  
What more can I say?  
  
I'd lie for you  
I'd sigh for you  
I'd tear the stars  
Down  
From the sky for you  
If that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along  
  
With all the words  
Dear, at my command  
I just can't make  
You understand  
I'll always  
Love you baby  
Come what may  
My heart is yours  
What more can I say?  
  
I'd lie for you  
I'd cry for you  
I'd lay my body down  
And die tor you  
If that isn't love  
It will have to do  
Until the real thing  
Comes along

The very thought of you and I forget to do  
The little ordinary things that everyone ought to do  
I'm living in a kind of daydream  
I'm happy as a king  
And foolish though it may seem  
To me that's everything  
  
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you  
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you  
I see your face in every flower  
Your eyes in stars above  
It's just the thought of you  
The very thought of you, my love  
  
The mere idea of you, the longing here for you  
You'll never know how slow the moments go till I'm near to you  
I see your face in every flower  
Your eyes in stars above  
It's just the thought of you  
The very thought of you, my love

When you're the best of friends  
Having so much fun together  
You're not even aware, you're such a funny pair  
You're the best of friends  
Life's a happy game  
You could clown around forever  
Neither one of you sees, your natural boundaries  
Life's one happy game  
If only the world wouldn't get in the way  
If only people would just let you play  
They say you're both being fools  
You're breaking all the rules  
They can't understand, the magic of your wonderland  
Hu-hu-hu  
When you're the best of friends  
Sharing all that you discover  
When that moment has past, will that friendship last?  
Who can say? There's a way!  
Oh I hope... I hope it never ends  
'Cause you're the best of friends  
  

What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is give you all I have and be right here with you  
  
Something happened on the way  
Something I don't want to lose  
Stared my heart right in the face  
Telling me the truth, telling me it to you  
  
What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is be right here with you  
I know that I need to give you all I am  
And this time we make it stand, stand right here with you  
  
Of all the things I wanted most  
Here you are, the one I need  
Now for all the times, I did not know  
So let my love go free, now I speak  
  
What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is be right here with you  
I know that I, I need to give you all I am  
And this time make it stand, stand right here with you  
  
You are the sun, you are the rain  
You are the one I'd love again  
And I won't ever stop this chance to be with you  
No, I won't ever stop, I know what I must do  
There's one thing I must do  
  
What I must do to hold you in my hands  
Is give you all I am and be right here with you  
I know that I, I need to, I need to give this all I can  
And this time make it stand, stand right here with you  
  
I'm gonna do that  
I know what I must do  
I know what I must do  
You are the sun, you are the rain  
You are the one, I must do  
  
Cause you are my life, you are my love  
I know what I must do  
And this I must do for you, I must do that  
Said, I'ma gonna do that, baby  
I'm gonna stand right here with you

When I fall in love it will be forever  
Or I'll never fall in love  
In a restless world like this is  
Love is ended before it's begun  
And too many moonlight kisses  
Seem to cool in the warmth of the sun  
  
When I give my heart it will be completely  
Or I'll never give my heart  
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you.  
  
And the moment I can feel that you feel that way too  
Is when I fall in love with you.

With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
Can it be true, I'm holding you close to my heart?  
With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
You're with me now, sharing a vow never to part  
  
When I'm so afraid  
To close my eyes  
Afraid that I'll find  
This lovely thrill is just a silly illusion  
  
With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
Do I deserve such a break?  
Pinch me to prove I'm awake  
'Cause I can't believe that you're really mine  
  
I'm so afraid  
This is just an illusion  
  
With my eyes wide open, I'm dreaming  
Do I deserve such a break?  
Please, pinch me to prove I'm awake  
I can't believe that you're really mine  
  
You're really mine  
Am I dreaming? I must be dreaming  
With my eyes wide open  
Eyes wide open

You go to my head  
And you linger  
Like a haunting refrain  
And I find you  
Spinning 'round  
In my brain  
Like the bubbles  
In a glass of champagne  
  
You go to my head  
Like a sip  
Of sparkling Burgundy brew  
And I find  
The very mention of you  
Like the kicker  
In a julep or two  
  
The thrill of the thought  
That you might  
Give a thought to my plea  
Casts a spell over me  
Still I say to myself  
"Get a hold of yourself"  
"Can't you see  
That it never can be?"  
  
You go to my head  
With a smile  
That makes  
My temperature rise  
Like a summer  
With a thousand July's  
You intoxicate my soul  
With your eyes  
  
Though I'm certain  
That this heart of mine  
Hasn't a ghost  
If a chance  
In this crazy romance  
You go to my head  
You go to my head

Listen as your day unfolds  
Challenge what the future holds  
Try and keep your head up to the sky  
  
Lovers, they may cause you tears  
Go ahead release your fears  
Stand up and be counted  
Don't be ashamed to cry

Leaving you behind if you can't stand the pace

The best part is danger staring you in the face
