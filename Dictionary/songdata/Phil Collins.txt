It's there in the eyes of the children  
In the faces smiling in the windows  
You can come on out, come on open the doors  
Brush away the tears of freedom  
  
Now we're here, there's no turning back  
We have each other  
We have one voice  
  
Hand in hand we will lay the tracks  
Because the train is coming to carry you home  
  
Come dance with me  
Come on and dance into the light  
Everybody dance into the light  
  
There'll be no more hiding in shadows of fear  
There'll be no more chains to hold you  
The future is yours - you hold the key  
And there are no walls with freedom  
  
Now we're here, we won't go back  
We are one world  
We have one voice  
  
Side by side we are not afraid  
Because the train is coming to carry you home  
  
Come dance with me  
Come on and dance into the light  
Everybody dance into the light  
  
Do you see the sun, it's a brand new day  
Oh, the world's in your hands, now use it  
What's past is past, don't turn around  
Brush away the cobwebs of freedom  
  
Now we're here, there's no turning back  
You have each other  
You have one voice  
  
Hand in hand you can lay the tracks  
Because the train is coming to carry you home  
  
Come dance with me  
Come on and dance into the light  
Everybody dance into the light

You keep on walking so you don't fall down  
It's the same old story  
You keep on hiding so you can't be found  
It's the same old story  
Oh but I know you, you're the one who ran  
You know why, it's because you can, oh  
It's alright, 'cause I don't mind  
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why  
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
  
My friends keep falling and they can't get up  
It's the same old story  
Well one says white and the other one black  
It's the same old story  
And I don't know why you keep emotions walled up  
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up  
But it's alright, 'cause I don't mind  
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why  
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
  
Things can change, from a misunderstanding  
Nobody talks, nobody hears, oh oh oh  
Makes me wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
  
You keep on looking for that higher ground  
It's the same old story  
Your glass is empty and the chips are down  
It's the same old story  
But I don't know why, your emotions walled up  
Your heart's on your sleeve, but your sleeve is rolled up  
But it's alright, 'cause I don't mind  
I'm just trying to help, but I wonder why  
  
Doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore  
Oh I wonder why, doesn't anybody stay together anymore

Don't get me started on politicians  
And the lies they spread  
Don't even mention sex and religion  
And who they take to bed  
But if you see me running down the street  
Know where I'm running to  
I'm tired of honesty being denied us  
I'm coming looking for you  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight  
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me  
I'll hold my ground  
Wild horses won't make me  
  
Don't get me started on information  
Magazines and t.v.  
There's one man under his big umbrella  
While it's raining on you and me  
Everyday it's getting harder to judge  
Fiction from fact  
I'm tired of truth being denied me  
It's mine and I want it back  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight  
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me  
I'll hold my ground  
Wild horses won't make me  
  
Business as usual in our pressure steamer  
Where reality slips from view  
They say that we can't take it  
I think I can, can you?  
  
Don't get me started on blood and thunder  
With people flying blind  
Not caring what or who they take with them  
Or what they leave behind  
It's one mans God against another  
While the river of tears roll by  
The things they do in the name of their father  
Can someone tell me why  
  
Don't hold me down, I'm on my way  
And nothing's gonna turn me round  
Don't turn around, give it to me straight  
I'm on my way and nothing's gonna shake me  
I'll hold my ground  
Don't get me started

You were lonely and you needed a friend  
And he was there at the right time with the right smile  
Just a shoulder to lean on  
Someone to tell you it'll all work out alright  
  
Don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
Don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
You can look at him the way you did me  
And hold him close say you're never letting go  
But any fool can see you're fooling yourself  
But you ain't fooling me  
  
So don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back  
And don't take my pictures off a' the wall  
Oh, did you hear me?  
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back  
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life  
And just give me one more chance  
I'll show you I'm right, I'm right  
  
Cause I've been thinking and I know it was me leaving you lonely  
But hoping you could be strong  
But could you look at me straight  
Tell me what else can I do but say I was wrong?  
  
So don't let him steal your heart away  
No, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
Well he's gonna try to make it work for you  
Make you think your whole life's been leading to this  
But whatever you do  
Think about me and don't be fooled by his kiss  
  
And don't let him steal your heart away  
Please, don't let him steal your heart away  
  
And don't pack my suitcase, I'll be back  
And don't take my pictures off a' your wall  
Oh, did you hear me?  
Don't let him change a thing 'cause I'll be back  
Just tell him to pack his things and get out of your life  
And just give me one more chance  
I'll show you I'm right  
You know I'm right  
  
You were lonely and you needed a friend  
And he was there at the right time with the right smile  
Just a shoulder to lean on  
Someone to say don't you worry it'll all be alright  
But he's no good for you  
He'll make you think your whole life's been leading to this  
And whatever you do  
Think about me, oh, and don't be fooled by his kiss

They came at night leaving fear behind  
Shadows were on the ground  
Nobody knew where to find him  
No evidence was found  
'I'm never coming back'  
They heard him cry  
And I believe him  
Well he never meant to do anything wrong  
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long  
  
Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
'Cause you're not anywhere  
That I can find you  
Oh now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh no  
  
Searching through the day and into the night  
They wouldn't stop till they found him  
They didn't know him and they didn't understand  
They never asked him why  
'Get out of my way'  
They heard him shout  
Then a blinding light  
Ooh all I could see was him running down the street  
Out of the shadows and into the night  
  
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
'Cause you're not anywhere  
That I can find you, oh  
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh  
  
Don't give up  
Keep running, keep hiding  
Don't give up  
Billy, if you know you're right  
Don't give up  
You know that I am on your side  
Don't give up  
Oh Billy, you better, you better, you better run for your life  
  
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
'Cause you're not anywhere  
That I can find you, oh  
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh  
  
They came at night leaving fear behind  
Shadows were on the ground  
Nobody knew where to find him  
No evidence was found  
'I'm never coming back'  
They heard him cry  
And I believe him  
He never meant to do anything wrong  
It's gonna get worse if he waits too long  
  
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
'Cause you're not anywhere  
That I can find you, oh  
Now Billy, Billy don't you lose my number  
'Cause you're not anywhere that I can find you, oh

Somewhere down the road, you're gonna find a place  
It seems so far, but it never is  
You won't need to stay, but you might lose your strength  
On the way  
  
Sometimes you may feel you're the only one  
Cause all the things you thought were safe, now they're gone  
But you won't be alone, I'll be here to carry you along  
Watching you 'til all your work is done  
  
When you find your heart, you'd better run with it  
Cause when she comes along, she could be breaking it  
No there's nothing wrong, you're learning to be strong  
Don't look back  
She may soon be gone, no don't look back  
She's not the only one, remember that  
  
If your heart is beating fast, then you know she's right  
If you don't know what to say, well, that's all right  
You don't know what to do?  
Remember she is just as scared as you  
  
Don't be shy, even when it hurts to say  
Remember, you're gonna get hurt someday, anyway  
Then you must lift your head, keep it there  
Remember what I said  
I'll always be with you don't forget  
Just look over your shoulder I'll be there.  
  
If you look behind you, I will be there.

I think I'm goin' back  
To the things I learned so well in my youth  
I think I'm returning to  
Those days when I was young enough to know the truth  
  
Now there are no games to only pass the time  
No more electric trains, no more trees to climb  
But thinking young and growing older is no sin  
And I can play the game of life to win  
  
I can recall a time  
When I wasn't ashamed to reach out to a friend  
Now, I think I've got  
A lot more than just my toys to lend  
  
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide  
But every day can be a magic carpet ride  
A little bit of courage is all we lack  
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back  
  
Now there's more to do than watch my sailboat glide  
But every day can be a magic carpet ride  
A little bit of courage is all we lack  
So catch me if you can, I'm goin' back

When the earth was young  
And the air was sweet  
And the mountains kissed the sky  
In the far beyond, with its many paths  
Man and nature lived side by side  
but great wisdom does not come without learning  
And great vision not only with our eyes  
We can think that we see  
Truly see all around us  
But when we look  
Do we see with open minds?  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
Teach our children to look deeper than the surface  
See the world through another's eyes  
For to be blind beyond yourself  
Is to look but not see it  
Knowing much is not enough to be wise  
To see the wonder  
In all we've been given  
In a world that's not always as it seems  
On the path that we choose  
Turn every corner  
Follow one, for another begins  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
Great Spirits of all who lived before  
Take our hands and lead us  
Fill our hearts and souls with all you know  
The key to understanding  
Is to see through others' eyes  
Find a way to help us  
See from all sides  
Truly see from all sides  
See from all sides

You've gotta shout if you've got something to say  
I know it's getting bad, you read it every day  
And you, you can try your best to fight it  
But you can't make it on your own  
  
Someone better tell the people up there  
I think they ought to know, the bubble's just about to bust  
Tell them they'd better beware  
The word is on the street, get up on your feet, and shout out  
  
The kids out there don't know how to react  
The streets are getting tough and that's a matter of fact  
And I, I can't take it any longer  
But we can't make it on our own  
  
The people there find it hard to relate  
They don't know how it feels to be standing there on your own  
Believe me, it's never too late  
It's time to make a move, get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop, look down, everybody, do you see what's going on  
Around you, stop  
  
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud  
Shout out, shout it out, shout loud  
  
There are people who give and there are people who take  
But I believe it's gonna get better  
Realize what a difference you make  
And don't turn away, hey! I'm talking to you!  
  
So there's only the one solution  
Stop and think what's going on  
You can draw your own conclusions  
But we won't make it on our own  
  
Someone better tell the people up there  
I think they ought to know  
The bubble's just about to burst  
Tell them they'd better beware  
The word is on the street  
Get up on your feet and shout  
  
Stop, look down, everybody  
Do you see what's going on  
Around you, stop

Well you can tell ev'ryone I'm a down disgrace  
Drag my name all over the place.  
I don't care anymore.  
You can tell ev'rybody 'bout the state I'm in  
You won't catch me crying cause I just can't win.  
I don't care anymore I don't care anymore  
  
I don't care what you say  
I don't play the same games you play.  
  
Cause I've been talking to the people that you call your friends  
And it seems to me there's a means to and end.  
They don't care anymore.  
And as for me I can sit here and bide my time  
I got nothing to lose if I speak my mind.  
I don't care anymore I don't care no more  
  
I don't care what you say  
We never played by the same rules anyway.  
  
I won't be there anymore  
Get out of my way  
Let me by  
I got better things to do with my time  
I don't care anymore I don't care anymore  
I don't care anymore I don't care anymore  
  
Well, I don't care now what you say  
Cause ev'ry day I'm feeling fine with myself  
And I don't care now what you say  
Hey I'll do alright by myself  
Cause I know.  
  
Cause I remember all the times I tried so hard  
And you laughed in my face cause you held all the cards.  
I don't care anymore.  
And I really ain't bothered what you think of me  
Cause all I want of you is just a let me be.  
I don't care anymore D'you hear? I don't care no more  
  
I don't care what you say  
I never did believe you much anyway.  
  
I won't be there no more  
So get out of my way.  
Let me by  
I got better things to do with my time  
I don't care anymore  
D'you hear? I don't care anymore  
I don't care no more  
You listening? I don't care no more  
No more!  
  
You know I don't care no more!

It's over, oh yes it's all over  
And it's been a long time coming  
Some say it's too long  
She said it, and now she'll regret it  
But if she'd ask anyone  
I know they'll tell her to her face, that it's too late  
  
Cause I don't want to know  
No, I don't want to know  
She can cry all she wants  
She's not gonna bring me back, no no  
I don't want to know  
I don't want to know  
She can try all she wants  
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no  
  
They warned me  
Oh yes they all warned me  
They told me, don't lose your heart to her  
She'll never give it back, no no  
Oh it's too late  
She made a big mistake  
It wouldn't be the first one anyway  
Tell me how many more, no no no  
  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
She can cry all she wants  
She's not gonna bring me back, no no

She can try all she wants  
It's not gonna get me back, oh oh, no no  
  
It's over  
Oh oh it's all over  
And it's been a long time coming  
Some say it's too long, oh oh  
They warned me

They told me, now don't lose your head to her  
She'll never give it back, no no, no no

I don't want to know (what she said)  
No I don't want to know (what she said)  
She can try all she wants  
She's not gonna bring me back, no no

I look out the window every day, I see the world go by  
Watching I sit and wait for you  
Just hoping you'll catch my eye  
You see me stare but I don't care  
I like the way you smile  
One day I'll get to talk to you  
Ooh, right now well I'm too shy  
  
But in my world of make believe  
You're the one what I need, oh, oh...  
  
I could imagine me with you  
But it's an impossibility  
I'd love to try to realise, I gotta deal with reality  
But if you turn my way, I'd look away, ooh even face-to-face  
And deep inside me, inside my mind  
Someone else is trying to take my place  
  
But in my world of make believe  
You're the one what I need, oh, oh...  
Oh, come with me, I'll show you everything  
Come with me, ooh  
Come with me, I'll show you everything  
It could be, come along with me and let me take you there, oh, oh...  
  
I look out the window every day, I see the world go by  
Watching I sit and wait for you  
Ooh, just hoping that you'll walk by  
But if you turn my way, I'd look away, ooh even face-to-face  
And deep inside, ooh in my mind  
Someone else is trying to take my place  
  
In my world of make believe  
You're the one what I need, oh, oh...  
  
Come with me, ooh  
Come with me, I'll show you everything  
It could be, come along with me and let me take you there, oh, oh...  
  
All of my life, come with me, come with me, come with me...  
All of my life...  
I like the way you smile  
All of my life...

So you finally came right out and said it girl  
What took you so long  
It was in your eyes, that look's been there for too long  
I'm waiting in line  
Would you say if I was wasting my time  
  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
  
I think about it from time to time  
When I'm lonely and on my own  
  
I try to forget and yet, still rush to the telephone  
I'm waiting in line  
Would you say if I was wasting my time  
  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
  
Well it feels like something you want so bad  
Then you think you've got it, but it's something you already had  
You can feel it all around you, but it's something you just can't touch  
And I feel it coming at me  
I can feel it coming at me  
  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again oh  
Or did I miss again  
I think I missed again  
  
I'm waiting in line, but would you say if I was wasting my time  
  
Or did I miss again.

You know I never meant to see you again  
But I only passed by as a friend... yeah  
All this time I stayed out of sight  
I started wondering why  
  
Now I... ooo now I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain on me  
  
You said you didn't need me in your life  
Oh I guess you were right... yeah  
Ooo I never meant to cause you no pain  
But it looks like I did it again... yeah  
  
Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain, rain down on me now  
Ooo girl I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain on me  
  
Though your hurt is gone, mine's hanging on inside  
And I know... well it's eating me through, it's eating me through every night
and day  
I'm just waiting on your sign  
  
'Coz I know, I know... I never meant to cause you no pain  
And I realize I let you down... ooo yeah  
But I know in my heart of hearts  
I know I'm never gonna hold you again, no  
  
Now I... now I know I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Oh you know I wish it would rain, rain down on me now  
Ooo yes I wish it would rain down, down on me  
Yes you know I wish it would rain down, rain down over me  
Just rain down over me  
Just let it rain down, let it rain down, let it rain down... ooo yeah  
Let it rain down  
Rain down over me  
Just let it rain down  
Just let it rain down  
Let it rain down  
Just let it rain

I read all the letters, I read each word that you've sent to me  
And though it's past now, and the words start to fade  
All the memories I have start, still remain  
  
I've kept all the pictures, but I hide my feelings so no-one knows  
Oh sure my friends all come round, but I'm in a crowd on my own  
It's 'cause you're gone now, but your heart, still remains  
And it'll be here if you come again  
  
You see, I'd heard the rumors, I knew before you let me know  
But I didn't believe it, not you,  
No you would not let me go  
Seems I was wrong, but I love, I love you the same  
And that's the one thing that you can't take away but just remember.  
  
If leaving me is easy,  
Going back is harder.

I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
Can you feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord  
  
Well if you told me you were drowning, I would not lend a hand  
I've seen your face before my friend, but I don't know if you know who I am  
Well I was there and I saw what you did, I saw it with my own two eyes  
So you can wipe off that grin, I know where you've been  
It's all been a pack of lies  
  
And I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord  
  
Well I remember, I remember, don't worry, how could I ever forget  
It's the first time, the last time we ever met  
But I know the reason why you keep your silence up, oh no you don't fool me  
Well the hurt doesn't show, but the pain still grows  
It's no stranger to you and me  
  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
Well been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it coming in the air tonight, oh Lord  
And I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord  
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord  
  
I can feel it in the air tonight, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh Lord  
Well I've been waiting for this moment for all my life, oh Lord, oh Lord, oh
Lord

All that time I was searching, with nowhere to run to, it started me thinking,  
Wondering what I could make of my life, and who'd be waiting,  
Asking all kinds of questions, to myself, but never finding the answers,  
Crying at the top of my voice, and no one listening,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
Ooh you must believe me,  
I can feel your eyes go throught me,  
But I don't know why.  
  
Ooh I know you're going, but I can't believe  
It's the way that you're leaving,  
It's like we never knew each other at all, it may be my fault,  
I gave you too many reasons, being alone, when I didn't want to  
I thought you'd always be there, I almost believed you,  
All this time, I still remember everything you said, oh  
There's so much you promised, how could I ever forget.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
So listen, listen to me,  
I can feel your eyes go throught me  
  
It seems I've spent too long  
Only thinking about myself - oh  
Now I want to spend my life Just caring bout somebody else.  
  
Listen, you know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep.  
  
You know I love you, but I just can't take this,  
You know I love you, but I'm playing for keeps,  
Although I need you, I'm not gonna make this,  
You know I want to, but I'm in too deep...

Gently rolling Father time  
Is calling to him now,  
And though he hears him  
He looks out to sea.  
Somewhere out there lie his dreams  
A story with no ending  
And till he finds his answers  
He won't be going nowhere  
  
For him, it's not too late  
It's not too late  
For some it's never too late  
  
Quietly knocking on her door.  
He patiently stands waiting,  
And though she hears him  
She sits steadfast in her chair.  
Somewhere out there never seen  
Her hopes and dreams lie waiting,  
And till she finds an answer  
She won't be going nowhere  
  
For her, it's not too late  
It's not too late  
For some it's never too late  
  
For everything we know that's certain  
There is much we cannot see,  
So we choose to close the curtain,  
Never knowing what could have been  
  
It's not too late, it's not too late, never too late  
  
Slowly rocking the baby's bed  
He strokes it's head and whispers  
And though it hears him,  
It keeps smiling and kicks it's feet  
Somewhere out there is a life,  
A lifetime made for living  
So it holds on fast, it ain't going nowhere  
  
For some it's not too late,  
It's not too late  
For some it's never too late  
For some it's not too late  
It's not too late  
For some its never too late

Sometimes I lie awake, wondering if I'll make it out of here,  
But the wind blows round my heels, so I stay  
I remember lying there, wishing I could be someone else  
Trying to find somehow to get away.  
  
If I asked him nicely d'you think he's show me how to fly,  
Cause the dust has weighed my wings down, and I'm too tired to try.  
  
Sometimes I sit here hearing voices in my head  
I try to understand, to make some sense.  
  
I wonder if I had to, would I lie to save myself?  
A plea of guilty, but self defense.  
  
If I asked him nicely d'you think he'd show me how?  
I'm sure he's out there listening, but he's too tied up right now to try  
  
Try, all of my sins  
Cause I can't stop now,  
Just don't leave me behind.  
  
Sometimes I lie awake, wondering if I'll get out of here,  
But the words stick in my throat and I stay.  
I remember lying there, wishing I could be someone else,  
Trying to find somehow to get away  
  
If I asked him nicely d'you think he's show me how to fly,  
Cause the dust has weighed my wings down, and I'm too tired to try.

I've got sun shining on a cloudy day  
When it's cold outside  
I got the month of May  
Oh but I guess you'll say  
What can make me feel this way?  
  
It's my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
You know that I'm talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl)  
  
I've got so much honey, you know the bees envy me  
Got a sweetest song that I can sing  
The birds in the trees  
Oh but I guess you'll say  
What can make me feel this way?  
  
It's my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl)  
  
Whoo  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
I don't need no money, fortune or fame  
I've got all the riches, baby  
You know that one man alone can claim  
Oh but I guess you'll say  
What can make me feel this way?  
  
It's my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
You know that I'm talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl)  
  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
I've got sunshine on cloudy day with my girl  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl, my girl, my girl)  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
(My girl, my girl)  
  
Talkin' 'bout my girl  
My girl, my girl  
I'm talkin' 'bout my girl  
My girl

Well, the key to my survival  
Was never in much doubt  
The question was how I could keep sane  
Trying to find a way out  
  
Things were never easy for me  
Peace of mind was hard to find  
And I needed a place where I could hide  
Somewhere I could call mine  
  
I didn't think much about it  
'Til it started happening all the time  
Soon I was living with the fear everyday  
Of what might happen that night  
  
I couldn't stand to hear the crying  
Of my mother, and I remember when  
I swore that, that would be the last they'd see of me  
And I never went home again  
  
They say time is a healer  
And now my wounds are not the same  
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth  
I had to hear what he'd say  
  
He sat me down to talk to me  
He looked me straght in the eyes  
He said:  
  
You're no son, no son of mine  
You're no son, no son of mine  
You walked out, you left us behind  
And you're no son, no son of mine  
  
Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it  
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it  
  
You're no son, no son of mine  
But where should I go, and what should I do  
You're no son, no son of mine  
But I came here for help, I came here for you  
  
Well the years they passed so slowly  
I thought about him everyday  
What would I do if we passed on the street  
Would I keep running away  
  
In and out of hiding places  
Soon I'd have to face the facts  
We'd have to sit down and talk it over  
And that would mean going back  
  
They say time is a healer  
And now my wounds are not the same  
I rang the bell with my heart in my mouth  
I had to hear what he'd say  
  
He sat me down to talk to me  
He looked me straght in the eyes  
He said:  
  
You're no son, no son of mine  
You're no son, no son of mine  
When you walked out, you left us behind  
And you're no son, no son of mine  
  
Oh, his words how they hurt me, I'll never forget it  
And as the time, it went by, I lived to regret it  
  
You're no son, no son of mine  
But where should I go, and what should I do  
You're no son, no son of mine  
But I came here for help, I was looking for you

'I never meant to break your heart, please forgive me.'  
  
No I never meant to hold you back  
I never meant to turn away  
Please forgive me  
  
I never meant to break your heart  
I'd give my last breath before I do  
Please forgive me  
  
No I never meant to hold you down  
I never meant to break your heart  
Somehow, somehow  
We are survivors  
  
No I never meant to hold you back  
I never meant to turn away  
Here we are standing here  
Survivors in the night  
  
No I never meant to break your heart  
I'll always be here for you  
Here's my word, take my hand  
Survivors in the night  
  
No I never meant to let you down  
I'd give my last breath before I do  
All I ever wanted was to be right here  
Survivors in the night  
  
When all is said and done  
We'll find a way  
To put all this behind us  
We'll find some way  
Cause you know that I won't be leaving  
Yes I'm here and I won't be leaving  
  
No I never meant to cause you pain  
No I never meant to hurt you  
All I want to do now, is to try my best  
Survivors in the night  
  
When all is said and done  
We'll find someday  
We can forget all this  
Somehow, some way  
  
And as long as I'm here  
There'll be no worries any more  
And all these promises I'm making now  
I'll hold each day  
  
So don't ever, don't ever, don't forget  
That I never, never meant to break your heart  
All I ever wanted was to stand beside you  
Survivors in the night  
  
We are survivors in the night

The sun is rising in the sky  
Here we're waiting, standing by  
Round in circles, round and round  
Pulse is racing, can't sit down  
The noise of people fills the air  
Search for silence goes nowhere  
Time just passes, starts to rain  
I look at you and I feel your pain  
  
Day after day watching it grow, counting the time  
In each and every way the pleasure is mine  
Through all of the high times  
Through all of the low times  
The farther we reach, the farther we see  
The farther we go  
  
Time after time waiting for you, when will you come  
Wanting to play the game we've begun  
Through all of the high times  
Through all of the low times  
The more we can give, the more we can keep  
The more there will be  
  
Like the man said he was right  
'Bout something coming in the air tonight  
Well if it's coming, let it be now  
I feel it's close, I just know somehow  
I can't hold on much longer  
My head is filled with wonder  
But if these things don't come to pass  
I'll bring you water and fill your glass  
  
Everyday the stronger it grows, it's easy to see  
Getting to feel how good it can be  
Through all of the high times  
Through all of the low times  
The more that we teach, the better we learn  
The better we'll be

Seems I've lingered too long in the darkness  
Unlock the door, turn the light on and wait.  
I should know better than to rest on a promise  
But this body before you has seen too much pain.  
  
Take me down, take me down to the water,  
Take my hand, learn me all I should know.  
Here I am, I'm waiting for you  
Just give me a sign, oh please don't fail me now.  
  
It's at this time we feel the emotion,  
Nothing is wasted, nothing is lost.  
I'm sure that I've been here before sometime  
Some bridges are reached but never are crossed.  
  
Take me down, take me down to the water,  
Take my hand, learn me all I should know.  
Here I am, I'm waiting for you  
Just give me a sign, oh please don't fail me now.  
  
Take me down, take me down to the water,  
Take my hand, learn me all I should know.  
Here I am, I'm waiting for you  
Just give me a sign, oh please don't fail me now.  
  
Don't fail me now  
Cause it's out of my control.  
I'm coming with you,  
I'm right beside you,  
Oh feet don't fail me now.  
  
Seems I've lingered too long in the darkness  
Unlock the door, turn the light on and wait.  
I should know better than to rest on a promise  
But this body before you has seen too much pain.  
  
Take me down, take me down to the water,  
Take my hand, learn me all I should know.  
Here I am, I'm waiting for you  
Just give me a sign, don't let me go.  
Take me down, take me down to the water,  
Take my hand, learn me all I should know.  
Here I am, I'm waiting for you  
Just give me a sign, oh feet please don't fail me now.

Take that look of worry  
I'm an ordinary man  
They don't tell me nothing  
So I find out what I can  
There's a fire that's been burning  
Right outside my door  
I can't see but I feel it  
And it helps to keep me warm  
So I, I don't mind  
No I, I don't mind  
  
Seems so long I've been waiting  
Still don't know what for  
There's no point escaping  
I don't worry anymore  
I can't come out to find you  
I don't like to go outside  
They can't turn off my feelings  
Like they're turning off a light  
But I, I don't mind  
No I, I don't mind  
Oh I, I don't mind  
No I, I don't mind  
  
So take, take me home  
Cos I don't remember  
Take, take me home  
'Cause I don't remember  
Take, take me home  
'Cause I don't remember  
Take, take me home, oh lord  
'Cause I've been a prisoner all my life  
And I can say to you  
  
Take that look of worry, mine's an ordinary life  
Working when it's daylight  
And sleeping when it's night  
I've got no far horizons  
I don't wish upon a star  
They don't think that I listen  
Oh but I know who they are  
And I, I don't mind  
No I, I don't mind  
Oh I, I don't mind  
No I, I don't mind  
  
So take, take me home  
'Cause I don't remember  
Take, take me home  
'Cause I don't remember  
Take, take me home  
'Cause I don't remember  
Take, take me home, oh lord  
Well I've been a prisoner all my life  
And I can say to you  
  
But I don't remember  
Take, take me home.

All day long he was fighting for you  
And he didn't even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
And I don't know why  
Why do we keep holding on  
I don't know why  
Pretending to be oh so strong  
Oh why  
Is there something I don't know  
Or something very wrong, with you and me  
Or maybe  
  
That's the way it is, there's nothing I can do,  
That's just the way it is.  
  
They've been waiting for word to come down  
They've been waiting for you night and day  
They won't wait any longer for you  
It may already be too late  
  
And I don't know why.  
  
You see the dying, you feel the pain  
What have you got to say  
If we agree that we can disagree  
We could stop all of this today  
  
It's been your life for as long as you can remember  
But you cannot fight no more  
You must want to look your son in the eyes  
When he asks you what you did it for  
  
'Cos all day long he was fighting for you  
And he didn't even know your name  
Young men come and young men go  
But life goes on just the same  
  
I don't know why...

Come gather 'round people wherever you roam,  
And admit that the waters around you have grown,  
And accept it that soon you'll be drenched to the bone  
If your time to you is worth savin'  
Then you better start swimmin'  
Or you'll sink like a stone  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come writers and critics who prophecize with your pen  
And keep your eyes wide,  
The chance won't come again,  
And don't speak too soon  
For the wheel's still in spin  
And there's no tellin' who  
That it's namin'  
For the loser now  
Will be later to win  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come senators, congressmen,  
Please heed the call  
Don't stand in the doorway,  
Don't block the hall,  
For he that' gets hurt  
Will be he who has stalled,  
There's a battle  
Outside and it's ragin'  
It'll soon shake your windows  
And rattle your walls  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
Come mothers and fathers  
Throughout the land,  
And don't criticize  
What you can't understand  
Your sons and your daughters  
Are beyond your command,  
Your old road is rapidly agin',  
Please get out of the new one  
If you can't lend your hand  
For the times they are a-changin'  
  
The line it is drawn,  
The curse it is cast,  
The slow one now will  
Later be fast,  
As the present now  
Will later be past  
The order is rapidly fadin'  
And the first one now  
Will later be last  
For the times they are a-changin'

Some day, when I'm awfully low,  
When the world is cold,  
I will feel a glow just thinking of you...  
And the way you look tonight.  
Oh but you're lovely, with your smile so warm  
And your cheek so soft,  
There is nothing for me but to love you,  
And the way you look tonight.  
With each word your tenderness grows,  
Tearing my fear apart...  
And that laugh that wrinkles your nose,  
Touches my foolish heart.  
Lovely ... Never, ever change.  
Keep that breathless charm.  
Won't you please arrange it?  
'Cause I love you  
Just the way you look tonight.

It must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
  
Well I wait in every day, just in case,  
You decide to call  
And I can hardly wait,  
'Coz I never thought time could pass so slowly  
  
It must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
  
Happiness is something I never thought I'd feel again,  
But now I know  
It's you that I've been looking for  
And day by day more and more  
I know what you think, you've heard it before  
Don't tell me I know  
But this feeling inside my heart,  
You know I'm never letting go  
Cause I think that  
  
It must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
  
Words can only say so much  
It's hard to express  
The things you do to me  
You're everything I could've ever dreamed you'd be  
  
This must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love  
Oh this must be love, I'm feeling  
This must be love

It's never where you think you'll find it  
The thing you think you're looking for  
It could take you all your lifetime  
And still you'd never quite be sure  
  
You could look everywhere  
Because you know it's there  
Somewhere beneath the sky  
But too close and you'll get burned  
There's no lesson learned  
Yet some people pass it by  
  
You'll see things different when you look through my eyes  
Things are different if you see what I see  
Just look closely and you'll see through my eyes  
It could be different, you'll see how it could be,  
If you can see  
  
You may need help to find your way home  
Those who brought you here have flown  
The road you take is full of hope or sadness  
The choice you make will be your own  
  
But you're not alone in there  
Just say hello in there  
Cause there are many just like you  
They'll help you find someway  
To make it all the way  
They'll tell you all you have to do  
  
You'll see things different when you look through my eyes  
Things are different if you see what I see  
Just look closely and you'll see through my eyes  
It could be different, you'll see how it could be,  
If you can see  
  
No one warns you of the heartache  
No one can hide you from the storm  
But from the shadows there will come the sunshine  
A place to dry and keep you warm  
  
Though no one tells you how  
Your hearts beating faster now  
Getting stronger day by day  
  
Suddenly it's clear, what you seek is near  
It's what you learn along the way  
  
Its never where you think you'll find it  
The thing you think you 're looking for  
Well it could take you all your lifetime  
Still you'll never quite be sure  
You'll find it, just look closer

I never thought I'd ever get tired of playing games  
But I've been holding back for too long  
Now the time has come to get it right  
Now's the time to show them all that they're wrong  
  
'Cos they said thunder and they said lightning  
It would never strike twice  
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me  
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels alright  
  
Never ever did believe in guiding lights  
'Cos what you didn't hold, slipped away  
Oh but there's a feeling deep down in my shoe  
'Cos things look like they're going my way  
  
'Cos they say thunder and they say lightning  
It would never strike twice  
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me  
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels alright  
  
I never ever did believe in a second chance  
You get, just one crack of the whip, that's all  
If you played the game, you got treated right  
Oh but I'm not playing the game, no more  
  
'Cos they say thunder and they say lightning  
It would never strike twice  
Oh but if that's true, why can't you tell me  
How come this feels so nice, Oh it feels alright

Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream  
It is not dying, it is not dying.  
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void  
It is shining, oh it is shining.  
That you may see the meaning of within  
It is beginning, oh it is beginning.  
  
That love is all and love is ev'ryone  
It is knowing, oh it is knowing.  
And ignorance and hate may mourn the dead  
It is believing, oh it is believing.  
So play the game, existence to the end  
Of the beginning, of the beginning.  
  
Of the beginning, of the beginning...  
  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I dreamed of once in a lullaby  
  
(okay-)

Come with me  
I'll take you now,  
To a place that you feel,  
For no reason why, your heart is turned away from me  
  
And I will make you, understand  
  
Everything will become clear to you  
When you see things through, another's eyes  
Everything will become clear to you  
Whatever strengthens you, you will find  
  
Come with me  
I'll take you there  
To a place, where you'll see  
Everything you need  
To be the one, you need to be  
  
And of those things, that you fear  
  
Will sever  
From you  
In time  
  
Everything will become clear to you  
When you see things through, another's eyes  
Everything will becomes clear to you  
Whatever strengthens you, you will find

You with the sad eyes  
Don't be discouraged  
Oh I realize  
It's hard to take courage  
In a world full of people  
You can lose sight of it all and the darkness,  
Inside you makes you feel so small  
  
But I see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Show me a smile then,  
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when  
I last saw you laughing  
If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Just show your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Such sad eyes  
Discouraged now  
Realize  
  
When this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through

(That's why I love you) Show me your colours  
Show me your rainbow

Well, there was no reason to believe she'd always be there  
But if you don't put faith in what you believe in  
It's getting you nowhere  
'Cos it hurts, you never let go  
Don't look down, just look up  
Cos she's always there to behind you, just to remind you  
  
Two hearts, believing in just one mind  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
  
'Cos there's no easy way to, to understand it  
There's so much of my life in her, and it's like I'm blinded  
And it teaches you to never let go  
There's so much love you'll never know  
She can reach you no matter how far  
Wherever you are  
  
Two hearts, believing in just one mind  
Beating together till the end of time  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
Together forever till the end of time  
  
She knows (she knows)  
There'll always be a special place in my heart for her  
She knows, she knows, she knows  
Yeah, she knows (she knows)  
No matter how far apart we are  
She knows, I'm always right there beside her  
  
We're two hearts, believing in just one mind  
Beating together till the end of time  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
Together forever till the end of time  
  
You know we're two hearts believing in just one mind  
Together forever, til the end of time  
Two hearts two hearts, believing in just one mind  
Beating together til the end of time

Put your faith in what you most believe in  
Two worlds, one family  
Trust your heart  
Let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see  
  
A paradise untouched by man  
Within this world blessed with love  
A simple life, they live in peace  
  
Softly tread the sand below your feet now  
Two worlds, one family  
Trust your heart  
Let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see  
  
Beneath the shelter of the trees  
Only love can enter here  
A simple life, they live in peace  
  
Raise your head up  
Lift high the load  
Take strength from those that need you  
Build high the walls  
Build strong the beams  
A new life is waiting  
But danger's no stranger here  
  
No words describe a mother's tears  
No words can heal a broken heart  
A dream is gone, but where there's hope  
  
Somewhere something is calling for you  
Two worlds, one family  
Trust your heart  
Let fate decide  
To guide these lives we see

This is your wake up call, young hearts be free  
Get up, get on, get out about and shout it  
Tell 'em all you're dressed and on your way  
Oh there's absolutely no doubt about it  
This is your wake up call  
You're gonna miss it all  
Am I the only one out there that's listening  
Cause it's such a lovely noise that I can hear  
Eyes are opening up to all around them  
This is their wake up call  
They're gonna miss it all  
Can you feel what's happening here  
Everything is changing all around you  
It's in the air, electricity  
Everybody, yes everybody's waking up  
Good morning to you  
You're not the only one out there who's running  
But the man who's sitting next to you's asleep  
So pick him up and shake him till he hears you  
This is his wake up call  
He's gonna miss it all  
Can you feel what's happening here  
Everything is changing all around you  
It's in the air, electricity  
Everybody, yes everybody's waking up  
Good morning to you  
Those who've done all they can do sleep easy  
Those that turn away, they sleep alone  
But there's no doubt about it absolutely  
This is a wake up call  
We 're gonna miss it all  
This is your wake up call  
This is your wake up call  
This is your wake up call  
You're gonna miss it  
You're gonna miss it all

'We never realize just how close we come to disaster whether in love or
everyday life'  
  
My harbor lights are fading fast  
Soon they'll disappear  
Alone I sit in darkness  
Hoping someone might come near  
Though I wait, though I try  
No one ever comes  
And the feeling that I have flood over me  
The river starts to run  
  
We fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
  
Every place you run to, everywhere you turn  
There are places that you know you should not go  
But some bridges just won't burn  
All my life, though I try  
I cannot change the past  
And the ghosts that come back to haunt you  
Make you realize at last  
  
We fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
We fly too close  
  
My heart is racing much faster now  
Life passes before my eyes  
Something's I see, they make me smile  
Something's they make me cry  
So I look, so I try to find  
A lesson I can learn  
The passing of time hasn't changed my mind  
And the ghosts I know return  
  
You know we fly so close  
We fly so close  
Sometimes we fly too close  
We fly too close  
  
We fly so close, you and I sometimes  
Sometimes we fly so close,  
We'll never know how many times  
We fly so close  
We fly so close

We said goodbye to a dear old friend  
And we packed our bags and left feeling sad  
It's the only way  
We said hello as we turned the key  
A new roof over our heads  
Gave a smile  
It's the only way  
Only way  
  
Turn your head  
And don't look back  
Set your sails for a new horizon  
Don't turn around don't look down  
Oh there's life across the tracks  
And you know it's really not surprising  
It gets better when you get there oh  
  
Well it really don't matter much where you are  
'cause home is in your heart  
It's a feeling that you wake with one day  
Some people key p running all their life  
And still find they haven't gone too far  
They don't see it's the feeling inside - the feeling inside oh  
  
Turn your head and don't look back  
Just set your sails for a new horizon  
Don't turn around don't look down  
Oh there's life across the tracks  
And you know it's really not surprising  
It gets better when you get there  
  
We said hello as we turned the key  
A new roof over our heads  
Gave a smile - it's the only way

She came looking for me with her arms open wide,  
Like some long lost friend of mine.  
  
She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me ?'  
I said 'No, I don't believe I do'  
So she looked me up and down  
And undressed me with her eyes,  
Then she said 'You've got everything I need, you've got everything I want'  
  
So I said 'OK,  
  
You can wear my hat,  
You can have my coat,  
You can take my shirt  
Cause I don't need it.  
You can wear my shoes,  
You can take my socks,  
Come on take my bag it's yours  
  
If you love it,  
You can have it if you love it,  
Ain't no problem if you love it,  
Come on take it if you love it.  
  
So her friend came up to me  
With a pen and paper in her hand,  
Expressing some interest in the number of my room,  
She said 'Excuse me, but do you remember me? '  
I said 'No,' she said 'Can I appeal to you?'  
  
So I looked her up and down  
And realizing her insinuations I blushed  
She said 'Listen babe you don't know me,  
No you don't know me but you owe me,  
  
And I love you,  
Yes I love you,  
Put your arms around me 'cause I love you,  
I got all your records and I love you'  
  
So I suggested  
  
You can wear my hat,  
You can have my coat,  
You can take my shirt  
Cause I don't need it.  
You can wear my shoes,  
You can take my socks,  
Come on take my bag it's yours  
  
If you love it,  
You can have it if you love it,  
Ain't no problem if you love it,  
Come on take it if you love it.  
  
Well later on that day this guy came to me  
With a scrap of paper in his hand  
He said 'Hey buddy can you sign your name for me?'  
I said 'Why, do I owe you money?' He said 'No'  
I said 'Listen pal do I know you? Have we ever met?  
Why do you want my name on this little piece of paper?  
  
He said 'I love you,  
I don't know you but I love you,  
Like my brother I love you,  
Put your arms around me 'cause I love you'  
  
I said 'Hey let's not rush things  
  
You can wear my hat,  
You can have my coat,  
You can take my shirt  
Cause I don't need it.  
You can wear my shoes,  
You can take my socks,  
Come on take my bag it's yours  
  
If you love it,  
You can have it if you love it,  
Ain't no problem if you love it,  
Come on take it if you love it.  
  
You can wear my hat,  
You can wear my hat,  
You can wear my hat,  
Come on wear my hat.

'It seems that family values have changed since I was a kid, at least I
remember it that way'  
  
When I grow up to be a man  
Like my father was when I was young  
I hope I can make him so proud of me  
Proud enough to call me his son  
  
What makes these people so different now  
What makes these times so strange?  
Seems most people got most everything they need  
How come we see this change  
  
Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control  
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul  
When will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer  
  
When I was a boy, did we have more respect?  
This world seemed a nicer place to be  
But time slowly passes and one day you look around  
You hardly recognize what you see  
  
Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control  
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul  
Now when will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer  
  
They're beyond our control  
  
We're all sons of our fathers  
Sometimes I feel like mine  
And I can hear him say, the things I say  
Seems all things come around in time  
  
Why these things happen we'll never know  
Guess that was then and this is now  
We always knew that change was gonna come  
But I want to go back, please tell me how  
  
Our sons and daughters seem to be beyond our control  
Their smile is fading fast, they're losing their soul  
When will we ever learn, yet I'm a believer

I know she says she wants me  
I hear it every day  
And I know she know it keeps me  
Well there ain't no other way  
But she's got a heart must be made of stone  
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
  
She says  
Who said I would  
She knows it ain't easy for a simple boy like me  
She fills me full of loving  
Oh then she sets me free  
But she's got a heart must be made of stone  
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
  
She says  
Who said I would, tell me, who said I would  
Who said I would, who said I would  
  
I'm not the only one but I do fine  
I suit her purpose and I'm just her kind  
I don't own her and I never could  
Don't think I do, don't think I should  
  
Tell me  
Who said I would, who said I would  
  
But she's got a heart must be made of stone  
And when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
  
You're not the only one but you do fine  
You suit my purpose and you're just my kind  
I don't own me and you never could  
Don't think you do, don't think you should  
  
Who said I would (who said I would)  
Now she knows when she calls me  
I'll come running every time  
And she knows she gets me hot  
But she don't know it's her body never mine  
  
And she's got a heart must be made of stone  
'Cause when I tell her that she'll miss me when I'm gone  
She says  
Who said I would, tell me, who said I would  
Who said I would, who said I would

Just as I thought I'd make it  
You walk back into my life  
Just like you never left  
  
Just as I'd learned to be lonely  
You call up to tell me  
You're not sure if you're ready  
But ready or not, you'll take what you've got and leave  
  
Leave me alone with my heart  
I'm putting the pieces back together again  
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams  
I can do without you, know what I mean  
  
I wish I could write a love song,  
To show you the way I feel  
Seems you don't like to listen  
Oh but like it or not, take what you've got and leave  
  
Leave me alone with my heart  
It's broken in two and I'm not thinking too straight  
Just leave, leave me alone with my dreams  
You've taken everything else, you know what I mean
