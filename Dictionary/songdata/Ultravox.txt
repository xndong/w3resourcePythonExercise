When I was boy  
There's a dream that I had  
That a war if was fought  
Was for good against bad  
And I woke up to find  
That the world had gone mad  
  
And we'd all fall down  
  
And I feel like a child again  
Sitting or turning  
You're toying with power  
Your fingers are burning  
You're pushing so hard  
That the worlds won't be turning  
  
We'll all fall down  
  
When you try to pretend  
That you're a god upon high  
With your party ideals  
And your squeaky clean lies  
When it comes to the crunch  
You're no smarter than I  
  
And we'll all fall down  
  
If it's colour of creed or all time religion  
Well fighting for that shows  
A pure lack of vision  
The fight that we strive  
Is a fight to survive  
  
And we'll all fall down  
  
Well look in the mirror  
And what do you see  
An American, Russian  
A soldier or me  
When you all press the buttons  
Just where will you be?  
  
When we all fall down

All the boys are wearing their utility drag  
The girls slip identikits from their utility bags  
Some refugees from suburbia are laughing  
Examining each other's gags  
Vibrate on sulphate when it gets late  
And their velocity begins to sag  
Chorus:  
And it goes on all night, all night  
And it goes on and on, the artificial life  
Mary Mary got so confused  
About the fusion game, what a game  
Blunked on booze, she talks like a newsreel  
She'll take up any kind of bleak exchange  
She turned to perfection once  
But realized she'd only turned to pain  
She ran through divine light, chemicals, Warhol, scientology, her own sex  
Before she turned away  
(Chorus)  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
I've learned to be a stranger  
Stranger still  
I should have left here years ago  
But my imagination won't tell me how  
This whirlpool's got such seductive furniture  
It's so pleasant getting drowned  
So we drink and sink and talk and stalk  
With interchangeable enemies and friends  
Trying on each other's skins  
While we're dying to be born again.  
(Chorus)

Thought I'd take the slide  
I thought I'd be alright  
But when the details swam  
Oh no, the door got jammed  
Someone took the hand  
And we were out slow dancing  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
There was a crowd below  
Swanning in the glow  
All the paste it shimmered  
In the swimmer's glimmer  
It was a sticky summer  
And I was diving under...  
The Blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  
Well nothing drove out behind me  
I was so glad  
Even the walls were turning round  
Well, someone said  
There was something wrong  
But I couldn't quite  
Put my finger on it  
What the...  
Well I thought I heard...  
And I tried to...  
Then we were just diving  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light, uh-huh  
In the blue light, blue light  
Blue light, blue light  

I can feel the turning of the tides  
Pulling away the night  
Like a sheet from over me  
In summer time  
I dissolve to a beach  
And everywhere seems to be  
Just a flicker on a silent screen  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
Let the sky roll on  
Just a flicker and the crowd moves on  
In winter  
Overcoats close in  
And the snow tastes of tin  
On the steps of any station  
I'd like to glide in the long green light  
Of a July afternoon  
Sliding down a vague conversation  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
When the moment comes  
Just a glance and the glance is gone  
Watch closely  
As a man with a hat  
And a girl with a map  
Synchronise with the track  
And they go away  
I need to drift through all the walls  
And let the scenery dissolve  
Into some other life  
Because I  
I can't stay long  
Let the sky roll on  
Just a glance and the glance is gone  
I  
I can't stay long  
When the right time comes  
I'll dissolve  

[Chorus:]  
See the man on the 'phone,  
With a gun in his hand,  
Sipping courage from a crystal cup.  
He's a man in the wrong,  
With a gun at his head,  
Pushes on and now it's time to cut and run.  
Time, passing so slowly.  
Still, as he sits and he watches the sand slip through his hands.  
He demands something more,  
Something strong,  
Something savage and pure.  
One more twist of the knife and it's time to cut and run.  
(Chorus)  
He smiles, as he draws on his last cigarette,  
And he tries to forget all that forces every move.  
He commands something new,  
Something strong,  
Something spiteful and true.  
One more twist of the knife and it's time to cut and run.  
Cries on his tape so they might understand.  
Signs his farewell with a squeeze of his hand.  
(Chorus - Repeat 4 times and fade)

[Chorus]  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm  
Dangerous rhythm in the air  
  
Stranger to stranger  
We're both dressed for danger  
Something is generating here  
  
Oh, take off your halo  
For the all-night inferno  
Something is happening in the air  
  
It's not like anything I've ever known before  
And I don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Surging and merging  
Urgent and urging  
Soft as a footstep on the stair  
  
The red light is on now  
My gravity's gone and how  
I can feel something in the air  
  
It's not like anything I've ever known before  
And I don't care  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Running down an empty street  
Perhaps it was a railway station  
Smell of ??? cologne  
The sound of a celebration  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh-oh-oh dislocation  
Oh-oh-oh dislocation  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The sun was going down one quiet evening  
Someone came into the room while I was half-asleep  
We spoke for a while, I couldn't see his face  
Later on when he was gone, I realized I didn't catch his name  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x3]  
  
Just a swimmer growing dimmer in the glimmer of a summer  
Waving gladly, swimming madly, never never going under

Your picture of yourself is a media myth  
Underneath this floor we're on the edge of a cliff  
Someone told me Jesus was the Devil's lover  
While we masturbated on a magazine cover  
[Chorus:]  
Dead in the streets  
Who's that girl?  
Ireland screams  
Africa burns  
Suburbia stumbles  
The tides are turned  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western  
The Western world  
Mama's still on valium, Daddy puts the news on  
TV orphans laugh at the confusion  
The audience finds itself on the stage  
Fifty million people in a state of decay  
(Chorus)  
The party goes on behind elevator doors  
While the elevator plummets from the 69th floor  
All the cars lost in the scrapyards of paradise  
The newspaper photographs have all come alive  
(Chorus)  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western world  
I can feel the fear in the Western  
The Western world

Marching across our own screens  
Our faces form all our needs  
The future's not returning  
All bridges built for burning  
How can there be anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
One day I'll just erase the tape, wave goodbye, and fade away  
Get lost in the frost again  
Clean the ashes of my face at the bottom of your suitcase  
Find a sunset, turn away  
How can there by anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
We walk around inside each other visiting the empty rooms  
Put me on, I'll put you on too  
You knew I'd have to follow you because you saw I'm hollow too  
But it's so nice being I too  
How can there by anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Chorus:  
We're nowhere  
We don't care who led us here  
No-one will care when we're gone  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
Too many pictures on my screen and all of them are screaming at me  
Thought I had this insulation  
The only way to stop the flood whenever feelings get too real  
Is to cut the information  
How can there be anything wrong?  
Aren't we the frozen ones?  
The frozen ones  
The frozen ones  
(Chorus)  
The frozen ones  
(Repeat and fade)

I was young and not deceived then  
I believed in the heart of the country  
How the words sound, how the truth lies  
I was moved by the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, then I saw through  
The charade, the facade,  
Now I've had it all  
When they ask you who deprives you  
You reply your heart of the country  
I am older, I am wiser  
I despise the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, then I felt it  
All the tears and the grief  
I believed it all  
Taking bad times, by the handful  
Do what you can for the heart of the country  
They dish the dirt out too hard to swallow  
Just to follow the heart of the country  
Oh, oh, heed the words  
And learn the lines  
I'll be fine when I have it all  

I, I'm moving through time  
Being human by design  
Life  
Unfulfilled but divine  
Never ending  
How could I be so blind?  
What is this world  
Doing to me?  
Notwithstanding the lies  
All the tears I have cried  
I've opened my eyes  
  
(Chorus:)  
I am alive  
I am who I want to be  
Walls are falling  
I am alive  
And this is my destiny  
The king is calling  
I am alive  
Far from the maddening crowd  
Playing mind games  
Way out loud  
Pictures of heroes  
Lined up one by one  
Embracing the future  
I have begin  
  
(Chorus)  
Passing strangers  
Artificial life  
Slowly falling  
Look out for me  
I am alive  
  
(Chorus)

We turned the dial, we heard the news and laughed, we don't know why  
We drank the wine and spoke of times we knew of days gone by  
We flicked through photographs we had, somehow they made us sad  
Remembering the times we used to have, it made us cry  
  
Oh I remember death in the afternoon  
  
A silence fell about the room with harsh and heavy calm  
The lovers and the friends all felt the same, it kept us warm  
We raised our glass and drank to times we had, but'd see no more  
The pictures of the past would haunt us still, and there remains  
  
Oh I remember death in the afternoon

I found the bones of all your ghosts  
Locked in the wishing well  
While bird song gourmets dragged empty nets  
I slumbered in my shell  
In mitternacht, die mensch-maschine  
Kissed me on my eyes  
I rose and left the fire-ladies  
Glowing lonely in the night  
With all the pornographers  
Burning torches beneath the sea  
  
[Chorus:]  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
I want to be a machine  
  
I stole a cathode face from newscasts  
And a crumbling fugue of songs  
From the reservoir of video souls  
In the lakes beneath my tongue  
In flesh of ash and silent movies  
I walked at boulevards again  
A nebula of unfinished creatures  
From the lifetimes of my friends  
I hope your innocence has depraved me  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Broadcast me, scrambled clean  
Or free me from this flesh  
Let the armchair cannibals take their fill  
In every cell across wilderness  
We'll trip such a strangled tango  
We'll waltz a wonderland affair  
Let's run to meet the tide tomorrow  
Leave all emotion dying there  
In the star cold beyond all of your dreams  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ah!

Someone stood beside me for a moments in the rain  
A silhouette, a cigarette and a gesture of disdain  
I felt a dark door open, saw a sudden ghost come through  
A spark leap from my fingertip and I knew it must be you  
Ain't you the man who dies every day?  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
We never saw you walk in, we never saw you leave  
You flick the ashes off a lap on everybody's sleeve  
You always play that funny pack of cards without an ace  
And every street you ever walked is mapped out on your face  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  
You always kept a sunset behind your lonely shoulder  
You never showed on photographs and you never grew much older  
You flicker like a shaky shadow, moving like a thief  
You never drop your facade and you never seek relief  
'Cause you're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man who dies every day  
You're the man  

I thought you knew me by now  
Let the lights go on roaring  
Someone's hand on my shoulder  
Then whip past the turning point  
There's time for the taking  
  
[Chorus]  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
Maximum acceleration  
  
A face that goes slowly  
A signal close by me  
The landscapes are changing  
And some of us flipped a coin  
And shimmered away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You really were aching  
It's turning to twilight  
Moving over and under  
Then a couple of figures  
Shook their heads of the high lines  
  
[Chorus]

We were so young, we were too vain.  
Dance in the dark, sing in the rain.  
Time on our hands, hope in our hearts.  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon.  
  
We stood alone, silent and proud.  
Moments unknown, lost in a crowd.  
Running through memories like thieves in the night.  
Clutching emotions, holding too tight.  
Hold turns to dust, shattered by light.  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon  
  
We were talking, passing strangers.  
Moments caught across an empty room.  
Wasted whispers, faded secrets.  
Quickly passes, time goes, time goes by too soon

While a fat guy zips by, bony in a Zodiac  
Picking out trouble, maybe looking for a heart attack  
All-night boys in the Piccadilly arcade  
(???) trawling for some rough trade  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Can't you feel the time bomb ticking in your head?  
Too many memories are burning in your bed  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Dead in the dole queue, face like a statue  
Laugh like a maniac, walk like a king too  
Spiked hair, don't care, hot spam outlaw  
Rad man (?) rips it out, you're buzzing like a chainsaw  
(Chorus)  
High-rise reptile sucking on a cigarette  
Ripped suit, zip boots, dancing like an insect  
Tottenham Court Rolexes the excuses (?) in the wind hide  
The city's pretty dead but I'm still alive  
(Chorus)  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night  
Saturday night in the city of the dead  
Saturday night  
(Repeat and fade)  

My obsession  
Your desire  
Come let me lead you  
To the fire  
Show some mercy  
My pounding heart  
Can't take much more of this  
You've got play your part  
Bodies yearning  
Is this for real?  
Words cannot express the way I really feel  
Passion burning  
You ignite the flame  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll never be the same again  
Chorus:  
The closer I get to you  
The more I reveal is true  
And something inside of me  
Burns my reality  
Use your imagination  
Exorcise  
See your future  
Through my eyes  
No salvation  
Nowhere to hide  
We're one dimension  
We're one inside  
Is this perfection  
Taken to extreme?  
We're drowning in a sea of possibilities  
Pure emotion  
You can't conceal  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll know that this time it's for real  
(Chorus)  
Bodies yearning  
Is this for real?  
Words cannot express the way I really feel  
Passion burning  
You ignite the flame  
We touch, we come alive  
We'll never be the same again  
(Chorus)  
  
  

[Chorus:]  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
  
I'm a lonely hunter, a hungry ghost  
When you call a passion you must pay the host  
Look upon me as I thunder, I wonder if you wonder  
How it feels to be the lonely hunter  
  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
The wind blows clouds across my cheek  
My collar's up and my coat is sleek  
  
Look upon me as I blunder, I wonder if you wonder  
How it feels to be the lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
Lonely hunter  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]

[Chorus]  
Welcome to..  
Welcome to..  
Welcome to the song.  
  
Hear the words of the syncopated rhythms.  
Welcome to the song.  
And when it calls you, time to move on.  
We go!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feel the strength of a hundred thousand heartbeats,  
Cry welcome to the song.  
And as it lifts you, time to move on.  
We go!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Drawn from the inside,  
Time to move on.  
We go!  
We go!

The sound is on the visions move  
The image dance starts once again  
They shuffle with a bovine grace and glide in syncopation  
Just living lines from books we've read  
With atmospheres of days gone by  
With paper smiles  
The screenplay calls a message for the nation  
Chorus:  
And those who sneer will fade and die  
And those who laugh will surely fall  
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall  
The thin wall  
Thin wall  
Grey men who speak of victory  
Shed light upon their stolen life  
They drive by night and act as if they're moved by unheard music  
To step in time and play the part  
With velvet voices smooth and cold  
Their power games a game no more  
And long the chance to use it  
(Chorus)  
And those who dance will spin and turn  
And those who wait will wait no more  
And those talk will hear the word  
And those who sneer will fade and die  
And those who laugh will surely fall  
And those who know will always feel their backs against the thin wall  
The thin wall  
Thin wall  
The thin wall (Repeat 3 times)  
And those who dance  
The thin wall  
And those who talk  
The thin wall  
And those who sneer  
The thin wall  
And those who laugh  
The thin wall  
And those who know  
The thin wall  
And those who dance  
The thin wall  
And those who wait  
The thin wall  
And those who talk  
(Fade)  

Walked in the cold air  
Freezing breath on a window pane  
Lying and waiting  
A man in the dark in a picture frame  
So mystic and soulful  
A voice reaching out in a piercing cry  
It stays with you until  
  
The feeling has gone only you and I  
It means nothing to me  
This means nothing to me  
Oh, Vienna  
  
The music is weaving  
Haunting notes, pizzicato strings  
The rhythm is calling  
Alone in the night as the daylight brings  
A cool empty silence  
The warmth of your hand and a cold grey sky  
It fades to the distance  
  
The image has gone only you and I  
It means nothing to me  
This means nothing to me  
Oh, Vienna  
  
This means nothing to me  
This means nothing to me  
Oh, Vienna
