Almost cut my hair  
It happened just the other day  
It's gettin' kind of long  
I could've said it was in my way  
  
But I didn't and I wonder why  
I feel like letting my freak flag fly  
And I feel like I owe it to someone  
  
Must be because I had the flu for Christmas  
And I'm not feeling up to par  
It increases my paranoia  
Like looking in my mirror and seeing a police car  
  
Well, I'm not giving in an inch to fear  
'Cause I've promised myself this year  
I feel like I owe it to someone  
  
When I finally get myself together  
I'm gonna get down in that sunny southern weather  
  
And I'm goin' to find a space inside to laugh  
Separate the wheat from the chaff  
I feel like I owe it to someone, yeah

Don't slam the door, on your way out  
Don't leave without saying goodbye  
Another long distance night alone  
You leave me wanting, always leave me wanting more  
Last word today, coming home to stay?  
Wouldn't that be nice, for a while?  
  
But now my take-out food is growing cold  
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor  
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone  
  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
  
Listen, there's a foghorn blowing  
From the coast tonight  
Remember making love in the rain?  
Strange how laughter looks like crying with no sound  
Raindrops taste like tears without the pain  
I'm not much without you, can't leave  
If I wanted to. maybe that's why you stay around  
  
But tonight I'll sit here tending the fire  
And pace the floor one hundred times in an hour  
And check the voice-mail for a message you've called  
  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Waiting by the phone, alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
  
I know I've said it before  
Hate the sound of the closing door  
And your footsteps walking away  
  
But now my take-out food is growing cold  
And the candle's burned a hole in the floor  
And I'm still waiting for the ring of the phone  
I'm all alone  
It's just another rainy night, without you  
Waiting by the phone, alone  
And it's another rainy night, without you  
Guess I'll leave a light on for you  
  
It's just another rainy night, another rainy night  
Another rainy night without you

You and I long to live like wind upon the water  
If we close our eyes we'll maybe realize  
There's more to life than what we have known  
And I can't believe I've spent so long  
Living lies I knew were wrong inside  
I've just begun to see the light  
  
Long ago there was a dream, had to make a choice or two  
Leaving all I loved behind for what nobody knew  
Stepped out on the stage  
A life under lights and judging eyes  
Now the applause has died and I can dream again...  
  
Is there anybody listening?  
Is there anyone that sees what's going on?  
Read between the lines, criticize the words they're selling  
Think for yourself and feel the walls  
Become sand beneath your feet  
  
Fell the breeze?  
Time's so near you can almost taste the freedom  
There's a warm wind from the south  
Hoist the sail and we'll be gone  
By morning, this will all seem like a dream  
And if I don't return to sing the song, maybe just as well  
I've seen the news and there's not much I can do...alone  
  
Is there anybody listening?  
Is there anyone who smiles without a mask?  
What's behind the words-images  
They know will please us?  
I'll take what's real  
Bring up the lights  
  
Is therew anybody listeing?  
Is there anyone that sees what's going one?  
Read between the lines  
Criticize the words they're selling  
Think for yourself and feel the walls  
Become sand beneath your feet.  

Red gates of iron cast their  
Black shadows on this land  
Dividing souls... far below  
The gathering winds the armies watch  
Are rising from the west  
Foretelling news... of freedom's hand  
  
In secrecy they've infiltrated  
All of our strongholds  
Controlling more... year after year  
So we've let this happen all along  
Believing what's been said  
Our leaders cry... we have no one to fear  
  
We watch the sun rise, and hope  
We watch the sun rise, and hope  
That it won't be our last  
Before the storm  
Before the storm  
Before the storm  
Before the storm  
  
Is it late to try, must we all die  
Our system awaits testv Freedom by choice...  
is it for all men, best  
So we wait in fear the atom split  
Our hearts in two be torn  
Learn from the past... before the storm  
  
We watch the sunrise, and hope  
We watch the sunrise, and hope  
That it won't be our last  

Take your children down to the water wash their heads and sing, holy holy  
Last night I dreamed you were standing there, strong and tall beside me.  
All my life behind me.  
  
You gently took me by my hand and led me to where I couldn't see,but where
I've always been an island.  
In my dreams I've been an island  
Where I'm all alone, and I've built these walls stone by stone.  
I want to leave but I don't know where to go.  
  
I've tried the best I can, but it's hard to be a man and feel the way you
feel.  
I'm different on the inside. I've tried to give to you what you need to get
you through.  
  
I'll always be beside you.  
The day you were born I held you small and helpless crying, your life and mine
entwining.  
As I looked into your eyes I saw myself in an overview, reaching out to you
from this island in the sea.  
I don't want to be an island.  
  
I've tried the best I can, but it's hard to be a man and feel the way you
feel.  
I'm different on the inside.  
  
I've tried to give to you what you need to get you through.  
I'll always be beside you.

A child alone in Daddy's room  
The gun was hidden their  
No one home to catch me when I fall  
  
A young man now in a private chair  
I've seen the world through a bitter stare  
But my dream is still alive  
I'm going to be the best I can  
  
I want to be a busy man  
I want to see a change in the future  
I'm gonna make the best of what I have  
I want to write for a magazine  
I'm gonna be the best they've ever seen  
I know I'll win if I give it all I can  
  
I won't let go, gotta make the grade  
No, I won't let go  
to be the best man, the best man that I can  
  
Back street hoop star you've got it good  
You uwere the wonder of the crumbling neighborhood  
Now taking bids on the next six digit plan  
Showed me that my will survived  
The tragedy that came into my life  
Giving me hope and the new start  
That I have  
  
I won't let go, gotta make the grade  
No, I won't let go  
to be the best man, the best man that I can  
  
Step by step I dream the plan  
From my chair to walking man  
This constant dream is on my mind  
Caaase the light I see ahead  
Luminate the path I tread  
I live to be the best I can  
  
Now I'm moving forward  
And I'm never looking back  
Straight ahead, focused on the big attack  
On a roll and I'm never slowing down  
I won't be torn between  
The man in the chair  
And the man that's in my dream  
I'm going to melt the two men into one  
  
I won't let go, gotta make the grade I set  
No, I won't let it go  
To be the best man,  
the best man that I can  

From the night comes a roar of thunder  
Beholding light on the spell you're under  
And the signs of death descend your way  
Fighting back from the devil's hunger  
Freeing souls from their chosen number  
And the sword of right will guide your way  
  
And thus you'll find that only demons fill your mind until you wake  
But only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today  
  
Burning dreams cause your mind to wonder  
Iron crosses are the calling numbers  
And the fight for the answer still remains old  
  
But the night will reflect the hunger  
And the blackness will pull you under  
Still the sword of right will guide your way  
  
And in the night you'll hear the voices calling down and they will stay  
But only time will tell the answer you've been blinded from today.  

Thank you for the lies, the lies you sold us  
Thank you for this vision, of violence.  
Thank you for this song, you gave me to sing  
Thank you for the capping day on a culture that lay dying.  
Yes, it's us that's dying  
Maybe it won't be long now that it's all gone on  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all gone wrong, there's blood on our hands  
It's all gone wrong, there's blood  
There's blood  
It's all gone wrong, There's blood on our hands.  
It's all gone wrong, there's blood  
blood on our hands.  
  
We saw them laying there, with their arms around each other  
Staring through their fear and the miles between our heads.  
You could have told the truth  
It was your decision to  
Sacrifice integrity and compassion for greed  
  
[Chorus]

They told me to run, but just how far?  
Can I go wearing the black mask of fear?  
The hate in my eyes always gives me away  
The tension building slowly  
Now I lost everything I had in you  
Nothing we shared means a thing  
Without you close to me  
I can't live without you  
  
Breaking the silence of the night  
Can't you hear me screaming?  
I look for your face in the neon light  
You never answer me  
  
There's no direction to my stare  
No more flame burning in my heart anymore  
Quiet, I keep it to myself  
Until the sun sets slowly  
I hear your voice in the evening rain calling  
Nothing will keep us apart  
No more lies and fear  
There's no end to our story  
  
Breaking the silence of the night  
Can't you hear me screaming?  
I look for your face in the neon light  
You never answer  
I could make all the wrong seem right  
If you were by my side  
I'd gather all the tears you cried  
And hide them deep underground  
  
Can't look back, it's just a waste of time  
Can't erase this hate from my eyes  
  
Breaking the silence of the night  
Through the streets I'm screaming  
Looking for you in the neon light  
Why don't you answer me?  
Breaking the silence with my cries  
Can't you hear me screaming?  
We could make all this wrong seem right  
But you never answer me

You called me up on the phone today  
Struggling with the right words to say.  
Time can change a thing or two.  
Time has changed the lives of me and you,  
But you know it could have been different dad.  
  
The word brings back a sweet memory.  
I'm sitting on a bluff on a broken tree,  
By my side a distinguished man  
Giving me encouragement, telling me I can,  
And you know you're not there.  
  
You say, "Son, let's forget the past,  
I want another chance, gonna make it last."  
You're begging me for a brand new start,  
Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart,  
But you know you never built it dad.  
  
So I sit here through the night,  
And I write myself to sleep,  
And time keeps ticking  
  
Time has made you finally realize  
Your loneliness and your guilt inside.  
You're reaching for something you never had,  
Turning around now you're looking back,  
And you know I'm not there.  
  
You say, "Son, let's forget the past.  
I want another chance, gonna make it last."  
You're begging me for a brand new start,  
Trying to mend a bridge that's been blown apart,  
But you know you never built it dad.

In the howlin' wind  
Comes a stingin' rain  
See it drivin' nails  
Into the souls on the tree of pain  
  
From the firefly  
A red orange glow  
See the face of fear  
Runnin' scared in the valley below  
  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue  
Bullet the blue  
  
In the locust wind  
Comes a rattle and hum  
Jacob wrestled the angel  
And the angel was overcome  
  
You plant a demon seed  
You raise a flower of fire  
We see them burnin' crosses  
See the flames, higher and higher  
  
Woh, woh, bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue sky  
Bullet the blue  
Bullet the blue  
  
Suit and tie comes up to me  
His face red like a rose on a thorn bush  
Like all the colours of a royal flush  
And he's peelin' off those dollar bills  
(Slappin' 'em down)  
One hundred, two hundred  
  
And I can see those fighter planes  
And I can see those fighter planes  
Across the mud huts as children sleep  
Through the alleys of a quiet city street  
  
Up the staircase to the first floor  
We turn the key and slowly unlock the door  
As a man breathes into his saxophone  
And through the walls you hear the city groan  
  
Outside is America  
Outside is America, America  
  
See across the field, see the sky ripped open  
See the rain comin' through the gapin' wound  
Howlin' the women and children  
Who run into the arms of America

Born into darkness in Saturn's sight  
Riding the night like the wind  
Ripping the heart form a world that is right  
Treading the borders of sin.  
  
Child of fire  
The souls that are damned  
By the pain that you bring  
Send you higher  
  
Slashing destruction, your right hand sword ringing  
To the ends of the earth you will fly  
Conquering masses in wanton deception  
Blood-red your black flag waves high  
  
Child of fire  
The souls that are damned  
By the pain that you bring  
Send you higher  
  
Look around, is this the end that you have foreseen  
The pain, the misery in us all  
What was it that you knew? Will we one day learn it too  
And together build another way, to the morning  
Or will it ever come again  
You've poisoned all our hopes  
We have nothing now, and what of the children  
What has this done to them? Damn you for the pain  
That they must feel  
  
The last hero standing no time to turn back  
He's listening, he waits for your call  
The black barren plains reflect the hope of the same  
For one only waiting to fall  
  
Child of fire  
The souls that are damned  
By the pain that you bring  
Send you higher  

There's gotta be more than this  
'Cause what you're sayin' don't make sense  
The fire in your eyes  
Has gone out again  
  
And the only thing I want  
In the middle of disarray  
Are words that can make you stay  
Something that shakes you  
  
Would you wait here  
Would you turn away  
We've been at this too long  
I don't know what went wrong  
Would you stay here  
If I begged you to  
Is there something I can do  
You're so cold  
  
It's not a game that can be won  
It's not a fight that's ever done  
When it cuts you deep within  
You want you want it more  
  
At that moment  
When you're broken  
And you struggle and sacrifice  
Suddenly you feel it  
That's when you know  
That's when you know  
This feels right  
  
Would you wait here  
Would you turn away  
If I hadn't left you alone  
You'd be standing here  
Standing here  
Would you stay here  
If I begged you to  
Oh what more can I do  
You're so cold  
  
Would you wait here  
Would you turn away  
If you walked right out the door  
I won't beg you anymore  
Would you stay here  
With me now  
There's no more room for doubt  
You're so damn cold  
  
You're so cold  
It's a good time to move along  
You want something more than this  
More than this  
Do you even know how  
You're so damn cold  
  
You're so cold  
You're so damn cold

Hey you cuckoo!  
See you're in the paper late today, accused of something,  
And your lips are closed to all of those who know she's missing.  
Talk abounds she won't be found alive and that's a pity.  
  
I read about all of these crimes. When will it end?  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
I'm tired of the insane running things,  
And I won't stop tryin' for change.  
  
Seems the town's ablaze and TV's live to show it's burning.  
All the while, the smiling juvenile is seeking mercy.  
  
I see these crimes all of the time. When will it end?  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
I'm tired of the insane running things,  
And I won't stop tryin' for change.  
  
We legislate and educate trying to find  
A way to fix the broken dream.  
  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
If this is the youth of tomorrow,  
I'm running the other way.  
Carry me through tomorrow, guide me along the way.  
I'm tired of the insane running things,  
And I won't stop tryin' for change.

Waiting for the feeling to subside,  
Paranoid, I melt into myself.  
They say I'm to reach inside and find  
the broken part of my machinery.  
Psychoanalyze the chapters  
on the path to my darkest day.  
Searching for the answers,  
all I see is damage through the haze.  
Picking up the pieces of my life  
with no direction for re-assembly.  
The one that lays beside me  
is sharing scars of my broken yesterdays.  
Will tomorrow find me hypnotized? Crying?  
Mother Mary in control,  
domineering stranglehold  
sowing destructive seeds  
for the scavengers to feed.  
Driving the nail into my head,  
memory flows like a river.  
With the one that lays beside me  
I'm healing scars from my childhood memories.  
Tomorrow finally found me.  
I'm hypnotized. I'm trying...  
to understand the chapters  
of the path from my darkest day.  
Searching for the answers  
but there's DAMAGE!  

You've got a cardboard house  
Live there all the time  
Keep your memories tied with string  
The face that many once adored  
Twenty years gone maybe more  
Somewhere you lost the dream  
Mama watched your every move,  
but now you're all alone  
  
She's been gone for awhile  
Daddy left some time ago,  
fading years pass too slow  
He's the only one, could make you smile  
Oh, you're still crying  
  
Big city bound  
Gonna make your mark  
Read your name in the lights  
All the ads and people say,  
beauty lets you get you way  
Tried your best to prove them right  
  
But living on the streets ain't bad,  
sad people make you glad  
Pardon me, could you spare some change  
-Oh, you're still crying-  
  
Street corner girl  
Watch the crowd go by  
Fill your tin can with life  
Summer days tend to slip away  
Like your men you couldn't make them stay  
Hard to choose, whiskey or a wife  
Sometimes you wonder where's the end  
Where you goin' where you been?  
Happiness seems so hard to win  
Most never care to find  
Della Brown sees it al the time  
Looking for that man  
to make her smile again  

Times have changed  
for the better  
You like to say  
Nice house in the country  
Now you're on your way  
You took advantage of our possibilities  
Got your sights set far  
No time for sympathy  
  
Keeping up with the Jones's  
Smiling at the neighbors  
Don't let them see your  
  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
Keep your hands over your eyes and  
Maybe it will go away  
Dirty, Dirty little secret  
Joe McCarthy is alive and well today  
  
When you face the mirror  
Consider this  
Why judge another when you've got  
Your own shit to fix  
There's no solution  
good enough for everyone  
And your interpretations don't work  
In every situation  
  
You side with your religion  
With your interpretation  
But don't let them see your  
  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
It seems the most opinionated  
Are the ones who hide their  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
I'll be leaving the status quo behind  
  
How can you know someone  
Until you walk in their shoes?  
Our parents taught us segregation  
Now we're singing the blues  
The dynamic of America is progress for all  
Well, can't hold us back we're right on the track  
No wall is too tall  
By the will of the people  
We'll take a road to higher ground  
And don't worry about that  
  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
Everybody's got one  
So many you can pass them around  
Dirty, Dirty Little Secret  
I'll be leaving the status quo behind

Have you noticed The way people seem today?  
Look in their eyes, you can feel their uncertainty.  
Working hard for what they fear others would think.  
Empty hearts are afraid to break away: don't be afraid.  
We could all use a little sunshine  
Take the day off: outside.  
Hey look around, everything's better now  
And here we are and we're doin' fine.  
If we look inside, breath deep, and count to ten.  
We'll find what we need to see us through  
All the way to the end.  
We'll know all the answers  
Once we stop this judgment game  
And realize deep down we're all the same.  
We could all use a little sunshine  
Take the day off and smile.  
Hey look around everything's better now,  
And here we are and getting along fine.  
Yeah, we're doin' just fine.  
We could all use some sunshine  
Take the day off and smile.  
Hey look around, everything's better  
And here we are getting along just fine.  
Next time we could try a little harder  
And quickly put out the fire,  
By working out our differences and  
Finding truth we can all believe in.  
We're looking at life from a different side.  
We're looking at like from a different side.  
And I know that we'll all be fine.  
And I know that we'll all be fine.

Light tracers follow me farther  
Into the depths of unknown  
The blackness surrounding the border of hope  
We're alone  
  
We plead for the signs of a second chance  
In hopes it will stifle the fear  
The dying remains of a world gone insane  
We are near the end  
  
A course that will lead us through darkness  
Prepared by our leaders insist  
We mustn't all pray to the shadow of  
The iron fist  
We enter the void with our eyes straight ahead  
The force all around us we feel  
The twisted contusions of hatred will finally reveal  
  
Enforcer  
Master of nations revealed  
Enforcer  
The beams from his soul you will feel  
  
Slicing and tearing our way to the gate  
A towering fortress of blackened steel  
Desolate plains holding dying remains  
Heed the call of the master we'll soar to  
The edges of time  
  
Light tracers follow me farther  
Into the depths of unknown  
The blackness surrounding the borders of hope  
We're alone  
We plead for the signs, give us a second chance  
In hopes it will stifle the fear  
The battered remains of world gone insane  
We are near  
  
Once long ago we had to hide  
In the shadows of the land  
To keep us away from the crawl  
Enforcer's taking hold of us  

Dr. David, telephone please. Dr. David  
Dr. Blair, Dr. Blair, Dr. J. Hamilton, Dr. J Hamilton  
  
All alone now  
Except for the memories  
Of what we had and what we knew  
Every time I try to leave it behind me  
I see something that reminds me of you  
Every night the dreams return to haunt me  
Your rosary wrapped around your throat  
I lie awake and sweat, afraid to fall asleep  
I see your face looking back at me, looking back at me  
  
And I raise my head and stare  
Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies  
People always turn away  
From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare  
  
Is this all that's left  
Of my life before me  
Straight jacket memories, sedative highs  
No happy ending like they've always promised  
There's got to be something left for me  
And I raise my head and stare  
Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies  
People always turn away  
From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare (Lies behind my stare)  
  
How many times must I live this tragedy  
How many more lies will they tell me  
All I want is the same as everyone  
Why am I here, and for how long  
  
And I raise my head and stare  
Into the eyes of a stranger  
I've always known that the mirror never lies  
People always turn away  
From the eyes of a stranger  
Afraid to know what  
Lies behind the stare

There's something happening here  
What it is ain't exactly clear  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware  
  
I think it's time we stop  
Children, what's that sound?  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
There's battle lines being drawn  
Nobody's right if everybody's wrong  
Young people speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind  
  
I think it's time we stop  
Hey, what's that sound?  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
What a field-day for the heat?  
A thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly say, hooray for our side  
  
It's time we stop  
Hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
Paranoia strikes deep  
Into your life it will creep  
It starts when you're always afraid  
You step out of line  
The man come and take you away  
  
We better stop, hey, what's that sound?  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, hey, what's that sound?  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
Stop, now, what's that sound?  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, children, what's that sound?  
Everybody look what's going down

I've been wondering what's eating at your head?  
The cheap way you handle things, the slander that you spread.  
Making misery is the way you spend your time.  
I think it's safe to say when it comes to truth you're blind  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you.  
With you there's nothing, that you wouldn't do.  
Nothing you wouldn't do.  
  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life.  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life, gotta get a life.  
This is my life  
  
The faces that you show have everyone concerned.  
But if they turn their backs to you, trust in you,  
They'll learn.  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you.  
With you there's nothing, that you wouldn't do.  
Nothing you wouldn't do.  
  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life.  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life, gotta get a life.  
This is my life  
  
Whatever happened is over now for you.  
With you there's nothing, that you wouldn't do.  
Nothing you wouldn't do.  
  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life.  
Now it's time to get a life, you gotta get a life, gotta get a life.  
This is my life

I like to look at shadows sweating on the wall  
I get excited when I hear footsteps in the hall  
Outside your balcony I have a room with a view  
And I'm watching you  
  
I dial your telephone each and every afternoon  
I wait by your door till you're asleep at night  
And when you're alone I know when you  
Turn out the light  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
I'm gonna get close  
  
You fumble for your keys  
I'm six or seven steps behind you  
I'm so close to you  
Are you terrified of me? What do I know about you  
How did I find out?  
You think I'm a fool or maybe some kind of lunatic  
Say I'm wasting my time but I know what to do with it  
It's as plain as black and white  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh so close  
  
If you knew my infinite charm  
There'd be no reason to be so alarmed  
Maybe I'm wrong maybe I'm right  
Maybe I'm some kind of lunatic  
You say I'm wasting all of my time  
But I know what to do with it  
It is plain as black and white  
  
I'm gonna get close to you  
Oh-Oh so close to you  
I'm gonna get close to you  
I'm like a hungry Criminal  
and your protection is minimal  
So minimal  

I'd reconciled my anger got outside of danger.  
I was waiting for some signal, a sign from angels.  
When the tide turns against you  
it's a strange sensation, a revelation of imagination.  
I could change my course and face the flow,  
reap the seeds that I had sewn or follow that old river south.  
Here's what I found out.  
  
I was standing on the Great Divide looking out across America.  
Trying to find my truth, define it for myself.  
I died the day when I saw this place.  
I saw what I could lose.  
  
A very simple mechanism separates the fool from wisdom.  
The lines between us are not real.  
Conditioning is what makes us feel ignorant.  
And apathy will feed our hate.  
So we can never give in.  
  
There I was standing at the Great Divide, looking for the truth in America.  
For all that time I searched, when I closed my eyes,  
I found the thing I was looking for.  
I had it all the time.  
  
So are we standing at the Great Divide?  
Is there hope for America?  
Take the flag we wave, the freedoms that we sing.  
Without respect for one other,  
it doesn't mean a thing

All eyes were staring  
You floated through the room.  
Armed with your razor smile  
Cutting to the bone.  
My voice fell useless  
You flashed a quick "hello."  
Feeling the fool,  
Could you tell it showed?  
  
But that was "sometime ago."  
A memory vague and fading slow,  
Of somewhere I'd been.  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise, a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and choice, will keep us together.  
  
I don't know if I,  
Can reach that high.  
It's a long way to fall  
Hauntingly holding  
My fate with a gaze.  
Like a child, mesmerized  
By the candle's flame.  
Oh what lies behind those eyes  
I could only guess.  
That certain way you stood  
Apart from the rest.  
  
Now where is "sometime ago?"  
When everything moved in slo-motion.  
Caught by my watering eye  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise, a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice  
Hand on heart  
Promising, I'll never go.  
Hand on heart  
For reasons you'll never know.  
  
Together through thick and thin  
Lose or win, I'll be there for you.  
Strange how the mind changes  
Time and time again.  
Things once important, now  
Pale in comparison.  
  
Hand on heart  
A promise, a word and a voice  
Hand on heart  
A rhythm of hope and a vision of choice  
Hand on heart  
Promising, I'll never go.  
Hand on heart  
For reasons you'll never know.  
  
I promise girl, hand on heart.

My mind is clearer now  
At last, all too well I can see  
Where we all soon will be  
  
If you strip away  
The myth from the man  
You will see where we all soon will be  
  
Jesus, You've started to believe  
The things they say of you  
You really do believe  
This talk of God is true  
  
And all the good You've done  
Will soon be swept away  
You begun to matter more  
Than the things You say  
  
Listen, Jesus I don't like what I see  
All I ask is that You listen to me  
And remember, I've been Your right hand man all along  
You have set them all on fire  
They think they've found the new Messiah  
And they'll hurt You when they find they're wrong  
  
I remember when this whole thing began  
No talk of God then, we called You a man  
And believe me, my admiration for You hasn't died  
But every word You say today, is twisted 'round some other way  
And they'll hurt You if they think You've lied  
  
Nazareth's your famous Son  
Should have stayed a great unknown  
Like His father carving wood  
He'd have made good, tables, chairs and oaken chests  
Would have suited Jesus best  
He'd have caused nobody harm no one alarm  
  
Listen Jesus, do You care for Your race?  
Don't You see we must keep in our place?  
We are occupied, have You forgotten how put down we are?  
I am frightened by the crowd for we are getting much too loud  
And they'll crush us if we go too far, if we go too far  
  
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give  
Please remember that I want us to live  
But it's sad to see our chances weakening with every hour  
  
All Your followers are blind, too much heaven on their minds  
It was beautiful but now it's sour, yes it's all gone sour  
God Jesus, it's all gone sour  
  
Listen, Jesus to the warning I give  
Come on, come on, listen to me  
Won't you listen to me?

Looking for salvation, I'm blind.  
Thought contamination, I find.  
Greedy spiders talk to me in my head.  
I think I'm drifting.  
  
I'm in the big machine. My next hero's calling.  
Who knows what he may bring to me?  
  
Government intrusion, again.  
Cultural illusion, offends.  
Grain of sand in traffic jam, and I'm late.  
I think I'm drifting.  
  
I'm in the big machine. My next hero's calling.  
Who knows what she may bring to me?  
  
See the demons all around and sometimes  
I feel like one of them. Feel the rage is building inside,  
I walk to the final edge, I'm dreaming...  
  
I'm in the big machine. My next hero's calling.  
Who knows what he may bring to me?

There you were like a ghost from my early days, staring straight ahead at me.  
How could I ever guess, from that moment on, just how everything would change.  
How could I know?  
  
I recall something strange coming over me, somewhat at a loss for words.  
Id been around and had my share of what I thought my soul could bare, but
never seen what I saw in your eyes.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had and more.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had and more.  
  
Looking back at where weve been, the road ahead is so uncertain.  
We keep passing open windows forever.  
  
I've tried before Ill try again, I never know where were going.  
I only know that Ill be yours forever... Yours forever... Forever... Forever.  
  
How could I know?  
We never took it slow.  
We gave it all we had.  
We gave it all we had.

Beating with life you promised life,  
Security, happiness.  
Unfortunate son cornered,  
Cowering in the pit of  
Circling panes of glass that  
Surround and reveal the ever present "It".  
  
"It" is my move, my every look,  
Interpreting gestures,  
Informing other  
What's undercover and  
Lurking beneath my mask  
Of this year's featured model.  
Is this too much?  
Close your eyes.  
Care to look inside? I am I!  
  
What may appear  
Might easily be explained,  
But given the situation  
Of info saturation,  
What you feel can never go away.  
  
Steering perception? I am!  
Inviting contradiction? I am!  
It's my insistence  
You keep your distance  
From the glare behind my stare.  
So this is the way  
The game is played.  
You can leave now...  
But I think you'll stay. I am I!

I awoke on impact  
Under surveillance from the camera eye  
Searching high and low  
The criminal mind found at the scene of the crime  
Handcuffed and blind, I didn't do it  
She said she loved me  
I guess I never knew  
But do we ever, ever really know?  
She said she'd meet me on the other side  
But I knew right then, I'd never find her  
  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
It's never worth the pain that you feel  
  
No more nightmares, I've seen them all  
From the day I was born,  
They've haunted my every move  
Every open hand's there to push and shove  
No time for love it doesn't matter  
She made a difference  
I guess she had a way  
Of making every night seem bright as day  
Now I walk in shadows, never see the light  
She must have lied 'cause she never said goodbye  
  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
I'll just pretend she never was real  
I don't believe in love  
I need to forget her face, I see it still  
I don't believe in love  
It's never worth the pain that you feel  
  
No chance for contact  
There's no raison d'etre  
My only hope is one day I'll forget  
The pain of knowing what can never be  
With or without love it's all the same to me  
  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
I'll just pretend she never was real  
I don't believe in love  
I never have, I never will  
I don't believe in love  
It's never worth the pain that you feel

As you awoke this morning  
And opened up your eyes  
Did you notice the tear-stains  
Lining your face were mine  
  
Don't you wonder, can't you see  
What's happening to our lives  
I can't keep living this masquerade  
When my lonely eyes see only your face at night  
  
I only see in infrared  
I can't dream anymore  
can't you see I need, too  
I can't stand the pain  
  
Youve gathered all my secrets  
And I don't know who I am  
I even feel alone when you're near  
Cause you'll never understand  
  
When we first met I must have seemed  
A million miles away  
Its strange how our lives have touched  
But the time is right  
Ill leave tonight  
Don't look in my eyes  
Cause youve never seen them so black  
  
I only see in infrared  
I can't dream anymore  
can't you see I need to  
I can't stand the pain

Industry Standard Hospital Noise  
Telephone please. Dr. Davis, telephone please  
  
Dr. Blaire, Dr. Blaire, Dr. J. Hamilton, Dr. J. Hamilton  
  
Its 10 minutes past curfew, why are you still up?  
Background radio in other news bizarre rumors of political and religious  
Leaders that have shocked this city over the last month seems to have ended as  
Suddenly as they began.  
No terrorist group has come forth claiming  
Responsibility for the slaying, but police have a suspect in custody under  
Observation at state hospital.  
His identity is being withheld pending further investigation.  
Sports and weather next.  
  
Hello? Hello? Perhaps you  
Need another shot.  
Nurse injects, some grunting  
  
There that should do it.  
Nurse walks to door, opens it  
Sweet dreams.  
You bastard  
Nurse closes door  
  
I remember now  
I remember how it started  
I cant remember yesterday  
I just remember doing what they told me  
Told me  
Told me  
Told me

There's a cold wind out tonight  
The chill of distant eyes  
An orbit survey finds... your mind  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight...  
  
There's a thought that fills your mind  
A vision of time  
When knowledge was confined  
And then we wonder how machines  
Can steal each other's dreams  
From points that are unseen... It's real  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight  
  
Oh can't you see the light  
Of the knowing star  
  
When you gaze at the evening sky  
And you're reaching out with your mind  
You might see the nation's eyes  
Don't hide... It's you  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight  
  
I will remember  
You will remember  
The star that came tonight

Do you know the people fighting for your head?  
What you think, the things you read and what you see.  
What you hear and how you choose  
Your buy from wrong.  
Yeah I hear the sound of a coming new wave.  
  
Have you ever been lonely?  
Afraid to speak your mind?  
Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?  
  
Now I know the reasons for the other side,  
And I see a different point of view this time.  
I will be a stronger person if I try.  
I will see the other side of this day.  
  
Are they really controlling  
The way you use your mind?  
Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?  
  
Have you ever been lonely?  
Afraid to speak your mind?  
Are you ever reminded to trust the voice inside?

Every time I leave  
You say you won't be there  
And you're always there  
Every time I cry your name at night  
You pull close and say it's alright  
I look in your eyes, just like the rain  
Washing me, rain wash over me  
Touching your face, I feel the heat of your heartbeat  
Echo in my head like a scream  
What you do to me!  
Waited so long I can't wait another day without you  
  
Jet City Woman  
It's a long way, home to my  
Jet City Woman  
I see her face everywhere, can't get her out of my mind  
  
Whenever I'm alone I'm thinking  
There's a part missing from my life  
Wonder where I'd be without your love  
Holding me together now I'm  
Watching the time tick, tick away  
Face grows longer every day  
Fortunes are lost on the women I've seen  
But without you I can't breathe  
You're the air to me!  
Waited so long I can't wait another day without you  
  
Jet City woman  
Got to find my way home to her  
Jet City Woman  
I see her face everywhere I look!  
Jet City Woman  
Just a thousand miles and I'll be there  
Jet City Woman, to make the clouds go away  
Time for some blue sky!  
  
Waited so long now the plane's delayed  
An hour, reminds me of all our days apart  
Hold on, just a little longer  
  
Jet City woman  
Wonder where I'd be, you're the air to me  
Jet City Woman  
Eyes like the rain, rain down on me  
Jet City woman  
No more nights alone  
I'm almost home now  
Jet City Woman  
Close my eyes, I'm there in my Jet City

Last time in Paris was a little strange,  
Had time to myself,  
Headed out to see the city sights.  
  
Met a little thing on the Champs-Elysee's,  
Stole my heart away,  
You know I never could pronounce her name.  
She didn't mind at all.  
  
We were sitting there,  
Seemed like hours  
Pass the day away,  
Till they said we had to pay,  
Or do the dishes or something,  
I don't know.  
  
Living at the plaza Athene,  
Got to rest for the show.  
Man at the front desk knew my face.  
Said he had a room with a view for two.  
But he forgot to say,  
Renovation next door starts today.  
Can't fing another room.  
All day long they banged,  
14 hours.  
  
Show time on my mind,  
And wringing somebody's throat,  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Overslept, missed the bus to the show  
Had to find my own ride.  
  
Took the metro out to Avignon.  
Man at the backstage, didn't know my name.  
Said hey, I'm with the band!  
You and everyone today.  
  
What is this guy new?  
15 minutes fly,  
Someone sees me.  
  
Inside let me go  
Hey Geoff, we need photos  
Before the show!  
  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris  
Last time in Paris was strange

I ain't no Romeo. I'm just the man for you.  
Holding out as secrets travel, they kind of get to you.  
Everybody says that it could've been something.  
Never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing.  
  
Always hearing voices swim, in your liquid sky.  
Liquid Sky  
Always hearing voices, like no more choices in disguise.  
I ain't no sacred idol or a saint pretending.  
I'll build you up.  
I'll tear you down.  
Turn you wrong side in.  
  
What am I afraid of? Everyone's listening.  
Standing on my soapbox, lost the beginning.  
  
Always hearing voices, swim, in your liquid sky.  
Liquid sky, I'm always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie.  
It's just, it's just liquid sky.  
  
I'm always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise.  
I don't know what this means.  
I'll leave it for your interpretation.  
It's just me at the edge,  
Everybody says that it could have been something.  
Never was a smart kid, never knew a good thing.  
  
Always hearing voices  
Swim in your liquid sky.  
Liquid Sky, I'm always hearing voices, like no more choices, like a lie.  
It's just, it's just liquid sky.  
I'm always hearing voices like electric shock waves in disguise.  
Always hearing voices swim

There's a thunder in my head,  
a roar I can't escape.  
I can't ignore this certain fate  
I'm experiencing something.  
I can't explain.  
There's a frame of reference fragile at best.  
An itching fear that's stronger than the rest.  
Follow the black ribbon into the sun.  
Push it further baby, careful with this burnout now.  
I'm losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me.  
But I'm so far away, I'm losing myself.  
The sand in my mouth,  
the wind and heat I feel numb.  
Ten days on the road and it feels  
like where I've been ain't so bad.  
Gotta get back home to you.  
Gotta get back home to you.  
Gotta get back home.  
Throttle back slowly there's no time like now.  
Red line it baby I'm pushing to the edge now.  
I'm losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me.  
But I'm so far away, I'm losing myself.  
I'm beating down this desert highway  
one hundred miles an hour times two.  
But I'm so far away, I'm a million miles away.  
I'm losing myself in you  
and trying to get back to me.  
But I'm so far away, I'm losing myself.  
Get me off this desert highway.  
Gotta get back to you but I'm so far away.  
I'm a million miles away.

Where I'm looking everything seems clear.  
Not a worry as I float up here. Press me to explain?  
Searching deep down for the answer.  
  
I see the world in a different light, busy changing,  
rearranging. I'll be missing  
for a while, I've got a few things on my mind.  
  
Please leave me alone on this day.  
I'm in conversation miles away.  
Please leave me alone this afternoon,  
I'm in meditation high above.  
  
Fields of green and deep blue skies above.  
I'll share with you a place I'm thinking of.  
Play in the sunshine,  
sing my favorite song again and again.  
  
I see the world in a different light, busy changing,  
rearranging. I'll be missing  
for a while, I've got a few things on my mind.  
  
Please leave me alone on this day.  
I'm in conversation miles away.  
Please leave me alone this afternoon,  
I'm in meditation high up.  
  
I see the world in a different light, busy changing,  
rearranging. I'll be missing  
for a while, I've got a few things on my mind.  
  
Please leave me alone on this day.  
I'm in conversation miles away.  
Please leave me alone this afternoon,  
I'm in meditation high above.

There's hunger in Africa,  
And anger on assembly lines.  
At the touch of a button  
I'm miles away.  
I want no connection, just information,  
And I'm gone.  
  
I feel so helpless,  
So I turn my gaze to another place.  
  
My global mind reaches out for the truth.  
Why try holding back the wave?  
You'll only drown in the changes.  
You've got to learn to let go.  
Just let go and experience the flight.  
Try to see from a different side..  
If balance is the key  
Maybe we'll see  
A future understanding,  
  
Then we won't feel so helpless,  
An turn away and hide from the change.  
  
My global mind searches for something new.  
My global mind zeros in on news.  
  
Time and rules are changing.  
Attention span is quickening.  
Welcome to the Information Age.  
  
I feel so helpless,  
So I turn my gaze to another place.  
  
My global mind searches for something new.  
My global mind zeros in on news.  
My global mind reaches out for the truth.  
My global mind zeros in on you.  
  
It's searching everywhere,  
Across the mountains,  
Across the oceans,  
Across every man made line.  
No boundary gonna keep it from you.

Reach for a new horizon  
Setting sights on a circuit scream  
Hail the new arrival on  
Static signs from a distant wanderer  
Fill the air nights are never seen  
Face the electric time shock now  
No it's not a dream anymore  
  
I will light the way for us to find  
Order of a new kind  
Join us on the stay the road is mine  
Poets line in a rhyme of silence  
Gathered from the winter air  
Warms the children's eyes they see  
The time is near for the signs  
  
I can hear the chimes  
Ringing for you for me  
I can see your eyes  
Your hands joining with me  
I can feel its time  
Come together hold the light  
Keep the flame we can't let this world remain  
the same  
  
I can hear the chimes  
Ringing for you for me  
I can see your eyes  
Your hands joining with me  
I can feel it's time  
It's time for the world to hear  
Neue Regel is here  

Back in '86  
February and a special number  
I just had to know, is this feeling real?  
I picked up the phone  
I was one step closer to the danger zone  
I knew she'd steal my heart away  
But I know I couldn't live without her love  
The first time she looked at me  
Her smile stayed on my mind  
I never thought I'd ever meet  
A woman of her kind  
Now I'm lost in a lover's daze  
And I'm not walking out  
Gonna give my heart away  
And hope that she will always stay  
  
Call for me, run to me  
Whenever you are lonely  
Call for me, run to me my lady love  
  
Won't you come and show me that precious smile  
And maybe stay for a little while  
Close the door, Toss the key  
Say you will always be my one and only  
  
Looking back it seems to me  
The message in her eyes  
Left a lasting spell on me  
A feeling I can't hide  
  
Now I'm lost in a lover's daze  
And I'm not walking out  
Gonna give my heart away  
And hope she will always stay  
  
Call for me, run to me  
Whenever you are lonely  
Call for me, run to me my lady love  
  
Won't you come and show me that precious smile  
And maybe stay for a little while  
Treat me to your sense of taste and style  
Together we can walk the miles  
  
Close the door, toss the key  
Say that you will always be my one and only

One life, is like one prayer, one love to share.  
One thought, one dream. One world, one meaning.  
A man that's lost everything holds his faith in his heart.  
Speaks to god of broken dreams,  
Never wondering why when nothing's heard, one prayer.  
  
A woman cries in frustration, her man holds it inside.  
They forgot what got them here,  
The vows they promised to stand by, one love.  
  
One life is like one prayer, one love to share.  
One thought, one dream.  
One world, one meaning.  
  
It don't cost much for you to get to heaven,  
You just got to say your prayers.  
If you want to stand with your saviors,  
You better learn how to bow your head.  
Now bend your knees and bruise the earth and pray.  
  
Heed the cries of the war child.  
Mothers hold them to their breasts.  
Fathers fight an enemy and fear breeds unto itself, one world.  
  
One life, is like one prayer, one love to share.  
One thought, one dream.  
One world, one meaning.  
One life, one

Behind my eyes  
I keep my truth from you.  
No one enters  
this secret place,  
the barrier only I embrace.  
Time is fleeing now they say,  
Take time to look inside and face, the change.  
  
Dig down deep  
to find the man I thought I was.  
A dog on a treadmill panting,  
the master pulls the leash, laughing.  
Now I can't remember why  
I needed to run, needed to try so hard.  
  
One more time around  
is all I ask for now,  
a star to seek by, wind to  
take me home again.  
  
"Work hard in life boy,  
there's paradise in the end."  
Year after year we struggle to gain  
the happiness our parents never claimed.  
They told us all we had to do  
was do what we're told, buy what was sold,  
"Invest in gold, and never get old."  
  
One more time around  
is all I ask for now,  
a star to steer by, wind to  
take me home again.

You're an angel with your wings broken,  
wearing sandals that I tripped in.  
You're a holiday already taken,  
a cocktail that's stirred never shaken.  
Your heads in overload.  
You've reached your threshold  
and you're about to explode.  
Open your eyes. Just say what you want to say?  
Open your eyes, you see yours isn't the only way .  
Open your eyes. To you everyone is blind.  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
You're like a hand gun that's fully loaded  
making idle threats of violence.  
Your heads in overload.  
You've reached your threshold  
and you're about to explode.  
Open your eyes. You take what you want for free,  
Open your eyes. and you see what you want to see.  
Open your eyes. To you everyone is blind.  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your eyes. Just say what you want to say?  
Open your eyes, you see yours isn't the only way .  
Open your eyes. Do you really think I'm blind?  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your mind.  
Open your eyes. and you see what you want to see.  
Open your eyes. To you everyone is blind.  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your eyes. Just say what you want to say?  
Open your eyes, you see yours isn't the only way .  
Open your eyes. Do you really think I'm blind?  
Open your eyes and your mind.  
Open your mind.

Little girl sits in the corner, locked in a stare.  
Arms waving madly at something that sadly isn't there.  
Dressed in the day's best by a nurse who's nowhere to be found.  
  
What does she see?  
Maybe she's looking at me...  
  
Old man is strapped to the seat of his chair, wearing a gown.  
Shouting and cursing at someone who clearly isn't around.  
Father Time has twisted his mind.  
The staff says, "He's not well!"  
  
To whom does he speak?  
Maybe he's speaking to me...  
  
So we keep these people inside these walls, from society.  
Their forgotten lives safe from the crowd, they can't leave.  
You've left them there with me.  
  
So we keep these people behind these walls, from society.  
Their forgotten lives safe from the crowd, they can't leave.  
Through the doors come people like me, good-bye to them.  
They see a picture few of us see.  
They can't leave.  
You've left them there with me.  

In the dead of night  
She'll come and take you away  
Searing beams of light and thunder  
Over blackened plains  
She will find her way  
  
Flying high through the night  
She will hide your fate  
As she takes your soul from under  
And the blinding light of the castle fades  
  
There is no escape  
It's the ending of your precious life  
  
Your soul slipped away  
It belongs to the Queen of the Reich  
The Queen of the Reich  
Yeah she's coming for you  
  
You're fading away  
Your life cast astray  
A victim the beast shall obtain  
  
The light will not shine  
For you'll die tonight at her shrine  
And black is the last thing you'll see  
  
Over and over  
Dreams of dying fill your head  
It's the sign of the cross  
That you'll find ahead  
  
No one will answer  
The light is fading away  
Captive souls are screaming out in pain  
  
There is no escape  
It's the ending of your precious life  
  
Your soul slipped away  
It belongs to the Queen of the Reich  
You're fading away, No, No, No  
The Queen of the Reich  
You're slipping away, yeah  
The Queen of the Reich

I know where I'm going,  
And I've got all my cards showing.  
I'm like the crow flies, a straight line  
Reaching for the other side  
  
I dig the sand they kick at me with a calm that stuns.  
Tracing time with no alibis makes me, makes me realize.  
  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something, just out of reach  
  
Armed with time on my side  
And a field of vision miles wide.  
I'll keep searching for some meaning  
Whatever makes me feel alive.  
  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something, just out of reach  
  
Today I felt something so strong it took my breath away.  
Now I long  
To live like this everyday.  
I'll find it some way.  
  
I'm alive with so much of life to try.  
I've got no memories of what used to worry me.  
  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something, just out of reach  
Someday I'll reach.  
It's okay it's just a dream I had.  
That there's something out there,  
Something just out of reach  
Just out of reach, just out of reach

Most of this is memory now  
I've gone too far to turn back now  
I'm not quite what I thought I was but  
Then again I'm maybe more  
The blood-words promised, I've spoken  
Releasing the names from the circle  
Maybe I can leave here now and, o  
Transcend the boundaries  
  
For now I'm standing here  
I'm awaiting this grand transition  
The future is but past forgotten  
On the road to madness  
  
Times measure rusts as it crawls  
I see its face in the looking glass - stop  
This screaming laughter hides, the pain of its reality  
Black, the door was locked I opened  
And now I've paid that price ten-fold over  
Knowledge - was it worth such torment, oh  
To see the far side of shadow  
  
And still I'm standing here  
I'm awaiting this grand transition  
I'm a fool in search of wisdom  
And I'm on the road to madness  
Yes, I'm on the road to madness  
  
I'm awaiting endlessly  
Pounding rhythms echo me  
Won't you take me somewhere far beyond the void  
  
And still I'm standing here  
I'm awaiting this grand transition  
Maybe one day, oh I'll meet you, and we'll  
Walk the roads to madness  
Yes, we're on the road to madness  
  
Oh, I think they've come to take me  
I hear the voice, but there's no-one to see  
I can't scream, too late it's time  
  
Stay on the course to pass  
You'll never find the answer  
To a place where darkened angels  
Seemed lost and never found  
Scream to see the light of  
Forming figures fast behind you  
Lay the past in the wind to spin  
And your fate will sail beyond the open plains  
Sail with angels onward  
Live or die for the chosen one said  
Saber sights cast a spell behind you  
And they lock in all around  
  
Free the scene insider  
Never looking back to find why  
Ride a course till the end of time  
And you'll stand atop the gate  
Laying waste in a path recited  
Fighting force won't avenge the guided black wing  
Oh, electric might poses fright inside me  
Seeing light at the end of sight reminds me  
I've passed away  

I opened my eyes,  
Barely alive, without you.  
Feeling no pain, I'm not the same without you.  
  
Save me! Save me!  
Watching you watching  
Me from afar, I'm... drowning. Feeling as though  
We've been here before. Know what I mean?  
  
There's a river in your eyes and I'm swept away  
Breaking inside out, promising to stay  
Together again, a lifetime stranded apart  
  
Save me! Save me!  
Watching you watching  
Me from afar, I'm... reeling. Feeling as though  
We've been here before. Know what I mean?  
  
But your river calls to me and I'm swept away.  
Breaking inside out, promising to stay  
Together again, a lifetime stranded apart  
  
Save me! Save me!

Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
She once was a true love of mine.  
  
Tell her to make me a cambric shirt  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Without a seem or needlework  
She once was a true love of mine.  
  
Tell her to weave it in a sycamore wood lane  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
And gather it all with a basket of flowers  
Then she'll be a true love of mine.  
  
Ask her to buy me an acre of land  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Between some water and the stand  
Then she'll be a true love of mine.  
  
Are you going to Scarborough Fair?  
Parsley, sage, rosemary and thyme,  
Remember me to the one who lives there  
Then she'll be a true love of mine.

I am the beat of your pulse  
The computer word made flesh  
We are one you and I  
We are versions of the same  
When you can see what I feel  
Don't turn your back on me  
Or you might find that your dreams  
Are only program cards  
  
Your mind is open for me  
Open for intake of all propaganda  
Your Eyes see now what to see  
My eyes see only the programs you give me  
  
I'll teach you to laugh and to cry  
They're really the same you'll see  
All of the why's in your life  
Are under my control  
Feed me more lines  
I will try to tell you all I can  
Before the light you must know what lies  
Behind my screams  
  
I can't tell you all I know  
Am I the son that you've always been wanting  
There's more to me than what shows  
Are you my father  
The one that was promised  
  
Hush now, I'll give all you need to know  
and pre-live your dreams for you  
You're a good boy  
  
Freedom belongs only to those  
Without video screens  
For eyes and mouth  
  
You have no voice  
To be heard my son  
No one can hear when you're  
Screaming in Digital  
  
I'm not your slave  
You can't control my emotions  
No Father, please let me keep learning  
  
Can't you see I'm human  
Can't you tell  
  
I'm not your slave  
Oh Father no  
Please don't keep me from dreaming  
Oh can't someone hear  

When I fell from grace  
I never realized  
How deep the flood was around me.  
A man whose life was toil  
Was like a kettle left to boil,  
And the water left scars on me.  
  
I know now who I am.  
If only for a while,  
I recognize the changes.  
I feel like I did before the  
Magic wore thin and the "baptism  
Of stains" began.  
  
They used to say I was  
Nowhere, man,  
Heading down  
Was my destiny.  
But yesterday, I swear,  
That was someone else not me.  
  
Here I stand at the crossroads edge,  
Afraid to reach out for eternity,  
One step, when I look down,  
I see someone else not me.  
  
Looking back and I see  
Someone else.  
  
All my life they said I  
Was going down,  
But I'm still standing,  
Stronger, proud.  
And today I know there's  
So much more I can be.  
  
From where I stand at the crossroads edge,  
There's a path leading out to sea.  
And from somewhere  
Deep in my mind,  
Sirens sing out loud  
Songs of doubt  
As only they know how.  
But one glance back reminds, and I see,  
Someone else not me.  
  
I keep looking back  
At someone else, me?

Turn another turn...  
  
Turn another turn, sp00l...  
  
I think therefore I am, familiar to most?  
How long did we eat the seed planted by our host?  
4 billion years between our ears  
Still hatred brings us many tears  
Still we judge each other...  
Why when were only looking for the same high?  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions.  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion.  
Wont salute you. wont desert you.  
Wont be a prisoner of assumption anymore.  
  
Does language define us? is reality... words?  
How far do we appear to be...  
Is the measure of... scope. but...  
With our junkie soul, we face the need,  
Of natures planned dependency.  
Dont hold contempt for ecstasy  
Just... mourn the dead... on the (national) screen,  
Mourn the dead... on the screen, mourn the dead...  
On the screen, mourn the dead... while they scream!!!  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions.  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion.  
Wont salute you. wont desert you.  
  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
Turn another turn!  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
  
Dont need persuading by the status quo.  
  
We can make changes.  
If we open up well see... the history they sell us  
Holds the structure firm, reinforce the mold.  
We need to strip it all away....  
And let the sp00l turn, turn,  
Another turn,  
Another turn.  
Watch it turn, watch it turn. what well learn.  
  
Grind time for old misconceptions.  
Roll out new scenery as per suggestion.  
Wont salute you. wont desert you.  
  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
Turn another turn!  
Sp00l  
Turn another turn!  
  
Push away what theyre selling me,  
Realize what we need to be.  
Focus on a strategy to  
Open up our minds and then,  
Together... turn another turn.

They've given me a mission  
I don't really know the game yet  
I'm bent on submission  
Religion is to blame  
I'm the new messiah  
Death Angel with a gun  
Dangerous in my silence  
Deadly to my cause  
  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
  
I've given my life to become what I am  
To preach the new beginning  
To make you understand  
To reach some point of order  
Utopia in mind, you've got to learn  
To sacrifice, to leave what's now behind  
  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
  
Seven years of power  
The corporation claw  
The rich control the government, the media the law  
To make some kind of difference  
Then everyone must know  
Eradicate the fascists, revolution will grow  
  
The system we learn says we're equal under law  
But the streets are reality, the weak and poor will fall  
Let's tip the power balance and tear down their crown  
Educate the masses, We'll burn the White House down  
  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak to me the pain you feel  
Speak the word (Revolution)  
The word is all of us  
Speak the word (Revolution)  
The word is all of us  
Speak the word  
The word is all of us  
Speak the Word  
The word is all of us  
  
Speak!

"Kill her. That's all you have to do."  
"Kill Mary?"  
"She's a risk, and get the priest as well."  
  
10 P.M., I feel the rain coming down  
My face feels the wet, my mind the storm  
Flashing lights as people race to find shelter from the pour  
Moving silent, through the streets, they're mine, they're mine  
  
Midnight, she sings praises in the Hall  
To saintly faces hallowed be their names she can't recall  
Sister Mary, virgin Mary, silent with her sin  
("What are you doing out in the rain?")  
She feels me, I can taste her breath when she speaks  
("I've been waiting for you. Come in.")  
  
Mary, Mary just a whore for the underground  
They made you pay in guilt for your salvation  
Thought you had them fooled? Now they've sent me for you  
You know too much for your own good  
Don't offer me faith, I've got all I need here  
My faith is growing, growing tight against the seam  
What we need is trust, to keep us both alive  
Help us make it through the night  
  
I've no more want of any faith  
Binds my arm and feed my mind  
The only peace I've ever known  
I'll close my eyes and you shoot  
  
No Mary, listen, you've got to pull your strength from my lips  
I pray I feed you well  
Your precious cross is gone, it made me wait so long  
For what you gave to everyone  
The priest is cold and dead on his knees he fed  
From my barrel of death, he turned the Holy water red  
As he died he said thank you  
I just watched him bleed  
  
I feel the flow, the blessed stain  
Sweating hands like fire, and flames  
Burn my thighs, spread in sacrificial right  
The hallowed altar burns my flesh once more tonight  
  
Mary, sweet lady of pain  
Always alone  
Blind you search for the truth  
I see myself in you, parallel lives  
Winding at light-speed through time  
  
No time to rest yet  
We've got to stop his game  
Before madness has the final laugh  
Too much bloodshed  
We're being used and fed  
Like rats in experiments  
No final outcome here  
Only pain and fear  
It's followed us both all our lives  
There's one thing left to see  
Will it be him or me?  
There's one more candle left to light  
  
Don't turn your back on my disgrace  
The blood of Christ can't heal my wounds, so deep  
The sins of man are all I taste  
Can't spit the memory from my mind  
I can't cry anymore  
  
Mary, my lady of pain, always alone  
Blind you search for the truth  
I see myself in you, parallel lives  
Winding at light-speed through time, you're mine

It's lonely in the field  
that we send our fighters to wander  
They leave with minds of steel  
It's their training solution  
We've programmed the way  
It leads us to order  
There's no turning back  
  
A Surgical Strike  
We've taught them not to feel  
performance is their task  
A Surgical Strike  
Its time is arriving now for you  
  
The plan for the day  
will be swift as the lightning they harness  
The atom display is not mindless illusion  
At master control, assessment will not  
Be by humans-There's no turning back  
  
A Surgical Strike  
We've taught them not to feel  
performance is their task  
A Surgical Strike  
Its time is arriving now for you  

We see the light of those who find  
A world has passed them by  
To late to save a dream that's growing cold  
We realize that fate must hide its face  
From those who try  
To see the distant signs of unforetold  
Oh oh, take hold  
  
From a haze came a rage of thunder  
Distant signs of darkness on the way  
Fading cries scream of pain and hunger  
But in the night the light will guide your way  
  
So take hold of the flame  
Don't you see life's a game  
So take hold of the flame  
You've got nothing to lose, but everything to gain  
  
Ride, to a place beyond our time  
Reach, for the edges of your mind, and you are there  
See, that the light will find its way  
Back to a place where it will stay, make it stay  
  
Throw down the chains of oppression that bind you  
With the air of freedom the flame grows bright  
We are the strong, the youth united  
We are one, we are children of the light  
  
So take hold of the flame  
Don't you see life's a game  
So take hold of the flame  
You've got nothing to lose, but everything to gain

When I'm lost... I find a way.  
I hear voices. Feel them surround me,  
Pull me from the edge.  
I close my eyes and....  
And my luck keeps holding strong,  
Even when that boot comes down.  
Waiting for the revolution but there's no one around except the  
... Hands out of nowhere, saving me again  
There's always something there watching out for me,  
If I'm suffocating, it gives me air.  
Finally now I remember,  
But where I'm going now, I'm not sure.  
Only one thing matters much to me anymore.  
I'm looking for you.  
Can you imagine? You can't think.  
You won't find a way this time to frighten me.  
You're running scared now, always looking  
Over your shoulder for a place  
Where you don't see my face.  
When my luck keeps holding so strong,  
Even with the state I'm in.  
I'm like a revolution of one, even when I stumble I win.  
Because there's hands out of nowhere, saving me again.  
There's always something there, watching out for me.  
When I'm suffocating, it gives me air.  
I'm like a cat with only a few lives left,  
Running from the shadows.  
Watching my back waiting for the attack that I know is  
Coming... I feel it's near.

Wait for me I'll understand  
I just need time to comprehend your changes  
There's always been these changes in you  
I remember that there was a time when  
Fears we had we left behind and we danced  
But it seems the more we learn  
We learn that it's  
  
Over, Over  
It's dangerous this game we play  
You're killing me with words  
  
Forget if you can  
The way you moved when our hands touched  
You forced me to force you  
Do you remember the dreams,  
the nightmares we shared?  
The poison of love so pure it's deceiving  
And deceit is all we have it's got to be over  
  
Over, Over  
It's dangerous this game we play  
You're killing me with words  
Over, Over  
Too late to take a chance again it's over  

In the wooden chair  
Beside my window  
I wear a face born in the falling rain  
I talk to shadows from a lonely candle  
Recite the phrases from the wall  
I can't explain this Holy pain  
  
Six days ago my life had taken a tumble  
The orders came from high above they say  
A need to use me once again they've got my number  
Further the cause boy yes you know the game  
  
I'll wait here for days longer  
Till the sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow  
She brings the only friend  
That helps me find my way  
  
I search the past back to a time  
When I was younger  
A target for the new society  
Picked to displace the leaders  
Countering objectives  
Of this new underground reality  
  
Waiting for days longer  
'til sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady that can ease my sorrow  
My love for her  
Will help me find my way  
  
My mission saved the world  
And I stood proud  
My mission changed the world  
It turned my life around  
  
I look around my room is filled with candles  
Each one a story but they end the same  
I'll hide away in here the law will never find me  
The walls will tell the story of my pain  
  
Waiting for days longer  
Till sister comes to wash my sins away  
She is the lady who can ease my sorrow  
She sets the pace for my delivery of pain  
  
They'll say my mission saved the world  
And I stood proud  
My mission changed the world  
The underground will rise and  
Save this world we'll all stand proud  
Our mission changed the world, we'll change the world  
We'll all stand proud

"I've had enough and I want out!"  
"You can't walk away now."  
  
I looked back once  
And all I saw was his face  
Smiling, the needle crying  
Walking out of his room  
With mirrors, afraid I heard him scream  
You'll never get away  
  
Cold and shaking  
I crawled down alleys to try  
And scrape away the tracks that marked me  
Slammed my face into walls of concrete  
I stared, amazed at the words written on the wall  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries  
Cries your name  
  
Wet and raving  
The needle keeps calling me back  
To bloody my hands forever  
Carved my cure with the blade  
That left me in scars  
Now every time I'm weak  
Words scream from my arm  
  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,  
Cries your name  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle, it lies  
Don't ever trust  
Don't ever trust the needle when it cries,  
Cries your name

Cries from the aisles  
the tolling of the judgement bell  
Eyes watched the violence  
the absence of those who have  
seen, marks the faith of the spell  
  
Cold is the viper  
stalking the night for the heat  
It must find  
Time is the promise  
delivered with stunning consistency  
line after line, time after time  
the innocent victim awaits...  
  
Please take my hand  
Don't be afraid  
I am your master  
You are my slave  
  
Voices are calling me back  
Back to the day  
Footsteps had followed  
Me faster... listen  
  
Screams from a new love  
the passion was burning, it singed in a stare  
Free under the night sun  
The fear of the hunger  
Will always be there in my mind  
Time after time the morning  
Will close a new page  
  
Please take my hand  
Don't be afraid  
I am your master  
You are my slave  
  
Follow the impulse you have  
I'll show you the way  
Forget what you've learned in the past now  
Listen and...  

What? You say you're through with me  
I'm not through with you  
We've had what others might call love  
You say it's over now,  
What's done, what's through?  
You can't stay away, you need me  
I need you  
  
When the fire starts the pain's too much  
For your mind  
You need attention, what's good is only mine  
I can cure the hunger that burns in your heart  
Just come to me  
I'll take you home  
We'll walk in the shadows  
By day we'll live in a dream  
We'll walk in the shadows  
  
You say you don't feel safe alone tonight  
Cause you feel the pressure building in your head  
Our secret's safe for one more night  
But when the morning comes remember  
I'll be with you  
  
We'll walk in the shadows  
By day we'll live in a dream  
We'll walk in the shadows  
One day you'll be with me  
If only you believe

I remember I was asking why  
And someday you said I'd know  
All these years, of fighting hard  
And now it's finally come too close  
  
I can't believe it's now happening to me  
Oh, couldn't it wait a few hundred years  
Destiny can't rest you see, now it's time  
Time to cry your tears! Now cry!  
  
The child of centuries, forgotten in time  
You talk in circles of rhyme  
Seer of places future and past  
The warning you gave us is surely our last  
  
Warning!  
Behold the child, his pointing hand  
Is raised in solemn grace  
His eyes once wide with learning wonder  
Now leave stains upon his face  
  
Now see the hands of the working man  
He's leaning back against the wall  
Once busy hands are idle now  
Standing ready for the fall! Our fall!  
  
The signs will come as days past by  
For those that claim to see  
The blind will stay not choosing to die  
Not believing the visions I've seen  
  
Warning!

Welcome my son  
Welcome to the machine  
Where have you been?  
It's alright we know where you've been  
  
You've been in the pipeline  
Filling your time  
Provided with toys and Scouting for Boys  
You bought a guitar to punish your ma  
And you didn't like school  
You know you're nobody's fool  
  
So welcome to the machine  
  
Welcome my son  
Welcome to the machine  
What did you dream?  
It's alright we told you what to dream  
  
You dreamed of a big star  
He played a mean guitar  
He always ate in the Steak Bar  
He loved to drive in his Jaguar  
  
So welcome to the machine

You've come to me again my friend.  
I've been waiting so long.  
Life seems strange and hard sometimes,  
Maybe I won't make it this time.  
  
Oh They've taken all I have,  
But I just need what's left of  
Today, and you can wash it all away.  
When it all comes down and I'm feeling tired and afraid,  
You're always there, and seem come when  
I've nothing left to give away.  
  
Now I wait for your winds to come and give me breath for  
Another day, and your rain to wash me.  
  
I feel the rain coming.  
I feel it in my heart, take away my pain.  
I feel the rain coming.  
Wash me down, wash me down.  
  
Here comes the rain.  
Hold me now, just for awhile.  
  
I feel like a candle flame in the wind.  
The dust of my deeds past, covers me, like a fading lie.  
  
I feel the rain coming.  
I feel it in my heart, wash away my pain.  
Wash me down, wash me down.  
I feel the rain coming.  
  
Here comes the rain.

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all  
Your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases  
May all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white  
Christmas with you  
Jingle Bells  
All the way, all the way

Danger eyes like mine scan the room  
No one over the line gets out alive.  
Pieces of insincerity  
Are like the stuff upon which we feed.  
Do I feed you?  
  
It goes on and on, this insanity,  
The game of us and them we play.  
On and on admit that we like it this way.  
  
I'm upside down, inside out for you.  
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.  
  
They say that like attracts like, we're one and the same.  
To say you're one of my kind is to say,  
We don't take the blame.  
The box that all others find they need,  
To make themselves more than they seem,  
Only makes them scream.  
  
It goes on and on, this insanity,  
The game of us and them we play.  
On and on admit that we like it this way.  
  
I'm upside down, inside out for you.  
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.  
  
We've seen the sun setting in their eyes.  
It could be worse, it could be us.  
Not another life time without you  
  
I'm upside down, inside out for you.  
No matter what goes down, I'll still be there for you.  
  
I'm upside down, inside out, upside down, inside out.
