Gabriella  
I gotta say what's on my mind  
Something about us  
Doesn't seem right these days  
Life keeps getting in the way  
Whenever we try, somehow the plan  
Is always rearranged  
  
It's so hard to say  
But I've gotta do what's best for me  
You'll be ok...  
  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
  
Don't wanna leave it all behind  
But I get my hopes up  
And I watch them fall everytime  
Another colour turns to grey  
And it's just too hard to watch it all  
Slowly fade away  
I'm leaving today 'cause I've  
Gotta do what's best for me  
You'll be ok...  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
  
Troy  
What about us?  
What about everything we've been through?  
  
Gabriella  
What about trust?  
  
Troy  
You know I never wanted to hurt you  
  
Gabriella  
And what about me?  
  
Troy  
What am I supposed to do?  
  
Gabriella  
I gotta leave but I'll miss you  
  
Troy  
I'll miss you  
  
Gabriella  
So  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
  
Troy  
Why do you have to go?  
  
Gabriella  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
  
Troy:  
I'm trying to understand  
  
Gabriella  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
  
Troy  
I want you to stay  
  
Gabriella  
I wanna go my own way  
I've got to move on and be who I am  
  
Troy  
What about us?  
  
Gabriella  
I just don't belong here  
I hope you understand  
  
Troy  
I'm trying to understand  
  
Gabriella  
We might find our place in this  
World someday  
But at least for now  
I gotta go my own way  
I gotta go my own way  
I gotta go my own way

[Hook] Mmm, mmm, yeah  
  
I got a lot of things I have to do  
All these distractions, our future's coming soon  
We're being pulled in a hundred different directions  
But whatever happens I know I've got you  
  
You're on my mind, you're in my heart  
It doesn't matter where we are  
We'll be alright, even if we're miles apart  
  
All I wanna do is be with you, be with you  
There's nothing we can do  
I just wanna be with you, only you  
  
No matter where life takes us  
Nothing can break us apart  
You know it's true

It's sunny then raining, but it's alright

Through every up, through every down  
You know I'll always be around  
Through anything, you can count on me!

No matter where life takes us  
Nothing can break us apart  
You know it's true  
I just wanna be with you

The day the door is closed  
The echoes fill your soul  
They won't say which way to go  
Just trust your heart  
  
To find what you're here for  
Open another door  
But I'm not sure anymore  
It's just so hard  
  
The voices in my head  
Tell me they know best  
Got me on the edge  
They're pushin', pushin'  
They're pushin'  
  
I know they've got a plan  
But the ball's in my hands  
This time it's man-to-man  
I'm droppin', fightin' inside the  
  
Whole world's upside down  
It's spinning faster  
What do I do now without ya?  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I'm kickin' down the walls  
I gotta make 'em fall  
Just break through them all  
I'm pushin', crashin'  
I'm gonna fight to find myself  
Me and no one else  
Which way I get down  
Searchin', searchin'  
Can't find a  
  
Road that I should take  
I should, tomorrow left us  
It's like nothing works without you  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
Yeah, the clock's running down  
Hear the crowd gettin' loud  
I'm consumed by the sound  
Is it hurt? Is it love?  
Can the music ever be enough?  
Gotta work it out, work it out  
You can do it, you can do it  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream  
  
I don't know where to go  
What's the right team?  
I want my own thing  
I want my own thing  
  
I can't choose, so confused  
What's it all mean?  
I want my own dream  
So bad I'm gonna scream, oh, ahh!

Music should be undivided, united  
  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
This is serious  
Don't walk away  
We can't pretend it's not happening

Comes an equally important share of the risk  
We gotta take this  
  
We can't back down  
There's too much at stake  
This is serious  
Don't walk away  
We can't pretend it's not happening

It's funny when you find yourself  
Looking from the outside  
I'm standing here but all I want  
Is to be over there  
Why did I let myself believe  
Miracles could happen  
Cause now I have to pretend  
That I don't really care  
  
I thought you were my fairytale  
A dream when I'm not sleeping  
A wish upon a star  
That's coming true  
But everybody else could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
When there was me and you  
  
I swore I knew the melody  
That I heard you singing  
And when you smiled  
You made me feel  
Like I could sing along  
But then you went and changed the words  
Now my heart is empty  
I'm only left with used-to-be's  
Once upon a song  
  
Now I know your not a fairytale  
And dreams were meant for sleeping  
And wishes on a star  
Just don't come true  
Cause now even I could tell  
That I confused my feelings with the truth  
Cause I liked the view and  
When there was me and you  
  
I can't believe that  
I could be so blind  
It's like you were floating  
While I was falling  
And I didn't mind  
  
Cause I liked the view  
Thought you felt it too  
When there was me and you

Na na na na  
Na na na na yeah  
You are the music in me  
  
You know the words  
"Once Upon A Time"  
Make you listen?  
There's a reason  
When you dream there's a chance you'll find  
A little laughter  
Or happy ever after  
Your harmony to the melody  
It's echoing inside my head  
A single voice (Single voice)  
Above the noise
