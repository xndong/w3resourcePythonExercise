Engineer: Aren't you a little young to build a rollercoaster?  
Phineas: Yes, yes I am  
Eng.: Well, I must say that I'm really quite impressed!  
But all your permits are in order,  
Don't forget the bricks and mortar  
And if you need a power loader be my guest  
But if I'm pressed -  
I'd say you look a little young to drive a forklift...  
Phineas: Yes, yes I am  
Eng.: It's good to see a younger guy like you,  
Who's creative and ambitious  
A little bigger than his britches  
And who got a fresh, exciting point of view  
Yes, it's true  
That you seem a little young  
To do the things that you do,  
Even with all the moxie you've got,  
Yes, you seem a little green  
To be controlling this machinery...  
Phineas: Yeah, I get that a lot

Dr. Doofenshmirtz: Back in Gimmelschtump  
I always had to keep it real  
Cause when you grow up in Gimmelshtump  
Young Heinz: Your childhood is less than ideal!  
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: So I don't dwell on how I'll crawled my way out of the
gutter  
No I don't!  
When people ask me what I mean, I say  
D-D-D-Do I stutter!  
  
Dr. Doofenshmirtz: But I'm no longer a hater  
Cause I got an Inator  
And a over-complicated scheme  
I get a couple of checks  
Every month from my Ex  
So I can finance my coming regime!  
  
And though my past was a wreck  
I won't let it affect  
My aspirations to cause mass hysteria  
Cause I'm as sure as can be  
That it's my destiny  
To be the ruler of the Tri-State Area!

I can see the things you doing  
And you think that I'm naive  
But when I get the goods on you  
She'll finally believe  
  
She says it's all just drama  
But every bubble's got to pop  
She's gonna see just what your doing  
  
And then you're finally gonna have to stop!  
Don't think you're gonna win this time  
'Cause you better believe I'm gonna drop a dime  
On you  
  
I'll getcha! Yeah! I'll getcha ya!  
And when I do you're gonna be Busted!  
Busted!  
I don't wanna put the hurt on you  
But you better believe me when I tell you  
That I finally got the dirt on you  
  
You're busted! (busted!)  
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light  
This is how it's gonna be  
When she finds out that I was always right  
  
You're busted!  
  
There's a new cop on the beat  
And I'm bringing down the heat  
My eyes are wise to all your lies, cause you're not that discreet  
And I don't care what you've heard  
'Cause there's one six letter word  
It's gonna set me free  
(Gonna set me free)  
It starts with a b  
(Starts with a b)  
It goes B-U-S-T-E-D you are busted!  
  
I don't wanna put the hurt on you  
But you better believe me when I tell you  
That I finally got the dirt on you  
You're busted  
[Think you're gonna win this time]  
Yeah, she's finally gonna see the light  
[Drop a dime on you]  
This is how it's gonna be  
When she finds out that I was always right  
  
You're busted!

Perry  
You know you are a boys best friend  
Your more than just a passing trend  
Your like a tree from a candy store  
Oh Perry  
We love you more than ice cream cakes  
We love you more than bugs and snakes  
We love you more than all things mentioned from before  
Oh Perry  
Your extraordinary  
Your kinda short and hairy  
The color of a blueberry  
Yes Perry  
So come home Perry  
Come home perry  
Come home  
  
Oh Perry  
I think its kinda scary  
I can't find you any werey  
It fills me with despair  
Oh Perry  
I'm allergic to dairy  
I'm gonna move to the Prairies  
And change my name to Larry  
  
She change her name to Larry  
So come home Perry  
Come home Perry  
Come Home  
So come home Perry  
Come home Perry  
Come home  
  
Come home Perry  
Come home

When I was a boy down in South Illinois  
I heard a man playing blues what a wonderful noise.  
He had an old guitar but not a dollar to his name.  
Making music so sad but he was happy just the same.  
He gave me a wink and said son let me share the news.  
If you want a happy life you've got to learn to sing the blues.  
I asked my daddy for a guitar I begged and I plead.  
I said I wanted to play the blues and he just nodded his head.  
Daddy said when he was my age boogy-woogy was the thing.  
Just take the blues a round trip and add a little swing.  
Music has the power that without it he'd have sworn that he'd have never had
met my mom and I wouldn't have been born.  
So what's this?  
This is psychedelia  
It's where the guitar solo came from  
No I mean what with all the colors  
I have no idea  
  
I kept learning all the powers my guitar had  
I made it go walka-walka till it was so good it was bad.  
Just make a face and stop that face you can make that rhythm pump.  
So this is the blues just in a way that makes you want to shake your rump.  
I can make you clap your hands. I can make you do a dance.  
If you want to shake your booty my friend you've got to give the funk a
chance.  
  
Metal!  
Pound your fist in the air!  
Metal!  
Wave your head full of hair!  
It's crunchy and it's nasty full of bad attitude.  
Your parents will think you're crazy!  
Your neighbors will think you're rude!  
Believe it or not it's all the blues again!  
You just add a little fuss and turn your amp up to ten!  
Music has the power to change your life forever!

Everybody's sayin' we're naughty.  
It's gettin' really hard to take.  
So we've come to let the whole world know  
There must've been a mistake.  
  
So if Santa and his elves can here us,  
We hope we've been clear and concise.  
In the verses vice versus us,  
Vice versa: us versus vise!  
  
Danville is very nice!  
Santa please, check your list more than twice!  
Guaranteed!  
Danville is very nice!  
Santa please, check your list more than twice!

Stepping on the greens, in her designer jeans  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen  
Wearing plaid and sequins, she can make a scene  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen  
Like a picture from a disco golf magazine  
With her putter she's a hole in one machine  
She can dance and sing, and really shake her thing  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen  
She's a disco miniature golfing queen

Beautiful  
Kind  
And gentle  
And loving  
And softness  
And sweetness  
And candy  
And gum  
  
Peppermint  
And pink flowers  
And bunnies  
And happy songs we can all hum  
Draw a smiley face on the sun  
It's fun  
  
Slow down and look around you (All around)  
Throw your to do list away,  
The clouds look like sheep and vice versa  
On a do nothing day (on a do nothing day)  
On do nothing day.  
  
Sunshine  
Cuddles  
And puppies  
Wet noses  
And safety  
And laughter  
And skip to and fro  
  
Holding hands  
Cherry snocones  
And rainbows  
And no place where we have to go  
So we're just gonna go with the flow  
Well you know  
  
Slow down and look around you (All around)  
Throw your to do list away  
The clouds look like sheep and vice versa  
On a do nothing day (On a do nothing day)  
Our do nothing daaaay

[Verse 1]  
We consider every day a plus  
To spend it with a platypus  
We're always so ecstatic  
'Cause he's semi aquatic  
Our Ornithorhynchus anatinus  
Brings smiles to the both of us  
Life's never fuddie duddy  
With our webfooted buddy  
When we're brushing our teeth, It's better  
Tying our shoes, It's better  
Combing our hair, It's better  
Like we're a cheese sandwich and he's the cheddar  
Blinking our eyes, It's better  
Breathing in and out, It's better  
Sitting in a chair, It's better  
And taking a bath is just a little bit wetter  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Every day is such a dream  
When you start it with a monotreme  
He's duckbilled and he's beaver tailed and hairy  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything's better with Perry  
(Everything's better with Perry)  
Everything's better with Perry  
(Everything's better with Perry)  
Everything's better with Perry  
(Everything's better with Perry)  
Everything's better and we  
Just want to tell you Perry  
Everything's better with you.

(Whistle)  
Dr. D: Love was once a crazy dream.  
Girl: Now it's my new evil scheme, and I'm as happy as can be.  
  
Both: It's the age-old story how an evil boy, meets an evil girl. We've got a
love strong enough to rule the whole wide world. We both maniacally laugh, at
all the same stuff. I got my other half yes, I got an evil love.  
  
Dr. D: When our robot armies march,  
Girl: To the beating of our hearts. And I'm as happy as can be.  
  
Both: It's the age-old story how an evil boy, meets an evil girl. We've got a
love strong enough to rule the whole wide world. We both maniacally laugh, at
all the same stuff. You can't foil a plan that's built upon evil loooveee!  
  
Dr. D: evil loveeee!  
  
Girl: ooh... Hoo!

[Verse:]  
I want to be extraordinary  
Not just extra-ordinary  
It seems like everywhere I see  
People far more interesting than me  
I know the changes kinda scary  
But maybe I should try to vary  
  
[Hook:]  
Some minor details  
A small degree  
A slightly different version of me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Well I could learn to cook vegetarian  
Or take fashion workshop  
Meditate, calculate  
Learn to knit a tank top  
  
Yoga, hula  
Clogging, jogging  
Walking on a tight rope  
Take a correspondence course  
And learn to make my own soap  
  
Jumping on a pogo stick  
Standing in a wheat field  
Going on a snipe hunt  
Gonna keeps my eyes peeled  
Take a little time to really decorate my door  
And change my hair to black and then I'll dye it back orange  
  
Underwater taxidermy  
Shopping for a suitcase  
Peeling tangerines while placing second in a sack race  
  
Lion taming, online gaming  
Try'n to win a prize fight  
Appear in a talk show  
Dress-up like a water sprite  
  
Yeah!  
I'm gonna be extraordinary  
I'm gonna stand out from the crowd  
And shout out loud  
You'll see  
That it's a brand new me!!

Na-na na-na na  
Na-na na-na na  
Na-na na-na na, na na na na na-na  
  
Na-na na-na na  
Na-na na-na na  
Na-na na-na na, na na na na na-na  
  
Don't wanna hear no smack talk.  
You wanna call your mama, here's the dime.  
It's time to walk the walk walk.  
You got a reputation on the line. So get your game on,  
Or else it's shame on you.  
  
Gimme an "F"! (F! )  
Gimme an "F"! F Games!  
Are you a contender...  
Gimme an "F"! (F! )  
Gimme an "F"! F Games!  
In the battle of the genders!  
  
Na-na na-na na

Na-na na-na na

I don't need to tell ya what you already know,  
You're the one with style, you're the whole darn show,  
The other guys play their instruments fine,  
But next to you their looks are a crime.  
  
Well they say true beauty it comes from within,  
But your have to be comfortable in your own skin,  
So I exfoliate with this exotic cream,  
Just look at me, I look like a dream!  
  
You're the one, yes you're the star  
We need you back on bass guitar  
You're Fabulous (I'm Fabulous! )  
You're Fabulous (I'm fabulous! )  
You're the one we all can see, it's all about you (it's all about me! )  
You're Fabulous (I'm Fabulous! )  
You're fabulous (I'm Fabulous! )  
  
Now no two people are like each other  
So don't be a look-a-like copying another  
Unless of course you're copying me!  
Because that gives you individuality!  
  
Nice do! But back to the matter at hand  
So what do you say?  
Are you back in the band?  
  
Well maybe if I can fine my old leather!  
Dude! We're gettin the band back together!  
  
You're the one who sets the bar  
Your hairdo king, the fashion Tsar  
You're fabulous (I'm fabulous)  
You're fabulous (ooh I'm fabulous)  
You're the one we all can see, it's all about you  
(It's all about me! )  
You're Fabulous (I'm Fabulous)  
You're Fabulous (I'm Fabulous)

Monogram: Perry the platypus  
Is a lovely shade of teal  
From his duck-billed nose  
To his web-bed toes  
And his nerves were made of steel.  
  
Carl: What does this have to do with Christmas?  
  
Monogram: Well, I'm just describing him so that people have a mental  
Picture. It matches the original song.  
  
The night before Christmas  
Was a crisis at the Pole  
Cause old Doofenshmirtz  
He had done his worst  
And a sleigh that day, he stole  
  
Doof too it on a joyride  
Just as far as he was able  
But Doof, that goof, lost control  
Ran into the reindeer stable  
  
Now all the reindeer  
Were on crutches or in traction  
So old Agent P  
He knew that he must spring right into action  
  
Look at that platypus  
Look at that platypus  
Look at that platypus go  
Look at that platypus  
Look at that platypus  
Flying o'er the snow  
  
Carl: O'er sir?  
Monogram: It's a contraction. It means over.  
Carl: It's a bit archaic.  
Monogram: It's traditional Carl, get o'er it.  
  
So the reindeer were out of commission  
And Santa's sleigh was trashed  
I'd explain it more  
But we've been there before  
It doesn't need to be rehashed  
  
Santa Claus was freaking out  
Thought he'd have to scrap his run  
He was torn inside  
For without a ride  
He knew Christmas Day was done  
  
But then o'er the horizon  
Came a light bright as a star  
Cutting through the night  
Was the two headlights  
Of Perry's hovercar  
  
Perry the platypus  
Had a mission at the Pole  
If he could lend a hand in the frozen land  
He'd help Santa reach his goal  
  
There must have been some magic in that platypus-themed hovercar  
For when Santa saw the gas gauge  
He knew it could take him far  
  
Carl: Really sir?  
Monogram: They want this album yesterday, alright?  
  
Perry the platypus  
Took Santa on his way  
And he came through  
Like we knew he'd do  
And saved our Christmas Day

Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!  
Mow mow mow and my heart starts pumpin'  
Chika chika chu whop  
Never Gonna Stop Gitchi Gitchi Goo means That I Love You  
  
My baby's got her own way of talking  
Whenever she says something sweet  
And she knows it's my world she's a-rockin'  
Though my vocabulary's incomplete  
And Though it may sound confusing  
Sometimes I wish she'd give it to me straight  
But I never feel like I'm Losing (losing)  
When I take the time to translate  
That's what I'm talking 'bout  
  
Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!  
Mow mow mow and my heart starts pumpin'  
Chika chika chu whop  
Never Gonna Stop Gitchi Gitchi Goo means That I Love You  
  
When I don't know what to do (I don't know what to do)  
But I think I'm getting through (I think I'm getting through)  
'Cause when I say I Love You (I Say I Love You)  
She says I Gitchi Gitchi Goo You Too!  
Don't need a Dictionary  
  
(I said A) Bow chika bow wow, That's what my baby says!  
Mow mow mow and my heart starts pumpin'  
Chika chika chu whop  
Never Gonna Stop Gitchi Gitchi Goo means That I Love You (Baby, Baby...)

Baljeet: Good King Wenceslas looked out  
On the Feast of Stephen...  
  
Buford: Sorry I'm late. I was busy doin' some rewrites.  
Baljeet: Rewrites?  
Buford: I've highlighted your parts. Now sing along.  
  
Buford: Santa Claus and all his elves  
Are making gifts for Buford  
Baljeet: I don't think that's how it goes  
Buford: Nobody's askin' you, nerd  
  
Baljeet: Buford! You're completely disrespecting this classic song. You're  
Ignoring the historical context. King Wenceslas was a great man. You have  
No idea what this song is about!  
Buford: I know all about this song.  
  
Buford: The words were by an English guy  
The music, Scandanavian  
Wenceslas was five-foot-six  
He kept his face unshaven  
Though just a duke throughout his life  
He always ruled so justly  
His kingly title was conferred  
Upon him posthumously  
  
Baljeet: Well, I stand corrected. You seem to have a lot of information.  
But if you know so much about it, why do you not sing the original song?  
Buford: I like my version better. It's about me!  
  
Buford: Buford should get lots of gifts  
Every Christmas season  
When I see presents just for me  
It always is so pleasin'  
That is why I changed the words  
To make the song more edgy  
If you don't like the way I sing  
You'll get a Christmas wedgie

I bear lots of animosity to bellhops, they never bring my luggage up on time.  
And taxi drivers really tax my patience,  
If they vanished, would it really be a crime?  
I don't like meter maids or underwater welders,  
Health fanatic cooks or camera crews.  
Not fond of monks or yoga teachers, or sports fans in the bleachers.  
And I'm not sure how I'm feeling about you!  
There are lots of horrid people on this planet,  
That I would love to give a lashing to!  
But my goody-two-shoes brother, the favorite of my mother,  
He's the one I want to smother in a ton of pigeon goo!  
Yes, my goody-two-shoes brother, the favorite of my mother,  
He's the one I want to smother -- Thank you, Sir! I'll have another!  
He's the one I want to smother in a ton of pigeon goo!

Nowhere to go, nothing to see  
Except sand and sand and sand, and you and me  
  
Baked from the heat, we've got sun on all sides  
Getting tanned and tanned, like we're couple of hides  
  
Two lost nomads who will never be missed  
Some might interpret this  
As just a karmic slap on the wrist  
But I've just gotta say, it's a heck of a day to be us!  
  
It's a heck of a day to not have a car  
And just walk and walk and walk and not know where you are  
  
We've got no kind of map  
Nothing to shows us the way  
And it's just talk and talk and talk with nothing to say  
It's a heck of a day, heck of a day to be us!  
It's a heck of a day to be us!

(Spoken) It's frightfully difficult to be a lady.  
There's so many P's and Q's you have to mind.  
(Sung) But the rewards, I'm sure you'll find, are rich and varied,  
And worth all of the effort, you will find.  
Your posture must be perfect,  
Your diction crisp and clear  
Your speaking voice mellifluous and pleasing to the ear,  
Your legs are crossed when seated  
Your toes are pointed so  
Your pinkies raise while drinking  
But that's not all you need to know...  
  
(Tune changes to a heavier punk sound)  
  
You mustn't curse or spit or tattle, never gossip  
A lady never scratches, sweats, or burps  
She knows which knife and fork and spoon to use and when  
And if soup is served it's impolite to slurp  
  
It's always "please and thank you, sir or madam"  
Never brash or loud or putting on a show  
A lady is demure, reserved and proper  
And that is really all you need to know

I can do it, I can run, I can hunt you down.  
You can try, but you can't stop me 'cause I'm gaining ground.  
I'm light on my feet and I'm quick to the punch.  
I had a heavy breakfast, but a real light lunch.  
I'm a raging bonfire, a cherry bomb, I'm me.  
  
I'm rough-and-tumble, I'm the one to beat,  
I'm a fresh coat of blacktop burnin' at your feet.  
I've got a poisonous sting, when I rain I pour.  
I'm the best of the best, I'm the soupe du jour.  
  
I'm smooth as glass, and sharp as a tack, I'm me.  
I'm the last and best stick of the gum in the pack, I'm me.  
  
I'm a strong woman, fast-talking, big-bad-dog walking,  
High falutin', drum-beatin', foot stompin', corn-poppin',  
Speeding locomotive that just won't stop!  
I'm a hot apple pie with a cherry on top!  
  
I'm a crowd pleasin', head spinnin',  
Winnin' in the ninth inning,  
Whip-lashing, record-smashin',  
Black-tie party crashing!  
  
Cyclone of fun, I'm an army of one!  
I'm strawberry sprinkles on a hot cross bun!  
  
I'm a big haymaker in a title fight.  
I'm a cute black kitten with a nasty bite.  
I'm an action double-feature on a Friday night!  
  
I'm me!  
I'm me!  
I'm me!  
I'm me!  
I'm me!

Back in class, Evil 101...  
I always had so much fun...  
Though the one who advised me...  
Openly despised me...  
Still I always tried to be number one  
  
Well I wanted a mentor to share my world view  
But I got a tormentor, I was hated, it's true  
Now I have one more chance, and it could mean my advancement  
So there's only one thing I must do:  
  
I must impress my professor  
(He's got to be good)  
I must impress my professor  
(He's misunderstood)  
He needs validation for his evil creation  
  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Like any good evil scientist would  
  
I must impress my professor to be a success  
  
(He must impress his professor to be a success! )  
  
Or I will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey  
  
(Or he will still be a flunky, a diploma-less monkey)  
  
In the eyes of this person  
Whose opinion may worsen  
If my evil invention's not great  
  
I must impress my professor!  
(Impress his professor)  
I must impress my professor!  
(Impress his professor)  
I must impress my professor  
Before it's too late!

Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: It's not a party, it's an intimate get together!  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: Don't call it that, it's just a get together!  
Everyone: Candace party! Candace party!  
Candace: Don't spill your drink  
Don't drop your food  
Don't make the music in the house go boom  
Hey, don't use my mom's good scissors  
And please stay out of my room  
Take your feet off the chair  
No running in the house  
Put a coaster under that drink  
Hey, these tchotchkes aren't for juggling

Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
It's doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
Well, the fire is slowly dying  
And my dear we're still goodbying  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
La la la  
Let it snow

I need a kick drum,  
A guitar now,  
And a bass line,  
Gonna show you how,  
  
How to rock

How to get down,  
And all I need is a piano in my track now  
  
[Chorus:]  
Throw your hands

How to dance  
How to get down,  
Everybody on the floor now

Of all the stars in the sky tonight  
Compared to us  
Well they don't shine quite as bright  
  
[Chorus: X2]

Little Brother,  
I remember when you first came home,  
Then came another, little brother of our own.  
Even when you break my toys,  
You will always be my,  
Little brothers,  
'Cuz you're younger,  
We're related, and you're boys.  
Even when your making too much noise,  
You will always be my,  
Little brothers,  
'Cuz you're younger,  
We're related, and you're boys  
Little brothers,  
Little brothers,  
Little brothers.

Candace: Me, myself and I  
Don't see eye to eye  
Me, myself and I  
Don't get along  
Me, myself and I  
Can finally say goodbye  
This collaboration always felt so wrong  
Busting Candace: There's two of us on the scene  
And I don't want to sound mean  
But I'll tell you that I'm happy without me  
I've been holding me back  
But now I'm on my own track  
We're done. Finito, I'm free  
  
Romance Candace: From here on out  
We can both exist peacefully  
Without all of this struggle and internal strife  
Busting Candace: (Internal strife)  
Romance Candace: Now that we're separate, we can do anything  
So don't let the door hit you  
Have a nice life  
Busting Candace: (Have a nice life)  
  
Busting Candace: I'm through with myself  
I'm better off without her  
Romance Candace: (Myself and I)  
Busting Candace: I'm through with myself  
I'm better off without her  
Me, myself and I  
Don't get along  
Romance Candace: (Without her)

Candace: Mom, look, don't roll your eyes at me  
Mom, look, just come over and see  
Mom, look, it shouldn't be so hard  
Mom, look, they built it in the backyard  
Candace: Once they made it winter in June  
Linda: I didn't see it  
Candace: Built a rocket to the moon  
Linda: I didn't see it  
Candace: Mom, they cause me so much pain!  
Linda: Now, Candace...  
Candace: Once they even gave me Perry's brain  
Linda: Oh for crying out loud...  
  
Candace: They built a submarine, a time machine  
A haunted house that made me scream  
Drove cattle through the mall  
Built a giant bowling ball  
Blew me up to fifty feet  
A chariot dragged me down the street  
  
(Candace stops to catch her breath)  
(La la la la la la la la)  
  
Candace: Made their stupid clothes a fashion craze  
Shoelace tips a household phrase  
Shot me through a circus tent  
Always asked where Perry went.  
A lava flow destroy my face  
A giant roller derby race  
Thawed a caveman out of ice  
Built a roller coaster twice

My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme.  
My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme.  
  
I used to sit alone doin' evil all day,  
But now I think there's someone gonna get on my way, yeah,  
There's someone in my life that does'nt want me to exist,  
  
My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme  
And I feel fine cause I've got a nemesis.  
My neme, neme, oooo... My neme, neme, neme(x2)  
  
And I hate him, and he hates me,  
What a wonderful animosities,  
Besides his hat he wears no clothes,  
Now I have someone to oppose...  
  
Cause I've got a nemesis!

Major Monogram: Ahh... The world of a field agent. Out in the thick of things.
Not like me...  
My whole world is the screen, just four walls of a rectangle.  
(The screen goes black)  
But I would dare to b- carl!  
Carl: Oh. Sorry Sir. I thought you were done. Do you want me to turn them back
on?  
Major Monogram: Aw, forget it. The moment's gone.  
(Later on in the episode)  
Major Monogram: Oh, I hope Agent P is having good luck like I told him to.  
My whole world is the screen. Just four-

Carl: Oh, C'mon, sir!  
Major Monogram: No, Carl. The moment is gone.  
Carl: Sir?  
Major Monogram: I got cut-off twice already.  
Carl: But sir, you're very good!  
Major Monogram: I am?  
Carl: Yes, sir. I've heard you practice.  
Major Monogram: Well, I have been practicing.  
Carl: Yes, sir. And just like the song said: Carpe Diem!  
Major Monogram: Well, You can't argue with Latin, can you?  
Carl: No you can't, sir.  
Major Monogram: All rightly then. Ahem.  
My whole world is the scree-  
(End logo interrupts him)  
Oh come on!

You were a sub-standard dad,  
But the only one I had  
I grew up hearing your evil scheming down the hall,  
  
But when I look at this thing  
It makes me wanna sing:  
Maybe you're not so bad a dad after all...  
  
At my first ever swim meet,  
You stepped on the other team's feet  
At my recital, you clapped louder than you should.  
  
But when you taught me how to drive  
We actually made it home alive,  
I guess it's possible, not every part of you isn't good.  
  
I know at times I would cringe,  
Like when you wore all that fringe  
And when you went out of your way to catch that foul ball... (boos)  
  
But this piece of plastic in my hand  
Makes me finally understand:  
Maybe you're not so bad a dad,  
Not so bad a dad after all.

Phineas:  
Come let's tip-toe into the dark.  
One good scare ought to do it!  
You'll find our bite much worse then our bark!  
One good scare ought to do you some good!  
If you should find the daily grind a tad bit taxing on my mind to help unwind
it so inclined,  
I have a small suggestion!  
That if you dare into my lair you should prepare for quite A scare!  
But will you share in this nightmare, will be my only question.  
If your hair lies lifeless and limp, one good scare ought do you are.  
Come with me now don't be A wimp!  
One little scare ought to do you some good.  
That is quite right  
I would delight it taking flight into the night and finally give you such a
fright you know I surely would!  
But, if I seem a bit extreme at my attempts to make you scream.  
Remember that this spooky scheme will cure your hiccups for good!  
Scary Faces:  
One little (x4)  
Phineas and Scary Faces:  
One little scare ought to do you some good!  
Ferb:

When we lift off, then you'll be tipped off too,  
How my heart, it soars for you,  
Soon you'll be flying, gravity defying,  
Your dreams will all come true, in the blue,  
  
Flying over a cooton-candy clouds,  
Hanging from a fuselage,  
A walk on a wing, is just the thing,  
For a high in the sky montage,  
  
So darlin' put your goggles on,  
Up-up-and away we'll fly,  
In a big ginormous airplane,  
In a big ginormous airplane,  
In a big ginormous airplane,  
In the Sky!

Looking for a little fun  
Though without a friend in the world  
I was forced to find a new one  
  
Now I'm the queen of Mars,

It only took the magic portal to Mars  
To give me some self worth  
  
You put a crown on my head,  
And you all seem to worship me  
But you don't understand a word I say  
Still you treat me like royalty

I was invisible on Earth  
It only took the magic portal to Mars  
To give me some self worth

Rubber bands, rubber balls  
Made with super-special density  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
They can bounce with such intensity  
  
This is the room where we test the stretching  
This is the room where we test the bounce  
Here we add the long-chained hydrocarbons  
The names of which I cannot pronounce  
  
This is the room where we test compression  
This is the room where we test recoil  
This is a break room for all these dancers  
And here's a little fridge so the curry won't spoil  
  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
Made with super-special density  
Rubber bands, rubber balls  
They can bounce with such intensity  
  
Basically what we make here is rubber  
We're not trying to diversify  
We don't make knickknacks, we don't make tchotchkes  
Or really anything that's gonna catch your eye  
  
We don't make pianos, we don't make cream sodas  
We don't make the zippers for your parachute pants  
We don't make ice cube trays or ceiling fans  
We make rubber bands! [last note held until end of song]

Oh yeah! I have got something to say!  
  
I have been burned by vague lesson plans and a free-floating curriculum!  
I like my rules, baby, etched in stone, 'cause you know I am going to stick to
them!  
Can I get a syllabus a little discipline? Judge me on a scale from A to F!  
You wasted all my time learning how to rhyme, now let me hang it from a treble
clef!  
  
Somebody give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
I need the man keeping me down!  
Somebody give me a grade!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)  
Is there a red pen in this town?  
Somebody give me a grade!

I already said it, I need that extra credit today!  
(Somebody give me a grade, somebody give me a grade!)

I am stone cold honor role!  
I won't be told how to vent!  
I won't cry or sigh, I'm here to testify,  
Up with the establishment!  
  
My parents understand me, for conformity inside of me with which I can help
the system out!  
I ain't gonna waste my summer taking beatings from my drummer,  
Put a mic in front of me and I'll shout!

Phineas: Summer is runnin' through the sprinklers in your T-shirt, shoes and
jeans  
Rolling down a grassy hill, yeah, that's what summer means to me  
It's true  
There's so much more to do  
  
Phineas: The days are longer  
The nights are shorter  
The sun is shining  
Ferb: It's noticeably warmer  
  
[Chorus]  
Phineas: Summer, every single moment is worth it's weight in gold  
Summer, it's like the world's best story and it's waiting to be told  
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
  
[Verse 2]  
Summer is ponds and pools and garden hoses, tryin' to beat the heat  
Summer, bicycles and roller skates and even just bare feet  
It's also... Surfing tidal waves, creating nanobots  
Or locating Frankenstein's brain  
Finding a dodo bird, painting a continent  
Or driving our sister insane...  
Oh, wait. Maybe we're going too fast.  
  
Summer, it's crickets and cicadas and a glass of lemonade  
Summer, it's sitting with your brother in the backyard under the shade of a  
Big tree  
That's what it means to me  
  
The days are longer  
Phineas and 2nd Dimension Phineas: The nights are shorter  
The sun is shining  
2nd Dimension Ferb: It's noticeably warmer  
  
Phineas: Summer, every single moment is worth it's weight in gold  
Summer, it's like the world's best story and it's waiting to be told  
It's ice cream cones and cherry soda dripping down your chin  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
It's summer, man, where do we begin?  
  
Summer  
Where do we begin?  
Summer  
Where do we begin?

Well there's snow on the ground,  
There are sleigh bells all around,  
But the suns beating down because it's S'Winter,  
It's ski and snowball fight time,  
And also fly a kite time,  
Cold and sunny,  
Yes that's right,  
I'm talking about S'Winter,  
It's a S'Winter S'Wonderland,  
Unusual land grand,  
You can freeze while you get tan,  
Because it's S'Winter,  
Talking about S'Winter,  
It's a S'Winter.

Christmas morning, so much fun.  
Down the stairs the children run.  
Someone has eaten the cookies.  
And look what's left under the tree.  
There's presents for you and for me  
As far as the eye can see.  
What's on the rooftop  
I wonder what there was  
There's reindeer flyin' around the world  
Because Santa's comin'!  
I think we all should pause  
To say that we're grateful  
For everything he does.  
Thank you Santa Claus!  
Thank you Santa Claus!  
Woah...  
So for all the things you do,  
Santa Claus we're thanking you!  
So for all the things you do,  
Santa Claus we're thanking you!  
(Thank you Santa Claus!)

There's 104 days of summer vacation  
And school comes along just to end it  
So the annual problem for our generation  
Is finding a good way to spend it  
  
Like maybe...  
Building a rocket  
Or fighting a mummy  
Or climbing up the Eiffel Tower  
  
Discovering something that doesn't exist (Hey!)  
Or giving a monkey a shower  
  
Surfing tidal waves  
Creating nanobots  
Or locating Frankenstein's brain (It's over here!)  
  
Finding a dodo bird  
Painting a continent  
Or driving your sister insane (Phineas!)  
  
As you can see  
There's a whole lot of stuff to do  
Before school starts this fall (Come on Perry)  
  
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb  
Are gonna do it all  
So stick with us 'cause Phineas and Ferb are  
Gonna do it all!  
(Mom! Phineas and Ferb are making a title sequence!!)

Now, let me tell you all  
A story of a truck drivin' girl  
In a custom-made monster truck  
She took for a whirl  
That little speed demon  
Gonna be a star  
With a learner's permit  
And an adult in the car  
She may be out for a lark  
But she can parallel park  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
  
Well, someday she'll get her license  
And she'll have it all  
She can pick up her friends  
And take a drive to the mall  
That little redhead  
Gonna rock my world  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
She's a truck-drivin' girl  
  
She's a tire-spinning, gear-grinding,  
Clutch-burning, back-firing,  
Paint-trading, red-lining,  
Over-heating, throttle-stomping,  
Truck drivin' girl!

What kind of present does he dream about  
A leather wallet or a singing trout  
What I should get him is a mystery  
And if it's lame, will he still want me?  
What does he want?  
A dvd or some video games  
What does he want?  
Or maybe one of those new digital frames  
What does he want?  
Something to fit his personality  
What does he want?  
The perfect present is eluding me  
My friends all tell me that I shouldn't obsess  
But how can I avoid the stress?  
I need to know, but right now all I can do is guess  
What does he want?  
A fancy cell phone or a tube of grout  
What does he want?  
I don't know, but I'll figure it out  
What does he want?  
Rear-view mirror glasses as seen on tv  
What does he want?  
I only wish I knew what he got me...  
'Cause I hear it's perfect.  
What does he want?

Isabella: I'm just the curious girl 'cross the way  
Every day I come over and here's what I say...  
Whatcha doin', whatcha doin'  
What's the day's activity  
Whatcha doin', whatcha doin'  
By any chance, could it include me?  
  
Whatcha doin', whatcha doin'  
Fireside Girls: (Whatcha doin')  
Isabella and Fireside Girls: I don't mean to disturb  
Isabella: Whatcha doin', whatcha doin'  
Fireside Girls: (Whatcha doin')  
Isabella and Fireside Girls: You know it's not really directed at Ferb  
When I say-ay-ay-ay-ay  
What'cha doin'?  
  
Isabella: Don't you know, Phineas? You have no idea  
That every day I'm just dyin' to see ya...  
And say...  
  
Isabella: Whatcha doin', whatcha doin'  
Fireside Girls: (Whatcha doin')  
Isabella and Fireside Girls: I really wanna know  
Isabella: Whatcha doin', whatcha doin'  
Fireside Girls: (Whatcha doin')  
Isabella: Can I be part of the show  
Isabella and Fireside Girls: When I say-ay-ay-ay-ay  
Whatcha doin'?

When will he call me?  
When will it ring?  
Sometimes I think my sanity is hangin' by a shoestring  
  
When will he call me?  
How long is soon?  
Should I check my watch, my calendar or phases of the moon?  
  
And he doesn't have to call me  
He can e-mail me or text me  
My love is hanging by the phone is really vex me  
i check my messages you know how it affects me  
cause finding nothing in my inbox  
really hurts me  
  
When will he call me?  
(Oh woah!)  
When will he call me?  
When will he call me?  
Should I check my watch, my calendar or phases of the moon?

How could we be naughty when I'd thought we'd been so nice?  
Could we have been blinded to some little hidden vice?  
Did our visions of sugar plums not dance like they should?  
I'm racking my brain here, I really thought we were good.  
  
I know you've got that list and I know you check it twice.  
But could you check it again?  
'Cause it seems to me we were all pretty nice.  
(All except for Buford, 'cause he's got that whole last-minute reprieve
theory.)  
(It's gonna work! You watch! )  
  
Where did we go wrong?  
Please tell me!  
Where did we go wrong?  
Where did we go...  
Won't somebody tell me?  
Where did we go wrong?

You're goin' down) You're goin' down when I get mom to see  
(Down to the ground) This ridiculous monstrosity  
(You're goin' down) You'll never get away with this again  
(You're goin' down) You're G-O-I-N-G D-O-W-N  
(You're goin' down) Spread the news from coast to coast  
(Down to the ground) You're goin' down, your operation exposed  
(You're goin' down) I could say more, but I don't wanna boast  
(You're goin' down) Get used to butter, cause you both are toast!  
  
If a certain condition arises  
I'm the one to avert the crisis  
You think you're livin' large, but you forgot that I'm the one in charge...  
Conditionally!  
  
You're goin' down, down, down, down, down, down, down  
You're goin' down!
