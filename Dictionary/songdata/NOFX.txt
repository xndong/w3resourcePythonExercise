The first time I saw the Descendants, they were the fastest band I'd ever seen  
No one in the crowd really cared for them, we were waiting for the Alley Cats
to play  
After a couple months I heard Kabuki Girl, on Rodney on the Roq late Sunday
night  
That was enough, for me I hopped the bus, to Licorice Pizza and bought my all
time favorite record  
  
The next time I went to the Whiskey, it was DOA with Millions of Dead Cops  
The latter band played faster than I could believe  
But the songs sounded the same and kinda sucked  
'Cept John Wayne was a Nazi, and Joey Shithead was a drunk  
Then John Macias beat some hippie to a pulp, 'cause having long hair was a
mistake  
  
The third time I went to the hospital, I needed 13 stitches in my head  
I managed to catch about 6 rounds of Ill Repute, then some suicidal threw me
into a post  
My girlfriend started to cry 'cause we had to leave before DRI played fifty
lousy songs  
My blood stained shirt smelled of clove cigarettes  
But it sure looked pretty cool after a wash

It's so easy to defend the Status Quo  
With everyone so cool and cynical  
But when you see the end don't justify the means  
It's just that 180 degrees  
  
The great thing about bein' a human  
The ability to reason  
But reasoning don't work when no one cares  
2 parts apathy, one part despair  
  
Guess what, this might come as a surprise  
I'll no longer roll my eyes  
A change of heart to let the conscience breath  
One quick twist, just 180 degrees  
  
Yeah, I now know the right thing to do  
Yeah, anti tradition tried and true  
Yeah, a world where wrong has right of way  
Yeah, fuck that world, fuck that hierarchy  
  
Go ahead, work, waste your life away  
Fuck that world, go fuck that right away

They don't hates us, they just hate their lives  
And desperate people learn to despise  
The suicidles don't want a coup  
They don't want to blow up, they just want their 72  
  
72 virgins can never stop a war  
But 100.000 hookers can beat the marine corps  
I'm stopping hatred , fighting will cease  
When everyone is getting blow jobs  
That's when we'll finally have world peace  
  
How many million men have been killed in foreign wars?  
We need to reinstate the draft, enlist a million whores  
Start with the sororities and then all the spring breaks  
Ship the girls gone wild to Afghanistan  
They'll gladly blow the sheiks (a correct pronunciation)  
  
These holy wars aren't holy, it's not the military complex  
Terrorist are 16 year old kids who were promised jihad sex  
  
Maybe if they could see a woman's face  
They might not get onto that plane  
With a bomb in their suitcase  
  
72 virgins can never stop a war  
But 100.000 hookers can beat the marine corps  
In stopping violence, fighting will cease  
When everyone is getting blow jobs  
That's when we'll finally have world peace

Birds sing there's not a cloud in the sky August 8th is a beautiful day  
I see a bunch of hippies crying yeah August 8th is a beautiful day  
Like waking up from a real bad dream suddenly everything is OK  
The storm has passed the sun is shining yeah August 8th is a beautiful day  
What's going on what's going on is something bumming your scene  
There's something wrong there's something wrong I'm not trying to be mean  
The air is sweet the summer flowers blooming nowhere in sight is there
anything grey  
Feelings of joy are filling the street yeah beautiful day  
Like waking up from a fucked up dream suddenly everything's looking good  
There's been no permanent damage done  
Yeah August 8th came right when it should  
  
Poor Jeff  
Poor little  
Timmy Turtle  
Staying home on  
Such a beautiful  
Day

We don't care,  
Cause we're in a gang  
Parties that we go end up in a bang  
Look at us funny and we'll shoot you dead  
While we're there we'll fill 'em with lead  
We follow the gangs, we are the worst  
We'll be the last one,  
But we weren't the first  
We've been in a gang for a year and a half  
There goes our future,  
But we live in the past  
Let's go out, shoot some people tonight  
We use guns, cause we don't wanna lose the fight  
When we fight, it's 20 on 1 it's funny that way,  
It's much more fun everyone knows that we're so bad  
Our knives are long and our day is short  
Our nights our long, and our days are sad  
But we don't care cause we're in a gang  

If I want some beer  
I don't want to hear  
How I missed the show  
'Cause I drink to slow  
Pass me the beer bong  
It won't take very long  
For me to put down  
This torpedo to the ground  
Drinking beer is too slow  
Beer bong is the way to go  
To go, to go  
Don't drink too slow  
Beer bong, Beer bong  
Beer bong, Beer bong  
If I want some beer  
I don't want to hear  
How I missed the show  
'Cause I drink to slow  
Pass me the beer bong  
It won't take very long  
For me to put down  
This torpedo to the ground  
Drinking beer is too slow  
Beer bong is the way to go  
To go, to go  
Don't drink too slow  
Beer bong, beer, beer bong  
Bong, bong, bong  

Tired of shootin' smack, tired of on the run  
Traded the needle for the gun  
Tired of livin' small, tired of the withdrawal  
No more retreat time for attack  
  
Oh Benny how many times you tried to kill yourself?  
OD's and robberies and super stunts  
I never thought you'd die from them  
  
Riding around in tanks, fire a round of blanks  
Benny had never had such fun  
Until he took a wrong step into bomb  
And that's when Benny got blowed up  
  
Alone, under a blanket soaked with sweat and piss  
We figured Benny would end up like this  
We just didn't think for them

I've no consideration,  
Zero mutual respect  
For billions who suffer from  
Rational thought neglect  
I don't wanna waste a sentence,  
I don't want a convert-sation  
That's gonna end in disdain,  
Disbelief and aggravation  
  
And I find it's getting harder to hang out  
With grown adults who actually believe  
In Santa Claus and Noah's Ark  
And that their god is the best  
My distaste has turned into detest  
  
Who would read a 2000  
Year old medical journal  
Techniques for bloodletting,  
Advice on Trichinosis  
Would you navigate the globe  
With a map of a flat earth  
Without DNA testing,  
Would you believe virgin birth  
  
And I find it's getting painful to put up  
With grown adults who actually believe  
In Unicorns and Creation,  
And God always takes their side  
That's when my innocent jabbing turns snide  
  
Thank God for the Grammy,  
Thank God for the touchdown  
Thank God for blowing up  
The enemy's sacred ground  
  
So how am I supposed to take  
Anything you say seriously?  
When you've swapped free will for faith,  
How and pre-destiny  
  
And it's getting agonizing to hang out  
With grown adults who actually believe  
Mythology and history  
Trump physics and science  
My aversion has turned to abhorrence

I'll throw a pie in the face of piety  
I'll torch a torah right off a bridge  
I am a reverend of irreverence  
I'm a shill for any sacrilege  
I understand that faith in a deity  
Helps the masses who are having hard times  
But blasphemy like prostitution  
Are clearly victimless crimes  
Blasphemy, blasphe-you, Jesus Christ the blackest Jew  
  
Blasphe-you, blasphemy, poisonous pedagogy  
I'm an unbeliever, I'm a heretic  
I'm gonna projectile puke off a pew  
I'm a trouble making immature imp  
I'm gonna turn your other cheek for you  
I understand we all need something to believe in  
I believe I'll never be given wings and  
I'm sorry if it's up there cuz I didn't think  
A song was gonna hurt its feelings  
Blasphemy, speaking deadpan  
Apparently this god has got a master plan  
Now they call foul, pure heresy  
But ya gotta wonder, does he have a plan B?  
  
Horus similar to Mithra, Attis analogous to Krishna  
Jesus, different name same story  
All based on ancient Egyptian allegory  
My position hasn't been occulted  
It can never be more overstated  
My intelligence has been insulted  
So my tongue lashes out in defense  
Anything that is your holy or sacred  
I'm gonna desecrate and use in jest  
But you'll never hear a crack about Mohammad  
  
Cause I don't wanna get shot in the chest  
Blasphemy, isn't this fun  
Rob a rabbi, bugger a nun  
Blasphemy, want some more?  
Mother Mary, the virgin whore

How money polluted my mind  
Dough, what our lives are lived for  
Rae, just a crazy Aussie  
Me, the generation forges on  
Fo, dder for corporations  
Sew, wing our lives together  
LA, such a nice place to get shot  
  
But don't forget the T it  
Follows liber in the Constitution  
Following the part about pursuit  
Of happiness the bi product  
Of colonial precious metal  
Mine extracts which  
Brings us back  
To dough  
  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
Do do do do do do  
  
Today I saw a kid  
Torture a cat  
Too much leisure  
Teenage Norman Rockwell  
Paints it black!  
  
How, did the chain get started  
Mo, re is what everyone wants  
Ney, dy is what none of us are  
Co, operation died last night  
Rup, tured bleeding heart forsight  
Me, I'm just a loo  
  
So don't expect the best you won't be disappointed when you take  
A bite and watch the worm crawl back inside. listen to the  
Fairy tales of million dollar happiness,  
Los Angelistic lifestyle drinking  
Chardonnay over a lobster salad brunch  
  
Do do do do  
Do do do do  
Do do do do  
Do do do do  
  
The pursuit of million dollar happiness  
  
Happiness was killed we watched it bleed, some say it died from hate  
Some say from bleeding heart disease

He spent 15 years  
Getting loaded for 15 years  
Till his liver exploded  
Now what's Bob gonna do  
Now that he can't drink?  
The Doctor said: "What ya been thinking bout?"  
Bob said, "that's the point. I won't think bout nothing.  
Now I gotta do something else  
  
To pass the time  
Had someone shave his head  
He got a new identity  
62 hole air cushioned boots  
And a girl who rides a scooter  
To take him out of town  
They would get away  
Running around  
And as the trucks drive by  
You can hear the mother fuckers go "PUNK!"  
  
A couple of lines, an extra thermos of Joe  
He'll be kicking in heads at the punk rock show  
Bob's the kinda guy who knows just what  
Bob's the kinda guy who knows just what to do  
When the doctor tells him to  
Quit your drinking, now's the time  
But will he ever walk the line?  
To all my friends I feel just great  
But will he ever walk the line?  
  
Kicking ass, and busting heads  
Red suspenders  
Once a day he shaves his head  
But will he ever walk the line? [Repeat: x2]  
  
Bob!

We don't like him he's such a geek  
He wears funny glasses he has so many zits  
Bob Turkee the dick  
Bob Turkee the dick  
Bob Turkee the turkey  
Bob Turkee the dick  
  
He has a beer belly he doesn't drink beer  
He doesn't like girls he's such a queer  
Bob Turkee, he's such a dick  
Bob Turkee, he's such a dick  
Bob Turkee, he's such a dick  
Bob Turkee, he's such a dick  
Zits he's such a dick

You know it when it's over  
Door are closing feel the sober staring at you  
You know you better take one more good look  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
Smashing of the glass what a super sonic sound  
You gotta pull the plug when it's time to die  
Whoa whoa whoa, bottles to the ground  
  
There's a suitcase on the side walk  
There's some records in a milk crate  
She'll be staying  
You'll be throwing whiskey over one lip  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
Smashing of the glass a perfect imperfect sound  
You gotta pay the piper when the rats are gone  
Whoa whoa whoa, bottles to the ground  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground  
One more round then it's bottles to the ground

Have you ever gone to sleep with Bo Derek  
And woke up with Bo Didley?  
Have you ever gone to sleep with Bo Derek  
And woke up with Bo Didley?  
  
You got so loaded, you thought that she  
Was the most beautiful gal that you ever did see  
Yeah, have you ever gone to sleep with Bo Derek  
And woke up with Bo Didley?  
  
Woke up in the morning, to your surprise  
A couple melons in tube socks, and buggley eyes  
Yeah, have you ever gone to sleep with Bo Derek  
And woke up with Bo Didley?

The beer is better in Canada  
The people are better in Canada  
The hockey players are better in Canada  
But America has better hockey teams.  
  
The ecstasy is better in Canada  
The weed is better in Canada  
I hear the heroin is stronger in Canada  
But America has better cocaine  
  
The Prostitutes are Cheaper in Canada  
The strip clubs are cleaner in Canada  
Blow jobs cost 10 dollars in Canada  
But America has better crack cocaine.

She asked me if I was a singer then called me has-been  
She said she really like my band in the early 90's  
I said stop saying those mean things, my ego is so fragile  
And the she called me a poseur punk  
Why don't I drink up and get the hell out  
'Cause I'm a sellout  
  
That berating kinda bumped me out so I left the prakside  
I walked to my Volvo and noticed I had a couple slashed tires  
But adding injury and insult to vandalism  
Someone took a key to my door and boldly spelled out  
You're a sellout  
  
It says on the side of my car that I'm a sellout  
I play a Korean guitar but I'm a sellout  
I'm a sellout

I was walking on the avenue  
(Strolling)  
The heart opened to the unknown  
I wanted to say hello to anyone  
Anyone and that was you, I told you anything  
Just hadda talk to you, to tame you  
(Win over)  
  
On the Champs Elysees, on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun, under the rain, at midday or midnight  
There's whatever you want on the Champs Elysees  
  
You said I have rendezvous in a basement  
(Underground)  
With mad guys who live with guitar in the hand  
(Crazy)  
From evening til' morning  
  
So, I've accompanied you  
(Came with you)  
We sang, we danced  
And we even not thought about kissin'  
(Embracin')  
  
On the Champs Elysees, on the Champs Elysees  
Under the sun, under the rain, at midday or midnight  
There's whatever you want on the Champs Elysees

This is not a test of the Emergency Broadcast System,  
This is the Real Thing!!!  
And if you tape my voice, which you should never ever do  
You'll kiss your ass goodbye, I'm talking to you  
  
Got plans for helter-skelter  
Kids, Mom and Dad in the shelter  
Cowering with flag held high  
American will never die  
Make plans to rise once more  
And be ready for World War Four  
Who need civil defense?  
Who needs civil defense?  
  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, don't even try  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, we're all gonna die  
  
Won't matter who is first  
We'll be blown off the earth  
Don't try to survive the burst  
Rotting death is even worse  
Why try to survive that day?  
No one else will anyway  
Who needs civil defense?  
Who needs civil defense?  
  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, don't even try  
Civil defense, Civil defense  
Civil defense, we're all gonna die  
  
Fuck You!

When I was on the freeway, doing 70 all drunk  
A copper pulled me over, and I thought that I was sunk  
He came up to my car, I thought up a little trick  
I took a donut, jelly filled, and put it on a stick  
He came up to my window, and shouted to get out  
So I quickly took the donut and I shoved it in his mouth  
So I drove away, he shouted for some more  
So I threw it out the window and he ate it off the floor  
  
Cops and donuts  
Cops love donuts  
Cops love donuts  
Cops and donuts

(Performed by nofx)  
  
It's over before it starts  
Oh don't you know  
So on your marks, stand by, ready go  
From london to new york  
Montreal to tokyo  
I see visions of her  
Everywhere I go  
  
What have I become  
Now that I'm alone  
I'm just looking for a way to break  
Free of these walls and  
And I'm just looking for a place that  
I can call I can call my home yeah  
Has anybody out there got a soul  
Cause I'm just looking for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold  
  
She always comes once  
Again with her champagne taste  
She goes straight down the rat hole  
With her total recklessness  
And tomorrow will come on through  
And I got nothing but a silhouette girl  
Met her in the darkness  
  
And I say...  
What have I become  
Now that I'm all alone  
And I just looking for a way to break free of these walls and  
And I'm just looking for a place  
That I can call my home  
Has anybody out there got a soul  
Cause I'm just looking for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold  
You know I'm just lookin for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold  
  
Yeah I'm in a corner  
I'll start over  
Start the whole slate clean  
All the pain and heartache and all the years  
I was always to blame  
I dream of this girl  
??????  
Met her in my neighborhood  
I'm a downtown member in a dark lot  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
I'm a downtown member in a dark lot  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
  
Don't let me be misunderstood  
  
I'm just looking for a way to break free of these walls yeah  
I'm just looking for a place I can call my home  
Has anybody out there got a soul  
I'm just looking for a girl  
The girl with a heart of gold

Don't believe a word your grandfather says  
He's been classified grade A psycotik  
You can see it from the hole in his head  
A saner man would have used a bigger gun  
  
Degeneration ah ah ah ah ah  
The lunatic clause was written for you  
  
The story spoken is the story unheard  
By you so listen cause it's unbelievable  
A certain trait has passed while centuries turned  
This certain trait has been a family tradition  
  
No simple way to tell you son  
We share the same red tainted blood  
I'm gonna kill me, you're gonna kill you  
Killing you  
  
Don't believe a word your grandfather says [Repeat: x3]  
He's a psycotik, grade A psycotic

I trusted you at least I thought I could  
I tried to believe when you said  
I got a better job I can pay you back  
Real soon. No! I don't do those drugs no more  
I know my luck has changed my lifestyle  
Has rearranged I'm on my feet  
  
You'll never change your ways  
Living from day to daze  
Why don't you fade away  
  
I've heard all this before  
When you were sleeping on my floor  
You said only for a day  
But as those 3 weeks passed  
My patience didn't last nor my food

Rationalize values it's so easy to succeed  
Keeping your eyes on the prize excess  
  
Camped outside laissez faire  
People understand me there  
Don't talk to me we'll get along just fine  
  
Blowin' out your mores  
Herny Ford tradition plays on  
Idel minds left the emergency brake on too long  
Underneath the city lies the ruin of mankind  
  
The excavation was a financial success  
With artifacts of gold  
The arrowheads went straight to the Smithsonian  
The rest was melted down and sold  
  
Substantial gains  
Minimal losses are tolerable  
As long as the machine keeps running fine  
  
Cannibals  
Functioning on pheromones  
Rational thought lost to instinctual

Keep back, watch it crumble  
See the drownin, watch the fall  
I feel just terrible about it  
That's sarcasm, let it burn  
  
I'm gonna make a toast when it falls apart  
I'm gonna raise my glass above my heart  
Then someone shouts that's what they get  
For all the years of hit and run  
For all the piss poor bands on VH1  
Where did all their money go  
Don't we all know  
Parasitic music industry  
As it destroys itself  
We'll show them how it's supposed to be  
  
Music written from devotion  
Not ambition, not for fame  
Zero people are exploited  
There are no tricks up our sleeve  
  
Were gonna fight against the mass appeal  
Were gonna kill the seven record deal  
Make records that have more than one good song  
The dinosaurs will slowly die  
And I do believe no one will cry  
I'm just fucking glad I'm gonna be  
There to watch the fall  
Prehistoric music industry  
Three feet in La Brea tar  
Extinction never felt so good  
  
If you think anyone will feel badly  
You are sadly mistaken  
The time has come for evolution  
Fuck collusion, kill the five  
  
Whatever happens to the handshake  
Whatever happens to deals no-one would break  
What happens to integrity  
It's still there it always was  
For playing music just because  
A million reasons why  
(All) dinosaurs will die  
(All) dinosaurs will die  
(All) dinosaurs will die

Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
The connotations wearing my nerves thin  
Could it be semantics generating the mess we're in?  
  
I understand that language breeds stereotype  
But what's the explanation for the malice, for the spite?  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
I wasn't brought here, I was born  
Circumcised, categorized, allegiance sworn  
Does this mean I have to take such shit  
For being fair skinned? No!  
  
I ain't a part of no conspiracy, I'm just you're average joe  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Represents everything I hate  
The soap shoved in the mouth to cleanse the mind  
The vast majority of sheep  
  
A buttoned collar, starched and bleached  
Constricting veins, the blood flow to the brain slows  
They're so fuckin ordinary white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Oh, we're better off this way?  
Oh, say what you're gonna say  
  
So go ahead and label me an asshole  
'cause I can  
Accept responsibility for what I've done  
But not for who I am  
Don't call me white, don't call me white  
Don't call me white, don't call me white

These two shots are for Derrick  
For Rifle, not the handgun  
For Coffee and Cigarettes  
Give It Back  
  
You know, suicide isn't painless  
When you leave everyone in pain  
Two shots will never go down the same  
  
This beating's for Jimmy  
For Ultimate Devotion  
For your Mind Of My Own  
Bring Out Your Dead  
  
Sedated, flagellated  
You were the one most loved and hated  
Thanks for all that carpet and your songs  
  
This Petron's for Jason  
This lager's for Andy  
And these doses are for Bomber  
And this fix is for Bradley  
This ritalin's for Lumpy  
And this speedball's for Friday  
This nitrous hit is for Lynn and best friend Dobbs  
  
This bowl is for my mom  
For drinking more than I did  
For posting bail for me in New York  
  
And in Hollywood that first time  
And that joint we smoked was the worst time  
Cause doing drugs with parents is just wrong  
  
This Petron's for Jason  
This lager's for Andy  
And these doses are for Bomber  
And this fix is for Bradley  
This song is for winning losers  
It's for lucky substance abusers  
The ones who left their black marks on us all

We believe in a drug free America  
A drug free America for me  
That's the way we believe  
The way that it should be  
  
Drug free America for me  
  
Like in Amsterdam where drugs  
Are bought and sold legally  
Let's take it one step further  
And make them all for free  
  
Drug free America for me  
  
Say "nope to dope" when its not for free  
Say "ugh to drugs" save your money  
Don't listen to facts just sit back  
And relax and help make our country  
Drug free

Dresser drawers are filled with pocket change  
Coupons cut, smokes down to the butt  
Is this what dreams are made!?  
  
Adding up subtracting down you find  
Yourself sucking the rind  
  
Dying degree, graying amie  
  
Final payment made - had you forgot?  
The rightful owner of one deluxe cemetery plot  
Paisley satin lined how apprapoe  
What a better way to go  
  
Dying degree, graying amie  
  
No more eating crumbs  
When my pension finally comes  
You kids won't eat mush anymore 'round me  
  
Dying degree, graying amie

[Chorus:]  
why mussed oui stay wear wee don't bee longe  
why mussed oui stay wear wee don't bee longe  
  
Because there's never gonna be enough space  
So eat the meek, enjoy the waste  
It's always gonna be a delicacy  
Lick your chops and eat the meek  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The factory mass produced fear, bottled,  
Capped, distributed near and far  
Sold for a reasonable price  
And the people, they love it, they feed it  
Brush with it, bathe with it, breathe it  
Inject it direct to the blood  
It seems to be replacing love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Because there's always gonna be token truth  
Forgotten code discarded youth  
You know there's always gonna be pedigree  
One own the air one pay to breathe  
  
[Chorus]

What happened to Bruce, Eddie, and Paul?  
Paul and Eddie had it good  
But Paul loved his cocaine and Eddie hated punks  
So after a couple years  
Eddie broke it off with Paul to look for a new man  
  
Paul got fucked, fucked by Steve  
Eddie's at the Red Lion looking for a new steed  
Searching for a beau who sings in falsetto  
  
What happened to Bruce, Eddie, and Paul?  
What happened to Eddie, Paul, and Bruce?  
Bruce and Samson knew  
Eddie was looking for a long term, stable relationship  
With Paul no longer around,  
Bruce left Samson for Eddie cause Steve convinced him to  
  
Kudos to Paul, fuck you Bruce  
How you supposed to rock n' roll without substance abuse  
Number of the Beast is in bed with Rob and Judas Priest

Get out of my way,  
Can't you see I'm from LA?  
Yeah, I met Slash, I've got a rose tattoo  
I bet I know way more people than you  
  
I just love this town,  
My girlfriend weighs 84 pounds  
Met her at the Cat house where I get in for free  
She pays the rent while I watch T.V.  
  
When we go out tonight,  
Gotta get my hair just right  
Tight black pants a blue suede shoes  
I'll get my picture in Rock City News  
  
Gotta get those flyers out  
Might meet a talent scout  
And he will talk contracts with me  
My fame and fortune and MTV

Thirty nine, my hair should be parted not spiked and green  
My nights should end at ten and not six AM  
But it is and they don't  
I still get excited when the Adolescents play  
Wake up not knowing what I did last night  
Finding out and thinking that was cool, not sad  
  
I might be an adult but I'm still a minor at heart  
Okay, my liver is my senior part  
But that's a part you can trade in  
When your band has been a band longer than the Ramones  
And critics coin you "the punk Rolling Stones"  
That's when you know this is for life

With my Fan Mail  
  
So I would like to know just if and when  
You'll be in town again  
So that I could meet with you  
And brag at my friends at school  
Have you been all around the world  
Have you seen every kinda of girl  
Or are you from the other side  
  
Cause you  
You can't believe everything that you read  
With the hypocrisy and the greed  
The papers all the things that they say  
They don't tell me anything anyway  
That's why I've gotta get it straight from you  
Without an obligation  
  
My Fan Mail (oohs and ahhs)  
  
What's this I find to my surprise  
Those fans that I idolized  
No longer seem to exist  
Now tell me what can be the cause of this  
Perhaps it could be their egos  
I tell you heaven only knows  
I didn't even get a newsletter  
  
Fan Mail send it out to me  
Fan Mail Special delivery

My father used to say  
You sleep with dogs the next day  
You'll wake up in the bed scratching  
Those inevitable fleas  
At ten years old  
You listen to what you're told  
But I never felt the itch  
I never would  
  
My mother had forbidden me  
To waste away my life  
I want you to have all the things  
I could never buy you  
So don't stop what I'd begun  
You're my one and only son  
Follow what I say, not what I've done  
Follow what I say, not what I've done  
  
Shower, scrub, and shave  
Cleanly boys don't misbehave  
  
Follow what I say, not what I've done

I never thought abouit the universe, it made me feel small  
I never thought about the problems of this planet at all  
Global warming and radioactive sites  
The imperialistic wrongs and animal rights, NO!  
  
Why think all the bad things when life is so good  
Why help with an "am" when there's always a "could"  
Let the whales worry 'bout the poisons in the sea outside of California, it's
foreign policy  
No I don't want changes I've no reactions your dilemmas are my distractions  
  
That's no way to go Franco Un-American, that's no way to go Franco Un-American  
  
I never looked around never second guessed, then I read some Howard Zinn now
I'm always depressed  
And now I can't sleep from years of apathy, all because I read a little Noam
Chomsky  
I'm eating vegetation 'cause a Fast Food Nation, I wear uncomfortable shoes
'cause of globalization  
I'm watching Michael Moore expose the awful truth, I'm listening to Public
Enemy and Reagan Youth  
I see no world peace 'cause of zealous armed forces, I eat no breath mints
'cause they're from de-hoofed horses  
Now I can't believe what an absolute failure, the president's laughing 'cause
we voted for Nader  
  
That's no way to go Franco Un-American, where can we go Franco Un-American  
I want to move north and be a Canadian, or hang down low with the nice
Australians  
I don't want to be another I don't care-ican, what are we gonna do Franco
Franco

I'm on the wagon now but she doesn't know  
I'm getting high on the down low  
Cause when I got the music I got no place to go  
Unless I got a bottle in me  
  
I'm in the Cadillac, they're starting to stare  
Who's the guy with the blood in his hair  
The last thing I remember I was going somewhere  
And then the stop sign got in the way  
  
I'm laying low in a hospital bed  
I gotta a dent and a crack in the head  
That's okay cause I got no idea what I just said  
Gotta love the hospital meds  
  
I'm getting high on the D.L.

Glass war, glass war, glass war, glass war, it's a glass war  
Glass war, glass war, it's a glass war  
Glass war, glass war  
  
It's a glass war  
'Cause you can see right through the poison  
It's a glass war  
'Cause we all know the activities  
It's a glass war  
'Cause it's made of smoke and mirrors  
It's a glass war  
It's a glass war  
It's a glass war  
'Cause only poor men are dyin' in the  
Gas war  
'Cause we know why it was started  
It's an ass war  
'Cause the president's an asshole  
It's an ass war  
It's a glass war  
It's a gas war  
'Cause the starters are all victims of the  
Glass war  
The slogan men were starters of the  
Last war  
Now the southern men are starters of the  
Glass war  
It's a glass War  
It's a glass war  
  
And the shards are gonna start another glass war  
And the shards are gonna start another glass war  
And the shards are gonna start another glass war  
And the shards are gonna start another glass war  
And the shards are gonna start another glass war  
It's a glass war  
It's a glass war

I'm overhung overslept ripe  
Disheveld perfectly  
Unkempt I like my drink  
Mit toast and eggs  
  
The best bloody Mary you've  
Ever tasted - go to work  
Wasted - go to work bombed  
Ya gotta pull a shot before  
  
You start the job I want to  
Operate heavy machinery I  
Want to watch online pron  
You gotta go to work high if  
  
You're gonna get paid low  
You gotta put your nose to  
The grind stone stoned  
That elbow grease will get  
  
You fuck you want to be  
A jerk or a big jerk

Lovin you isn't the right thing to do  
How can I ever change things that I feel?  
If I could, baby I'd give you my world  
But how can I when you won't take it from me  
You can go your own way  
You can call it on the lonely days  
You can go your own way  
Tell me why everything turns around  
Backin up, shaking it's all you wanna do  
If I could, baby I'd give you my socks  
Open up, everything's waiting for you  
You can go your own way  
You can call it on the lonely days  
You can go your own way  
  
  

Sitting in a room waiting for some news  
Sitting in a room with white knuckles  
Not feeling so good  
I didn't do the things I should  
  
I said "Doc, tell me what's wrong with me"  
He had this expression he didn't know what to say  
"It seems that you've contracted a new strain."  
  
How could this happen to me?  
Another victim another casualty  
From fucking casually, another casualty  
  
All the times I should have worn a jimmy hat  
All the times I said "What the fuck,  
I won't look back, that's not for me"  
I wouldn't listen to reason  
Now look at me

Sometimes I think of all the places where I don't want to go  
Then I think of all the things I don't want to do  
And when I think of all the people I don't want to meet  
I close my eyes and go to sleep  
  
Tully, baby, you're trapped behind your golden bars  
I'm the prince of poverty hangin' out in bars  
Your life's a Mercedes, a mansion with a pool  
My life's on a bus stop just waiting for some fuel  
  
Your obviousness disgusts me I see through your macho lies  
I'll fight everything you stand for  
There's something in your purse baby, my head is getting sore  
Maybe what we had was just green corn

Hello dear there somthin' on my mind  
There somethin' between us I can't find  
Can please please show me the light  
Because with you I refuse to fight  
  
It's cause you have a new girlfriend  
She gives you better head then me  
It's cause that guy that you hide  
I heard he can make you scream  
  
I guess I'm a shmo  
You have better people to fuck then me  
I guess that I'm the jerk  
That lets you fuck who ever you please  
  
We used to have such good times  
You lay before me as I tell you my mind  
I listen as you talk about some girl  
You said some day she'd be your wife  
  
I guess I'm a shmo  
You have better people to fuck then me  
I guess that I'm the jerk  
That lets you fuck who ever you please  
  
  
By the way Bitch! You kiss my god damn ass  
Eat shit and die you dirty fuckin' slut  
Fuck off you stupid fuckin' cunt  
I hope you choke on toxicshock  
You fuckin' Duchebag

Don't want to chill, don't want to sit  
Don't want to hear no chippy shit  
Don't tell me I've closed my mind  
  
Don't want to groove don't want to dig  
Don't want to spend the day naked  
Don't like my music country fried  
  
He's got a tye dyed Rancid shirt  
Wears his Birkenstocks to work  
Is he a jerk? No! Just confused  
Jeff don't wear regular shoes  
  
Fat Mike I gotta let you know  
It's not the tunes, it's their live show  
And all the people you get to meet  
Plenty of good vibes and decent drugs  
Stinky people give you hugs  
Walk around in your bare feet  
  
He's got a tye dyed Rancid shirt  
Wears his Birkenstocks to work  
Is he a jerk? No! Just confused  
Jeff don't wear regular shoes  
Jeff don't wear regular shoes

Whoa yeah, whoa yeah kill all the white man  
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah kill all the white man  
  
The white man call himself civilized,  
'Cause he know how to take over,  
The white man come to pillage my village,  
Now he tell me I have to bend over.  
  
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah kill all the white man  
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah kill all the white man  
  
No I do not like the white man up in me,  
He rape my people as he rape my country,  
Everything I love and cherish, he try to take away,  
We will be rid of him, soon come the day.  
  
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah kill all the white man  
Whoa yeah, whoa yeah kill all the white man  
kill all the white man  
kill all the white man  
kill all the white man  
kill all the white man

"Kill the rockstars" how ironic, Kathleen  
You've been crowned the newest queen  
Kinda like the punk rock Gloria Steinham  
You can't change the world by blaming men  
Can't change the world by hating men  
  
Just cause I don't know the reason you're so pissed  
Don't dare tag me misogynist  
I thought the goal here was mutual respect  
Not constructing a separate sect  
I wish I could have seen Courtney  
Demonstrate some real mysoginy  
Can't change the world by hating men

I wish I could go  
Off far away  
Where time moves too slow  
Day after day  
  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by  
  
I have a fixation with laziness  
Procrastination, is what I do best  
  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by  
  
Where has my ambition gone  
I haven't seen it for so long  
Am I a burden to someone  
  
Life, I am so tired  
Of everything  
All my desire  
Is vanishing  
  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The clouds as they pass by  
I'll wait, and I'll sit and watch  
The crowds as they walk by

Breath, ever so soft  
We wouldn't want to break the eggs as we walk  
Leave it alone  
Follow the grain  
We couldn't stop the irresistible force  
  
Leave it the same  
Change with the leaves  
Bringing in the new  
Ringing out the old  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
  
Breath, ever so slight  
We couldn't take away your god given right  
Leave it alone  
Heal and stay  
Roll over and beg for the bone  
Leave it alone  
  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah nah nah  
Nah nah nah nah nah

We call the heartland not very smartland, IQ's are very low but threat levels
are high  
They got mandate, they don't want man-dates, they got so many hates and people
to despise  
  
In the dust bowl, cerebral black hole, the average weight is well over 200
pounds  
I hate to generalize, but have you seen the thighs, most haven't seen their
genitalia in a while  
  
Maybe that's why they're so pissed at us  
They're all jealous we're having better sex  
  
Queers, transgends, and lesbians, vegans and vegetarians  
All you brownish red and yellow ones come out and join us on the coast  
  
No longer svelte, they got to punch new holes in the Bible belt  
They've blown out the fire under the melting pot, the red blood of America is
starting to clot  
No compromise, no sight through others' eyes, they're just flies spreading
pieces of shit  
You gotta emigrate, stop living in hate, what makes this country great is
dwelling on either side  
  
They don't want visitors in Jesusland  
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland  
  
We want people with college degrees, drug use experience and STD's  
People with open-minded philosophies, come hug California trees  
Cultural revolution now, neo-conservatives run outta town  
We're gonna burn Orange County down,  
And then we're off to Riverside, Bakersfield and Fresno too, then we're comin'
after you  
  
The fear stricken, born again Christian, they got a vision a homogenized state  
Texas textbooks, Bibles, and prayer books,  
They want them memorized, but don't want you to think  
  
They don't want visitors in Jesusland  
They want life bland and canned in the fatherland  
  
Punk Rockers and emo kids, people doin' things the church forbids  
Buddhists, agnostics, and atheists we're moving out of jesusland  
Art students and thespians, (excluding country) all the musicians  
We want all hookers and comedians, nihilists are welcome too  
  
No longer svelte, they gotta punch holes in the Bible belt

Possessions never meant anything to me  
I'm not crazy (Cause I got none)  
Well that's not true, I've got a bed and a guitar  
And a dog named Bob who pisses on my floor  
That's right, I've got a floor  
So what, so what, so what?  
  
I've got pockets full of Kleenex and lint and holes  
Where everything important to me just seems to fall right down my leg  
And on the floor  
My closest friend linoleum  
  
Linoleum  
Supports my head, gives me something to believe  
That's me on the beach side combing the sand  
Metal meter in my hand  
Sporting a pocket full of change  
That's me on the street with a violin under my chin  
Playing with a grin, singing gibberish  
That's me on the back of the bus  
  
That's me in the cell  
That's me inside your head  
That's me inside your head  
That's me inside your head

I will never feel the ribbon break  
I will never taste sweet victory  
I don't want to leave the rest behind  
I don't want inscription on a plaque  
  
Never first or second place  
I won't ever run your rat race  
I will always be lower than you  
I won't be your competition, lowest  
Totem pole position is where I'd rather  
Stay than be like you  
  
I don't feel the animal instinct  
I am not on top of the food chain  
The only battle I will fiercely fight  
Is one that hibernates inside my head  
  
Be the best, climb the ladder  
Do it better, higher, faster  
I refuse to participate  
If I go up it will be slow I'm bringing  
Everyone I know and stopping on the  
Sixth of seventh rung  
  
On a pedestal, isn't the veiw great  
You better watch your step cause it's  
A nasty fall, when no one's there to  
Catch you when you call

There's a place where some of us choose to live  
A gated community cops can't come in  
A neighborhood for punks over the hill  
We're spendin' our golden years in Mattersville  
  
We can do whatever we want whenever we please  
There's always a keg of beer and a block of cheese  
We got charams, pinball, asteroids, space invaders and missile command  
  
We will grow old together we will play bridge and Texas hold 'em  
Duane and Stevie Cab they still skateboard  
But most of us lawn bowl and shuffleboard  
We may be getting ripe but we ain't bored  
  
We got a blackboard with some rules and laws  
Hefe's got an 18 car garage  
Most of the cars are smashed but so is Spike  
Twice a week on karaoke night  
  
Eric Melvin lives next door to me  
Limo and the Locknecks head security  
At the end of my cul de sac  
Davey Havoc's house is painted black  
  
We will grow old and fatter  
We got our ville nothing  
Else matters Trashy, Mod,  
And Kath are staying up  
  
Nathan, Matt and Dad  
Are passing out when  
California cracks  
We're all goin' down

Hangin' out with Lars down on 6th street he knew that I was in trouble  
I was feeling much like the devil  
There was something burnin' deep inside of me  
Ran into three Puerto Ricans these girls took us to the fun house  
Where we played a lonely pinball machine  
Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin' by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia  
I'm having a hard time understanding, it gets all too demanding  
She's all gone and I'm stranded  
Something burning deep inside of me  
All I know it's 4'o'clock and she ain't never showed up  
And I watched a thousand people go home from work, yeah  
Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin' by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia  
How many times will it take me before I go crazy?  
Before I lose everything?  
Something burning deep inside of me  
Ran into three Puerto Ricans those girls took us to the fun house  
I don't wanna be alone again  
Hangin' on the corner of 52nd and Broadway  
Cars passin' by but none of them seem to go my way  
And New York City well I wish I was on a highway  
Back to Olympia  

Hangin' out in long beach.  
A lil' party in the sun, but ya just can't sit there smoking and drinking
anymore.  
You got a new jive. All your friends are getting weird. Ahhh!  
It goes, "you ain't a shakin till the shit shot.  
  
Shoot it up.  
No one jammin' til the gin juice jigger jets.  
They say it ain't a party til the party enema, the party enema.  
You get a funnel tube, pour in a 40 oz.  
  
Pull down your clothes, touch your toes.  
Get a hose, hold your nose.  
It's a party hat. Forget the beer bong.  
Forget the nitrous shots.  
  
It goes "you ain't a shakin' 'til the shit shot.  
Shoot it up.  
No one jammin' til the gin juice jigger jets.  
They say it ain't a party 'til the party enema, the party enema.  
  
The party enema, the party enema.  
The party enema, the party enema...

There's something wrong with mass consumption  
Why do we want what we don't need  
Alcohol burn it clean asphalt methamphetamine  
Will make it seem alright, it's gonna make it seem alright now  
Living in the hunger underground  
  
Some people say I got a problem with authority so  
What if I do man it beats relinquishing control  
Philthy Phil Philanthropist  
You've taken when you should of give away  
Philthy Phil you gave to us  
More than we cannot repay  
  
There's something grand about being nothing  
There's something lame about being grand  
Alcohol squirting gun don't want no holidays in the sun  
That's me not being you, that's just me not being you are  
Either a part of the solution or the problem  
  
Can there not be a middle ground for just the anybody  
Replace Superman with Joe Ordinary  
Philthy Phil Philanderer  
You've taken when you should of gave away  
Filthy Phil you gave to us  
More than we cannot repay

You fight for peace, but where's the war what the fuck are doing this for  
You say disarmament that's the key well that's not the way it looks to me  
You wear you leather jacket but you won't eat meat piece punk, get drunk,  
Sake you hair go out, hang out do you really care? there's no easy answers  
Complaining won't do shit if you want some changes, don't be a hypocrite  
Fuck the system that's what they say but they live by it everyday food stamps  
And welfare checks would you rather starve to death you wear your leather  
Jacket but you won't eat meat piece punk, get drunk, sake your hair go out,  
Hang out, do you really care don't you feel ridiculous now! half your  
Wardrobe comes from a cow do you believe in anarchy? who are you  
Really trying to be?  

Martian men are coming to Earth  
They're abducting all of the jerks  
Martian men are coming to Earth  
Martian men don't take me  
  
Pods are landing from outer space  
Pods are duplicating my face  
Pods are landing from outer space  
Pod thing leave me alone  
  
I don't know what conventions you go to  
I don't know what movies you've seen  
I don't want to hear explanations  
For unexplainable things  
  
It's not I don't believe in aliens  
It's just I really don't care  
I wouldn't mind some interplanetary friends  
Until they come and hang in my own atmosphere  
  
Holy ghost is coming to Earth  
Saving souls of all of the jerks  
The holy ghost is coming to Earth  
Savior men don't take me  
  
The number one son is flipping the tab  
Paying for sins and fun we all had  
The number one son is flipping the bill  
Let me chip in for the tip  
  
I don't understand why you beg for forgiveness  
Just before you do it again  
Is it more altruistic to worship  
Or actually help fellow man  
  
It's not I don't believe in Jesus Christ  
It's just I care about other things  
The world could certainly use some miracles  
Until then I'll put my faith in human beings

One time weekly rate twelve by twelve room  
Strapped down to the bed now pump up the Valium  
My mind is wide asleep my conscience deep awake  
The promises I keep are not the ones I make  
I count the caustic causes I lost count of regrets  
A surplus of good intentions don't provide me with content  
All I want is just a little content  
  
One time monthly rate still no breathing room  
Pressures building up so pump up the Valium  
I choose the beaten path I've been to where it leads  
Why I keep comin' back a mystery to me  
I found what I've been seeking but it's too late for me to care  
My aspirations leaking form a hole I can't repair  
Maybe I just don't want it repaired

Crazier than GG, yet more PC than Ian  
Got colored teeth like Johnny  
Exudes a vicious disposition  
His hair sticks out like Colin' did, he jumps  
  
Similar to Springa, he points his middle finga  
Not just he singer in the band  
Voted biggest asshole and role model of the year  
Got a face like Charles Bronson  
  
Straight outta Green Bay Wisconsin  
Not just a singer in the band  
He'll puke on you, he'll fuck your mom, he'll smoke while huffing gas  
He was the punkest mother fucker I ever did see  
  
Hell he was even more punk than me  
He should've been on the cover  
He should've been on the cover  
He should've been on the cover of Punk and Disorderly Volume II

It's funny how nothing seems much fun  
Anymore to me now that I quit the drink  
'Cause soberness, it might be what I need  
But it's certainly not how I want to be  
  
Nothing seems much fun anymore to me  
  
Consequence never had anytime to think  
About what coulda, shoulda, happen to me  
see-Common sense my parents said I  
Never had any, but now look whose  
Got the dough  
  
No longer born to lose  
Put away my party shoes  
Missin' the alcohol  
Don't feel like goin' out  
Nothing worth singin' about  
Missin' the alcohol  
Without tonic n gin  
Without no vicodin  
  
Nothing seems much fun anymore to me [Repeat: x4]

Never fell in love  
Until I fell in love with you  
Never know what a good time was until I had a good time with you  
If you want to get the feeling and you want to get it right  
Then the music gotta be loud  
For when the music hit I feel no pain at all  
  
Warm summer night I was drinking with my dad  
He tried to give me the love that I never had  
But he gave more love to his bottle of wine  
So I had to go out and find love of another kind  
  
Here it is  
Here I am  
Turn it up  
Fucking loud  
  
Radio, Radio, Radio  
  
When I got the music  
I got a place to go  
  
Radio clash  
Magnificent 7  
I was a choir boy  
You showed me no heaven  
Two tools surely lost  
No remorse ignoring the cost  
  
Here it is  
Here I am  
Turn it up  
Fucking loud  
  
Radio, Radio, Radio  
  
When I got the music  
I got a place to go

First they put away the dealers, keep our kids safe and off the street  
Then they put away the prostitutes, keep married men cloistered at home  
Then they shooed away the bums then they beat and bashed the queers  
Turned away asylum seekers, fed us suspicions and fears  
We didn't raise our voice, we didn't make a fuss  
It's funny there was no one left to notice when they came for us  
  
Looks like witches are in season, you better fly your flag and be aware  
Of anyone who might fit the description, diversity is now our biggest fear  
Now with our conversations tapped and our differences exposed  
How ya supposed to love your neighbor, with our minds and curtains closed  
We used to worry bout Big Brother, now we got a big father and an even bigger
mother  
  
And you still believe this aristocracy gives a fuck about you  
They put the mock, in democracy and you swallowed every hook  
The sad truth is you would rather follow the school into the net  
Cause swimming alone at sea is not the kind of freedom that you actually want  
So go back to your crib and suck on a tit go bask in the warmth of your diaper  
You're sitting in shit and piss while sucking a huge pacifier a country of
adult infants  
A legion of mental midgets a country of adult infants a country of adult
infants  
All re-gaining their unconsciousness

Wasting your life on the sidewalk,  
When you can be out on the street, dodging cars,  
As they go by, the wind goes right through you.  
  
Life on the edge of a razor,  
Never knowing when you're to fall,  
Sure as hell beats never gambling at all.  
  
Life's too short to just barely exist,  
Wide spread mediocracy,  
Will suck you up, resist,  
Another number on a list.  
  
I don't want it, you can have it,  
You can try, but you won't make me,  
Feel the things you feel,  
I'll take my chances, 'til I find a better deal,  
I'll take my chances, along with all the rest.  
  
The snail goes over the razor blade,  
The suicide squad of lemmings parade,  
To their kingdom, where they've made reservations.  
  
I have no reservation,  
And I don't think my seat's been saved,  
I'll take my chances, here, right.

Gigin alone at the bottom of the hill  
Our protagonist named Bill  
Sets his sights on an anchor steam pint  
All he needs is thirteen quarters  
Congregated in his hat  
  
A crow, a scavenger type  
California redemption provides him with his rent  
Room and board inside a fifth of comfort  
  
As the wind penetrates his bones  
His mind keeps focused  
Tidal waves of sound catapulted  
From his horn wail like lovers  
  
The coins don't drop consistent as does the mercury  
His meter slows realizing a zenith  
He's reached perfection  
No one did see him die

Let's go!  
  
It's three o'clock at the Triple Rock  
Another round of watching batty talk  
  
It's where you wanna get snowed in when you can  
Snowing outside it's ten below  
  
Is it day or night we don't care or know  
What we know is we don't want to be anywhere but here  
  
Please don't make us leave  
When in Minnesota and you've got a drinking quota  
  
I'm seeing double at the triple rock  
We're still here watching batty talk  
  
Then undress and get out the top 10  
The One question still remains  
  
How much more oran(??) can we take  
I'll let you know when the medication wears off  
  
I'm a religious drunk  
And this is where I pray  
  
We're a church of alcoholics  
Can't bring up the congregation  
  
Give us air to breathe through carbonation  
We are at the good church and your feltching on bar stools  
  
We're praying that the tabs will keep the holy water flowing  
He keeps a communion and a long night of confessions  
  
Coming home after noon seems to raise a lot of questions  
When in Minnesota and you've got a drinking quota

A blackened wick is what remains  
The flame was blown out just recently  
Although the candle hadn't burned down to the stick  
It won't be lit again, the day won't be so bright  
  
We don't know what she may have been  
All we know is what she left behind  
An apartment cluttered with children's toys,  
Photos of good times  
  
In the bedroom, there's sheets on the windows  
There's a four poster bed for a reason  
There's a box on the floor full of secrets  
It won't be opened  
  
Here older boys and girls would play  
All inhibitions were left behind  
As the door would close, her face begin to shine  
This was her finest hour, this was her finest time  
  
Now, she's gone, and it's not gonna be alright, not for me  
  
She's gone but not forgotten, she's still here  
In all those years she touched so many lives  
Who's gonna watch the little girl she left behind?  
  
Carol Anne stands alone in the school yard  
All the other children have gone  
After waiting for hours,  
She can't understand why her mother left her  
  
In the darkness she sees definition  
In the silence, she hears someone calling  
After nightmares, she lies in bed screaming  
But there's no one listening, there's no one  
Now, she's gone, and it's never gonna be alright not for me she's gone

Ah, never thought it could happen to me,  
But it did, now look at me,  
I'm alone, standing in my cell,  
Staring at the wall, living in hell.  
  
All of my life I never said when,  
I did it again and again,  
Breaking, smashing, and stealing  
I never knew when to quit.  
  
I turned 18, I should've stopped,  
Thought I'd never get caught,  
But I did, I got caught,  
Now I feel pretty stupid  
Fuck!  
  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks by the dozen,  
I'm shitting bricks  
I'm shitting bricks  
  
Mom's rules  
Why can't I do what I want  
Why must I do what my parents want?  
  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules  
I gotta live by mom's rules yeah!

In the morning I awake  
I feel my bladder about to break  
I scratch my balls I rub my eyes  
Just feeling lousy  
  
My girlfriend tells me that  
It's time to take a bath  
I say "No, not today, it's only Tuesday"  
  
Once every 24 hours  
I'm supposed to take a shower  
That's not the way I do it  
Do it do it  
  
Personal hygiene is the last thing on my mind  
I don't want to do it  
Do it do it  
  
It doesn't make a difference to me  
Everyday I do the same old thing  
So why should I have to be clean?  
  
Those dreaded Wednesdays and Saturdays  
Also known as shower days  
I hate them

I play pool 'cause I'm no fool  
I play pool 'cause I'm cool  
I play pool after school  
I play pool all the time  
Cue in my left hand, beer in right  
I shout and drink all through the night  
That sloppy English does me just right  
I use that sloppy English all the time  
I hold my stick like I hold my dick  
Hustling beers from wetto that's the trick  
I use that sloppy English all the time  

Sometimes I feel my life is going 'round in circles  
Beneath my eyes are bluish black  
There's nothing new, no one I want to talk to  
Nothing I want to think about, I got soul doubt  
  
I stick my head out of the window, it's closed  
Instead of air, I get glass stuck into my head  
The city's sounding I can't seem to stop the pounding  
Can't keep my thoughts from flying 'round  
Can't keep my thoughts from flying 'round  
Not sure what I'm thinking about, I got soul doubt  
  
A shameless display, wearing a smile full of pain  
A frameless Erte, a painting without a signature  
She's waiting for someone to save her  
As I pass her by I see Cinderella  
  
She doesn't fit into a slipper  
Like she fits in a bottle of liquor  
There's no one to take her away  
  
Her eyes meet mine, she sees right through me  
The question is asked, Whatcha' gonna do for me?  
I don't want nothin', just a connection  
I gotta know what she's all about  
Cause I know she's been there -  
Soul doubt  
  
I stick me head outside the window once again  
This time I see a thousand faces all too clear  
They wear the same expression, I've seen in my face  
So many times, I know exactly how they feel  
I know exactly how they feel  
I know just what they think about  
They've got soul doubt

When the night has come  
And the land is dark,  
And the moon is the only light we'll see.  
Well I won't be afraid,  
No, I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you stand  
Stand by me.  
So darling, darling stand by me  
Won't You stand by me  
Just as long as you stand, Stand by me.  
When the sky that we look upon tumble and falls  
And the mountains crumble to the sea  
I won't cry, I won't cry  
No I won't shed a tear,  
Just as long as you stand  
Stand by me.  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand Won't You Stand Stand By Me  
When the night has come  
And the land is dark,  
And the moon is the only light we'll see.  
I won't cry, No I won't cry  
No I won't shed a tear,  
Just as long as you fuckin' Stand by me.  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand Won't You Stand Stand By Me  
When the sky that we look upon crumble and falls  
And the mountains tumble to the sea  
I won't cry, No I won't cry  
No, I won't be afraid  
Just as long as you fuckin' Stand by me.  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me  
Do it Fletcher!! Wow!!  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me  
Darling, darling stand by me  
Oh Won't You stand by me  
Oh Won't You Stand, Won't You Stand, Stand By Me  
Hey Hey, Hey Hey, Hey Hey, Hey Hey, Hey Hey, Hey Hey, Hey Hey Hey Hey!!!

She once told me not to listen,  
Find the answers, intuition,  
Follow no one, trust your instincts,  
Face the world, find out it stinks.  
  
Don't come crying,  
Don't come crying,  
Don't come cry to me.  
I'm not your friend,  
I'm just your lover,  
Don't put your faith,  
Don't put your faith in me,  
You cut me up and rob me blind,  
But now I'm fine.  
  
She told me about the places I could never find,  
She told me how to walk while by her side,  
Don't be fooled by teardrops,  
They're worth a thousand lies,  
When I saw them running down her face,  
I believed in her.  
  
Stranded  
Stranded  
  
Hit me in the gut,  
Like a brick through a window,  
Left me in the gutter like a wet news rag,  
Sitting alone, thinking about the times we never had,  
'Cause you were my life.  
  
She told me if and whether,  
We'd spend the night together,  
She made so many promises,  
I believed in her
