Out of my sight  
But the vision is still the same  
Out of my mind  
But the memory remains unchanged  
Stones thrown in anger hold twice the hurt  
Return to sender could only make things worse  
.  
Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart  
'Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life  
.  
Don't ask me why  
Why I've lived with this all alone  
Locked up inside  
And it's cutting me to the bone  
Love is a stranger avoiding me  
Beware of danger's the only sign I see  
.  
Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart  
Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life  
.  
Are you listening  
Is there something that you'd like to say  
Am I getting through  
Are you just gonna leave me this way  
Yeah  
.  
Girl, you've got to break these chains around my heart  
Before it tears me in two  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
That's all I'm asking of you  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
'Cause I've been lonely too long  
You've got to break these chains around my heart  
So I can finally get on with my life

All these posers keep you awake  
I guess I'm just too tired to sleep  
And God only knows I'm too lost to cry  
Kissing last has kept me true  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
Cause I'm so lonely  
  
He hates so much it's love he says  
Inside his dark I need to smile  
He shouts so loud I never hear  
That's why the truths always abused  
  
As I slip into unconsciousness  
I never felt so much to blame  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
As I slip into unconsciousness  
I never felt so much to blame  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (hold me tight)  
But I'll leave (hold me tight)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (another day another night)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely  
  
I'll fall (another day another night)  
So hold me tight  
'Cause I'm so lonely

Drive by my house late at night  
You can see from the freeway above  
No silhouette, but a light left on  
Burning there for love  
smoke is rising from the fire  
Coming out my back door  
I'm inside, sound asleep  
Cigarette on the floor  
Burning there for love  
well I can still remember  
A couple of years ago  
When the smoke and flame called my name  
It was a burning house of love  
that rusty nail over our front door  
Is where I hung our tears in the rain  
I threw that horseshoe into the weeds  
To see what luck can bring  
cause you're in your bed, I'm in mine  
On either side of town  
I think I might take a ride  
And burn your love house down  
Like a burning house of love  
  

Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
It's five and I'm driving home again  
It's hard to believe that it's my last time  
The man on the wireless cries again  
It's over, it's over  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
It's late and I'm with my love alone  
We drink to forget the coming storm  
We love to the sound of our favourite song  
Over and over  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Living out a memory of a love that died  
  
It's time and we're in each other's arms  
It's time but I don't think we really care  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
Dancing with tears in my eyes  
Weeping for the memory of a life gone by  
  
Dancing with tears in my eyes

Well, the clock says it's time to close now  
I guess I'd better go now  
I'd really like to stay here all night  
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes  
Street lights share their hollow glow  
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise  
Still one place to go  
Still one place to go  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves  
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets  
Speak in secret alphabets, I light another cigarette  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves  
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets  
Speak in secret alphabets, I light another cigarette  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander, baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves
