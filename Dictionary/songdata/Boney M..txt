On the first day of spring  
They heard the news  
The word spread like fire  
That she had fallen  
The fields of that day  
Were watered with tears  
Tears that were cried  
For chica da silva

The prime of her life  
Fought for her country  
Became a spy  
And men told the secrets  
Once looked in her eyes  
They laid in the arms  
Of chica da silva  
The game that she played  
Couldn't last very long  
Luck she relied on  
When they had all gone  
Her hands tied together  
Back on the wall  
They shot the life  
From chica da silva

We are children of paradise  
When the Lord created us  
All his work was through  
  
Then the children of paradise  
Did the only thing they really shouldn't do  
  
Children of paradise  
We started out there  
Full of innocence in our eyes  
And without a care  
  
We are children of paradise  
We knew of no crime  
Until one of the meanest lies  
Has changed our time  
  
It was long ago  
In the early morning glow  
When it all began with Adam and Eve  
They were young and free  
And for all eternity  
They were meant to feel  
No trouble no grief  
  
Children of paradise  
  
We're the children of paradise  
In search of the light  
  
That was put in paradise  
And started the night  
  
It was long ago  
  
We are children of paradise  
  
We are the children of paradise  
Who didn't obey  
When we followed the wrong advise  
We wandered astray  
We are the children of paradise  
In search of the light  
  
It was long ago

When darkness is falling and shadows grow long  
It's time for the children to sing this old song  
It tells of the coming of wonders untold  
Forgotten is winter, its fury and cold  
  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
  
When darkness is falling and shadows grow long  
It's time for the children to sing this old song  
It tells of the coming of wonders untold  
Forgotten is winter, its fury and cold  
  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
When darkness is falling and stars fill the sleigh  
The waiting is over and we all know why  
It's time for celebrating and having a feast  
  
Because of the tidings that come from the east  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow  
Hi-ho, hi-ho, we'll soon see the candles glow

I was walkin' down the street  
Concentratin' on truckin' right  
I heard a dark voice beside of me  
And I looked 'round in a state of fright  
I saw four faces one mad a brother from the gutter  
They looked me up and down a bit and turned to each other  
  
(I say) I don't like cricket, a oh no I love it, a yeah  
I don't like cricket-a no no I love it-a yeah  
  
Don't you walk through my words you got to show some respect  
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you ain't heard me out yet  
  
Well he looked down at my silver chain  
He said "I'll give you one dollar"  
I said "you've got to be joking man  
It was a present from me mother"  
He said "I like it I wan' it I'll take it off your hands  
An' you'll be sorry you'd crossed me  
You'd better understand that you're a long, a long way from home"  
  
(And I say) I don't like reggae, a no no I love it, a hey  
I don't like reggae, a yeah yeah I love it-a oh yeah  
  
Don't you cramp me style don't you queer me pitch  
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you  
Ain't heard me out yet  
  
I hurried back to the swimming pool  
Sinkin' pina colada  
I heard a dark voice beside me say  
"would you like something hotter"  
She said "I've got it you wan' it my harvest is the best  
And if you try it you'll like it and wallow in the  
Dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday, dreadlock holiday"  
  
(And I say) don't like jamaica oh no I love her hey  
Don't like jamaica oh no I love her oh yeh  
  
Don't you walk through my words you got to show some respect  
Don't you walk through my words 'cause you ain't heard me out yet

Never know how much I love you  
Never know how much I care  
When you put your arms around me  
I get a fever, that's so hard to bear  
  
You give me fever, when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever, in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Sun lights up the daytime  
Moon lights up the night  
I light up when you call my name  
And I know I'm gonna treat you right  
  
You give me fever, when you kiss me  
Fever when you hold me tight  
Fever, in the morning  
Fever all through the night  
  
Everybody gots the fever [should be "everybody's got..."]  
That is something you all know  
Fever isn't such a new thing  
Fever started long ago  
  
Romeo loved Juliet  
Juliet, she felt the same  
When he put his arms around her  
He said "Julie baby, you're my flame"  
  
Thou givest fever, when he kisseth  
Fever with thy flaming youth  
Fever, I'm a fire  
Fever, yeah I burn for thou  
  
Captain Smith and Pocahontas  
Had a very very mad affair  
When her daddy tried to kill him  
She said, "daddy, oh, don't you dare!"  
  
You give me fever [should be "he gives me fever"]  
With his kisses  
Fever when he holds me tight  
Fever, I'm his misses  
Daddy, won't you treat him right?  
  
Now you've listened to my story  
Here's a point that I have made  
Chicks were born to give you fever  
Be it fahrenheit or centigrade  
  
They give you fever, when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live, you learn  
Fever, 'till you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
  
They give you fever, when you kiss them  
Fever, if you live and learn  
Fever, 'til you sizzle  
What a lovely way to burn  
  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn (they give you fever)  
What a lovely way to burn  
What a lovely way to burn

I know a place we all can go  
Don't wanna live here anymore  
I see a planet slowly die  
And I get tired of wondering why  
Come and join the right future world  
Don't you wanna be free and alive  
Come and join the right future world  
To a world where we all can survive  
Get on board and fly with me  
To the future world (future world)  
To let our children grow up there in peace  
We can live in harmony  
In another world (another world)  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
Get on board and fly with me  
To the future world (future world)  
We can build a better world up there  
Love is not just make-believe  
In another world (another world)  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
Don't waste the precious life away  
The spaceship's taking off today  
Leave your belongings all behind  
Everything you need is in your mind  
Get on board and fly with me  
To the future world (future world)  
We can build a better world up there  
Love is not just make-believe  
In another world (another world)  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away  
10.000 light years away...

You come home late at night  
You tell me it's all right  
But something must be wrong  
I want to hold you close  
But your reaction shows  
You keep me hanging on  
I'm tired of all your lies  
Your silly alibies  
Don't want to play that game  
If you don't know the rules  
I'll send you back to school  
You put a man to shame  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
I know i'm not the only one, only one  
Maybe you're the lonely one, lonely one  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
'cause i know you bring me down, bring me down  
The lover of my life  
What happened to our plans  
We've got a one night stand  
You'd better let it be  
If there's another man  
I'll do the best i can  
To bring you back to me  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
I know i'm not the only one, only one  
Maybe you're the lonely one, lonely one  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
'cause i know you bring me down, bring me down  
The lover of my life  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop

Maybe you're the lonely one, lonely one  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop  
'cause i know you bring me down, bring me down  
The lover of my life  
Give it up, give it up  
I just want to make it stop, make it stop

Someone told me long ago  
They were gone before the storm  
I know, it's been coming for sometime  
Be it so, and so I say  
Little rain and sun by day  
I know, shining down like water  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
Coming down, down this day  
Coming down, down this day  
Yes for days and days before  
So there's is rain and cold is hot  
I know, in this place got all my found  
Through the circles fast and slow  
There for every moment goes  
I know, I can't stop, I wonder  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
Coming down, down this day  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
I wanna know, have you ever seen the rain  
Coming down, down this day  

Don't you ever feel sad  
Lean on me when the times are bad  
When the day comes  
And you are down  
  
In a bit of trouble  
And you bite the ground  
Just hold on, I'm coming  
  
Hold on, I'm coming  
Hold on, I'm coming  
Hold on, I'm coming

If you get cold I'll be your cover  
Don't have to worry, cause I'm here  
You don't have to suffer, baby  
  
'Cause I'm here

Down the ocean a ship comes sailing through the waves  
Filled with hundreds of men they take as slaves  
Just long for their true homeland africa  
And to be saved they want to be free  
Men women and babyslaves  
Coming to the land of liberty, liberty  
Ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi ship ahoi...  
  
They are tired of waiting for a brand new day  
Some of them sing and chant some of them pray  
And some men got a little tired too  
No one knows if the journey pay  
  
Men women and babyslaves  
Coming to the land of liberty, liberty

A day or two ago, I thought I'd take a ride  
And soon Miss Fanny Bright  
Was seated at my side  
The horse was lean and lank  
Misfortune seemed his lot  
he got into and drifted back, and we we've got upset  
  
Jingle bells, Jingle bells, Jingle all the way.  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one-horse open sleigh.

Music is a mirror  
Near around my soul  
Music is the spirit  
Come on let it roll  
Music is my nature  
People have you heard  
Music is my future  
Music is the world  
Let it all be music  
People sing a song  
Let it all be music  
Let us sing it on and on and on  
Let's play the music  
My kind of music  
Let's play the music  
Play it on and on and on and on  
Music isn't somewhere  
Music turns you right  
Music is a fever  
Leads you day and night  
Music is like heaven  
Where you wanna be  
Music is religion  
Music set's you free  
Let it all be music  
People sing a song  
Let it all be music  
Let us sing it on and on and on  
Let's play the music  
My kind of music  
Let's play the music  
Play it on and on and on and on

You and I were finished  
I was through with you  
Splitting up forever  
Seemed the thing to do  
I said I can't stand you  
With your honey touch  
This time you were cheating me  
One time too much  
Just then I remembered  
That a friend I knew  
Told me one thing  
I should never do  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark  
What you're getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high  
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why  
Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance  
And don't fall for someone else's song and dance  
Sure there was this guy  
Right next to me  
Mine just for the asking  
He said he would be  
But to leave my man  
Seemed to me all too strange  
And I'd say that I'm glad  
I didn't make the change  
Now our life is almost  
Like a Paradise  
Let me pass on to you  
This advice  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers in the middle of the night  
You may feel a strong temptation, the vibrations may be right  
But who knows what's gonna happen, you may simply lose your cool  
When you find it, you'll find out you were a fool  
Never never change your lovers under any midnight spell  
Take it easy, slow and easy, everything will turn out well  
Let the sunshine of a new day, and don't move while you're uptight  
Changing lovers in the middle of the night  
Never never change your lovers in the middle of the night  
Everything may look so different in the early morning light  
Never never be too hasty when you're groping in the dark  
What you're getting into may be just a lark  
Keep your cool and don't change lovers when you're feeling sorta high  
Sorta big and high and mighty without really knowing why  
Let your heat wear off a little, give your man another chance  
And don't fall for someone else's song and dance

He was black and handsome  
And mighty mighty brave  
Comin' from the backwoods  
The grandson of a slave  
He was caught for something  
They knew he'd never done  
And he was diggin' ditches  
Out in the burnin' sun  
  
[Chorus]  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
Working on the chain gang-No More  
No more, no more, no more  
  
Man he was a giant  
And iron he could bend  
And he swore he'd fight them  
Down to the bitter end  
Though he was no talker  
His burnin' eyes would say  
You may keep on tryin'  
Can't hold me no way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And one night he lay in waiting  
Hit the guard and took the key  
And before the others caught him  
He jumped out and he was free  
He jumped out and he was free  
  
He made for the swamp lands  
It seemed a hopeless duel  
They had dogs and shotguns  
And they were mighty cruel  
But they couldn't find him  
He was too smart and strong  
Hiding' in the daytime  
Wandering all night long  
  
Working on the chain gang-No More [Repeat: x6]

No time to lose  
My man is coming in today  
No time to lose  
I know he must be on his way  
No time to lose  
I want to look just right for him  
No time to lose  
Tonight will be the night for him  
My man is big and strong  
And not the shyest one  
When he gets hold of me  
We're having lots of fun  
There's no denying  
He sends me flying  
He does so much for me  
Yessirre  
Yessirre  
Got the touch for me  
No time to lose  
My man is clear and free again  
No time to lose  
And so it's him and me again  
No time to lose  
I'm gonna do the dressing up  
No time to lose  
So he can do the messin' up  
He won't be knocking  
He'll come on rocking  
Though he'll be reall' wild  
He such a honey child  
There's no denyin'  
He sends me flyin'  
He does so much for me  
Yessirre  
Yessirre  
Got the touch for me  
No time to lose  
I got myself a winner now  
No time to lose  
No longer he's a sinner now  
No time to lose  
There'll be some heavy lovin' soon  
No time to lose  
It's almost like an honeymoon  
No time to lose...

Oh my Lord  
You sent your son to save us  
Oh my Lord  
Your very self you gave us  
Oh my Lord  
That sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more  
  
Oh my Lord  
When in the crib they found him  
Oh my Lord  
A golden halo crowned him  
Oh my Lord  
They gathered all around him  
To see him and adore  
  
(This day will live forever)  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
They had become to doubt you  
Oh my Lord (He is the truth forever)  
What did they know about you  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
But they were lost without you  
They needed you so bad (His light is shining on us)  
  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
With the child's adoration  
Oh my lord (He is a personation)  
There came great jubilation  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
And full of admiration  
They realized what they had (until the sun falls from the sky)  
  
Oh my Lord (Oh praise the Lord)  
You sent your son to save us  
Oh my Lord (This day will live forever)  
Your very self you gave us  
Oh my Lord (So praise the Lord)  
That sin may not enslave us  
And love may reign once more

They rode in the morning  
Casablanca to the west

In the dry winds of summer  
They were sharpening the blades.  
They were riding to act upon the promise we had made.

With the rifle and the lance  
We will suffer no intrusion from the Infidels of France.

For the future of this land on the ride to Agadir.  
Ride, ride, ride, ride to Agadir.  
Though they were waiting  
And they were fifty to our ten  
They were easily outnumbered by a smaller force of men.  
As the darkness was falling  
They were soon to realize  
We were going to relieve them of their God-Forsaken lives.

Gonna' hold you tight and lift you to the top

Press the trigger in you go  
And you better never want to' make it stop

Sounds so pretty  
If they bit is feeding human touch  
Sample city

Apparently it turns you too whatever it does so much  
Your feeling like a clown

All the finest songs are hidden in a chip  
With the funny noise around  
Is it music is it sound  
So you travel on a psychedelic trip  
(repeat the middle verus twice)

Meet me on the moon very very soon  
Meet me on the stars Jupiter and Mars  
Fly me to a star  
Burning out in space shining on my face  
  
Fly me through the night on your Silver Wings  
Over crystal seas Valleys of the Kings  
By the lilac shore where the dragon flies  
In the diamond skies  
  
Silly Silly Confusion  
And tangle of wild illusion  
We're living in a wonder world of fantasy  
We spent all our times in sweet living dreams  
  
It's a Silly Silly Confusion  
Like a flower of wild profusion  
You can do the things in life  
You always wanted to  
Within your heart you know it always will come through  
  
Take me for a ride in your Dream-Machine  
To a time and place where no one has been  
Let me look upon worlds I've never seen  
In your Dream-Machine  
  
Fly me to a star burning out in space  
Let me feel the light shining on my face  
Sail on solar winds sail on silver birds  
Through the universe  
  
Silly Silly Confusion  
It's a Silly Silly Confusion  
  
Silly Silly Confusion  
It's a Silly Silly Confusion  
  
Silly Silly Confusion

Time, changer of seasons, time will see another flower growing.  
Climb over the mountains, there you'll find warm winds blowing.  
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind.  
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find.  
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world.  
I cannot believe it, everywhere I see lonely faces.  
Why have we no answers, just some more empty places?  
Somewhere in the world there is peace of mind.  
Somewhere in the world that's what I must find.  
Somewhere in the world there's a place for me in this world.

See the stars come joining down from the sky  
Gently passing they kiss your tears when you cry  
See the wind the summer blow your hair upon your head  
See the rain, the falling rain, it's great  
Still I'm sad  
  
All my sounds my tears just fall into days  
They are driving the night will find they are lost  
Now I found the wind is blowing time into my heart  
When the wind blows hard we are apart  
Still I'm sad  
  
See the stars come joining down from the sky

Still I'm sad  
Oh heart, I'm sad  
Still I'm sad  
Oh heart, I'm sad

To think I found you really love me  
Look what love can bring

Sunny, yesterday my life was filled with rain.

The dark days are gone, and the bright days are here,  
My Sunny one shines so sincere.

Proud in the morning sun  
Day has just begun  
She's a queen riding on the waves  
So many miles away  
Sailing many a day  
Brave in dark storms and hurricanes  
Bringing something for everyone  
"..." of lands underneath the sun  
Here comes the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
Here comes the Alibama, sailing homewards to you and to me  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Here comes the Alibama-ma  
Sailing the seven seas  
Like a bird on the breeze  
Oh how she travelled far and wide  
Now she is nearly at home  
Not much longer alone  
Coming back on the morning tide  
Bringing something for everyone  
"..." of lands underneath the sun  
Here comes the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
Here comes the Alibama, sailing homewards to you and to me  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea  
The Alibama, the Alibama, the Alibama from over the sea

I tried so very hard not to cry  
I kept hanging around to forget all the good things  
We both used to do  
(Time to remember the nights without you)  
  
No, no, no one can take your place, how I love  
I miss your embrace, I'm a prisoner of love  
Waiting for you it's true  
(Time to remember, I'm lost without you)  
Time to remember the nights without you)  
  
Oh, let's get it together, I know that you'll soon understand  
We're wasting time 'cause love's hard to find  
Oh, how could we both be so blind? Oh, babe  
  
I've been losing control, I've been told  
But I, I must touch your soul  
If I go out with you, I don't mind if I do  
(Time to remember I'm lost without you)

Two of us riding nowhere  
Spending someones  
Hard earned pay  
You and me Sunday driving  
Not arriving on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
  
Two of us sending postcards  
Writing letters on my wall  
You and me burning matches  
Lifting latches on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
  
You and I have memories  
Longer than the road  
That stretches out of here  
  
Two of us wearing raincoats  
Standing solo in the sun  
You and me chasing paper  
Getting nowhere on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
  
You and I have memories

Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Black night, right time  
It's all about, it's voodoonight  
Can't you feel it  
Strangers surround the voodoospell  
But you saw them close your mind  
Don't listen  
'cause big zombie makes a night of it  
We're all here and break the spell  
Don't follow him  
Big zombie seeks a bride tonight  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight  
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Whispers, potions, puppet with needles  
Witchcraft, magic  
Odd songs to hear, it's voodoonight  
Does it haunt you  
The fatefull wish of voodoospell  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight  
Voodoonight

I see mushrooms, atomic mushrooms.  
I see rockets, missiles in the sky.  
Day by day, more and more,  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
Poor world, poor world.  
  
Concrete's rising up,  
Where yearerday was park  
You heard the robin's song  
Heavy tractor runs  
Where air was clean and cool  
Make money, bringing fuel.  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
A poor world, poor world.  
  
Fishes doomed to die  
As people live close by  
And oaktree falls with moon  
Parking lots will come  
With flowerfields were bright  
As junkyard covers sight!  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
Poor world, is hurting bad,  
Poor world, is doomed to die.  
  
We kill the world  
Kill the world  
We surely do  
In peace we do!  
We kill the world  
Kill the world  
'cause we don't know  
What we are doing!  
  
We kill it  
One by one  
Don't realize!  
  
And nuclear piles stand like monuments  
Of destruction throughout over the country  
  
Promenades must go  
So cars can drive in row  
New fact'ry towers tall  
Farmhouse had to fall  
No flowers in the air  
Pollution everywhere.  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
A poor world, poor world.  
  
Oceans in despair  
There's rubbish everywhere  
The seaweed chokes in mud  
Nature's had her lot  
With nuclear waste and rot  
And mushrooms bloom as clouds.  
  
Where will this lead to  
And what is this good for?  
Poor world, is hurting bad,  
Poor world, is doomed to die.  
  
We kill the world...  
  
Don't kill the world  
Don't let her down.  
Do not destroy basic ground.  
Don't kill the world  
Our means of life.  
Lend ear to nature's cry.  
  
Don't kill the world  
She's all we have,  
And surely is worth to save.  
Don't let her die,  
Fight for her trees,  
Pollution robs air to breathe.  
  
Don't kill the world  
Help her survive  
And she'll reward you with life  
And don't just talk,  
Go on and do the one, who wins is you.  
  
Cherish the world,  
A present from god  
On behalf of all creatures,  
Made by the lord  
Care for the earth,  
Foundation of life  
Slow progress down help her survive

A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny star lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You've got the feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two no-one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
  
And all of this happened  
Because the world is waiting  
Waiting for one child  
Black, white, yellow, no one knows  
But a child that would grow up and turn tears to laughter  
Hate to love, war to peace  
And everyone to everyone's neighbour  
Misery and suffering would be forgotten forever  
  
It's all a dream and illusion now  
It must come true, sometimes soon somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born

I'm looking out the window pane  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
But you're not here  
Where did you go  
  
I want to know what made you go away  
What went wrong?  
I'm looking out my window pane  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
  
There's no-one here to laugh with me  
To make the dark clouds disappear  
My love, what went wrong?  
Where did you go - there is no answer  
  
I need you now much more that ever  
Where did you go - why can't you be with me  
Where did you go - we were so tender  
Where did you go - why not surrender  
  
Only you can set me free  
I'm looking out my window pane (Oh yes)  
And I hear the sound of pouring rain  
I think of you, of someone who can  
  
Always count on love so true  
And I'm here - where are you?  
Tell me...  
I think of you, of someone who can  
  
Always count on love so true  
And I'm here - where are you?  
Where did you go - there is no answer  
I need you now much more that ever  
  
Where did you go - why can't you be with me  
Where did you go - we were so tender  
Where did you go - why not surrender  
Only you can set me free  
  
Where did you go - there is no answer  
I need you now much more that ever  
  
Where did you go - why can't you be with me  
Where did you go - we were so tender  
Where did you go - why not surrender  
Only you can set me free

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas,  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten and children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow
