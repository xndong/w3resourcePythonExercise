  
ABSOLUTE ZERO  
Can we begin at the end?  
To Save Some time  
Bags and our War Planes are Gathered  
The Clock is ticking you have no authority  
Float like a dead man down the river  
And there are no streets in this air.....  
Etcetera is my worst enemy  
Its wrong and I know  
And I will go  
To the Big Hand of the God Damned  
The Middle Ground is Absolute Zero  
What Can be found at Absolute Zero?  
Can We Begin at the end?  
To Save some time  
Etcetera is my worst enemy  
Its wrong and I know  
And I will go  
To the big hand of the God Damned  
The Big Hand of the Small Man  
The Middle Gorund is Absolute Zero  
What can be found at Absolute Zero?  
A Happy End is Absolute Zero  
Nobody Wins at absolute Zero......  
What's That?  
Nothing  
What's That?  
Nothing  
Nothing  
Nothing  

ABSOLUTE ZERO  
(Lyrics from the Japanese KFADFFAL)  
Can we being at the end to save some time?  
Dead center  
Point blank  
Together  
The clock is ticking  
You have no authority here  
Float like a dead man down the river  
And there are no streets in this city  
Et cetera is my worst enemy  
It's low and I know it all will go  
To the big hand of the god damned  
You're here  
Red dot  
And now you know where not to go  
The middle ground is absolute zero  
What can be found at absolute zero  
Can we begin at the end to save some time?  
Et cetera is my worst enemy  
It's low and I know it all will go  
To the big hand of the god damned  
The big hand of the bald man  
The middle ground is absolute zero  
What can be found at absolute zero  
A happy end is absolute zero  
Nobody wins an absolute zero  
Worse than nothing  
Nothing...

"HEY!" WHAT?? "Oh nothing, just wondering why it is you're doing  
that whatever it is you're doing. "Oh yeah, why?" I dunno it just  
doesn't seem like something you'd be doing that's all you of all  
people, know what I mean? "Yeah I know it's been bugging you since the  
day I was born, huh? I asked my friend Anne about it. I said, 'Anne,  
Anne, Anne, what am I supposed to do, it's been bugging them since the  
day that I was born.' She said 'Do whatever the hell you want to do!  
Now is the time to do whatever you want, and it will still turn out  
great. You've got the world at your feet.'"  
I never claimed to be different, I only said I was bored and she's  
tired of your uniqueness, it sends her over head first then the rest  
of her follows, the breath of life, it never left her hollow...  
I can do everything, she said, she said with a smile.  
And I can go anywhere tonight, cause I'm with Anne.  
Anne, Anne, Who? Anne Dagnabit Island princess queen with the juice  
What's this? I see she brought her whole uplown contingent. First there's  
Jon E., he always loves a party, he's followed by Vinnie, who's feelin'  
kinda skinny, he says "Hey Anne I'm starved what you got to eat, she  
says "Vinnie you're always starving man get away from that fridge!  
Here comes Lucy, she's feelin' really sexy, she's followed by her  
boyfriend, who'd better not turn around, this time, or he's bound to lose  
her, and here comes Jamilla, who's got the cream soda...  
I can do everything, she said, she said with a smile  
And I can go anywhere tonight, cause I'm with Anne

Has it been so long?  
Do you think we know?  
Do you think we care?  
Die, for the here and now  
Do you remember why?  
Do you remember how?  
  
Face, out  
Stick your chest, out  
Stomach, in  
That's right  
  
Do you really know  
Where the harems go  
In the desert snow? Hail,  
An oasis dream doesn't really seem  
To mean a thing when you're out, cold  
  
So, hands, up  
Put your guards, up  
Feet, down  
Up, down  
Forward, march  
Left, right  
Cold, cold  
I feel cold

One day you're thinking that maybe you're feeling better  
And you're probably an OK person, if only you had a job...  
Through the hollow tombs can see them  
Through their mouths I can hear them praying for pain  
But it's only a game  
  
Listen, man, I know  
That things are really rough  
And everybody gets you  
And life is really tough  
But I know that deep down inside  
There's a feeling that rides  
All the way to the end  
  
Thursday you sit in your room with the lights turned out  
And you don't answer the door  
Friday morning looks sunny and bright  
Like it's going to be a good day  
And it would be if only you had a job  
  
Time is on your side, you're young  
Don't waste your time today

I want them to know it's me  
It's on my head  
I'll point the finger at me  
It's on my head  
  
Give it all to you, then I'll be closer  
  
Smilin with the mouth of the ocean  
And I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
I'll see you  
  
I will let you shout no more  
It's on my head  
I'll pick you up from the floor  
It's on my head  
I'll let you even the score  
It's on my head  
  
Give it all to you, then I'll be closer  
  
Smilin with the mouth of the ocean  
And I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
I'll see you  
  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer closer  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer closer  
  
Smiling with the mouth of the ocean  
And I'll wave to you with the arms of the mountain  
  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer closer  
Give the same to me then I'll be closer

I started this  
It's all for me  
What's yours is mine and mine is mine  
That's plain to see  
So give it up  
I've got to have  
I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow  
Be aggressive  
Be-e aggressive  
Be-e-a-g-g-are-e-s-s-I-v-e  
What someone else  
Would leave behind  
And spit it out, let go to waste  
I claim as mine  
You're my flavour of the week  
I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow  
Tall and reckless  
Ugly seed  
Reach down my throat  
You filthy bird  
That's all I need  
The empty pit  
I've got to feed  
To prove I'm fit  
A healthy man  
I've got to be  
Malnutrition, my submission  
You're the master and I take it on my knees  
Ejaculation  
Tribulation  
I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow, I swalllow  
Be aggressive  
Be-e aggressive  
Be-e-a-g-g-are-e-s-s-I-v-e  
Go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, go, fight, win

It doesn't really matter, the things you say to me  
Cause if I had a ladder, up there is where I'd be  
Outta here where the air is cold, you're messing with my mind  
Hey! You do it every time, Hey! And the season comes around  
Once more, once more.  
It doesn't really matter, the things you try to say  
It doesn't really matter, you say 'em every day  
Right now just give me more blood  
Just give it to me deep red  
A flowing river crimson  
A flowing river burning with desire  
It's great, but I never said how great  
Hey, you never really asked, well, I'm asking you right now  
So shut up and explain  
What's on your mind  
In this dark hour  
I said it doesn't matter, I can't be that much fatter  
And you'll never get as much blood  
From a phony Blarney, stone, rock, hard, Granite!?! Solid.

Pour shame all over us  
Harden into a crust  
Cement  
Forget the glamor and  
Mumble a jackhammer  
Under your breath  
Hide your face in the curtains  
Better unsaid, so close  
And it rolls off the tongue  
Almost!  
The world expects the pose  
Perfectly natural  
Loosen up  
Smearing wet concrete  
And swearing you'll never be  
Caught  
At your weakest, etched in stone  
And we're frozen here, peeking  
Almost, sweet talk, caffeine  
Make contact  
Up to my neck  
I confess in quicksand  
"But it's so easy for you"  
"There's always one thing"  
"Do you have something to tell me?"  
"Say something"  
"Anything"  
I'm warning you  
I'm warning you  
I'm fucking you  
I'm warning you  
"Relax"  
"It's just a phase"  
"You'll grow out of it"  
Believe anything anyone ever tells you  
It's not funny anymore  
It's thing you hate the most  
The thing you hate the most  
The thing you hate ALMOST

Candle light, it burns in every hole of your eyes  
It's beautiful, how much you'll never realize  
So hush my love, there's something I'm to tell you now  
Your time has come, around again my sleepless one  
Your friend was young, hung and plastered  
He never knew his own disaster  
I think it's good, in fact it was faster  
Cause it was you that he was after  
Hold me now, as if you'll never let me go  
Unhand me now, as if you've always known my name  
His love was king, his love was master  
He needed more, he needed always  
He searched in vein for love and shelter  
In every soul, in every hallway  
So you thought she'd be sweeter than your girlfriend Peter  
Well give it a second chance cause you've yet to meet her  
We got the same ideas, we got the same old fears  
They're different colors sometimes, but, hey, who cares?  
Just years that tears our lives apart  
Just like the time that you tried to teach your cousin to walk  
He couldn't do it-push!-you told him twice  
Well, I do man but it just don't jive  
Tried so hard to control my behavior  
I tried so hard, so hard to believe you  
But now I live only to deceive you  
So KICK and SCREAM!!!

Sink the eight ball  
Buy the lady a drink  
And nobody knows my name  
Bodies float up  
From the bottom of the river  
Like bubbles in fine champagne  
He's the one, no doubt  
Walkin' on a tightrope  
He's the one, no doubt  
Got a gash on my head  
And a grin on my face  
And a shadow called danger  
Hidin' in the sheets  
And on the streets  
In the heart of every stranger  
Here he comes, look out  
Teach the world a lesson  
Here he comes, look out  
Sweat on the brow  
And a tap on the phone  
And lives are on the line  
Pick up the briefcase  
On a high speed chase  
Breathin' by the roll of the dice  
Reachin' up to the top  
We're dependin' on you  
Reachin' up to the top  
"In regards to  
My usage of the drug  
It modified my personality  
To the extent that I was  
Highly irritable"  
"I was like a crack Hitler"  
Keep up the fight  
And in the wink of an eye  
Never give up  
Ooh ahh  
Look out

It's cold and it's  
Smooth and it's  
A hard shade of white  
And everybody needs to lick the surface clean  
But it never tastes better  
  
White blossoms to red and freezes white again  
Close it before something crawls in  
Commit it, leave it, get away - we always  
Drop our good side  
  
Being good gets you stuff  
Being stuff gets you good  
Good stuff gets you being  
And wheelin' and dealin' and squeelin'  
Shit lives forever  
  
They have no legs, but chase us anyway  
Wipe the shadow of your best friend  
Gave birth to something we don't want to be  
We drop our good side  
  
You can't kill it  
  
Eat is just as deep as you can fuck it  
So cough it up or go down  
And there's only one thing that separates  
A man  
  
Shit lives forever  
  
We'll retire with a turd on our lips  
Under a pair of knowing eyes  
I'm gonna take a few down with me  
And drop my good side  
You can't kill it  
  
Take it from our drummer, "Puff"  
Being good it gets you stuff

Wir trafen dann  
Zum??? Schtzenfest  
Fr mich sieht sie aus  
Wie Heinos Schwester  
  
Schwarzbraun ist die Haselnu,  
Schwarzgebrunt ist war ihr Haar  
  
Oh mein??????? Mdchen, tage?????????  
Leg dich auch hin, wir scheien??? Eben nicht mit dem  
Das Schtzenfest, niemals mehr gesehen.  
  
Wir machen Liebe  
I'm Schweinetrog  
Meine Hosen platzen  
Auf mein Dudelschwanz  
  
Sie dachte ich war ein?????  
Ihre??? Waren wie Eisbein  
  
Oh mein??????? Mdchen, tage?????????  
Leg dich auch hin, wir scheen??? Eben nicht mit dem  
Das Schtzenfest, niemals mehr gesehen.  
  
Oh Klingel..... Ja Ja... Hund! .... Hund weg!....  
Hund weg, Arschloch... Hund weg!

Sie tanzt???? Und Schuheplattler  
Achselhhle war frisch und duften wie  
Super  
  
Oh Mdchen, ????? Ihren bh  
Wochenende, Scheie aber nicht mit der  
Das Schtzenfest niemals mehr gesehen  
Niemals mehr gesehen.

It would be wrong to ask you why  
Because I know what goes inside  
Is only half of what comes out  
Isn't that what it's about ?  
To remind us we're alive  
To remind us we're not blind  
In that big, black hole  
Comfortable  
Digging the grave, I got it made  
Let something in, or throw something out ?  
You left the door open wide  
I know you have a reason why  
That knot is better left untied  
I just went and undid mine  
It takes some time  
And the shadows so big  
It takes the sun out of the day  
And the feeling goes away  
If you close the door  
Comfortable

I know it sounds funny but I just can't stand the pain  
Girl I'm leaving you tomorrow  
Seems to me girl you know I've done all I can  
You see I begged, stole, and I borrowed  
Yeah...Ooo  
  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
I'm easy like Sunday morning  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
Easy like Sunday morning  
  
I wanna be high  
So high  
I wanna be free to know the things I do are right  
I wanna be free  
Just me  
Oh babe...  
Ooh!  
  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
I'm easy like Sunday morning  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
That's why I'm easy  
Aah, aah, aah, aah  
Easy like Sunday morning

Come here, my love  
I'll tell you a secret  
Come closer, now  
I want you to believe it  
I'll tell you all the things  
You want to hear  
Don't worry, baby  
There's nothing to fear  
Hey, little girl  
Would you like some candy?  
Look into my eyes  
I've seen it all  
Hand in hand  
Together we fall  
We'll sing and dance  
And we'll find romance  
And we'll stroll to the edge of the world  
Come sit right down  
Lay your head on my shoulder  
It's not the point  
That I'm forty years older  
You can trust me  
I'm no criminal  
But I'd kill my mother  
To be with you  
We'll sing and dance  
And we'll find romance  
And we'll stroll to the edge of the world  
Give me a smile  
Let me see those pearlies  
I'll do anything  
For the little girlies

Things worked out better than we had planned  
Capital from boy, woman and man  
We were like ink and paper  
Numbers on a calculator  
Knew arithmetic so well  
Working overtime completed what was assigned  
We had to multiply ourselves  
A bouncing little baby  
A shiny copper penny  
And he spent himself  
Would not listen to us  
But when he lost his appetite  
He lost his weight in friends  
Baby became a fat nickel so fast  
Then came puberty  
Exponentially  
Soon our boy became a million  
People loved him so  
And helped him to grow  
Everyone knew the thing that was best  
Of course, he must invest  
A penny won't do  
But he made us proud  
He made us rich  
But how were we to know  
He's counterfeit  
Now everything's ruined

Back and forth, I sway with the wind  
Resolution slips away again  
right through my fingers, back into my heart  
Where it's out of reach and it's in the dark  
Sometimes I think I'm blind  
Or I may just be paralyzed  
Because the plot thickens every day  
And the pieces of my puzzle keep crumblin' away  
But I know, there's a picture beneath  
Indecision clouds my vision  
No one listens  
Because I'm somewhere in between  
My love and my agony  
You see, I'm somewhere in between  
My life is falling to pieces  
Somebody put me together  
Layin' face down on the ground  
My fingers in my ears to block the sounds  
My eyes shut tight to avoid the sight  
Anticipating the end, losing the will to fight  
Droplets of "yes' and "no"  
In an ocean of "maybe"  
From the bottom, it looks like a steep incline  
From the top, another downhill slope of mine  
But I know, the equilibrium's there  
Indicision clouds my vision  
No one listens  
Because I'm somewhere in between  
My love and my agony  
You see, I'm somewhere in between  
My life is falling to pieces  
Somebody put me together

Styling, you know you are styling  
So turn to the mirror and blow yourself a kiss  
It goes just like this  
You've done it a thousand times  
It's as easy as drinking wine, only now it's blood  
Here it come again  
(treating you so kind)  
Till it comes again  
(leaving you no mind)  
Your feelings, they flow without reason  
So look to the stars above and  
Blow it all away  
I come without warning  
Some call me morning,  
I wipe all your tears away, the evil ones I kill  
Here it comes again  
(treating you so kind)  
Till it comes again  
(leaving you no mind)  
Taking the form of pain this time  
It never treats you unkind  
Your followers, lead them blind  
And suck away their lives  
Cause yours depends on it  
Here it comes again  
Chasing the night away

Tossed into my mind, stirring the calm  
You splash me with beauty and pull me down  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance truns to a stare  
Obsession rules me - I'm yours from the start  
I know you see me - Our eyes interlock  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave good-bye...  
Sifting to the bottom, every day for two  
All energy funnels, all becomes you  
You come from out of nowhere  
My glance turns to a stare  
One minute here and one minute there  
Don't know if I'll laugh or cry  
One minute here and one minute there  
And then you wave good-bye...

What if there's no more fun to have?  
And all I got is what I've had?  
What if I have forgotten how?  
Cut my losses and get out now  
Get out, right now!  
  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
A new thing growing in me  
  
It is the hardest thing to  
To watch it grow on top of you  
And see you're just like everyone  
No fun!  
  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
A new thing growing in me  
There's something I don't want to see  
  
I don't speak that language anymore!  
My blood is not that color anymore!  
My blood don't shine the same way anymore!  
I cannot deny it anymore!  
No  
  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
Got a new thing growing in me  
There's something I don't want to see  
There's something stronger than me  
There's something I don't want to see  
A new thing growing in me

Got that feeling  
Luck is just a little of it  
Got that feeling  
I can't stop winning  
  
A to Z  
Look what you're missing, as we speak  
Your number's rising, take a peak  
There's just enough to go around, get a piece  
Your own little piece of hell  
  
Got that feeling  
Loving every minute of it  
Got that feeling  
I can't stop winning  
  
Have a drink  
A pot of coffee, cannot think  
Too many friends here, just an inch  
Between striking out and striking rich, just a risk  
One I'll take and take again  
  
Got that feeling  
Gotta bet a little of it  
Got that feeling  
I can't stop winning  
And start living  
  
You can't borrow tomorrow

Over the hills they came from the valley  
Making innuendos about my lack of talent, oh well  
They say that when I'm supposed to be singing  
All I 'm really doing is yelling, oh well  
To you I say  
  
Break out or get out  
Then they say that I can't sing  
That I don't say a thing  
That I make everything up oh well  
To you I say  
  
Break out or get out  
Break out or get out  
  
Get out of your mind  
Cause it's much too small  
And there's so much going on

Greenfields  
(The Brothers Four)  
Once there were greenfields...kissed by the sun  
Once there were valleys...where rivers used to run  
Once there were blue skies with white clouds high above  
Once they were part of an everlasting hope  
We were the lovers who strolled through greenfields  
Greenfields are gone now...parched by the sun  
Gone from the valleys...where rivers used to run  
Gone with the cold wind that swept through to my heart  
Gone with the lovers who let the dreams depart  
Where are the greenfields where we...used to roam?  
I'll never know what made you run away  
How can I keep searching when dark clouds hide the day?  
I only know there's nothing here for me  
Nothing is now left for me to say  
But I keep on waiting...until you return  
I keep on waiting until the day you learn  
You can't be happy when your heart's on the roam  
You can't be happy until you bring it home  
Home to the greenfields...and bleed once again (?)

The air is warm  
I hear the wind and the trees  
I know I'm there, but I'll never be  
The wind is soft tonight, the tide is low  
And I know the way  
(I never felt better now)  
  
Sometimes life, it moves too slow  
Slows to a crawl, and then the poetry is lost  
And without speed, hope becomes certainty  
And for once I'm certain  
(I never felt better now)  
  
A garden is it's own perfect world  
Where everything has a place  
Every leaf, every stone, every speck of dirt  
But where's my place?  
I even tried to get arrested today  
But everyone looked the other way  
I count the hours, and I count the days  
But for once I'm certain  
  
Don't want your help  
Don't need your help  
Don't want your help  
Don't need your help  
Helpless  
  
You found a way to make me say  
Help me please someone  
  
The water's clear  
I see that it's full of dimes  
For every wish, I wonder why  
Why all I want is something beautiful  
A place to rest  
(I never felt better now)  
HELP

Sky is clear tonight  
Sky is clear tomorrow  
A star is out  
I reach for one to sparkle in my hand  
A star is out  
I will not touch you, I am just a man  
  
Sky is clear tonight  
Sky is clear tomorrow  
  
And every night I shut my eyes  
So I don't have to see the light  
Shining so bright  
I'll dream about a cloudy sky, a cloudy sky  
  
"Man was born to love  
Though often he has sought  
Like Icarus, to fly too high.  
And far too lonely than he ought  
To kiss the sum of east and west  
And hold the world at his behest  
To hold the terrible power  
To whom only gods are blessed  
But me, I am just a man"  
  
And every night I shut my eyes  
So I don't have to see the light  
Shining so bright  
I'll dream about a cloudy sky, a cloudy sky  
  
And every night I shut my eyes  
But now I've got them open wide  
You've fallen into my hands  
And now you're burning me  
You're burning me

It is not a good day, if you are not looking good  
This is the best party that I've ever been to  
Today I asked for a god to pour some wine in my eyes  
Today I asked for someone to shake some salt on my life  
Look!  
Everything's spinning  
(We're on the ground)  
Never cheer before you know who's winning  
(Don't make a sound)  
  
Sniff the glass and let it roll around on your tongue  
Let me introduce you to someone before the party is done  
Someone to look to in need or in want or in war  
If you give him everything, he may give you even more  
  
This is the best party I've ever been to  
  
Don't let me die with that silly look in my eyes

You have a winning way, so keep it  
Your future  
You are an angel heading for a land of sunshine  
And fortune us smiling upon you  
  
Prepare for a series of comfortable miracles  
From fasting to feasting  
And life to you is a dashing, bold adventure  
So sing and rejoice  
  
And look for the dream that keeps coming back  
Your future  
Pat yourself on the back and give yourself a handshake  
'Cause everything is not yet lost...  
  
(Does life seem worthwhile to you?)  
HERE'S HOW TO ORDER!  
Does life seem worthwhile to you?  
Do others push you around?  
  
Is age against you?  
Sing and rejoice!  
Does life seem worthwhile to you?  
Does emotional music  
  
Have quite an effect on you?  
I-I can help - I can help you - I can help you help yourself!  
HERE'S HOW TO ORDER!

The landlord's here to visit  
They're blasting disco down below  
says, "I'm doubling the rent  
'cause the buildings condemned  
You're gonna help me buy City Hall"  
  
But we can, you know we can  
We can, you know we can  
Let's lynch the landlord man  
  
I tell them turn on the water  
I tell them turn on the heat  
Tells me "All you ever do is complain"  
Then they search the place when I'm not here  
  
But we can, you know we can  
Let's lynch the landlord  
Let's lynch the landlord  
Let's lynch the landlord man  
  
There's rats chewin' up the kitchen  
Roaches up to my knees  
Turn the oven on, it smells like Dachau  
Til' the rain pours through the ceiling  
  
But we can, you know we can  
Let's lynch the landlord man

The crowd roars  
It's deep and so unhealthy  
The rest you know  
I'll feel the hands that felt me  
  
Cold hands  
Your hands  
Cover my mouth  
While I'm staring into bright lights  
  
Applause  
The crowd roars  
The rest you know  
Ten lovers violating  
  
Cured  
Discharged  
Reach back inside  
Knuckle white  
  
Ruffle white  
The crowd roars  
They ruined and repaired me  
The rest you know  
  
The hands removed the bad thing  
Miracle

Go on and wring my neck  
Like when a rag gets wet  
A little discipline  
For my pet genius  
  
My head is like a lettuce  
Go on and dig your thumbs in  
I cannot stop giving  
I'm thirty-something  
  
Sense of security  
Like pockets jingling  
Midlife crisis  
Suck ingenuity  
  
Down through the family tree  
You're perfect, yes, it's true  
But without me you're only you  
Your menstruating heart  
  
It ain't bleedin' enough for two  
It's a midlife crisis...  
What an inheritance  
The salt and the Kleenex  
  
Morbid self attention  
Bending my pinky back  
A little discipline  
A donor by habit  
  
A little discipline  
Rent an opinion  
Sense of security  
Holding blunt instrument  
  
I'm a perfectionist  
And perfect is a skinned knee  
You're perfect, yes, it's true  
But without me you're only you  
  
Your menstruating heart  
It ain't bleeding enough for two  
It's a midlife crisis...

You tied the knot  
A legend is what you bought  
I give you cold water and you  
Swear it was wine  
You bought time  
If you can fool yourself, then why not them?  
Just keep on passing it mouth to mouth to mouth  
  
I can dress up the dead man  
But I can't bring him back to life  
  
You tied the knot  
Peeled your skin off, leaving a bundle of nerves  
I give you a wet noodle, you swear that it was my tongue  
A sharp one  
Instead of that same old mouth to mouth to mouth to mouth  
  
I can dress up the dead man  
But I can't bring him back to life

A glow in her eye  
As he waved goodbye  
That's where it all began  
She was a loving girl  
He was a caring guy  
Together they had plans  
They were married and had a baby  
His name was Johnnie  
  
Wait a minute, that's me  
Why am I only three years old again  
Spinning and spinning and spinning  
  
There was no gleam in your eye  
When you passed us by  
In the parade this time  
You had nothing to say  
And you're always on your way somewhere  
But today you just stood still  
You were a quiet kind of person  
Who asked for nothing and got just that  
So they sent you away to kill for your country  
  
Could you blame him?  
Could you blame them?  
No. And in the end  
When we meet again we're friends  
Will we ever learn that we are always God's children  
And gods never made moral decisions  
They made love

You squirt out red and turn so yellow  
And then you made me kill my own  
I'm not afraid  
(Coming, coming)  
But I'm afraid  
  
Blood in your eyes again  
Bravery, the face of man  
Blood on your mind again  
Chivalry, the face of man  
Blood in your lies  
Enemy, the face of man  
Blood in your eyes, again  
  
Is this the only path of glory? If so then I won't go alone  
Follow the trail  
(Running) Follow the trail  
  
I'm not afraid  
But I'm afraid

All of that thick time without you  
Has made me so thick and drunk  
"and it's ok to laugh about it"  
I said, "it's ok to laugh about it"  
  
Runnin' twice as fast to stay in the same place  
Don't catch my breath until the end of the day  
And I'd rather be sot in the face  
Than hear what you're going to say  
  
One day the wind will come up  
And you'll come up empty again  
And who'll be laughing then?  
You'll come up empty again  
  
No reason no explanation so play the violins  
  
It's always funny until someone gets hurt  
And then it's just hilarious!  
  
You beat me every time you blink  
if only I did not have to think  
Think about you crackin' a smile  
Think about you all the while  
  
On the ricochet it's going to hit you  
It's always funny until someone gets hurt  
You can laugh at me when it misses you

Backside melts into the sofa  
My world, my TV, and my food  
Besides listening to my belly gurgle  
Ain't much else to do  
  
Yeah, I sweat a lot  
Pants fall down every time I bend over  
And my feet itch  
Yeah - I married a scarecrow  
  
I hate you  
Talkin' to myself  
Everybody's starin' at me  
I'm only bleedin'  
  
Someone taps me on the shoulder every 5 minutes  
Nobody speaks English anymore  
Would anyone tell me if I was gettin' stupider?  
I hate you  
  
Talkin' to myself  
You don't feel it after awhile  
You take the beating  
I'm a swingin' guy  
  
Throw a belt over the shower curtain rod  
And swing - - -  
Toss me inside a hefty  
And put me in the ground  
  
A drink needs me  
I don't  
I ain't about to guzzle no tears  
So kiss my ass  
  
Newscasters, cockroaches, and desserts  
I hate you  
Talkin' to myself  
Everybody's starin' at me  
  
I'm only bleedin'  
where are the kids?

I think it's time I had a talk with my kids  
I'll just tell 'em what my daddy told me  
YOU AIN'T NEVER GONNA AMOUNT TO NOTHIN'

I'm here alone on the telephone line  
I'm right where you want me to be  
And I'll wait alone and never ask why  
I'll be where you want me to be  
  
And I know  
I've been here before and I know your kind  
You're right where I want you to be  
Now I'll say what I think  
I'll never be what you want me to be  
(Just to be who I am)  
What do you want me to be?  
  
You'll be on your knees  
  
Tell me  
Tell me it's not true

Drought makes the workers dream  
Muscles and fields of green  
Shovel the last few crumbs  
Of generosity  
Open hearts, open mind, open mouth, open vein  
Drain  
Someday the rains will come  
My blistered hands tell me  
Tomorrow, tomorrow, tomorrow  
Bite  
Bite  
Bite  
Cry  
I'll keep coming back  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Squash me  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Under the charity  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Under the topsoil  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Under the fingernail  
Smaller and smaller and smaller  
Then small becomes all becomes all  
Bite  
Bite  
Bite  
Cry  
It's not a mirage  
It's not a mirage  
Trickling downward, trickling downward  
It's not a mirage  
Drain  
Drain  
Bite  
Bite  
Bite  
Cry  
Smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller and smaller

Something for the girl with everything  
See, the writings on the wall  
You bought the girl a wall  
Complete with matching ball-point pen  
  
You can breathe another day  
Secure in knowing she won't break you (yet)  
Something for the girl with everything  
Have another sweet my dear  
  
Don't try to talk my dear  
Your tiny little mouth is full  
Here's a flavour you ain't tried  
You shouldn't try to talk, your mouth is full  
  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Bearing gifts to aid amnesia  
  
She knows everything  
Yes yes everyting  
She knew way back when you weren't yourself  
Something for the girl with everything  
  
Here's a really preatty car  
I hope it takes you far  
I hope it takes you fast and far  
Wow, the engines really loud  
  
Nobodys gonna hear a thing you say  
Something for the girl with everything  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
  
Where should they leave these imported gimmicks  
Leave them anywhere  
An-an-anywhere  
Make sure that there's a clear path to the door  
  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
Something for the girl with everything  
  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
Three wise men are here  
  
Here's a patridge in a tree,  
A gardener for the tree  
Complete with ornithologist  
Careful, careful with that crate  
  
You wouldn't want to dent Sinatra, no  
Something for the girl who has got everything,  
Yes, yes, everything  
Hey, come out and say hello  
  
Before you friends all go  
But say no more than just hello  
Ah, the little girl is shy  
You see of late she's been quite speechless,  
  
Very speechless  
She's got everything

Surprise! you're dead!  
Ha ha! open your eyes  
See the world as it used to be when you used to be in it  
When you were alive and wen you were in love  
And when I took it from you!  
It's not over yet  
You don't remember?  
I won't let you forget  
The hatred I bestowed  
Upon your neck with a fatal blow  
From my teeth and my tongue  
I've drank and swallowed, but it's just begun  
Now you are mine  
I'll keep killing you until the end of time  
Surprise! you're dead!  
Guess what?  
It never ends  
The pain, the torment and torture, profanity  
Nausea, suffering, perversion, calamity  
You can't get away

'and after all the feelings go, I see I still love you so,  
I just thought I'd let you know now that everything's okay,  
And you are on your way back, back to where you came,'  
She said with pain in her heart, it was there from the start.  
Now I know why everything turns grey, but it's our own world we paint  
And I want the brightest, I want flourescence every day and night  
For the rest of my life, open your eyes, won't you?  
Can't you see you're so beautiful to me?  
Don't look back as a matter of fact there's  
A ten foot jack wants to break your back  
You stole his girl, you wrecked his world  
Now it's your your head that he's gonna twirl  
He won't think once, he won't think twice  
Cause he knows just what he's gonna do tonight  
He will commit a crime, a crime of love  
And he won't be happy till he sees your blood  
Looking back on when you left me  
Standing in the rain  
Don't look back as a matter of fact there's  
A son of a bitch and he's digging a ditch  
For you my friend, my lucky one  
So grab your things it's time to run to the other side  
Where love takes pride, and your souls  
The only thing that stays alive  
Ma maooba goo goo ga ga  
Hey! quit talkin that terminal jive!  
Looking back on when I left you...  
Crying in pain  
Don't look back...[1st verse]  
Looking back on when you left me  
Standing in the rain, in-credible pain  
I understand. you have to be your own person. and that's ok with me.  
Hurts, hurts, hurts, like a like a motherfucher  
Love. it hurts. it kills. like a sonofabitch.  
That feeling. it gets me. down inside. deep down there  
No further. keep going. oh man that's right out my system  

I jerk every night, after midnight,  
it takes quite a while but i cum.  
Its great when your jerking around like that  
so lets all jerk off tonight!  
  
now maim and destroy,  
every girl every boy,  
decamate, violate, desecrate,  
exterminate, obliviate, demolish... kill!  
  
i have big hairy nut sacks,  
floating in the sea of spring x3  
  
i watch my left nut,  
bigger then the right,  
saggin low,  
jerking slow.  
  
Now i speak to walls of woe,  
ask them now, maybe they know,  
what was asked the day before,  
when we started this romance,  
you looked at me, and i at you and you said:  
YOU GUYS MAKE ME DANCE!  
  
So suck my juice, right out of my ass,  
lick the inside clean,  
let me eat shit fried with vinigerate sauce,  
and let me sleeze your spleen.  
  
Gui has a small one!

Well, just follow your heart  
Man oh man  
Try and see, if you can  
Ha Ha  
  
Jungle sounds great  
Lots of scary noise  
Don't deter us from our journey onward  
  
Hey man, let your spirit go  
To the full extent of the meaning  
  
He said, "And follow me to the deepest part of the jungle.  
Where it is always dark and wet and warm  
To the sacred part."  
  
Well, just follow your heart  
Man oh man  
Try and see, if you can  
Ha Ha  
  
Jungle sounds great  
Lots of scary noises  
Don't deter us from our journey onward  
  
We pushed and followed  
Only our deepest, hidden senses, senses  
And exposed to the elements  
That lie within

Where it grows on trees  
But never blooms  
Where it hurts the least for whoever  
Saw it first  
First to go and the last to know  
Lasts longer than a lifetime  
Takes the least amount of effort  
Feels better than a bargain  
Just to know it's there So I don't have to see the light  
Can't you see  
There's only one me  
And that me is me  
I know where but I cannot share  
You'll call me, I'll stand in line till then  
I'll be waiting  
Can't you see  
All circuits are busy  
Please try back again

Girl listens to mom  
So she lights a match and pretends to sleep  
While everything burns  
Man drives nowhere  
So he pressed the pedal, hit a few dogs  
And felt good  
Boy hears teacher's words  
So he closed his eyes and stepped in front  
Of a train  
Woo!  
Woops!  
Sorry 'bout that  
It's just an accident  
Revenge  
Nobody forgets  
Chop it into bits  
The bitterness is hard to hide  
It smells like homicide  
Just nod and say it's O.K.  
I can hear your voice echo  
O.K. I lied-it's really the voice  
Of the guy who kicked your head in  
Look in the mirror  
It seems you're drinking, miniature  
And soon enough your gone  
Woops!  
Sorry 'bout that  
It's just an accident  
Revenge  
Nobody forgets  
Chop it into bits  
The bitterness is hard to hide  
It smells like homicide  
Just nod and say it's O.K.  
No one saw the perfect crime  
I can't wait for the next time  
The bitterness is hard to hide  
It smells like homicide  
Just nod and say it's O.K.  
You try to make the moment  
Last you sold it right in half  
You die and have a nice day  
Woops!  
Sorry 'bout that  
It's just an accident

I know the feeling  
It is the real thing  
The essence of the truth  
The perfect moment  
That golden moment  
I know you feel it too  
I know the feeling  
It is the real thing  
You can't refuse the embrace  
It's like the pattern below the skin  
You gotta reach out and pull it all in  
And you feel like you're too close  
So you swallow another dose  
The pinnacle of happiness  
Filling up your soul  
You don't think you can take any more  
You never want to let go  
To touch the roots of experience  
The most basic ingredients  
Toi see the unseen glitter of life  
And feel the dirt, grief, anger and strife  
Cherish the certainty of now  
It kills you a bit at a time  
cradle the inspiration  
It will leave you writhing on the floor...  
This is so unreal, what I feel  
This nourishment, life is bent  
Into a shape I can hold  
A twist of fate, all my own  
Just grit your teeth, make no sound  
Take a step away and look around  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
The whisper is but a shout  
That's what it is all about  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the sacred song that someone sings through you  
Like the flesh so warm that the thorn sticks into  
Like the dream one day you know will come to life  
Try to hold on just a little longer, stronger  
It's the jewel of victory  
The chasm of misery  
And once you have bitten the core  
You will always know the flavor  
The split second of divinity  
You drink up the sky  
All of heaven is in your arms  
You know the reason why  
It's right there, all by itself  
And what you are, there is nothing else  
You're growing a life within a life  
The lips of wonder kiss you inside  
And when it's over the feeling remains  
It all comes down to this  
The smoke clears, I see what it is  
That made me feel this way  
This is so unreal, what I feel  
Flood, sell your soul, feel the blood  
Pump through your veins, can't explain  
The element that's everything  
Just clench your fist and close your eyes  
Look deep inside, hypnotize  
Yes, the ecstasy, you can pray  
You will never let it slip away  
Like the echoes of your childhood laughter, ever after  
Like the first time love urged you to take guidance, in silence  
Like your heartbeat when you realize you're dying, but you're trying  
Like the way you cry for a happy ending, ending  
I know

Keep your distance  
You're in the race [?]  
Caress me  
In your eye I've got better things to do This will hurt someone White walls,
windows  
Charity(?)  
Defenders(?)  
Comfort me and bring me something sharp This will hurt someone - someone else  
This will hurt someone else Calm down, Think Carefully  
Seen it all before  
Mind your own fucking business  
Seen it all before  
What I would give for your eyes  
Seen it all before  
You'd never blink again  
Seen it all before Faces on top of more faces  
This bullet in your chest, the world is yours  
Each word, you suck it through a straw  
It's so predictable, it's policy This will hurt someone - someone else

They say this guy's,  
This guy's in love with you  
Yes, I'm in love  
Who looks at you the way I do?  
When you smile, I can tell  
We know each other very well  
  
How can, I show you?  
That, I got to know you  
  
'Cause I've heard some talk  
They say you think I'm fine, yeah  
Yes, I'm in love, I'm in love baby  
And what I'ld do to make you mine  
Tell me now, is it so?  
  
My hands are shaking  
Don't let my heart keep breaking, 'cause  
  
I need your love  
I want your love  
Say you're in love  
In love, with this guy  
If not, I'll just sigh  
  
Tell me now,  
Is it so?  
Don't le me be  
The last to know  
  
My hands are shaking  
Don't let my heart keep breaking, 'cause  
  
I need your love  
I want your love  
Say you're in love  
In love, with this guy  
If not, I'll just sigh

Zoo time is she and you time  
The mammals are your favourire type, and you want her tonight  
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat  
You hear the thunder of stampeding rhinos, elephants and tacky tigers  
This town ain't big enough for both of us  
And it ain't me who's gonna leave  
Flying domestic flying  
And when the stewardess is near do not show any fear  
Heartbeat increasing heartbeat  
You are a khaki-coloured bombadier it's Hiroshima that you're nearing  
This town ain't big enough for both uf us  
And it ain't me who's gonna leave  
Daily, exept for Sunday  
You dawdle in to the cafe where you meet her each day  
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat  
As twenty cannibals have hold of you, they nead their protein just like you do  
This town ain't big enough for both uf us  
And it ain't me who's gonna leave  
Shower, another shower  
You've got to look your best for her and be clean everywhere  
Heartbeat, increasing heartbeat  
The rain is pouring on the foreign town, the bullets cannot cut you down  
This town ain't big enough for both of us  
And it ain't me who's gonna leave  
Census, the latest census  
There'll be more girls who live in town though not enough to go ground  
Hearbeat, increasing heartbeat  
You know that :  
This town isn't big enough,  
Not big enough for both of us  
This town isn't big enough,  
Not big enough for both of us  
And I ain't gonna leave

Looking down into the water  
It's hard to make your face  
If our love is drowning, then why  
Do I feel so out of place?  
Bubbling up to the surface  
Are you getting a breath of fresh air?  
Forever longing to make you mine  
But I can't escape your stare...  
Liquid seeps into your lungs  
But your eyes look so serene  
It's wonderful how the surface ripples  
But you're perfect, and I cannot breathe  
Forever longing to make you mine  
But I can't escape your stare  
Hold me closer, keep me near  
I'll never get enough  
Touch me from below  
I'll never let you go  
But I can't escape

Generals gathered in their masses  
Just like witches at black masses  
Evil minds that plot destruction  
Sorcerers of death's construction  
In the fields the bodies burning  
As the war machine keeps turning  
Death and hatred to mankind  
poisoning their brainwashed minds  
Oh Lord yeah  
  
Politicians hide themselves away  
They only started the war  
Why should they go out to fight  
They leave that all to the poor  
  
Time will tell on their power minds  
Making war just for fun  
Treating people just like pawns in chess  
Wait 'till their judgment day comes  
  
Now in darkness world stops turning  
As the war machine keeps burning  
No more war pigs have the power  
Hand of God has struck the hour  
Day of judgment God is calling  
On their knees, the war pigs crawling  
Begging mercy for their sins  
Satan laughing spreads his wings  
Oh Lord yeah

A piece of mail  
A letterhead  
A piece of hair  
From a human head  
  
They're stayin' to me  
"I should've killed it"  
"I should've killed it"  
"I should've killed it before"  
  
You're right, you're right  
"Kill the body and the head will die"  
They're laughin' at me  
"I should've learned it"  
"I should've learned it"  
"I should've learned it before"  
  
What a day, what a day  
If you can look it in the face  
And hold your vomit  
  
A wet sneeze and a "no left turn"  
A row of teeth and an encouraging word  
Beneath a mile of skin  
"I should've noticed it"  
"I should've noticed it"  
"I should've noticed it before"  
  
What a day  
What a day  
What a day  
Don't you touch it

Why hold on?  
Your hands are getting sore  
You must be scared of something  
From the time before, well...  
We're here again  
How long, who knows?  
It's not your right to tell me  
Where this trip will go  
Pull away  
You're dying today  
You could enjoy it  
If you could take your feelings with you  
But put your mind on me  
And suck my energy  
And see the speed gets higher  
I see you hold on tighter....  
  
But just fatigue  
Is all your face will show  
It's weary from the stress  
Getting delirious  
"I didn't want this race  
We can't keep up this pace"  
We don't want to get well  
We want to go to hell  
We want an urban dream  
The fucking urban scream  
"This time was mine to borrow  
I'll pay for it tomorrow"  
You'll pay for it today  
And as we drive away  
I'll make my pleasure greater  
Push the accelerator  
  
(and down we go)
