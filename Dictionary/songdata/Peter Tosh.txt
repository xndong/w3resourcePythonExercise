You cannot move I at all  
Son of Jacob  
Cannot move me at all  
I am the son of Moses  
You can't move I at all  
I am the son of David  
You cannot move I at all  
  
I am a firm ripe diamond  
You cannot move I at all  
You could a shed more tears  
You cannot move I at all  
  
You could a full of evil  
You cannot move I at all  
You could a try more nuttin'  
You cannot move I at all  
  
And you can try make a something  
That can't move I at all  
And could a come with ism

Leave My Business (P. Tosh) (Honorary Citizen album)  
Wake up one morning and don't have no tea  
Me no want no one come sorry for me  
That's nobodys business but my own  
The other day comes and it happens the same  
Don't think that I'm going to feel ashamed  
That's nobodys business but my own  
So you better leave my business, leave my business  
Leave my business and mind your own  
If I get high and fly like bird  
You should never say a word  
That's nobodys business but my own  
And if you drink rum and tumble down  
You alone go and have your fun  
That's nobodys business but your own  
When landlord come collecting rent  
Me not come beg you fifty cent  
That's nobodys business but my own  
And if he says that I'm to move  
That wont stop me from improve  
That's nobodys business but my own  
Leave my business, leave my business  
Leave my business and mind your own

To guide and teach my fellow man  
But one thing I can't overstand  
Is why them don't love his brother man  
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat  
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat  
Sometimes I sit and look around  
And listen to the daily sound  
But when I check, there's so much lies  
And that's the reason why the children cry  
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat  
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat  
It's been so long

So the shitstem we got to rearrange  
And if there's obstacles in the road, we got to throw them overboard  
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat  
Oh bumbo klaat, oh ras klaat  
One night, an evil spirit held me down  
I could not make one single sound

Unnu old vampire  
Only like to see blood running  
But true you know it's fire bunnin'  
Unnu set of vampire  
Now unnu fight against upfullness  
Fight against creation  
Fight against everything good for the younger generation  
Unnu old vampire  
Only trod upon creation  
Sucking the blood of the nation  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampire  
Unnu drink up the old wine  
Have no place for the new mind  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu fight against morality  
You fight against integrity  
Fight against everything good for the younger generation  
Unnu old vampire  
Only trod upon creation  
With your bloody meditation  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampire  
Do unnu wickedness at midnight  
And unnu humble when it's daylight  
Unnu set of vampire  
Unnu old vampires  
Unnu grieve their brnk? Lord  
Unnu fire burial  
Unnu hypocrite the world, God  
Unnu old vampire  
Do unnu wickedness every night  
And unnu humble when daylight  
Unnu old...

CHORUS  
We're all in this race  
Everybody trying to keep a pace  
Can't get away  
No no, there is no escape  
The world is faced with problems  
And many illusions  
Love is the man overstanding  
It's the only solution  
CHORUS  
People walking around in disguise  
Try to tell me what they're trying to hide  
'Cause what you're looking for  
It stay here with you all the time  
The world is faced with problems  
And many illusions  
Love is the man overstanding  
It's the only solution  
CHORUS

Why must I cry  
These tears from mine eyes  
Why must I cry  
These tears from mine eyes  
  
Making believe you love me only  
(just to love)was my great sin whoa)  
(just to love)was my great sin whoa)  
(just to love)was my great sin whoa)  
  
But I will never fall in love again  
'cause only my heart feels the pain  
  
Why must I trod  
This lonely, this lonely road  
Why must I carry  
This heavy, this heavy load  
  
Making believe you love me only  
Was my great sin  
Was my great sin  
Was my great sin  
Mm my great sin  
  
I'll never fall in love again  
'cause only my heart feels the pain  
Feels the pain  
Sad pain  
  
I will never fall in love again  
'cause only my heart feels the pain  
Feels the pain  
Why must I cry these tears from mine eyes  
Why must I cry these tears from mine eyes
