[Everlast]  
Once upon a time not long ago  
when people wore pyjamas and lived life slow  
When laws were stern and justice stood  
and people were behaving' like they ought to: good  
There was a little boy who was misled by another lil' boy  
and this is what he said  
"Me and you, Guy, we gonna make some cash  
robbing' old folks and making' the dash"  
They did the job, money came with ease  
but one couldn't stop, it's like he had a disease  
He robbed another and another and a sister and her brother  
Tried to rob a man who was a D.T. undercover  
the cop grabbed his arm, he started acting erratic  
He said, "keep still, boy, no need for static"  
punched him in his belly and he gave him a slap  
But little did he know the lil' boy was strapped  
the kid pulled out a gun  
He said, "Why'd you hit me?"  
the barrel headed straight for the cop's kidney  
The cop got scared, the kid, he starts to figure  
"I'll do years if I pull this trigger"  
So he cold dashed and ran around the block  
cop radios in to another lady cop  
He ran by a tree, there he saw this sister  
a shot for the head, he shot back but he missed her  
Looked 'round good in expectations  
so he decided he'd head for the subway stations  
But she was coming so he made a left  
he was running' top speed till he was outta breath  
Knocked an old man down and swore he killed him  
then he made his move to an abandoned building  
Ran up the stairs up to the top floor  
opened up the door there, guess who he saw  
Dad, the dope fiend shooting' dope  
who don't know the meaning of water nor soap  
He said, "I need bullets, hurry up, run"  
the dope fiend brought back a spanking shotgun  
He went outside but there was cops all over  
So he get into a car, it was a stolen Nova  
Raced up the block doing 83, crashed into a tree near university  
Escaped alive though the car was battered  
He rat-a-tat-tatted and all the cops scattered  
Ran out of bullets but still had static  
grabbed a pregnant lady and pulled out the automatic  
Pointed at her head and he said the gun was full of lead  
He told the cops, "back off or honey here's dead"  
deep in his heart he knew he was wrong  
so he let the lady go and he starts to move on  
sirens sounded, he seemed astounded  
Before long the lil' boy got surrounded  
he dropped the gun, so went the glory  
And this is the way I got to end this story  
he was only nineteen, in a madman's dream  
I saw the cops shoot the kid, I still hear him scream  
this ain't funny so don't you dare laugh  
Just another case 'bout the wrong path  
straight and narrow or your soul gets cast  
Good night!  
  
(Beat box by Rahzel till fade out)

A yes, yes y'all  
It's too fresh y'all  
A little b-boy blue  
You know it's too beucou  
  
I've been from New York to Cali  
Spent two days in the valley  
And I think I'm 'bout to lose my mind  
And if I think 'bout it one more time  
  
I'm a blow my stack  
See ya out the back  
Give me some room that I can breathe in  
Now I'm a start weavin'  
  
Spells like a wizard  
King of the lizard  
My mojo's risin' like my nature should  
Not everybody can relate to hood  
  
But I used to roll with high frequency  
Had a habit of juvenile delinquency  
If y'all could see all the things I did  
When I was a kid, ya might flip ya lid  
  
'Cause when I was the age of one  
My father gave me my very first gun  
When I was the age of two  
I was pullin' out records with the SD Crew  
  
And when I was the age of three  
I had all the maddest fishes swimmin' after me  
And when I was the age of four  
I was bustin' out shows with the rhymes galore  
See  
  
Day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
Day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
(Gun)  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
(Gun)  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come  
  
Yo, all you duns packin'  
Fightin' for ones  
It's time to get these hons  
Start raisin' some sons  
  
Plant your seed in some fertile soil  
And watch me start bubblin'  
Like I'm 'bout to boil  
Like Olive Oil love Popeye  
  
Just won't stoppa, I got to keep rockin'  
Ticks keep tockin', time keeps slippin'  
My mind keeps trippin'  
I'm in the road less traveled, sure got lotta stones  
  
I say day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
I say day to the night  
Night to the day  
Up around where I stay  
We do things this way  
  
You got to watch how you act  
And watch what you say  
'Cause their ain't no stallin'  
When the death come callin'  
  
When the death come callin'  
Watch me break it down  
When the death come callin'  
Watch me break it down  
  
There's a red house yonder  
Just over the hill  
With my name carved  
Into the window sill  
  
I think I'm gonna burn it down  
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down  
That's what me and my old woman used to say  
We used to lie in bed and make love all day  
  
Now I think I'm gonna burn it down  
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down  
Yeah, I think I'm gonna burn it down to the ground  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come  
  
The man that lives by the pistol  
Dies by the smokin' gun  
I think I hear a steam whistle  
Lord, when my train gonna come

And I'm so dirty  
Call me daddy  
You're so sexy  
You can be my bad girl  
If someone hurt you  
And you tried to hide it  
I'll cut you deeper  
'Cause I know you like it  
The pain I got girl  
Can satisfy you  
But I can't love you  
I won't even try to  
And that junkie urge  
Deep down inside you  
Couldn't keep my secret  
But I know you'd like to  
  
Girl you never gon' get love from a heart of stone  
Some of us were just plain meant to be alone  
I'm all out of secrets  
I'm running out of lies  
And I can see the end girl  
When I look into your eyes  
  
And I'm so nasty  
And I'm so greedy  
And I'm so lonesome  
Girl, I'm so needy  
I want to take you  
And make you my girl  
My willing hostage  
My favorite prisoner  
I'll be your owner  
And I'll be your jailer  
I'll be your lover  
Girl, I'll be your savior  
I'll be your alpha  
And your omega  
I'll break your heart girl  
And you'll call me later  
  
Girl you never gon' get love from a heart of stone  
Some of us were just plain meant to be alone  
I'm all out of secrets  
I'm running out of lies  
And I can see the end girl  
When I look into your eyes  
  
And I'm so dirty  
Call me daddy  
You're so sexy  
You can be my bad girl (4x)

[Chorus]  
Ridin' round town, got a pocket full of dough  
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know  
I take it just as fast and as far as it'll go  
Ridin' round town, got a pocket full of dough  
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know  
  
Aiyyo it's hard knock livin' doin' hard luck time  
Tryin' to make a dime still my only crime  
A man died tryin' to circumcise my shine  
Buck your gun kiddo, and I'll buck mine!  
Cash walk the line, police are the swine  
But knowledge is refined by the wise and divine  
And I can break it down for the dumb and the blind  
Unnatural acts, to actual facts  
Like cats that move packs don't never pay tax  
You ain't lie, boy you need to relax  
You leave a five like a junkie leaves tracks  
A habit needs a home like a monkey needs backs  
  
Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'  
The whiskey in the flask and a head full of blow  
You got heaven up above, got hell down below  
Pistol in my lap, got the pedal to the flo'  
Where I'll wind up, even God don't know  
  
I need a hard-headed woman for a cold-hearted man  
Never seen it comin', that's just part of the plan  
Work the hidden hand, walk forbidden land  
Do the best I can once shit hits the fan  
An hour's worth of sand, supply and demand  
Get high as you can, the power of a grand  
Two in the bush is worth one in the hand  
Could cower in the van, or burst into battle  
Back in the saddle, the kid don't rattle  
Don't play me, up the creek with no paddle  
We don't snitch while you bitches just tattle  
Poppin' off at the lip gets you tipped like cattle  
  
Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love  
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of  
I get high as I can fly then I cry like a dove  
Eyes full of hate, got a heart full of love  
And you're the only woman that I ever dreamed of  
  
[Chorus]

Please, please, please don't leave me now girl  
After all I've done for you  
On my knees here, let's work it out woman  
After all that we've been through  
  
I told you that everyone cheats, everyone lies,  
Everyone suffers and everyone cries  
Old people laugh, young people try,  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
Everyone cheats, everyone lies,  
Everyone hustles and everyone strives  
Bad people win, good people die  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
  
Hush your mouth girl  
Settle down woman,  
Cause you don't make no sense  
Make up your mind girl  
Come around now,  
Come down from off that fence  
  
Don't you know everyone cheats, everyone lies,  
Everyone suffers and everyone cries  
Old people laugh, young people try,  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
Everyone cheats, everyone lies,  
Everyone hustles and everyone tries  
Bad people win, good people die  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
  
Watch your temper girl  
Calm your nerves down  
Better watch how you react  
Put your hands down  
Back up off me woman,  
Cause you might get touched back  
  
Everyone cheats, everyone lies,  
Everyone suffers and everyone cries  
Old people laugh and young people try  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes  
Everyone cheats, everyone lies,  
Everyone hustles and everyone strives  
Bad people win, good people die  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes.  
  
When they look in your eye  
When they look in your eyes  
Lovers they know when they look in your eyes

I hear the train a comin'  
It's rolling round the bend  
And I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when,  
I'm stuck in Folsom prison, and time keeps draggin' on  
But that train keeps a rollin' on down to San Anton...  
When I was just a baby my mama told me  
"Son, always be a good boy, don't ever play with guns  
But I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
Now every time I hear that whistle I hang my head and cry...  
  
I bet there's rich folks eating in a fancy dining car  
They're probably drinkin' coffee and smoking big cigars  
Well I know I had it coming, I know I can't be free  
But those people keep a movin'  
And that's what tortures me...  
  
Well if they'd free me from this prison  
If that railroad train was mine  
I bet I'd move just a little further down the line  
Far from Folsom prison, that's where I want to stay  
And I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away...

Look at how she move, look at how she sway  
Standin in her pumps and her lingerie  
Comment allez-vous parlez vous francais  
Don't know how to act, don't know what to say  
Need a genie and a wish in the very worst way  
And this type of ish happens eve-ry-day  
Type love I feel, is so for real  
So gen-uine, and so sublime  
Baby workin and puttin on a show for me  
Standin over me, I smell potpourri  
Take you any place that you wanna go with me  
Just (come talk to me) like Jodeci  
Got a pain in my heart that never goes away  
Baby girl do you really wanna feel it?  
Got a lot at stake, and a promise to make  
And a kiss from your lips could seal it  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there, for you babe  
I'll be the one that you need  
I'll be the man that will love you  
I'll be there, for you babe  
  
Another loose nut, pain in your gut  
Relationship gone down  
In a bottle of booze, you manifest your blues  
Put on your face and hit the town  
Now that skin-tight dress maybe might impress  
The kind of man that you might not like  
First time up with no luck and confusion  
Got you gamblin' with just one strike  
You need more than conversation and introduction calls  
You need someone to catch you when you fall  
And fly like an eagle when you fine  
Cause you on my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at how she sway, look at how she move  
Tryin' to show and prove, don't disturb the groove  
She got - hazel eyes, and hair that's gold  
An amazing heart, and an angel's soul  
She used to be a sinner, but now she's saved  
She's well respected and she's well behaved  
Her fuse is short, her legs are long  
Her temper's mean, her will is strong  
A love so real, a love so deep  
A love so true, it's so hard to keep  
Her center's sweet, her beauty's rare  
When we walk down the street people stop and stare  
She's so damn smart, she's one of a kind  
She's a work of art, she's a priceless wine  
She's a drama queen, she's a friend of mine  
She's every man's dream and she's mine all mine  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus:]  
I think I would, if I could kill the emperor  
Let's stop the war and feed the poor, let's kill the emperor  
Let's stop the lies, the dead can't rise, silence every mother's cries  
I think I would, if I could, kill the emperor  
  
Yo it's like resident evil, the emperor's people don't give a mad fuck about
your life  
They'll fuck your wife and your kids  
They've got people doing bids for being slaves to the dope that they supplying  
Still they keep lying and tell you that it's some cartel  
While they waiting on the heaven they're creating the hell  
They rape the constitution while you wait in your cell  
And for the victors go the spoils and that's oil wells  
Call Orson Welles cause the worlds at war  
And the front line is just outside your front door  
Fuck the New York Times, Fuck CNN  
And politicians that pretend to be the working mans' friend  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Yo the emperor's a liar, the fields are on fire  
Oil prices get higher, times about to expire  
Hurricane Katrina and Asian tsunamis  
Adolescent mommies and high school snipers  
Final days are coming, get ready for trial  
Americans they live in fifty states of denial  
Have a coke and a smile, or some crack in a vile  
You can even buy a pill to keep you hard for a while for these girls gone wild  
In this world at war, it's the same old whores it's the new crusade  
Yo the plan been made, they lied to invade  
I'm on the palace lawn with my live grenade  
  
[Chorus:]

[Everlast]  
SD-50... Soul Assassin collabo... Laugh now motherfucker... HAHAHAHA...  
  
[Chorus 1: x 2 b-Real]  
The only life I know  
Is to guide my soul  
I take one day, step at a time  
To find mine (what)  
As we go  
Through the blinding road  
Inclining  
To find me some mo'  
  
[Chorus 2: Everlast]  
For all the runners and the money makers (make that money)  
For all the real ones and all the fakers (fake bitches)  
For all the stick up kids and life takers (what)  
Laugh now, and cry later (cry later)  
  
[B-Real]  
I laugh at you  
And you expect to see a weakness  
You triflin' bitches in speeches  
You're fucking leaches  
Sponges, soakin' up my energy  
Pretend to a friend of me  
But you stab me in the back  
Cold and vengefully  
When all I did was pick you up  
And put you on  
With the big dons  
To lift you up  
But you fuckin' spit in my face  
And spit venomous words  
Used weapons you heard  
Would damage my whole world  
But you must have mistaken me  
For someone else  
Because I do to your ass  
What you do to yourself  
Look into the mirror nigga  
What's your reflection?  
Are you upset? Full of regret?  
What's your intention?  
You're a lost one  
And now you can't win one  
Where you been  
You taking it all in son  
I see the tears in the eyes of a hater (hater)  
You can cry now but you will not smile later  
  
[Chorus 1] - repeat 2X  
[Chorus 2]  
[Chorus 3: Everlast]  
For all the lovers and all the haters (keep hatin')  
For all the fake ass perpetrators (fake bitches)  
For all the pimps that rock they gators (rock that shit)  
Laugh now, cry later (cry later)  
  
[Everlast]  
They sellin' teen dreams  
On the TV screens  
They got a fund for the gun  
And a ghost in the machine  
They police the crack fiend  
But protect the dealer  
Underpay the teacher  
Overpay the healer  
Rob you with the lawyer  
Fuck you with the handgun  
Throw you in the lineup  
Then arrest the wrong one  
Trial you by jury  
Throw you in prison  
There ain't nothin' to it  
It's just the way they do it  
Unless you got some money  
Cause money makes amends  
And sometimes peoples get murdered for friends  
Sometimes, one times, lose the evidence  
It all depends on how much you spend  
It's the land of the free  
And the home of the gun  
Where they kill for the dollar  
And they worship the son  
Dear god I really hope I ain't the only one  
Laugh now, cry later, when it's said and done  
  
[Chorus 1] - repeat 2X  
[Chorus 2]  
[Chorus 3]  
[Dante Ross]  
Ya, this is one for all those come and go ungrateful punk motherfuckers...  
Ya, this is one to grow on... Soul Assassins style... Deadly assassins...  
all up in your nugget... Ha... You can't fuck with it...  
You just love it... Ha... Fake bitches...

Change your look, cut your hair  
And I pretended like I don't care  
Your so lovely girl, stop crying  
Bite my lip, I close my eyes  
Try to tell myself your no prize  
Can't forget you girl but I'm tryin'  
No one else will ever be  
The things that you are to me girl  
Kind of special hey I ain't lying  
Bite your neck, I pull your hair  
You're so innocent and unaware  
I'm so lonely, I'm so scared girl  
I'm dying here  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt  
  
Grab your shoes, walk out the door  
Like you've done a thousand times before  
But you got nowhere you can go to  
Try to run girl but you can't hide  
All the voices deep down inside  
Repeat all them things that I told you  
You're steadily on my mind  
Girl spoonin' you from behind  
That's my favorite way that I hold you  
For every time I let you down  
For every tear that touched the ground  
For every sincere apology that I owe you girl  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt  
  
I've been loving you a little too long  
And still I keep holding on  
It's been a year since you been gone girl  
Check it out now  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt  
  
Every single time I went and fell in love  
Push came down to shove, I really tried to work it out  
And every single time I couldn't let it go  
Baby girl don't you know your heart was too full of doubt

Sittin' restless under the moonlight  
I know I'm getting ready to kill  
They say we're going in with the day light  
I don't want to but I will  
  
Cause I won't know the man that kills me  
And I don't know these men I kill  
I thank God for my salvation  
Wash away the blood I spill  
  
I try not to think about my family  
Cause it's a little too much to take  
Out here I got me and I got my buddy  
We can't afford even one mistake  
  
I started writing on dirty card boards,  
It's the only paper I could find  
Tell everyone I got their letters,  
Tell everyone I'm doing fine  
  
Late at night when I can dream I,  
I think about life back in the world  
  
I miss you and dad, I miss sister Sarah  
I miss my wife and my baby girl  
  
Pray for me, pray for my soul Ma  
Pray for me and all my sins  
  
They say I got a job to do now  
I'll be back when it finally ends  
  
Do you think I should be fighting?  
Ma, are you proud are you ashamed?  
  
Really I'm trying to do the right thing  
I hope my Government can say the same thing  
  
Cause I won't know the man that kills me  
And I don't know these men I kill  
We all wind upon the same side  
Cause ain't none of us doin' God's Will

Her skin is salty sweet, she wore sandals on her feet  
Side by side we fell asleep in her mother's bed  
She stepped inside of me, she said don't ever lie to me  
This heart of mine can be yours  
Yea that's what she said  
But I just played the role, broke the heart I stole  
Cause I was young and dumb and fucked up in the head  
  
[Chorus ]  
Do you want to be loved for real, do you want to be loved for real  
Do you want to be...loved, (Yes, I want to be loved for real)  
For real, (Do you want to be in love for real)  
(Yes, I want to be in love for real)  
  
Now, I'm down by the river, taking off my shoes  
Jump in the water, wash away these blues  
Now out into the ocean, the current takes hold  
Words already been spoken, tales already been told  
Heart's already been broken, wounds already been healed  
Do you wannabe loved, do you want to  
Do you wannabe love for real.  
  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Her eyes were hazel brown, she laughed the sweetest sound  
And I just loved the way she lit up when she spoke  
She help to ease my pain, she stayed through pouring rain  
And I gave her all that she could take till she broke  
She fit me like a glove, she taught me how to love  
And for some ass I watched it all go up in smoke Chorus (4x)

Maybe you could take a little piece of my pain  
Maybe you could make it all feel the same  
Maybe you could burn this night in my brain  
Maybe you could find someone else to blame  
For all this pain, maybe, maybe, maybe  
Maybe you could tell me about your worst fear  
Don't say it out loud, whisper in my ear  
Ain't never felt nothing like this here  
Maybe you could see things a little more clear  
Dry away your tears  
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking  
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often  
Maybe I should give this woman my name, a piece of my pain  
Maybe, maybe, maybe  
Maybe we could talk about all my dreams  
Watch them all come apart at the seams  
Sometimes when it rains it really teams  
Sometimes they cut diamonds with laser beams  
Whatever that means  
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking  
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often  
Maybe I should give this woman my time, that would be fine  
Maybe, maybe, maybe  
I love you are just three words that are overused when we're talking  
Love and friendship, situations get confusing so often  
Maybe I should give this woman my name, a piece of my pain  
Maybe, maybe, maybe

A trust betrayed a rusty blade  
Standing on edge  
I walked a line, paid my fine  
Hope I know the ledge  
Actual facts, unnatural acts, sins they take their toll  
The angel and the jinn and the beast within, the fight to take control  
Chorus  
Lord, have mercy on my soul  
On my soul, on my soul, on my soul  
Lord, I need ya like a junkie needs his drugs  
Need ya like a baby boy needs his hugs  
Need ya like a flower needs the sun  
I need you like D.M.C needs Run  
Chorus  
Love you like a Eskimos love the cold  
Love you like a miner man love his gold  
Love you like a fisherman love the sea  
Love you like the flowers love the bees  
Chorus  
Standing up tall on top of the wall  
Hoping I can fly Angel and the jinn  
and the beast within' say I'm gonna die  
Chorus

Dollar dollar bills  
Deutch, marks, franks, yens, and pounds  
I rock the jocked up sounds  
From Devenshire Downs  
  
Out the Fordham Road  
Up top in the boogie  
I be loyal to my peeps  
Like budha stud doogie  
  
Never very bad news  
Payin' crazy dues  
I'm blowin' out crews  
And tamin' mad shrews  
  
Like Bill Shakespeare  
The fakes will disappear  
The flavor in your ear  
Is strong like Everclear  
  
Two hundred proofs  
So put the match to the roof  
And set this bitch on fire  
Get rich, the empire's  
  
About to strike back  
If you rock the mic wack  
And that's the way it is 'cause yo  
It's like that  
  
[Sadat X]  
Money, money y'all  
It be the root of all evil  
  
[Sadat X]  
Money, money y'all  
It makes you popular with people  
I go back to the 80's  
Like three times a lady  
  
When it was pussy for free  
And crack for currency  
It just occurred to me  
It's time for surgery  
  
I remove MC's like tumors  
The lies and the rumors  
Got me thinkin' of this dub  
By Timex Social Club  
  
Yo, word to my momma  
I'm high off the trauma  
Whitey Ford gets deeper than subway trains  
And I serve lazy fools like fast food chains  
  
All pain no gain  
Makes the brain insane  
Life in the fast laneT  
He flakes the cash gains (for real)  
  
[Sadat X]  
Dollar bill y'all  
Dollar bill y'all  
Dollar dollar dollar dollar dollar bill y'all  
It takes money  
  
[Sadat X]  
To get that fly ass ho  
It takes money  
  
[Sadat X]  
To see me rock a live show  
It takes money  
  
[Sadat X]  
To get that last bag of smoke  
'Cause they kindly take from it when that ass was broke  
Hey yo I'm about to g-off  
Just like my name was Ed-o  
  
Black kids call me whitey  
Spanish kids wetto  
White kids call me the king of this be -boy thing  
If it's broke then fix it  
  
If it's wack remix it  
Can't none of you MC's ever fuck with these  
You be crazy on my dick  
Like some porno chick  
  
For the style that I'm blessin'  
Ain't no second guessin'  
Kid heed the lesson, subtraction, addition  
Reward for submissionA  
  
In to no debate  
Won't stop till I'm eatin' off a platinum plate  
I want the stocks and bonds  
Plus the real estate  
  
I want the iron gates  
And low interest rates  
Plus a fly little spot to bring all my dates  
A little stash of the cash put aside in a safe  
  
When times get lean  
Y'all know what I mean  
  
[Sadat X]  
Money money y'all  
Some be callin' it cream  
  
[Sadat X]  
Money money y'all  
Some be callin' it fame  
  
[Sadat X]  
Money money y'all  
But once I get it I'm J  
  
I want cash and checks  
I want diamond rings  
I want jewels on my neck  
And mad fly things  
  
I want a stack of fat chips  
So I can take long trips  
I want to sail the Bahamas  
On my own cruise ships  
  
I want acres of land  
I want papers in hand  
I want stocks and bonds  
All pros no cons  
  
Hey if it smells funny  
Then back it up honey  
I want the money y'all  
I need the money y'all...

Aha  
'And there, but for the grace of God, go I'  
It's kinda neat  
I wonder what it means  
  
I rock a jam for love  
I quit my band for love  
I'll smack the chrome tool right out your hand for love  
Make you cry like a dove  
Leave you standin' alone  
In a world so cold  
Watch the drama unfold  
'Cause you sell your soul  
Now you're fearin' your death  
Sniffin' crystal meth 'till there ain't none left  
But, rock bottom hurts when you hit it  
You start to reflect on all the friends you shitted  
You probably won't admit it  
So you start to sink lower  
You're caught in the flood  
And you're tryin' to find Noah  
If you hungry and your near me yo, you gonna get fed  
If you sleepy and you need a place to lay your head  
Then come take my bed  
I'll sleep on the floor  
'Cause these are the times that friends are for  
  
Chorus (X2)  
I see everybody out here doin' for self  
And they don't give a damn on the next man  
Puttin' status and wealth over God and health  
I can't wait 'till you the next man  
  
I get uptight for love  
You know I'll fight for love  
I might keep my wifey up all night for love  
And when the daylight comes  
I be seein' mad bums  
With no shoes on their feet  
Plus nothin' to eat  
I can't save the whole street  
So I feel like I'm beat  
And why play the game when nothin' goin' to change  
The only change that's wanted is loose in my jeans  
I get rushed on every corner by a bum or a fiend  
Tryin' to keep my dean  
I try to give to the poor  
Tryin' to get through this life  
And get through that door  
I'm all up in this mix  
For these final tics  
Goin' all the way to seven  
And it's half past six  
  
Chorus (X2)  
  
I pray to God for love  
I'll make Jihad for love  
And I just might pull your freakin' card for love  
Make you sing 'Hey Love' like my man King Son  
I freak the art noise  
Over all you toys  
Better bring your boys  
Summon all your crew  
No matter what you do  
It's comin' back on you  
Just like a planet orbits  
Let your sponge absorb it  
It's logical conclusion  
It's b-boy fusion  
And confusion say that he want control  
Of your mentality  
Your body and your soul  
So if you lose your whole  
Come and take my hand  
And link up this jam  
'Cause money that's the plan  
Tryin' to get through this maze  
Not to win this race  
We either ridin' on our horse  
Or walkin' on our face  
So come take your place on the side of love  
And swallow up your ego and your pride for love  
  
Chorus (X2)  
  
Can't wait 'till you the next man  
Can't wait 'till you the next man...

(It's Whitey. . . and the Likwit) repeats several times  
Watch me rock these sounds from the Polo Grounds  
To the Sunset Strip, I'm like an acid trip  
I'm flashing back on ya, run it up on ya  
Born in Hempstead L.I., raised in California  
Mister entrepreneur, I rock the shot that's sure  
I need a dime plus more, I sip the finely corked  
I want the cash in hand, and the beats front land  
And I get loco from Acapulco to Japan  
Mister Whitey Ford gets terrain explored  
You perpetrate that Ford, you must be out your gourd  
It's time make like break nights kid, and praise the lord  
Keep the faith, smoke your eighth  
Continue stackin' papers all up in my safe  
Commence to motivate, assume an altered state  
And kill your whole wack show like I'm Edgar Alan Poe  
It's the psychotic thriller, no peckerwood's iller  
Than this freckled face man with the farmer's tan  
If I can't bomb on you, I'm bombin' on your man  
Chorus:  
Some get the shit, sugar, some get the stains  
Some get the muscles, baby, some get the brains  
Some get the powers, love, some get the papers  
Some catch the vibes and some catch the vapors  
Better . . . [Praise the Lord . . . Keep, keep the faith (4x)]  
I say roll to the rock, rock to the roll  
Whitey Ford brings the devastating mic control  
Like Darrell McDaniel, a hundred g's annual  
The tips get clocked baby, the bonds get stocked  
My style gets rocked just like doors get knocked  
With legendary status like my name's Lou Brock  
And my lanzar sounds be shaking the grounds  
Hunting down crews, like packs of bloodhounds  
Snatching off crowns and melting 'em down  
I once was lost, see but now I'm found  
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
And when the saints come marchin' in . .  
(Keep the faith)  
I messed the alpine white, classic rapper's delight  
All these shorties pullin' tools, cause they know they can't fight  
I bang my selections on worldwide connections  
So get the seven digits baby, never burn your bridges  
Chorus 2x

I seen her at a stop light on Alverano  
Was sittin' in a pearl white Eldorado  
In a gangsta lean she were revvin' the throttle  
Got a sticker on the bumper say she like techano  
She looked like Selena, the truth couldn't be plainer  
She like a gangsta boogie, her mama calls her cookie  
My friends call her a sad girl cause her man went away  
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea  
Sad girl living on the east side of the city  
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity  
Sad girl got no one to rely on  
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on  
I seen her at the market she was pushing a stroller  
Smoking on a cigarette, drinkin' a soda  
Laughin' at a joke that somebody just told her  
Got her baby's name tattooed on the back of her shoulder  
She looked like an angel, she talked like the devil  
She looked like a stranger, she lived like a rebel  
She's a sad girl, cause her man went away  
And he ain't never coming back, so cry another tattoo sea  
Sad girl living on the east side of the city  
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity  
Sad girl got no one to rely on  
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on  
Hey sad girl, we can take this slow  
Baby what you lookin' for, let me know  
You say you want a man that can give you some dough  
You say buy my babyshoes and buy him a coat  
And buy my baby food to put down his throat  
I won't play you like a ho, it ain't like that yo  
Let me holler at you later, we can go to the show  
I ain't tryna rock the boat, I'm tryna keep you afloat  
I seen her at the post office mailing a letter  
She couldn't send no money but she made him a sweater  
She's talking on the pay phone and something upset her  
I really want to hold her but I only just met her  
But I could tell she'd been crying, she said she felt like dying  
She never been so alone no, she gotta make it on her own though  
She's a sad girl, cause her man went away  
And he ain't never coming back  
Sad girl living on the east side of the city  
Proud woman, boy, she don't want none of your pity  
Sad girl got no one to rely on  
Proud woman don't need your shoulder to cry on

To all the killers and a hundred dollar billas  
For real dealers that ain't got no feelings  
Check it out now  
I got you stuck off the realness, we be the infamous, you heard of us  
Official White folks murderers  
My mobb comes equipped with warfare, beware  
Of my crime family who got nuff shots to share  
For all those who wanna profile and pose  
Rock you in your face, stab your brain with your nose bone  
You all alone in these streets, cousin  
Every man for their self in this land, we be gunnin'  
And keep them shook crews runnin' like they supposed to  
They come around but they never come close to  
I can see it inside your face, you're in the wrong place  
Cowards like you just get their whole body laced up  
With bullet holes and such  
Speak to wrong words man and you will get touched  
You could put your whole army against my team  
And I guarantee you it'll be your very last time breathin'  
Your simple words just don't move me, you're minor, we're major  
You all up in the game and don't deserve to be a player  
Don't make me have to call your name out  
Your crew is featherweight, my gunshots'll make you levitate  
I'm only nineteen but my mind is old  
And when the things get for realm my warm heart turns cold  
Another figga deceased, another story gets told  
It ain't nothin' really, hey, yo dun spark the Phillie  
So I can get my mind off these yellow backed niggas  
Why they still alive, I don't know, go figure  
Meanwhile back in L.A., the foundation  
If I had to die, couldn't choose a better location  
When the slugs penetrate you feel a burning sensation  
Getting closer to God in a tight situation  
Now, take these words home and think it through  
Or the next rhyme I write might be about you  
Son, they shook 'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
Scared to death and scared to look  
You shook, there's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
Scared to death and scared to look  
You shook 'cause ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look  
You shook, there's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death and scared to look  
Livin' the life with the diamonds and guns  
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds  
Some get shot, locked down and turn nuns  
Cowardly hearts end straight up shook ones  
You ain't a crook son, you just a shook one  
There's a war goin' on outside, no man is safe from  
You can run but you can't hide forever  
In these streets that we done took  
You walking with your head down scared to look  
You shook 'cause there ain't no such thing as half way crooks  
There never around when the beef cooks  
And my part of town is similar to Vietnam  
Now we all grown up and hold heavy on the cops control  
You better have the right gear ready  
Tryin' back me and get rock steady  
By the mac one double, I'll touch you  
Leave you with not much to go home with  
My skin is thick 'cause I be up in the mix of action  
If I'm not at home puffin', lie, relaxin', I lay got a nigga depress  
So I wear a stuff [Incomprehensible] underneath my gest  
In the life filled with diamonds and guns  
There's numerous ways you can choose to earn funds  
But some get shot, locked down and turn nuns  
Cowardly hearts say straight up, shook ones  
You shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
Scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
There's ain't no such things as halfway crooks  
You scared to death, you scared to look, to shook  
You ain't a crook son, you just shook one  
You ain't a crook son, you just shook one  
Just shook one  
You ain't a crook son, you just shook one  
Just shook one  

So Long  
From "End of Days" soundtrack  
  
D'you ever had bad dreams?  
All I have is bad dreams  
I knew a man with a son  
He bought him a gun  
And learned Shorty just how to use it  
Taught him huntin' and skinnin'  
Right from the beginnin'  
Built himself a mighty fine killa  
Killa  
But Shorty got picked on  
Beat on and kicked on  
Now all his classmates want to punk him  
So the tears in his eye may catch him in the rye  
Told his old man he went huntin'  
Never felt so free  
Like his destiny  
Their was someone out on the horizon  
His heart went cold, he felt a hundred years old  
Started pullin' back on the trigga  
  
I think I'm gonna die today  
Today, today, today  
Everyone who hurt me's gonna pay  
Pay, pay, pay  
How can such a short time feel so long?  
Long, long, long  
How can such a young life go so wrong?  
Wrong, wrong, wrong  
Go so wrong  
  
What'll it gonna take  
For you to really make it in life?  
  
See me (x2)  
Hear me (x2)  
But don't touch me  
You should fear me  
(Fear me)  
Hold your life dearly  
Cause I'm seriously disturbed  
That's my word  
(My word)  
Straight to my mother  
Wade, my brother  
(Brother)  
Found another  
One to play sucker  
Cause I ain't the one  
Who has shaded your son  
And took all your shine  
Watch me get mine  
And feel my love burn  
(Burn)  
Pay for my sins  
Watch me grow turns  
Psycho begins  
(Psycho)  
Losses he wins  
Angels in heels  
Dancin' on top  
Of Heaven, pimp  
Don't know where I'm goin'  
But I know where I've been  
You can't hear a sound  
Clappin' for a pound  
I came to get down  
I came to get dirty  
I came to get even  
Even, even, even  
  
(x3) I think I'm gonna die today  
Today, today, today  
Everyone who hurt me's gonna pay  
Pay, pay, pay  
How can such a short time feel so long?  
Long, long, long  
How can such a young life go so wrong?  
Wrong, wrong, wrong (x3)  
  
Momma don't cry  
Please, momma don't cry  
Momma don't cry, you did nothing wrong

You came into my life, I don't have to wonder no more  
I can feel it all in my soul  
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn  
I can see I got a good foundation, deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music  
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul  
Yo, first took breath in Hemstead, Long Island  
Born American, ancestry from Ireland  
You ain't knowin' me, you better stop smilin'  
Ain't nothin' funny once my dummies start whilin'  
You talkin' loud now all a sudden it's silent  
Your premenitions say it's about to get violent  
You want permission just to blink your own eyelid  
I got my soldiers, everywhere they go, I win  
No stick moves, ain't no cap peeling  
Where I come from real men don't catch feelings  
We don't rhyme about fake jacks or drug dealin'  
The shit I drop will leave all your brains on the ceiling  
Mass appealin', done it since the 80's  
Rock rhymes for my dogs, sing songs for my ladies  
Spend money like crazy, ain't got no babies  
If I don't make it in Heaven I'll run shit in Hades  
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music  
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul  
It's in my soul, soul music  
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul, soul music  
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul  
Yo I shit on competition, spit on percussion  
Beats are bone crushin', one deep I'm bum rushin'  
Guns they get stuck in, someone starts buckin'  
The jewels that I'm truckin' got pimps upchuckin'  
You can't hold me down, you can't hold my hand  
A full grown man with the one God plan  
I represent the colors that never run  
God bless DMC, God bless Reverend Run  
R.I.P. for the JMJ  
Tell BIG and Scott LaRock that we all say hey  
Be like 2Pac or be like Kid N Play  
Do you want to burn out or just fade away  
And I can rock the mic without no delay  
With my head to the ground everytime I pray  
You can catch a heart attack or get blown away  
Cause this type of shit happens everyday  
Feel the burn, I can feel it in my soul  
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul  
Feel the burn, it's in my soul  
It's soul music, it's deep down in my soul, feel the burn  
Now I can see I got a good foundation deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul, it's soul music  
I feel the need for contemplation deep down in my soul  
It's in my soul, soul music  
And I can feel a dark sensation deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul, soul music  
Tryin' to find an explanation deep down in my soul  
It's deep down in my soul, feel the burn

I just can't do it, not anymore  
Every time I fake a smile I feel just like a whore  
I just can't do it, it's beyond my means  
And all I know about love reading fashion magazines  
I just can't do it, it can't be done  
That's just what I say cause I know I'm not the one  
  
And I've been moving for so long  
Life's a million miles away  
I'm the one that made you strong girl  
But I could not make you stay  
  
I just can't do it, it's much too hard,  
I drive around alone at night up and down the boulevard  
I just can't do it, I feel so old  
It looks like the sun is shining but the wind's blowing cold  
I just can't do it, it's gone too far  
I sit at home alone at night just wondering where you are  
  
And I've been standing still so long  
My minds a million miles away  
I'm the one that made you strong girl  
But I could not make you stay  
  
I just can't do it, no matter how hard I try  
You don't come around anymore but I know the reason why  
I just can't do it, it's way too late  
I hang on with all my might I can't accept this fate  
I just can't do it, I feel so bad  
I sit around and think about the chances that I've had  
  
And I've been hurting for so long  
You're a million miles away  
I'm the one that made you strong girl  
But I could not make you stay  
But I could not make you stay  
No, I could not make you stay

Don't throw no roses on my grave, boo  
Death's not a soldier, it's more like an angel  
You got no where to run, no one to pray to  
Jesus and Moses ain't comin' to save you  
(The greatest, the the the greatest)  
  
I float like a butterfly, I sting like a hornet  
They won't let me have it  
Not even if no one else want it  
And if I try to take it  
They want to break me down and strip me naked  
They write a brand new rule and break it  
They lie, they cheat, they steal, they fake it  
  
But I'mma make it, Lord I can take it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
I can't sweat it, know I got to get it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Without no doubt, my name will survive  
(The greatest the the greatest man alive)  
(The greatest man)  
(The greatest, the the)  
  
I'mma make it, Lord I can take it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
I can't sweat it, I know I got to get it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Without no doubt, my name will survive  
(The, the greatest man alive)  
  
(The greatest, the the greatest man)  
(The the, the greatest man alive)  
(The, the the greatest, the the the greatest man)  
(The greatest man alive)  
  
I'mma make it, I know that I can take it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Cut the drama boy, save it for your mama  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
I can't sweat it, I know I gotta get it  
I'm the (The greatest man alive)  
Without no doubt my name will survive  
(The greatest man, the greatest man alive)  
  
It only gets harder  
It always seems so far away  
The sky's getting darker  
Another storm is on the way  
(The the greatest, the the the greatest)  
Another storm is on the way  
(The the the the greatest, the the greatest)  
(The greatest man alive)  

Every man's bound to fall  
Every man's bound to fall  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
(It's) happenin' all the time  
Livin by Murphy's Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every man's bound to fall  
  
Life is short, the grind is long  
Some of my very best friends are gone  
My hustle's strong my money's all spent  
On buying bitches titties and drugs and rent  
Work a double shift grind, I can't save a dime  
My daughter needs medicine I just can't afford  
Bout to grab a .9, lose my mind  
My insurance keeps sayin that they won't pay for it  
I'll stage the heist, I'll pay the price  
Don't be shocked when I turn to crime, kid  
I'm goin big, I might split your wig  
Cause I ain't getting knocked for no nickel'n'dime shit  
All that glitters ain't all it seems  
The American dream is an American scheme  
What you're looking at, what you're trippin on  
Who you flippin on, see what I'm grippin on  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
(It's) happenin' all the time  
Livin by Murphy's Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every man's bound to fall  
  
I've been breakin my neck just to live correct  
Keep my head above water, living check to check  
I get no respect, I got no regard  
Patience is a struggle when times is hard  
Paper's in the shortage, tryin to pay the mortgage  
I can't get to work, they repossess my car  
Bout to buy a pistol and kidnap Bristol  
Tell me bitch, can you see me from your backyard?  
This New World session of the Great Depression  
I'm living off preemptive unchecked aggression  
You're cryin and you're bitchin, know it every politician:  
My family tradition is heavy ammunition  
I cock the hammer, I'ma rock the vote  
Got your forhead on lock, dead in my scope  
Look me in the eye, what you're lying for  
What you're living by, what you dyin for  
  
Pain inside my heart  
Trouble stay on my mind  
Everything falls apart  
(It's) happenin' all the time  
Livin by Murphy's Law  
Tryin to have it all  
Running from instant karma  
Every man's bound to fall

I'm Everlast born to be a caucassion but it makes no difference what
persuasion you are  
As long as you know how to get up on the floor and start workin' a sweat  
To a musical measure that makes you move as soon as the needle drops into the
groove  
So get up and dance to the gift I'm giving, forget about your troubles get
into the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)  
Talking 'bout the rhythm (all we need is rhythm)

Yo, yo, you know what the world needs...we need peace, rhythm

You linger for the rap singer, when Donald D brings the party to the deal my
presence is felt world wide  
You don't dance to this it's suicide  
Put your hands into the air on, the M.C. cop, the girlies are pipen' hot  
Natorious Lama is how I'm livin' don't step to me step to the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm

You make me feel so good  
Like I said before the world needs a lot more rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Talking 'bout the rhythm  
Listen to the tracks that rolls, watch the mic as it glows  
The lethal weapon got you trapped in this dance mode  
Ice-T's throwin' words at you like dodge ball y'all  
You gotta move get hit, if you get hit, you fall, no jokin', no boastin' and
no bragging  
Grip the mic like a .44 magnum, dust you off if you suck 'cause I ain't  
You want me to write soft rhyme's, sorry, I write the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm  
(Talking 'bout) the rhythm

We need rhythm for the world to have peace and unity, we must first have
rhythm  
  

Whitey, Whitey, Whitey, Whitey... Ford, Ford...

The white boy is back  
And you know he can never be wack  
The white boy is back  
  
The white boy is back  
With his foot up in your ass crack  
The white boy is back ('cause you know he's the white boy)  
  
The white boy is back  
And you know that he never smoke crack  
The white boy is back ('cause you know he's the white boy)

Sitting alone tonight, rain falling on my window sill  
Just want to do what's right, but I don't know if I ever will  
There's so many reasons, too many excuses  
And all these prescriptions, got too many uses  
I'm so lonely, it's kinda scary  
This kind of lonely is making me weary  
I'm so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight, waiting for the sunshine  
Sometimes I kneel and pray, hoping someday that you'll be mine  
But she's so many miles away, I've got so many things to say  
And all of the games we'd play don't matter anyway  
Cause I'm so lonely, the sex is empty  
This kind of lonely, it's so easy to tempt me  
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die  
Sitting alone tonight, waiting for somebody to call  
Think if I'm up and died would nobody notice at all  
Cause I'm so insecure, and I feel so unsure  
Can't take it anymore, it's never been like this before  
And I'm so lonely, I feel like crying  
This kind of lonely is worse than dying  
I'm so lonesome I could die, I'm so lonesome I could die  
I'm so lonesome I could die

We're all gonna die  
When I was a very young boy, mamma told me we all gonna die  
Mamma said son love can't be trusted, it's just another weakness  
We all gonna die  
  
[Chorus :]  
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie,  
We're all gonna die  
Baby don't cry, praise the most high, tell you no lie  
We all gonna die  
  
Now I'm grown, seen a lot livin', made a few friends  
Gonna get high, hoping I don't take more than I'm given  
Judgement day comin', we all gonna die  
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Baby getting born, old man die'n  
Young lady laughin', old woman cryin'  
Leaving like a lamb, comin' back like a lion  
Babylon to Zion, we're all gonna die  
  
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die  
When I was a very young boy mamma told me, we're all gonna die  
Mama said, son, love can't be trusted  
Its just another weakness, we're all gonna die  
Praise the most high, we're all gonna die  
If my wings should fail me lord, meet me with another pair  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]

(What is it?)  
(This is everlasting)  
Step up while I inject  
An overdose of intellect  
An overload of my vibrations  
Better yet a new sensation  
I was lost but then he found me  
Though corruption did surround me  
I was taken to a higher  
Level of earth and fire  
Where the souls of men would burn  
They were taught but did not learn  
About the righteous laws of God  
We're all just seeds among the sod  
Take any roots and tryin to grow  
Though the process may seem slow  
Please take heed to my suggestion  
Learn the answer to the question  
What is this  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)  
(Heavens to Mergatroid)  
(What is it?)  
Not speakin on my physical, my mental, or my aura  
I'm speaking on my soul, for to burn would be true horror  
There's no such thing as luck, your life is in the hands of God  
So do not treat his righteous laws with blatant disregard  
In order to follow the Lord's path, here's all you must do  
Do unto each of your brothers as you'd have them do you  
This golden rule is all you need, and you will be rewarded  
The man that don't, will pay the price and believe me, you can't afford it  
Because  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)  
This is for the ones who war over whose God is the right one  
Can it be the Asian one, the black one or the white one?  
The answer to the question really isn't controversial  
There is only one God and his love is universal  
If you sin and crave redemption, all you need to do is ask him  
Then you will be fully prepared for a life that's everlasting  
So take heed to the words I say, grab a good book and get hip to  
The teachings of the holy Q'uran or the Bible's holy scripture  
Because  
(This is everlasting)  
(What is it?)  
What is this?  
(This is everlasting)
