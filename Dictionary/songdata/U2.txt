Shake! Shake!  
  
Don't go  
I believe in a celebration  
I believe you set me free  
I believe you can loose this chains  
I believe you can dance with me  
Dance with me  
  
Shake! Shake!  
Shake! Shake!  
  
I believe in the third world war  
I believe in the atomic bomb  
I believe in the powers that be  
But they won't overpower me  
  
And, and you can go there too  
And, and you can go go go go  
  
Shake! Shake!  
Shake! Shake!  
  
And we dance out of time  
And everything goes 'round and 'round  
And we don't have the time  
To watch the world go tumbling down  
  
Go! Go!  
  
I believe in the bells of Christchurch  
Ringing for this land  
I believe in the cells of Mount joy  
There's an honest man  
  
And, and you can go there too  
And, and you can go go go go  
  
I believe in the walls of Jericho  
I believe they're coming down  
I believe in this city's children  
I believe the trumpet's sound  
  
And you can go there too  
And you can go go go go.  
  
I believe in what I'm doing  
What am I doing here.

Starting a landslide in my ego  
Look from the outside  
To the world I left behind  
  
I'm dreaming  
You're awake  
If I were sleeping  
What's at stake  
A day without me  
  
Whatever the feelings  
I keep feeling  
What are the feelings  
You left behind  
  
Today's a day without me  
  
I started a landslide in my ego  
Look from the outside  
To the world I left behind  
  
In the world I left behind  
Wipe their eyes, and then let go  
To the world I left behind  
Shed a tear, and then let go...

Little sister don't you worry about a thing today  
Take the heat from the sun  
Little sister  
I know that everything is not ok  
But you're like honey on my tongue  
  
True love never can be rent  
But only true love can keep beauty innocent  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
No I could never take a chance  
'Cause I could never understand  
The mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
You can run from love  
And if it's really love it will find you  
Catch you by the heel  
But you can't be numb for love  
The only pain is to feel nothing at all  
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?  
  
I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
And you're the one, there's no-one else  
You make me want to lose myself  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
Brown eyed girl across the street  
On rue Saint Divine  
I thought this is the one for me  
But she was already mine  
You were already mine...  
  
Little sister  
I've been sleeping in the street again  
Like a stray dog  
Little sister  
I've been trying to feel complete again  
But you're gone and so is God  
  
The soul needs beauty for a soul mate  
When the soul wants...the soul waits ...  
  
No I could never take a chance  
Of losing love to find romance  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
For love and sex and faith and fear  
And all the things that keep us here  
In the mysterious distance  
Between a man and a woman  
  
How can I hurt when I'm holding you?

And you know it's time to go  
Through the sleet and driving snow  
Across the fields of mourning  
Light in the distance  
  
And you hunger for the time  
Time to heal, desire, time  
And your earth moves beneath  
Your own dream landscape  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
On borderland we run  
  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Tonight  
A high road  
A high road out from here  
  
The city walls are all come down  
The dust, a smoke screen all around  
See faces ploughed like fields that once  
Gave no resistance  
  
And we live by the side of the road  
On the side of a hill  
As the valley explode  
Dislocated, suffocated  
The land grows weary of its own  
  
Oh, oh, oh on borderland we run  
And still we run  
We run and don't look back  
I'll be there  
I'll be there  
Tonight  
Tonight  
  
I'll be there tonight I believe  
I'll be there somehow  
I'll be there tonight  
Tonight  
  
The wind will crack in winter time  
This bomb-blast lightning waltz  
No spoken words, just a scream  
  
Tonight we'll build a bridge  
Across the sea and land  
See the sky, the burning rain  
She will die and live again  
Tonight  
  
And your heart beats so slow  
Through the rain and fallen snow  
Across the fields of mourning  
Light's in the distance  
  
Oh don't sorrow, no don't weep  
For tonight, at last  
I am coming home  
I am coming home

Don't believe what you hear  
Don't believe what you see  
If you just close your eyes  
You can feel the enemy  
When I first met you girl  
You had fire in your soul  
What happened your face of melting in snow?  
Now it looks like this  
  
And you can swallow  
Or you can spit  
You can throw it up  
Or choke on it  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
You know that your time is coming 'round  
So don't let the bastards grind you down  
  
No, nothing makes sense  
Nothing seems to fit  
I know you'd hit out  
If you only knew who to hit  
And I'd join the movement  
If there was one I could believe in  
Yeah I'd break bread and wine  
If there was a church I could receive in  
'Cause I need it now  
  
To take the cup  
To fill it up  
To drink it slow  
I can't let you go  
I must be an acrobat  
To talk like this  
And act like that  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
And don't let the bastards grind you down  
  
Oh, it hurts baby  
What are we going to do? Now it's all been said  
No new ideas in the house and every book has been read  
  
And I must be an acrobat  
To talk like this  
And act like that  
And you can dream  
So dream out loud  
And you can find  
Your own way out  
And you can build  
And I can will  
And you can call  
I can't wait until  
You can stash  
And you can seize  
Responsibilities  
And I can love  
And I can love  
And I know that the tide is turning 'round  
So don't let the bastards grind you down

I was born a child of grace  
Nothing else about the place  
Everything was ugly but your beautiful face  
And it left me no illusion  
  
I saw you in the curve of the moon  
In the shadow cast across my room  
You heard me in my tune  
When I just heard confusion  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am...I am  
  
I like the sound of my own voice  
I didn't give anyone else a choice  
An intellectual tortoise  
Racing with your bullet train  
  
Some people get squashed crossing the tracks  
Some people got high rises on their backs  
I'm not broke but you can see the cracks  
You can make me perfect again  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am...I am  
  
I'm alive  
I'm being born  
I just arrived, I'm at the door  
Of the place I started out from  
And I want back inside  
  
All because of you  
All because of you  
All because of you  
I am

You say you want  
Diamonds on a ring of gold  
You say you want  
Your story to remain untold  
  
But all the promises we make  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You say you'll give me  
A highway with no one on it  
Treasure just to look upon it  
All the riches in the night  
  
You say you'll give me  
Eyes in a moon of blindness  
A river in a time of dryness  
A harbor in the tempest  
  
But all the promises we make  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You say you want  
Your love to work out right  
To last with me through the night  
  
You say you want  
Diamonds on a ring of gold  
Your story to remain untold  
Your love not to grow cold  
  
All the promises we break  
From the cradle to the grave  
When all I want is you  
  
You... all I want is...  
You... all I want is...  
You... all I want is...  
You...

It was a cold and wet December day  
When we touched the ground at JFK  
Snow was melting on the ground  
On BLS I heard the sound  
Of an angel  
  
New York, like a Christmas tree  
Tonight this city belongs to me  
Angel  
  
Soul love...this love won't let me go  
So long...angel of Harlem  
  
Birdland on fifty-three  
The street sounds like a symphony  
We got John Coltrane and a love supreme  
Miles, and she's got to be an angel  
  
Lady Day got diamond eyes  
She sees the truth behind the lies  
Angel  
  
Soul love...this love won't let me go  
So long...angel of Harlem  
Angel of Harlem  
  
She says it's heart...heart and soul...  
Yeah yeah...(yeah)  
Yeah yeah...(right now)  
  
Blue light on the avenue  
God knows they got to you  
An empty glass, the lady sings  
Eyes swollen like a bee sting  
Blinded you lost your way  
Through the side streets and the alleyway  
Like a star exploding in the night  
Falling to the city in broad daylight  
An angel in Devil's shoes  
Salvation in the blues  
You never looked like an angel  
Yeah yeah...angel of Harlem  
  
Angel...angel of Harlem...  
[Repeat and fade]

Wake up  
The dawn of another dull day  
Take up  
Your dreams and on your way  
Oh oh ooh  
  
Daylight  
Mother stands in the hall  
Last night  
Head against the wall  
Oh oh ooh  
  
When night turns to day  
And the children come out to play  
Another day  
  
Stop, shake out  
They came my way  
Oh oh ooh...  
  
Boy, salute in a street uniform  
Toy, soldier ripped and torn  
Oh oh ooh  
  
When night turns to day  
And the children come out to play  
Another day  
  
Stop, shout  
They came my way  
Oh oh ooh

The heart is a bloom  
Shoots up through the stony ground  
There's no room  
No space to rent in this town  
  
You're out of luck  
And the reason that you had to care  
The traffic is stuck  
And you're not moving anywhere  
  
You thought you'd found a friend  
To take you out of this place  
Someone you could lend a hand  
In return for grace  
  
It's a beautiful day  
Sky falls, you feel like  
It's a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
  
You're on the road  
But you've got no destination  
You're in the mud  
In the maze of her imagination  
  
You're lovin' this town  
Even if that doesn't ring true  
You've been all over  
And it's been all over you  
  
It's a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
It's a beautiful day  
  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Teach me  
I know I'm not a hopeless case  
  
See the world in green and blue  
See China right in front of you  
See the canyons broken by cloud  
See the tuna fleets clearing the sea out  
See the Bedouin fires at night  
See the oil fields at first light  
And see the bird with a leaf in her mouth  
After the flood all the colors came out  
  
It was a beautiful day  
Don't let it get away  
Beautiful day  
  
Touch me  
Take me to that other place  
Reach me  
I know I'm not a hopeless case  
  
What you don't have you don't need it now  
What you don't know you can feel it somehow  
What you don't have you don't need it now  
Don't need it now  
Was a beautiful day

Oh oh oh

Yesterday I spent asleep  
Woke up in my clothes in a dirty heap  
Spent the night trying to make a deadline  
Squeezing complicated lives into a simple headline  
I have your face in an old Polaroid  
Tidying the childrens clothes and toys  
You smiling back at me I took the photo from the fridge  
Can't remember what Emily did  
Haven't been with a woman, it feels like, for years  
Thought of you the whole time, your salty tears  
This shitty world sometimes produces a rose  
The scent of it lingers but then it just goes  
  
Return the call to home  
  
The worst of us are a long drawn-out confession  
The best of us are geniuses of compression  
You say you're not gonna leave the truth alone  
I'm here 'cause I don't wanna go home  
Child drinking dirty water from a riverbank  
Soldier brings oranges he got out from a tank  
Waiting on the waiter, he's taking a while to come  
Watching the sun go down on Lebanon  
  
Return the call to home  
  
I got a head like a lit cigarette  
Unholy clouds reflect in a minaret  
So high above me, higher than everyone  
Where are you in the cedars of Lebanon?  
Choose your enemies carefully, 'cause they will define you  
Make them interesting 'cause in some ways they will mind you  
They're not there in the beginning but when your story ends  
Gonna last with you longer than your friends

The more you see the less you know  
The less you find out as you grow  
I knew much more then than I do now  
  
Neon heart, day-glow eyes  
The city lit by fireflies  
They're advertising in the skies  
And people like us  
  
And I miss you when you're not around  
I'm getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...in the city of blinding lights  
  
Don't think before you laugh  
Look ugly in a photograph  
Flash bulbs, purple irises the camera can't see  
  
I've seen you walk unafraid  
I've seen you in the clothes you've made  
Can you see the beauty inside of me?  
What happened to the beauty I had inside of me?  
  
And I miss you when you're not around  
I'm getting ready to leave the ground  
  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight...tonight  
In the city of blinding lights  
  
Time...time....time...won't leave me as I am  
But time won't take the boy out of this man  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
Oh you look so beautiful tonight  
  
The more you know, the less you feel  
Some pray for , others steal  
Blessings not just for the ones who kneel...luckily.

From the brightest star  
Comes the blackest hole  
You had so much to offer  
Why did you offer your soul?  
I was there for you baby  
When you needed my help  
Would you deny for others  
What you demand for yourself?  
  
Cool down mama, cool off  
Cool down mama, cool off  
  
You speak of signs and wonders  
I need something other  
I would believe if I was able  
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table  
  
You were pretty as a picture  
It was all there to see  
Then your face caught up with your psychology  
With a mouth full of teeth  
You ate all your friends  
And you broke every heart thinking every heart mends  
  
You speak of signs and wonders  
But I need something other  
I would believe if I was able  
But I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table  
  
Where you live should not decide  
Whether you live or whether you die  
Three to a bed  
Sister Ann, she said  
Dignity passes by  
  
And you speak of signs and wonders  
But I need something other  
I would believe if I was able  
I'm waiting on the crumbs from your table

You're a precious stone  
You're out on your own  
You know everyone in the world  
But you feel alone  
Daddy won't let you weep  
Daddy won't let you ache  
Daddy gives you as much as you can take  
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
A little uptight  
You're a baby's fist  
Butterfly kisses up and down your wrist  
When you see daddy coming  
You're licking your lip  
Nails bitten down to the quick  
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
You've got a head full of traffic  
You're a siren's song  
You cry for mama  
And daddy's right along  
He gives you the keys to a flamin' car  
Daddy's with you wherever you are  
Daddy's a comfort  
Daddy's your best friend  
Daddy'll hold your hand right up to the end  
A-ha sha-la, a-ha sha-la  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
Daddy's gonna pay for your crashed car  
  
Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday's  
Alright...

The sea, it swells like a sore head  
And the night, it is aching  
Two lovers lie with no sheets on their bed  
And the day, it is breaking  
  
On rainy days we go swimming out  
On rainy days swimming in the sound  
On rainy days we go swimming out  
  
You're in my mind all of the time  
I know that's not enough  
If the sky can crack there must be some way back  
For love and only love  
  
Car alarm won't let you back to sleep  
You're kept awake dreaming someone else's dream  
Coffee is cold, but it'll get you through  
Compromise, that's nothing new to you  
  
Let's see colors that have never been seen  
Let's go to places no one else has been  
  
You're in my mind all of the time  
I know that's not enough  
But if the sky can crack there must be some way back  
To love and only love  
  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Baby, don't cry  
  
It's hot as hell, honey, in this room  
Sure hope the weather will break soon  
The air is heavy, heavy as a truck  
We need the rain to wash away our bad luck  
  
Well, if the sky can crack, there must be some way back  
For love and only love  
  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
Electrical storm  
  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry  
Baby don't cry

Give me one more chance  
And you'll be satisfied  
Give me two more chances  
You won't be denied  
  
Well my heart is where it's always been  
My head is somewhere in between  
Give me one more chance  
There will be a lover tonight  
  
(Check it out)  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
Give me one last chance  
And I'm gonna make you sing  
Give me half a chance  
To ride on the waves that you bring  
  
You're honey child to a swarm of bees  
Gonna blow right through you like a breeze  
Give me one last chance  
We'll slide down the surface of things  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
  
We're free to fly the crimson sky  
The sun won't melt our wings tonight  
  
Oh now  
Here she comes  
  
Take me higher  
Take me higher  
Can you take me higher?  
Will you take me higher?  
  
You're the real thing  
Yeah the real thing  
You're the real thing  
  
Even better than the real thing  
Even better than the real thing  
Even better than the real thing.

You know he got the cure  
You know he went astray  
He used to stay awake  
To drive the dreams he had away  
He wanted to believe  
In the hands of love  
  
His head it felt heavy  
As he cut across the land  
A dog started crying  
Like a broken hearted man  
At the howling wind  
At the howling wind  
  
He went deeper into black  
Deeper into white  
Could see the stars shining  
Like nails in the night  
He felt the healing  
Healing, healing  
Healing hands of love  
Like the stars shiny shiny  
From above  
  
Hand in the pocket  
Finger on the steel  
The pistol weighed heavy  
His heart he could feel  
Was beating, beating  
Beating, beating oh my love  
Oh my love, oh my love  
Oh my love  
  
My love  
  
Saw the hands that build  
Can also pull down  
  
The hands of love

My cell is ringing  
No ID  
I need to know who's calling  
  
My garden's overgrown  
I go out on my belly crawling  
I got CCTV, pornography, CNBC  
I got the nightly news  
To get to know the enemy  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your face in a locket  
Picture in my pocket  
I take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
I'm going nowhere  
Where I am it is a lot of fun  
There in the desert to dismantle an atomic bomb  
I watch you shadow box  
Check the stocks  
I'm in detox  
I want the lot of what you've got  
What you've got can make this stop  
  
All I want is a picture of you  
All I want is to get right next to you  
All I want is your picture in a locket  
Your face in my pocket  
Take a pill to stop it  
  
I know these fast cars  
Will do me no good  
  
Child inside  
  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
Don't you worry 'bout your mind  
  
You should worry 'bout the day  
That the pain it goes away  
You know I miss mine sometimes  
  
The size is much too big  
  
There is no fiction  
That will truly fit the situation  
I'm documenting every detail  
Every conversation  
Not used to talkin' to somebody in the body  
Somebody in a body,  
Somebody in a body

Falling falling  
The sun is burning black  
Falling falling  
It's beating on my back  
With a fire  
With a fire  
  
Falling falling  
The moon is running red  
Falling falling  
It's pulling me instead  
With a fire  
Fire  
  
But there's a fire inside  
When I'm falling over  
There's a fire in me  
When I call out  
I built a fire  
I'm going home  
  
Falling falling  
The stars are falling down  
Falling falling  
They knock me to the ground  
With a fire  
Fire  
  
But there's a fire inside  
When I'm falling over  
There's a fire in me  
When I call out  
There's a fire inside  
When I'm falling over  
I feel the fire  
I'm going home

Some folks are born made to wave the flag  
Yeah, the red, white, and blue  
When the band plays 'Hail To The Chief'  
Yeah, they'll point the cannon at you  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I'm no millionaire's son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one  
  
Some folks are born silver spoon in hand  
Well, they help themselves, yeah  
When the tax man comes to the door  
House looks a like a rummage sale  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no millionaire's son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate one, no  
  
Some folks inherit star spangled eyes  
Yeah, when they send you down to war  
Well, when you ask them how much you should give  
Yeah, it's always more, more, more  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no senator's son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I'm no fortunate one  
  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no military son  
It ain't me, it ain't me  
I ain't no fortunate son  
Take it away...

I try to sing this song  
I...I try to stand up  
But I can't find my feet  
I try, I try to speak up  
But only in you I'm complete  
  
Gloria...in te domine  
Gloria...exultate  
Gloria...Gloria  
Oh Lord, loosen my lips  
  
I try to sing this song  
I...I try to get in  
But I can't find the door  
The door is open  
You're standing there  
You let me in  
  
Gloria...in te domine  
Gloria...exultate  
Oh Lord, if I had anything  
Anything at all  
I'd give it to you  
I'd give it to you  
  
Gloria...Gloria...

Don't believe the devil  
I don't believe his book  
But the truth is not the same  
Without the lies he made up  
  
Don't believe in excess  
Success is to give  
Don't believe in riches  
But you should see where I live  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in forced entry  
Don't believe in rape  
But every time she passes by  
Wild thoughts escape  
I don't believe in death row  
Skid row or the gangs  
Don't believe in the Uzi  
It just went off in my hand  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in cocaine  
Got a speed-ball in my head  
I could cut and crack you open  
Do you hear what I said  
Don't believe them when they tell me  
There ain't no cure  
The rich stay healthy  
While the sick stay poor  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in Goldman  
His type like a curse  
Instant karma's going to get him  
If I don't get him first  
Don't believe that rock 'n' roll  
Can really change the world  
As it spins in revolution  
It spirals and turns  
I...I believe in love  
  
Don't believe in the 60's  
The golden age of pop  
You glorify the past  
When the future dries up  
Heard a singer on the radio late last night  
He says he's gonna kick the darkness  
'til it bleeds daylight  
I...I believe in love  
  
I feel like I'm falling  
Like I'm spinning on a wheel  
It always stops beside of me  
With a presence I can feel  
I...I believe in love  
Stop!

Grace  
She takes the blame  
She covers the shame  
Removes the stain  
It could be her name  
  
Grace  
It's a name for a girl  
It's also a thought that  
Changed the world  
  
And when she walks on the street  
You can hear the strings  
Grace finds goodness  
In everything  
  
Grace  
She's got the walk  
Not on a ramp or on chalk  
She's got the time to talk  
  
She travels outside  
Of karma, karma  
She travels outside  
Of karma  
  
When she goes to work  
You can hear the strings  
Grace finds beauty  
In everything  
  
Grace  
She carries a world on her hips  
No champagne flute for her lips  
No twirls or skips  
Between her fingertips  
  
She carries a pearl  
In perfect condition  
What once was hurt  
What once was friction  
What left a mark  
No longer stings  
  
Because grace makes beauty  
Out of ugly things  
  
Grace finds beauty  
In everything  
  
Grace finds goodness  
In everything

Like a desert needs rain  
Like a town needs a name  
I need your love  
  
Like a drifter needs a room  
Hawkmoon  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Like a rhythm unbroken  
Like drums in the night  
Like sweet soul music  
Like sunlight  
I need your love  
  
Like coming home  
And you don't know where you've been  
Like black coffee  
Like nicotine  
I need your love (I need your love)  
I need your love (I need your love)  
I need your love (I need your love)  
  
When the night has no end  
And the day yet to begin  
As the room spins around  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Like a Phoenix rising needs a holy tree  
Like the sweet revenge of a bitter enemy  
I need your love  
  
Like the hot needs the sun  
Like honey on her tongue  
Like the muzzle of a gun  
Like oxygen  
I need your love (I need your love)  
I need your love (I need your love)  
I need your love (I need your love)  
  
When the night has no end  
And the day yet to begin  
As the room spins around  
I need your love  
  
I need your love...  
[Repeat 9 times]  
  
Like thunder needs rain  
Like a preacher needs pain  
Like tongues of flame  
Like a sheet stained  
I need your love  
I need your love  
  
Like a needle needs a vein  
Like someone to blame  
Like a thought unchained  
Like a runaway train  
I need your love  
  
I need your love...  
[Repeat 7 times]  
  
Like faith needs a doubt  
Like a freeway out  
I need your love  
  
Like powder needs a spark  
Like lies need the dark  
I need your love  
  
In the heart of the heat of the love  
In the heart of the heat of the love...  
[Repeat until end]

See the sun rise over her skin  
Don't change it  
See the sun rise over her skin  
Dawn changes everything  
Everything  
And the delta sun  
Burns bright and violet  
  
Mississippi and the cotton wool heat  
Sixty-six a highway speaks  
Of deserts dry  
Of cool green valleys  
Gold and silver veins  
Of the shining cities  
  
In this heartland  
In this heartland soil  
In this heartland  
Heaven knows this is a heartland  
Heartland...heartland  
  
See the sun rise over her skin  
She feels like water in my hand  
Freeway like a river cuts through this land  
Into the side of love  
Like a burning spear  
And the poison rain  
Brings a flood of fear  
Through the ghost-ranch hills  
Death valley waters  
In the towers of steel  
Belief goes on and on  
  
In this heartland  
In this heartland soil  
In this heartland  
Heaven knows this is a heartland  
Heartland...heaven knows this is a heartland  
Heartland...heartland  
Heartland...heaven's day here in the heartland  
Heart...

Once you get a chance  
You come to baby  
Right back, you call me down  
Used to think you wanted nothing to do  
Was to say nothing at all  
You went like the one time  
A two time  
You're back, and me  
Drop off the back seat  
Of a bad car  
Where finders  
Came alone  
"F"  
Wishing her out of my life  
Wishing her...  
What am I to do  
Came a talk to street  
And a time that you listen  
Don't you beg the time on me  
They said you oughta call her back  
I want to, but afraid to say  
I won't hang up on you baby, child  
Nothing feels like this before  
Here in in my life  
Yeah in heaven and hell  
Baby you're heaven and hell  
Heaven and hell  
"F"  
Oh, heaven and hell  
All the time...  
Want a chance to hold you  
Want a chance to kill  
I want a chance to keep you awake at night  
When the sunlight burns through your love  
But you can't always get  
Everything you want  
You take cards from all under the table  
You're heaven, heaven and hell  
Baby you're heaven...heaven and hell  
Yeah, you're heaven...heaven and hell  
Cover me  
"E!"  
"Okay organ. Just organ."  
Darkness  
You light up my darkness  
You light up my darkness  
And open up  
"F"  
"Organ."  
"This time when we come in, come in a little bit quietly. Not the drums, but
everyone else."  
Heaven

(This is a song Charles Manson stole from the Beatles. We're stealing it
back.)  
When you get to the bottom  
You go back to the top of the slide  
And you stop and you turn  
And you go for a ride  
Then you get to the bottom  
Then you see me again  
  
Do you, don't you want me to love you  
Coming down fast I'm right here above you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
Ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Do you, don't you want me to make you  
I'm coming down fast now don't let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You ain't no lover but you ain't no dancer  
  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
When you get to the bottom

Helter skelter

Julie says  
John I'm getting nowhere  
I wrote this letter  
Hope to get to someplace soon  
I want to get up  
When I wake up  
But when I get up  
I fall down  
  
Julie wake up  
Julie tell the story  
You wrote the letter  
Said you were gonna get there someday  
Gonna walk in the sun  
And the wind and the rain  
Never walk back again  
  
Now you fall down  
You're falling down  
You fall down  
You fall down  
  
Julie say something  
Julie say you're sorry  
You're gonna get better  
You better not leave me here anyway  
  
I want to get up  
When you wake up  
When I get up  
  
I fall down  
When I'm falling down  
I fall down  
I broke myself  
  
I fall  
I fall down  
I'm falling down  
I fall down  
When you fall down  
When I'm falling down  
Is when you're falling down  
When you fall down  
I fall down  
I fall down...

I have climbed the highest mountains  
I have run through the fields  
Only to be with you  
Only to be with you.  
  
I have run, I have crawled  
I have scaled these city walls  
These city walls  
Only to be with you.  
  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.  
  
I have kissed honey lips  
Felt the healing in her finger tips  
It burned like fire  
A burning desire.  
  
I have spoke with the tongue of angels  
I have held the hand of a devil  
It was warm in the night  
I was cold as a stone.  
  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.  
  
I believe in the Kingdom Come  
Then all the colours will bleed into one  
Bleed into one.  
But yes, I'm still running.  
  
You broke the bonds  
And you loosed the chains  
Carried the cross of my shame  
Oh my shame, you know I believe it.  
  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.  
  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.  
But I still haven't found  
What I'm looking for.

I was talking  
I was talking to myself  
Somebody else  
Talk talk talking  
I couldn't hear a word  
A word you said  
  
He was my brother  
I said there was no other  
Way out of here  
Be my brother  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out  
  
I was walking  
I was walking into walls  
I'm back again  
I just keep walking  
I walk into a window  
To see myself  
And my reflection  
When I thought about it  
My direction  
Going nowhere  
Going nowhere  
  
No one...no one is blinder  
Than he who will not see  
No one...no one is blinder  
Than me  
  
I was talking  
I was talking in my sleep  
I can't stop talking  
I'm talking to you  
It's up to you  
  
Be my brother  
There is another way out of here  
In my brother  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out  
Gotta get out of here

Yeah  
  
Desert sky  
Dream beneath a desert sky  
The rivers run but soon run dry  
We need new dreams tonight  
  
Desert rose  
Dreamed I saw a desert rose  
Dress torn in ribbons and in bows  
Like a siren she calls to me  
  
Sleep comes like a drug  
In God's country  
Sad eyes, crooked crosses  
In God's country  
  
Set me alight  
We'll punch a hole right through the night  
Everyday the dreamers die  
See what's on the other side  
  
She is liberty  
And she comes to rescue me  
Hope, faith, her vanity  
The greatest gift is gold  
  
Sleep comes like a drug  
In God's country  
Sad eyes, crooked crosses  
In God's country  
  
Naked flame  
She stands with a naked flame  
I stand with the sons of Cain  
Burned by the fire of love  
Burned by the fire of love

Instant karma's gonna get you  
Gonna knock you right on the head  
You better get yourself together  
Pretty soon you're gonna be dead  
What in the world you thinking of  
Laughing in the face of love  
What on earth you tryin' to do  
It's up to you, yeah you  
  
Instant karmas gonna get you  
Gonna look you right in the face  
Better get yourself together darlin'  
Join the human race  
How in the world you gonna see  
Laughin' at fools like me  
What on earth do you think you are  
A super star  
Well, right you are  
  
Well we all shine on  
Like the moon and the stars and the sun  
Well we all shine on  
On and on and on  
  
Instant karmas gonna get you  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
Better recognize your brothers  
Everyone that you meet  
Why in the world are we here  
Surely not to live in pain and fear  
Why on earth are you there  
When you're everywhere  
Come get your share  
  
Well we all shine on  
Like the moon and the stars and the sun  
Yeah we all shine on  
On and on and on and on  
  
Well we all shine on  
Like the moon and the stars and the sun  
Yeah we all shine on  
Come on and on and on and on  
  
Shine on  
Shine on  
Shine on  
Come on and on and on and on

I have got you under my skin  
I've got you deep in the heart of me  
  
So deep in my heart  
You're nearly a part of me  
I've got you under my skin  
  
I have tried so not to give in  
I have said to myself this affair  
Never gonna go somewhere  
  
But why should I try to resist  
When baby I know so well  
That I've got you under my skin  
  
I would sacrifice anything  
Come what might  
For the sake of holding you near  
In spite of a warning voice  
That comes in the night  
It repeats and it shouts in my ear  
  
Don't you know blue-eyes  
You never can win  
Use your mentality  
Wake up to reality  
  
But each time I do  
Just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
  
Cause I've got you under my skin  
I'd sacrifice anything  
Come what might  
For the sake of having you near  
In spite of a warning voice  
That comes in the night  
It repeats and it shouts in my ear  
  
Don't you know you old fool  
You never can win  
Use your mentality  
Wake up to reality  
  
But each time that I do  
Just the thought of you  
Makes me stop before I begin  
  
Cause I've got you under my skin  
And I love you (when you're) under my skin

One, two, three, four  
  
Well Jesus was a man  
Who traveled through the land  
A hard working man and brave  
Well he said to the rich 'Give your money to the poor'  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ is his grave  
  
Well he went to the preacher  
He went to the law  
And told them all the same  
He said sell all your jewelery and give it to the poor  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
When Jesus came to town all the working folks around  
Believed what he did say  
Well the bankers and the preachers  
They nailed him on a cross  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
And [hard] working people  
They followed him around  
They sung and shouted gay  
Well the cops and the soldiers  
They nailed him in the head  
And they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Oh, hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
  
Well this song was written in New York City  
A rich man, preacher and slave  
Well if Jesus was to preach what he preached in Galilee  
They would lay Jesus Christ in his grave  
One, two, three, four!  
  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
Hale, hallelujah  
For they laid Jesus Christ in his grave

Something is about to give  
I can feel it coming  
I think I know what it means  
I'm not afraid to die  
I'm not afraid to live  
And when I'm flat on my back  
I hope to feel like I did  
  
'Cause hardness, it sets in  
You need some protection  
The thinner the skin  
  
I want you to know  
That you don't need me anymore  
I want you to know  
You don't need me anyone, anything at all  
  
Who's' to say when the wind will take you  
Who's to know what it is will break you  
I don't know which way the wind will blow  
Who's to know when the time's come around  
Don't want to see you cry  
I know that this is not goodbye  
  
In summer I can taste the salt in the sea  
There's a kite blowing out of control on a breeze  
I wonder what's gonna happen to you  
You wonder what has happened to me  
  
I'm a man, I'm not a child  
A man who sees  
The shadow behind your eyes  
  
Who's' to say when the wind will take you  
Who's to know what it is will break you  
I don't know which way the wind will blow  
Who's to know when the time's come around  
Don't want to see you cry  
I know that this is not goodbye  
  
Did I waste it?  
Not so much I couldn't taste it  
Life should be fragrant  
Roof top to the basement  
The last of the rock stars  
When hip hop drives the big cars  
In the mean time when new media  
Was the big idea

Like a song I have to sing  
I sing it for you.  
Like the words I have to bring  
I bring it for you.  
  
And in leather, lace and chains we stake our claim.  
Revolution once again  
No I won't, I won't wear it on my sleeve.  
I can see through this expression and you know I don't believe.  
Too old to be told, exactly who are you?  
Tonight, tomorrow's too late.  
  
And we love to wear a badge, a uniform  
And we love to fly a flag  
But I won't let others live in hell  
As we divide against each other  
And we fight amongst ourselves  
Too set in our ways to try to rearrange  
Too right to be wrong, in this rebel song  
Let the bells ring out  
Let the bells ring out  
Is there nothing left?  
Is there, is there nothing?  
Is there nothing left?  
Is honesty what you want?  
  
A generation without name, ripped and torn  
Nothing to lose, nothing to gain  
Nothing at all  
And if you can't help yourself  
Well take a look around you  
When others need your time  
You say it's time to go... it's your time.  
Angry words won't stop the fight  
Two wrongs won't make it right.  
A new heart is what I need.  
Oh, God make it bleed.  
Is there nothing left?

Lay down  
Lay down  
Lay your sweet lovely on the ground  
Lay your love on the track  
We're gonna break the monster's back  
Yes we are...  
Lay down your treasure  
Lay it down now brother  
You don't have time  
For a jealous lover  
  
As you enter this life  
I pray you depart  
With a wrinkled face  
And a brand new heart  
  
I don't know if I can take it  
I'm not easy on my knees  
Here's my heart you can break it  
  
I need some release, release, release  
  
We need  
Love and peace  
Love and peace  
  
Lay down  
Lay down your guns  
All your daughters of Zion  
All your Abraham sons  
  
I don't know if I can make it  
I'm not easy on my knees  
Here's my heart and you can break it  
I need some release, release, release  
  
We need  
Love and peace  
Love and peace  
  
Baby don't fight  
We can talk this thing through  
It's not a big problem  
It's just me and you  
You can call or I'll phone  
The TV is still on  
But the sound is turned down  
And the troops on the ground  
Are about to dig in  
  
And I wonder where is the love?  
Where is the love?  
Where is the love?  
Where is the love?  
Love and peace

Love don't need to find a way  
You find your own way  
I forget that I can't stay  
And so I say that  
All roads lead to where you are  
All roads lead to where you are  
  
The seed is spilled, the bed defiled  
For you, a virgin bride  
Hide yourself in someone else  
Don't find yourself in me  
  
I can't lift you up again  
Love comes tumbling down again  
  
Love don't need to find a way  
You find your own way  
I forget that you can stay  
And so I say that  
All roads lead to where you are  
All roads lead to where you are

Love is blindness  
I don't want to see  
Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my heart  
Love is blindness  
  
In a parked car  
In a crowded street  
You see your love  
Made complete  
Thread is ripping  
The knot is slipping  
Love is blindness  
  
Love is clockworks  
And cold steel  
Fingers too numb to feel  
Squeeze the handle  
Blow out the candle  
Love is blindness  
  
Love is blindness  
I don't want to see  
Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my love  
Blindness  
  
A little death  
Without mourning  
No call  
And no warning  
Baby, a dangerous idea  
That almost makes sense  
  
Love is drowning  
In a deep well  
All the secrets  
And no one to tell  
Take the money  
Honey  
Blindness  
  
Love is blindness  
I don't want to see  
Won't you wrap the night  
Around me?  
Oh my love  
Blindness

Weather 'round here choppin' and changin'  
Surgery in the air  
Print shirts and southern accents  
Cigars and big hair  
We got the wheels and petrol is cheap  
Only went there for a week  
Git the sun got the sand  
Got the batteries in the handy cam  
Her eyes all swimming pool blue  
Dumb bells on a diving board  
Baby's always attracted to the things she's afraid of  
Big girl with the sweet tooth  
Watches the skinny girl in the photo shoot  
Freshmen squeaky clean  
She tastes of chlorine  
  
Miami  
My mammy  
  
Love the movies  
Love to walk those movie sets  
Get to shoot someone in the foot  
Get to smoke some cigarettes  
No big deal we know the score  
Just back from the video store  
Got the car and the car chase  
What's he got inside the case  
I want a close up of that face  
Here comes the car chase  
  
Miami  
My mammy  
Miami  
  
I bought two new suits  
Miami  
Pink and blue  
Miami  
I took a picture of you  
My mammy  
Getting hot in a photo booth  
Miami  
I said you looked like a madonna  
You said maybe  
Said I want to have your baby  
Baby  
Baby  
We could make something beautiful  
Something that wouldn't be a problem  
At least not in  
Miami  
Some places are like your auntie  
But there's no place like  
  
Miami  
My mammy  
  
Miami  
  
Miami

I want to trip inside your head  
Spend the day there  
To hear the things you haven't said  
And see what you might see  
  
I want to hear you when you call  
Do you feel anything at all?  
I want to see your thoughts take shape  
And walk right out  
  
Freedom has a scent  
Like the top of a new born baby's head  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
I've seen enough, I'm not giving up  
On a miracle drug  
  
Of science and the human heart  
There is no limit  
There is no failure here sweetheart  
Just when you quit  
  
I am you and you are mine  
Love makes nonsense of space  
And time, will disappear  
Love and logic keep us clear  
Reason is on our side, love  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
I've had enough of romantic love  
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up  
For a miracle, a miracle drug, a miracle drug  
  
God I need your help tonight  
  
Beneath the noise  
Below the din  
I hear your voice  
It's whispering  
In science and in medicine  
"I was a stranger  
You took me in"  
  
The songs are in your eyes  
I see them when you smile  
I've had enough of romantic love  
I'd give it up, yeah, I'd give it up  
For a miracle, miracle drug  
  
Miracle, miracle drug

I tied myself with wire  
To let the horses run free  
Playing with the fire  
Until the fire played with me  
  
The stone was semi precious  
We were barely conscious  
Two souls too smart to be  
In the realm of certainty  
Even on our wedding day  
  
We set ourselves on fire  
A girl could not deny her  
Its not if I believe in love  
If love believes in me  
Oh believe in me  
  
[Chorus]  
At the moment of surrender  
I'm falling to my knees  
I did not notice the passers by  
And they did not notice me  
  
I've been in every black hole  
At the alter of a Dark star  
My body s now begging  
Though it's begging to get back  
Begging to get back  
To my heart  
To the rhythm of my soul  
To the rhythm of my consciousness  
To the rhythm of yes  
To be released from control  
  
I was punching in the numbers at the ATM machine  
I could see in the reflection  
A face staring back at me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I was speeding off the subway  
Through the stations of the cross  
Every eye looking every other way  
Counting down till the pain will stop  
  
[Chorus]

Midnight, our sons and daughters  
Cut down, taken from us  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
In the wind we hear their laughter  
In the rain we see their tears  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
Night hangs like a prisoner  
Stretched over black and blue  
Hear their heartbeat  
We hear their heartbeat  
  
In the trees our sons stand naked  
Through the walls our daughters cry  
See their tears in the rainfall

We turn away to face the cold, enduring chill  
As the day begs the night for mercy love  
The sun so bright it leaves no shadows  
Only scars carved into stone  
On the face of earth  
The moon is up and over One Tree Hill  
We see the sun go down in your eyes  
  
You run like river, on like a sea  
You run like a river runs to the sea  
  
And in the world a heart of darkness  
A fire zone  
Where poets speak their heart  
Then bleed for it  
Jara sang, his song a weapon  
In the hands of love  
You know his blood still cries  
From the ground  
  
It runs like a river runs to the sea  
It runs like a river to the sea  
  
I don't believe in painted roses  
Or bleeding hearts  
While bullets rape the night of the merciful  
I'll see you again  
When the stars fall from the sky  
And the moon has turned red  
Over One Tree Hill  
  
We run like a river  
Run to the sea  
We run like a river to the sea  
And when it's raining  
Raining hard  
That's when the rain will  
Break my heart  
  
Raining...raining in the heart  
Raining in your heart  
Raining...raining to your heart  
Raining, raining...raining  
Raining to your heart  
Raining...raining in your heart  
Raining in your heart..  
To the sea  
  
Oh great ocean  
Oh great sea  
Run to the ocean  
Run to the sea

I see a red door  
And I want to paint it black  
No colors anymore  
I want them to turn black  
I see the girls walk by  
Dressed in their summer clothes  
I have to turn my head  
Until my darkness goes  
I see a line of cars  
And they're all painted black  
With flowers and my love  
Both never to come back  
I people turn their heads  
And quickly look away  
Like a newborn baby  
It just happens everyday  
I look inside myself  
See my heart is black  
I see my red door  
And I wanna paint it black  
Maybe then I'll fade away  
Not have to face the facts  
It's not easy facing up  
When your whole world is black  
No more will my green sea  
Will turn a deeper blue  
I could not foresee  
This thing happening to you  
If I look hard enough  
Into the setting sun  
My love will laugh with me  
Before the morning comes  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as night  
Want to see it painted  
Painted black, black as coal  
...  

I know a girl, a girl called Party  
Party girl  
I know she wants more than a party  
Party girl  
And she won't tell me her name  
Oh no, not me  
  
I know a boy, a boy called Trash  
Trash Can  
I know he does all that he can  
Wham Bam  
And she won't tell me his name  
Oh no, not me  
  
When I was three, I thought the world revolved around me  
I was wrong  
And so I sing along  
And if you dance, then dance with me  
  
I know a girl, a girl called Party  
Party girl  
I know she wants more than a party  
Party girl  
I know a boy, a boy called Trampoline  
You know what I mean  
  
I think I know what he wants  
I think I know what he wants  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what you want  
I think I know what he wants

Heaven on earth  
We need it now  
I'm sick of all of this  
Hanging around  
Sick of sorrow  
Sick of pain  
Sick of hearing again and again  
That there's gonna be  
Peace on earth  
  
Where I grew up  
There weren't many trees  
Where there was we'd tear them down  
And use them on our enemies  
They say that what you mock  
Will surely overtake you  
And you become a monster  
So the monster will not break you  
  
It's already gone too far  
Who said if you go in hard  
You won't get hurt  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
No who's or whys  
No-one cries like a mother cries  
For peace on earth  
She never got to say goodbye  
To see the color in his eyes  
Now he's in the dirt  
That's peace on earth  
  
They're reading names out over the radio  
All the folks the rest of us won't get to know  
Sean and Julia, Gareth, Ann and Brenda  
Their lives are bigger, than any big idea  
  
Jesus could you take the time  
To throw a drowning man a line  
Peace on earth  
Tell the ones who hear no sound  
Whose sons are living in the ground  
Peace on earth  
  
Jesus this song you wrote  
The words are sticking in my throat  
Peace on earth  
Hear it every Christmas time  
But hope and history won't rhyme  
So what's it worth?  
This peace on earth  
  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth  
Peace on earth

And so she woke up  
Woke up from where she was  
Lying still  
Said I gotta do something  
About where we're going  
  
Step on a steam train  
Step out of the driving rain, maybe  
Run from the darkness in the night  
Singing ha, ah la la la de day  
Ah da da da de day  
Ah la la de day  
  
Sweet the sin  
Bitter the taste in my mouth  
I see seven towers  
But I only see one way out  
  
You got to cry without weeping  
Talk without speaking  
Scream without raising your voice  
  
You know I took the poison  
From the poison stream  
Then I floated out of here  
Singing ha la la la de day  
Ha la la la de day  
Ha la la de day  
  
She runs through the streets  
With eyes painted red  
Under a black belly of cloud in the rain  
In through a doorway she brings me  
White gold and pearls stolen from the sea  
She is raging  
She is raging  
And the storm blows up in her eyes  
She will  
  
Suffer the needle chill  
She's running to stand  
  
Still.

Baby please  
Baby please don't go  
I got lies to feed  
They want skin and seed  
And don't make me crawl  
  
Please  
Baby don't bite your lip  
Give you half what I got  
If you untie the knot  
It's a promise  
  
Salome...salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
  
Baby please  
Baby what's that tune  
Well I heard it before  
When I crawled from your door  
And my blood turned blue  
  
Please  
Baby please slow down  
Baby I feel sick  
Don't make me stick to my promise  
  
Salome...salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
  
Baby please  
Baby don't say no  
Won't you dance for me  
Under the cherry tree  
Won't you swing down low  
  
Please  
Baby please say yes  
Baby don't go away  
You're spilling me  
And your precious love  
  
Salome...salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome  
Salome...shake it shake it shake it salome

Takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh  
It takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh, say bye bye  
Where you going to now  
  
Lightning flashes across the sky  
East to west, do or die  
Like a thief in the night  
See the world by candlelight.  
  
Fall, rise and fall, rise and  
  
In an apartment on Time Square  
You can assemble them anywhere  
Held to ransom, hell to pay  
A revolution everyday  
USSR, GDR, London, New York, Peking  
It's the puppets, It's the puppets  
Who pull the strings  
  
Fall, rise and fall, rise and  
  
Say goodbye, say goodbye  
Say goodbye, say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
  
It takes a second to say goodbye  
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh  
Push the button and pull the plug  
Say goodbye, oh, oh, oh  
  
Fall, rise and fall, rise and  
  
And they're doing the atomic bomb  
Do they know where the dance comes from  
Yes they're doing the atomic bomb  
They want you to sing along  
Say goodbye, say goodbye  
Say goodbye  
Say goodbye.

Back to the cold restless streets at night  
I talk to myself about tomorrow night  
Walls of white protest  
A gravestone in name  
Who is it now  
It's always the same  
  
Who is it now  
Who calls me inside  
Are the leaves on the trees  
Just living disguise  
I walk sweet rain tragicomedy  
I'll walk home again  
To the street melody  
  
But I know, oh no  
But I know, oh no  
But I know  
  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
Shadows and tall trees  
  
Life through a window  
Discolored pain  
Mrs. Brown's washing is always the same  
I walk street rain tragicomedy  
I'll walk home again  
To the street melody  
  
But I know, oh no  
But I know, oh no  
But I know  
  
(Out there)  
  
Do you feel in me  
Anything redeeming  
Any worthwhile feeling  
Is love like a tightrope  
Hanging from the ceiling  
  
But I know, oh no  
But I know, oh no  
But I know  
  
Shadows and tall trees

In the shit house a shotgun  
Praying hands hold me down  
Only the hunter was hunted  
In this tin can town  
Tin can town  
  
No stars in the black night  
Looks like the sky fell down  
No sun in the daylight  
Looks like it's chained to the ground  
Chained to the ground  
The warden said  
The exit is sold  
If you want a way out  
Silver and gold  
  
Broken back to the ceiling  
Broken nose to the floor  
I scream at the silence, it's crawling  
It crawls under the door  
There's a rope around my neck  
And there's a trigger in your gun  
Jesus say something  
I am someone, I am someone  
I am someone  
  
Captain and kings  
In the ships hold  
They came to collect  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
  
Seen the coming and going  
Seen them captains and the kings  
See them navy blue uniforms  
See them bright and shiny things  
Bright shiny things  
  
The temperature is rising  
The fever white hot  
Mister, I ain't got nothing  
But it's more than you got  
  
Chains no longer bind me  
Not the shackles at my feet  
Outside are the prisoners  
Inside the free  
Set them free  
Set them free  
  
A prize fighter in a corner is told  
Hit where it hurts  
Silver and gold  
Silver and gold  
  
[spoken part follows:]  
  
Yep, silver and gold... This song was written in a hotel room in New York city
'round about the time a friend or ours, Little Steven, was putting together a
record of artists against apartheid. This is a song written about a man in a
shanty town outside of Johannesburg. A man who's sick of looking down the
barrel of white South Africa. A man who is at the point where he is ready to
take up arms against his oppressor. A man who has lost faith in the
peacemakers of the west while they argue and while they fail to support a man
like bishop Tutu and his request for economic sanctions against South Africa.  
  
Am I buggin' you? I don't mean to bug ya...  
  
Okay Edge, play the blues...

We crossed the line  
Who pushed who over?  
It doesn't matter to you  
It matters to me  
  
We're cut adrift  
We're still floating  
I'm only hanging on  
To watch you go down  
My love  
  
I disappeared in you  
You disappeared from me  
I gave you everything you ever wanted  
It wasn't what you wanted  
  
The men who love you, you hate the most  
They pass through you like a ghost  
They look for you, but your spirit is in the air  
Baby, you're nowhere  
  
Oh...love...  
You say in love there are no rules  
Oh...love...  
Sweetheart,  
You're so cruel  
  
Desperation is a tender trap  
It gets you every time  
You put your lips to her lips  
To stop the lie  
  
Her skin is pale like God's only dove  
Screams like an angel for your love  
Then she makes you watch her from above  
And you need her like a drug  
  
Oh...love...  
You say in love there are no rules  
Oh...love...  
Sweetheart,  
You're so cruel  
  
She wears my love like a see-through dress  
Her lips say one thing  
Her movements something else  
Oh love, like a screaming flower  
Love...dying every hour...love  
  
You don't know if it's fear or desire  
Danger the drug that takes you higher  
Head in heaven, fingers in the mire  
  
Her heart is racing, you can't keep up  
The night is bleeding like a cut  
Between the horses of love and lust  
We are trampled underfoot  
  
Oh...love... You say in love there are no rules  
Oh...love...  
Sweetheart,  
You're so cruel  
  
Oh...love...  
To stay with you I'd be a fool  
Sweetheart  
You're so cruel

Some days are dry, some days are leaky  
Some days come clean, other days are sneaky  
Some days take less, but most days take more  
Some slip through your fingers and onto the floor  
  
Some days you're quick, but most days you're speedy  
Some days you use more force than is necessary  
Some days just drop in on us  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days it all adds up  
And what you got is not enough  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are slippy, other days sloppy  
Some days you can't stand the sight of a puppy  
Your skin is white but you think you're a brother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you wake up with her complaining  
Some sunny days you wish it was raining  
Some days are sulky, some days have a grin  
And some days have bouncers and won't let you in  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days are honest, some days are not  
Some days you're thankful for what you've got  
Some days you wake up in the army  
And some days it's the enemy  
  
Some days are work, most days you're lazy  
Some days you feel like a bit of a baby  
Lookin' for Jesus and His mother  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you feel ahead  
You're making sense of what she said  
Some days are better than others  
  
Some days you hear a voice  
Taking you to another place  
Some days are better than others

Wey hey hey, baby hang on  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on  
Empty heart, beat tight as a drum set  
Empty love, she'd shine like a song  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on (to anything)  
  
Our love shines like rain  
In those Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes  
  
Wey hey hey, here she comes  
She comes in colors  
You know she gonna turn the daylight on  
'Cause I love the way you talk to me  
And I love the way you walk on me  
And I need you more  
Oh, than you need me  
  
Our love shines like rain  
In those Spanish eyes  
Spanish eyes  
  
I'll cross the world for green and gold  
But it's those Spanish eyes  
That get me home...home again  
  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on  
Wey hey hey, you know that  
The night is young  
Dazzled by lights that shine in your eyes  
I'm standing in the shadows  
And wait for the night  
Forever in fever, forever in heat  
You pick me up to put me out on the street  
  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on  
Wey hey hey, baby hang on, hang on  
'Cause I love the way you talk to me  
And I love the way you're mean to me  
And I need you

Oh, the city's alight  
With lovers and lies  
Bright blue eyes  
Oh, the city is bright  
It's brighter than day tonight  
  
Surrender, Surrender  
Surrender, Surrender  
  
Sadie said she couldn't work out  
What it was all about  
And so she let go  
Now Sadie's on the street  
And the people she meets you know  
She tried to be a good girl and a good wife  
Raise a good family  
Lead a good life  
It's not good enough  
She got herself up on the 48th floor  
Gotta find out  
Find out what she's living for  
  
Surrender, Surrender  
Surrender, Surrender  
  
Tonight...  
  
Oh, the city's afire  
A passionate flame  
It knows me by name  
Oh, the city's desire  
To take me for more and more  
It's in the street, getting under my feet  
It's in the air, it's everywhere  
My love for you  
It's in the things I do and say  
If I want to live I gotta  
Die to myself someday  
  
Papa sing my sing my sing my song  
Papa sing my sing my sing my song...

Oh, baby child...  
  
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
It's no secret that our world is in darkness tonight  
They say the sun is sometimes eclipsed by a moon  
You know I don't see you when she walks in the room  
  
It's no secret that a friend is someone who lets you help  
It's no secret that a liar won't believe anyone else  
They say a secret is something you tell one other person  
So I'm telling you, child  
  
A man will beg  
A man will crawl  
On the sheer face of love  
Like a fly on a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
It's no secret that a conscience can sometimes be a pest  
It's no secret ambition bites the nails of success  
Every artist is a cannibal, every poet is a thief  
All kill their inspiration and sing about their grief  
  
Over love...  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
Love...we shine like a  
Burning star  
We're falling from the sky  
Tonight  
  
A man will rise  
A man will fall  
From the sheer face of love  
Like a fly from a wall  
It's no secret at all  
  
Oh, yeah!  
It's no secret that the stars are falling from the sky  
The universe exploded 'cause of one man's lie  
Look, I gotta go, yeah I'm running outta change  
There's a lot of things, if I could I'd rearrange

Alive in an ocean  
A world that I didn't see  
I walk the world back ways  
It's aways the same ballgame  
  
That's out of mind  
Out of the living world  
Out of time  
I break all the rules  
  
They call me a fool  
I cartoon in motion  
A hero pretends no pain  
A clown slipping backwards  
  
You laugh at another's shame  
But I don't mind  
I know I'm limping low down  
I don't mind  
  
Winners or losers  
It's all just a game  
And I'm going down  
And I'm strolling down  
  
Life and an answer  
The key to an open door  
Admitting I'm laughing  
Living I'm limping more  
  
It's out of mind  
Out of the living world  
Out of time  
Winners or losers  
  
It's always a game  
And I'm going down  
But I'm strolling down  
To rout around  
  
And around, and around  
To round round  
There's a cloud  
There's a cloud  
  
So the fool has found the golden key  
So it's waiting there for you and me  
Just a fool, a street jester  
The hero of society  
  
Just a fool, a street jester  
Look at me, now can't you see  
A life in emotion  
A world I'm glad I didn't see  
  
A cartoon in motion  
A key to the same day  
I don't mind, I'm here to know  
I want to go go go go go  
  
So the fool has found the golden key  
It's so it's waiting there for you and me  
Just a fool, a street jester  
The hero of society  
  
Just a fool, a street jester  
Look at me, now can't you see

All my life, I worshiped her  
Her golden voice, her beauty's beat  
How she made us feel, how she made me real  
And the ground beneath her feet  
And the ground beneath her feet  
  
And now I can't be sure of anything  
Black is white, and cold is heat  
For what I worshiped, stole my love away  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
It was the ground beneath her feet  
  
Go lightly down your darkened way  
Go lightly underground  
I'll be down there in another day  
I won't rest until you're found  
  
Let me love you, let me rescue you,  
Let me bring you where two roads meet  
Oh come back above, where there is only love  
Only love  
  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
  
Let me love you true, let me rescue you,  
Let me bring you to where two roads meet  
  
Let me love you true, let me rescue you,  
Let me bring you to where two roads meet  
  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my  
My oh my, my oh my
