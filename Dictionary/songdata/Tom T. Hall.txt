My little girl and I lost Mama just three years ago  
And now that she is older there are things she wants to know  
She said, "Please Daddy tell me 'bout my mother 'cause I miss her."  
I said, "Get pen and paper and I'll help your draw her picture."  
I said, "First draw a heart so big there's room for little else  
Then write a million for the things that she denied herself  
Draw a rose the kind of which there'll never be another  
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother  
"If you want to make the picture even more complete  
You could draw a little cottage, draw it nice and neat  
Draw a bright and shining sun up in the sky above  
But then again I guess its pretty hard to draw my love  
"So draw a heart so big that there is room for little else  
Write a million for the things that she denied herself  
Draw a rose the kind of which there'll never be another  
And when you finish you will have a picture of your mother."

One time I spent a week inside a little country jail  
And I don't guess I'll ever live it down  
I was sittin' at a red light when these two men came and got me  
And said that I was speeding through their town  
  
Well, they said,tomorrow morning you can see the judge then go.  
They let me call one person on the phone  
I thought I'd be there overnight so I just called my boss  
To tell him I'd be off but not for long  
  
Well, they motioned me inside a cell with seven other guys  
One little barred up window in the rear  
My cellmates said if they had let me bring some money in  
We ought to send the jailer for some beer  
  
Well, I had to pay him double 'cause he was the man in charge  
And the jailer's job was not the best in town  
Later on his wife brought hot bologna, eggs and gravy  
The first day I was there I turned it down  
  
Well, next morning they just let us sleep but I was up real early  
Wonderin' when I'd get my release  
Later on we got more hot bologna, eggs and gravy  
And by now I wasn't quite so hard to please  
  
Two days later when I thought that I had been forgotten  
The sheriff came in chewin' on a straw  
He said, where is the guy who thinks that this is indianapolis?  
I'd like to talk to him about the law.  
Well, I told him who I was and told him I was working steady  
And I really should be gettin' on my way  
That part about me bein' who I was did not impress him  
He said, the judge'll be here any day.  
  
The jailer had a wife and let me tell you she was awful  
But she brought that hot bologna every day  
And after seven days she got to lookin' so much better  
I asked her if she'd like to run away  
  
The next mornin' that old judge took every nickel that I had  
And he said, son, let this teach you not to race.  
The jailer's wife was smilin' from the window as I left  
In thirty minutes I was out of state

I'm sittin' here lookin' at some mighty hard times money ain't growing on
trees  
A little while ago I was rollin' in dough singin' all you want when you please  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please  
The wind blows up this road all summer in the evening it cools one and all  
  
If you like a good breeze you can have all you please  
If you don't get blown away in the fall  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please  
  
My money's all gone and my breeze died down my bloom of youth's gone to seed  
I sit here and cry for the days all gone by when I sang all you want when you
please  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please  
Well the meat's all lean and the bread's all done  
  
And the cook rides a big white horse  
You just come like you look and if you get your picture took  
You can tell 'em you was at the Mardi Gras  
All you want when you please girls all you want when you please

There was a man came to see the USA from a foreign land  
To photograph the progress of dear old Uncle Sam  
He got off the boat in New York went down to the Bowery  
I know what the man went to photograph and to see  
  
There were hopeless hungry living dead  
Winos who sell their souls for a bottle of a cheapest red  
That's the picture that he wanted  
And that's what he got they say America the ugly today  
  
He went to the Appalachians and he saw what we all have seen  
Where people live on bread and soup fat back and pinto beans  
He saw the hungry children and he photographed the ragged clothes  
I guess we're gonna try to tell him that it ain't so  
  
There were good men standin' around with nothing to do  
Pregnant young women who didn't even have a pair of shoes  
The man got his pictures and what are we going to say America the ugly today  
  
Then he went to the medicare centers and he saw the old people there  
It seems that the young generation just didn't want 'em in their hair  
He saw the poor man workin' it out while the mighty rich lives high  
And my friend that brings a gleam to the enemy's eyes  
  
There were some folks had plenty and some had none at all  
The enemy knows when a heart gets hard the country is bound to fall  
If we get heads and hearts together we won't have to hear them say  
America the ugly today America the ugly today

And I love you so the people ask me how  
How I've lived till now I tell them I don't know  
I guess they understand how lonely life has been  
But life began again the day you took my hand  
And yes I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evenings get me down now that you're around me  
And you love me too your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free I'm happy that you do  
The book of life is brief and once the pages read all but life is dead that is
my belief  
And yes I know...  
And I love you so

Loving you was just a storybook of fair I've decided there ain't no real life
anywhere  
Soon I'll be a painted picture in the book of your mind  
Another town is somewhere down the line  
Another town another grocery store another town another set of swinging doors  
And somehow I'm a little bit suspicious in my mind  
It's another town that don't need my kind  
Tell your mama she was sure a dandy cook tell your papa that I understood his
looks  
If I put it all together you're a piece that wouldn't fit  
There's another town a comin' up I guess  
Another town another grocery store...  
As I leave you let me leave you with this thought  
Time is candy and we ate all that we bought  
And teardrops they're just wrappers on the ground  
That a new wind blows into another town  
Another town another grocery store..  
Another town another grocery store...

Well the children come back to see the old home-place  
They don't see a thing that they like  
The old well out back with its cool clear water don't fit into their style of
life  
The old gravel road that leads to the old home-place gets dust on their new
shiny cars  
Well they didn't complain about nothing to do back when the old home-place was
new  
Back when the old home-place was new there was plenty to see and to do  
But they can't remember and I ain't gonna tell 'em  
Back when the old home-place was new  
  
[Harmonica]  
  
There's an old swimming hole about a half mile away  
An old tire still swings from a tree  
I've got an old jar full of lightening and bugs and a dogfishin' weren't just
today  
They can't get on line from my old telephone and I ain't got no cable TV  
Oh we used to tell stories and some of them true  
Back when the old home-place was new  
Back when the old home-place...  
  
[Harmonica]  
  
Well the toys they treasured are stashed in the attic except for a rusty old
bike  
There's a big ball of string in a drawer in the kitchen  
They used to use flying their kites  
There's a battered old can out there by the tool-shed  
An old can that they used to kick  
They sit on the porch and they stare down the driveway  
They just can't see living like this  
Back when the old home-place...

Now I'd hear a lot of tall stories since my business is writin' songs  
And every now and then if you listen real close a good true one comes along  
And this is the story of old Bill Crump from the North Carolina Hills  
Nat Winston of Nashville knew this man real well  
He built the church and he built the pews  
He built the cradles and the furniture for the schools  
Folks in Avery County say that he was better than good  
Probably one of the reasons the Lord made wood  
Now men have faults and Bill's fault was he loved to sip that corn  
He lived ninety some years that way don't guess it was hurtin' him none  
You could take him a picture from a catalog he could build anything he'd see  
He could make anything that you could make out of the tree  
One day Bill said Mama I'm gettin' old I want you to measure me good  
I'm goin' out to that wood pile and get myself some wood  
And I'm gonna make me a coffin I want it to fit me fine  
The way I figure it I've got about enough time  
He built the church and he built the pews...  
Now Bill worked on that coffin like he was gonna be there awhile  
He'd show the folks and rub that wood and then stand back and smile  
He used that body for ninety some years figured it had treated him good  
And when he left it he put it away in some real fine wood  
Oh right now old Bill's sleepin' in the hills of North Caroline  
In his homemade coffin hand rubbed walnut velvet lined  
Now most folks use their heads and hands and just think of themselves  
His body's there but his spirit's someplace else  
'Cause he built the church and he built the pews...

[Chorus]  
The band played and everyone talked  
Through the plain old Beer Drinker's Waltz.  
  
Well, they sweated and swore, and they spit on the floor  
Where the cigarette butts were all thrown  
They wrote on the wall and hid out from the law  
And the whole gang was drunk drivin' home.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some little snuff queen who was barely sixteen  
Played an out of tune Yamaha guitar  
Some old boy named Wink who brought his own drinks  
Had his fiddle stoled out of his car.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The man tendin' bar told the boy on guitar  
He was a-drinkin' a little too much  
They announced on the mic that they left on the lights  
In a dark blue Chevrolet truck.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, somewhere in the heavens there's a seven-o-seven  
And they're a-servin' champagne in first class  
Somewhere upstairs a child says its prayers  
Oh, but downstairs they're havin' a blast.  
  
[Chorus]

This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time  
And for the people who have loved and some have been loved  
And some were wanted inside your walls  
And for the 22 year old college girl  
Who made that last semester with her smile along your halls  
And for the traveling salesman and the Friday night time dinner out time crowd  
Some were seeking stimulation in the laughter noise and drinks the music loud  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time  
  
And for the Wednesday Night Auxiliary that meets inside your banquet room at
nine  
For the women's club and the social leads and the regular attendants every
time  
For the lost abandoned child by your northside entrance left alone to die  
For the long haired wide eyed boy selling dope and looking for a place to hide  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time  
  
For the middle aged executive who thought he'd seen enough  
To slash his wrist in No 10  
And for the 32 year old housewife who got caught with her best friend's
husband  
She ain't around to try again  
For the 7 year old girl swingin' slidin' on the west side near the pool  
Saying why couldn't dad come home with us mama  
Why you got to put me in that school  
This song is for you big motel on the mountain just in thought to pass the
time

The words I love you come easy to the lips of a liar or a fool  
If love talking is what you're thinking of then do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love  
Some little things to let them know they're all you're thinking of  
This day and time a little thing you do could mean so much  
So do it to someone you love  
  
A smile comes easy to a strange hello to someone that you never met  
But an old love don't need that smile it glows with just a touch  
So do it to someone you love  
Do it to someone you love...

It snowed the night before and it had frozen on the ground  
We didn't have a car and we lived seven miles from town  
And I can hear my daddy's voice, so many years ago  
Saying  
"Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Mama needs her medicine, she's got that real bad cough  
We'll get our check on Monday, tell ol' Sam we'll pay him off  
You can catch a ride when you get to the black-top road  
Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"  
Me and Quentin went back on the hill and we cut some wood  
Burnin' in that ol' warm mornin' stove it sure smelled good  
Daddy couldn't get work then and I was just a child  
And God was on vacation for awhile  
"Well, if you see Fred you tell him I'll come help him kill them hogs  
And ask him if he'd still be interested in my dogs  
Don't hang around that pool room all day, we might get more snow  
And don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"  
Well, they wonder why there ain't no rabbits left this day and time  
To tell the truth I guess we ate 'em all in '49  
Was that yesterday or was it over 20 years ago  
"Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"  
"Mama needs her medicine, she's got that real bad cough  
We'll get our check on Monday tell ol' Sam we'll pay him off  
You can catch a ride when you get to the black-top road  
Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe  
Now pay attention, son  
Don't forget the coffee Billy Joe"  

Sometimes birds don't have enough to eat  
There's not enough food in the fields or the streets  
There are too many cities where there used to be trees so it's left up to you
and me  
Everybody loves to hear a bird sing (whistle)  
The prettiest music you have ever heard here's how to make friends with the
bird  
First you get some peanut butter out of a jar  
And you can buy a bag of bird seed anywhere  
You mix it all together and you put it on the ground  
And pretty soon the birds come around  
Everybody loves to hear...  
Some people buy spray and they spray it on the land  
They kill all the little bitty bugs that they can  
The birds eat up the bugs and it makes them sick I wish we didn't have to do
that  
Cause everybody loves to hear...  
Right now you're young and you're not very tall  
You're really very busy and you're rally very small  
Someday when you're older and things go wrong you've gotta need a pretty bird
song  
Because everybody loves to hear...

[Chorus]  
She walks through the corn leadin' down to the river  
Her hair shone like gold in the hot mornin' sun  
She took all the love that a poor boy could give her  
And left me to die like a fox on the run  
Like a fox, like a fox, like a fox on the run  
  
Now everybody knows the reason for my fall  
A woman tempted me down in paradise hall  
This woman tempted me and she took me for a ride  
Like a lonely fox, boys, i need a place to hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, we'll drink a glass of wine, boys, to purify our soul  
We'll talk about the world and the friends we used to know  
I see a string of girls who have put me on before  
The game is nearly over and the hounds are at the door  
  
[Chorus]

There's a place called Da Nang Village cross the ocean far away  
In deep concern for one young woman that's where I abide today  
Today I got a dear-John-letter from that young woman in the USA  
  
When I was called I knew I'd lose her it don't matter anyway  
There are girls in Saigon City waiting there with open arms  
On my leave I may go see them in this other world called VietNam  
  
Stateside girls should take this warning be faithful cause you can't tell  
On the streets of Saigon City they have many things to sell  
There are girls in Saigon City...

Goodbye cowgirl the trail ends here  
Goodbye cowgirl the tracks of all the dreams that we were chasin' disappear  
We take different trails I prefer the rails to some city lights where they're
civilized  
Goodbye cowgirl set your stirrups high  
Goodbye cowgirl you got to ride a many rough and dusty rocky mile  
I was the enemy in your camp you see I was restless nights by the campfire
light  
[ strings ]  
Goodbye cowgirl watch that western star  
Goodbye cowgirl ride around the mountains do not push yourself too far  
I will remember you what else could I do life's like rodeos open and they
close

There's a murderer in your town  
Mister there were seven unsolved last year  
There's a murderer in your town  
Mister how long has he been living here  
If they hang 'em all they get the guilty  
If they hang 'em all they cannot miss  
If they hang 'em all they get the guilty  
Been a lot of problem solved like this  
There's a thief in your town  
Mister this morning my milk was gone  
There's a thief in your town  
Mister how long has this been going on  
If they hang 'em all they get the guilty...  
There's a cheater in your town  
Mister last night I saw him in a bar  
There's a cheater in your town  
Mister is that the kind of people you are  
If they hang 'em all they get the guilty...  
There's a hypocrite in your town  
Mister I think I caught him in a lie  
There's a hypocrite in your town  
Mister are you gonna let that go by  
If they hang 'em all they get the guilty that's what you say we ought to do  
If they hang 'em all they get the guilty but remember they're gonna hang you
too  
If they hang 'em all they get the guilty...

I want to tell you all a story 'bout a Harper Valley widowed wife  
Who had a teenage daughter who attended Harper Valley Junior High  
Well her daughter came home one afternoon and didn't even stop to play  
She said, "Mom, I got a note here from the Harper Valley P.T.A."  
The note said, "Mrs. Johnson, you're wearing your dresses way too high  
It's reported you've been drinking and a-runnin' 'round with men and going
wild  
And we don't believe you ought to be bringing up your little girl this way"  
  
It was signed by the secretary, Harper Valley P.T.A.  
Well, it happened that the P.T.A. was gonna meet that very afternoon  
They were sure surprised when Mrs. Johnson wore her mini-skirt into the room  
And as she walked up to the blackboard, I still recall the words she had to
say  
She said, "I'd like to address this meeting of the Harper Valley P.T.A."  
Well, there's Bobby Taylor sittin' there and seven times he's asked me for a
date  
  
Mrs. Taylor sure seems to use a lot of ice whenever he's away  
And Mr. Baker, can you tell us why your secretary had to leave this town?  
And shouldn't widow Jones be told to keep her window shades all pulled
completely down?  
Well, Mr. Harper couldn't be here 'cause he stayed too long at Kelly's Bar
again  
And if you smell Shirley Thompson's breath, you'll find she's had a little nip
of gin  
  
Then you have the nerve to tell me you think that as a mother I'm not fit  
Well, this is just a little Peyton Place and you're all Harper Valley
hypocrites  
No I wouldn't put you on because it really did, it happened just this way  
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.  
The day my mama socked it to the Harper Valley P.T.A.

I was a high steppin' proud man one time king of the sidewalk fed all the
girls a line  
You came along and love laid a heavy hand on me  
High steppin' proud man went down to his knees  
For a while I enjoyed just bein' under your thumb  
But after a while the nerve of love grew numb  
Then I knew my heart was changing cryin' out long and loud  
To once again become a man high steppin' proud  
High steppin' proud man down on my knees  
Beckon to your every wish and your every need  
Oh I know it won't be long before I break those vows  
And once again become a man high steppin' proud  
[ 12str guitar ]  
There's a lot of things in life I'm glad I didn't miss  
And your good good love rates mighty high on the list  
But my restless spirit and a weddin' band don't get along somehow  
Especially since I long to be high steppin' proud  
High steppin' proud man...

Highways take me everywhere I want to go with one exception standing  
That road leads into the quiet places in the shadows of your mind  
The beaten path of common words can only lead us to misunderstanding  
I believe that I can see the love for you that is a greater kind  
  
Highways take me over the mountains into the valleys and out through the
plains  
Wanting to be in your heart's understanding I travel each highway in vain  
Highways only take me into places where the average of the crowd goes  
Where they affix the standard on the language and emotions of the love  
  
Highways never reach above the ground and cannot know the things a cloud knows  
In a million volumes they have never written to express my love  
Highways take me over the mountains...  
Highways take me over the mountains...

I guess I should've written, dad  
To let you know that I was coming home  
I've been gone so many years  
I didn't realize you had a phone  
  
I saw your cattle coming in,  
Boy they're looking mighty fat and slick  
I saw fred at the service station  
Told me that his wife is awful sick  
  
You heard my record on the radio  
Oh, well it's just another song  
But I've got a hit recorded  
And it'll be out on the market 'fore too long  
  
I got this ring in mexico  
No, it didn't cost me quite a bunch  
When you're in the business that I'm in  
The people call it puttin' up a front  
  
I know I've lost a little weight  
I guess I am looking kind of pale  
If you didn't know me better, dad  
You'd think that I'd just gotten out of jail  
  
No, we don't ever call them beer joints  
Night clubs are the places that I work  
You meet a lot of people there, but no,  
There ain't much chance of gettin' hurt  
  
I'm sorry that I couldn't be there with you all when momma passed away  
I was on the road and when they came and told me it was just too late  
  
I drove by the grave to see her, boy,  
That really is a pretty stone  
I'm glad that fred and jan are here,  
It's better than you being here alone  
  
Well I knew you's gonna ask me  
Who the lady is that's sleeping in the car  
That's just a girl who works for me  
And, man, she plays a pretty mean guitar  
  
We worked in San Antone last night,  
She didn't even have the time to dress  
She drove me down from nashville and  
To tell the truth I guess she needs the rest  
  
Well, dad, I gotta go,  
We got a dance to work in cartersville tonight  
Let me take your number down,  
I'll call you, and I promise you I'll write  
  
Now you be good and don't be chasin'  
All those pretty women that you know  
And by the way if you see barbara walker  
Tell her that I said "hello."

I can't dance and I never could, I guess my feet don't match  
I've been thinking 'bout dancing with you, but I'm afraid of hurtin' my back  
I don't know what you're doing but I like everything you do  
Just for a little bit baby I'd come out and dance with you  
  
[Chorus]  
But I can't dance and I'm feeling so good  
Some of us can and some of us can't and some of us wish that we could dance  
Some can't dance and I guess I'm just one of the unfortunate few  
Just for a little bit, baby, I'd come out and dance with you  
  
My mind is out there with you now but I can't get my body to move  
Sitting here falling in love, love, love thinking something I can't prove  
My soul is willing and my mind is ready but it's something that I never could
do  
Just for a little bit, baby, I'd come out and dance with you  
  
[Chorus]

I woke up this morning feeling so good feeling much better than I though I
could  
Bluebird would you lend me your wings today I feel like flying away  
I feel like flying away  
Fly up to Mexico maybe to Spain I've got some good friends who live up in
Maine  
Fly up to Paris and sample the wine ain't that a magnificient line  
Oh forgive me for saying I'd always be blue  
I should have known better that sun has come through  
My silver lining is turned inside out there's the sun everyone shouts  
Oh I feel like flying away  
  
Fly up to Mexico maybe to Spain...  
I feel like flying away

That old Kentucky moon was shinin' bright as day  
The stars were twinklin' in the milky way  
The pilot said if you look close there's frankfort on the right  
I flew over our house last night  
  
Thirty thousand feet below me you were fast asleep  
Thirty thousand feet above i almost stopped to weep  
So close and yet so far away, so wrong and yet so right  
I flew over our house last night  
  
For just one second i thought i was back in town  
The man your friends all say has only brought you down  
The airline hostess asked me, "sir, are you sure that you're alright?"  
I flew over our house last night  
  
Thirty thousand feet below me you were fast asleep  
And thirty thousand feet above i almost stopped to weep  
I wonder did you toss and turn as i roared out of sight  
I flew over our house last night

A man with forty acres plowed and planted  
Can't send no fourteen year old boy to no school  
The only thing I learned in the years I worked on my daddy's farm, was  
"Son, you better get them crops in when it turns cool"  
  
In the magazines, I saw the naked women  
I heard about the drinkin' and the bars  
If my daddy could've caught me, he'd a-killed me  
He said, "You might run, boy, but you ain't gonna get far"  
  
I hit town or you might say that it hit me  
Next mornin' there were things, I knew more about  
The woman who had taken me in said, "Country boy, you're all right"  
The same way, I turned her on, she turned me out  
  
The first law I broke, right away they got me  
I helped them build the country roads for awhile  
They fed me, two times a day and knocked me down about four  
For thirty days I didn't even crack a smile  
  
I met a nice girl and she said I was her baby  
She let me go and would never tell me why  
I learned what it means, to be somebody's baby  
They let you lie in your bed by yourself and cry  
  
The miles were good but the mileage is turnin' my hair gray  
I've met some people that knew me and call me friend  
Ain't no sense in wantin' my life to live over  
I'd find different ways to make those mistakes again  
  
So let me say this, I never tried to hurt anybody  
Though I guess there's a few, that I still couldn't look in the eye  
If I've got one wish, I hope it rains at my funeral  
For once, I'd like to be the only one dry

(I left you some kisses on the door)  
Your mama says I can't see you the judge says that it's right  
We can't be together cause me and mommie fights  
But you're my little girl and daddy loves you more and more  
  
And I left you some kisses on the door  
I came by to see you but mommie just said no  
I knocked but mommie saw me as she peeked through the hole  
I only want to hold you honey mommie thinks it's war  
But I left you some kisses on the door  
  
You know your daddy worries honey but it's not mama's fault  
You do what your mommie says you know that she's the boss  
No matter what I gave you mommie thought you needed more  
But I left you some kisses on the door  
  
Hey you're my little angel babe and it don't make much sense  
To only get to watch you play through that old schoolyard fence  
Someday you'll come to me sweetheart that's all I'm waitin' for  
'Cause I left you some kisses on the door

In some of my songs I have casually mentioned  
The fact that I like to drink beer  
This little song is more to the point  
Roll out the barrel and lend me your ears  
  
[Chorus:]  
I like beer, it makes me a jolly good fellow  
I like beer, it helps me unwind and sometimes it makes me feel mellow (Makes
him feel mellow)  
Whiskey's too rough, Champagne costs too much, vodka puts my mouth in gear  
This little refrain should help me explain as a matter of fact I like beer  
(He likes beer)  
  
My wife often frowns when we're out on the town  
And I'm wearing a suit and a tie  
She's sipping vermouth and she thinks I'm uncouth  
When I yell as the waiter goes by  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Last night I dreamed that I passed from the scene  
And I went to a place so sublime  
Aw, the water was clear and tasted like beer  
Then they turned it all into wine (Awww)  
  
[Chorus]

A mink wears a mink coat the whole year around  
Even when he is not going to town  
A skunk has a stripped coat, it's pretty he thinks  
Although we all know he stinks  
  
An elephant has hide as hard as a rock  
A zebra has stripes and the leopard has spots  
Sometimes I'm sad when I look at my hide  
But I'd rather feel pretty inside  
  
I like to feel pretty inside, don't you?  
I like being kind and I like being true  
I like to like me when I close my eyes  
I like to feel pretty inside, oh, I like to feel pretty inside  
  
If a mink wore a fur coat the whole year around  
If he had to wear it when he went to town  
If a skunk had a red coat and smell like a rose  
Do you think he'd turn up his nose?  
  
If elephants have fur as likely as not  
A leopard would have stripes and the zebra have spots  
I guess it would be great to have a new hide  
But I'd rather feel pretty inside  
  
I like to feel pretty inside, don't you?  
I like being kind and I like being true  
I like to like me when I close my eyes  
I like to feel pretty inside, oh, I like to feel pretty inside  
  
I like to feel pretty inside, don't you?  
I like being kind and I like being true  
I like to like me

I love little baby ducks, old pickup trucks  
Slow-movin' trains and rain  
I love little country streams, sleep without dreams  
Sunday school in May and hay  
And I love you, too  
  
I love leaves in the wind, pictures of my friends  
Birds of the world and squirrels  
I love coffee in a cup, little fuzzy pups  
Bourbon in a glass, and grass.  
And I love you, too  
  
I love honest, open smiles, kisses from a child  
Tomatoes on the vine and onions  
I love winners when they cry, losers when they try  
Music when it's good and life  
And I love you, too.

Wear something warm when it's wet  
Oh, I know you hate to be told  
I'm so afraid you'll forget  
You know how easy you catch cold  
Don't stay out late at a party  
You feel bad next day when you do  
And leave on a light when you're home alone at night  
I still care what happens to you  
I guess I shouldn't be concerned  
I guess I still haven't learned  
I can't worry about you after all we're through  
But I still care what happens to you  
I still care what happens to you  

Today the weather was so pretty  
At noon I went out for a stroll  
I walked and did some window shopping  
And met someone I used to know  
  
The years had been kind to her beauty  
When I first saw her my heart jumped  
Tonight if I seem disenchanted  
I took a memory to lunch  
  
We sat and talked about the old days  
With misty teardrops in our eyes  
And reconfirmed an old suspicion  
The past grows old but never dies  
  
The charm that draws two hearts together  
By four o' clock was just too much  
The days and years we had between us  
Were down to just two coffee cups  
  
You can't relive life in an hour  
The afternoon kept wearing on  
I'm sorry that I'm late for dinner  
I took a memory to lunch

The first strange town I was ever in  
The county was hangin' a man  
Nobody cared if he lived or died  
And I just didn't understand  
  
So I washed my face in the morning dew  
Bathed my soul in the sun  
Washed my face in the morning dew  
And kept on movin' along  
  
The second strange town I was in  
They were laughing at a poor crippled man  
Begging for nickels and dimes on the street  
And I just didn't understand  
  
The third strange town that I was in  
Was settled, peaceful and nice  
The rich got richer and the poor got poorer  
And to me it just didn't seem right  
  
So I washed my face in the morning dew  
Bathed my soul in the sun  
Washed my face in the morning dew  
And kept on movin' along  
  
Some day things are bound to change  
It can't be very far  
And each injustice I have seen  
Will come before the bar  
  
Then I'll wash my face in the morning dew  
Bathe my soul in the sun  
Wash my face in the morning dew  
And keep on movin' along

I wish I had a million friends and the playground as big as the world  
I wish I had a million friends some kittens some boys and some girls  
I wish I had a million friends some people some puppies and cats  
Some chickens some mouse and the bird  
  
And maybe I'd like to have a big friendly rat yeah  
I wish I had a million friends and the sandbox as big as the school  
I wish I had a million friends and the frog that goes ribbit in the pool  
I wish I had a million friends I'd like to have all different sorts  
  
One for the morning and the noon and the night  
A monkey and a zebra and a big white horse oh boy  
  
I wish I had a million friends who would listen and talk to me too  
I wish I had a million friends the whole wide world and the whole big Zoo  
I wish I had a million friends who were thoughtful kind and true  
I wish I had a million friends and I wish they were all like you

Way out on the mountain near the sky hiding from the cold realities of life  
Shaking that old road dust off my heels I give my heart and mind the chance to
heal  
Then I'll go somewhere and sing my songs again  
More than likely ride back to the places I have been  
In fairness to my music and my friends so I'll go somewhere and sing my songs
again  
A raccoon stole my minnows in the night I appreciate his need and his appetite  
But like me he doesn't have to roam Lord it's true that man can't live on
bread alone  
So I'll go somewhere  
  
Oh it feels so good to have a simple wish where life and death is me and some
old fish  
Poor king sits with a cold beer in his hand  
And he surveys a clear blue kingdom on the sand  
So I'll go somewhere

I'm a cowboy too I got to wear loafer shoes  
I have to wear a tie and when I wear my hat it makes the baby cry  
I'm a station wagon champ I'm the king of summer camps  
I love what I do but I'm a cowboy too  
I can't go out at night get into barroom fights  
If I ever lost my cool they'd make me tell it all in Sunday school  
Well my horse wouldn't feel at home my neighborhood is zoned  
Some say it ain't true but I'm a cowboy too  
I'm a cowboy too hey you oughta taste my barbecue  
If you ever heard me pickin' guitar well you would exclaim he oughta be a star  
I'm in love with my wife I'm in love with my life  
I sometimes get the blues cause I'm a cowboy too  
I could drive a pickup truck if I had six thousand bucks  
I had cowboy boots before but they left marks on the kitchen floor  
I get in trouble wearin' a hat and the beer just makes me fat  
Well my kids are buckaroos and I'm a cowboy too  
I'm a country music fan I buy every tape I can  
The man down where I work said a beard and the hair make me look like a jerk  
Well my wife don't understand she's a Willie and Waylon fan  
I got some people fooled oh but I'm a cowboy too

I said I'd leave you anytime I'm ready  
Some April when all the land is wet  
Some summer, some fall, or maybe winter  
I'll go someday, but I'm not ready yet  
I should've left the day your love was dyin'  
I passed up every date I ever set  
I know I'll leave you when my heart is ready  
I'm still around, 'cause I'm not ready yet  
Well, I've left a hundred times, but you don't know that  
Because I'm ashamed to tell how far I get  
You didn't, you don't, you'll never love me  
And someday I'll go, but I'm not ready yet  
I should've left the day your love was dyin'  
I passed up every date I ever set  
I know I'll leave you when my heart is ready  
I'm still around, 'cause I'm not ready yet  

The Iowa weather was 13 below  
I had come to Des Moines for a radio show  
I awoke in the evening from a traveler's sleep  
With notions of something to eat  
  
The old elevator slid down past the floors  
My head and my eyes said "You should have slept more."  
The man at the desk said the restaurant was closed  
Outside it was 14 below  
  
The lounge was still open and so I walked in  
In place of my food I had two double gins  
I looked 'round the room, as a tourist would do  
That's when I saw the girl in the booth  
  
She sat there and cried in the smoky half-dark  
The silent type crying that tears out your heart  
Her clothes were not cut in the new modern way  
And her suitcase had seen better days  
  
Nobody asked her what caused her such pain  
Nobody spoke up, yet no one complained  
Without even asking, I knew why she cried  
Life is just like that sometimes  
  
The man at the desk said, "It's 15 below."  
The bellhop said "Yeah man, that's cold...that's cold."  
I went back to my room and I wrote down this song  
Oh it sure can get cold in Des Moines

Georgia I love your big magnolia trees Texas I love to feel the prairie breeze  
Tennessee you made me what I am today but it's got to be Kentucky for me  
She loves me and she knows where I am Kentucky you are my motherland  
Say hello to the rivers and the trees oh it's got to be Kentucky for me  
[ guitar ]  
New York that's a fine place to go Colorado my it's pretty covered with the
snow  
California sunshine just brings me to my knees oh but it's got to be Kentucky
for me  
My flesh and my blood is buried there I believe that Jesus blessed the briar  
Big world I have seen your majesty but it's got to be Kentucky for me  
Oh it's got to be Kentucky for me

Mama likes to listen to the grand old gospel time  
Daddy is a cowboy drinkin' beer and wine  
Mama's in the kitchen standin' there all alone  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Daddy says come on down to Tootsie's and have yourself a beer  
Mama's in the kitchen standin' there in tears  
My mama love my daddy but it's breaking up our home  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Mama don't like drinkin' and she don't understand  
Daddy's had a hard life a deeply troubled man  
It's honky tonk and gospel that's breaking up our home  
She got Jesus on the radio and daddy on the phone  
  
Daddy says come on down...  
I came home one evening there was mama on her knees  
Big old tears of gospel joy running down her cheeks  
She says you don't have to worry son we are not alone  
  
I got Jesus on the radio and Jesus on the phone  
Daddy says come on down...

I will sing of a place that you may have seen in the eastern half of our land
so green  
Where the sun is warm and the sky is blue and the love of a girl is true  
Kentucky in the morning trimmed in green and blue  
Kentucky in the morning I was only passing through  
  
There's a bird that sings something sweet and pure  
That tune goes on while the beat sounds sure  
Oh if I could hum that old song today I could chase my blues away  
Kentucky in the morning...  
  
Oh I can't recall how I came to go by Kentucky shores on the Ohio  
As I crossed that bridge I looked back to say I will sing you a song someday  
Kentucky in the morning...

I got off the airplane 'long about 7:30 in L.A.  
What a drag to realize that everything's so different and so same  
All my California friends are searchin' for their minds and it's been right
there in their heads all the time  
  
[Chorus]  
L.A. Blues, L.A. Blues  
You want me to be like you  
Well, there ain't no way  
  
California Charlie met me at my room when I got in  
We toasted country pickin' and the health of all our good and mutual friends  
Before the mornin' came we put a handle on the world and decided that we'd
give it to the squirrels  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Soakin' up that sunshine an' eatin' eggs and bacon over light  
Sleepin' through the daytime an' contemplatin' sin throughout the night  
Please hand me my hat and darlin' give me back my things Ol' T's got a bunch
o' songs to sing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I like California, I wouldn't put it down-- no way  
But I heard what you're thinkin' and it ain't exactly what I want to say  
Some day California I'll come roarin' back to you if you don't fall in the
ocean 'fore I do  
  
[Chorus]

Woke up on a bus and heard the driver say  
Friends fill it up with No 2  
Wondered where I was and wondered what today  
Would be demanding me to do  
It's not for me the last cause I'm just goin'  
Where life's sendin' me I guess  
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
I sat pickin' on my guitar till I saw  
The new sun comin' through the skies  
Ain't it funny how the truth is sometimes  
Written on an artificial high  
Carry water from the well until you know  
That all the children are refreshed  
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
We were drinking too much yesterday  
Nobody's ever told us what's enough  
The ones that we should've prayed for more than likely  
Were the ones we had to cuss  
They applauded as we killed ourselves  
But angels don't have bourbon on their breath  
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
They came to see the people that they thought we were  
And never changed their minds  
They explained the way that difference caused  
The folks who love a picker can be blind  
They misunderstood the words but understood  
That our intentions were the best  
The thing that keeps us goin' is the good folks  
In the last hard town we met  
  
What a picker does for others is the thing  
He's mainly doing for himself  
There were friends and there were neighbors  
But the good homes that we came from didn't help  
If there's anything you'd like to say  
About us after we have gone to rest  
We would like someone to mention all the good folks  
In the last hard town we met

Gather round me boys and fill your coffee cups  
I'll tell you all a story while you drive them trucks  
A story bout a girl who joined the state patrol  
The legend of the Lady Bear is how it goes  
She married some young trucker she was in her teens  
And like all newly weds they had their hopes and dreams  
And one night in a snowstorm so the story went  
She lost her loving husband in an accident  
They say she sat and cried for him a year or more  
And all she did was think of him and walk the floor  
She'd lie there in her bed at night alone and cold  
Until one day she joined the highway state patrol  
  
[Guitar ]  
  
Well they say she has a CB and she's on the air  
And she goes by the handle of the Lady Bear  
She never gives a ticket and she works at night  
All she does is tell the story of her life  
I've heard some truckers say there ain't no Lady Bear  
And others say she don't work when the weather's fair  
But when the weather's bad she's on the air all night  
Begging us to slow down till the weather's right  
Well you know I love this story well it could be true  
If you're ever in a snowstorm tell you what to do  
If you should hear the Lady Bear on your radio  
Well tell her I wrote this song and said hello

One night in the West Virginia mountains I got stranded in the deepening snow  
I found important house and took a small room no TV magazines or radio  
I've stood and watched the snow fall past the window  
And as a traveling man would sometimes do  
I've picked up the Bible and looked through it I found the stock of letters
tied in blue  
The letters had been left there by a young girl there were ten and as I read
the first  
I found that they were from a boy in Detroit  
Who'd sent for her as soon as he got work  
The first one mentioned her expected baby  
The one and two and three were much the same  
The fourth and fifth said that he might send to get her  
The sixth and seventh offered her his name  
The eighth and ninth were weeks apart in postmark  
They were short and asked about her help  
The tenth one was a tear stained on the pages  
Said that he had married someone else  
Next morning I felt guilty when I checked out  
As the highway people cleared away the snow  
I asked about the girl who used to live there  
They said she passed away three weeks ago  
Well I kept the letters but I never read them  
Oh but somewhere up in Detroit there's a man  
Who heard what happened down in West Virginia  
And we're the only two who understand  
  
  

A little brown suitcase at the top of the stairs  
Not much to start with and worse for the wear  
Mama said Virgil let's throw that away he said no it might come in handy some
day  
Well first there was Billy Joe then there was Jack  
They took that old suitcase but all brought it back  
Now some went a ridin' and some had to walk  
But Lord if that little brown suitcase could talk  
Well my brother Quentin the one with a smile  
He took that old suitcase and he went to Ohio  
And he brought it back on Christmas full of toys and things  
And some Bill Monroe records that I soon learned to sing  
Well that was the year of fifth seven and the month of July  
When I took that old suitcase and I joined the GI's  
I followed the pattern set down by the rest  
On the inside of the cover I wrote my address  
Well my folks are passed on now I don't know where it's at  
You know Betty might know cause she keeps things like that  
And when dad gets to heaven mom won't be alarmed  
If he got that old suitcase tucked under his arms

The little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
We got married in a little white church  
I had a big red rose on my shirt  
You had some flowers but you gave them away  
And the little green flower was bloomin' that day  
It's that little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
Remember the night that I came home drunk  
Stopped in the driveway got you a bunch  
You got mad said they shouldn't be picked  
They were there next morning when I woke up sick  
It's that little green flower with the yellow on top  
You told me the name but I soon forgot  
I know roses and forget-me-nots what's  
That little green flower with the yellow on top  
It's been a long time since I gave you that ring  
You often said I didn't know a bloomin' thing  
But happy anniversary and look what I got  
Some little green flowers with the yellow on top  

Oh, the little lady preacher from the limestone church  
I'll never forget her, I guess  
She preached each Sunday morning on the local radio  
With a big black Bible and a snow-white dress  
  
She was 19 years of age and was developed to a fault  
But I will admit she knew the Bible well  
A little white lace hanky marked the text that she would use  
She'd breathe into that microphone and send us all to hell  
  
She had a guitar picker by the name of Luther Short  
A hairy-legged soul lost out in sin  
She would turn and smile at Luther when the program would commence  
With a voice as sweet as angels she would break out in a hymn  
  
I was picking for her too with what we call the doghouse bass  
I clung to every word that passed her lips  
She was down on booze and cigarettes and high on days to come  
And she'd punctuate the prophecy with movements of her hips  
  
The Lord knows how I loved her, he was there each time she preached  
But ol' Luther took her home each Sunday morn'  
Looking back I still recall the way it hurt my tender pride  
I longed to be a hero but they're made not born  
  
Sometimes ol' Luther showed up at the studio half-tight  
And smoking was a thing he liked to do  
She never said a word to him but said a prayer for me  
I told her in a way that I'd been praying for her too  
  
One Sunday her old man showed up and said that she was gone  
Said she and brother Luther had a call  
I can see me standing in that studio that day  
I had to face the heartbreak, unemployment and all  
  
I don't know where they are 'cause I ain't seen them people since  
Lord if I judge 'em let me give 'em lots o' room  
I know ol' Luther Short and he's a hard ol' boy to change  
And I've often sat and wondered who it was converted whom

I have been a rover I have walked alone  
Hiked a hundred highways never found a home  
Still in all I'm happy the reason is you see  
Once in a while along the way love's been good to me  
There was a girl in Portland before the winter chill  
We used to go out courtin' along October Hill  
She could laugh away the dark clouds cry away the snow  
Seems like only yesterday down the road I go  
I have been a rover...  
There was a girl in Houston out where the hot winds blow  
Why I had to leave her God Almighty knows  
She could take the long hot summer cool it with a sigh  
Words have no more wisdom when it's time to say goodbye  
I have been a rover...  
  
  

He's got nothing but talent and time on his hands  
He loves his music, hangs out with his band  
He's got big-hit ambitions and number one dreams  
He's a high-rollin', a magnificent music machine  
He hit town with nothing but his old guitar  
With visions of grandeur and being a star  
He writes them and sings them like you've never seen  
He's a high-rollin', a magnificent music machine  
Well sometimes he's dejected and sometimes he's afraid  
But he knows what he's in for 'til his dues are paid  
Sometimes they're fat girls and sometimes they're lean  
He's a high-rollin', a magnificent music machine

If I live forever I will not forget  
The man who hated freckles that I met  
He was absolute about it and his hate intensified  
He said I hate them folks with freckles on their hides.  
  
I can't stand them folks with freckles he would say  
They're tearing down the good old usa  
I've never met a one who couldn't dance  
And they'll steal your watermelons if they ever get a chance.  
  
Oh, he hated every freckle that he saw  
He said they should be shot down by the law  
They oughta send them all back where they're from  
And he said would you let your daughter marry one.  
  
He said I hate them folks with freckles in my sleep  
They're on welfare and their houses ain't too neat  
They moved in near some fair complected friends  
And them freckled folks are running down the neighborhood we're in.  
  
Well, he'd see a kid with freckles and he cuss  
Said because of them my children have the bus  
We wouldn't have the trouble we have seen  
If it wasn't for that Martin Luther Queen.  
  
But the man who hated freckles had some friends  
And they organized a Ban the Freckles Klan  
The man who hated freckles made me sick  
But as far as I'm concerned he was a stupid son of a...

My name's in the paper where I took the Boy Scouts to hike  
My hands are all dirty from working on my little boy's bike  
The preacher came by and I talked for a minute with him  
My wife's in the kitchen and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
And I know why she's there 'cause I've been there before  
But I made a promise that I wouldn't cheat anymore  
  
I tried to ignore it but I know she's in there my friend  
My mind's on a number and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
Next Sunday it's my turn to speak to the young people's class  
They expect answers to all of the questions they ask  
What would they say if I spoke on a modern day sin  
And all of the Margie's at all of the Lincoln Park Inns  
  
The bike is all fixed and my little boy is in bed asleep  
His little ol' puppy is curled in a ball at my feet  
My wife's baking cookies to feed to the bridge club again  
I'm almost out of cigarettes and Margie's at the Lincoln Park Inn  
  
And I know why she's there

(The Storytellers and I were doing a show down in Meridian, Mississippi.  
And these friends of mine came up and brought me this real old book  
About John Henry and they told me if they let me read this old book I'd  
Probably write a song about it.  
And they did and I did and I called it more About John Henry.)  
  
First of all John Henry was a black man  
He was born where the sun don't ever shine  
He was six feet tall he didn't know his own strength  
But he did not swing the hammer all the time  
Of course he didn't John Henry had some women on his mind.  
  
There was a woman cross the street named Poor Selma  
Loved John Henry like a natural man  
John Henry quit Poor Selma just like he was quitting work  
He loved that stinger of Julie Anne  
And what is it a stinger is something else you understand.  
  
There was a man named Stacker Lee in Argenta a little man with a big 44  
You know he shot his woman down and took a shot at Poor Selma  
But ol' Stacker won't be shooting anymore  
He had to quit it John Henry laid him dead on the floor.  
  
John Henry threw Stacker Lee in the river  
Then he said I've got a say so to say  
He broke out in a song that was wrote by Blind Leonard  
He said Julie Anne I'm singing my say  
He said I love you but I do not like your lowdown ways.  
  
Well, John Henry went to a conjuring woman  
Said this misery ain't no way to live  
Somebody's back door creeping on my pretty Julie Anne  
Conjure woman had a say so to give  
She said, "John Henry." she said, "That's just the way things is."  
  
Well, John Henry went to a hell busting man  
Said I'm tormented deep in my soul  
Well, that hell buster prayed John Henry's sins away  
And they tell me that the thunder did roll  
Sweet Jesus what a frightening sight to behold.  
  
From that day on John Henry was a changed man  
All he did was just work all the time  
Well, he worked till the muscles in his body gave out  
Then he kept right on a working in his mind  
Don't do it cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time.  
  
Julie Anne said John Henry I love you  
Poor Selma said John Henry you're my man  
Ruby said I'm gonna cook ye up some greens and some lean meat  
With corn bread in a four foot pan  
With lots of cracklings but John Henry was a different kinda man.  
  
Well, they allow that hard work killed John Henry,  
I'm gonna leave that allowing up to you,  
Well, was he killed by hard work or was he killed by bad women  
Be sure that this ain't happening to you.  
  
Quit working when your day's work work is through  
Cause a man ain't supposed to work all the time  
And ain't that just the way the things is  
A stinger is something else you understand  
Quit working when your your day's work is through God bless you

He's wantin' her more than he's wantin' his wife  
Buddy that's a good way to screw up your life  
He sneaks off to see her when he gets a chance  
That's a perfect example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin' in the back door that ain't no 10-4 it's a negatory romance  
It's a real breaker maker when your heart is a taker it's a negatory romance  
Now girl don't go chasin' a man who ain't free  
You know there are plenty of fish in the sea  
So girl don't go chasin' whatever wears pants  
That's another example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin' in the back door...  
Slippin' around on the back streets of life  
Changin' your handle for one cheatin' night  
Slidin' off your gold band just so you can dance  
That's another example of a negatory romance  
Sneakin' in the back door...

I hope that gleam that you have in your eye  
Is reflection from the buttons on your blouse  
If it's not then we're in trouble, I can tell you why  
I'm old enough to want to and fool enough to try  
  
They don't make women like you anymore  
And since there's not enough to go around  
If you think what I think you're thinking, this is what I think  
I'd be a crazy fool to turn you down  
  
I hope that smile that you have on your lips  
Is just a smile that you wear all the time  
If it's something special then start making up your line  
I'm old enough to want to and fool enough to try  
  
I'm old enough to want to and fool enough to try

I've spent the lifetime making up my mind to be  
More than the measure of what I thought others could see  
Good luck and fast bucks they're too few and too far between  
There's catalog buyers and old five and dimers like me  
She stood beside me letting me know she would be  
Something to lean on when everything ran out on me  
Well fenced yards ain't hole cards and like is not ever will be  
The reason for rhymers and old five and dimers like me  
  
Well it's taking me so long now that I know I believe  
All that I do or say is all I ever will be  
Too far and too high and too deep ain't too much to see  
Too much ain't enough for old five and dimers like me  
An old five and dimer is all I intended to be  
(You know country people don't shine their boots very often  
And they don't shine other folks' boots either thank you)

Old habits die hard  
Old habits like loving you  
Like spending my days and nights  
In missing you  
Hours that were yours echo like empty rooms  
Strange faces and your place can't keep away the gloom  
Old habits die hard now that you're gone  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits like being true  
Like counting the hours  
Till I could be with you  
Things we used to share I now keep alone  
I waste my nights here by the telephone  
Old habits die hard, now that you're gone  
Hours that were yours echo like empty rooms  
Strange faces and your place can't keep away the gloom  
Old habits die hard now that you're gone  

Ole lonesome George the basset lived in Brentwood Tennessee  
And even though he had his faults he was a sight to see  
He taught the show dog puppies to always try and please  
To hold their heads and tails up and not wet the judge's knees  
Ole George was not a champion but his owners loved him so  
They drived the car to the dogshows ole George would get the dough  
But when he'd get out in the rain he never could win first  
Several judges shook their heads and said he was the worst  
Then one day the kannel keeper got an urgent call  
From the local TV to Mr Tom T Hall  
They said Johnny Cash is puttin' on the show tonight  
He says he needs a basset you've got one ain't that right  
Lonesome George went to the show and he did everything  
He barked and growled and jumped around and made the rappers ring  
He'd left the people cheering for another curtain call  
And so ole lonesome George became the show dog after all mhm

If I were you, I wouldn't waste my time  
You can't answer all the questions in your mind  
Love is love and you can't make it right  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
(Chorus)  
How can you know love when no one ever knew  
It's the mother of all happiness and father of the blues  
Love puts sunshine in your days, then steals your sleep at night  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
Maybe you should take it day by day  
If you hold love too loosely, it will fly away  
If you hold love too tightly, it will die  
It's one of the mysteries of life  
  
(Chorus)

Over and over say you forgive me for the crazy fool I've been  
Over and over I'll be sorry over and over again  
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again  
That's one lesson I'll remember over and over again  
Back together now and forever ever more will I be true  
Over and over I'm gonna prove it over and over to you  
[ guitar ]  
Over and over say you forgive me I'll be faithful to the end  
I will prove I can be trusted over and over again  
Would I be untrue to you dear no no never again...  
Over and over over and over over and over over and over  
Over and over over and over over and over over and over  
  
  

I'm the guy who didn't marry pretty pamela brown  
Educated, well-intentioned, good girl in our town  
I wonder where i'd be today if she had loved me too  
Probably be driving kids to school  
  
(chorus)  
I guess i owe it all to Pamela brown  
All of my good times and all my roamin' around  
One of these days i might come ramblin' through your town  
And i guess i owe it all to Pamela brown  
  
I've seen the lights of cites and i've been inside their doors  
I've sailed to foreign countries and i've walked upon their shores  
I guess the guy she married was the best part of my luck  
She dug him 'cause he drove a pick-up truck  
  
(chorus)  
I don't have to tell you just how beautiful she was  
Everything it takes to get a country boy in love  
Lord, i hope she's happy 'cause she sure deserves to be  
Especially for what she did for me  
  
(chorus)

"I loved that song.  
I saw a little story in the newspaper about the size of a pack of cigarettes -
it said:  
'Pinto the Wonder Horse is Dead.'  
But I was reading the newspaper and I was looking for part two of the story  
I had already started -  
so I never read the story, I just saw the headline and kept going.  
A week later I said, 'My God, where's that newspaper?' I started askin people
- I figured he was the horse that belonged to some cowboy movie star, but
nobody had a horse named Pinto. So I just made him up, made him into a
childhood hero."  
I read it in the paper just about a week ago  
It was on the back page and not many people know  
Boy it made me feel bad when I picked it up and read Pinto the wonder horse is
dead  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together at the Saturday morning picture show  
The dusty trails're gone now but it hurts to hear it said  
Pinto the wonder horse is dead  
My memory goes back to when I was a little kid  
We believed in everything that Pinto ever did  
Will our kids have a hero half as brave or half as strong  
Pinto the wonder horse is gone  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together...  
We believed that Pinto was the fastest horse alive  
If he outrun the wind itself we never were surprised  
In my childhood memory full of boys grow into men Pinto the wonder rides again  
Oh we rode the dusty trails together...  
Pinto the wonder horse is gone

There's a sadness in your singing, I have never heard before  
There's a dying in your living that exists from shore to shore  
There's a coward in your character that I have never seen  
America, what happened to the promise and the dream  
The promise was that men could live and worship as they please  
The dream was for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free  
We closed so many doors and banned the prayers on many scenes  
America, what happened to the promise and the dream  
There's a numbness in your feeling for the disadvantaged poor  
There's a weakness in your strength because your leaders are unsure  
There are shadows in the light that once was freedom's brightest beam  
America, what happened to the promise and the dream  
The promise was that men could live and worship as they please  
The dream was for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free  
You closed so many doors and banned the prayer on many scenes  
America, what happened to the promise and the dream  
There's a hating in your loving for the permanence of vows  
Tomorrow doesn't matter it's all for the here and now  
Your most important word called love is now a dirty thing  
America, what happened to the promise and the dream  
The promise was that men could live and worship as they please  
The dream was for the huddled masses yearning to breathe free  
We closed so many doors and banned the prayers on many scenes  
America, what happened to the promise and the dream  

Dear, I thought I drop a line  
The weather is cool, the folks are fine  
I'm in bed each night at nine  
P.S. I love you  
Yesterday we had some rain  
But all in all, I can't complain  
Was it dusty on the train  
P.S. I love you  
Write to the Brown's just as soon as you're able  
They came around to call  
I burned a hole in the dining room table  
And let me see, I guess that's all.  
Nothing else for me to say  
And so I'll close, but by the way  
Everybody's thinking of you  
P.S. I love you  
Nothing else for me to say  
And so I'll close, but by the way  
Everybody's thinking of you  
P.S. I love you  

In the shadow of the saddle, running wild and running free  
In a herd of running mustangs there's a part of you and me  
Broken spirit broken promises make them fear the sight of man  
In the shadow of the saddle lives the wild horse, bronco band  
Call 'em cayuse, call 'em broncos ,call 'em mustangs, call 'em free  
In the shadow of the saddle, let them run, boys, let them be  
We have changed the land and water just to fit our selfish needs  
Now the shadow of the saddle falls across these gallant steeds  
Oh, the Spanish and the Indians gave them freedom in the sun  
In the name of God and nature, let them run boys, let them run  
Call 'em cayuse, call 'em broncos [unverified]  

You know I love my music, it's really all I got  
I never really cared that much if I was cold or hot  
Now I got a job to do, I don't want to begin  
I've gotta write a sad song for my friend  
He was not like me no he tried a lot but just like me he cried a lot  
Oh, I never thought I'd have to cause that ain't what I'm in  
I've gotta write a sad song for my friend  
She was quite a lady and he was quite a guy  
They were quite a couple it was quite a cry  
They used to sit and laugh a lot 'cause I like to pick and grin  
They helped me write a sad song for my friend  
He was not like me [unverified]  
I don't wanna sing no sad songs for my friend  

Me and Yates an army buddy o'mine were doin' three years in Germany at the
time  
We came upon these Frauleins in the bar  
Yates said darf isch zee be-gleit-en they said ya  
(And darf isch zee be-gleit-en means can we sit with you all)  
  
Oh we must have drunk ten quarts of German beer  
My conscience and my sinuses were clear  
I asked that Fraulein if she was a spy she said nein but do bis ain bissel
high  
(A condition not uncommon to the American soldier)  
  
Well later on I went to be excused when I returned I was a bit confused  
Yates and his Fraulein had hit the air another guy was sittin' in my chair  
(A young soldier whom we shall get to know better)  
I said excuse me Mister that's my seat I'd like to have it back sir if you
please  
  
That girl's a nurse and I've been awful sick the man looked up at me and said
mox-nix  
(Which means that he was not overly concerned with my health)  
Next thing I knew he had a switchblade knife  
Lord I didn't know that Fraulein was his wife  
  
I took off through that Gasthaus like a fool behind me I heard the crashing
stools  
(As the police would say he was in hot pursuit)  
Well the waitress yelled there's MPs on the way  
That's one more reason I didn't want to stay  
  
As I went out the window somethin' went switch  
And I giggled all the way home knowin' he missed  
(At the time it seemed like a laughing matter)  
But next morning my coat was lyin' there on the bunk  
  
And when I saw that coat it made me jump  
That man had cut my coat right down the back  
A little bit more and they'd been playin' me taps  
(And knowin' the sad nature of that song I would decline it)  
  
Well later on I heard that guy got stabbed  
They sent him home and didn't that make me glad  
On love and marriage I want to say one thing oh lady if you're married wear
that ring  
  
(And the army has a new policy if you can't move it paint it  
If it has a switchblade knife salute it  
Not necessarily an incident one would want to write Mother about  
Germany being full of good soldiers good people)

On the floor of the limo there's a bottle of whiskey  
A white Stetson hat with a fine feather band  
His face covered up with the two day old paper  
He's a songwriter legend that grey haired old man  
They don't say much to him he don't say much to them  
They wonder what goes on inside his old head  
Sometimes when they shake him tryin' to wake him  
He comes round so slowly they think that he's dead  
And you're not allowed to talk about Denver Colorado  
You're not allowed to talk about his first wife Joanne  
You're not allowed to talk about his first fiddle player  
Or anybody who ever worked in Elvis's band  
He motions the driver to get him some coffee  
He sits there and sips it his eyes on the floor  
When he's readin' his paper he sometimes looks angry  
He's still tryin' to figure out the Second World War  
He mentions Chicago the Opry and Wheeling  
His awards are all stacked in the box in his barn  
He made millions of dollars with a hoop and a holler  
Now he lives in a trailer on a five acre farm  
And you're not allowed to talk about...  
As the limo rolls on down the America's highways  
Just frames to the sign on the side of his car  
It says pickin' and singin' for any occasion the songwrittin' senior citizen
star

Shame on the rain for making me twice as blue  
It's raining in my heart on my window too  
Days just like this have put out the flame  
I've got that smoke in my eyes shame on the rain  
You'd think it's enough just to know that she's gone  
With my kind of luck it will rain from now on  
After I'd lost such a heartbreaking game  
You'd think the sun would shine shame on the rain  
[ guitar ]  
Shame on the rain for adding to my unrest she took the sun it figures I guess  
I have my share of sorrow and pain look what a day it is shame on the rain  
Look what a day it is shame on the rain  
  
  

Ships go out I see them every day  
Ships go out I watch them sail away  
And on the decks I see my smiling friends  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
Ships go out I watch them disappear  
Ships go out and leave me standing here  
And I don't know if that's where life begins  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
When life is cheap it never seems to last  
When life is sweet it seems to go too fast  
So on the dock I tell the idle wind  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
Ships go out onto the seas so high  
Ships go out beneath an endless sky  
And on the shore is where their stories end  
Ships go out but they never do come in  
When life is cheap it never seems to last  
Ships go out  

I'm humming as I walk this house and do my daily chores  
When I put the broom away I see the dress that Alice wore  
It's hanging in the closet sadly sagging without form  
Empty dress there in the closet held a body soft and warm  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
It's the dress she wore the night she caught me lying there beside  
Some strange woman meaning nothing just some bones and hair and hide  
I could pot explain it to her and I cannot to this day  
Now I stand here staring at the dress she wore to go away  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
And the shoes are red and shiny and they're modest in the heel  
And the dress a bad investment and the color could be teal  
She went screaming from the room where I lay blinking in the nude  
With the woman there beside me saying ain't this woman rude  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
So, I asked the undertaker in a private kind of way  
Before you close the casket when our friends have gone away  
If it's not too strange to reason I would make one last request  
Since it all goes in the ground I'd like to have the shoes and dress  
Shoes and dress that Alice wore  
So, I'm humming as I walk this house  

Well I met a man in Montgomery Alabama  
I was waitin' on a bus and he was shinin' shoes and I heard him say  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land  
A shoeshine man make you shine where you stand  
  
Leave me a tip if you can I'm a shoeshine man  
Well I can sing I can dance I can play the harmonica too  
I got a brand new thing on the South Side Montgomery Blues  
You better stick around and watch me cause I'm an entertainin' fool  
  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land...  
Well I learned my trade from that rag-poppin' daddy o'mine  
He shined twelve alligators made a hundred dollar bill one time  
And when the meat gets scarce I shine two or three pairs for a dime  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land...  
  
I had a girl that helped me she had a lotta hoochy coochy ways  
She was bumping and grinding paid that girl a dollar a day  
But she was shy on age and the law come and took her away  
I'm a shoeshine man number one in the land...

Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo  
You're just a little baby boy six months old lying in your mama's lap  
I'm sittin' here thinkin' of a song I could sing to get you to take a nap  
You were born on the part of the river of life where the water is troubled and
deep  
This day and time there are not many songs to sing a little baby to sleep  
Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo  
I search my mind for a proper subject to set down the reason and rhyme  
And I got to thinking it might have been better to be born at some other time  
I know you're tired and I know you're weary and I don't like to see you weep  
But there just don't seem to be any songs going to sing a little baby to sleep  
Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo  
I'll rock your cradle and your mama will croon that's all the comfort we know  
You need a song you can keep on singing cause you've got a long way to go  
Faith writes the words and love writes the music and hope can establish the
beat  
Your generation might know a song to sing a little baby to sleep  
Too doo dup too doo doo doo doo doo

If you ever worry, will I be true  
Don't you worry, I'll be true  
And I'll be true, sky blue true  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
As blue as the skies, as blue as your eyes  
As bright as the sun, as sweet as you hon  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
If you ever wonder, do I love you  
Don't you wonder I love you?  
And I'll be true, sky blue true  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
As blue as the skies, as blue as your eyes  
As bright as the sun, as sweet as you hon  
I'll be true, sky blue true  
And when the sun sets over our lives  
We'll be together beyond the skies  
And I'll be true eternally true  
I'll be true, sky blue true  

Boys and girls take warning  
If you go near the lake  
Keep your eyes wide open  
And look for sneaky snake  
  
Now, maybe you won't see him  
And maybe you won't hear  
But he'll sneak up behind you  
And drink all your root beer  
  
And then sneak snake goes dancing  
Wiggling and a-hissing  
Sneaky snake goes dancing  
A-giggling and a-kissing  
I don't like old sneaky snake  
He laughs too much you see  
When he goes wiggling through the grass  
It tickles his underneath  
  
Well sneaky snake drinks root beer  
And he just makes me sick  
When he is not dancing  
He looks just like stick  
  
Now he doesn't have any arms or legs  
You cannot see his ears  
And while we are not looking  
He's stealing all of our beer  
  
And then sneak snake goes dancing  
Wiggling and a-hissing  
Sneaky snake goes dancing  
A-giggling and a-kissing  
I don't like old sneaky snake  
He laughs too much you see  
When he goes wiggling through the grass  
It tickles his underneath

I'll follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune  
I'd rather chase rainbows than stay here  
And grow old and never know  
How high I could fly if I reach for the sky  
It's my turn to try  
So I'll take my best hold  
I've done my time in the beer and wine mines  
Tryin' to climb with my own kind of rhymes  
It ain't easy  
I've had my doubts what they're mostly about  
Whether I should reach out to the crowd  
To just try to please me  
Chasin' the brass rein and bendin' guitar strings  
Are the things I enjoy most of all  
We can just call this a mission of mercy  
But the soldier of fortune should fall  
(I'll follow my dreams)  
I already know, it's a rough row to hoe  
But I can't let go  
I've been almost so close a few times  
My sights are all set, it's my chance to get  
Somethin' better than whatever  
It is that I'm leavin' behind  
Chasin' the brass rein and bendin' guitar strings  
Are the things I enjoy most of all  
We can just call this a mission of mercy  
But the soldier of fortune should fall  
I'll follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune  
I'd rather chase rainbows than stay here  
And grow old and never know  
How high I could fly if I reach for the sky  
It's my turn to try  
So I'll take my best hold  
I'll follow my dreams like a soldier of fortune  

I hate to write this song I never wanted to  
But after all, Curt writin' songs is what I do  
Right now the paper's staring at me, cold and blank  
Defying me to even try express my thanks  
But this song is for you uncle Curt  
You never were my uncle, ain't that strange?  
This song is for you uncle Curt  
A name is just a name, is just a name, is just a name  
They called and said that you had bought your final's rout  
You gave me hell right to the end and I was proud  
I know, some friends have wanted you to beg for life  
But I knew, you'd live long enough to learn to die  
This song is for you uncle Curt  
You never were my uncle, ain't that strange?  
This song is for you uncle Curt  
A name is just a name, is just a name, is just a name  
I'm living down in Nashville now and writin' tunes  
The neighborhood is full of trees and good saloons  
I just got back from California on a plane  
Everything is different but it's just the same  
And this song is for you uncle Curt  
You never were my uncle, ain't that strange?  
This song is for you uncle Curt  
A name is just a name, is just a name, is just a name  
A name is just a name, is just a name, is just a name  

Do you like true stories? I do  
That's why I'm singing this song  
A song about one legged chicken  
Who lives in the straw on the floor in my barn  
I remember the day she was hatched out  
The vet came to see her and said  
"She has only one leg, she'll never grow up"  
He said that chick would be better off dead  
I said, "No, let's just let her keep growing  
We'll just wait and see how she gets"  
Before very long she was hopping  
And pecking and chasing the bugs with the rest  
And now she is a beautiful chicken  
Though she has only one leg  
When I go to see her each morning  
She hops from the nest and she leaves me an egg  
And she cackles  
Do you like true stories? I do  
That's why I've sung you this song  
The song about the one legged chicken  
Who lives on the floor in my barn  

Take these arms of mine, throw them away  
They're just souvenirs of some other day  
Take these lips of mine, they're useless to me  
They're just souvenirs of things that used to be  
  
(Chorus)  
They're just souvenirs and who needs 'em now  
They're just bits and pieces of my yesterday, anyhow  
Take this old heart of mine, it's been beating too long  
It's just a souvenir of something that went wrong  
  
Take my yesterdays, the minutes, the hours  
They're just souvenirs, they'll fade like the flowers  
Take these eyes before I see her again  
They're just souvenirs of things that might have been  
  
(Chorus)  
Ol' T's just a souvenir of something that went wrong

I don't know what I'm doing here, I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin' wine, wine, wine  
I don't know what I'm doing here, I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin' 'shine, 'shine, 'shine  
The dogs are running down in Memphis  
And them nags are running in LA  
I'm stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
And there ain't no way to get away  
Willie Nelson's picking out in Austin  
And Waylon's hanging out in Mexico  
I'm stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
And Kris is making movin' picture shows  
Hey, I don't know what I'm doing here, I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin' wine, wine, wine  
I don't know what I'm doing here, I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin' 'shine, 'shine, 'shine  
Well I know they're dancing in New Orleans  
And old Chicago's bright as day  
I'm stuck in Spokane in a motel room  
Lord, I wish I had a Dolly Parton tape  
Well Hill and Bare and Billy Joe they're gambling  
And ol' TP's frying croppie all night long  
They're down at Tootsie's eating chili  
I'm stuck in Spokane a-writing songs  
Hey, I don't know what I'm doing here, I could be someplace else  
Like in Atlanta drinkin' wine, wine, wine  
I don't know what I'm doing here, I should be someplace else  
Like in Kentucky drinkin' clear moonshine

I saw an eagle catch a fish crossed my fingers made a wish  
He flew away to clear blue skies the way an eagle flies  
I saw the sun rise o'er the sea through the clouds he winked at me  
Brightened up and seemed to say here is another day  
Out of St George Isle people make you smile  
Won't you bide a while out on St George Isle  
[ sax ]  
I found a penny on the beach in the sand beneath my feet  
Fortune someone had one day and let it slip away  
Oyster boats in disarray scattered all around the bay  
Makes me think of one complaint I wish that I could paint  
Out of St George Isle...  
Out of St George Isle...

You know what I've been doin' honey since you said goodbye  
I've been gettin' close to walkin' my one millionth mile  
I walked the floor so much just thinkin' where could you be  
St Louis named a shoe after me  
  
St Louis is famous for its shoes don't you know  
Loafers and sneakers and they're makin' them all with soul  
Honey I walked so doggone much since you set me free  
St Louis named a shoe after me  
  
When I was walkin' all night long and steppin' on my tears  
It never dawned on me that someone out there really cared  
I walked the floor so well I'm gonna do it on TV St Louis named a shoe after
me  
St Louis is famous...  
  
[Trumpet]  
  
Well don't think that I'm braggin' I don't care about that shoe  
Come on home before they name a river for me too  
They're just feeling sorry for me that's plain to see St Louis named a shoe
after me  
St Louis is famous...  
  
St Louis named a shoe after me  
Well you know they didn't name it after Jerry Lee St Louis named a shoe after
me

Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there, where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines, but an orphan can't go  
  
My mother is dead, she doesn't care where I go  
My father left a long, long time ago  
I had me a frog, he never whined or cried  
I kept him in my pocket and he died  
Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there, where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines, but an orphan can't go  
  
Bobby had a brother, he got killed in the war  
I asked him but he didn't know what for  
My mother was pretty, she had long black hair  
Once, she promised me a teddy bear  
  
Summer comes laughing to Strawberry Farms  
Have you ever been there, where the wind never blows  
Summer comes early to Strawberry Farms  
Oh the sun always shines, and things don't die

Out on the edge of town I bought a two room brick  
Moved in as soon as I got the plumbin' all fixed  
Making them payments worked my fingers to the bone  
Anything I had to do to get myself a home  
There was water in the basement it looked like a swimming pool  
The man said son that water'll help to keep your cottage cool  
The Welcome Wagon brought me out some sleepin' pills and booze  
I got the mean old subdivision blues  
Somebody came and knocked my fence down just the other day  
Tore up my yard and hauled my lawnmower away  
Shot out my windows with the BB gun  
A buggsy down the street came by and beat up my son  
So I went out and bought myself a big old German dog  
The man behind me saw me and he started raisin' hogs  
A nineteen year old girl next door is sunnin' in the nude  
I got those mean old subdivision blues  
But I bought my house because it was located near a school  
Now a bus comes by and takes my kids to Istambul  
The guy next door just bought his son a brand new saxophone  
The man behind me sued him cause his hogs were leavin' home  
My buddy left his wife now he's livin' in a tent  
A hippie sued me cause I did not have a room to rent  
They built a trailer park before I had a chance to move  
I got them mean old subdivision blues  
  
[ harmonica ]  
  
Well I moved out in the country just as far as I could go  
I couldn't even get the Grand Ole Opry on the radio  
I guess you know what happened just as soon as I moved in  
The man across the valley started clearin' off this land  
The law came out and said that I would have to move my barn  
They said the man next door was gonna subdivide his farm  
They auctioned off my farm to build the state another school  
I got the mean old subdivision blues  
Well other night I dreamed I died and I went right straight to hell  
I don't know what I did but you know you can never tell  
They handed me a key and handed me a little map  
They said you got a place to live we'll show you where it's at  
They took me to a two room brick just on the edge of town  
With thirty thousand other little houses falling down  
A million years to pay it off with payments overdue  
It's hell to have the subdivision blues got those mean old subdivision blues

It wasn't much but I sold it all and I moved to San Antone  
Knowing in my heart that Texas had to be my home  
I fell in love with Texas I was happy I was free but Texas never fell in love
with me  
I found out my style just didn't suit the local squirrels  
I found out that I can't fit into a cowboy world  
I'm back in Indiana just as lonesome as can be Texas never fell in love with
me  
  
I bought myself a cowboy hat of course it didn't fit  
I bought myself a case of Coor's and I used to drink and sip  
I watch the cowgirls come and go Lord don't they love to play  
The one I wanted never came my way  
I found out my style...  
Texas never fell in love with me

That song is driving me crazy, I gotta hear it again  
First time I heard it I was with some friends  
It's a simple little song you can sing along with an old time melody  
So would you play that crazy little song again for me?  
That song is driving me crazy  
I love that part about break my heart and baby please come home  
And I love that line about hurtin' my mind and my beer ain't got no foam  
That song is driving me crazy  
Well, you'll sing high and I'll sing low and everybody sing along  
But everybody quit while I get my kick singin' bring that boogie home  
Mhm, that song is a driving me crazy  
Okay gang, well, that song is driving me crazy  
That song is driving me crazy  

It's not my sun, man, and if it's not shinin'  
When I wake up tomorrow morning, hmm, that'll be all right with me  
They're not my birds, man, and if they're not singin'  
When I wake up tomorrow morning, hmm, that'll be all right with me  
I don't believe I'm where I'm goin', I find many a mile  
If you don't like me, help me to change I'm still looking for a style  
She's just a woman if she should be gone  
When I wake up tomorrow morning, hmm, that'll be all right with me  
Well, I'm not a brave man but I'm not a slave man  
If all I ever am is free, that'll be all right with me  
I don't believe I'm where I'm goin', I find many a mile  
If you don't like me, help me to change I'm still looking for a style  

If you love somebody enough  
You'll follow wherever they go  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
If you love somebody enough  
You'll go where your heart wants to go  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
I know if you'd seen her you'd tell me 'cause you are my friend  
I've got to find her and find out the trouble she's in  
If you tell me that she's not here  
I'll follow the trail of her tears  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
She would get mad and she used to say  
That she'd come back to Memphis someday  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
I haven't eaten a bite  
Or slept for three days and nights  
That's how I got to Memphis  
That's how I got to Memphis  
I've got to find her and tell her that I love her so  
I'll never rest 'til I find out why she had to go  
Thank you for your precious time  
Forgive me if I start to cryin'  
That's how I got to Memphis (x8)

The Carter boys were born one and after another in a little old country place  
I was the last and the death of my mother and I know it was a pretty bad trace  
We'd get to drinking I'd do the singing and they taught me to chase girls and
cuss  
We played poker I'd do the dealing I was the only one we could trust  
And there were six of us all together and that's how we stood all the time  
Six of us all together the Carter boys were brothers of mine  
We had an old car that we kept tied together with pieces of baling wire and
hope  
Well they knew when we got there and they knew when we left  
They could tell by the noise and the smoke  
Anytime the sheriff had nothing to do he'd get out and chase us around  
The old women prayed the old men laughed and the middle aged people all
frowned  
There were six of us all together...  
Daddy was a preacher and the Lord knows he tried  
Gave us everything he could afford  
We lost a lotta battles but daddy always said the only thing we feared was the
Lord  
Well as I look back through the long lean years I wonder how we ever survived  
All of that hard work all of those women and all of those pistols and knives  
There were six of us all together...  
There were six of us all together...

I don't know why it is every time I take a trip  
It's always raining somewhere down the line  
This particular night was in Prestonsburg, Kentucky  
I stopped to give a country boy a ride  
  
I saw him running toward the car, he carried an old suitcase  
A cigarette was dangling from his lips  
He threw the suitcase in the back and as he got inside  
He said, "I'm sorry, but I'm awful wet."  
  
I said, "Where are you headed, kid?" And he said, "To Louisville"  
Said he had an uncle there who ran a store  
Said his daddy died three weeks ago and they didn't own the place  
And they said he couldn't live there anymore  
  
He said his education was that he could read and write  
He quit school the time his dad got hurt  
Ain't much goes on in Prestonsburg, and he was seventeen  
And he had to go some place to find some work  
  
He talked about the girl whose father had a lot of money  
He said he'd send and get her if he could  
His daddy taught him all there was about tobacco-farmin'  
And he said he played the banjer pretty good  
  
We stopped to get a sandwich and the waitress brought a menu  
And I noticed that he read the prices first  
He ordered him a hot dog with a lot of table ketchup  
And water seemed to satisfy his thirst  
  
Well, it took awhile but I insisted that I pay the ticket  
Excused myself and went out to the car  
He came out, got in the car and handed me a quarter  
And he said, "You left this layin' on the bar."  
  
I dropped him off in Lexington and drove down to Bowling Green  
And I thought, boy you'll never make it without help  
And then I got to thinkin' about the days when I was younger  
And I started out the same darn way myself  
  
Well, I don't know why it is every time I take a trip  
It's always raining somewhere down the line...

I was there on the day the monkey came into this world  
His face was round and reddish and his hair was slightly curled  
He didn't look too different from the others I had seen  
Who'd-a-thought he was the answer to the nation's dream?  
At first he didn't seem to be intelligent at all  
Each time he'd start to walk about he'd stumble and he'd fall  
My first impression was to be a most mistaken thought  
Lord a'mighty, what's this little hairy monkey wrought?  
Because I witnessed his departure from his mother's womb  
I felt inclined to check his progress every afternoon  
One day the keeper of the zoo called in the live TV  
Frankly said, "I think you'll be amazed at what you see"  
The monkey walked and talked and waved his arms about his head  
In the corner was the stack of books that he had read  
"An Educated Monkey!", said the papers 'cross the land  
It was more than weary sociologists could stand  
Oh, his fame was universal, he was on the Carson show  
People talked about him kindly everywhere he'd go  
His insight was amazing, his philosophy was fair  
He became a politician welcome everywhere  
His wit was not to be compared with any mind intact  
He'd lace a phrase with irony and blend it all with fact  
Conservatives applauded and the liberals were entranced  
The bigots and the integrationists were in his camp  
Nobody dared to meet him in an open press debate  
He was nominated by the folks from every state  
Yes, a monkey was the President, though maybe not the first  
And there was peace and harmony throughout the universe  
The dream I had last night has been related as it came  
As for interpretation, well, it's really very plain  
Would you rather have a monkey up in Washington, D.C.  
Or have those people making monkeys out of you and me?

We got too many do goods and not enough hard working men  
We got too many hands out and not enough lendin' a hand  
We got too many thinkers looking for the answer in the wind  
Hey we got too many do goods and not enough hard working men  
We got poets and prophets and some folks are readin' the stars  
If we'd look a little closer to home we might find who we are  
We got all kinds of sermons in booklets and pamphlets on sin  
Hey we got too many do goods and not enough hard working men  
We got too many do goods...  
We got clubs and committees who know all about wrong and right  
Oh but I've seen some children who starved plumb to death on advice  
I appreciate your sympathy and I believe in missionary work  
But a little bit of bendin' down and pickin' up your brother wouldn't hurt  
We got too many do goods...

Have you read any good telephone books lately?  
If you ain't then let me recommend one  
I've already read that Tulsa telephone book through thirteen times  
If you don't know any last names it ain't much fun  
  
Readin' that Tulsa telephone book, can drive a guy insane  
Especially if that girl you're lookin' for has no last name  
I gotta find her and tell her, I don't want our love to end  
So I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again  
  
Well, I was in Tulsa and didn't have anything goin'  
She lived in Tulsa and didn't have anything on  
She said, "My name is Shirley," and I said, "My name is T."  
I woke up the next mornin' and she was gone  
  
All of the Tulsa operators know my voice now  
And they gotta know how long I've been alone  
If you meet a girl named Shirley with some ribbons in her hair  
Would you tell her that she's wanted on the phone  
  
Readin' that Tulsa telephone book, can drive a guy insane  
Especially if that girl you're lookin' for has no last name  
I gotta find her and tell her, I don't want our love to end  
So I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again  
  
I'm readin' that Tulsa telephone book again

Johnny got up one mornin' he went down to the company store  
Got him a big box of bullets to fit into his 44  
The storeman said son are you gonna work you know you owe me too much to stop  
John said I got a little working to do but I ain't goin' by your clock  
  
People said John was a slacker cause he wouldn't fight in their war  
A man wasn't much if he wouldn't fight back in nineteen forty and four  
The doctor said John was just too sick to go  
But the people said that he was a coward  
  
And one of the men makin' fun of him was a feller named a Milton Howard  
Milton was down at the Cold Spring a drinkin' from a Mason jar  
He said John you better get yourself to work you gonna fool around till you
get fired  
John blew the dust from his old 44 put two holes in Milton's head  
  
When Johnny walked off to get some more shootin' done  
That old Cold Spring was a runnin' with red  
Next guy he met was a Steagall boy and the boy had a hammer in his hand  
John said son you should've built yourself a box  
  
'Cause you're aheaded for the Promised Land  
Steagall fell down to his knees to pray and he cried Lord Johnny please don't
shoot  
Before he got half way to sayin' amen well old John shot him out of his boots  
  
Word went out through the County that old John had lost his head  
The people were running and screaming there were seven of 'em layin' there
dead  
Johnny hid out in a farmhouse he had satisfaction in his eyes  
He said I know they're coming to get me boys but they ain't a gonna take me
alive  
  
People gathered round that old farmhouse was the relatives of all them dead  
Now John said if the sheriff comes through that door I'm gonna fill him plum
full of lead  
The sheriff kicked down that old farmhouse door but old John's gun would not
shoot  
Johnny just smiled at the sheriff and said the Lord must think a lot of you  
  
They took old John to the jailhouse he entered in a guilty plea  
The judge said death in the electric chair cause it's murder in the first
degree  
John's last meal was a lot of fried chicken cold beans and a baby squash  
He ate every bite that they brought him then he smiled and said I thank you
all a lot  
  
They put old John in the electric chair they shaved his ankles and his head  
The preacher said son you got something to say in a minute you're a gonna be
dead  
John said I ain't no coward and the people know that I won't run  
Then Johnny smiled up at the warden and said turn it on turn it on turn it on

When I was a young man I busted my jeans hopping a freight down to New Orleans  
Worked on the oil rigs and played in the bars but nothing ever killed me so
far  
Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall and right now you're walking out on
me  
I can hear your footsteps going down the hall  
And I am waitin' on the other shoe to fall  
  
[Fiddle]  
  
Well I joined the army and I did my time they sent me right up to the front
lines  
People were shoutin' and shootin' at me but I had to keep America free  
Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall...  
  
[Dobro]  
  
I've been to California and I've been to New York  
And all in between I had beans on my fork  
Clothes on my back and a song on my mind but I've never met a woman like your
kind  
Now I'm waitin' on the other shoe to fall...  
  
[Fiddle]  
  
Well right down the street there's an old boardin' house  
You better be careful bout throwin' me out  
When she hears my footsteps comin' up their stairs she's gonna start combing
her hair  
She's a waitin' on the other shoe to fall right now you're walking out on me  
I can hear your footsteps going down the hall  
And she is waitin' on the other shoe to fall

My teardrops remind me that I'm water blue  
A conscience too healthy for all I've been through  
The sun shines and I think that I should improve  
But I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
Whiskey in water and salt in my tears too many long nights for too many years  
They say I'll forget you but I never do I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
[ dobro - sax ]  
As blue as an ocean as blue as a lake thinking about you and all my mistakes  
All I ever wanted was my job and you now I'm heartsick and I'm water blue  
I'm heartsick and I'm water blue

Memories light the corners of my mind  
Misty water-colored memories of the way we were  
Scattered pictures of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the chance to do it all again  
Tell me, would we?  
Could we?  
  
Memories may be beautiful and yet  
What's too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
So it's the laughter we will remember  
Whenever we remember  
The way we were  
The way we were

You know they played that melody the first time that you danced with me  
And way back then I didn't even know the words  
Then they played that song again when our love came to an end  
It was the saddest happy song I ever heard  
  
What a song what a song you know I've heard it for so long  
You know it seems to be the theme song from my whole life  
A simple tune simple lines but every time it comes to mind  
I always think oh what a song what a song  
  
Well I don't know who made it up I only know the way it touched  
The very heart and soul of me with every note  
When everything it said and done when all the other songs're sung  
I hope they play the greatest song they ever wrote  
What a song what a song...

You were meant for me and there ain't no two ways about it  
Even on my darkest days oh they couldn't make me doubt it  
Someday things are gonna be the way they were before  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
Leave me I don't worry darling you'll be back  
Honey I'm not bragging I'm just statin' facts  
The ocean always brings each piece of driftwood back to shore  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
  
I know they have you now sweetheart they don't know what they got  
Heaven is still heaven when the weather ain't so hot  
When all is done that will be done you'll knock upon my door  
When nobody wants your body anymore  
Leave me I don't worry...  
Unless somebody wants my body before
