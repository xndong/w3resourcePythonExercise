I've been waiting for years to buy a brand new Cadillac  
But now I've got one, I want to send it right back  
I can't afford the gas to fill my luxury limousine  
But even if I had the dough no one's got no gasoline  
  
I went to my local dealer to see if he could set me straight  
He said there's a little gas going but I'd have to wait  
But he offered some red hot speed and some really high grade hash  
But a gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
  
I can score you some coke and some grade one grass  
But I can't get a gallon of gas  
I've got some downers some speed all the drugs that you need  
But I can't get a gallon of gas  
There's no more left to buy or sell  
There's no more oil left in the well  
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
  
Who needs a car and a seven forty seven  
When you can't buy a gallon of gas  
Who needs a highway, an airport or a jet  
When you can't get a gallon of gas  
There's no more left to buy or sell  
There's no more oil left in the well  
A gallon of gas can't be purchased anywhere  
For any amount of cash  
You can't buy a gallon of gas

He don't need no sedatives to ease his troubled mind.  
At work he is invariably unpleasant and unkind.  
Why should he care if he is hated in his home,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
He's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
  
But he ain't gotta home, oh no,  
And he's as wicked as he can be,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right  
  
Well, he got his job when drunken Daddy tumbled down the stairs.  
From that very day this boy is more than having his share.  
One of these days I'm gonna knock him off of his throne,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
He's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
  
And he's oh so smug, oh yeah.  
He's got everything he needs,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right  
  
And he's oh so smug, oh yeah.  
He's got everything he needs,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
He's gotta house in the country,  
And a big sports car.  
  
But he's socially dead, oh yeah,  
And it don't matter much to him,  
'Cause he's gotta house in the country  
Where he likes to spend his weekend days.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, well all right  
  
House in the country  
House in the country  
House in the country  
House in the country

One on the nose, one on the chin,  
You bruise so easy, so why stay with him?  
He uses you just like a human punching bag.  
But you don't complain, you're too scared to speak.  
Anyway, it only really hurts you when you laugh,  
And when you eat.  
But you can't break the pattern, week after week.  
The bruises show,  
But he must be special otherwise you'd just get up and go.  
You'll never let us know  
Exactly how you feel.  
What's the use, the cynics say it's no excuse,  
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.  
You say it's okay,  
But I say that it's not right.  
You wind him up, but you're living in fear,  
You keep going back but it ends in tears, oh.  
  
That's quite a cut on the side of your head.  
Is it from his fist, or did you really fall out of bed?  
Oh, so uncouth,  
Excuse me, is this your tooth?  
Why do you stay, no one knows.  
Do you really love him, or are you too scared to go?  
You're always nervous and on the edge of tears.  
You cry alone,  
But you never tell us what it's like when you get back home.  
No one will ever know  
Because you never show.  
What's the use,  
Everyone says you've got no excuse,  
You keep running back just to get a little bit of abuse.  
You say it's okay,  
But I say that it's not right.  
Oh, it's your secret, it's your life, who am I to criticize?  
It takes two sides to know it's true,  
And maybe, he'll stay in love with you.  
No one will ever know,  
Because you never show.

Tears would fall like the falling rain,  
There would be a sea.  
But you don't have to cry to prove your love,  
Just believe in me.  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause a little bit of sunlight is all that I want from you,  
A little bit of sunlight,  
Is all that I want,  
All that I want,  
All that I want from you.  
  
A man who can't live with cloudy skies,  
Should only wait and see.  
  
Soon all the clouds will disappear,  
And leave just you and me.  
  
[Chorus]

'Cause he gets up in the morning,  
And he goes to work at nine,  
And he comes back home at five-thirty,  
Gets the same train every time.  
'Cause his world is built 'round punctuality,  
It never fails.  
  
And he's oh, so good,  
And he's oh, so fine,  
And he's oh, so healthy,  
In his body and his mind.  
He's a well respected man about town,  
Doing the best things so conservatively.  
  
And his mother goes to meetings,  
While his father pulls the maid,  
And she serves the tea with councilors,  
While discussing foreign trade,  
And she passes looks, as well as bills,  
At every suave young man.  
  
'Cause he's oh, so good,  
And he's oh, so fine,  
And he's oh, so healthy,  
In his body and his mind.  
He's a well respected man about town,  
Doing the best things so conservatively.  
  
And he likes his own backyard,  
And he likes his fags the best,  
'Cause he's better than the rest,  
And his own sweat smells the best,  
And he hopes to grab his father's loot,  
When Pater passes on.  
  
'Cause he's oh, so good,  
And he's oh, so fine,  
And he's oh, so healthy,  
In his body and his mind.  
He's a well respected man about town,  
Doing the best things so conservatively.  
  
And he plays at stocks and shares,  
And he goes to the regatta,  
And he adores the girl next door,  
'Cause he's dying to get at her,  
But his mother knows the best about  
The matrimonial stakes.  
  
'Cause he's oh, so good,  
And he's oh, so fine,  
And he's oh, so healthy,  
In his body and his mind.  
He's a well respected man about town,  
Doing the best things so conservatively.

The first time that I saw you, you were modestly waiting for a bus  
Now you're driving around in hired limousines  
And you talk so upper class.  
  
The cost is high, but it's not the only price you ultimately pay  
Add it up, you might have got some money  
But you lost me on the way  
  
Add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
  
Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci  
Cartier, Cartier  
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci  
  
Add it up,  
You multiplied and multiplied but what's it leading to?  
Add it up,  
The only thing subtracted is the love I had for you  
So add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
  
Symbols of perversion and insanity  
Symbols of social immorality  
Symbols of economic cruelty  
Symbolize all what you did to me  
  
Ah, Gucci, Gucci, Gucci  
Cartier, Cartier  
Gucci, Gucci, Gucci  
Cartier, Cartier  
  
Money can't cover up the fact you're getting older every day  
And you can't disguise your sad little eyes that give your loneliness away  
  
Add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
Add it up, oh  
(repeat)

Tea time won't be the same without my Donna  
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna  
I think about that small cafe  
That's where we used to meet each day  
And then we used to sit a while  
And drink our afternoon tea  
  
I'll take afternoon tea (afternoon tea)  
If you take it with me (afternoon tea)  
You take as long as you like  
Cause I like you, girl  
  
I take sugar with tea (afternoon tea)  
You take milk if you please (afternoon tea)  
Like you talking to me  
Because you ease my mind  
  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)  
  
Tea time still ain't the same without my Donna  
At night I lie awake and dream of Donna  
I went to our cafe one day  
They said that Donna walked away  
You'd think at least she might have stayed  
To drink her afternoon tea  
  
I'll take afternoon tea (afternoon tea)  
If you take it with me (afternoon tea)  
You take as long as you like  
'cause I like you, girl  
  
I take afternoon tea (afternoon tea)  
Every day of the week (afternoon tea)  
Please come along if you like  
Because I like you, girl  
  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)  
Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba (afternoon tea)

Here is a story about a sinner,  
He used to be a winner who enjoyed a life of prominence and position,  
But the pressures at the office and his socialite engagements,  
And his selfish wife's fanatical ambition,  
It turned him to the booze,  
And he got mixed up with a floosie  
And she led him to a life of indecision.  
The floosie made him spend his dole  
She left him lying on Skid Row  
A drunken lag in some Salvation Army Mission.  
It's such a shame.  
  
Oh demon alcohol,  
Sad memories I cannot recall,  
Who thought I would say,  
Damn it all and blow it all,  
Oh demon alcohol,  
Memories I cannot recall,  
Who thought I would fall a slave to demon alcohol.  
  
Barley wine pink gin,  
He'll drink anything,  
Port, Pernod or tequila,  
Rum, scotch, vodka on the rocks,  
As long as all his troubles disappeared.  
But he messed up his life and he beat up his wife,  
And the floosie's gone and found another sucker  
She's gonna turn him on to drink  
She's gonna lead him to the brink  
And when his money's gone,  
She'll leave him in the gutter,  
It's such a shame.  
  
Oh demon alcohol,  
Sad memories I cannot recall,  
Who thought I would fall,  
A slave to demon alcohol.

Come on pretty baby, don't play hide and seek with me.  
Come on pretty baby, don't play hide and seek with me.

My big day, it was the biggest day of my life.  
It was the summit of my long career,  
But I felt so down, and I drank too much beer,  
And my manager said that I should not appear.  
I walked out onto the stage and started to speak.  
The first night I've missed for a couple of years,  
I explained to the crowed and they started to jeer,  
And just when I wanted no one to be there,  
All of my friends were there.  
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.  
All of my friends were there to stand and stare,  
Say what they may, all of their friends need not stay.  
Those who laughed were not friends anyway.  
All of my friends were there to stand and stare.  
  
Days went by, I walked around dressed in a disguise.  
I wore a mustache and I parted my hair,  
And gave the impression that I did not care,  
But oh, the embarrassment, oh, the despair.  
Came the day, helped with a few last glasses of gin,  
I nervously mounted the stage once again,  
Got through my performance and no one complained,  
Thank God I can go back to normal again.  
I went to that old cafe,  
Where I had been in much happier days,  
And all of my friends were there,  
And no one cared.  
Say what they may, all of my friends were there.  
Not just my friends, but their best friends too.  
All of my friends were there,  
Now I don't care.

I know a place,  
Not far away where the Sun always shines.  
You will be mine,  
And I'll love you.  
  
I know a place where the Sun always shines.  
You will be mine,  
And I'll love you.  
  
Church bells will chime,  
And they will know you are mine.  
All of the time,  
I will love you.  
  
Church bells will chime so they know you are mine.  
All of the time,  
I will love you.  
  
The finest moments in my life,  
Is when you say you'll be my wife.  
  
Church bells will chime,  
And they will know you are mine.  
All of the time,  
I will love you.  
  
Church bells will chime so they know you are mine.  
All of the time,  
I will love you.  
  
Yeah, I'm gonna love you.  
I'm gonna love you,  
I'm gonna love you.

On reflection, it was not all wine on the wall  
It was not all cuts and bruises  
Or the pulling out of hair  
And the bloodying of nose  
And the tearing off of clothes, although  
  
It was really animal, truly animal  
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air  
Though it was really animal, truly animal  
  
It could not compare to times we cared  
And were in control and less emotional  
  
While the intellect controls the spiritual  
The animal respects what's natural  
Ying and yang control man's actions  
And both extremes are a natural reaction  
  
It was really animal, truly animal,  
Well there were times when there was absolute compassion in the air  
  
On reflection it was not all crash and bang  
Broken bottles and abuse  
Sometimes there were sunsets on the sands  
Holding onto caring hands  
But there were vampire fangs  
As the angels sang  
It was ying and yang, oh yeah  
  
It was truly natural, though it was really animal  
In a sense it fell into a truly natural romance  
  
Oh yeah,  
It was really animal, truly animal  
There were times when there was absolute compassion in the air  
  
True love, true love, true love is really animal

You're just an animal in the zoo  
Sittin' round feeling persecuted and abused  
You're locked up and I'm on the loose  
But I can't quite tell who's looking at who  
Cause I'm an animal, too  
But you're locked up in a zoo  
And you look at me and I look at you  
  
God made the heaven and the deep blue sea  
But man picked the flowers and he pulled up the trees  
God mad the moon and the rain and the sun  
But man made the money and the bombs and the guns  
So we're all animals, too  
But you're locked up in a zoo  
And you look at me and I look at you  
  
I'm a prisoner but I got no cage  
I'm locked up but I got no chain  
But the good guys lose and the bad guys win  
That's why you're looking out and I'm looking in  
But we're all animals, too  
But you're locked up in a zoo  
Cause you look at me and I look at you

I think I'm sophisticated 'cause I'm living my life  
Like a good homo sapiens  
But all around me everybody's multiplying and  
They're walking round like flies man  
So I'm no better than the animals sitting  
In the cages in the zoo man  
Cause compared to the flowers and the birds and the trees  
I am an apeman.  
  
I think I'm so educated and I'm so civilized  
'Cause I'm a strict vegetarian  
But with the over-population and inflation and starvation  
And the crazy politicians  
I don't feel safe in this world no more,  
I don't want to die in a nuclear war.  
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman.  
  
I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman  
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodoo man, oh I'm an apeman  
Cause compared to the sun that sits in the sky,  
Compared to the clouds as they roll by,  
Compared to the bugs and the spiders and flies I am an apeman.  
  
In man's evolution he's created the city  
And the motor traffic rumble.  
But give me half a chance and I'd be taking off my clothes  
And living in the jungle.  
Cause the only time that I feel at ease  
Is swinging up and down in the coconut trees.  
Oh what a life of luxury to be like an apeman.  
  
I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman  
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodoo man, oh I'm an apeman  
I look out the window but I can't see the sky,  
The air pollution is a-fucking up my eyes,  
I want to get out of this city alive and make like an apeman.  
  
Oh come on and love me, be my apeman girl  
And we'll be so happy in my apeman world.  
  
I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman  
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodoo man, oh I'm an apeman  
I'll be your Tarzan, you'll be my Jane,  
I'll keep you warm and you'll keep me sane,  
We'll sit in the trees and eat bananas all day, just like an apeman.  
  
I'm an apeman, I'm an ape, apeman, oh I'm an apeman  
I'm a King Kong man, I'm a voodoo man, oh I'm an apeman  
I don't feel safe in this world no more,  
I don't want to die in a nuclear war.  
I want to sail away to a distant shore and make like an apeman

I never knew why I loved you so much  
Maybe it's the way you look at me when you get up in the morning  
I didn't need a shove  
I just fell in love  
With your little baby face  
  
Baby face  
You got the prettiest little baby face  
There isn't another one to take your place  
Baby face  
You got my heart a jumpin'  
You sure have started something  
  
Baby face  
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace  
I didn't need a shove  
I just fell in love  
With your pretty little baby face  
  
You got my heart a-jumpin'  
You sure have started something  
  
Baby face  
I'm up in heaven when I'm in your firm embrace  
I didn't need a shove  
I just fell in love  
With your pretty little baby face  
Pretty little baby face  
Pretty little baby face

I don't want to leave, Bernadette,  
But I don't want to live with the jet set.  
I don't want to leave with you payin' all my debts,  
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.  
  
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.  
You've never done a day's work in your life,  
You've got no incentive.  
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.  
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.  
  
I can't get a job, Bernadette,  
So all that I can offer are a lot of bad debts  
If you marry me, Bernadette,  
You'll lose the alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.  
  
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.  
You've never done a day's work in your life,  
You've got no incentive.  
You've made a career out of punting off all of the men you've slept with.

[Bernadette's got a house in the country,  
She's really got it made.  
Her lawyers made her filthy rich,  
She's got all expenses paid.]  
  
Maybe a famous rock star will fly you away,  
Then you'll eat him all up,  
And spit him out,  
With a dash of Perrier.  
  
And when you've had enough  
You'll throw him away,  
And take him for all you can get.  
Yeah, you like it don't you, Bernadette?  
  
I don't want to leave Bernadette,  
But I want to keep a little bit of self respect.  
I don't want to leave with you paying all my debts,  
With that alimony, palimony, whatever it is you get.  
Ooh, Bernadette, you are so expensive.  
You've never done a day's work in your life.  
You've got no incentive.  
Women like you oughta be locked up

Here's wishing you the bluest sky,  
And hoping something better comes tomorrow.

Follow all the doubt and sadness.  
I know that better things are on the way.  
  
Here's hoping all the days ahead  
Won't be as bitter as the ones behind you.  
Be an optimist instead,  
And somehow happiness will find you.  
Forget what happened yesterday,  
I know that better things are on the way.  
  
It's really good to see you rocking out  
And having fun,  
Living like you just begun.  
Accept your life and what it brings.

The past is gone it's all been said.  
So here's to what the future brings,  
I know tomorrow you'll find better things.

Everybody got the right to speak their mind  
So don't shoot me for saying mine  
Everybody talking about racial equality  
Cause everybody's equal in the good Lord's eyes  
But if I told you that God was black  
What would you think of that  
I bet you wouldn't believe it  
  
There's a self made prophet living right next to me  
He said the Black Messiah's gonna come and set the whole world free  
He looked at me with his evil eye and prophesied  
And he really believed it  
  
He said a Black Messiah is gonna set the world on fire  
And he's no liar, 'cause he has truly heard the word  
Everybody talking about racial equality  
But I'm the only honky living on an all black street  
They knock me down 'cause they brown and I white  
  
Everybody got the right to speak their mind  
So don't shoot me for saying mine  
Everybody talking about racial equality  
You hear everybody talking about equal rights  
But white's white, black's black and that's that  
And that's the way you should leave it  
  
Don't want no Black Messiah to come and set the world on fire  
A Black Messiah is gonna come and rule the world  
Everybody got to show a little give and take  
Everybody got to live with a little less hate  
Everybody gotta work it out, we gotta sort it out  
Everybody got the right to speak their mind  
So don't shoot me for saying mine

You look like a real human being  
But you don't have a mind of your own  
Yeah, you can talk, you can breathe  
You can work, you can stitch, you can sew  
But you're brainwashed  
Yes you are, yes you are  
Get down on your knees  
You've got a job and a house  
And a wife, and your kids and a car  
Yeah, you're conditioned to be  
What they want you to be  
And be happy to be where you are  
Yes you are  
Get down on your knees  
Get down on your knees  
  
The aristocrats and bureaucrats  
Are dirty rats  
For making you what you are  
They're up there and you re down here  
You're on the ground and they're up with the stars  
All your life they've kicked you around and pushed you around  
Till you can't take any more  
To them you're just a speck of dirt  
But you don't want to get up off the floor  
Mister you're just brainwashed  
They give you social security  
Tax saving benefits that grow at maturity  
Yeah, you're conditioned to be  
What they want you to be  
And to do what they want you to  
Yes you are, yes you are  
Get down on your knees

The world's goin' crazy and  
Nobody gives a damn anymore.  
And they're breakin' off relationships and  
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.  
For them it's all over,  
But I'm gonna stay.  
I wouldn't leave anyway.  
I know that someday we'll find a way.  
We'll be O.K.  
  
'Cause I'm your brother,  
Though I don't even know your name.  
I've discovered that,  
Deep down inside, you feel the same.  
Our friends are leavin'.  
Now they seem so far away.  
But we shouldn't feel afraid.  
There's so much that we can say.  
You're my brother,  
Though I didn't know you yesterday.  
I'm your brother.  
Together we can find a way.  
  
The world's goin' crazy and  
Nobody gives a damn anymore.  
And they're breakin' off relationships and  
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.  
The old world's fadin'.  
Now it seems so far away.  
Well, I'm not goin' anywhere.  
There's so much that we can share.  
I'm your brother.  
  
The world's goin' crazy and  
Nobody gives a damn anymore.  
And they're breakin' off relationships and  
Leavin' on sailin' ships for far and distant shores.  
You're my brother,  
Though I didn't know you yesterday.  
I'm your brother.  
Together we can find a way

Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are  
There are stars in every city  
In every house and on every street  
And if you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Their names are written in concrete  
  
Don't step on Greta Garbo as you walk down the Boulevard  
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard  
But they turned her into a princess  
And they sat her on a throne  
But she turned her back on stardom  
Because she wanted to be alone  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Rudolph Valentino looks very much alive  
And he looks up ladies dresses as they sadly pass him by  
Avoid stepping on Bela Lugosi  
'Cause he's liable to turn and bite  
But stand close by Bette Davis  
Because her's was such a lonely life  
  
If you covered him with garbage  
George Sanders would still have style  
And if you stamped on Mickey Rooney  
He would still turn round and smile  
But please don't tread on dearest Marilyn  
Cause she's not very tough  
She should have been made of iron or steel  
But she was only made of flesh and blood  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are  
And those who are successful  
Be always on your guard  
Success walks hand in hand with failure  
Along Hollywood Boulevard  
  
I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk along...  
You can see all the stars as you walk down Hollywood Boulevard  
Some that you recognize, some that you've hardly even heard of  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain  
  
La la la la...  
  
Oh, celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
Oh, celluloid heroes never really die  
I wish my life was non-stop Hollywood movie show  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die

One time I saw you in the street  
Thought that I would be that kind you want  
Ooh babe, you're the best of them all  
  
I'm trying to tell you how much I love you  
Oh baby, please let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all  
  
Then in the dawn I'll be leavin  
[? ]  
Ooh babe, that's the strength of it all  
  
Come on over, and see [? ]  
And let me crawl around on your floor  
Ooh babe, that's the strength of it all  
  
I'm trying to tell you how much I love you  
Oh baby, let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby, that's the strength of it all  
  
I see that I lied, neglected you badly  
Cause you are that one light that's [? ] me blind  
  
All alone I've tried to see  
Then you agree, let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all  
  
Cmon sweety, come over here  
Let me please, [? ] let me climb your wall  
That's the strength of it all  
  
I'm trying to tell you how much I love you  
Oh baby, let me climb your wall  
Ooh baby, you're the best of them all

They put a parking lot on a piece of land  
Where the supermarket used to stand.  
Before that they put up a bowling alley  
On the site that used to be the local palais.  
That's where the big bands used to come and play.  
My sister went there on a Saturday.  
Come dancing,  
All her boyfriends used to come and call.  
Why not come dancing, it's only natural?  
  
Another Saturday, another date.  
She would be ready but she'd always make him wait.  
In the hallway, in anticipation,  
He didn't know the night would end up in frustration.  
He'd end up blowing all his wages for the week  
All for a cuddle and a peck on the cheek.  
Come dancing,  
That's how they did it when I was just a kid,  
And when they said come dancing,  
My sister always did.  
  
My sister should have come in at midnight,  
And my mum would always sit up and wait.  
It always ended up in a big row  
When my sister used to get her own way  
Out of my window I could see them in the moonlight,  
Two silhouettes saying goodnight by the garden gate.  
  
The day they knocked down the palais  
My sister stood and cried.  
The day they knocked down the palais  
Part of my childhood died, just died.  
  
Now I'm grown up and playing in a band,  
And there's a car park where the palais used to stand.  
My sister's married and she lives on an estate.  
Her daughters go out, now it's her turn to wait.  
She knows they get away with things she never could,  
But if I asked her I wonder if she would,  
Come dancing,  
Come on sister, have yourself a ball.  
Don't be afraid to come dancing,  
It's only natural.  
  
Come dancing,  
Just like the palais on a Saturday.  
And all her friends will come dancing  
Where the big bands used to play.

Come on now  
Come on, let the music get you movin'  
Let 'em see that you're not losin'  
See the clock, it's gettin' late now  
Get you coat and fix your face  
  
So come on now (baby come on now)  
Well come on now  
Well it's getting late and we better go  
(It's getting late and we better go)  
  
Come on now  
Come on now while we still got time  
Come on, baby, the sun is shinin'  
Put your coat on and stop your whinin'  
Oh, baby, oh it's all right  
  
So come on now (baby come on now)  
Well come on now  
Well it's getting late and we better go  
(It's getting late and we better go)  
  
Come on now  
Come on now honey and let me see  
Just how much you do for me  
I'm not waiting all night long  
You told me to love you and that's all wrong  
  
So come on now (baby come on now)  
Well come on now  
Well it's getting late and we better go  
(It's getting late and we better go)

Well I woke this morning with a pain in my neck,  
A pain in my heart and a pain in my chest,  
I went to the good doctor and the good doctor said,  
You gotta slow down your life or you're gonna be dead,  
Cut out the struggle and strife,  
It only complicates your life.  
  
Well I cut down women I cut out booze,  
I stopped ironing my shirts, cleaning my shoes,  
I stopped going to work, reading the news,  
I'm sitting twiddling my thumbs 'cause I got nothing to do,  
Minimal exercise,  
To help uncomplicate my life,  
Gotta stand and face it life is so complicated,  
Ladi dah di dahdah, ladi dah di dah dah,  
Got to get away from the complicated life son,  
Life is overated, life is complicated,  
Must alleviate this, complicated life.  
  
Like old Mother Hubbard  
I got nothin' in the cupboard,  
Got no dinner and I got no supper,  
Holes in my shoes I got holes in my socks,  
I can't go to work 'cause I can't get a job,  
The bills are rising sky high,  
It's such a complicated life,  
Gotta stand and face it,  
Life is so complicated.

Some people say that life is a game, well if this is so  
I'd like to know the rules on which this game of life is based.  
I know of no game more fitting than the age old game of cricket  
It has honor, it has character and it's British.  
Now God laid down the rules of life when he wrote those Ten Commandments  
And to cricket those ten same rules shall apply.  
Show compassion and self-righteousness and be honest above all  
And come to God's call with bat and ball.  
  
Now the Devil has a player and he's called the Demon Bowler,  
He's shrewd, he's rude and he's wicked.  
He is sent by Sinful Satan and he's out to take your wicket  
And you know that that's not cricket.  
He'll baffle you with googlies with leg breaks and off spin  
But keep a level head and don't let that demon in.  
So keep a straight bat at all times, let the Bible be your guide  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.  
  
All through your life he'll try to bowl you out  
Beware the Demon bowler.  
He's crafty and deceitful and he'll try to L.B.W.,  
And bowl a maiden over.  
The Devil takes the weak in spirit and so we must always be courageous  
And remember that God is on your side.  
So keep old Satan in your sights and play the straight and narrow line  
And you'll get by, yes you'll get by.

Calling out around the world

A chance for folks to meet

Dandy, Dandy  
Where you gonna go now?  
Who you gonna run to?  
All you life  
You're chasing all the girls,  
They can't resist your smile.  
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.  
  
Checkin' out the ladies,  
Tickling their fancy,  
Pouring out your charm  
To meet all your own demands,  
And turn it off at will.  
Oh, they long for Dandy, Dandy.  
  
Knockin' on the back door,  
Climbing through the window,  
Hubby's gone away,  
And while the cat's away,  
The mice are gonna play.  
Oh, you low down Dandy, Dandy.  
Dandy  
  
Dandy you know you're moving much too fast,  
And Dandy, you know you can't escape the past.  
Look around you and see the people settle down,  
And when you're old and grey you will remember what they said,  
That two girls are too many, three's a crowd and four you're dead.  
  
Oh Dandy, Dandy,  
When you gonna give up?  
Are you feeling old now?  
You always will be free,  
You need no sympathy,  
A bachelor you will stay,  
And Dandy, you're all right.  
You're all right.  
You're all right.  
You're all right.  
You're all right.  
You're all right.

Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
  
I am a dull and simple lad  
Can not tell water from champagne  
And I have never met the queen  
And I wish I could have all that he has got  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
  
And when I lie on my pillow at night  
I dream I could fight like David Watts  
Lead the school team to victory  
And take my exams and pass the lot  
  
(wish I could be)  
Wish I could be like David Watts  
(wish I could be)  
Wish I could be like David Watts  
(wish I could be)  
Conduct my life like David Watts  
(wish I could be)  
  
  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
  
He is the head boy at the school  
He is the captain of the team  
He is so gay and fancy free  
And I wish all his money belonged to me  
I wish I could be like David Watts  
  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
  
And all the girls in the neighborhood  
Try to go out with David Watts  
They try their best but can't succeed  
For he is of pure and noble breed  
  
Wish I could be like  
Wish I could be like  
Wish I could be like  
  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa  
Fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa-fa

Daylight over the Village Green early in the morning.  
Daylight over the hills and valleys heralding the morning.  
Daylight over the mountains, daylight on the Village Green,  
Daylight over the field and the factories.  
Another night has gone away and here comes yet another day.  
  
See the early morning risers walking round with bleary eyes.  
Worn out housewives grit their teeth ignoring new born babies' cries.  
Look at all the busy people this way, that way, everywhere  
Biting toast and swallowing tea and breakfast specials on the air.  
Feel that daylight.  
  
Feel the sunlight on my pillow and it stops my yawing.  
I thank God that I'm still around to see another dawn in.  
Daylight over the valleys, daylight lighting up the trees,  
Daylight over the hillside,  
Smile a smile and sing a song, another night has been and gone.  
  
Middle-aged bankers crack their backs and wish they were young and in their
teens,  
Lonely spinsters dream of dating Roger Moore or Steve McQueen.  
Health fanatics in their attics training for the Empire Games,  
School boys dream of Captain Scarlet, battle ships and aeroplanes.  
  
Feel that daylight, Daylight.  
Daylight on the Village Green,  
Daylight,  
Field and the valleys,  
Daylight.

My makeup is dry and it clags on my chin  
I'm drowning my sorrows in whiskey and gin  
The lion tamer's whip doesn't crack anymore  
The lions they won't fight and the tigers won't roar  
  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
So let's all drink to the death of a clown  
Won't someone help me to break up this crown  
Let's all drink to the death of a clown  
Let's all drink to the death of a clown  
  
The old fortune teller lies dead on the floor  
  
Nobody needs fortunes told anymore  
The trainer of insects is crouched on his knees  
And frantically looking for runaway fleas  
  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
Let's all drink to the death of a clown  
So won't someone help me to break up this crown  
Let's all drink to the death of a clown  
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la  
Let's all drink to the death of a clown

They seek him here, they seek him there,  
His clothes are loud, but never square.  
It will make or break him so he's got to buy the best,  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
And when he does his little rounds,  
'Round the boutiques of London Town,  
Eagerly pursuing all the latest fads and trends,  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
He thinks he is a flower to be looked at,  
And when he pulls his frilly nylon panties right up tight,  
He feels a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
There's one thing that he loves and that is flattery.  
One week he's in polka-dots, the next week he is in stripes.  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
They seek him here, they seek him there,  
In Regent Street and Leicester Square.  
Everywhere the Carnabetian army marches on,  
Each one an dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
His world is built 'round discotheques and parties.  
This pleasure-seeking individual always looks his best  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
  
Oh yes he is (oh yes he is), oh yes he is (oh yes he is).  
He flits from shop to shop just like a butterfly.  
In matters of the cloth he is as fickle as can be,  
'Cause he's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.  
He's a dedicated follower of fashion.

I spy with my little eye  
Anything here that I can buy.  
I see a little thatched cottage  
Looking so neat  
With compulsory purchase we can buy it up cheap.  
Then we'll pull up the floor boards,  
Knock down the walls,  
Rock the foundations,  
Until the house falls.  
Like a pack of cards,  
Crashing to the ground.  
Then we'll build a row  
Of identical boxes  
And sell them all off at treble the profits.  
Demolition.  
  
The deeds are in my pocket,  
I've got a contract in my hand.  
An opportunity for luxury living.  
I'll arrange the mortgage  
To be repaid a hundred percent.  
I can't wait around so make your decision.  
We'll buy up all the cottages  
And every house and every street,  
Until we've got everything we need.  
Every town in the vicinity,  
Every farm and village green.  
We're gonna buy up everything,  
Then it's Demolition.  
Demolition. Demolition.  
  
Two up, two down,  
It hasn't got a garden,  
But it's got a lovely patio.  
Stainless steel kitchen sink,  
Gas fired central heating,  
Whaaa -- specifically designed for modern-day living,  
Nothing's permanent and nothing lasts,  
We've sold all the houses so put 'em up fast.  
We're gonna buy up this town  
And pull it all down.  
How I love to hear the demolition sound  
Of concrete crashing to the ground.  
Demolition.  
  
It's time to make some money,  
It's time to get rich quick.  
It's the wonderful world of capitalism.  
I've got to make a profit,  
I've got to satisfy my greed,  
It's my faith and my religion,  
Demolition. Demolition. Demolition.  
And we'

Down the way from the Tottenham Court Road  
Just round the corner from old Soho  
There's a place where the publishers go  
If you don't know which way to go  
Just open your ears and follow your nose  
'cause the street is shakin' from the tapping of toes  
You can hear that music play anytime on any day  
Every rhythm, every way  
You got to a publisher and play him your song  
He says 'I hate your music and you hair is too long  
But I'll sign you up because I'd hate to be wrong'  
You've got a tune it's in your head you want to get it placed  
So you take it up to a music man just to see what he will say  
He says 'I hate the tune, I hate the words but I'll tell you what I'll do  
I'll sign you up and take it round the street and see if it makes the grade'  
And you might even hear it played on the rock 'n' roll hit parade  
Daytime, night time, every week you can hear that heavy beat  
Now the walls are shaking from the tapping of feet  
Daytime, night time, every day you can hear that music play  
Every rhythm, every way

Met a girl called Lola and I took her back to my place  
Feelin' guilty, feelin' scared, hidden cameras everywhere  
Stop! hold on. stay in control  
  
Girl, I want, you here with me  
But I'm really not as cool as I'd like to be  
Cause there's a red, under my bed  
And there's a little yellow man in my head  
And there's a true, blue, inside of me  
That keeps stoppin' me, touchin' ya, watchin' ya, lovin' ya  
  
Paranoia, need destroyer. Paranoia, they destroy ya'  
  
Well I fell asleep, then I woke feelin' kinda' queer  
Lola looked at me and said ooh you look so weird  
She said man, there's really something wrong with you  
One day you're gonna' self-destruct  
You're up, get down, I'll come work you out  
You get a good thing goin' then you blow yourself out  
  
Silly boy ya' self-destroyer. Silly boy ya' self-destroyer  
  
Silly boy you got so much to live for  
So much to aim for, so much to try for  
You blow it all with, paranoia  
You're so insecure you, self-destroyer  
  
(and it goes like this, here it goes) paranoia, they destroy ya  
(here it goes again) paranoia, they destroy ya  
  
Dr. Dr. help her please I know you'll understand  
There's a time device inside of me I'm a self-destructin' man  
There's a red, under my bed  
And there's a little green man in my head  
And said you're not goin' crazy, you're just a bit sad  
Cause there's a man in ya, knawin' ya, tearin' ya, in to to  
  
Silly boy ya' self-destroyer. paranoia, they destroy ya'  
  
Self-destroyer, wreck your health  
Destroy friends, destroy yourself

Paranoia, they destroy ya (and it goes like this)

Went for a walk down the Old King's Road,  
To see if anybody was there.  
But there was nobody home at 3 Bywater Street,  
And they had sold Cadogan Square.  
And I remember myself in my tie dye sweater,  
And my hipster corduroy flares.  
As I knocked on doors,  
And walked down one-way streets that led nowhere.  
  
Ah, did ya ever think it wouldn't last forever?  
Did ya ever think that it would get this bad?  
Did ya ever think that everything would get so crazy?  
  
Now the Chelsea Drug Store needs a fix,  
It's in a state of ill repair.  
And my Cuban heels are hurting my feet,  
Just to add to my despair.  
La-di-dahs drove Mini cars in the summertime.  
(In the summertime)  
Now they're towed away for parking on a double yellow line,  
And they can't pay the fine.  
(Did you ever think)  
Did you ever think we'd all believe the hype?  
(Did you ever think)  
Did you ever think the classes all would revert back to type?  
(Did you ever think)  
Did you ever think the system ever really got it right?  
Oh, baby.  
  
They filled us full of false illusions and promiscuity,  
And they led us down that class-less road to mediocrity.  
As we walked down that alley way of hope,  
We thought we'd found the motherload,  
But we were led like lambs to that promise land,  
With all the debts that we would owe.  
Once trendies posed for tourist pictures in the summertime.  
(In the summertime)  
Not content with taking Polaroids, they purchased all the property that they
could find,  
And I've just sold mine. (Did you ever!)  
  
Did ya ever think that this green and pleasant land,  
(Did ya ever think)  
Would end up in the bottom of some garbage can,  
(Did ya ever think)  
A dustbin full of promises and half-hearted plans.  
Oh, baby.  
  
Did ya, did ya, did ya ever think?  
Did you ever think?  
(In the summertime)  
  
Now miseries and groaners moan and reminisce about the good old times and
whine, whine, whine.  
(Did ya ever think)  
Did ya ever think when things were really fab,  
(Did ya ever think)  
That we'd be looking through a dustbin for a dog-end to drag,  
(Did ya ever think)  
And sleep on park benches wrapped in plastic bags.  
Oh, baby.  
  
Did ya ever think that it would get this crazy?  
(Did ya ever think)  
Did ya ever think that it would get this way?  
(Did ya ever think)  
Did ya ever think that we would pay the price for being lazy?

Did you see his name in the local paper  
Stole a tin of beans from a cut-priced grocery store?  
The judge said, "He must pay"  
So, he put him on probation and the paper gave his name  
Did you see his name in the criminal section  
And the center page gave his name and his address  
They stopped him doing it again  
So, they put him to dishonour and put the man to shame  
He lost his little job  
His employer was absolved of blame  
His world just crumbled down  
Incidentally, did you see his name in the obiturary column  
Letters edged in black  
Life was much too hard to live  
So, he brought it to an end  
In his gas-filled maisonette  
Because he couldn't stand the strain  
La la la la la  
Life was much too hard to live  
So, he brought it to an end  
In his gas-filled maisonette  
Because he couldn't stand the strain  
Did you see his name?  
Did you see his name?  
Did you see his name?  

Standing in the middle of nowhere  
Wondering how to begin  
Lost between tomorrow and yesterday  
Between now and then  
  
And now we're back where we started  
Here we go round again  
Day after day I get up and I say  
I better do it again  
  
Where are all the people going  
Round and round till we reach the end  
One day leading to another  
Get up go out do it again  
  
Then it's back where you started  
Here we go round again  
Back where you started  
Come on do it again  
  
And you think today is going to be better  
Change the world and do it again  
Give it all up and start all over  
You say you will but you don't know when  
  
Then it's back where you started  
Here we go round again  
Day after day I get up and I say  
Come on better do it again  
  
The days go by and you wish you were a different guy  
Different friends and a new set of clothes  
You make alterations and [a fact in you knows]  
A new house a new car a new job a new nose  
But it's superficial and it's only skin deep  
Cause the voices in your head keep shouting in your sleep  
Get back, get back  
  
Back where you started, here we go round again  
Back where you started, come on do it again  
  
Back where you started, here we go round again  
Day after day I get up and I say, do it agaiiinnn  
Do it again  
Day after day I get up and I say, do it again

Oh, didn't you like to do,  
An uneasy thing to do? [?]  
Are you troubled by the bad things in your life?  
If you're worrying 'bout a verse[?],  
And you can't get it off your chest,  
Just lie down and try to ease your mind.  
If your mother[?] comes 'round the bend,  
Come to give you a helping hand,  
Do you wish to go and bury your head in the sand?  
Oh, do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be the one to understand?  
Oh, do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be a man?  
Oh, do you wish to be a man?  
Well the misery is yours,  
If you hide behind that door,  
If you hide behind the troubles[?] in your life.  
You haven't got a friend,  
And there's no one to take you in,  
Will you come in, stretch[?] and stand up on your own?  
When you know that your time has come,  
And there'll be no place to run,  
There will be no time to bury your head in the sand.  
So, do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be the one to understand?  
Oh, do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be a man?  
Oh, do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be a man?  
Do you wish to be a man?  
Oh, do you wish to be a man?  
  

Don't ever change  
Don't ever change from the way that you are now  
If you ever change  
I would be sad 'cause I wanted you just as you are  
  
Don't you ever change now  
Always be the same now  
No, don't ever change from the way that you were  
Last night  
  
Don't ever change  
What can you prove if you're changing your ways to me?  
Please don't ever change  
Please don't be blind 'cause I need you can't you see?  
  
Don't you ever change now  
Always be the same now  
No, don't ever change from the way that you were  
Last night  
  
Don't ever change  
Don't ever change, I'd be sad  
And I would cry  
If you leave me  
Don't ever leave me  
  
Don't ever change  
Don't ever change from the way that you are now  
If you ever change  
I would be sad 'cause I wanted you just as you are  
  
Don't you ever change now  
Always be the same now  
No, don't ever change from the way that you were  
Last night  
  
Don't ever change  
Don't ever change

Down all the days  
Though the past is just a blink away,  
The future waits for me and you,  
Down all the days to 1992  
  
Here is hope for all the people  
And generations yet to come,  
An the future's bright tomorrow,  
Illuminated by the morning sun.  
Here's for all the working people  
And me the ordinary man  
For assembly workers in the factory  
For farmers toiling on the land  
  
Down all the days  
All nations will unite as one  
A new horizon clear to view  
Down all the days to 1992  
  
So lonely on this island ever since she set me free.  
Breaking out of my isolation  
Reaching out with hands across the sea  
Down all the days, down all the days  
  
Hello my celt and gaelic ladies.  
Bonsoir my green colleen from ireland  
Wilkommen deutch and dutch and dansk  
Gutten tag amour prego ola combien  
  
I'm losing all my bitterness  
It's time to find some happiness  
Around the earth, the sky, the sea  
Down all the days  
  
Bon soir, my little senorita, c'est magnifique  
Au revoir, my little fraulfin baby, it's so tragique  
Achtung parlez vous englese, bon appetit  
Jawohl, mambo italiano, ca va, o.k. i'm on my way  
Down all the days.  
  
Can we heal the wounds of many wars?  
And the battle scars that went before  
Down all the days to 1992  
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992  
Somehow we lost communication  
But i'll find you girl and come back home to you  
Down all the days  
There's gonna be a celebration in 1992  
Somehow we lost communication  
I'll find you girl and come back home to you  
Down all the days.  
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days  
Around the earth, the sky, the sea, down all the days

Drift away, just drift away  
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away  
They say there's gonna be a river of blood  
It's apocalypse now  
  
So we're waiting for the flood  
The ice is gonna melt, the water gonna rise  
And we'll all go to hell  
So they're keeping us advised  
  
While the dollar falls down  
The yen gonna climb  
It's a moral decline  
And I'm losing my mind  
  
I think I'll just drift away  
To that island of my dreams  
Live in total fantasy  
Close my eyes and drift away  
  
Back in the real world  
There's tension everywhere  
And the smell of fear  
Keeps hanging around and polluting the air  
  
The man on the news is going over the top  
Now he'll say anything so his show don't flop  
Wall street's down, so what  
And according to astute market analysis  
  
The world's gonna stop  
They shout the story to the nation  
Pass on the panic to the population  
This is the end of civilization  
It's all over now  
  
[Chorus]  
Meanwhile, I just drift away  
To my island in the sun  
Imaginary paradise, perfection  
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away  
Drift away (drift away)  
Drift away (drift away)  
Drift away (drift away)  
  
Now all the politicians are running out of hope  
They've burned all their bridges  
Now they just can't cope  
And who do we blame now we're all going broke?  
It's that man over there  
Who's hanging from a rope  
Newsmen winding up the nation  
A little bad news helps circulation  
Pass on the panic to the population  
It's all over, it's all over  
It's all over now  
  
Times like this, I just drift away  
To my tropical fantasy  
Living on coconuts growing on the trees  
Sometimes I wish I could just drift away  
Drift away, drift away, drift away  
It's apocalypse now, drift away  
Rivers of blood, drift away  
And the man on the news is going over the top  
  
[Chorus]

Hey, hey, hey...  
Give the people what they want  
  
Well, it's been said before, the world is a stage  
A different performance with every age.  
Open the history book to any old page  
Bring on the lions and open the cage.  
  
Give the people what they want  
You gotta give the people what they want  
The more they get, the more they need  
And every time they get harder and harder to please  
  
The Roman promoters really did things right.  
They needed a show that would clearly excite.  
The attendance was sparse so they put on a fight  
Threw the Christians to the lions, sold out every night  
  
Give the people what they want  
You gotta give the people what they want  
The more they get, the more they need  
And every time they get harder and harder to please  
  
Give 'em lots of sex, perversion and rape  
Give 'em lots of violence, and plenty to hate  
Give the people what they want  
Give the people what they want  
  
When Oswald shot Kennedy, he was insane  
But still we watch the re-runs again and again  
We all sit glued while the killer takes aim

She left a message after the tone,  
I hear it over and over on the answer phone.  
No one can find her, address unknown.  
She just decided to go out and make it alone.  
  
Solo, solo,  
My little child is going solo.  
Solo, solo,  
My little child is going solo.  
  
I feel like crying, I'm in a rage.  
I can't understand why she just ran away.  
What made it happen, guess we'll never know.  
She just decided to go out and make it solo.  
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo.  
  
We work like dogs all of our lives,  
Like millions of other husbands and wives.  
Sent her through college, didn't care what we spent.  
Think of how we feel,  
She didn't say, she didn't ask, she just went.  
  
Solo, solo,  
My little child, you're going solo.  
It's like a pattern, it's like a crime,  
We see it happen time after time.  
You raise your children, you watch them grow,  
Then one day it's good-bye, they've decided they're going solo.  
Solo, solo, solo, solo, solo.  
  
The toys are forgotten, now it appears,  
You've let them down after all of these years.  
Sacrificed all, now there's nothing to show,  
Ungrateful youth, decided you're going solo.  
  
Solo, solo,  
My little child, you're going solo.  
Solo, solo,  
Ungrateful youth, you're going solo.  
  
The obligations, all of the ties,  
Have got to be broken so you can survive.  
Just because they gave you life, they can't stop if you grow,  
Now they can't hold you back 'cause you're going solo

The sky is blue  
But there are clouds in my head,  
With big decisions looming ahead  
The sun is out but  
The room is so grey,  
So much confusion headed my way  
Get positive, try to be gay  
  
News of the world,  
Tea and biscuits in bed  
The headlines said that Diana is dead  
She couldn't act much but she put on a show  
She always smiled  
Even when she felt low  
I used to fancy her a long time ago.  
  
So today has got to be a good day,  
Today is gonna be a good day,  
Today is gonna be a good day,  
Good day, good day, good day.  
  
Holes in my socks  
And I can't find my shoes  
It's no surprise that I'm singing the blues  
So many holes in my life still to mend,  
And someone just said  
That the world?s gonna end  
  
So today better be a good day,  
Today is gonna be a good day,  
Today has got to be a good day,  
Good day, good day, good day, good day.  
  
If we blow away the past  
With a bloody great blast,  
Make it fast, make it fast  
So have a good day today  
Because it could be your last,  
Make it last, make it last  
  
Will it light up the sky?  
Will it blot out the sun?  
Well we've waited this long,  
So it better be a good one  
Good day, good day, good day  
  
Yeah, it's gonna be a good day  
Hey baby, if you come back home  
It'll be a good day today.  
They could drop a small atom bomb  
On the city today,  
But if you walk through that door, honey,  
You know it'll be a good day  
  
And now survival is my only aim  
I call friends and see if any remain  
Who was that girl who used to be my flame?  
I'd call her if I could remember her name  
  
So today is gonna be a good day,  
Today has got to be a good day,  
Today is gonna be a good day,  
Good day, good day, good day, good day  
  
Hey Diana, I've really got to learn  
To take a tip from you,  
Put on my makeup and try  
To make the world take notice of you  
Yeah, it's gonna be good day today  
  
Good day, gonna be a good day  
(repeat)

If a black cat crossed your path, little woman,  
Would you walk along with me?  
Don't have to worry 'bout a thing, girl,  
It's all right, you see.  
'Cause I'm a good luck charm,  
Honey, don't worry 'bout me.  
If you ain't got no money, baby,  
That's all right too.  
As long as you stick to me,  
Some[?] will come to you.  
I'm a good luck charm,  
Honey, don't you worry 'bout me.  
If a black cat crossed your path, little woman,  
Would you walk along with me?  
Don't have to worry 'bout a thing, girl,  
It's all right, you see.  
I'm a good luck charm,  
Honey, don't worry 'bout me.  
I'm a good luck charm,  
Honey, don't worry 'bout me.

I want to lot out of life, but I know my limitations  
Guess I want a lot of things and got my inclinations  
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own  
I don't need no one  
I don't need no one  
  
I've learned a lot out of life, watchin' other folks mistakes  
Funny things that they can get for finding out too late  
I got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own  
I don't need no one  
I don't need no one  
  
Well I don't need nobody else  
All I need's a single ticket  
When I travel on my own  
Not afraid to be alone  
I got my feet upon the ground, and I'm standing on my own  
When I travel far and wide  
And looking for a four leaf clover  
Don't mind if I can't find it, got no chip upon my shoulder  
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own  
I don't need no one  
I don't need no one  
  
Well I don't need nobody else  
All I need's a single ticket  
When I travel on my own  
Not afraid to be alone  
I got my feet upon the ground, and I'm standing on my own  
When I travel far and wide  
And looking for a four leaf clover  
Don't mind if I can't find it, got no chip upon my shoulder  
Got my feet on the ground, and I'm standing on my own  
I don't need no one  
I don't need no one  
(repeat)

Ah, Tom is young and Tom is bold  
Tom is as bold as the knights of old  
But whenever he gets in a bit of a jam  
There's nothing he won't do to get a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And he curses himself for the life he's led  
And rolls himself a Harry rag and puts himself to bed  
  
Ah, Tom's old ma is a dying lass  
Soon they all reckon she'll be pushing up the grass  
And her bones might ache and her skin might sag  
But still she's got the strength to have a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And she curses herself for the life she's led  
And rolls herself a Harry rag and puts herself to bed  
  
Ah, bless you tax man, bless you all  
You may take some but you never take it all  
But if I give it all, I won't feel sad  
As long as I got enough to buy a harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life I've led  
And roll myself a Harry rag and put myself to bed  
  
Ah, the smart young ladies of the land  
Can't relax without a Harry in their hand  
And they light one and they boast and brag  
So content because they got a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
Do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And they'll light one and they'll boast and brag  
So content because they got a Harry rag  
  
Harry rag, Harry rag  
I'll do anything just to get a Harry rag  
And I curse myself for the life I've led  
And roll myself a Harry rag and put myself to bed

You keep on accusing me  
Of making your life misery  
But if that's not abusing me, what isn't  
You wanna be my friend, well it's too late  
My love for you has turned to hate  
And I think that it's a permanent condition  
You say you wanna make the peace  
Smile and turn the other cheek  
I can't put myself in such a weak position  
Now I'm willing to accept this fate  
You and me just can't cohabitate  
We agree to hate and that's our fast decision  
  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that keeps us together  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
  
Driven by hate, driven by hate  
Driven by hate, driven by hate  
On the surface I'm a mild-mannered person  
That's until you scratch the animal inside  
Then you bring out all my animal aggression  
I gotta hatred for you that is never gonna die  
Driven to hate, driven to hate  
Driven to hate, driven to hate  
  
Chorus:  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that keeps us together  
  
While races try to integrate  
Nations try to gravitate  
Towards equal rights, regardless of religion  
Politicians might decree  
For the sake of humanity  
Love and peace instead of a collision  
You and me accept reality  
There's no way that we can agree  
The world can't make us alter this position  
At least you and I know where we stand  
We can't be friends, walk hand in hand  
My hostility for you defies description  
  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that keeps us together  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
  
Driven by hate, driven by hate  
Driven by hate, driven by hate  
Hate's the only thing we have in common  
There's no escape, we'll always be this way  
So we might as well just learn to live together  
Cause we're gonna be this way till our dying day  
Driven by hate, driven by hate  
Driven by hate, driven by hate  
  
Chorus  
  
If you keep on putting me down  
Rub my name into the ground  
I'll drag the dirt all over town about you  
And if you spread the filth on me  
I'll only have one remedy  
I'll spill the beans, you'll see I've got a mouth, too  
  
Chorus (2x)  
  
Yeah, hatred  
Your attitude is downright rude  
Your jokes appall me, they're so crude  
Why don't you just drop dead and don't recover  
I'm the mirror to your mood  
You hate me and I hate you  
So at least we understand each other  
Hatred, hatred is the only thing that lasts, what is it?  
Hatred, hatred  
  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever  
Hatred, hatred  
Is the only thing that lasts forever

Granny's always ravin' and rantin'  
And she's always puffin' and pantin',  
And she's always screaming and shouting,  
And she's always brewing up tea.  
  
Grandpappy's never late for his dinner,  
Cause he loves his leg of beef  
And he washes it down with a brandy,  
And a fresh made cup of tea.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,  
Have a cuppa tea, have a cuppa tea,  
Halleluja, halleluja, halleluja, Rosie Lea  
Halleluja, halleluja, halleluja Rosie Lea.  
  
If you feel a bit under the weather,  
If you feel a little bit peeved,  
Take granny's stand-by potion  
For any old cough or wheeze.  
It's a cure for hepatitis it's a cure for chronic insomnia,  
It's a cure for tonsillitis and for water on the knee.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tea in the morning, tea in the evening, tea at supper  
Time,  
You get tea when it's raining, tea when it's snowing.  
Tea when the weather's fine,  
You get tea as a mid-day stimulant  
You get tea with your afternoon tea  
For any old ailment or disease  
For Christ sake have a cuppa tea.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whatever the situation whatever the race or creed,  
Tea knows no segregation, no class nor pedigree  
It knows no motivations, no sect or organization,  
It knows no one religion,  
Nor political belief.  
  
[Chorus]

Sitting by my stereo all alone  
My baby calls me on the telephone  
She says, baby take me out for a dance  
I tell my baby I feel so bad  
I can't go out and it's making me sad  
But when you see me, I know you will understand  
  
I got hay fever, blocking up my head  
Hay fever, I ought to be in bed  
How can I dance when I can hardly breathe  
Wish I could cure this infernal allergy  
I got, hay fever blocking up my brain  
Hay fever, feel the sinus pains  
And all the pills and the powders are in vain  
Thought I was cured but here it comes again  
It goes ooh-ah  
  
The pollen count's getting higher and higher  
My eyes are sore and my nose is on fire  
My throat's dry now and I'm starting to perspire  
My stuffed up head's killing all of my desire  
I got hay fever, you wicked allergy,  
Hay fever, you put the curse on me  
And I've inhaled every know remedy  
  
I can't stay cool 'cause I'm starting to sneeze  
I can't make love when I can't hardly breathe  
We start to dance and my nose starts to bleed  
There must be a cure for this hay fever  
Is there a pill or a powder I can take  
I must get a cure, for my romance is at stake  
  
Hey fever, you tore my image down  
Hey fever, I must look like a clown  
I must have used every tissue in town  
I'm running round sniffin' like a hound  
It goes ooh-ah  
  
I want to kiss but I'm sneezin' instead  
I can't make love when my head feels like lead  
How can I pose when my nose is all red  
We should be home, should be tucked up in bed  
But I got hay fever  
Hay fever  
  
Hay fever  
Hay fever  
Hay fever

Headmaster, this is my confession.  
This time you won't be overjoyed,  
I have destroyed what little faith you had in me,  
I've been such a naughty boy.  
Headmaster I am at your mercy,  
I've been such a little fool.  
I've dishonored one who trusted me,  
I have broken all the rules.  
I've been with those naughty little girls again,  
Now those naughty little girls are going to put me to shame.  
  
I wish that I'd been born with a little more sense,  
This time it's a serious offense.  
I feel like an Innocent victim,  
I feel that I just can't win.  
Headmaster please give me one chance,  
Please help me to act like a man.  
I've let down the school,  
I've broken all the rules,  
I've let down the side,  
I've committed a crime.  
  
Headmaster, this is my confession,  
I've been such a little fool.  
I've dishonored one who trusted me,  
I have broken all the rules.  
I've been such a little fool.  
Don't tell all my friends I bent over,  
Don't tell them you made me cry.  
Don't tell them I've been sacrificed,  
Don't tell all my friends or I'll die.  
Headmaster don't beat me I beg you,  
I know that I've let you down.  
Headmaster please spare me I beg you,  
Don't make me take my trousers down.

Growing up isn't easy to do,  
Especially for one who always knew,  
You would always come up second best.  
Is that why you have such bitterness?  
  
The apple of your father's eye,  
And always by your brother's side.  
Then a little sister came along,  
And you found all the affection suddenly gone.  
  
But underneath that cold exterior  
I know you've got a heart of gold.  
So aloof, so superior,  
But you've got a heart of gold.  
  
Watch out, don't get caught in the crossfire.  
Watch out, she's still growing up, she's in a rage,  
I guess she's reached that difficult age.  
  
Growing up is very hard to do,  
Everyone watching your every move.  
Your private life always on view,  
But jealously never really suited you.  
But I know that  
  
Underneath that rude exterior,  
There's got to be a heart of gold.  
Underneath that hard exterior,  
Is a little girl waiting to be told,  
You've got a heart of gold.  
She's got a heart of gold.  
  
I couldn't understand your attitude.  
I only wanted to take a photograph of you,  
But I was shocked when I heard what you had to say.  
You picked up my camera, threw it away,  
I didn't really mean to ruin your day.  
  
Now I see you've got a little girl of your own.  
Little princess certainly grown,  
And there's a man, he's smiling at you.  
He must have been the one who always knew.  
You had a heart of gold.  
  
Underneath that rude exterior,  
You've got a heart of gold.  
So aloof, so superior,  
But you've got a heart of gold.  
Underneath that rude exterior,  
You've got a heart of gold.  
Underneath that hard exterior,  
You've got a heart of gold.

I got a letter this morning with serious news that's gone and ruined my day,  
The borough surveyor's used compulsory purchase to acquire my domaine,  
They're gonna pull up the floors, they're gonna knock down the walls,  
They're gonna dig up the drains.  
  
Here come the people in grey they're gonna take me away to Lord knows where,  
But I'm so unprepared I got no time to pack and I got nothing to wear,  
Here come the people in grey,  
To take me away.  
  
Me and my baby's gonna get on a train that's gonna take us away,  
I'm gonna live in a tent, we're gonna pay no more rent we're gonna pay no more
rates,  
We're gonna live in a field, we're gonna buy me gun, to keep the policemen
away.  
  
I'm gonna pass me a brand new resolution,  
I'm gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,  
Gonna beat those people in grey,  
But here come the people in grey,  
To take me away.  
  
The people in grey have gone and taken away my right to voice my complaint,  
Her Majesty's Government have sent me a form I must complete it today.  
But it's making me blue, don't want to tell all my secrets to  
The people in grey.  
  
I'm gonna pass me a brand new resolution,  
I'm gonna fight me a one man revolution, someway,  
Gonna start my rebellion today.  
But here come the people in grey,  
To take me away.  
  
Oh, Lord, those people in grey,  
I gotta get back at those people in grey,  
Here come the people in grey,  
To take me away.

Here comes yet another day, creeping through my window.  
Drank myself to sleep last night, beer stains on my pillow.  
I gotta pull my things together,  
The night can last forever.  
  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.  
Can't even comb my hair or even change my underwear,  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
  
There goes another night, here comes another flight,  
Can't stop gotta go, here comes yet another show.  
Gotta pack up my clothes, brush my teeth, blow my nose.  
  
No time to use the john, gotta keep a rollin' on.  
Here comes a new day, here comes a new stage,  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
  
Made a lot of conversation, talked a lot of weather,  
I hope we meet again some day, and spend some time together.  
No time for affection,  
I'm moving in a new direction.  
  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day,  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.  
Can't stop, can't be late, mustn't make the people wait.  
Can't stop to comb my hair or even change my underwear.  
See that morning break, oh lord, here comes yet another day,  
  
Here comes a new dawn, here comes a new day  
Tune up start to play, just like any other day.

They took my baby, to Holloway jail,  
They took my baby, down Holloway jail,  
She was a lady, when she went in,  
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.  
  
She was succeeding in the city,  
She was just beginning to excel,  
Then a spiv named Frankie Simes  
Led her to a life of crime,  
And led her on the downward trail.  
  
Frankie came home late from work one evening,  
The C.l.D. were hot on his trail,  
Frankie promised everything,  
And then he went and turned her in,  
She went and took the rap for him,  
Now she's impaled in Holloway jail.  
  
They took my baby, down Holloway jail,  
They took my baby, to Holloway jail,  
There ain't no pity, there ain't no bail,  
And she assures me that it's living hell.  
  
She was young and ever so pretty,  
Now she looks so old and pale,  
She never sees the day,  
She wastes her life away,  
Sitting in that prison cell.  
  
They took my baby to Holloway jail,  
They took my baby, down Holloway jail,  
She was a lady when she went in,  
Now she's in jail, and it's giving me hell.  
  
She's impaled, in Holloway jail.

My baby woke me up this mornin'  
She said get down that labor exchange,  
And if you don't come home with a job son,  
You'll get no dinner to-day.  
You gotta secure me a weekly workin' wage.  
You'll get no more fancy cookin',  
You'll get no more apple pie,  
You'll just get those plain hot potatoes  
To satisfy your appetite.  
  
La la la la la la Potatoes,  
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.  
Hot potatoes, yeh,  
I want your lovin' every single day.  
  
I said I don't need your fancy cooking,  
I like the simple things in life,  
Just give me those plain hot potatoes  
And I'll be well satisfied,  
They'll satisfy my appetite.  
  
La la la la la la Potatoes,  
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.  
Hot potatoes, yeh,  
I want your lovin' sixty minutes an hour,  
I want your lovin' twenty four hours a day,  
I want your lovin' seven days a week.  
Yeh, yeh, oh yeh.  
I want your love, I need your love,  
But all I get is hot potatoes  
When I come home late at night  
To satisfy my appetite.  
  
Don't give me no more potatoes,  
Boiled, French fried, any old way you wanna decide.  
Hot potatoes,  
I want your lovin' every single day.  
I want your lovin'  
  
La la la la la la Potatoes,  
Boiled, French fried, any old way that you wanna decide.  
Hot potatoes, Hot potatoes, yeh.

It's been a while, I haven't seen you for at least  
A year or more, or is it less? I can't be sure  
Well, anyway, you must have heard about the  
Troubles that I had, but somehow I got through  
I always managed to... and by the way  
How are you?  
How is your life?  
How is it going?  
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?  
How are the nights are they still lonely?  
Are you still struggling the way that I am? Oh  
How, how are you? How are you?  
  
You always said that you would try to change  
Turn a new leaf and start all over again  
But I bet you're making all the same mistakes  
You're a lot like me, that's why I'm still your friend  
Still no offence, no more hard feelings left on silly sentiment  
No harm was ever felt or ever meant  
You go your way, I'm bound to see you on the street again some day  
And when I do I'll always say  
How are you? How are you?  
  
How is your life? How is it going?  
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?  
How are the nights? Are they still lonely?  
Are you still struggling the way that I am? Oh  
How, how are you? How are you?  
  
I know you're making all the same mistakes  
You're a lot like me that's why I'm still your friend  
I bet go, I gotta thousand little things I better do  
Ah, but it was really good to talk to you  
Be on my way, I'm bound to see you on the street again someday  
And when I do I'll say  
How are you? How are you?  
  
How is your life? How is it going?  
Are you still dreaming and making big plans?  
How are the nights? Are they still lonely?  
Are you still struggling the way that I am? Oh  
How, how are you? How are you?

Living in a world where the flesh is cheap.  
Body touches body but it's only skin deep.  
I can hold you in my arms every time that you weep  
But we've lost that emotional flow.  
Living on a planet full of emptiness  
With maximum exposure full of sleaziness  
But the make up on your face can't disguise loneliness  
Where designer feelings are in vogue, what do they know?  
  
Darlin' Darlin' how do I get close to you when I'm  
Trying, trying my heart is reaching out to you  
How do I get close to you?  
In this world without feeling,  
Where words have no meaning,  
If I were lying, lying,  
I'd have more chance of reaching you but I'm,  
Crying, crying, but I can't get my message through,  
How do I get close to you?  
  
Get close to the sinners trying hard to repent  
Get close to the homeless wasters and the innocent  
Get close to the souls ignored and forgotten by the  
Establishment.  
People get afraid to touch in case it rubs off on them  
Gotta get close, yeah people gotta stay close, close.  
People gotta stay close.  
  
Though we seem together, it's breaking my heart.  
This world is full of barriers that keep us apart.  
Keep it superficial before feelings can start  
In a world that's all glitter and glow, what do they know?  
  
Darlin', darlin', I can't communicate to you without  
Crying, crying, I can't get a message through  
How do I get close to you?  
How can I get close?  
How can I get close?  
Darlin', darlin', how do I get close to you when you're  
surviving surviving in a world that's making us confused  
Guess I'm afraid of losing you.  
In this world without feeling.  
Somehow we gotta stay close.

When I look up from my pillow I dream you are there with me.  
Though you are far away I know you'll always be near to me.  
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.  
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.  
  
I look around me and feel you are ever so close to me.  
Each tear that flows from my eyes brings back memories of you to me.  
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.  
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.  
  
I was wrong, I will cry, I will love you to the day I die.  
You alone, you alone and no one else, you were meant for me.  
When morning comes once more I have the loneliness you left me.  
Each day drags by until finally night time descends on me.  
  
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.  
I go to sleep, sleep, and imagine that you're there with me.

I gotta go now, gotta go now  
I gotta go now, gotta go now  
  
Hey, little girl  
I've gotta go now.  
Hey, little girl.  
I've gotta go now.  
  
Well your mum,  
She's so angry  
Hey, little girl,  
Guess I'd better go now.  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, little girl.  
What you gonna do 'bout it now?  
Hey, little girl.  
What you gonna do 'bout it now?  
Well I love you,  
But I guess I'd better go now.  
Hey, little girl,  
Guess I'd better go now.  
  
I gotta go now, gotta go now  
I gotta go now, gotta go now  
  
I don't want to leave you  
But I guess I'd better go now.  
Soon we'll be together all the time  
But until then I gotta go, gotta go.  
  
I gotta go now, gotta go now  
I gotta go now, gotta go now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I gotta go now, gotta go now  
I gotta go now, gotta go now  
I've gotta go.

I don't want to get left behind  
Gonna love my baby all the time  
If I don't want to get left alone  
I gotta move on down my baby's home  
And if my baby isn't there  
I'm gonna fill my gap and comb my hair  
Gotta move, gotta move  
Gotta move, gotta move  
  
All my life I've had to move  
Always failed to stay in school  
If I moved down [?] road  
Sometimes I wished I'd stayed at home  
Where I'm going no one knows  
Only know I gotta go  
You gotta move, gotta move  
Gotta move, gotta move  
  
I don't want to get left behind  
Gonna love my baby all the time  
If I don't want to get left alone  
I gotta move on down my baby's home  
And if baby isn't there  
I'm gonna brush my boots and comb my hair  
I gotta move, gotta move  
I gotta move, gotta move

It was a matter of fact that when I paid all my tax  
I held my world in the palm of my hand  
And all of my debts were causing me to defect  
To a land of bananas and sand  
So I ran, yes I ran, yes I ran to a foreign land  
Here I am, here I am  
Here I am in a foreign land  
  
I'm so glad we made it  
I thought we'd never land  
I grabbed all my cash  
And decided to dash far away  
Far away, far away to a foreign land  
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land  
  
Goodbye to all of the rich man's daughters  
Goodbye to my debts now I'm 'way cross the water  
Far away, far away in a foreign land  
Here I am, here I am here I am in a foreign land  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la  
  
Please tell my mother and all my ex-lovers  
That I've finally made the grade  
  
Please tell my debtors and the money collectors  
That all of my bills will be paid some day  
I'm away, I'm away, far away in a foreign land  
  
Goodbye champagne and caviar set  
I want to slum and drink all the rum I can get  
I'm away, I'm away in a foreign land  
Here I am, here I am, here I am in a foreign land  
But I'm all out of my jack and I can't go back  
I'm away, far away, far away in a foreign land  
  
La la la la la la  
La la la la la la

[Chorus]  
I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah.  
I've got that feeling, it's her, oh yeah-ah-ah.  
  
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,  
I love her, I love her.  
When we kiss ? show,  
But I love her, I love her.  
  
She is the sweetest girl I know.  
And when she kisses me I know.  
Whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She's got a crazy way of kissing while we're talking  
And I love her, I love her.  
She makes my heart start a-bumping and a-jumping  
Cause I love her, I love her.  
  
She is the sweetest girl I know.  
And when she kisses me I know.  
Whoa  
  
Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know,  
I love her, I love her.  
When we kiss ? show,  
But I love her, I love her.  
  
She is the sweetest girl I know.  
And when she kisses me I know.  
Whoa  
  
[Chorus]

Who's the fool with the cross-eyed stare,  
The turned up nose and moronic glare?  
Who's that simpleton standing over there?  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
Who's that dumb-looking freckle-faced runt?  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
He walks like his feet are on back to front,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
When he waddles down the street he looks kind of queer,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce,  
'Cos he's got two left feet and taxi-door ears,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
And when we laugh at the clothes he wears,  
Jack just smiles 'cos he don't care  
He's a fool! He's a ninny!  
He's a twit! He's a chump!  
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce  
  
Who is always the bottom of the class?  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
Who's a fool? Who's a boob?  
Who's a kook and an ass?  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
When we take examinations he never gets a pass,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
And we all put him down 'cos he can't think fast,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
We ridicule him and punch him around,  
But Jack just laughs and stands his ground,  
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce  
  
Yeah, he's so uncoordinated  
Whoa, and so disorientated,  
And when we have a High School Hop  
You ought to see that idiot bop  
And his arms and his legs  
Seem to have minds of their own,  
And you don't need brains  
To have educated muscles and bones  
  
Yeah, you ought to see him dance  
He moves like he's in a trance,  
And when we have a High School Hop  
You ought to see that idiot rock,  
And he's finally proved  
That you don't need a high I.Q.  
To make your body move  
Now he's created a dance that everybody's trying to do  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
Do the Idiot Dunce  
All right put your finger on your nose,  
Now cross those eyes  
Put your hands on your hips,  
Now wriggle your backside  
Yes, we got you dancing  
To the Idiot Jack  
From your head to the tips of your toes  
  
Now the whole world's doing it and everybody knows,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
He's a real cool cat and a real gone groove,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
And the girls go crazy when he starts to move,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
Now Jack's a success he's got nothing to prove,  
Jack, Jack the Idiot Dunce  
  
Even though Jack is dim  
His mother is so proud of him  
Hey, who's that groovy looking dude  
Dancing with all the chicks?  
The Idiot Dunce, the Idiot Dunce

There's a lady plays her fav'right records  
On the jukebox ev'ry day.  
All day long she plays the same old songs,  
And she believes the things that they say.  
  
Other ladies like to prance around  
And flirt and dance the whole night through,  
But she just sits and listens to here juke box records,  
'Cause that's all that she wants to do.  
  
She sings along with all the saddest songs,  
And she believes the stories are real.  
She let's the music dictate the way that she feels.  
  
It's only juke box music,  
Only juke box music.  
It's only music,  
Only juke box music,  
Only juke box music.  
  
Seems to me she's in a fantasy.  
She's livin' in a world of her own.  
And we all agree that she's a mystery,  
Because she'd rather be all alone.  
  
Ev'ry guy will do his best to try  
To put that music out of her head.  
Forget all the songs,  
And just dance to the music instead.  
  
It's only juke box music,  
Only juke box music.  
It's only music,  
Only juke box music,  
Only juke box music.  
  
It's all because of that music  
That we're slowly driftin' apart.  
But it's only there to dance to,  
So you shouldn't take it to heart.  
  
Music, only juke box music.  
Only music, only juke box music.  
(repeat)

One two three four  
  
Never been anywhere, south of the Delaware  
Never been through Kalamazoo  
Never been to Timbuktu  
  
Livin' is fantasy, travelin' mentally  
Makin' up tunes in hotel rooms  
'Bout places I've never been to  
  
Though I've never crooned under a Kentucky moon  
  
I had my dream, Kentucky moon  
But it's only moon dreams  
From songs, films and TV  
  
But I can visualize, what I've never seen?  
But I had my dream, Kentucky moon  
  
Route sixty six to me is still a mystery  
And Ohio, too  
Went Chicago blue down to St. Louis blues  
  
Never been anywhere, south of the Delaware  
Never been through Kalamazoo  
Never been to Timbuktu  
  
But I can visualize, what I've never seen?  
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon  
  
As I sit by a stream in the moon  
But it's just imagery  
From songs, films and TV  
  
But I can visualize, what I've never seen?  
So I sit and dream, Kentucky moon

Everybody's going somewhere  
See how they stand in line  
All complaining their lives are unfair  
Too bad for them, too bad for mine  
  
(It's the killing time) From now till then  
(Killing time), Not knowing when  
  
They're watching me, I'm watching them  
Standing by the empty mine  
(Killing time)  
  
It's a killing time  
I know it well  
Killing time  
Until the bell  
Too late to change, too soon to tell  
And in between, the killing time  
(Killing time) Giving me hell  
  
Up above the stars still shine  
Through the poverty and grime  
Of the empty streets below  
Killing time, nowhere to go  
(Killing time)  
  
Tell me, brother what's the plan?  
Will I be a working man?  
And occupy my idle mind  
Or kill the time I knew so well  
(Killing time) Giving me hell  
  
Still I can smile at what I see  
Soap operas full of vanity  
So much wealth and property  
Side by side with petty crime  
  
Is that all life's meant to be?  
Commercials full of luxuries  
A man has one, a cat has nine  
And in between it's killing time  
(Killing time)  
  
It's a killing time  
I know it well  
Too late to change  
Too soon to tell  
  
Still I can smile at what I find  
Waiting round and killing time  
Bite the bullet  
Help me through it  
These lunatics will take my mind  
Why can't life be more sublime  
Than all of this waste and killing time  
  
Killing time  
I know it well  
It's the killing time

Marriage is a two-headed transplant,  
Sometimes that's how it seems.  
When the sex wears off it's all give and take,  
And it's good-bye to all your dreams.  
One head wants to go to a movie  
While the other wants to stay at home,  
And just like a two-headed transplant  
You get the feeling that you're never alone.  
  
Mr. and Mrs. Horrible are an example of what I say.  
They used to be so in love, now they fight so much  
That they've frightened all their friends away.  
They never get visits from neighbors,  
They've alienated everyone.  
And what started off as all cuddles and kisses  
Has finally become  
  
A labor of love, labor of love.  
The torment, the worry and woe,  
Love's full of fears, bruises and tears,  
That's the way that a true love grows.  
It's a labor of love, labor of love.  
It's a struggle, without a doubt,  
But if they keep on trying, screaming and crying,  
Somehow they're gonna work it all out.  
  
It turned into a two-headed transplant,  
But it started off with

I want to walk eternity,  
In through the land of make believe.  
And watch the clouds roll over me,  
And let the sun shine down on me.  
The only place that I want to be,  
Lavender Hill for me.  
Wish I could live on sugar and milk,  
Then I could live on Lavender Hill.  
Then I could raise my head to the sky,  
And let the sun saturate me with love.  
I want to walk you up Lavender Hill,  
Everybody loves Lavender Hill.  
Even the bird that sits in the tree,  
Seems to sing sweet melodies.  
Even the breeze is whispering,  
Lavender Hill for me.  
While people eat their biscuits with tea,  
They dream of daffodils that sway in the breeze.  
And every Sunday afternoon,  
Tidy ladies shine their shoes.  
And every little lady dreams,  
Lavender memories.  
Lavender Hill for me.  
Lavender Hill for me.  
I want to walk you up Lavender Hill.  
I want to walk you up Lavender Hill.

Lazy old sun  
What have you done to summertime?  
Hiding away  
Behind all those misty thunder clouds  
I don't mind  
To spend my time  
Looking for you  
For you are my one reality  
When I'm dead and gone  
Your light will shine eternally  
Sunny rain, shine my way  
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun  
You make the rainbows and you make the night disappear  
You melt the frost so I won't criticize my sun  
When I was young  
My world was three foot, seven inch tall  
When you were young  
There was no world at all  
Sunny rain, shine my way  
Kiss me with one ray of light from your lazy old sun  
Lazy old sun  
Lazy old sun  
Lazy old sun

Ever since I was a child,  
I loved to wander wild  
Through the bright city lights,  
And find myself a life I could call my own.  
It was always my ambition  
To see Piccadilly,  
Ramble and roam around Soho  
And Pimlico and Savile Row,  
And walk down the Abbey Road.  
So I saved all my money  
And packed up my clothes,  
And I said good-bye to my friends  
And my folks back home.  
And I left for a life of my own.  
I left for a life on the road.  
  
I'm a real hungry tyke,  
And I know what I like.  
And I know where I'm goin':  
To those bright city lights.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah,  
This time I'm gonna get there.  
I'm bound for a life on the road.  
Give me life on the road.  
I said life on the road.  
  
When I arrived in Euston,  
I was little more than a child.  
And I didn't know then  
That the dives and the dens  
Would be so vulgar and wicked and wild.  
Mama always told me  
The city ladies were bawdy and bold.  
And so I searched night and day  
To catch a kissable lady,  
But all that I caught was a cold,  
'Cause those stuck-up city ladies  
Didn't notice me walk by.  
Now I've got holes in my shoes  
'Cause I've been walkin' the streets all night.  
And I'm livin' the life that I chose.  
Livin' my life on the road.  
I said life on the road.  
I want life on the road.  
Life on the road.  
  
I was standing with the punks in Praed Street,  
When a muscle man came my way.  
He said,

I've gotta get a train, take me back home again,  
See my daddy, momma wants to see me too.  
I'm gonna see my momma looking through the window  
At the station in the morning, been a few mornings since I've been home.  
  
I've been doing wrong but now I'm going home.  
So come on girls, you better put your best boots on.  
Cause when I get home to Lincoln county,  
Won't know which way to go, I'm gonna find all those pretty girls.  
I'm gonna find them all.  
Cause when I get home to Lincoln county,  
Gonna lift the lid off hell, drink some beer, I'm gonna live it swell[?].  
Then I'm gonna shout for more.  
  
Well, I bought a new suit at the best pawn broker's shop,  
Bought my ticket from money that I saved in jail.  
I got a boot lace tie, I got for my pa,  
I got a head scarf, fair, I got for my momma that she won't wear.  
  
I've been doing wrong but now I'm going home.  
So come on girls, you better put your best boots on.  
  
Cause when I get home to Lincoln county,  
Won't know which way to go, I'm gonna find all those pretty girls.  
I'm gonna find them all.  
Cause when I get home to Lincoln county,  
Gonna lift the lid off hell, drink some beer, I'm gonna live it swell[?].  
Then I'm gonna shout for more.  
  
I've gotta get a train, take me back home again,  
See my daddy, momma wants to see me too.  
  
Cause when I get me back to Lincoln county,  
Gonna lift the lid off hell, drink some beer, I'm gonna live it swell[?].  
Then I'm gonna shout for more.  
Cause when I get back to Lincoln county,  
Gonna lift the lid off hell, drink some beer, I'm gonna live it swell[?].  
Then I'm gonna shout for more.  
Cause when I get home to Lincoln county

Well I met her accidentally,  
In a little discotheque.  
And she acted oh so friendly  
To every fella that she met.  
And her hair was hanging down,  
Like a bright and silver machine[?].  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing night and day.  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing, dancing on.  
Although she looked so happy,  
There was sadness in her eyes.  
And her curly false eyelashes  
Weren't much of a disguise.  
And her bright and golden hair,  
Was not all that it might seem.  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dances sadly on.  
Yes Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing, dancing on.  
There was something missing  
From her carefree little life,  
And she'll never understand you  
When you're kissing her good night.  
'Cause the only boy she had  
Went and coolly stepped aside.  
And Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Might as well have died.  
Little Miss Queen of Darkness  
Dancing, dancing on.

Have you heard about trouble throughout the land  
With the fascists and the left wing militants  
Out of work executives are killing themselves  
And the I.R.A. are killing everybody else  
Don't panic, don't lose control  
Keep your head, keep ahold  
Act normal there's nothing wrong  
Stay cool, just carry on  
  
You gotta live life and be yourself  
You can't live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life that's all you do  
Nobody gonna live your life for you  
  
Don't get depressed when you read in the press  
About world revolution and social unrest  
Try not to panic when you switch on the news  
And see crooked politicians and the unemployment queues  
It's only life it's really fine  
So don't you believe all you read in the headlines  
Live life see it through  
Carry on it's all you can do  
  
You gotta live life for yourself, can't live for anyone else  
You gotta live life, that's all you do  
Nobody gonna live their life for you  
  
Extra verse from long version  
Trendy intellectuals always take action  
For every cause that's ever been in fashion  
Weekend revolutionaries protest and sing  
Because they're dedicated followers of any old thing  
They got every solution for every revolution  
They live in the slums just like the poor people do  
But they'd rather sniff coke instead of glue  
Right-wing fascists beat up the blacks  
Then they salute the Union Jack  
You can't pretent there's nothing wrong  
It's not the end, so just carry on  
  
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother  
Oh, life's a mother, oh, life's a mother  
  
You gotta live life for yourself, can't live life for anyone else  
You gotta live life

Spent last winter playing in the sand  
With the prisoners of the motherland  
Damn hotel is feeling like a cell  
  
And even paradise can be so cruel  
Sitting by the swimming pool  
Trying to keep my head together  
In that hot Australia weather  
  
Three days to kill and my per diem's getting low  
Cause I spent all my money calling long distance  
Calling long distance, such a long way from home  
  
Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?  
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,  
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance  
  
Now the Road Hog's face is turning red  
Larry's still asleep in bed  
Romeo he can't get no head at all  
And the Doctor looks on so annoyed  
You disappoint me, Mr. Boyd  
And the Electric Dwarf wishes he was six foot tall  
  
Now Romeo's patience is wearing thin  
C'mon baby, let me in  
It's five a.m. and I've been creeping 'round the hall  
Got no resistance calling long distance  
You sound so close but your such a long way from home  
  
Am I talking to long distance, can you put me through?  
Twelve thousand miles but I've got not resistance,  
Long distance, long distance, long distance, long distance  
  
Still no points for my merrymen,  
Except Ricard, he just scored ten  
Now Road Hog's getting drunk again  
And I only get to hold my pen  
Instead of what I love to hold the most.  
  
I feel so lonesome I could cry  
Count the hours as they roll by  
It's day time now  
I think I'll make a call  
  
Hello long distance, calling long distance  
You sound so close but you're such a long way from home  
You're such a long way from home

Look through any doorway,  
Each life will tell it's story.  
See the joy and heartbreak,  
For all the world to see.  
She's on the city streets,  
On her face is desolation.  
Just a kid from out of town,  
In the land of hope and glory.  
Look through any doorway,  
Each life will tell it's story.  
See the joy and heartbreak,  
For all the world to see.  
Open up your heart.  
Open up the highway,  
The road will stretch before you,  
For there will be a new day,  
Where love will show the way.  
Only shadows of the world we left behind,  
Open up your heart,  
Many shadows of the past, so don't look back.  
Look at the wars,  
A part of greed affects us all  
There's a better way, despite what they do or say,  
People of the world.  
Look through any doorway,  
Tell me what you see.  
Open up your heartache,  
And love will show the way.  
Searching for the way,  
Through all the doubt and sorrow.  
Days turn into years,  
But we'll build a new tomorrow.  
Look through any doorway,  
Each life will bear its treasure.  
Open up your heartache,  
And love will show the way.  
All the shadows of the world we left behind,  
Open up your heart.  
Many shadows of the past, so don't look back,  
Open up your heart.  
Open up your heart.  
Look through any doorway,  
Tell me what you see.  
Look through any doorway.

On the ship, I dream she there.  
I smell the rose that's in her hair.  
  
Louie Louie, oh baby, I gotta go.  
Yi-yi-yi-yi-yi

I'll have some clam chowder, followed by beef steak on rye  
Pumpkin pie, whipped cream and coffee  
I wanna green salad on the side  
Don't forget the french fries  
Pizza pie, garlic and anchovy  
I keep burning up calories as fast as I keep putting them down  
Eat food, put it in my mouth  
Chew it up, swallow it down  
I'll have two eggs, over light, home made apple pie  
Cole slaw as a side order  
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, eat food to sustain a non-stop high-grade
performer  
The pace is continual, sure keeps running me down  
Don't you know that you gotta eat food  
Don't you know that you gotta refuel  
I'm a maximum consumption, super-grade performer  
High powered machine  
Go steady on my clutch, go easy on the hills  
And you'll get a lot of mileage out of me  
I'm so easy to drive, and I'm an excellent ride  
Excessive living sure keeps running me down  
You've got to learn to use the maximum juice  
That's how you get the maximum use  
Life keeps using me, keeps on abusing me, mentally and physically  
I gotta stay fit, stay alive, need fuel inside, eat food to survive  
Maximum consumption sure keeps running me down  
Don't you know that you gotta eat food  
Don't you know that it's good for you  
I'm a maximum consumption  
Non-stop machine  
Total automation perpetual motion

But don't that ol' moon look lonesome when your baby's not around

Cause when I look at you I'm looking through the mirror of love.  
Oh the mirror of love and you look alright,

You're such a cool lover,  
But you're such a cruel lover,  
Treat me like I'm a fool,  
I hate you but you know I would kill for you.

You've been sleeping in a field but you look real rested  
You set out to outrage but you can't get arrested  
You say your image is new, but it looks well tested  
You're lost without a crowd yet you go your own way  
  
You say your summer has gone  
Now the Winter is crawlin' in  
They say that even in your day  
Somehow you never could quite fit in  
Though it's cold outside  
I know the Summer's gonna come again  
Because you know what they say  
Every dog has his day  
  
You're a misfit, afraid of yourself, so you run away and hide  
You've been a misfit all your life  
Why don't you join the crowd  
And come inside  
You wander round this town like you've lost your way  
You had your chance in your day  
Yet you threw it all away  
But you know what they say  
Every dog has his day  
  
Look at all the losers and the mad eyed gazers  
Look at all the looneys and the sad eyed failures  
They're giving up living 'cause they just don't care  
So take a good look around  
The misfits are everywhere  
La la la la la la  
  
You're a misfit  
Afraid of yourself so you run away and hide  
You've been a misfit all your life  
But why don't you join the crowd and come inside  
You wander round this town  
Like you've lost your way  
You had your chance in your day  
Yet you threw it all away  
Now you're lost in the crowd  
Yet, still go your own way  
  
This is your chance, this is your time  
So don't throw it away  
You can have your day  
Yes it's true what they say  
Every dog has his day

Have you seen this face?  
Does it ring a bell?  
Does it strike a chord somewhere in your mind?  
And there's a big reward,  
If you help us solve this crime,  
And if you recognize this face, dial nine nine nine.  
  
Have you seen this face?  
Dig deep in your mind.  
Has anybody seen that little girl of mine?  
She was always a rover,  
But I'm afraid to say she's strayed  
Too far this time.  
  
Now I'm sitting at home, staring at the wall.  
Waiting for the missing person to call.  
Waiting for the message I'm dreading to hear.  
Waiting to confirm my darkest fears.  
She's a missing person, I wish I could see  
All of the places she might be.  
Maybe I stopped her from being free.  
Maybe there was something missing in me.  
  
Wherever she is, I hope she's doing fine,  
But I wish that she would phone or drop us a line.  
Till then I've got nothing to ease my mind,  
And I'm thinking about her all the time.

Well Mr. Churchill says, Mr. Churchill says  
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end  
Mr. Beaverbrook says we gotta save our tin  
And all the garden gates  
And empty cans are gonna make us win  
We shall defend our island  
On the land and on the sea  
We shall fight them on the beaches  
On the hills and in the fields  
We shall fight them in the streets  
Never in the field of human conflict was so much owed to so few  
Cause they have made our British Empire  
A better place for me and you  
And this was their finest hour  
Well Mr. Montgomery says  
And Mr. Mountbatten says  
We gotta fight the bloody battle to the very end  
As Vera Lynn would say  
We'll meet again someday  
But all the sacrifices we must make before the end  
Did you hear that plane flying overhead  
There's a house an fire and there's someone lying dead  
We gotta clean up the streets  
And get me back on my feet  
Because we want to be free  
Do your worst and we'll do our best  
We're gonna win the way that Mr. Churchill says  
Oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! oh! Well Mr. Churchill says  
We gotta hold up our chins  
We gotta show some courage and some discipline  
We gotta black up the windows and nail up the doors  
And keep right on till the end of the war

Hey, Mr. Reporter,  
How 'bout talking about yourself?  
Do you like what you're doing,  
Or is it that you can do nothing else?  
  
Hey, Mr. Reporter,  
I'll believe all that you put down.  
I'll believe the sun is going up,

Hey, Mr. Reporter,  
How 'bout talking about yourself?  
Do you like what you're doing,  
Or is it that you can do nothing else?  
  
Did your daddy stop you playing  
With your friends when you were young?  
And is that why you run down  
All the young folks have their fun. ?  
  
The reason I am stupid,  
Is because I read you every day.  
You misquote all of the true things  
Because they rub you the wrong way.  
  
Hey, Mr. Reporter,  
How 'bout talking about yourself?  
Do you like what you're doing,  
Or is it that you can do nothing else?

But every time you see me you walking away from me.  
I've been gone for such a long, long time,  
But i'm coming home, gonna make you mine.  
  
Hey, mr. cake baker's daughter,  
Hey, mr. bread baker's daughter,  
I'm coming home today.  
Don't hide the world[?] away.  
  
Every time i see you i wanna say "hey".  
But every time you see me you walking away from me.  
I've been gone for such a long, long time,  
But i'm coming home, gonna make you mine.  
  
How is that fresh morning feeling?  
How is the dawn and the evening?  
I will be free today.  
Hey, mr. shoemaker's daughter,  
Hey, mr. shoemaker's daughter,  
I'll see you soon today.  
  
Hey, mr. dress maker's daughter,  
Hey, mr. green seller's daughter,  
Don't throw my love away.

Well I said goodbye to Rosie Rooke this morning,  
I'm gonna miss her bloodshot alcoholic eyes,  
She wore her Sunday hat so she'd impress me,  
I'm gonna carry her memory 'til the day I die.  
  
They'll move me up to Muswell Hill tomorrow,  
Photographs and souvenirs are all I've got,  
They're gonna try and make me change my way of living,  
But they'll never make me something that I'm not.  
  
Cause I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy,  
But my heart lies in old West Virginia,  
Never seen New Orleans, Oklahoma, Tennessee,  
Still I dream of the Black Hills that I ain't never seen.  
  
They're putting us in little boxes,  
No character just uniformity,  
They're trying to build a computerized community,  
But they'll never make a zombie out of me.  
  
They'll try and make me study elocution,  
Because they say my accent isn't right,  
They can clear the slums as part of their solution,  
But they're never gonna kill my cockney pride.  
  
Cause I'm a Muswell Hillbilly boy,  
But my heart lies in Old West Virginia,  
Though my hills are not green,  
I have seen them in my dreams,  
Take me back to those Black Hills,  
That I have never seen.

Hey, I never met a girl like you before.  
Yeah, I never met a girl like you before.  
Girls like you are very hard to find.  
  
Hey, I never met a girl that I could miss.  
Yeah, I never met a girl that I could kiss.  
Girls like you are very hard to find.  
  
When I kiss you,  
I kiss your lovely lips.  
When I hold you,  
You got one hand I want to hold.  
  
Girl, I never met a girl like you before.  
Yeah, I never met a girl like you before.  
Girls like you are very hard to find.  
  
Hey, I never met a girl like you before.  
Yeah, I never met a girl like you before.  
Girls like you are very hard to find.  
To find, to find, you're mine...

Ein, zwei, drei, vier  
I wake up in the morning  
Looking at the street below.  
Oh, the aggravation down below.  
It's no coincidence at all.  
The war is over,  
But the battle has just begun.  
It's still going on,  
Still going on.  
Why?  
Mass migration of people,  
Lithuania, estonia, czechoslovakia, poland,  
Refugees from all over the european continent.  
All traveling to america,  
The land of the free.  
All traveling to america,  
To the great city.  
Life in the city  
Started to get me down.  
Everybody pushin' and shovin',  
Aggravation all around.  
Aggravation.  
C'mon  
C'mon  
Oh baby  
[? ]  
Have you had enough?  
Have you had enough of all this aggravation?  
Fifty years ago this year,  
It was fifty years ago this year,  
When the aggravation begun.  
It's still going on.  
Ein, zwei, drei, vier  

If, if I could see  
Just how lonely my life would be  
If you passed me by and said farewell  
And there is no return  
  
Stars would shine no more  
I would walk up and down this lonely room  
I would have friends, but be alone  
For there is no return  
  
For you were my first love  
And now it looks like you've gone  
And I have waited too long  
  
For if, if I could see  
Just how lonely my life would be  
If you passed me by and said farewell  
And there is no return  
There is no return

I can't understand why everybody's quarreling,  
Nobody gives in case they lose face,  
And everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,  
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.  
It's the same throughout all history,  
Nobody gives unless they receive,  
And nobody trusts or is willing to believe  
And nobody gives or is willing to concede.  
Back in nineteen hundred and twenty-five  
There were thousands of people struggling to survive.  
There was hunger, unemployment and poverty,  
Then in 1926 they decided to be free  
So they all went on strike and  
The workers told the unions, who blamed it on the government,  
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,  
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent,  
But the fact of it is nobody gives any more.  
Back in nineteen hundred and thirty-nine  
There were scores of German military waiting in a line,  
And the Fatherland wanted what the world wouldn't give,  
And then Hitler decided he could take what was his,  
So they all went to war and said  
Kill all the left-wing intellectuals,  
Annihilate the Jews and wipe out their race,  
Eliminate the weak because they're ineffectual,  
And the fact of it is nobody gives any more.  
I'm only sitting here watching it all go on  
And listening to both sides.  
Yeah, why can't we talk it out,  
Why can't we sort it out,  
We'll work it out if we try.  
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,  
Why not negotiate and try to be civilised?  
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.  
Nobody listens and no one will understand.  
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,  
And listening to both sides.  
Why can't we work it out?  
Why can't we sort it out?  
We'll work it out if we try.  
Why can't we sit down and work out a compromise,  
Why not negotiate and try to be civilized?  
I'll tell you why, because nobody gives a damn.  
Nobody listens and no one will understand.  
Yet, I'm wondering, sitting here wondering,  
Yet I'm wondering, sitting here wondering  
Listening to both sides.  
Nobody gives, nobody gives, nobody gives.  
The workers told the unions who blamed it on the government,  
The politicians blamed it on the strikers and the militants,  
Everybody's guilty and everybody's innocent.  
Nobody gives. Nobody gives a damn any more.  
The politicians, unions, workers and the militants,  
The fact of it is nobody gives any more.

Scene: flash is on the run and he goes to belle for help.  
He sings this song with belle.  
  
Flash: when we were young and green  
We shared our dreams together,  
And you were my friend.  
  
Belle: we had our good times pal,  
We thought they'd last forever.  
But nothing lasts forever,  
Nothing lasts forever.  
Time goes by and people change  
It's best we go our separate ways  
And it was wrong to think our love would never end  
My friend  
Nothing lasts forever,  
Nothing lasts forever.  
Time goes by it takes us all,  
Nations crumble and empires fall  
And who are we  
To think that we would always be,  
You see nothing lasts forever,  
Nothing lasts forever.  
  
Flash: I know that you'll survive  
And you'll get by whatever.  
Though you say goodbye.  
My love will never die,  
It will last forever.  
  
Your love will die but mine will last forever,  
Your love will fade but mine will last forever.  
Your feeling might go but mine will last forever.  
And though you're gone you're in my mind forever.

Remember walking with you by my side  
You were my papa and I was your pride  
Now I've got children and I'm going grey  
No time for talking I got nothin' to say  
Those Sunday dinners that we had at home  
Now I've got a house and I've got friends of my own  
We can't do tomorrow what we did yesterday  
It's best that we're going our separate ways, ok  
How is your rheumatism (nothing to say)  
How are your chillblains (nothing to say)  
How's Aunty Mabel (nothing to say)  
So far papa, I got nothin' to say, ok  
Those happy days we spent together  
We thought our world would never change  
How the days go by  
And things will never be the same  
You keep pretending that everything's fine  
So you make small talk to help pass the time  
But all the words that you spit from your face  
Add up to nothin' you got nothin' to say  
How are those noisy neighbors next door  
I'll have to go soon ''cause I'm getting bored  
I gotta be home early to see a good play  
So far papa, I got nothin' to say  
How is your life insurance (nothing to say)  
How is your trade union (nothing to say)  
How is your independence (nothing to say)  
So for papa, I got nothin' to say

In the beginning of it all there was the land  
And the sea and she sky  
Then into the middle of it all there came man  
To live on the land.  
  
And then a great nation  
Put into operation an evolutionary plan  
Now mighty corporations and politicians rule the land  
Wish I could remember when  
  
We were more innocent  
Than all of those violent bitter men.  
The world was much younger then  
But we were much wiser then.  
  
Before we were full of discontent.  
It's too bad the simple ways came sadly to an end  
I guess that's the difference between now and then.  
In the beginning of it all there was the land.  
  
We were much younger then  
But we were much wiser then  
We never questioned why or when  
One day we'll be born again  
  
Our lovers and friends will remain  
To live in a world without suffering and pain  
And I can see a day when enemies are friends.  
And there'll be no distance between now and then.  
In the beginning of it all there was the Land.

In a world full of jive  
Full of homicide and suicide  
There's no room for love and romance  
In a world full of spite  
Full of hatefulness and bitterness  
Sincerity don't stand a chance  
And every night I close my eyes  
And ask the stars above  
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?  
  
Where is love and romance  
And appreciation of storybooks, fairy tales  
And the ordinary things people did long ago  
Where did it go?  
Where is love?  
Where is hope?  
Where is sympathy and trust?  
Where is faith?  
Where is joy in simplicity?  
And where is regard and respect?  
Oh where, oh where is love?  
This world is spinning and turning  
And my head is full of learning  
But my thoughts keep on returning  
To the things I used to know  
I should be stronger  
But my mind continually wanders  
And deep inside  
A voice keeps crying  
Where, oh where is love?  
  
Where is love and romance  
And appreciation of storybooks, fairy tales,  
And the ordinary things people did long ago?  
Where did it go?  
In a world full of jive  
Full of homicide and suicide  
There's no room for love and romance  
In a world full of rape  
Full of hatefulness and bitterness  
Sincerity don't stand a chance  
And every night I close my eyes  
And ask the stars above  
Oh where, oh where, oh where, oh where is love?  
Where oh where is love?  
Where is love?  
Where is hope?  
Where is sympathy and trust?  
Where is faith?  
Where is joy and simplicity  
And where is regard and respect?  
Oh where, oh where is love?  
Oh where oh where is love?  
Oh where oh where is love?

All life we work but work is bore,  
If life's for livin' what's livin' for,  
She lives in a house that's near decay,  
Built for the industrial revolution,  
  
But in her dreams she is far away,  
In Oklahoma U.S.A.  
With Shirley Jones and Gordon McRea,  
As she buys her paper at the corner shop,  
  
She's walkin' on the surrey with the fringe on top,  
'Cause in her dreams she is far away,  
In Oklahoma U.S.A.,  
She walks to work but she's still in a daze,  
  
She's Rita Hayworth or Doris Day,  
And Errol Flynn's gonna take her away,  
To Oklahoma U.S.A.,  
All life we work but work is a bore,  
If life's for livin' then what's livin' for.

See Johnny Thunder sitting on his motorbike  
Riding along the highway,  
Rock and roll songs from the nineteen-fifties  
Buzzing around in his brain.  
Johnny Thunder he's one of the original bebop generation  
And he's got no time for complicated music  
Or too much sophistication.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The motorbike riders.  
You ought to see Johnny Thunder  
Riding down the highway  
One of the rock and roll survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain.  
He digs Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
And Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He plays Hound Dog, Oh Boy,  
And Great Balls of Fire  
And Boppin' At The High School Hop.  
And he's got no time for phonies or posers  
Cause they don't know how to reel and rock.  
And he plays Little Egypt and Ooh Poo Pah Doo,  
And he plays Poison Ivy and Blue Suede Shoes,  
The Hollywood Argyles, Danny and The Juniors,  
Dion and The Belmonts, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
He's one of the survivors,  
The boppers and the jivers,  
Yeah and he rocks all day.  
Johnny and The Hurricanes, Johnny and The Hurricanes.  
  
Got my freedom riding along the freeway.  
I ride a hundred miles an hour  
But I don't mess up my D.A.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
Rock, rock, rock, rock, rock 'n' roll.  
You can't stop rock 'n' rollin' music play.  
  
Feel those vibrations flow in my brain.  
Got my freedom riding down the highway,  
Keeps me sane, feel alive,  
I'm one of the survivors.  
  
Feel all right.  
First gear, second gear,  
Third gear, fourth gear, all right.  
Old Johnny Thunder looks a little overweight,  
And his sideburns are turning grey.  
But he still likes to bebop, boogie and jive  
To his worn out seventy-eights.  
Johnny Thunder.  
He's alright.  
He's one of the survivors,  
Twelve bars flowing through his brain,  
Jerry Lee Lewis, Dion and The Belmonts,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes,  
Johnny and The Hurricanes.

Standing by the elevator  
Feeling gloomy and down  
Waiting for the flashing light  
To lift me up from the ground  
  
Then the elevator opened  
And I saw her standing there  
She had to be a young executive  
She looked so corporate and clean  
  
And I thought I'd seen her somewhere before  
On the cover of a magazine  
I didn't think she'd even look at me  
Or bother to glance my way  
  
But she actually smiled at me and said  
Hi-ya handsome, have a good day  
  
[Chorus]  
I must be dreaming if she looks at me  
I gotta be dreaming, is it a fantasy  
Now I've got positive emotions  
Buzzing 'round every molecule in me  
I gotta be dreaming, is it reality  
But over and over I live that memory  
Was it real or only a dream  
La la la la  
  
Was it my imagination playing tricks on me  
When she looked my way  
Maybe she took me for somebody else  
Whatever it was, it made my day, hey hey  
  
I wake up in the morning  
Smiling with anticipation  
Suddenly I feel alive  
Face the world with expectation  
  
I must be dreaming this world is a better place  
Was my imagination playing tricks on me  
Was it real or only a dream?  
I see a great big sunset  
  
Where only clouds used to be  
Was it all an illusion, is it fantasy  
If it's just a dream  
It's good enough for me, yeah yeah  
  
Waiting by the elevator  
Feeling optimistic and keen  
Waiting for my executive goddess  
To appear as if in a dream  
  
Then the elevator opened  
She was talking to another guy  
And I tried to say hello to her  
But I failed to even catch her eye  
  
Then everybody crowded inside  
And I sadly stood my ground  
Thinking life's just like that elevator  
It takes you up and brings you down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Was it only an illusion  
Was it real or only a dream  
  
[Chorus]
