Them dead presidents  
Them dead presidents  
Well I ain't broke but I'm badly bent  
Everybody loves them dead presidents  
A little bit of Lincoln can't park the car  
Washington he can't go too far  
Jefferson is good, played the track  
If you think you're gonna bring some big bitch back  
  
Them dead presidents  
Hamilton on a ten can get you straight  
But Jackson on a twenty is really great  
And if you're talkin' about a poor man's friend  
Grant will get you out of whatever you're in  
Them dead presidents  
  
A hundred dollar Franklin is really sweet  
A five hundred McKinley is the one for me  
If I get a Cleveland I'm really set  
A thousand dollar Cleveland is hard to get  
Them dead presidents

I've got the key to the highway,  
Billed out and bound to go.  
I'm gonna leave here running,  
Because, walkin is most too slow.  
  
I'm goin back to the border,  
Where I'm better known.  
Because, you haven't done nothin,  
But, drove a good man away from home.  
  
Give me one more kiss, mama,  
Just before I go.  
I'm gonna leave this town,  
Girl, I won't be back no more.  
  
When the moon peep over the mountain,  
Honey, I'll be on my way.  
I'm gonna roam this highway,  
Until the break of day.  
  
Well, it's so long, so long baby,  
I'm gonna say goodbye.  
I'm gonna roam this highway,  
Until the day I die.

And his overcoat too

Smellin' like a whiskey can

Who's that while ago?  
Yes, when I came in  
Who went out that back door?
