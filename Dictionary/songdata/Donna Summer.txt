If you're ready to fall in love  
Here's the thing you've been dreaming of  
Scientific fact that you should know  
  
If you're ready to give your heart  
And you don't know which way to start  
And you're afraid you'll go against the flow  
  
Ask anyone who's ever been given the blow  
If you'll know when all systems are go  
  
[Chorus]  
All systems go, ohoohooh  
All systems go, oohoohooh  
All systems go, all systems go  
All systems go oo oh oo oh  
All systems go, all systems go  
All systems go oo oh oo oh  
  
Is your mind in computer mode?  
And all your senses in overload  
And all controls for take off in your hands  
  
200,000 watts of my love are starting  
To glow  
Let you know that all systems are go  
  
You're on a one way trip to the sun  
Your heart's on fire and you're ready to run  
Faster now faster, we're headin' out for  
Planet Mars  
Love sudden impact, everything's under  
Control  
And all systems are go  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
Whats the point of crying  
Angel of Joy  
Angel of Joy  
Angel of life.  
  
Tears will hold holy water  
Crying for us all  
Every son and every daughter  
Rise up before we fall  
  
Dark boy dark boy  
The grace of god be with you  
Waiting for all the mercy  
To surround us all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open the doors, heavens  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
  
Oh  
  
Let me do it again  
  
One boys lack of choir  
Singing sacred words  
Brake the wall of his sisters  
Till it bans the universe  
  
Dark boy dark boy  
The grace of god be with you  
Waiting for all the mercy  
To surround us all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Open the doors, heavens  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
  
Oh  
  
Let me do it again  
  
Its a broken heart  
Of the wounded child  
Covered with scabs  
Growing out of love  
What will it take  
Open your heart  
Before his last breath  
Before he departs  
  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
  
Oh  
  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign  
Bring down the reign

Can't understand  
Why this whole world  
Is pulling me down to the ground  
I walked two steps  
They called me bad feet  
Oh when will this world ever let me be  
Can't understand  
Why this whole world  
Is taking so long  
It's making me strong  
Somebody said  
Well just turn your cheek  
What you've got to know  
That it's making me weak  
Can't understand  
Why this whole world  
Is pulling me down to the ground  
Unchain my head  
Please unchain my feet  
And please let me walk  
With these steady feet  
With these steady feet  
With these steady feet  
Oh please let me walk  
And let me be free  
Oh yeah

Cold and lonely night, you don't have to leave at all  
A car rolls up outside on time, a moment from your call  
And handshake seems more fitting than a kiss  
Such a shame that you and I should have to end like this  
  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Surely you can ask the better way  
Strange that you're the one so set on leaving  
And I'm the one who said last night that it was all too late  
  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Who knows, maybe in a little while  
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night  
And maybe you and I can talk it out  
  
Tonight stay somewhere warm, they say it's gonna freeze  
You may not find a place at all, so be sure and take your keys  
I can almost taste the silence now  
Does it really matter still,  
Who was wrong, who let who down  
  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Who knows, maybe in a little while  
We'll forget our pride, and the things we said last night  
And maybe you and I can talk it out  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Surely you and I can talk it out  
Hold on, hold on  
Surely you and I can make it right  
Hold on, hold on, yeah  
Can't we just sit down and talk it over  
Hold on, hold on  
Hold on, hold on

La, la, la, la, la, la  
  
Carry on  
Carry on my love  
Just don't look back again  
Follow the dream that's in you  
Say so long  
Say so long my love  
Just get it right this time  
You know it's all up to you  
You've wandered down this road so long  
But faith keeps telling you to go on, go on  
  
Carry on, carry on  
Carry on, carry on  
  
Carry on  
Carry on my love  
Just don't look back again  
Look for the strength that's in you  
Say so long  
Say so long my love  
Trust in your heart again  
You know it's all up to you  
You've wandered down that road so long  
But faith keeps telling you to go on, go on  
  
Carry on, carry on  
Carry on, carry on  
  
Carry on  
Carry on my love  
Just don't look back again  
Look for the strength that's in you  
Say so long  
Say so long my love  
  
Baby, baby don't be afraid  
Baby you can make it baby  
Baby, baby, baby, baby carry on  
You can make it  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
Baby, baby, baby carry on

It's a windy night  
Of first and main  
Of any city  
Of a hundred names  
Spirits fly high and the sparks fly low  
  
And the cats are all creeping out the back door slow  
And the cats are out, gonna harmonize  
They're headed for cool street on the main line  
And here comes that joe serpentine  
The life of a cat can leave you far behind  
  
They're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
  
It's hard to be yourself  
When everyone else is around  
There's always someone out there  
Trying to pull you down  
  
You're sitting on the fence crying out to the moon  
The day goes by too fast and the night comes too soon  
You bet your life and you sell your soul  
Give it all up for beggar's gold  
And the hidden city has its own laws  
Produces a species cats without claws  
  
They're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
  
Oh, here they come again  
Singing songs in a melody  
Do, do, do, do, do  
  
Oh, oh, it's tough life, tough life, tough life  
And the streets are full of pain  
Specially when it's calling out your name  
It's hard on the one who doesn't sacrifice  
The things the world has to offer nice  
Come inside, spend some time, stay alive  
It'll take your heart and it'll steal your mind  
  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh, they're just cats without claws  
Never had a good reason  
Never had a cause  
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Christmas is here  
Snowflakes filling the air  
People rushing past every display  
  
No time for napping  
There's buying and then wrapping  
The gifts to be given away

I'm walking the line  
I'm walking the line  
Treading thin ice  
Time after time  
  
I go for the best, end up with much less  
I need the real thing  
Forget all the rest  
  
Started out good  
Working out bad  
All the sweet love turner  
Sour and sad  
  
A face and name  
It's always the same  
So tired of playing love's foolish games  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by  
  
[Chorus]  
Cold love, cold love  
Another shot of rock 'n' roll love  
Cold love, cold love  
Whatever happened to that  
Good old love  
Tell me why, tell me why, tell me why  
Tell me why, tell me why  
  
Hope in the dark, love in the light  
I'll keep on looking for someone  
Who's right  
  
I'm out for the best  
Can you stand the test  
I need the real thing  
No more and no less  
Tell me why  
Love passes me by  
  
[Chorus]

Oh baby it's been so long  
I've waited so long  
And now that I have you  
I want you to come, come, come  
  
Spirits move me every time I'm near you  
Whirling like a cyclone in my mind  
Oh sweet Peter, angel of my lifetime  
Answer to all answers I can find  
  
Baby, I want you, come, come, come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you  
Baby, I want you no, no, no, and hold on fast  
Could this be your magic at last?  
  
Baby, take me high upon a hillside  
High up where the stallion meets the sun  
I could love you, build my world around you  
Never leave you till my life is done  
  
Baby, I want you, come, come, come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you  
Baby, I want you no, no, no, hold on fast  
Could it be your magic at last?  
  
Baby I want you, come  
Now come and hold on fast  
Could this be your magic at last  
Could it be magic?  
  
Come, come, come into my arms  
Could this be your magic at last?  
Could it be magic?  
  
Come, come, come into my arms  
Let me know the wonder of all of you, all of you  
Baby I want you, now, now, oh now  
Oh come and hold on fast

Hey hey oh  
Donna, what's going on?  
  
1 2 3  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're like crayons melting in the sunshine  
Take a big eraser and wipe out the line  
Oh ,oh what's up tell me what's a-happening  
say you want love but why ain't you sacrificing?  
we're like crayons melting in the sunshine  
I'll color your world if you color mine  
Oh ,oh what's up tell me what's a-happening  
say you want love but why ain't you sacrificing?  
  
Come on over you sleepyhead  
it's time to color my dress in red  
It don't matter if it's day or night  
we play in color not in black in white  
  
Come on let's color the world in green  
Let's make a difference in the way we dream  
We're going to color a smiling face  
on the people of the human race  
  
1 2 3  
  
I'll take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you can be mine  
In and out, in and out, in and out of the lines  
Take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you could be mine  
In and out of the lines, in and out , in and out of the lines  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Everybody dreaming )  
  
If we mix in some pink and blue  
We get a beating at a purple hue  
Mellow yellow when the day is done  
Becomes the orange of the setting sun  
  
1 2 3 come on  
  
I'll take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you can be mine  
In and out, in and out, in and out of the lines  
Take a walk on the wild side  
Don't be afraid you could be mine  
In and out of the lines, in and out , in and out of the lines  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Red is the color of the blood in our veins oh  
Like the rainbow we are one the same (just one yeah)  
(Everybody dreaming )  
Yellow is the color of the sun we share  
The green grass is everywhere  
(Everybody dreaming )  
  
Chorus

I stand before you with my mind open wide  
waiting to receive whatever will be  
the world the eyes survey is not the only world  
for deep within the soul can be found all things  
  
Like the shape of sound, the shape of wind  
like the shape of things when they first begin  
how could I stop what I had to start  
the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
All I want is to love you  
all I need is to get through  
what I believe is a light in the dark  
the crying of a waking heart  
  
You shine inside me like the moon in the stream  
and the waters flow around me  
  
Like the colour of sun I cannot explain  
behind the familiar the view is strange  
maybe to love is to fly apart  
and this emotion the cry of a waking heart  
  
(Chorus):  
(Bridge):  
Golden slumber  
now and forever  
truly rising  
imagine heaven  
one vibration  
this eternal thing  
  
(Chorus x2, out)

Dance into my life, only for a while  
Whirl me round and round  
Dance me like an angel child  
He's passing through my world  
He doesn't even know  
Time's not on my side  
No word or goodbye, I'll go  
  
So dance on, right now I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home  
(i'll be going home)  
Just dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes, in my eyes  
  
Dance into my life  
Hold the moment fast  
Make believe in us  
Nothing real in life can last dance within my life  
Dance me to the door  
I can't see the time, but the time has come for sure  
  
So dance on, right now I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home  
(i'll be going home)  
Just dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
I can't let him notice the tears in my eyes  
In my eyes, in my eyes  
  
Dance with me, dance with me  
Won't you dance with me  
Dance with me, dance with me  
Won't you dance with me  
  
So dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home  
(i'll be going home)  
So dance on, right now  
I want to dance on  
Until the moment's over  
And I'll be going home

I want to have dinner with Gershwin  
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch  
I want to talk theory with Curie  
Impossible I guess  
  
I want to talk moods with Picasso  
On a rendezvous  
I want to fly double with Earhart  
I want to get next to you  
Next to you  
  
So close  
Just as close as I can get  
The rain of your worry  
Can't effect  
What I feel is what I feel  
One touch  
Of your greatness  
Is what I need  
My circle of fantasy  
Would be complete  
  
I want to sing hymns with Mahalia  
When the day is through  
I want to tell you about it  
I want to get next to you  
Next to you  
  
So close  
Just as close as I can get  
The rain of your worry  
Can't effect  
What I feel is what I feel  
One touch  
Of your greatness  
Is what I need  
My circle of fantasy  
Would be complete  
  
So close  
Just as close as I can get  
The rain of your worries  
Can't effect  
What I feel is what I feel  
One touch  
Of your greatness  
Is what I need  
My circle of fantasy  
Would be complete  
  
I want to have dinner with Gershwin  
I want to watch Rembrandt sketch  
I want to talk theory with Curie

Down deep inside  
There's a place in me I'm yearning to explore  
Look in my eyes  
And remember wine, the music and amour  
The days grow stronger and longer  
With every glance  
It's what a stare and the dance were  
To find romance  
While dancers dance so close  
  
Deep inside to our dream of dreams  
Our theme of themes  
Romance  
  
Yes I'm falling watch me falling  
Something warm is turning inside of me  
Something warm is burning inside of me

It's raining, it's pouring  
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years  
  
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance  
We don't stand a chance  
  
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover  
But he turned out to be like every other man I loved  
  
Raining (raining)  
Pouring (pouring)  
There's nothing left for us here  
And we won't waste another tear  
  
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it  
  
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it  
  
Tell him to just get out,  
  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
Pack his raincoat show him out  
  
Just look him in the eye and simply shout:  
Enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
If you've reached the end,  
Don't pretend that is right when it's over  
  
(It's over)  
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over  
  
(Over, over)  
  
Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,  
But he turns out to be like every other man I loved  
Our love (I had no choice from the start)  
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)  
Our love (tearing us apart)  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
No more tears (no more tears)  
No more tears (no more tears)  
No more tears (no more tears)  
No more tears (no more tears)  
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
I've had it, you've had it, he's had it, we've had is  
  
I always dreamed I find the perfect lover,  
  
But he turned out to be like every other man I loved  
  
I had no choice from the start  
I've gotta listen to my heart  
Tearing us apart  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister  
Goodbye sugar  
  
It's raining, it's pouring  
There's nothing left for us here  
And we won't waste another tear  
  
No more tears  
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
Is enough!

Right outside the window something's happening  
A man he stares into a TV screen  
From the next apartment we hear music  
Bleeding through the scene  
  
TV pans the bedroom, woman's sleeping  
Hands are sprawled out loosely across the bed  
She must be pretty rich  
'Cause I can see all the diamonds on her neck  
  
[Chorus]  
And there's always someone watching  
Eyes  
TV's and someone's watching  
Eyes  
In the kitchen someone's watching  
Eyes  
And the maid and butler's watching  
Eyes  
  
Silent sunbeams falling across the window  
Suddenly she awakens with surprise  
Day and night they always go so quickly  
In TV time...  
  
Her husband rushes in and in the meantime  
She just slightly smiles and turns her head  
He just whispers something to her softly  
God knows what he said...  
  
You know it wasn't very long  
Before the two of them were kissing  
She was his wife, he was her man  
But they knew what they were missing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
TV's on and someone's watching  
Eyes  
They're getting in through your eyes  
Don't let them poison your mind...

Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
You took my heart for a ride  
You tried to hurt cheat and lie  
But you'd better know  
That this walk down the road  
You're gonna face the music and dance oh  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
I gave you all I could give  
I tried to teach you how to live  
Baby but this time  
Please write down the line  
You're gonna face the music and dance oh  
You took good chance with my love  
You tread it down and beat it all  
But you'd better know  
This walk down the road  
You're gonna face the music and dance oh  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
Listen to me baby  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance  
Somewhere in the dark  
Corners of your heart  
You will know I'm gone  
Distant like a dream  
Just a memory  
Fading with the dawn  
Somewhere in the dark  
Corners of your heart  
You will feel I'm gone  
I'm gone  
Face the music  
Face the music  
Face the music and dance

On a fairy tale high  
Don't you believe that your dreams all come true  
The fairy tale world inside can bring it to you  
You just have to wish, and you'll take off and fly  
  
On a fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
  
On a fairy tale high  
Just look around you, the dark clouds are far  
Stand on your tiptoes, and reach for a star  
As stardust comes sprinkling, it will brighten your eyes  
  
On a fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
  
Fairy tale high, fairy tale high, fairy tale high  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher  
On a fairy tale high, feeling higher and higher

No escaping  
No spell is over me  
Fantasy's fact you see in my life  
Time and motion  
Seem to have made a stop  
And if the whole world passes by  
I wouldn't bat an eye  
If you say you were mine  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
Such devotion  
I've never felt before  
You opened up a door in my life  
No tomorrow  
Could there be without you  
And if you should say goodbye  
I think that I would die  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
I can't think about anything else  
But you  
There's nothing I can do  
Oh no, oh no  
Nothing I can do  
Nothing I can do  
I can't think about anything else  
But you  
There's nothing I can do  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
Fascination all I do is  
Fascination dream of you  
Fascination...  

Where am i going? what is the place?  
Somebody help me outta here.  
  
Oh i'm walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere  
Oh i'm running slower, slower and slower to somewhere  
'cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me  
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare  
No matter which way-mare  
  
Spoken:  
Seems that there must be some way to get out.  
But i just can't find it.  
  
People pushing, hustling, rushing on into the future  
Windows open, closing, in a way that they just never used to  
Oh there's violence lurking in the alleys  
Where no one should dare go  
So keep walking faster, faster and faster to nowhere  
  
I gotta get out, somebody...that guy came at me with a gun  
The city closing in  
  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
  
Children crying, screaming, but no one lets on that they hear them  
It's getting louder, louder, surely that someone must hear them  
'cause the city's closing tighter and tighter around me  
It's a nightmare, daymare, it's a badmare  
No matter which way-mare  
  
Help me, i want to get out.  
Cut it out! stop closing in on me help!!!  
  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little  
Trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere, trip to nowhere  
We're gonna take a little

Every day I give you a reason to cry  
I see the hurt in your eyes  
But stronger yet  
I see the love that shines  
  
Help me learn to take on the nature of you  
And love more than I accuse  
And pardon others like you taught me to  
  
'Cause something happens inside my heart  
Lord, when I obey  
Something happens inside my heart  
Every time I pray  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
The ones who broke my heart  
The way I've broken yours  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
And reach out through the pain  
And touch with hands of grace  
  
As you prayed for those who crucified you  
"Forgive, they don't know what they do"  
Compassion reched out to a world confused  
  
Help me learn to bless those who persecute me  
And pray for my enemies  
And show them mercy like you've shown to me  
  
'Cause something happens inside my heart  
Lord, when I obey  
Something happens inside my heart  
Every time I pray  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
The ones who broke my heart  
The way I've broken yours  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
And reach out through the pain  
And touch with hands of grace  
  
Forgive me  
As I learn how to forgive  
The ones who broke my heart  
The way I've broken yours  
Forgive me  
  
As I learn how to forgive  
And reach out through the pain  
And touch with hands of grace  
Forgive me

Romance me...dance me  
'til I don't care  
You haven't lived until you've danced on air  
Whisper nothings if you dare  
Won't you please, be my Fred Astaire  
  
(Jam):  
Everybody up...everybody up  
Everybody up on the dance floor now  
Everybody up...everybody up  
Everybody up on the dance floor now  
  
I know they call you Mr. Lonely Heart  
But you're the leading man to play the part  
You don't have to be a millionaire  
All you have to do is be my Fred Astaire  
  
(Chorus):  
Get up now...get up now  
Get up now...be my Fred Astaire (x2)  
  
(Jam):  
When you move it's like a melody  
Serenading...the very heart of me  
I'll be your Ginger Rogers on the floor  
Swirl me. twirl me 'til I just can't  
Take no more  
  
(Chorus):  
Boy if you could only read my mind  
You've been in my dreams a thousand time  
  
(Jam):  
(Chorus Jam):  
Everybody up  
(get up now)  
Everybody up  
(get up now)  
Everybody up  
(be my Fred Astaire).

I'm writing you this song  
'Cause I've always wanted to let you know  
That no matter where you go  
My love is with you  
Long after the curtain falls  
It's you I hear  
Breaking down the walls  
To let me know you're there  
So sincerely  
You've stood beside me  
All through the years  
Together we have grown  
My friends unknown  
Down on your knees you pray, for me  
Deep in my heart you'll stay  
Eternally  
You can turn my gray skies blue  
There's just no me without you  
For all the love you've shown  
My friends unknown  
This road may be long and winding  
But no matter where it takes me to  
I will always find my way  
Back to you  
And you should know that no matter  
where you go  
I'm always there for you  
I say a prayer for you  
And I love you  
Eternally  
And if we never, never ever meet again  
You'll always know where I stand  
I'll never be alone  
My friends unknown  
For all the love you've shown  
I wanna thank you  
My friends unknown.

From a distance, the world looks blue and green,  
And the snow capped mountains white.  
From a distance, the ocean meets the stream,  
And the eagle takes to flight.  
From a distance, there is harmony,  
And the echo through the land.  
It's the voice of hope,  
It's the voice of peace,  
It's the voice of every man.  
From a distance, we all have enough,  
And no one is in need.  
And there are no guns, no bombs and no diseases,  
No hungry mouths to feed.  
From a distance, we are instruments,  
Matching in a common band,  
Playing songs of hope,  
Playing songs of peace,  
There is the song of every man.  
God is watching us, God is watching us,  
God is watching us, from a distance,  
Ohh God is watching us....... From a distance.  
From a distance, you look like my friend, even though we're at war.  
From a distance, I just cannot comprehend, what all this fighting is for?  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it's the heart of every man.  
It's the hope of?, it's the love of all, it is the song of every man.  
Oh.. God is watching us, God is watching us..... From a distance

Full of emptiness  
Broken promises  
And love turned out so sad  
The hurt goes on and on  
  
Full of emptiness  
Hello loneliness  
Good friends will mind  
The sands of time  
Have slipped through my hands  
  
From the bottom to the top  
Why he had me feeling fine  
Then i took a long long drop  
When he walked out of my life  
My world  
  
Full of emptiness  
That and something less  
And memories of him  
Have never seemed to be

Happily ever after  
Look at me, right where i want to be  
My life took a turn, it's a happy affair  
I'm never alone even when he's not there  
Happily ever after, happily ever after  
  
Happily ever after  
So carefree, look what's come over me  
All my prayers have been answered, he heard my cry  
Took all my troubles and threw them aside  
Threw them aside  
Happily ever after, happily ever after  
  
Once in a lifetime!  
I never thought i could be  
So carefree, so carefree  
Happily ever after  
  
Happily ever after  
Him and me, sunshine and laughter  
We're never alone, when there's nobody there  
We're never alone, we got love to share  
Lots of love, happily ever after  
Lost of love, happily ever after  
We've got love, happily ever after  
  
Lots of love, happily ever after  
Just look at me, right where i want to be  
  
Happily ever after

Baby please, please don't take your love from me  
I am yours for ever more, 'till eternity  
Silently please, listen to the words I say  
I'm not talking just for play, listen to me please  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it' s not the way it could be  
Don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows I never want to leave you  
Heaven knows I only want to please you  
Don't you know love is what I need  
  
Down inside, don't get caught with foolish pride  
Blow the other things aside, its only you and me  
Believe in us, we were always meant to be  
Me for you and you for me, 'till eternity  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows I never want to leave you  
Heaven knows I only want to please you  
Don't you know love is what I need  
  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave  
Heaven knows it's not the way it should be  
And heaven knows it's not the way it could be  
And don't you know there's no need to leave

Watching raindrops, slowly falling  
Painting pictures on the window pane  
Feelings my heart cannot explain  
Oh the silence, sounds like music  
Seems like I can hear a melody  
Baby that's what you do to me  
  
(chorus):  
One thing I'm sure of  
Whether it's wrong or it's right  
I only want to be with you, tonight  
And if you want me to  
Baby ask me to stay  
Heaven's just a whisper away  
  
Feel the magic, taking over  
Please don't stop before we lose control  
Baby just let your feeling go  
Soft and tender, like the morning  
We get closer than we've ever been  
We're almost to the rainbow's end  
  
(chorus):  
I heard the winds of forever  
Calling out my name  
It's paradise, when I'm with you  
I will never be the same  
  
Please don't wake me if I'm dreaming  
'cause this time, this one is coming true  
So glad to share my dreams with you  
  
(chorus

Sittin' here eatin' my heart out waitin'

I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
I still remember how it used to be  
Seclusion in our love so deep  
A world to touch that meant so much to me  
And promises we couldn't hope to keep  
  
The cool romance and nights of ecstasy  
Slip slowly by on paper wings  
The cold reality of you and me  
Came creeping like a storm cloud gathering  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
The balance of our love hangs tenderly  
A careful step through broken glass, yeah  
One thoughtless word could kill a memory  
And days we loved together in the past  
  
I give and take i do my very best  
To keep this vision that i've seen  
I give respect if you could just accept  
There never really was a perfect me  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'll stand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
  
You walk away and see yourself in retrospect  
Remember all of love's first visions  
Step aside try to see just what went wrong  
Living together isn't easy all the time  
  
I believe in you if you believe in me, oh  
There's still the chance that we can find romance, yeah  
I know we can  
  
I believe in you  
If you believe in me  
And i believe that faith and hope and love brings harmony  
United once again  
We'llstand there hand in hand  
And put love back together just the way we've always planned  
I believe in you, if you believe in me  
I believe in you, i believe in you...  
United undivided...

Ran into mother Mary down on line  
Street in L.A.  
She was preaching the gospel  
She was singing how Jesus saves  
When a crowd of passing tourists  
Looked to see what they could see  
You know before they know it she had  
Them all down on their knees  
I believe in Jesus you know I know him  
Oh so well  
And I'm going to heaven by and by  
'cause I already been through hell  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus, in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus  
So onward Christian soldiers still  
Marching as to war  
With the cross of Jesus just going on before  
Now Jesus was a little lamb, his fleece  
Was white as snow  
And every where that Jesus went  
This lamb is sure to go  
Well I believe in Jesus you know I know him  
Oh so well  
And I'm going to heaven by and by  
'cause I saved my soul from going to hell  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus, in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus  
Look at the sheep 'cause they're  
Running fast  
They wanna make it through the gates  
At last  
So onward Christian soldiers still  
Marching as to war  
With the cross of Jesus just going on before  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus  
I believe in Jesus, in Jesus.....  

You and me we're together, loving  
Eyes can always stray  
Loving hearts will always find  
The way  
Don't pass through my life like a  
Season  
Don't hurry by like a highway sign  
Hear with your heart while I tell you  
What's on my mind  
  
Do believe I fell in love  
Do believe I fell in love  
Ooh yeah

Oh Charlie B don't you run away  
Forget your pride I'll tell you that  
I'm going to stay  
'cause love knows no pain, knows  
No worry  
Love is the same for all times  
Hear with your heart while I tell you  
What's on my mind  
  
Do believe I fell in love  
Do believe I fell in love  
Ooh yeah  
  
Ooh let me love you  
Ooh let me kiss you  
Baby I'm fallin', your love is a callin'  
The night is wasting away  
It used to be you, and I knew at  
The dawning  
Our love would last more than a day  
And every single little word is true  
I still love you  
  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love

I'm going to love you like nobody's  
Loved you  
Come rain or shine  
I'm going to need you like nobody's  
Needed you before  
  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love  
Do believe it  
Do believe that I'm fallin' in love

I don't need all my friends to tell me  
Things that I already know  
Like in the best of all worlds  
You shouldn't forget self-control  
  
Don't say I don't know what I'm doing  
'Cause he said "it's more than a feeling"  
And I said "I need you too"  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a change I've got to take  
  
I don't need all my friends to remind me  
Mistakes that I've already made  
I just leave the past behind me  
And go on believing that I'll be okay  
  
Some thing are only human  
And he said he'd always need me  
And I said "I want you too"  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
Just another heartache  
I don't need all my friends to tell me  
Things that I already know  
Like in the best of all worlds  
You shouldn't forget self-control  
  
Don't say I don't know what I'm doing  
And he said "it's more than a feeling"  
And I said "I need you too"  
Am I just a fool?  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt  
But I know it's a chance I've got to take  
  
I don't want to get hurt  
I don't want to get hurt  
I'm not looking for just another heartache  
I don't want to get hurt

From my once upon a time album  
A song about two people who fell in love  
Showing up one day face to face  
  
Well he searched and searched for nights and days  
Till he found the one he loved  
And he wrapped her in his arms again  
And then he thanked the stars above  
That he found what he'd been looking for  
And he stared her in the eyes  
  
He said "I love you"  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
She stared him right back in the eyes  
With a look of disbelief  
Then she gazed off into somewhere else  
Was it real or just a dream?  
And she pulled him oh so close to her  
And she whispered in his ear  
  
She said "I love you"  
Yes, I really do  
  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
Love you, love you, love you, love you  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
  
They said "I love you"  
Yes, they really do  
They said "I love you"  
Yes, they do  
  
Yes I do, yes I do, yes I do  
  
So together they will always be  
Until the stars fall from the sky  
So if you find someone you love a lot  
You must never let them go  
You just hold them tight with all your might  
And you say three little words  
  
You say "I love you"  
Yes, I really do  
You say "I love you"  
Yes I do  
You say "I love you"

(Con Te Partiro)  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
Your love was a light  
In the darkness that shone  
So profoundly  
Say that you'll stay  
Do not be afraid, afraid  
You, you're my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper  
  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
  
Stranded alone on a sea of emotion  
You found me  
It's you who first found me  
Come here, come here  
Put your arms around me,  
Come here  
It's you who surrounds me  
Come here, come here  
Come here  
Come here  
You, you're my breath  
The air I breathe  
You are my imagination  
Su le finesse  
Song of my heart  
Secrets I'm not afraid to whisper  
  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me  
Wherever you are  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
(forever and ever we'll stay)  
In love together  
  
Con te partiro  
I'll go where you lead me,  
Wherever you are  
I will go with you  
I'll go where you lead me  
Forever true  
In my...  
Heart!

If there is music there  
I'll have to go  
Never been anything in my life that I wanted more  
This is my greatest fear  
That I'm loosing you my dear  
It's more than I want to give  
But if there is music there  
  
If there is music there  
I'll have to know  
Never met anyone who could take music out of my soul  
There's something deep inside  
That I no longer want to hide  
My love you would never share  
If there is music there  
  
It's not my fault  
I've done no wrong  
It's something that you've always known  
I tried to tell you all along  
It seems that heaven has a plan  
An extraordinary plan  
A reason for my soul  
For my soul  
  
If there music there  
I'll have to go  
Never found anyone who could take music out of my soul  
This is my greatest fear  
That I'm loosing you my dear  
It's more than I want to give  
It's more than my heart can bear  
I could be losing you  
If there music there  
  
Spoken:  
I'm so sorry, honey  
I've always loved you  
I do love you  
But I just have to go

When you're walking alone  
Can't fight the crowd  
And you're pushing the world behind you  
Hold don't lose yourself in a crowded place  
Or I doubt it if I'll find you  
When you have found things were getting you down  
Don't try to run away  
Just wait for me  
And baby you'll see  
We'll make it through the day  
When you're walking alone  
Can't fight the heat  
And the people you meet aren't kind  
You just put your head out  
And take a step  
And there's no mountain we can't climb  
Oh when you have cried and the things on your mind  
Just seem to make you sad  
Forget everything  
Please come with me  
We'll laugh and we'll be glad  
When you have found things were getting you down  
Don't try to run away  
Just wait for me and baby you'll see  
We'll make it through the day  
Through the day  
When you're walking alone  
Can't fight the crowd  
And you're pushing the world behind you  
Hold don't lose yourself in a crowded place  
So I doubt it if I'll find you  
When you have cried and the things on your mind  
Just seem to make you sad  
Forget everything please come with me  
We'll laugh and we'll be glad  
Please come  
Please come  
Please come  
Yeah....

I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place that I love  
Even more than I usually do  
  
And although I know  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
And I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents under the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
And I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
If only in my dreams

Is there a remedy for the passions of the soul  
Brother if there is one I don't really know  
Have I let my imagination run out of control  
I'm a rainbow  
Just a rainbow  
  
Am I living here in this nameless state  
It's light on darkness sound of silence  
I just can't get it straight  
See I don't wanna be no one that I ain't  
I'm a rainbow  
Just a rainbow  
  
And all the colors that you see  
Are all part of me  
In this crazy world of mine  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow  
Ever changing all the time  
I'm a rainbow colorful rainbow  
Sometimes I shine  
  
And all the colors that you see  
Are all part of me  
In this crazy world of mine  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
Da, da, da ,da,da  
  
Like the wind that blows  
The trees are sailing for the breeze  
Ever changing all the time  
  
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow  
And sometimes I can shine  
I'm a rainbow just a rainbow

I was stranded in the dark  
Trying to find an open door, so alone  
Chains were wrapped around my heart  
Didn't know what love was for, no more  
Heard these voices in my head  
Telling me "you'll never escape"  
No you can't get away  
When the spirit in me said  
Your love could show me the way  
My whole life changed on that day  
Now I'm walking in the light all aglow  
All I see is sunshine in my eyes  
Skies of blue, it's true, I'm free  
  
[Chorus]  
Out from under shadows  
The only thing that matters  
Is that you've worked a miracle in me  
I'm free  
Now when clouds surround me  
They have no place around me  
All because your love has set me free  
I'm free  
  
From the time that I knew  
That I could find love in you  
My heart's been renewed  
Now all my dreams are coming true  
I was frightened in the cold  
Desperate when you found me in time  
You saved me from the world  
Got my life back in control  
Chased away the madness in my mind  
You saved me right in time  
Now the future's looking up  
Skies are blue, all because of you  
Got the sunshine in my life  
All aglow, baby, don't you know, I'm free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
From the time that I knew  
That I could find love in you  
My heart's been renewed  
Now all my dreams are coming true, I' m free  
  
[Chorus]

I can't lie  
I was attracted too  
Somehow the feelings  
Were so strong inside  
But I'm not free to be  
In love with you maybe  
Things would be different  
In another place and time  
  
And I can't give you  
All you want me to  
And I know you deserve  
The best from me  
But I can't give you more  
Of all that you long for  
I would have loved you  
In another place and time  
  
Dreams aren't always bound to come true  
But that's no reason you should cry  
  
'Cause I would have loved you  
Really loved you  
In another place and time  
  
I'm hurting deep inside  
Just want you to know  
Oh, I would have loved you  
Oh yeah, in another place and time  
  
Fate can't always be led by you  
The time ain't right for you and I  
  
In another place and time  
In another place and time

Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
If you're ever gonna kiss me  
It had better be tonight  
While the mandolins are playing  
And stars are bright  
If you've anything to tell me  
It had better be tonight  
Or somebody else may tell me  
And whisper the words just right  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"  
For this poor Americano  
Who knows little of your speech  
Be a nice Italiano  
And start to teach  
Show me how in old Milano  
Lovers hold each other tight  
But I want you sweet paesano  
It had better be tonight  
Meglio stasera  
Baby go go go  
Or as we natives say  
"Fa subito!"

We used to south of paradise  
That was okay until you put your heart on ice  
Walked out the door but you couldn't say goodbye  
Hide away and left me lonely  
When I asked you why  
You wouldn't be precise  
Now it's my turn, start taking my advice  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Running down long back alleys  
Pouting like a spoiled child  
You've been acting so crazy, driving me wild  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me that's just human nature  
I've done all I can, I can't seem to change you  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
  
Your love is like a nasty habit  
I finally got control but I just can't take it  
I tried to be cool but I just can't make it  
Your heart is like an elevator  
You tell me that it's just human nature  
I've done all I can, but just can't change you  
  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
  
Love is tough, love is tender  
Love will make your heart surrender  
Love is sweet, love is kind  
Love will always blow your mind  
  
It's not the way that you love me  
It's not the way that you care  
  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Oh no, it's not the way  
Listen mister to what I say.

Sitting by an open door  
With rain dropping in my face  
Then lightning strikes  
Across the room  
I fall in your embrace  
It was a lovely rendezvous  
Better than anyone ever know  
A gentle face a fiery heart  
With nothing to conceal  
That's what it takes to hold me down  
A man with grand appeal  
Oh while I draw you to my soul  
I feel the fire of love taking control  
Jeremy  
When I think of you  
The good times that we have  
The melody  
Sings out to me  
My heart at your command  
Jeremy  
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
Oohh...  
You're the only one who can  
Silent nights are lonely nights  
Wherever we're apart  
And every moment you're away  
I hide you in my heart  
Oh while I draw you to my soul  
I feel the fire of love taking control  
Jeremy  
When I think of you  
The good times that we have  
The melody  
Sings out to me  
My heart at your command  
Jeremy  
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
Oooh...  
You're the only one who can  
Jeremy you see  
That we are two of a kind  
We could stay together baby  
For all time  
We can live without each other  
But it wouldn't be the same  
'cause I am you and you are me  
It's never gonna change  
Jeremy  
When I think of you  
The good times that we have  
The melody  
Sings out to me  
My heart at your command  
Jeremy  
Oh baby, oh baby, oh baby  
Oooh...  
Jeremy  
Jeremy oh baby. oh baby..  

I thought that love was just a word  
Sung about in songs I heard  
Kisses could reveal that I was wrong  
And love was real  
Hold me close and hold me fast  
The magic spell you cast  
This is la vie en rose  
When you kiss me heaven sighs  
And though I close my eyes  
I see la vie en rose  
When you press me to your heart  
I'm in a world apart  
A world where roses bloom  
And when you speak, angels sing from above  
Everyday words seem to turn into love songs  
Give your heart and soul to me  
And life will always be  
La vie en rose

They call her the lady of the night  
She's a woman of the world  
And easy-living girl with love for sale  
  
That's what they call her the lady of the night  
No one seems to know her name  
And even less about the place  
From where she came  
  
Every evening when the night is close at hand  
You'll find the lady on the rue d'avignon  
In a half lit hotel doorway the lady advertises warmly  
It's just a job but she'll do the best she can  
  
Don't try to change this lady of the night  
She's a lot like you and me  
And less than what she seems to be  
  
(she is the lady of the night)  
And easy-living girl  
(she is the lady of the night)  
She's a woman of the world  
(she is the lady of the night)  
With lots of loving for sale  
(she is the lady of the night)  
Lady lady of the night  
  
Round here they call her the lady of the night  
In a perfume hotel room  
Shadows dance upon the wall and fate at dawn  
She's no beginner this lady of the night  
Never try that funny stuff  
'cause lady can be tough  
Be warned!  
  
(she is the lady of the night)  
She's a lot like you and me  
(she is the lady of the night)  
And never just what she seems  
(she is the lady of the night)  
No one seems to know her name  
(she is the lady of the night)  
Or the place from where she came

[Spoken:]  
After Jesus was born in Bethlehem in Judea  
During the time of king Herod  
Wise men from de east came to Jerusalem and asked  
"where is the one who is born king of the Jews?  
We saw his star in the east and we have come to worship him"  
  
Lord we have traveled far  
Torn and weary guided by your star  
There before us the living king  
Hallelujah his praises sing  
  
Herod with a evil plan  
Kill the babies  
Came his bold command  
He tried to alter god's holy plan  
God has saved him  
The son of man  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
Three kings from a distance come  
Bearing gifts for the only one  
Shout to heaven sound the drum  
Tell the nations  
The lord has come  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of love  
The chosen one of god  
  
He came to bring us his peace  
He came to bring us his joy  
To bring us love  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The precious lamb of god  
  
Behold the lamb of god  
The mighty king of god  
The chosen one of god  
  
[Spoken:]  
And so the wise men the shepherds  
The ox and the lamb  
The angels above  
All rejoiced at god's command  
As a star shine from heaven  
This new king to adorn  
On that very first christmas  
When Jesus Christ was born

Say you dominate you can never wait  
To listen to the things that I have got to say  
You're amorous, polygamous  
And that's okay as long as I don't start to play  
  
Say listen good  
You know you should  
Paradise is built inside an hour glass  
I'm feminine but that don't mean  
That I would want to travel second class  
  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm (yeah)  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my life  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm  
Just leave me alone  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine  
Leave me alone  
  
Now I am you and you are me  
The signs are right and it will fit eventually  
It's hard to take you'd better break  
A habit that has ruled for an eternity  
  
It's your concern you'd better learn  
I'll never belong to you or any other man  
Take what I give and go and live  
With someone else if you don't understand  
  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my life  
Leave me alone 'cause I've got my rhythm  
Just leave me alone  
Leave me alone  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine  
Leave me alone  
  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine for awhile  
Leave me alone if you want to stay mine for awhile  
  
Just leave me alone  
You think you're hot stuff  
You think you're so cool

Someone let communication out the door  
Someone decides it's worth fighting for  
Why haven't we learned by what we've done before  
Don't you know history's keeping score  
And just once more  
For every boy and every girl let there be love  
All over the world  
For everyone  
Under the sun  
(Chorus):  
Let there be peace on earth  
Let every voice be heard  
Le there be peace on earth  
Brother to brother  
'til it's felt around the world  
There's only one world in which we all mus live  
Heaven shoe us how to forgive  
And on that marble wall which holds a million names  
Generations of dreams gone down in flames  
Isn't, isn't it a shame  
For every boy and every girl  
Under the sun...  
(Chorus):  
Let there be peace on earth  
(why don't you try just a little harder)  
Let every voice be heard  
(my brother)  
Let there be peace on earth  
(oh, if we could just get it together)  
'til it's felt around the world...  
We're running out of time  
As our leaders roll the dice  
The human spirit cries  
Its a precious, precious, precious...sacrifice.  
(Chorus x2)  
Save the babies, save the babies  
If we only get it together  
If we could only get it together  
I think we could make it  
Think we could make it  
Save the children...  
Save the children...  

Different faces other races

There's a good there's a bad  
Some are gay, some are sad  
There's a right, there's a wrong  
Those who fit don't belong  
Well I'm the bad  
And I've got to admit  
That I'm sad  
I'm a little misfit  
I'm in the wrong  
And that's the truth of it  
I don't belong  
I'm a little misfit  
There's the sun there's the rain  
Those in love those in pain  
Some succeed while others fail  
Some will ease someone tells  
Well I'm in the rain  
And I've got to admit  
That I gonna pay  
I'm a little misfit  
Though I've failed  
That's the truth of it  
See me tell  
I'm a little misfit  
Life's so hard when you're far from everything  
Life's so cold when you know you have no friends  
Well I've lost  
And I've got to admit  
That I've paid the cost  
I'm a little misfit  
I still grow  
And that's the truth of it  
I'll always fall  
I'm a little misfit  
Well I'm bad  
And I've got to admit  
That I'm sad  
I'm a little misfit  
Well I'm bad  
And that's the truth of it  
That makes me sad  
I'm a little misfit  
Well I'm lost  
And I've got to admit  
That I've paid the cost  
I'm a little misfit  
I'm so poor  

Straight outta school but still just a fool  
Thought the streets were paved with gold  
He moved off the block and  
Found he was lost  
In a world he'd never known  
He had to hustle so he could pay the rent  
Played all the aces and wound up president

You're livin' in the home of the dream  
You're livin' in America

Soap opera child with hope in her eyes  
Lookin' for a starrin' role  
She came into town and acted the clown  
Had a long, long way to go  
Waitin' on tables and pumpin' gasoline  
She served and agent,  
Now she's a movie queen  
You see it's okay  
Got to find your own way

Looking up, again  
I'm coming back to life  
I'm coming back to life  
Looking up, to you  
If was really up to you  
You had to pull me through  
Looking up  
  
Looking up, a change is  
Coming over me  
I know now that I'm free  
Looking up, I find  
I'm walking tall and proud  
And happy all the time  
  
Looking up  
I'm looking up  
Looking up  
I see my troubles far behind  
Looking up  
(I'm looking up)  
Looking up  
I feel I'm rising to the top  
Looking up  
  
Looking up, a change is  
Coming over me  
I know now that I'm free  
Looking up, I find  
I'm walking tall and proud  
And happy all the time  
  
Looking up  
I'm looking up  
Looking up  
I see my troubles far behind  
Looking up  
(I'm looking up)  
Looking up  
I feel I'm rising to the top  
Looking up  
  
Someone that understands  
Is there until the end  
To hold the light for me  
The light that help me see  
And in my darkest hours  
Will come with sunny showers  
To help me to forget  
Oh I so glad we met  
And since that rainy day  
The clouds just stay away  
You chase them with your love  
The greatest love I've known  
'cause in the darkest hour  
You come with sunny showers  
My life is your today  
Don't ever go away  
  
Looking up  
I'm looking up  
I see my trouble far behind  
Looking up  
(I'm looking up)  
Looking up  
I feel I'm rising to the top...

Think about me and you  
Think of all the changes we've been through  
The laughter an' the tears  
The years together  
Little did we both know  
When we fell we gave up all control  
Though times get hard  
We're strong enough to carry on  
'Cause love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  
Stayed awake last night  
Told myself that this time we were through  
That passion wasn't pain  
My heart had changed  
But then in the morning light  
The feeling cut me like a knife  
And then I knew  
I couldn't walk away from you 'cause  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  
Oh, we can drive ourselves so far apart  
Till the world gets in between  
Before you know, the distance grows  
Till never we lose sight of the dream  
But the wonder of it all  
Is our love will survive  
It never fails to keep us going  
It never fails to keep us alive  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  
Love has a mind of its own  
It moves in it's own circles  
And it roams where it will roam  
Love has a mind of it's own  
It holds our lives together  
You're my heart and you're my home  

Hung around with big shots  
Never knew love was in the sights  
I guess, I missed the target  
Caught up in a different line of fire  
  
But I know since I've been aiming  
For the sweetness in your soul  
Your name is on the bullet  
And it's gettin' ready to explode  
  
There's been a change inside my life  
And I just wanna let you know  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
Mama used to tell me  
Girl, you better load your gun up right  
She said ya, ya gotta come out smokin'  
Hit it with your best shot every time  
  
Well I, I didn't understand her  
'Til you walked right into range  
I saw your love at twenty paces  
And I knew I'd won the game  
  
You better raise your heart up high  
Or love will blow you right away  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
Leave off that safety catch  
There ain't no risk we're gonna have some fun  
I've got cha, love's begun  
So stay with me until the mornin' sun  
  
You're super bullet number one  
  
There's been a change inside my life  
And I just wanna let you know  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go  
  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
Love is in control  
I've got my finger on the trigger  
I ain't lettin' go

Deep in the night, when you're  
Away from me  
I'm reachin' out just to touch you  
In my dreams  
Countin' the hours 'till you'll be  
Here again  
So hard to wait, got to have you  
Close to me  
'cause baby  
  
You, turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a  
Breath away  
  
Somethin' inside has taken  
Over me  
So baby, can't you see you  
Captured my heart  
I can't disguise the things you  
Make me feel  
I should have known this was  
Magic right from the start  
  
'Cause baby, you turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a breath away  
We, we don't have a word to say  
Our hearts can speak a thousand ways  
When love is just a breath away  
  
Take me, take me into paradise  
Show me  
All the love that's in your eyes  
Light up my life  
  
You, you turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a breath away  
We, we don't have a word to say  
Our heart can speak a thousand ways  
When love is just a breath away  
You, you turn my nights to day  
When your love, love is just a breath away

So many times in my life  
I've been alone, left alone  
Heart broken and  
Turned around  
I find myself  
Crying in the night time  
Dying out loud  
In the night I sleeplessly  
Wake up  
From a dream that's  
Tormenting me  
I, I, I, I, I gotta get help  
Oh, yeah  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Set me free  
Late at night I was afraid  
And I tried to turn away  
I was afraid to face  
What in-evil-it-able is  
Say you know the way  
To find true freedom  
Can you save yourself  
From the pain you're feeling  
Something in my head  
That you're dreaming  
That the angels said  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come heal me  
Love is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Set me free  
I am on a mission, a mission of love  
I am on a mission, a mission of love  
I am on a mission, a mission of love  
I am on a mission, a mission of love  
I am on a mission, a mission of love  
Love...is the healer  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free  
Love is the healer  
Come as a healer  
Set me free

I never needed someone  
''cause I always led a life of my own  
Never waited for the ring of the 'phone  
Never had anyone here  
When I got home  
But love's about to change my heart  
  
I'm waiting for the doorbell to chime  
When I always lived one day at a time  
I thought that I was getting on fine  
Never felt I was alone  
'til you change your mind  
Love's about to change my heart  
  
Could a day be so long  
When I always felt secure and so strong  
And all the time as I went along  
Never thought I would desire  
So much to belong  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change my heart, ooh  
  
Never ever thought the sky was so blue  
Never ever thought I'd feel so new  
Always thought I'd know what to do  
But I guess I wasn't counting on you  
  
What did I know  
I always felt so much on control  
I thought I'd make it all on my own  
Never thought I would forget  
All I have known  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change my heart  
Love's about to change, change, change  
My heart...

I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhymes  
I've acted out my life in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be  
I treated you unkindly but boy can't you see  
There's noone more important to me  
Baby can't you please see through me  
Cause we're alone now and I'm singing my song for all of you  
I love you in a place we're there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth withholding nothing  
You came out in front I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better and if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody  
Cause my love's in there hiding  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life cause you're friends of mine  
And when my life is over  
Remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singing my song for all of you  
Thank you people  
Thank you people oh yeah  
And you will help me every step of the way  
Yes you will  
And I will sing my song for all of you.....

Another Monday morning  
Another five day week ahead  
Such a lonely weekend  
Sleeping in a half filled bed  
  
Got those need-a-man blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those need-a-man blues  
And it's driving me mad  
  
All the evening people  
Dressing up just to get undressed  
And me I'm stuck at home  
Losing more and gaining less  
  
Got those need-a-man blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those need-a-man blues  
And it's driving me mad  
  
Emptiness inside  
Empty as a glass in my hand  
Whisky friend of mine  
Help me make it easy without  
  
Got those need-a-man blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those need-a-man blues  
And it's driving me mad  
  
Baby baby baby  
Goes the singer on my hi-fi  
Honey honey honey  
My reply  
  
Got those need-a-man blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those need-a-man blues  
And it's driving me mad  
  
Emptiness inside  
Empty as a glass in my hand  
Whisky friend of mine  
Help me make it easy without  
  
Got those need-a-man blues  
I need a man so bad  
Got those need-a-man blues  
And it's driving me mad  
  
Another Monday morning  
Another five day week ahead  
Such a lonely weekend  
Sleeping in a half filled bed  
  
Got those need-a-man blues  
I need a man so bad

Debra waiting on the corner  
Flaring smile and daring style  
Big G cruising, neon flashing  
Lost and found tinsel town  
Daytime orphans join the circus  
Climb the rope and walk the wire  
To feel the night and music playing  
Feed the fire to feed the fire  
Nightlife, only living for the nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Couples coasting, singles searching  
Loners lost among the crowd  
Action turning on reaction  
Loosen up, fool around  
Pretzel vendor, first class spender  
Limousine and ketchup dream  
Pinball hall and Roulette roller  
Every scene for everything  
Nightlife, only living for the nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Nightlife, only living for the nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Nightlife  
Nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
Nightlife  
It's the only kind of nightlife  
I only come alive for nightlife  
It's the only another nightlife  
[Incomprehensible]  
Nightlife  

[Barbra Streisand]  
It's raining, it's pouring  
My lovelife is boring me to tears, after all these years  
  
[Donna Summer]  
No sunshine, no moonlight, no stardust, no sign of romance  
We don't stand a chance  
  
[Barbra]  
I've always dreamed I found the perfect lover  
But he turned out to be like every other man  
Our love, our love  
  
[Both]  
Raining (raining)  
Pouring (pouring)  
There's nothing left for us here  
And we won't waist another tear  
  
[Donna]  
If you've had enough, don't put up with his stuff, don't you do it  
  
[Barbra]  
If you've had your fill, get the check pay the bill, you can do it  
  
[Donna]  
Tell him to just get out,  
  
[Barbra]  
Nothing left to talk about  
  
[Donna]  
Pack his raincoat show him out  
  
[Both]  
Just look him in the eye and simply shout:  
Enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
[Donna]  
If you've reached the end, don't pretend that is right when it's over  
  
[Barbra]  
(It's over)  
If the feeling is gone don't think twice just move on, get it over  
  
[Donna]  
(Over, over)  
  
[Both]  
Tell him to just get out, say it clearly, spell it out:  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
[Barbra]  
I've always dreamed to find the perfect lover,  
But he turns out to be like every other man  
Our love (I had no choice from the start)  
Our love (I've gotta listen to my heart)  
Our love (Tearing us apart)  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Enough is enough  
Enough is enough  
That's enough  
  
[Both]  
No more tears (No more tears)  
No more tears (No more tears)  
No more tears (No more tears)  
No more tears (No more tears)  
Enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
I've had it, you've had it he's had it, we've had is  
  
[Donna]  
I always dreamed I find the perfect lover,  
  
[Barbra]  
But he turned out to be like every other man  
  
[Both]  
I had no choice from the start  
I've gotta listen to my heart  
Tearing us apart  
  
Enough is enough is enough  
I can't go on, I can't go on no more no  
Enough is enough is enough  
I want him out, I want him out that door now  
  
Goodbye mister, goodbye, goodbye mister  
Goodbye sugar  
  
It's raining, it's pouring,  
There's nothing left for us here  
And we won't waist another tear  
  
No more tears  
Is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough is enough  
Is enough!

Am I helpless to refrain  
Like a jail it's so insane  
Am I disatisfied with love or unamused  
An incapacitated heart  
A long-shot fired in the dark  
I never knew that I could care so much  
At last the world will know  
That this is, this is no, no ordinary love song  
Oh no, no ordinary love song  
Oh no  
A man, a man who hoped so long  
So long to find  
If I could be your love song  
Oh yes  
Your one eternal love song  
Oh yes  
Sometimes when I turn  
You're standing unaware  
And I am filled with desire,  
Then again despair  
What can I do?  
Please tell me, can't I make you see?  
You're everything I need  
You are the missing key  
I'll be your instrument of love  
You play every chord in me  
At last the world will know  
That this is, this is no, no ordinary love song  
Oh no, no ordinary love song  
A girl, a girl who hoped so long  
So long to find  
If I could be your love song  
Oh yes  
Your one eternal love song  
Oh yes  
Sometimes when I turn  
You're standing unaware  
And I'm filled with desire,  
Then again despair  
What can I do?  
Please tell me, can't I make you see?  
You're everything I need  
You are the missing key  
I'll be your instrument of love  
You play every chord in me  
Sometimes when I turn  
You're standing unaware  
I'm filled with desire,  
Then again despair  
What can I do?  
Please tell me, can't I make you see?  
You're everything I need  
You are the missing key  
I'll be your instrument of love  
You play every chord in me  
Play me, play me, play me  
I love you

Hey you, over there  
Come on down out of my sky  
I've been a long long time waiting  
Wonder why  
Some people say say  
They say that love comes only once  
Some people say say  
They say that love comes only once  
But oh, life is like a rolling stone  
God bless the child who's got his own yeah  
A million times in a million ways  
I'd give my life just hear  
To hear somebody say  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Life can bring some tragedy sometimes  
So don't keep looking at the bad things  
Sometimes love can even blow your little mind  
Now I've seen it starting to happen  
You've gotta believe in the good things  
Believe in the good things  
You gotta believe that there's something that hold us in a sunny place  
You gotta believe that the sky won't fall  
Believe that's it's worth it all  
You gotta believe that there's light at the end of the tunnel  
And I know bad things sometimes happen for nothing  
But there's got to be reason we all found each other  
That we live and breathe and we need somebody else  
That's what I said  
  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
Nobody, nobody, nobody  
Can ever love you the way I do  
And I really do  
  
Like a river running wild  
Like a river running wild  
I wanna walk down a down a country mile, oh baby  
No no nobody loves me  
No no nobody loves you  
The way I do  
No one can love you the way I do  
Nobody no no nobody baby  
Can ever love you like I do  
And I really do  
Oh baby  
I really do  
Oh baby  
I really do  
I love you  
Baby I love you

Once upon a time  
There was a girl  
Who lived in the land  
Of dreams unreal  
  
Hiding from reality  
Treated like a stranger  
Living in her fantasies  
Trapped within their world  
  
Once upon a time  
Her hopes had died  
No one there to hear  
Her futile cries  
  
Living in a house of stone  
No one on her side  
Family in name alone  
No place left to hide  
Aah!  
  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
Once upon a time  
  
Once upon a dream  
A man will come  
And give her everything  
She wants and loves  
  
But in the morning  
She'll awake  
To face the room around her  
It's just another lonely day,  
  
And bitterness surrounds her  
Bitterness surrounds her  
Aah!

There's more to question than answers  
and sand will slip through your hands  
and love is faster than lightning  
so grab it while you can mm, mm, mm...  
  
Well I've been searching forever  
between the bad and the good  
but now I know what I'm missing  
and I wanna make it with you  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and babe it's gotta be tonight  
babe it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it should be tonight  
baby it should be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one night, one night, one night  
in a lifetime, one night  
  
They say that love is a gamble  
and luck will play a trick or two  
but I'll risk all of my loving  
I'd put my last buck on you  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it's gotta be tonight  
Baby it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it's gotta be tonight  
Baby it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one night, one night, one night  
in a lifetime, one night  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it's gotta be tonight  
baby it's gotta be tonight  
  
One night in a lifetime  
one life in a night  
one night in a lifetime  
and baby it should be tonight  
baby it should be tonight

You're one of a kind  
I gotta have ya  
Well you're one of a kind  
I need to have ya  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart  
You're one of a kind  
You've got magic  
I know you're one of a kind  
Baby you're static  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart  
Right from the start  
You tore me apart  
You took the best part of my heart  
Body and soul  
You took me out of control  
You stole the best part of my heart  

Spoken:  
You know ladies and gentlemen  
Please know this  
I really love my man  
And I want, exactly what he's got  
And I don't ever mind giving him every  
Bit of my love  
And baby you know  
I've got a lot to give  
I got fire in my touch  
There's nothing I won't do  
And I bend over backwards  
Just to give it all to you  
Cause there's only one man  
That can handle all this love  
Cause there's only one man  
That I want to be with tonight  
Cause there's only one man  
That can squeeze me inside  
The one man in my life  
And that's you, you and you and you  
Cause there's only one man  
That can handle all this love  
Cause there's only one man  
That I want to be with tonight  
Said there's only one man in my life  
And that's you  

Dropping you this line to give you peace,  
And to set your weary mind at ease  
I know that it's rough when you're so far away  
Listen to the words I have to say  
  
Sometimes when you're gone, I don't know why  
I find the simple need to sit and cry  
It's not that I'm lonely or, that I'm blue  
It's just that I need to be with you  
  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
  
When I know our love is going strong  
And I have all I need to carry on  
And my mind and body seem to understand  
That for me you are the perfect man  
  
Our love, our love, our love  
Will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever  
Our love will last forever

Protection, that's what I need

Knock on the door and rush  
Down the stairs  
When I open up, baby you're  
Not there  
When we're together and ya put  
Your arms around me  
Your love sweeps away all the  
Confusion that surrounds me

And stare out, at the shadows

The winds of life will blow  
They're sure to come and go  
They meet me at a time when I'm calm and feeling fine  
But the captain of my soul is always on board  
He rocks me in his arms  
While I'm riding through the storm  
  
While riding through the storm  
Jesus hold me in his arms  
And I am not afraid of the stormy winds and the rains  
Although clouds become high  
Jesus holds me while I ride  
I find safety in the Master's arms  
While I'm riding through a storm  
  
I have no fear on the raging sea  
Knowing Jesus is there for me  
He can speak to the winds and the wave  
And make them behave  
All power's in his hand  
On sea or dry land  
I find safety in my Master's arms  
While I'm riding through a storm  
Riding through a storm

My baby wears his heart on his sleeve  
He wears a look on his face that says please please please  
Love it  
Everything he flaunts love it  
Everything he vaunts I just  
Can't hesitate when he wants what he wants  
  
Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
  
Last night he calls me on the telephone  
You know at two in the morning I just want to sleep on  
But he's got a way with words and  
He's got a way with charm  
And at three in the morning he's back into my arms  
  
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka  
And I said oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka

He looks so good the girls stop and stare  
But I soon wanna look with his double dark hair

It's a one in million mad mad romance  
  
Oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka, oh chucka

Spent the best of my life running scared  
In the city  
Left my shoes and my clothes and  
My lovers behind, yeah  
Oh but I felt incomplete  
Living out there in the street  
I was always alone and afraid  
Such a pity  
Little girls just don't know what comes  
Out after dark  
But the devil wasn't in here  
Down on that dead end street  
And I say  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
It's take keeping me running  
I'm just scared that he's out tonight  
It's keeping me running  
I don't know why, but its getting dark  
Say the devil's in the park  
And its already after dark  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover, now  
Life is really so hard when you live in the city  
No one know what a young girl  
Has on her mind, yeah  
But you're headed for defect  
Down on that dead end street  
Never learned of the lesson  
You should, such a pity  
Still and all you'll stay away  
The others behind  
And the promise in the dark  
Is that the devil's in the park  
And I say  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
It's take keeping me running  
I'm just scared that he's out tonight  
It's keeping me running  
I don't know why, but its getting dark  
Say the devil's in the park  
And its already after dark  
running for cover  
Running for cover  
Running for cover  
Spent the best of my life running scared  
In the city  
Left my shoes and my clothes and

Say the devil's in the park  
And its already after dark

Wakin' up this morning  
Saw the sun come through my blinds  
And I looked up on the porch  
And found an owl shrieking by  
But never could I have imagined  
Such a place like this  
And you're lyin' next to me  
I wanna wake you with a kiss  
  
And all the crazy things about you  
That I so adore  
Are the little things that keep me  
Coming back for more  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
I will go wherever you go  
Take me where you lead  
Lead me where you want  
My heart doesn't know  
Anything but what you say  
You're the one for me  
You make me feel complete  
  
I can silent read your whisper  
And my lips still feel your touch  
And I'm oh so glad to be here  
Oh so glad to be here  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
But you and I have walked the oceans  
Miles along the shore  
And a thousand seagulls called on me  
So we came right back for more  
And I love to feel the water  
It makes me feel so free  
Underneath the purple sky  
Every time you look at me  
  
I reach up to forever  
With the promises you keep  
They fill me with such happiness  
It makes my heart believe  
  
[Chorus]  
And it feels like love, and it feels so good  
I wanna feel like the roarin' thunder  
Wanna be the heaven that your sky is under  
Oh, I say, you say, oh (It's like love)  
All that I need, baby it's true  
The sand on my feet and you  
  
How many lovers  
Have walked along the shore before  
Before you and I  
How many said goodbye

Mr. Moonlight...shine bright  
Show me my Mr. Right  
Lights, camera, action  
I want to be his sole distraction  
  
Cupid draw your bow  
Shoot it nice and slow  
Send it straight to his heart  
Love don't let him go  
You must let him know  
This is love from the start  
  
(Chorus):  
Say a little prayer  
Say a little prayer for me tonight  
Say a little prayer  
Say a little prayer for my hear tonight  
  
Mama always told me  
(sometimes)  
What you get is not what you see  
I'm not taking any chances  
No more broken romances  
  
Cupid draw your bow fetch  
(Chorus x2)  
I promise to always love and care for him  
And I promise...to do my very best for him  
I promise...to cherish him for all of my life  
  
I promise...to always love and care for him  
And I promise...I'll always be there for him  
I promise...to love him for the rest of my life  
  
(Chorus out).

Say that you like me the way I am  
Just take some time out to understand  
It may not be much, but I do all I can  
Say something nice  
  
I'd never do it to one of you  
I'd say something nice if it wasn't true  
I'd make you feel better when you're feeling blue  
I'd say something nice  
  
Say something nice, only once or twice  
Say something nice, only once or twice  
Say something nice  
  
I want to hear that I'm beautiful  
But you wouldn't say it even if I were  
Wearing my diamonds and a coat of fur  
You wouldn't say nothin' nice  
  
Tell me you think that my hair's real nice  
Don't stand around and just criticize  
Can't you understand that when a person tries  
You say something nice  
  
And it's oh so hard, oh so hard  
To listen to the words that you say  
Oh, say something nice, just once or twice  
It wouldn't hurt, don't you see  
  
I want to hear something nice, say something nice  
Say something nice, just once or twice  
It don't hurt you at all, say something nice  
  
Say something nice baby, only once or twice  
Say something nice  
Say something nice baby, only once or twice  
Say something nice  
  
Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me  
Hey don't you hear me, hey don't you hear me  
  
Say something nice  
Say something nice  
And it's oh so hard, and it's oh so hard  
And I'm dying to hear what I've never heard (fade out)

Chemistry look what you've done to me  
Chemistry brought me near gravity  
Chemistry look what you've done to me  
  
You've called me up  
My heart is pounding  
Can't bear to breath  
I've Just got over you  
  
What do you want  
You like a broken record  
Spinnin' in my head  
Why can't you let me be?  
  
I don't understand  
What it is about you  
The more you reject me  
The more I want from you  
  
You're always on my mind  
Always have been, always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I don't want to, you're a habit  
  
And I'm running and running and  
Running and running away from you  
Every time when you call,  
I come undone can't escape from you  
  
Is it the science of Love?  
Is it the science of Love?  
It's the science of Love  
It's the science of Love  
  
I'm thinking to fight it  
To get away from you  
Something always pulled me  
Right back to you  
  
I don't understand  
What it is about you  
The more you reject me  
The more I want from you  
  
You're always on my mind  
Always have been, always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I don't want to, you?re a habit  
  
And I'm running and running  
and running and running away from you  
Every time when you call,  
I come undone can't escape from you  
  
Is it the science of Love?  
Is it the science of Love?  
I wanna be with you but I'm so afraid  
My heart's not ready cause I'm still in pain  
I'm feeling my love is out of control  
I wanna give up but I can?t let go  
  
You're always on my mind  
Always have been, always will be  
I think about you all the time  
I don't want to, you're a habit  
  
And I'm running and running and  
Running and running away from you  
Every time when you call, I come undone can't escape from you  
Is it the science of Love?  
Is it the science of Love?  
It's the science of Love  
It's the science of Love  
Love is Science

Oh Lord  
  
Ride over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
  
I was just a little girl  
A-making my own way  
16 years or more I had  
Nothing left to say  
  
I raised myself up almost  
Lived on po'boys too  
New Orleans ain't a place to live  
If you never been to school  
  
And I said  
Ride over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
People gotta tell you  
Slide over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Ride over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
Daddy was a working man  
He worked since he was 5  
He dropped his wings on my train one day  
And never learned to fly  
  
I wonder what it takes to be  
Someone who knows why  
The earth ain't round  
Unless you can  
Teach yourself to fly  
  
And I said  
Ride over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
People gotta tell you  
Slide over backwards  
Slide over backwards  
(Sometimes you gotta be free)  
Slide over backwards  
Let me ride  
  
Some days in a lifetime you gotta be strong  
Some days in lifetime you gotta be brave  
Dig on your knees sometimes  
Sometimes you even gotta pray  
  
Lord what it is what it is  
  
Sometimes I feel like I'm going down, going down  
Going down for the very last time  
Oh don't know what it is, don't know what it is  
Sometimes I feel like going down  
  
Deep in my heart I pray  
Ride over backwards

I've been standing in the dark  
Staring out the window at the moon  
With a heartache like I've never known before  
And I can't eat and I can't sleep  
This pain inside, it's like it's killing me  
It's over, he said  
You don't love me anymore  
  
So this is lonely  
Now I know how it feels to lose  
This is lonely  
It's nothing anyone on earth can do  
Only time can heal  
This hurt I feel  
Cause he ain't coming back  
That's what he told me  
Now I'm lonely  
  
He did everything I wanted  
Still I took his love for granted too long, it seems  
There ain't nothing I can do to right this wrong  
And it's too late to turn back time  
And all my tears ain't gonna change his mind  
It's over, he said  
You don't love me anymore  
  
So this is lonely  
Now I know how it feels to lose  
This is lonely  
It's nothing anyone on earth can do  
Only time can heal  
This hurt I feel  
Cause he ain't coming back  
That's what he told me  
Now I'm lonely  
  
This is lonely  
So this is lonely  
It's over, he said  
You don't love me anymore

Someday  
When we are wiser  
When the world's older  
When we have learned  
  
I pray  
Someday we may yet live  
To live and let live  
Someday  
  
Life will be fairer  
Need will be rarer  
And greed will not pay  
God speed  
  
This bright millennium  
On it's way  
Let it come  
Someday  
  
Someday  
Our fight will be won then  
We'll stand in the sun then  
'Til then  
  
On days when the sun is gone  
We'll hang on  
Wish upon the moon  
There are some days dark and bitter  
  
Seems we haven't got a prayer  
But a prayer for someday better  
Is the one thing we all share  
Someday  
Someday soon

There's a somebody I'm longing to see  
I hope that he turns out to be  
Someone who'll watch over me  
  
I'm a little lamb who's lost in a wood  
I know I could always be good  
To one who'll watch over me  
  
Although he may not be the man some girls think of  
As handsome to my heart  
He carries the key  
  
Won't you tell him please to put on some speed  
Follow my lead, oh how I need  
Someone who'll watch over me

Well I told ya not to fall in love  
I ain't the kind you can tie down  
You went did it anyway  
As though I'd done ya harm  
And each time I went reaching out  
That's when you let go  
Now don't try and pretend  
That you didn't know  
Chorus:  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Come on baby set me free  
I've got to be free  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Butterflies were made to fly  
I've got to be free  
Sometimes like butterflies  
Oh don't hold me no no...  
Well I told you right from the beginning  
I couldn't stay for love  
I had to go  
Now it's not because in my heart  
Baby I don't love you  
It's just because I'm meant to be  
I'm meant to be free  
Reapeat chorus  
Now it's not because in my heart  
Baby I don't love you  
It's only that I'm meant to be  
I'm meant to be free  
If you wanna love me  
If you wanna hold me  
Come on baby set me free  
I've got to be free  
If you wanna hold me  
If you wanna love me  
Butterflies were made to fly  
I've got to be free  
Sometimes like butterflies.....

S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
S-T-A-M-P Stampin' on the ground  
  
Woah, yeah  
  
I've been round so many times before  
Broke my back, been split open so oft  
Tried to make it to the finish line  
Been knocked down, get up every single time  
They're up in your face, they don't think you belong  
Man, you got it, you got it goin' on  
What breaks the weak just makes you strong  
You got game, baby bring it on, bring it on  
  
[Chorus:]  
(And) I said Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound  
You ain't goin',  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud  
You ain't going, you ain't goin' down  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud, make the biggest sound  
You ain't goin',  
Stamp your feet on the ground  
Make it really loud  
You ain't goin', you ain't goin' down  
  
Rain comes in every player's life  
Gotta stay in the game, not on the sidelines  
Gotta throw down, you gotta stand and fight  
Keep your eye on the prize, don't get caught up in strife  
Go, go for the shot boy, make that play just right  
Braggin' about your swag won't get you through the night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
S-T-A-M-P You got game  
S-T-A-M-P You got fame  
S-T-A-M-P You got name  
S-T-A-M-P Do that thang  
We ain't going down, oh no!  
Make me proud! Stand up and fight!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Stamp your feet, stamp your feet  
Stamp your feet, stamp your feet  
  
S-T-A-M-P! No, no, no, we ain't goin' down  
S-T-A-M-P! No, no, no, we ain't goin' down  
Right till the ending, we'll make it through life  
Better stamp your feet on the,  
Stamp your feet on the ground

Mama moved out  
Daddy sold the house  
They split up the money  
And went on their way  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together again  
Starting Over Again  
Where should they begin  
'Cause they've never been out on their own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And the whole world cries  
He got an apartment  
She moved in with her sisters  
And he's scheming big deals with one of his friends  
While she sits at home  
Sortin' out pieces  
Of left over memories from thirty odd years  
Starting Over again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting Over Again  
Never any end  
What will the neighbours say  
(Just) talkin' talk it's small town news  
What will all the neighbours hear  
They just know they disappeared  
(They're) facing fifty years old wrecking up a happy home  
And this far down the road  
You find yourself alone  
Two fools  
Starting Over Again  
Where do you begin  
When you've never been out on your own  
Starting over again  
Never any end  
When your dreams are all shattered  
And the kids almost grown  
And all the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Could never put mummy and daddy back together  
Back together anymore.....

State of life, may I live, may I love  
Coming out the sky, I name me a name  
Coming out silver word for what it is  
It is very nature of the sound, the game

Essence of the word

Sounds like a signal from you  
Bring me to meet your sound  
And I will bring you to my heart  
  
Love, like a signal you call  
Touching my body, my soul  
Bring to me, you to meet me here  
  
Home, be the temple of your heart  
Home, be the body of your love  
Just like holy water to my lips

Yes, I do know why I'm alive  
To love and be with you  
Day by day by day by day

I was weak and I was blind  
You know I never ever wanted to put  
Our love on the light  
  
You were right, and I was wrong  
I should have listened to the words  
You said  
But I was too headstrong  
  
So if you've heard this all before  
Don't let me carry on no more  
  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me, stop me  
  
You said I lied, you said I cried  
But I had to say something fast in case  
You threw me aside  
  
I didn't know, I couldn't guess  
If I only would have known I never  
Would have been in this mess  
  
But if you've heard this all before  
Don't let me carry on no more  
  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me, stop me  
  
But if you've heard this all before  
Don't let me carry on no more  
  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one  
Stop me, stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one  
Stop me if you think you've  
Heard this one, this one

Winds may come and winds may blow  
But there's no wind can cure me of my fever  
Summer fever  
Time of love, time of year  
Temperature's rising, our bodies near in fever  
Summer fever, fever, summer fever  
Heat wave run, dog day night  
We're making love, things are right with fever  
Summer fever  
You burn so deep with your love so sweet  
And you satisfy and mystify my fever  
Summer fever, fever, summer fever  
Fever, summer fever  
Body to body, arms entwined  
Locked in your love and feeling fine with fever  
Summer fever

Temperature's rising, our bodies near in fever  
Summer fever, fever, summer fever  
Fever, summer fever, fever, summer fever

We were strangers  
Who one were lovers  
We've been everlasting friends  
  
I was shattered  
When you walked out, boy  
I was walking off the edge  
  
Friends, said i looked so down-hearted  
When you left  
Now my broken heart is stable  
I'm starting to mend  
Got you back and I'm living again  
  
Oh, this must be love  
That sets my soul on fire  
A supernatural love  
(this must be)  
That makes my flame burn higher  
A supernatural love  
  
Life was only tear drops falling down  
From my eyes  
Now my broken heart is stable  
Oh, I'm coming alive  
I can't fight what I'm feeling inside  
  
This must be love  
That sets my soul on fire  
A supernatural love  
(oh, this must be)  
That makes my flame burn higher  
A supernatural love  
That gets me so excited  
A supernatural love  
(oh, this must be)  
That makes us true survivors  
A supernatural love  
  
Friends, said i looked so down-hearted

Somebody's watching from on high  
Distant love is hard to find  
  
Always looking for the right direction, oh yeah

How many times you've gone and spoken out your mind  
Out of line, it's not nice, it's not nice, it's not nice

Father dear, don't you hear me  
I'm alone, and I can't sleep from crying  
Father dear, well if you hear me  
I've been held closely by a stranger  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
So help me find him  
  
Listen, if you find him  
Won't you tell him just how much I love him  
Father, I've only got you  
Please, won't you make him love me too  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
So help me find him  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
Sweet, sweet  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
So help me find him  
  
Father, hear me calling  
You're the only one I can turn to  
My life has been so empty  
And he could fill my emptiness too  
  
Sweet romance  
The moment that my eyes first saw him  
In a glance  
I knew right from the start that I adored him  
Sweet romance  
I may never see the man again, so help me find him  
Help me, help me

Take heart.... Even though you find it hard  
To catch your breath, much less smile  
  
Take heart... Even when your sky is dark  
There'll come a day the clouds will go  
Then you'll know once again what life can be  
When you feel all the joy it can bring...  
  
Chorus:  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
There'll always be a light in your soul  
  
Take heart... In each and every tear your cry  
The strength you need will be yours in time  
  
Take heart... Someday's not that far away  
There is that place where hope will abide  
And you'll find that your heart feels deeper now  
Through the love that's been lost through goodbye  
  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
There'll always be a light in your soul  
  
Always remember to treasure the time  
So man questions with no reason why  
Life passes by... So it goes  
  
If only we could understand what God only knows  
Maybe then it would be easy letting go  
But if the spirit lives forever and true love never dies  
There'll always be a light in your soul

(Tearing down tearing down tearing...)  
I know the rhythm of the music  
I see the beat in the dark  
Emotion got me where I'm with him  
It's so hard to get to your heart  
Fascination you know it brought me to you  
Satisfaction makes me want to  
Want to start by tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
I know I'm only getting so close  
I see you're up on your guard  
Secrets I wanna get to know those  
'Cause down deep I'm after your heart  
All I'm giving is some good old-fashioned love  
(Wanna give it all to ya)  
I wanna give to ya prove it to you  
Let me start by tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart

Satisfaction makes me want to  
Want to start by tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart  
Tearing down the walls  
Tearing down the walls around your heart

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dresses up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said  
Many times many ways  
"Merry Christmas"  
  
Every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said  
Many times many ways  
"Merry Christmas"  
"Merry Christmas"  
"Merry Christmas to you"

There is life in shadowed caverns  
Where the gray-blue gardens grow  
In the forests and the deserts  
In the wind and in the snows  
And it's all the precious cargo  
Of our fragile spaceship earth  
And it's countless voices cry on  
Let us live  
Let us live  
The miracle is that they're here at all in the timeless night  
We are all fabric of life  
This miracle may never come again  
The planet is alive let it live  
Let us live  
In the roaring soaring cities  
In the mills and in the minds  
In the ice fields and the rice fields  
People work and live their lives  
And they strive to raise their children  
Hoping somehow they'll survive  
Is it all to much to ask for  
Let them live  
Let them live  
It's a thousand million light years  
To the farthest fringe of space  
And there may be nothing out there  
Even like the human race  
And we may be all alone then on our tiny island home  
And the planet is alive oh let it live  
Let it live

You must always remember  
Life can be a challenge  
Life can seem impossible  
It's never easy, when so much is on the line  
  
But you can make a difference  
With courage you can set things right  
The gift to dream and make dream real,  
Is yours and mine  
  
The power of one!  
Begins with believing!  
It's starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world!  
Imagine how life will be  
When we stand in unity  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one!  
  
Each of us is chosen  
There's a mission just for you  
Just look inside  
You'll be surprised  
What you can do  
  
The power of one!  
Begins with believing!  
It's starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world!  
Imagine how life will be  
When we stand in unity  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one!  
  
Then one by one  
We can make the world  
A much better place!  
  
The power of  
One!  
Begins with believing!  
It's starts in the heart  
Then flows through the soul  
And changes the world!  
Imagine how life will be!  
When we stand in unity!  
Each of us holds the key  
It's inside of you and me!  
Each of us holds the key  
To the power of one!  
  
The power of one

Woke up this morning  
Dragged myself across the bed  
Alice went to wonderland  
But I stayed home instead  
I started feeling bad  
'Cause I was left behind  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Oh yes, I'm a wanderer  
  
She climbed right through the mirror  
Oh that really blew my mind  
I think I'll follow through her rhythm  
And her rhyme  
I know I'm ready now  
It's just a little time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I'm a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
Slipped down the back stair  
On my toes  
Then out the door  
They didn't hear  
Now they won't  
See me anymore  
'Cause I can't take  
That nine to five life  
It's a bore  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
And so it's up and out  
And on and off the road  
Won't have no troubles  
'Cause the whole world  
Is my home  
No need to worry  
'Cause I seldom am alone  
'Cause I'm wanderer  
I'm a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
Now you may see me  
Any time and any place  
And you may know me  
From the same look  
On your face  
And I don't know if I could  
Change your frame of mind  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Just a wanderer  
  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
I travel every place  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
From here to outer space  
'Cause I'm a wanderer  
Got no time

Spoken:  
Well you ladies out there  
You know what I'm  
I'm talkin' 'bout ya  
But you wanna know something?  
Did you ever try to remember or  
Or just place up a memory in your mind  
And it always seems so far away  
So hard to find  
  
Memories  
Light the corners of my mind  
Misty water-color memories  
Of the way we were  
  
Scattered pictures  
Of the smiles we left behind  
Smiles we gave to one another  
(oh yesterday) for the way we were  
  
Can it be that it was all so simple then  
Or has time rewritten every line  
If we had the change to do it all again  
  
Spoken:  
Tell me, how many of you would live your lives again  
I would too  
You girls?  
  
Memories  
May be beautiful and yet  
What's too painful to remember  
We simply choose to forget  
And so it's the laughter  
We will remember  
Whenever we remember  
  
The way we were  
The way we were  
Whoaaahhhh

Dancin' close feelin' restless  
It's a slow sultry night  
It'll take a lifetime til sunrise  
If you won't stay with me tonight  
Feel your breath caress my shoulder  
As your heart reads my mind  
You don't have to tell me anything  
I can see everything in your eyes  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me  
Baby there's so much no man has ever touched of the woman in me  
I might be trembling,  
But I'm not scared  
Just my desire breaking free  
I've never had a chance like this before  
To unlock all the doors to the woman in me  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free  
To be the woman in me  
Like the dark side of the full moon  
I've never shown what I've showing to you  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse  
To be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in me  
It's so easy with you  
I don't need an excuse to be the woman in me  
It's so hard to believe that I'm feeling so free to be the woman in  
Me

[Voice monologue over "Once Upon A Time" instrumental]  
  
Once upon a time, there was a girl  
She lived in the land of never-never  
Where everything real is unreal  
And only fairy tales come true  
Something like me and you  
  
But she believed that what she dreamed of could be real  
So she strived on to make it come true  
Fighting odds, not knowing what would come of her  
Never giving up the hope within her  
  
She carried on and on, because she believed  
That once, once in a time in her lifetime  
The things so unreal would be real  
  
And in the morning, one day when she awoke  
To find herself surrounded by the same old room  
She was disappointed  
  
So she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she dreamed and she dreamed and she dreamed  
And she said that fairy tales do come true  
'Cause I believe, I believe  
  
And she kept trying, and she kept right on fighting  
Till one day she met a man who held her tight  
And she fell in love  
  
Once upon a time, in the land of never-never  
Where all things real are unreal  
There lived a girl who believed  
That all things could be possible  
  
And one day she did awake  
And found herself somewhere else  
Beside her a brand new face  
Of someone that she loved

Theme to Dream a Lot (I will live for love) By, Donna Summers  
  
There's got to be a way that I can dream  
Simply close my eyes and see  
The worlds I've never known  
What places that my soul has been  
  
Sometimes I need to run away and hide  
I sail along so high  
Till nothing's in my sky  
Except the stars that fill my eyes  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm searching for the one who holds the key  
To all this crazy life I lead  
Through galaxies in time  
A solitary star that joins  
  
Sometimes I need to close my eyes and breathe  
Inhale what life has given me  
A bastion to ignite  
A flaming heart in flight  
I close my eyes  
I breathe  
I'm free  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I've always must have known  
A lover of his own  
'Cause that is when he wrote  
Everything I felt for love  
  
And I will fight for love in life and in love  
And I will hold the things above  
I'm strong enough to slay the dragon that's there  
I will live for love  
  
I've thought about this life  
This dream will never die  
So only know that I  
I will live for love  
  
Always must have known a lover of his own  
That is when he wrote everything I felt for love  
I will ever fight  
I will live for life  
I will live for love

All alone I sit looking out of the window  
And the rain just keeps coming on down  
Well I cry to myself  
So many things that I've done wrong  
Now I'm watching you walk out  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Where is he going  
How is he what is he gonna do  
Where is he going  
And what on earth will he be going through oh  
  
There goes my baby  
Moving on down the line  
Wonder where, wonder where  
Wonder where he is bound  
  
I broke his heart  
And made him cry  
Now I'm alone, so all alone  
What can I do, what can I do  
  
Sing this song forever  
Till we're back together

The moon retreats behind a silver cloud  
As darkness throws its cloak towards the earth  
And mystery replaces what thought we knew  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
The one dimension only shows one side  
But do we see the same through different eyes  
As you and I peer into life's kaleidoscope  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
Eternal sands of time shift endlessly  
Behind a veil of motionless disguise  
An eyelid flash is all it really seems to need  
  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone  
To turn the stone, to turn the stone

On big alley stands a lady waiting  
For awhile  
Acting out an untold story like a  
Wounded child  
But the mystery of the circumstance  
Won't hide  
She believes true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Waiting for her long lost lover  
Returning from the war  
Though I know she knew the truth  
She also knew much more  
And the answer that she gave to all of us  
Whispered low saying  
True love survives  
True love survives  
  
Is she dreaming does she know  
A secret I can't see  
Maybe there's a trace of truth  
In all that she believes  
  
For one day I took a look deep down inside  
A voice cried saying true love's alive  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
Only love will last forever true love will survive  
  
True is love is never-ending  
It's giving all and not pretending  
It's holding on although your heart  
Feels dead  
  
A quarter of a century of years  
Have gone by  
Still the dream of this peculiar  
Lady's kept alive  
So I'm holding tight to one who I desired  
A burning fire saying true love survives  
True love survives  
  
Only love will last forever  
Only love will last forever

You've got an easy way to make me cry  
My love for you

That you know just what to do  
  
We can make it, if we try  
We can make it, touch the sky  
We can make it, if we try  
We can make it, get on high  
  
I want to come up there with you right now  
And reach the stormy top  
I want to hold on tight with all my might  
And pray you'll never stop

We can make it, touch the sky  
We can make it, if we try

Try me I know we can make it  
I know if we try...

What a man  
You know it's a bright and shiny day  
I want to say something to you  
I love you just like ja do  
  
We know a place  
Where ja's people can run free  
A new kind of love  
And we call it agape  
Don't take too long to find  
True love transcends all time  
That non-reacting, everlasting love  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Give me your unconditional love  
The kind of love I deserve  
The kind I want to return  
  
Don't try to change or tear your  
Brother down  
Let him make his mistakes  
And he will come around  
Hasten just to pray and ja's true  
Word obey  
In non-reacting, everlasting love  
  
[Chorus: x3]  
  
Give me your unconditional love  
My torn heart to discern  
This agape love to learn  
  
Hasten just to pray and ja's true  
Word obey  
In non-reacting, everlasting love  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Look at the lady with the crazy stare in her eyes  
Looks way past 50 though she's barely 35  
Sleeps most days in the city park  
Every night down at Casey's bar  
And if she talks at all you hear her say  
"I was a lovely girl in my younger days"  
She was the prettiest girl this town had ever seen  
But she dressed too gaudy for the likes of the people here  
Out every night living life to the full  
A string of men at her beck and call  
But smalltown people got smalltown ways  
And soon she was stuck with a brandnew name  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Lover of lovers  
How many others  
Your bed is never empty  
It must bring you plenty  
Oh that fateful night there was thunder in the air  
The women were angry and the men felt like a share  
A lynch mob frenzy came over the town  
Grabbed hold of Mary, threw her down to the ground  
The first man there that had Mary laid  
Staggered back with shock on his face  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Be true to your name  
We've put you to shame  
You're not what we thought  
The victim of talk!  
Hey Virgin Mary  
Rumour was your ruin  
Evil talk was your undoing  
Heavy on the conscience  
Jealous talk and nonsense  
You were really like your name  
And we put you to shame  
You're not really what we thought  
Jealous talk and nonsense

Voices cryin' out, voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out in the night hear them call  
Voices cryin' out hear them call  
It's a night  
Like no other night  
It's a day  
Almost turning gray  
It's a heart  
Like a broken heart  
It's a wheel  
At the end of day  
It's the plight  
Of a boy who's scared  
Of the waves rushing out  
And the wind in the air  
It's the sight  
Of one longing to taste  
Of life  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Visions that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
It's a song  
Of a love unsung  
It's the pain  
Of just being young  
It's a cry  
Of a voice unheard  
Of a face  
Speaking silent words  
It's the hope  
That the time goes by  
Take you upon a wing  
Teach your soul to fly  
It's a wish  
That you'll live your experience life  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
Oh do you know how it feels to be free  
Walking your path of life  
Embracing destiny one day at a time  
Voices cryin' out...oh can't you hear them  
Voices cryin' out...listen please, listen to the future  
Voices cryin' out...millions and millions and millions of voices  
Voices cryin' out...oh oh oh oh  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices crying out hear them call  
Voices crying out in the night hear them call  
Voices from some foreign shore  
Vision that seem an incredible dream  
Echoing for more  
Voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out  
Voices cryin' out...
