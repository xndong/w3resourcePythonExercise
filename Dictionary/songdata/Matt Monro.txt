We were fools you and I  
Now we know it  
We stood still as the days moved along  
Love was ours but our eyes didn't show it  
Suddenly we can see we were wrong  
  
All of a sudden this world's yours and mine  
All of a sudden water tastes like wine  
Now every moment there are songs to sing  
All of a sudden everything  
  
Let's not talk of all the times we've been lonely  
But let us speak of the times we will know  
From today I will live for you only  
Wish I'd said all these things long ago  
  
All of a sudden this world's yours and mine  
All of a sudden water tastes like wine  
Now every moment there are songs to sing  
All of a sudden everything  
  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la

Come to me  
Before you say goodbye  
Hold me close  
Before I start to cry  
  
I will miss you more  
Than you can ever know  
So kiss me once again  
Before you go  
  
I long with all my heart  
For you to stay with me  
But I know  
That this can never be  
  
Only yesterday  
You said we'd never part  
And now you leave me forsaken  
Along with this ache in my heart  
  
Though our love is an ember  
My darling remember  
I love you so  
  
Just kiss me once again  
Before you go  
Before you leave me now  
Before you go  
  
Though our love is an ember  
My darling remember  
I love you so  
  
Just kiss me once again  
Before you go  
Before you leave me now  
Before you go

Gonna build a mountain From a little hill  
Gonna build a mountain Least I hope I will  
Gonna build a mountain Gonna build it high  
I don't know how I'm gonna do it I only know I'm gonna try  
Gonna build a daydream From a little hope  
Gonna push that daydream Up the mountain slope  
Gonna build a daydream Gonna see it through  
Gonna build a mountain and a daydream  
Gonna make 'em both come true  
Gonna build a heaven From a little hell  
Gonna build a heaven And I know darned well  
If I build my mountain With a lot of care  
And take my daydream up the mountain Heaven will be  
  
Waiting there  
Gonna build a mountain From a little hell  
Gonna build a heaven And I know darned well  
With a fine young son Who will take my place  
There'll be a sun in my heaven on earth with the lord's good grace  
When I build that heaven As I will some day  
Gonna build a new life Throw the old away  
You and I together Gonna make life swing  
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness  
Gonna make the whole world swing  
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness  
Gonna make the whole world swing  
We'll fill tomorrow full of happiness  
Make the whole world swing

Here's to my lady, here's a toast to my lady,  
And all that my lady means to me!  
Like a hearth in the winter, a breeze in the summer,  
A spring to remember is she!  
  
Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,  
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!  
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady,  
I pray may she always love me!  
  
Though the years may grow colder as people grow older,  
It's shoulder to shoulder we'll be!  
But be it sunshine or shady, here's my love to my lady,  
I pray may she always love me!

Candy apple lips so red  
Lips that I've made mine  
One look at you and I knew  
Honey on the vine  
  
Sugar in my coffee cup  
Sweetness in my wine  
Can't compare with love you share  
Honey on the vine  
  
When you walk in my front door  
The lemon tree cries  
It can't compare with love you've got  
Sweet honey on the vine  
  
Take a walk down lovers lane  
Your hand holding mine  
I think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine  
  
When you walk in my front door  
The lemon tree cries  
It can't compare with love you've got  
Sweet honey on the vine  
  
Take a walk down lovers lane  
Your hand holding mine  
I think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine  
  
I think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine  
Think I'll die, getting my  
Honey on the vine

Maybe it happens this way  
Maybe we really belong together  
But after all, how little we know  
  
Maybe it's just for a day  
Love is as changeable as the weather  
And after all, how little we know  
  
Who knows why an April breeze never remains  
Why stars in the trees hide when it rains  
Love comes along, casting a spell  
Will it sing you a song  
Will it say a farewell  
Who can tell  
  
Maybe you're meant to be mine  
Maybe I'm only supposed to stay in your arms a while  
As others have done  
  
Is this what I've waited for, am I the one  
Oh, I hope in my heart that it's so  
In spite of how little we know  
  
Is this what I've waited for, am I the one  
Oh, I hope in my heart that it's so  
In spite of how little we know

I have dreamed that your arms are lovely  
And I have dreamed what a joy you'll be  
I have dreamed every word you'll whisper  
When you're close, close to me  
  
How you look in the glow of evening  
I have dreamed and enjoyed the view  
In these dreams I've loved you so  
That by now I think I know  
What it's like to be loved by you  
I will love being loved by you  
  
In these dreams I've loved you so  
That by now I think I know  
What it's like to be loved by you  
I will love being loved by you

Oh I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
When you whisper I love you and tell me that you're true  
I know I'm so lucky that I've found a girl like you  
Oh I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
When we're walking together you slip your hand in mind  
I know I'm so lucky that I've found a girl so fine  
I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
When you touch me and hold me and kiss me tenderly I know  
I'm so lucky  
That you came along for me-e-e  
I love the little things you say  
And I love the little things you do  
Let's stay forever together this way  
My love I'm so in love with you  
My love I'm so in love with you

If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're back beside me, till I'm holding you  
Till I hear you sigh here in my arms  
  
Anywhere you wander, anywhere you go  
Every day remember how I love you so  
In your heart believe what in my heart I know  
That forevermore I will wait for you  
  
The clock will tick away the hours one by one  
Then the time will come when all the waiting's done  
The time when you return and find me here and run  
Straight to my waiting arms  
  
If it takes forever I will wait for you  
For a thousand summers I will wait for you  
Till you're here beside me, till I'm touching you  
And forevermore sharing your love

More than the greatest love  
The world has known  
This is the love I'll give  
To you alone  
  
More than the simple words  
I try to say  
I only live to love you  
Every day  
  
More than you'll ever know  
My arms long to hold you so  
My life will be in your keeping  
Waking, sleeping, laughing, weeping  
  
Longer than always  
Is a long long time  
But far beyond for ever  
You'll be mine  
  
I know I've never lived before  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else  
Could love you more  
  
Longer than always  
Is a long long time  
But far beyond for ever  
You'll be mine  
  
I know I've never lived before  
And my heart is very sure  
No one else  
Could love you more

She walks like an angel walks  
She talks like an angel talks  
And her hair has a kind of curl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
She's wise like an angel's wise  
With eyes like an angel's eyes  
And a smile kind of like a pearl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
Pretty little face  
That face just knocks me off my feet  
Pretty little feet  
She's really sweet enough to eat  
  
She looks like an angel looks  
She cooks like an angel cooks  
And my mind's in a kind of whirl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
Pretty little face  
That face just knocks me off of my feet  
Pretty little feet  
She's really sweet enough to eat  
  
She looks like an angel looks  
She even cooks like an angel cooks  
And my mind's in a kind of whirl  
To my mind, she's my kind of girl  
  
And my heart's kind of full of joy  
'Cause she told me, I'm her kind of boy

Somewhere over the rainbow  
Way up high  
There's a land that I heard of  
Once in a lullaby  
  
Somewhere over that rainbow  
Skies are blue  
And the dreams  
That you dare to dream  
Really do come true  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops  
Way above the chimney tops  
That's where you'll find me  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow  
Bluebirds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?  
  
If happy little bluebirds fly  
Beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?

People,  
People who need people,  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
We're children, needing other children  
And yet letting a grown-up pride  
Hide all the need inside  
Acting more like children than children  
Lovers are very special people  
They're the luckiest people in the world  
With one person one very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul  
Says you were half now you're whole  
No more hunger and thirst  
  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world  
With one person one very special person  
A feeling deep in your soul  
Says you were half now you're whole  
No more hunger and thirst  
But first be a person who needs people  
People who need people  
Are the luckiest people in the world

There could never be a portrait of my love  
For nobody could paint a dream  
You will never see a portrait of my love  
For miracles are never seen.  
  
Anyone who sees her, soon forgets the Mona Lisa  
  
It would take I know, a Michelangelo  
And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above  
To try and paint a portrait of my love  
  
It would take I know, a Michelangelo  
And he would need the glow of dawn that paints the sky above,  
To try and paint a portrait of my love

When I was a young man courting the girls  
I played me a waiting game  
If a maid refused me with tossing curls  
I'd let the old Earth make a couple of whirls  
While I plied her with tears in lieu of pearls  
And as time came around she came my way  
As time came around, she came  
  
Oh, it's a long long while from May to December  
But the days grow short when you reach September  
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame  
And you ain't got time for waiting game  
  
When days dwindle down to a precious few  
September November,  
And these few golden days I'd share with you  
Those golden days I share with you  
  
When you meet with the young girls early in the Spring  
You court them in song and rhyme  
They answer with words and a clover ring  
But if you could examine the goods they bring  
They have little to offer but the songs they sing  
And the plentiful waste of time of day  
A plentiful waste of time  
  
Oh, it's a long, long while from May to December  
But the days grow short when you reach September  
When the autumn weather turns the leaves to flame  
One hasn't got time for the waiting game  
  
Oh, the days dwindle down to a precious few  
September, November  
And these few precious days I'll spend with you  
These precious days I'll spend with you

Softly, I will leave you softly  
For my heart would break if you should wake and see me go  
So I leave you softly, long before you miss me  
Long before your arms can beg me stay  
For one more hour or one more day  
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall  
So, softly as I leave you there  
(Softly, long before you kiss me)  
(Long before your arms can beg me stay)  
(For one more hour) or one more day  
After all the years, I can't bear the tears to fall  
So, softly as I leave you there  
As I leave I you there  
As I leave I you there

There's a place for us,  
Somewhere a place for us.  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us Somewhere.  
  
There's a time for us,  
Someday a time for us,  
Time together with time to spare,  
Time to learn, time to care,  
Some day! Somewhere.  
  
We'll find a new way of living,  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us,  
A time and place for us.  
  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there.  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.  
Somehow, Someday, Somewhere!  
  
Some day! Somewhere.  
We'll find a new way of living, We'll find a way of  
Forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us,  
A time and place for us.  
Hold my hand and we're halfway there.  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there.  
Somehow, Someday, Somewhere!

Blue Spanish eyes  
Teardrops are falling from your Spanish eyes  
Please please don't cry,  
This is just adios and not good-bye  
Soon I'll return,  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si Si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
  
Ummmm spanish eyes... And all of maxico  
  
To spanish eyes  
Please smile for me once more before I go  
  
Soon I'll return,  
Bringing you all the love your heart can hold  
Please say "Si Si"  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me  
Say you and your Spanish eyes will wait for me

Strangers in the night exchanging glances  
Wond'ring in the night  
What were the chances we'd be sharing love  
Before the night was through.  
  
Something in your eyes was so inviting,  
Something in your smile was so exciting,  
Something in my heart,  
Told me I must have you.  
  
Strangers in the night, two lonely people  
We were strangers in the night  
Up to the moment  
When we said our first hello.  
Little did we know  
Love was just a glance away,  
A warm embracing dance away  
  
And ever since that night we've been together.  
Lovers at first sight, in love forever.  
It turned out so right,  
For strangers in the night.  
  
Ever since that night we've been together.  
Lovers at first sight, in love forever.  
It turned out so right,  
For strangers in the night.  
For strangers in the night.

To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
To run where the brave dare not go  
To right the unrightable wrong  
To love pure and chaste from afar  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
This is my quest To follow that star  
No matter how hopeless No matter how far  
To fight for the right Without question or pause  
To be willing to march into hell for a heavenly cause  
And I know if I'll only be true To this glorious quest  
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm  
When I'm laid to my rest  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable stars

Baby you're improvabe  
It won't Take long  
Mountains can be movable  
If the spirit's strong  
You've got possibilities  
Takes a fella to tell  
You've got possibilities  
Let me pry you from your shell  
  
Somewhere way down deep in you There's life No doubt  
It's just been asleep in you Let me bring it out Yes  
You've got possibilities Maybe even a lot  
Redhot possibilities You don't even know you've got  
You won't be shy When I get through  
I'll make you purr You pussycat you  
Somewhere way down deep in you There's life No doubt  
It's just been asleep in you Let me bring it out Yes  
You've got possibilities Maybe even a lot  
Redhot possibilities You don't even know you've got
