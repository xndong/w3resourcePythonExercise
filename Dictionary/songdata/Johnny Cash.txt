I'm comin' Lord, for my heavenly reward  
I'm comin' home to you, can you see me comin' thru  
Thru clouds of persecution, and stumblin' on my way  
I 'spect I'm only makin', 'bout a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,  
It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land  
But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,  
Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day  
  
Lord, when I let you lead, I never make much speed  
"Cause I have to stop and touch, the ones who need so much  
Then sometimes others pull me, off of Your narrow way  
And by my mistakes, I barely make, a half a mile a day  
  
The road to heaven doesn't have a rapid transit plan,  
It's one way with no changes heading to the promised land  
But I believe that if I'll heed the things He had to say,  
Even I might get to heaven at a half a mile a day

I'm not a savior and I'm not a saint  
The man with the answers, I certainly ain't  
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong  
I'm just a singer of songs  
But I can take you for a walk along a little country stream  
I can make you see through lovers eyes and understand their dreams  
I can help you hear a baby's laugh and feel the joy it brings  
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing  
I'm not a prophet and I'm not a priest  
I'm not a wise man who's come from the East  
I wouldn't tell you what's right or what's wrong  
I'm just a singer of songs  
But I can take you to a city where a Man was crucified  
I can tell you how He lived and I can tell you why He died  
I can help proclaim the glory of this Mighty King of kings  
Yes, I can do it with the songs I sing  
I'm not a great man, I don't claim to be  
But when I meet my Maker and He questions me  
I won't hang my head, I'll stand proud and strong  
And say, "I was a singer, Lord, I was a singer  
Yes, I was a singer of songs"  

Six foot six he stood on the ground,  
He weighed two hundred and thirty-five pounds,  
But I saw that giant of a man brought down to his knees by love.  
He was the kind of a man that would gamble on luck,  
Look you in the eye and never back up,  
But I saw him crying like a little whipped pup because of love.  
You can't see it with your eyes,  
Hold it in your hand.  
But like the wind, it covers our land,  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,  
This thing called love.  
It can lift you up,  
Never let you down,  
Take your world and turn it all around,  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.  
Most men are like me, they struggle in doubt,  
They trouble their minds day in and day out,  
Too busy with living to worry about a little word like love.  
But when I see a mother's tenderness,  
As she holds her young close to her breast,  
Then I thank god that the world's been blessed with a thing called love.  
You can't see it with your eyes,  
Hold it in your hand.  
But like the wind, it covers our land,  
Strong enough to move the heart of any man,  
This thing called love.  
It can lift you up,  
Never let you down,  
Take your world and turn it all around,  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.  
Ever since time, nothing's ever been found,  
That's stronger than love.

Every town has its town bum  
I guess ours had one  
Here's a song about him, I remember him fondly  
Well his name was Abner Brown  
I knew an old drunk named Abner Brown  
And nobody knew when he came to town  
But he spread good will to his fellow men  
And they let him sleep in the cotton gin  
He could drink more brew than an army could  
But he had more friends and he did more good  
Than a lot of fine fancy people in our town  
So they tolerated Abner Brown  
And all us kids were on his side  
'Cause he told us tales till our eyes grew wide  
And he made us feel bout ten feet tall  
'Cause he had no kids but he claimed us all  
And after school and on weekends  
You could find me down at the cotton gin  
The truest friend that I ever found was  
A good old drunk named Abner Brown  
Abner Brown, I wish that I could see you once again  
I believe that you'd stack up with all the mighty men  
I've met and known in all the low  
And higher places that I've been  
Thinking of you picks me up when I'm feeling down  
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown  
Lord take me back to the cotton land  
To Arkansas take me home again  
Let me be the boy that I once have been  
Let me walk that road to the cotton gin  
He's probably dead many years ago  
And gone the way that old drunks go  
But I'd still like to sit me down  
Talk to my old friend, Abner Brown  
Abner Brown, I wish  
I thank the Lord for making Abner Brown  

Accidentally I saw you this morning you were lovely dressed in your wedding
gown  
And they say that you married a stranger to me that had drifted to our old
hometown  
Accidentally you've met him one evening and you say it was love at first sight  
Accidentally on purpose you've married accidentally on purpose for spite  
Cause I saw out cheating and running around  
And I was just a fool with a heart of a clown  
Accidentally you were mistaken that night accidentally on purpose for spite  
  
Cause I saw out cheating

We have drifted apart  
Broken hearts, me and you  
After all of this time  
I'm satisfied inside to know  
  
This memory that I had  
It's more good than bad  
You taught me how to sing  
And bring you love  
  
After all this time  
You're still a friend of mine  
So I believe in someone  
After all  
  
Our love didn't last long  
What went wrong?  
Who's to say?  
  
If you never been by  
How then could I  
Begin to say  
  
After all this time  
And you're still a friend of mine  
So I believe in someone  
After all  
  
After all this time  
You're still a friend of mine  
So I believe in someone  
After all

I feel so good come payday  
I think of all the things I'm gonna  
Buy when I pick up my pay  
Don't you know, but then they hand me  
That little brown envelope  
I peep inside, Lord I lose all hope  
'Cause from those total wages earned  
Down to that net amount that's due  
I feel the painful sense of loss between the two  
There goes that bracelet for her arm  
There goes that new fence for my farm  
There goes that brand new Pontiac  
There goes the shirt right off my back  
You can dream about a honeymoon for two  
You can dream but that's about all you can do  
'Cause by the time old Uncle Sam gets through with you  
You can buy her a pair of hose  
A little powder for her nose  
And take her down to Sloppy Joe's for beer  
And stew them are the facts after tax  
You can dream about vacation in the sun  
You can dream but you can't never have you one  
'Cause by the time your good old Uncle Sam gets done  
You've got just enough for gas  
To see them city limits pass  
And if you get back home fourth class  
I'd say you won  
There goes that bracelet for her arm  
There goes that new fence for my farm  
Send back that short wave radio cancel that trip to Mexico  
Forget that brand new Pontiac  
There goes the shirt right off my back  

Well, I asked an old truck driver  
About life out on the road  
If he does a lotta singing  
When he's bringing in his load  
If there's a pretty waitress crying for him  
Every hundred miles  
If he gets a lotta loving  
If he has a lot of smiles  
And I asked him if those trucking songs  
Tell about a life like his  
He said, if you want to know the truth about it  
Here's the way it is  
All I do is drive, drive, drive  
Try to stay alive  
And keep my mind on my load  
Keep my eye upon the road  
I got nothin' in common with any man  
Who's home every day at five  
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive  
Well, we shared a cup of coffee  
Then I had to warm it up  
And his greasy fingers trembled  
As he held onto the cup  
And I said, don't you hear a lot of music  
See a lot of sights  
But if you'll tune into the Grand Ole Opry  
Saturday night  
I will dedicate you a trucking song  
To which you can relate  
He said, you just do the singing  
And I'll do the driving mate  
All I do is drive, drive, drive  
Try to stay alive  
And keep my mind on my load  
Keep my eye upon the road  
I got nothin' in common with any man  
Who's home every day at five  
All I do is drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive, drive  
If I can get the fuel  
Fuel  

I'd sing more about moral of this land but all God's children ain't free  
I'd open up every door I can cause all God's children ain't free  
I met a beaten broken man he shovels dirt but got no land  
And he held out his hand to me all God's children ain't free  
  
I'd sing along too a silly song but all God's children ain't free  
I'm gonna sing the blues for the men they done wrong  
'Cause all God's children ain't free  
Mister how bout the man you condemn to die  
  
But taking everything that he's livin' by  
And reject him from society all God's children ain't free  
No reject him from society all God's children ain't free  
  
[Harmonica]  
  
I'd be happy walking any street but all God's children ain't free  
I'd have a smile for all I meet but all God's children ain't free  
I'd whistle down the road but I wouldn't feel right  
I'd hear somebody cryin' out at night  
  
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free  
From a sharecropper shack or penitentiary all God's children ain't free

Every time I look at you I fall in love, all over again  
Every time I think of you it all begins, all over again  
  
One little dream at night and I can dream all day  
It only takes a memory to thrill me  
One little kiss from you and I just fly away  
Pour me out your love until you fill me  
  
I wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again  
Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again  
  
One little dream at night and I can dream all day  
It only takes a memory to thrill me  
One little kiss from you and I just fly away  
Pour me out your love until you fill me  
  
I wanna fall in love beginning from the start, all over again  
Show me how you stole away my heart, all over again  
  
All over again, all over again, all over again, all over again  
All over again

When I'm alone I often think of an old house on the hill  
Of a big yard hedged in roses where we ran and played at will  
And when the night time brought us home hushing our merry din  
Mother would look around and ask are all the children in  
Well it's been many a year now and the old house on the hill  
No longer has my mother's care and the yard is still so still  
But if I listen I can hear it all no matter how long it's been  
I seem to hear my mother ask are all the children in  
And I wonder when the curtain falls on that last earthly day  
When we say goodbye to all of this to our pain and work and play  
When we step across the river where mother so long has been  
Will we hear ask her a final time are all the children in (I come)

As long as the moon shall rise as long as the rivers flow  
As long as the sun will shine as long as the grass shall grow  
The Senecas are an Indian tribe of the Iroquios nation  
Down on the New York Pennsylvania Line you'll find their reservation  
After the US revolution corn planter was a chief  
He told the tribe these men they could trust that was his true belief  
He went down to Independence Hall and there was a treaty signed  
That promised peace with the USA and Indian rights combined  
George Washington gave his signature the Government gave its hand  
They said that now and forever more that this was Indian land  
As long as the moon shall rise...  
On the Seneca reservation there is much sadness now  
Washington's treaty has been broken and there is no hope no how  
Across the Allegheny River they're throwing up a dam  
It will flood the Indian country a proud day for Uncle Sam  
It has broke the ancient treaty with a politician's grin  
It will drown the Indians graveyards corn planter can you swim  
The earth is mother to the the Senecas they're trampling sacred ground  
Change the mint green earth to black mud flats as honor hobbles down  
As long as the moon shall rise...  
The Iroquios Indians used to rule from Canada way south  
But no one fears the Indians now and smiles the liar's mouth  
The Senecas hired an expert to figure another site  
But the great good army engineers said that he had no right  
Although he showed them another plan and showed them another way  
They laughed in his face and said no deal Kinuza dam is here to stay  
Congress turned the Indians down brushed off the Indians plea  
So the Senecas have renamed the dam they call it Lake Perfidy  
As long as the moon shall rise...  
Washington Adams and Kennedy now hear their pledges ring  
The treaties are safe we'll keep our word but what is that gurgling  
It's the back water from Perfidy Lake it's rising all the time  
Over the homes and over the fields and over the promises fine  
No boats will sail on Lake Perfidy in winter it will fill  
In summer it will be a swamp and all the fish will kill  
But the Government of the USA has corrected George's vow  
The father of our country must be wrong what's an Indian anyhow  
As long as the moon shall rise (look up) as long as the rivers flow (are you
thirsty)  
As long as the sun will shine (my brother are you warm) as long as the grass
shall grow

They had a warrant out for me all over the country  
And I was trying to beat the raps in Idaho  
I was breaking into a schoolhouse Sunday morning without warning  
When I saw the sheriff coming for me slow from down below  
  
His steel gray eyes were blazing when he saw me  
His hand was on his gun when he rode up  
He said you killed that woman I know you shot her why'd you do it  
I'm taking you to Austin then I'm gonna lock you up  
  
Well he tied me with a plow line the next morning  
And he had me deep in Texas the next day  
A crazy screaming lynch mob waited in the streets of Austin  
But he put me in the jailhouse and he threw the key away  
  
A jury found me guilty three months later twelve evil men with murder in their
eyes  
They even took me out and said now show us where you killed her  
And that wicked judge said now I here by sentence you to die  
But here I am far away from Austin prison my friend the jailer handed me a
file  
Now all I want between me and there are a lot of friendly people  
And miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles and miles

(Dream on, dream on teenage queen prettiest girl we've ever seen)  
There's a story in our town  
Of the prettiest girl around

Boys hung 'round her by the score  
But she loved the boy next door who worked at the candy store

He would marry her next spring  
Saved his money, bought a ring  
Then one day a movie scout  
Came to town to take her out (Came to town to take her out)  
Hollywood could offer more  
So she left the boy next door working at the candy store

Very soon she was a star  
Pretty house and shiny car  
Swimming pool and a fence around

All the world was at her door  
All except the boy next door who worked at the candy store  
(Dream on, dream on teenage queen saddest girl we've ever seen)  
  
Then one day the teenage star  
Sold her house and all her cars

Do I have to tell you more  
She came back to the boy next door who worked at the candy store  
  
(Now this story has some more, you'll hear it all at the candy store)

I asked my love to take a walk  
Take a walk just a little ways  
And as we walked, along we talk  
All would be our wedding day  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
I asked her if she'd marry me  
And my wife forever be  
She only turned her head away  
And had no other words to say  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
I plunged a knife into her breast  
And told her she was going to rest  
She cried "Oh Willy, don't murder me  
I'm not prepared for eternity"  
I took her by her golden curls  
And drug her down to the river side  
And there I threw her into drown  
And I watched her as she floated down  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  
And going home between twelve and one  
I cried "Oh Lord, what have I've done?"  
I've killed the only girl I love  
Because she would not marry me  
And only say that you'll be mine  
In no others arms entwined  
Down beside where the waters flow  
Down by the banks of the Ohio  

Well, the bible tells us about a man  
Who ruled Babylon and all its land  
Around the city, he built a wall  
And declared that Babylon would never fall  
He had concubines and wives  
He called his Babylon "Paradise"  
On his throne he drank and ate  
But for Belshazzar it was gettin' late  
  
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand  
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His houses were built upon the sand  
  
Well, the people feasted and drank their wine  
And praised the false gods of his time  
All holy things they scorned and mocked  
But suddenly all their mocking stopped  
For on the wall, there appeared a hand  
Nothin' else, there was no man  
In blood the hand began to write  
And Belshazzar couldn't hide his fright  
  
For he was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His kingdom was divided, couldn't stand  
He was weighed in the balance and found wanting  
His houses were built upon the sand  
  
Well, no one around could understand  
What was written by the mystic hand  
Belshazzar tried, but couldn't find  
A man who could give him peace of mind  
But Daniel, the prophet, a man of God  
He saw the writing on the wall in blood  
Belshazzar asked him what it said  
And Daniel turned to the wall and read:  
  
"My friend, you're weighed in the balance and found wanting  
Your kingdom is divided, it can't stand  
You're weighed in the balance and found wanting  
Your houses are built upon the sand"

Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry,  
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.  
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.  
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.  
  
I met her accidentally in St. Paul (Minnesota).  
And it tore me up every time I heard her drawl, Southern drawl.  
Then I heard my dream was back Downstream cavortin' in Davenport,  
And I followed you, Big River, when you called.  
  
Then you took me to St. Louis later on (down the river).  
A freighter said she's been here but she's gone, boy, she's gone.  
I found her trail in Memphis, but she just walked up the block.  
She raised a few eyebrows and then she went on down alone.  
  
Now, won't you batter down by Baton Rouge, River Queen, roll it on.  
Take that woman on down to New Orleans, New Orleans.  
Go on, I've had enough, dump my blues down in the gulf.  
She loves you, Big River, more than me.  
  
Now I taught the weeping willow how to cry, cry, cry  
And I showed the clouds how to cover up a clear blue sky.  
And the tears that I cried for that woman are gonna flood you Big River.  
Then I'm gonna sit right here until I die.

Like a bird on a wire  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir  
I have tried in my way to be free  
Like a fish on a hook  
Like a knight in an old fashioned book  
I have saved all my ribbons with thee  
  
And if I have been unkind  
I hope you will just let it go by  
And if I have been untrue  
I hope you know it was never to you  
  
Like a baby stillborn  
Like a beast with his horn  
I have torn everyone who reached out for me  
  
But I swear by this song  
By all I have done wrong  
I'll make it all up to you  
  
I saw a beggar leaning on his wooden crutch  
He called out to me "Don't ask for so much"  
And a young man leaning on his darkened door  
He cried out to me "Hey, why not ask for more"  
  
Like a bird on a wire  
Like a drunk in a midnight choir  
I have tried in my way to be free

I've got great big blisters on my bloodshot  
Eyes from looking at that long legged woman up ahead  
What she does simply walking down the sidewalk of the city  
Makes me think about a stray cat getting fed  
  
he's got a whole lotta motion in her sole, I know  
But her sole ain't the place she lets it show  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
Lord I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
I've got great big blisters on my fingertips  
From reaching in my pocket book and picking out the bills  
And I got tiny white blisters in my throat  
From trying to ease my nervous tension taking all them pat and pills  
  
And ever since she started running around from bar to bar  
I just can't eat a bite or keep my stomach settled down  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
She done got me, oh yeah  
She done tore my sole apart, put big blisters on my heart  
What a mighty crazy cooking way to go  
  
She got a body, oh yeah, she got a motion, oh yeah  
Oh I'm blistered, oh, oh yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh yeah  
Blistered, blistered

Born to lose, I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream has only brought me pain  
All my life, I've always been so blue  
Born to lose, and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose, it seems so hard to bear  
How I long to always have you near  
You've grown tired, and now you say we're thru  
Born to lose, and now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose, my every hope is gone  
It's so hard to face an empty dawn  
You were all the happiness I knew  
Born to lose, and now I'm losing you  
  
There's no use to dream of happiness  
All I see is only loneliness  
All my life, I've always been so blue  
Born to lose, and now I'm losing you

Pick a lot o'cotton drag a long sack comin' across the field well I see Boss
Jack  
He's a ridin' straddle of a single foot roan  
When you know that horse you'll leave him alone  
The ole roan's got green in his eyes mean as the devil and twice as wise  
  
A fire in his nose and a bow in his back can't nobody ride him but Boss Jack  
Come on children bend your back work a little faster fill your sack  
Then you hitch up the wagon take it to the gin finish pickin' before the
winter sets in  
  
Now here while back when the crop was laid by  
Remember who took us on a big fish fry  
Caught a heap of catfish goggle eye and carp  
Dashed and sang to the guitar and the harp  
  
Well someday old Boss Jack is gonna set us all free  
Gabriel gonna blow for you and me  
Angels gonna bring that chariot from above floppin' there wings like a turtle
dove  
Come on children...

Baby you're tired I can see in your eyes, I know how you feel  
We've been together too long to conceal  
What's in our hearts maybe we should part but after so many years  
That would only bring loneliness, sorrow and tears and anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us  
So let's try again, we'll start a brand new dance between old friends  
  
There will always be days when it don't seem to pay  
When it just doesn't rhyme  
Well let's bound to happen some of the time  
Our best days ain't gone, we don't need to move on  
Well maybe we could try  
But I don't think you can make it and neither could I and anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us  
So let's try again, we'll start a brand new dance between old friends  
  
Baby, come here love ain't disappeared, you're just feeling low  
And let me tell you my darling, it's a feeling I know  
It don't mean too much we just got out of touch  
Well that's easy to change  
'Cause loving you ain't too hard to arrange  
And anyway  
  
I never could, never would, never will ever kill what's between us  
So let's try again, we'll start a brand new dance between old friends

Breaking bread, breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread, breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
It's not the barley or the wheat  
It's not the oven or the heat  
That makes this bread so good to eat  
It's the needing and the sharing that makes the meal complete  
Breaking bread, breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread, breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Upon the water prayed his cast  
The last is first, the first is last  
For everyone who eats this bread  
There are thousands maybe more that will be fed  
Breaking bread, breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread, breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  
Breaking bread, breaking bread  
We are gathered here together to break bread  

Flying cross the desert in a TWA  
Saw a women walking  
Cross the sand  
They been walking thirty miles  
In route to L.A. to get  
A brown eyed handsome man  
The destination was  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass  
She had the world  
In the palm of her hand  
But she lost both her arms  
In a wrestling match to get  
A brown eyed handsome man  
She fought and won herself  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Way back in history  
Three thousand years  
Back ever since the world began  
Been a whole lot a good women  
Shedding tears for  
A brown eyed handsome man  
That's what the trouble was  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Beautiful daughter couldn't  
Make up her mind between  
A doctor and a lawyer man  
Mamma told her daughter  
Go out and find herself  
A brown eyed handsome man  
Just like your daddy is  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Arrested on charges  
Of unemployment  
He was sitting in the witness stand  
The judges wife called up  
The district attorney said you better  
Free that brown eyed man  
If you want your job you'd better  
Free that brown eyed man  
  
Way back in history  
Three thousand years  
Back when ever since the world began  
Got a whole lotta good woman  
Shedding tears for  
A brown eyed handsome man  
That's what the trouble was  
A brown eyed handsome man

'Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie  
These words came low and mournfully  
From the pallid lips of a youth who lay  
On the bloody ground at the close of day  
Oh, bury me not and his voice failed there  
But we took no heed to his dying prayer  
In a narrow grave just six by three  
We buried him there on the lone prairie  
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie  
Where the coyotes howl and the wind blows free  
Where there's not a soul that will care for me  
Oh, bury me not on the lone prairie  

A little girl woke up deep in the dark and started cryin'  
The mother brought a light and held her daughter tight  
She thought it was so strange to hear a little girl of nine  
Cry, "Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"  
Her mother wiped the tears and said, "See honey, you're only dreaming  
Your dad must work today, he has to draw his pay"  
She left her then but still could hear her cry time after time  
"Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"  
Then the countryside was shaken by a mighty rumble  
And fear for miles around was the trembling of the ground  
The little girl was fast asleep, yet cried out one more time  
"Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"  
Ten thousand tears and two weeks later deep in the smoking ground  
A dying man was found had survived all those around  
He'd quickly crawled to a fresh air pocket barely just in time  
When he heard his own child whine, "Call daddy from the mine  
Call daddy from the mine, call daddy from the mine"  

Call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
I ain't got me nobody  
I don't carry me no load  
  
Ain't no change in the weather  
Ain't no changes in me  
Well there ain't no change in the weather  
Ain't no changes in me  
And I ain't hidin from nobody  
Nobody's hidin from me  
Oh, that's the way its supposed to be  
  
Well I got that green light baby  
I got to keep movin on  
Well I got that green light baby  
I got to keep movin on  
Well I might go out to California  
Might go down to Georgia  
I don't know  
  
Well I dig you Georgia peaches  
Makes me feel right at home  
Well now I dig you Georgia peaches  
Makes me feel right at home  
But I don't love me no one woman  
So I cant stay in Georgia long  
  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
Well now they call me the breeze  
I keep blowin down the road  
I ain't got me nobody  
I don't carry me no load  
Oooh Mr Breeze

Casey joins the hollow sound  
Of silent people walking down  
The stairway to the subway  
In the shadows down below  
  
Following the footsteps  
Through the neon darkened corridors  
Of silent desperation  
Never speakin' to a soul  
  
The poisoned air he's breathin'  
Has the dirty smell of dyin'  
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine  
And it's never felt the rain  
  
But Casey minds the arrows  
And ignores the fatal echoes  
Of the clickin' of the turnstile  
And the rattle of his chain  
  
"Oh!" she said  
"Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"  
"Here" she said  
"Just a kiss to make a body smile"  
  
"See" she said  
"I've put on new stockings just to please you"  
"Lord" she said  
"Casey can you only stay a while?"  
  
Casey leaves the underground  
And stops inside the Golden Crown  
For something wet to wipe away  
The chill that's on his bones  
  
Seein' his reflection  
In the lives of all the lonely men  
Who reach for anything they can  
To keep from goin' home  
  
Standing in the corner  
Casey drinks his pint of bitter  
Never glancin' in the mirror  
At the people passin' by  
  
Then he stumbles as he's leavin'  
And he wonders if the reason  
Is the beer that's in his belly  
Or the tear that's in his eye  
  
"Oh!" she said  
"I suppose you seldom think about me"  
"Now" she said  
"Now that you've a family of your own"  
  
"Still" she said  
"It's so blessed good to feel your body"  
"Lord" she said  
"Casey it's a shame to be alone"

A child arrived just the other day  
He came to the world in the usual way  
But there were planes to catch, and bills to pay  
He learned to walk while I was away  
  
And he was talkin' 'fore I knew it and as he grew  
He said, I'm gonna be like you, Dad  
You know I'm gonna be like you  
  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home Dad?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
My son turned ten just the other day,  
He said "Thanks for the ball, Dad, come on let's play  
Can you teach me to throw?", I said  
"Not today, I got a lot to do", he said, "That's okay"  
  
And he walked away but his smile never dimmed  
He said, "I'm gonna be like him, yeah  
You know I'm gonna be like him"  
  
And the cat's in the cradle and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home, Dad?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
He came from college just the other day  
So much like a man, I just had to say  
"Son I'm proud of you, can you sit for a while?"  
He shook his head, and said with a smile  
  
"What I'd really like, Dad, is to borrow the car keys  
See ya later, can I have them please?"  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home Son?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then, Dad  
You know we'll have a good time then  
  
Now I've retired, my son's moved away  
I called him up just the other day  
I said, "I'd like to see you, if you don't mind"  
He said, "I'd love to, Dad, if I could find the time  
My new job's a hassle and the kids got the flu  
But it's nice talkin' to you Dad, it's sure nice talkin' to you"  
  
As I hung up the phone it occurred to me  
He'd grown up just like me  
My boy was just like me  
  
And the cat's in the cradle, and the silver spoon  
Little boy blue and the man on the moon  
When you comin' home, Son?  
I don't know when but we'll get together then Dad  
You gonna have a good time then

I'll sweep out your chimney  
Yes and, I will bring you flowers  
Yes and, I will do for you  
Most anything you want me to  
  
If we live in a cottage  
You will feel like it's a castle  
By the royal way you're treated  
And attention shown to you  
  
I'll be there beside you  
If you need a cryin' shoulder  
Yes, and I'll be there to listen  
When you need to talk to me  
  
When you wake up in the darkness  
I will put my arms around you  
And hold you 'til the mornin' sun  
Comes shinin' through the trees  
  
I'll be right beside you  
No matter where you travel  
I'll be there to cheer you  
'Til the sun comes shinin through  
  
If we're ever parted  
I will keep the tie that binds us  
And I'll never let it break  
'Cause I love you  
  
I will bring you honey  
From the bee tree in the meadow  
And the first time there?s a rainbow  
I'll bring you a pot of gold  
  
I'll take all your troubles  
And I'll throw 'em in the river  
Then I'll bundle down beside you  
And I'll keep you from the cold  
  
I'll be right beside you  
No matter where you travel  
I'll be there to cheer you  
Till the sun comes shinin through  
  
If we're ever parted  
I will keep the tie that binds us  
And I'll never let it break  
'Cause I love you

One day near Christmas when I was just a child  
Mama called us together and mama tried to smile  
She said you know the cotton crop hasn't been too good this year  
There's just no spending money and well at least we're all here  
I hope you won't expect a lot of Christmas presents  
Just be thankful that there is plenty to eat  
That's quite a blessing that'll make things a little more pleasant  
And us kids got to thinking how really blessed we were  
At least we were all healthy and best of all we had her  
Roy cut down a pigapple tree and we drug it home Jack and me  
Daddy killed a squirrel and Louise made the bread  
Reba decorated the tree with popcorn strings before we went to bed  
Mama and daddy sacrificed cause this Christmas was lean  
But after all there was the babies Tom and Joanne babies need a few things  
I whittled a whistle for my brother Jack and though we fought now and then  
When I gave Jack that whistle he knew I thought the world of him  
Mama made the girl's dresses out of flower sacks  
And when she ironed them down you couldn't tell that they hadn't come from
town  
A sharecropped family across the road didn't have it as good as us  
They didn't even have a light and it was way past dusk  
And mama said well I bet they don't even have coaloil or beans to boil  
A log apples cranges and such  
Me and Jack took a jar of coaloil nd some hickernuts we'd found  
We walked to the sharecropper's porch and set 'em down  
A poor old ragged lady eased open the door  
She picked up the coaloil and hickernuts and said  
I sure do thank ye and quickly closed the door  
We started back home me and Jack and about halfway we stopped looked back  
And in the sharecropper's window at last was a light  
So for one of the neighbors and for us it was a good Christmas night  
Christmas came and Christmas went Christmas that year was heaven sent  
Then daddy put on his gumboots waited for the thaw back home in Dyess Arkansas

City jail city jail like an old scared dog I tuck my tail  
Bow my head and not a careless word is said  
Gotta sleep on the floor once more at city jail  
  
Well I was hangin' round the bus station  
Mindin' my own business like I always do  
When I saw this waitress in this bus station cafe  
And I thought I check out the action like I always do  
I'd give her the bad eye and made a few choices personal comments  
About what I thought mine and her possibilities could be for a team  
When she called the badge on me  
The badge grabbed me by the arm and he said  
What are you doin' hangin' around here for  
And I said for whatever's goin' around  
City jail city jail...  
  
He said no what I mean is what are you doin'  
Sayin' things like that to that lady  
And I said what's that lady's doin' with purple hair  
Well the badge said you're smart alec and I said no I ain't I'm just hungry  
And he said you're actin' like a smart alec  
And I said no that's how I act when I get hungry  
City jail city jail...  
  
Well he put me outside in a dark corner  
And before you could say hypocrite he hit me on the head  
And I said oh don't hit me on the head  
I can't protect myself with the handcuffs on  
Please don't hit me on the head then he hit me again he hit me again he hit me
again  
And I said oh oh oh oh oh please don't stand on my feet when you hit me  
I break my ankles when I fall  
  
City jail city jail...  
  
Well about that time they threw me in the wagon  
And that waitress walked out with a sailor  
I said hey you not you I'm talkin' to the purple people eater  
Yes you lady quote you're the cause of it all unquote  
Then she said to that sailor said get me away from that horrible man Harry  
  
City jail city jail...  
Well as they hauled me away I said everybody have a nice evening

(Oh my darling Clementine)  
She knew that Cody was the man she wanted but she had waited nearly all her
life  
Just one more trip to town to tell the boys goodbye  
Then he'd be back to take her for his wife (don't you worry) Clementine  
Cody saddled up and left his darling then rode to town to celebrate his plan  
He told 'em this would be his last carousing  
  
I'm gonna settle down boys if I can (with my darling) Clementine  
Someone said it must have been past midnight when Cody had to face a jealous
man  
Another story goes that no one really knows  
But it seems there was a dancehall girl called Nan (don't you tell) Clementine  
We do know that the shot or two was heard from some back room  
Then there was a silence in the place  
  
Just one more trip to town but all his chips were down  
They found Cody lying on his face (softly calling) Clementine  
So buddies make a monument to lay down at his head  
Sure you hate to leave your pal behind  
  
Mother help your daughter put her wedding dress away  
Cause Cody won't be riding back this time (to his darling) Clementine

Early one mornin' while makin' the rounds  
I took a shot of cocaine and shot my woman down  
I went right home and I went to bed  
I stuck that lovin' forty-four beneath my head.  
  
Got up next mornin' and I grabbed that gun  
Took a shot of cocaine and away I run  
Made a good run but I run too slow  
They overtook me down in Juarez Mexico.  
  
Laid in the hot joint takin' the pill  
In walked a sheriff from Jericho Hill  
He said Willy Lee your name is not Jack Brown  
You're the dirty hack that shot your woman down.  
  
I said yes sir my name is Willie Lee  
If you've got a warrant just read it to me  
Shot her down cause she made me slow  
I thought I was her daddy but she had five more.  
  
When I was arrested I was dressed in black  
They put me on a train and they took me back  
Had no friends for to go my bail  
They slapped my dried up carcass in the county jail.  
  
Early next morning about a half past nine  
I spied a sheriff comin' down the line  
Coughed and coughed as he cleared his throat  
He said come on you dirty hack into that district court  
  
Into the court room my trial began  
Where I was handled by twelve honest men  
Just before the jury started out  
I saw that little judge commence to look about.  
  
In about five minutes in walked a man  
Holding the verdict in his right hand  
The verdict read in the first degree  
I hollered Lordy Lordy have mercy on me  
  
The judge he smiled as he picked up his pen  
Ninety nine years in the Folsom pen  
Ninety nine years underneath that ground  
I can't forget the day I shot that bad bitch down  
Come on you gotta listen unto me  
Lay off that whiskey and let that cocaine be

I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme  
Now a memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart  
  
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do  
In anger unkind words are said they make the teardrops start  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart  
  
Yeah, there was a time when I believed that you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory  
  
The more I learn to care for you the more we drift apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind and melt your cold, cold heart

One of these cold lonesome mornings, you're gonna kill me  
I'm gonna lay there and I'm gonna die  
You will soon give me pain enough to fill me  
'Cause I'm gone past doin' any good to cry  
And the warm sunshine is like a stranger  
There's a cruel violation with the dawn  
Lord, my pain can't stand illumination  
And one of these cold lonesome mornings I'll be gone  
One of these cold lonesome mornings, dark and early  
Before a wild bird sings I'm gonna fly  
While it's still dark and I'm still reachin' for you  
I'll wake up and I can't cry  
But I know my heart can't stand another tremor  
Now it's holding together I don't know  
But just before the dawning's first glimmer  
One of these cold lonesome mornings I'm gonna go  
Yes, one of these cold lonesome mornings you're gonna kill me [unverified]  

Well, it's plain to see you're givin' me a cold shoulder  
You put a chill on every thrill with a cold shoulder  
All the time I wait around to get a little squeeze  
But nothin' ever happens 'cause she just stand there and freeze  
  
It ain't polite to waste moonlight on a cold shoulder  
It isn't smart to give my heart a cold shoulder  
I need your love to warm me through and through  
But I always get a cold shoulder from you  
  
All the time I wait around to get a little squeeze  
But nothing ever happens 'cause she just stand there and freeze  
  
It ain't polite to waste moonlight on a cold shoulder  
It isn't smart to give my heart a cold shoulder  
I need your love to warm me through and through  
But I always get a cold shoulder from you

She said come in stranger  
It's good to have you home  
I hurried through 'cause I knew it was you  
When I saw your dog, waggin' his tail  
Honey, why didn't you let me know by mail  
You've been gone so long  
She said come in stranger  
  
I know you're weary from all your miles  
Just sit right there in your easy chair  
And tell me all about the places you've been  
How long it'll be before you leave again  
I hope it's a long, long while  
She said come in stranger  
  
Everything 'round home is fine  
I've watched and I've waited for you to get back  
And I missed you all the time  
She said come in, stranger  
  
Oh how I need you when you're gone  
I walk the floor and I watch the door  
And when I lie awake and wonder where you can be  
I'd give anything to have you here with me  
I get so lonesome all alone  
She said come in, stranger  
  
And won't you listen to my plea  
Stay long enough, so that the one I love  
Is not a stranger to me

And she spread her wings and she flew  
Yup, the nation was flying now  
Taken to the air, in few hours time you could fly over  
All those trails blazed by the pioneers  
  
Phonographs were playing the hit songs of the day  
Alexanders ragtime band  
My mother was a lady and here's a song my mama sing  
Back about 1910 or 1915  
  
Come take a trip in my airship  
Come take a trip round the stars  
Come take a sail around Venus  
Come take a sail around Mars  
  
No one to watch while we're kissin'  
No one to see while we spoon  
Come take a trip in my airship  
We'll visit the man in the moon

Country boy, ain't got no shoes  
Country boy, ain't got no blues  
Well, you work all day while you're waiting to play  
In the sun and the sand, with cheeks of tan  
But at the end of the day, when your work is done  
You ain't got nothing but fun  
  
Country boy, you got a shaggy dog  
Country boy, up a hollow log  
Well, he comes in a run, when you pick up your gun  
And with a shell or two, and your dog and you  
When you get your rabbit, you'll skin his hide  
He's gonna be good fried  
  
Country boy, you got a lot to lose  
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes  
  
Country boy, ain't got no ills  
Country boy, don't owe no bills  
You got a wiggly worm and then you watch him squirm  
While you put him on a hook and you drop him in a brook  
If everything's gonna turn out right, you're gonna fry fish tonight  
  
Country boy, got a lot to lose  
Country boy, how I wish I was in your shoes  
  
Country boy, you got work to do  
Country boy, in the morning dew  
You gotta plant the seed, you gotta cut the weeds  
There's many a row you know you gotta hoe  
When it's quitting time, and your work is through  
There's a lot if life in you  
  
Country boy, you lucky thing  
Country boy, I wish I was you, and you were me

I got a crib full of corn, and a turnin' plow  
But the grounds to wet for the hopper now.  
Got a cultivator and a double tree  
A leather line for the hull and gee  
Let the thunder roar and the lighting flash  
I'm doing alright for Country Trash  
  
I'm saving up dimes for a rainy day  
I got about a dollar laid away  
The winds from the south and the fishing's good  
Got a pot belly stove and a quart of wood  
Mama turns left-overs into hash  
I'm doing alright for Country Trash  
  
I got a machine and a hunting dog  
A cap I ordered from the catalog  
A good tall tree that shades the yard  
A good fat sow for the winters lard  
Let the thunder roar and the lighting flash  
I'm doing alright for Country Trash  
  
Well there's not much new ground left to plow  
And the crops need fertilizer now  
My hands don't earn too much gold  
For security when I grow old  
But we'll all be equal under the grass  
And God's got a heaven for Country Trash  
And God's got a heaven for Country Trash  
I'll be doing alright for Country Trash

I've had fame and fortune  
Women come knock on my door  
I've lived to the limit  
Maybe a little bit more  
  
There are so many stories  
About how I got out of control  
Some say it's a woman  
Some say it's my troubled soul  
  
I'm like a crazy old soldier  
Fighting a war on my own  
Just me and the whiskey  
And the bottles are ten thousand strong  
  
You'd think I'd give up  
As many times as I've been hit  
But like a crazy old soldier  
I just don't know when to quit  
  
Bar rooms and bedrooms  
Are just faces and places and names  
Once for the pleasure  
And Lord knows once for the pain  
  
I've tried to forget her  
And all of the things that we've done  
But as long as there are memories  
I'll never hang up my gun  
  
I'm like a crazy old soldier  
Fighting a war on my own  
Just me and the whiskey  
And the bottles are ten thousand strong  
  
You'd think, I'd give up  
As many times as I've been hit  
But like a crazy old soldier  
I just don't know when to quit  
  
Like a crazy old soldier  
I just don't know when to quit

Now I will tell you buster that I ain't a fan of Custer  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
To some he was a hero but to me his score was zero  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
Now Custer done his fightin' without too much excitin'  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
General Custer come in pumpin' when the men were out a huntin'  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
With victories he was swimmin' he killed children dogs and women  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
Crazy Horse sent out the call to Sitting Bull and Gall  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
Now Custer split his men well he won't do that again  
Cause the General he don't ride well anymore  
Twelve thousand warriors waited they were unanticipated  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
It's not called an Indian victory but a bloody massacre  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
There might have been more enthusin' if us Indians had been losin'  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
General George A.Custer oh his yellow hair had lustre  
But the General he don't ride well anymore  
For now the General's silent he got barbered violent  
And the General he don't ride well anymore  
Oh the General he don't ride well anymore

I remember when I was a lad  
Times were hard and things were bad  
But there's a silver linin' behind ev'ry cloud  
Just four people that 's all we were  
Tryin' to make a livin' out of black-land dirt  
But we'd get together in a family circle singin' loud  
  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
Singin' seems to help a troubled soul  
One of these days and it won't be long  
I'll rejoin them in a song  
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne  
  
Though the circle won't be broken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
Now I remember after work mama would call in all of us  
You could hear us singin' for a country mile  
Now little brother has done gone on  
But I'll rejoin him in a song  
We'll be together again up yonder in a little while  
  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
'Cause singin' seems to help a troubled soul  
One of these days and it won't be long  
I'll rejoin them in a song  
I'm gonna join the family circle at the throne  
  
Oh no the circle won't be broken  
By and by, Lord, by and by  
Daddy sang bass (mama sang tenor)  
Me and little brother would join right in there  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky  
  
In the sky, Lord, in the sky

Oh Danny Boy, the pipes, the pipes are calling.  
From glen to glen and down the mountain side.  
The summer's gone, and all the roses falling.  
It's you, It's you, must go, and I must bide.  
  
But come ye back when summer's in the meadow.  
Or when the valley's hushed and white with snow.  
I'll be here in sunshine or in shadow  
Oh Danny Boy, oh Danny Boy, I love you so.  
  
But if you come, and all the flowers are dying,  
And I am dead, as dead I well may be.  
You'll come and find the place where I am lying.  
And kneel and say an "Ave" there for me.  
  
And I will know, tho' soft ye tread above me  
And then my grave will richer, sweeter be.  
And you'll bend down and tell me that you love me  
And I will rest in peace until you come to me.

Oh come all you young fellers so young and so fine  
Seek not your fortune in a dark dreary mine  
It'll form as a habit and seep in your soul  
Till the stream of your blood runs as black as the coal  
Where it's dark as a dungeon damp as the dew danger is double pleasures are
few  
Where the rain never falls the sun never shines  
It's a dark as a dungeon way down in the mine  
  
Well it's many a man that I've seen in my day  
(uh huh no laughing during this song please it's being recorded)  
Like a fiend with his dope and a drunkard with his wine  
A man will have lust for the lure of the mine  
And pray when I'm dead and my ages shall roll  
That my body would blacken and turn into coal  
Then I'll look from the door of my heavenly home and pity the miner digging my
bones  
Where it's dark as a dungeon

Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'.  
And let me be your champion: a hand to hold your pretty hand in.  
Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned.  
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you.  
  
Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed.  
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need.  
  
Darlin' companion, now you know you'll never be abandoned.  
Love will always light our landin': I can depend on you.  
  
Darlin' companion, come on and give me understandin'.  
As long as we keep laughin', bear in mind just what could happen.  
Darlin' companion, I tell the mountains and the canyons,  
Long as I got legs to stand on, I'm gonna stick by you.  
  
Oh, a little saucy mare like you should have a steed.  
Oh, a little bridlin' down from you is what I need.

Delia, oh. Delia  
Delia all my life  
If I hadn't shot poor Delia  
I'd have had her for my wife  
Delia's gone, one more round  
Delia's gone  
  
I went up to Memphis  
And I met Delia there  
Found her in her parlor  
And I tied to her chair  
Delia's gone, one more round  
Delia's gone  
  
She was low and trifling  
And she was cold and mean  
Kind of evil make me want to  
Grab my sub machine  
Delia's gone, one more round  
Delia's gone  
  
First time I shot her  
I shot her in the side  
Hard to watch her suffer  
But with the second shot she died  
Delia's gone, one more round  
Delia's gone  
  
But jailer, oh, jailer  
Jailer, I can't sleep  
'Cause all around my bedside  
I hear the patter of Delia's feet  
Delia's gone, one more round  
Delia's gone  
  
So if your woman's devilish  
You can let her run  
Or you can bring her down and do her  
Like Delia got done  
Delia's gone, one more round  
Delia's gone

It's been ten long years since  
The devil laid his fiddle at Johnny's feet  
And it burned inside his mind  
The way he suffered that defeat  
  
In the darkest pits of hell  
The devil hatched an evil plan  
To tempt the fiddle player for  
He's just a mortal man  
  
"The sin of pride," the devil  
Cried is what will do you in  
"I thought we had this settled,  
I'm the best there's ever been"  
  
Johnny did you ever know  
That time keeps marching on?  
The coldest hour is the one  
Comes just before the dawn  
  
The devil's back in Georgia  
Will you stand up to the test  
Or will you let the  
Devil be the best?  
  
In truth, I haven't played much  
Since the baby came in June  
But give me half a minute an'  
I'll get this fiddle back in tune  
  
The devil grabbed the golden  
Fiddle out of Johnny's hand and said  
"Though I'm the fiddle player  
Underground and I walk upon the land"  
  
Y'all just better be just turnin'  
Back if you want this boy to win  
'Cos practice is the only cure for  
The predicament he's in  
  
Now devil it would be a sin  
For you to get my bow  
You go on back to hell and to  
The wood shed I will go  
  
Johnny are you practicing or  
Will your hands grow cold?  
The devil walks the land and  
Plays a fiddle made of gold  
  
Can you hear the babe a crying  
Will he ever know?  
The devil wants  
His daddy's very soul?  
  
Before we play, I want to thank you  
For letting God's own Word ring true  
He said, "You can't be trusted  
Yes but what you gonna do?"  
  
Well you get your fiddle devil if  
You think that you can win  
'Cos I beat you once you old dog  
And I can whip your butt again  
  
John Brown's green, the devil is red  
Mama's little baby loves short-nymph bread  
The devil's dream is that he can win  
But Johnny is the best that's ever been

Well he's not very handsome to look at  
Oh he's shaggy and he eats like a hog  
And he's always killin' my chickens  
That dirty old egg-suckin' dog  
  
Egg-suckin' dog  
I'm gonna stomp your head in the ground  
If you don't stay out of my hen house  
You dirty old egg-suckin' hound  
  
Now if he don't stop eatin' my eggs up  
Though I'm not a real bad guy  
I'm gonna get my riffle and send him  
To that great chicken house in the sky  
  
Egg-suckin' dog  
Your always hangin' around  
But you'd better stay out of my hen house  
You dirty old egg-suckin' hound

You take my hand and smile at me  
But I can tell you'd rather be  
Alone or with somebody else you know  
And when your eyes are looking to mine  
That old time love light doesn't shine  
But let me try again don't make me go  
  
I want you don't make me go my heart would break  
I'd miss you so  
Treatin' love for sympathy is all to me  
What's this lovesick heart to do when it cries for only you  
Hold me close I love you so don't make me go  
  
I'm sorry that I never knew the way to show my love for you  
I took too much for granted all the time  
Two hearts in love must give and take  
When one heart feels the other breaks  
Don't make me go I wanna show this love of mine  
  
I want you don't make me go

A young cowboy named Billy Joe grew restless on the farm  
A boy filled with wonderlust who really meant no harm  
He changed his clothes and shined his boots  
And combed his dark hair down  
And his mother cried as he walked out  
  
Don't take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Don't take your guns to town  
  
He laughed and kissed his mom  
And said your Billy Joe's a man  
I can shoot as quick and straight as anybody can  
But I wouldn't shoot without a cause  
I'd gun nobody down  
But she cried again as he rode away  
  
Don't take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Don't take your guns to town  
  
He sang a song as on he rode  
His guns hung at his hips  
He rode into a cattle town  
A smile upon his lips  
He stopped and walked into a bar  
And laid his money down  
But his mother's words echoed again  
  
Don't take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Don't take your guns to town  
  
He drank his first strong liquor then to calm his shaking hand  
And tried to tell himself he had at last he had become a man  
A dusty cowpoke at his side began to laugh him down  
And he heard again his mothers words  
  
Don't take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Don't take your guns to town  
  
Filled with rage then  
Billy Joe reached for his gun to draw  
But the stranger drew his gun and fired  
Before he even saw  
As Billy Joe fell to the floor  
The crowd all gathered 'round  
And wondered at his final words  
  
Don't take your guns to town son  
Leave your guns at home Bill  
Don't take your guns to town

It ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
It don't matter, anyhow  
An' it ain't no use to sit and wonder why, babe  
If you don't know by now  
When your rooster crows at the break of dawn  
Look out your window and I'll be gone  
You're the reason I'm travelin' on  
Don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
That light I never knowed  
An' it ain't no use in turnin' on your light, babe  
I'm on the dark side of the road  
Still I wish there was somethin' you would do or say  
To try and make me change my mind and stay  
We never did too much talkin' anyway  
So don't think twice, it's all right  
  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
Like you never did before  
It ain't no use in callin' out my name, gal  
I can't hear you any more  
I'm a-thinkin' and a-wonderin' all the way down the road  
I once loved a woman, a child I'm told  
I give her my heart but she wanted my soul  
But don't think twice, it's all right  
  
I'm walkin' down that long, lonesome road, babe  
Where I'm bound, I can't tell  
But goodbye's too good a word, gal  
So I'll just say fare thee well  
I ain't sayin' you treated me unkind  
You could have done better but I don't mind  
You just kinda wasted my precious time  
But don't think twice, it's all right

[Chorus: ]  
Do Lord, O, Do Lord, O do remember me,  
Do Lord, O, Do Lord, O do remember me,  
Do Lord, O, Do Lord, O do remember me,  
Way beyond the blue.  
  
I've got a home in glory land that out-shines the sun.  
I've got a home in glory land that out-shines the sun.  
I've got a home in glory land that out-shines the sun.  
Way beyond the blue.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too.  
I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too.  
I took Jesus as my Savior, You take Him too.  
Way beyond the blue.  
  
[Chorus]

As I walked by the lake one day by chance my Dorraine passed my way  
Then she and I walked hand in hand on the banks of Ponchartrain  
I pinned a flower on her heart, I swore we'd never be apart  
She vowed her love forever and as I kissed her did the same  
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel  
My belle of Ponchartrain  
We sat down on the dock and with our hearts and fingers locked  
We laughed and talked and joked about when our names are the same  
And joking I said honey are you marrying me for money  
And it took just one quick look to tell it hurt my dear Dorraine  
She jumped and stood above me and she cried why you don't love me  
I'm rowing home across the lake you won't see me again  
I called and called some more but she rowed fast from the shore  
And the clouds brought by a wind began to rain on Ponchartrain  
Dorraine, I called Dorraine  
Come back my little angel my belle of Ponchartrain  
The storm should make her learn that she should make a swift return  
But as the rain fell harder I lost sight of my Dorraine  
As panic gripped my heart I drew the oars and made my start  
To look for her on raging waters and the rain on Ponchartrain  
At darkness I still called but no one heard my cries at all  
And when the daybreak came then others helped me look for my Dorraine  
But there was not a thing afloat except the oars from her rowboat  
For all was lost upon the choppy waves and rain on Ponchartrain  
Now I come day after day to where my sweetheart rowed away  
And I gaze across the water of the rainy Ponchartrain  
Just one thing and nothing more ever floated back to shore  
Was this flower I hold it is the one I pinned on my Dorraine  
Dorraine, my Dorraine, my dark haired little angel  
My belle of Ponchartrain  

Well you can't be my lovin' baby  
You ain't gotta style  
I'm gonna get some real good love  
Gonna drive those cool cats wild  
  
I'm gonna move, move on down the line  
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Oh I'm gonna show you a-way so hot  
I'm gonna get what you ain't got  
She'll be cool, she'll be wrong  
She'll be cool and twice as strong  
  
Gonna roll roll on down the line  
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Why! come on now  
  
Yeah, Move on down the line  
Wanna get some love that's truly fine  
She'll be cool, she'll be long  
She'll be cool and twice as strong  
  
Gonna roll, roll on down the line  
Gonna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Oh let's sing it again one time now  
  
Yeah, move on down the line  
Wanna get some love that's truly fine  
She'll be cool, she'll be long  
She'll be cool and twice as strong  
  
Gonna roll, roll on down the line  
Wanna get some love, a love that's truly fine  
  
Yeah, move (Yeah gonna move)  
I'm gonna move (Yeah gonna move)  
I'm gonna move (Yeah gonna move)

There's a boy across the street lately he's looked very neat  
Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301  
(Seems he's always on the run down the street to 301)  
  
Saturday he mows the lawn it's about a crack of dawn  
Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301  
(Nine o'clock the work's all done down the street to 301)  
  
When it's back to school this fall, weather's chill may end it all  
But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301  
(But for now there's lots of fun with the girl at 301)  
  
Maybe they will never wed sure they may break up instead  
But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301  
(But for now she is the one the girl who lives at 301)  
  
The boy who lives across the street has a reason to be neat  
He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301  
(He's in love and on the run with the girl at 301)  
  
Don't you tell 'em to beware of a summer love affair  
You know she is only one the girl that live at 301  
(You know she is only one the girl that live at 301)

(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)  
A rose a carnation the lily and an orchid make such a pretty bouquet  
But only the orchid was worthy of you so I threw all the others away  
Then you took the orchid and you breathed on its petals and after a day or two  
The flower still blooms but it scents not the orchids it carries the savor of
you  
(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)  
  
So if you're gonna drink to me drink with your eyes and I'll never cry for
wine  
Or leave a kiss in an empty coffee cup then pass it from your lips to mine  
Cause I've got a thirst burning way down in my soul and honey from a sugar
tree  
Is not half as sweet as the air that you breathe  
Honey come here and drink to me drink to me drink to me  
(Drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me drink to me)

From the Indian reservation to the governmental school  
Well they're goin' to educate me to the white men's Golden Rule  
And I'm learning very quickly for I've learned to be ashamed  
And I come when they call Billy though I've got an Indian name  
And there are drums beyond the mountain Indian drums that you can't hear  
There are drums beyond the mountain and they're getting mighty near  
And when they think that they'd changed me cut my hair to meet their needs  
Will they think I'm white or Indian quarter blood or just half breed  
Let me tell you Mr teacher when you say you'll make me right  
In five hundred years of fighting not one Indian turned white  
And there are drums...  
Well you thought that I knew nothing when you brought me here to school  
Just another empty Indian just America's first fool  
But now I can tell you stories that are burnt and dried and old  
But in the shadow of their telling walks the thunder proud and bold  
And there are drums...  
Long Pine and Sequoia Handsome Lake and Sitting Bull  
There's Magnus Colorado with his sleeves so red and full  
Crazy Horse the legend those who bit off Custer's soul  
They are dead yet they are living with the great Geronimo  
And there are drums...  
Well you may teach me this land's hist'ry but we taught it to you first  
We broke your hearts and bent your journeys broken treaties left us cursed  
Even now you have to cheat us even though you this us tame  
In our losing we found proudness in your winning you found shame  
And there are drums...  
  

Along came the F-15 the swiftest on the line  
Running over the C and O road just twenty minutes behind  
Running into Cevile head porters on the line  
Receiving their strict orders from a station just behind  
  
Georgie's mother came to him with a bucket on her arm  
Saying my darling son be careful how you run  
Many a man has lost his life by trying to make lost time  
But if you run your engine right you'll get there just on time  
  
Up the road he darted against the rocks he crushed  
Upside down the engine turned and Georgie's breast did smash  
His head was against the firebox door the flames were rolling high  
I'm glad I was born to be an engineer on the C and O road to die  
  
The doctor said to Georgie my darling son be still  
Your life may yet be saved if it is God's blessed will  
Oh no said George that will not do I want to die so free  
I want to die for the engine I love one hundred and forty three  
  
The doctor said to Georgie your life cannot be saved  
Murdered upon a railroad and laid in a lonesome grave  
His face was covered up with blood his eyes you could not see  
The very last words poor Georgie said was nearer my God to thee

Well, the farmer prayed for a better year  
And the crops were good like the Lord did hear  
But his barn burned down with winter near  
The answer came in white and black  
In the farmer's almanac, it says  
'If a man could have half his wishes he could double his trouble'  
  
A sweet old lady was eighty-four  
When her kinfolks came for a month or more  
Now from overwork she's on the other shore  
Much too late was y'all come back  
And it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'Visitors and fish smell after three days'  
  
Our leader was a silver tongued man  
He deceived the people of the land  
And when he got caught he couldn't stand  
It's a little off-beat and a little off-track  
But it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'In rivers and bad government the lightest things flow to the top'  
  
Rod said, "I don't believe in God"  
Rod died and lies beneath the sod  
For God did not believe in Rod  
Life is a troubled and a weary track  
But it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'Feed your faith and your doubts will starve to death'  
  
The little boy followed the honeybee  
And it flew straight to the honey tree  
He got stung but got the honey free  
Consolation for the things you lack  
Is in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'God gives us the darkness so we can see the stars'  
  
He came home three hours late from work  
Said, "I had a flat and fell in the dirt"  
She said, "You gotten lipstick on your shirt"  
Well it turned out like Jill and Jack  
And it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'Lies have to be covered up, truth can run around naked'  
  
He said, "Honey, you know I'm true  
I just look at other women that's all I do"  
Then she caught him with her best friend Peggy Sue  
Sometimes some women will look back  
And it says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'There's a lot of difference in window shoppin' and shop liftin''  
  
I sat down at a shoeshine stand  
I had a real slow shoeshine man  
I said you don't pop that rag like some of 'em can  
He looked at me and then he sat right back  
It says in the farmer's almanac, it says  
'The trouble with the world today is  
There's too much poppin' and not enough shinin''

It's not time to make a change, just relax, and take it easy  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to know  
Find a girl, settle down, if you want, you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy  
To be calm when you've found something going on  
But take your time, think a lot  
Why, think of, everything you've got  
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not  
  
How can I try to explain, when I do, he turns away again  
It's always been the same, the same old story  
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go  
  
It's not time to make a change, just sit down, and take it slowly  
You're still young, that's your fault  
There's so much you have to go through  
Find a girl, settle down, if you want you can marry  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy  
  
All the times that I cried, keepin' all the things I knew inside  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it  
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them you know not me  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away  
I know I have to go

Field of diamonds in the sky, worlds are whirling right on by.  
Are you wondering who am I? Fields of diamonds in the sky.  
Am I just a star in some crown?  
Or someone's life sun going down, down, down?  
Field of diamonds in the sky, silent beauty shining high.  
Are you tears the angels cry? Field of diamonds in the sky  
  
Field of diamonds in the sky, like the night you pass me by.  
I could touch you if I tried, fields of diamonds in the sky.  
Am I just a star in some crown?  
Or someone's life sun going down, down, down?  
  
Field of diamonds in the sky, silent beauty shining high.  
Are you tears the angels cry? Field of diamonds in the sky.

The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the dark and the endless sky my love  
  
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth move through my hands  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command  
  
And the first time ever I lay with you  
I felt your heart so close to mine  
And I know our joy would fill the earth  
And last 'till the end of time my love  
  
The first time ever I saw your face

I keep hearin' your concern about my happiness  
All that thought you've given me is conscience I guess  
If I were walkin' in your shoes, I wouldn't worry none  
While you and your friends are worryin' 'bout me  
I'm havin' lots of fun  
  
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all  
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one  
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo  
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do  
  
Last night I dressed in tails, pretended I was on the town  
As long as I can dream it's hard to slow this swinger down  
So please don't give a thought to me, I'm really doin' fine  
You can always find me here and havin' quite a time  
  
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all  
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one  
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo  
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do  
  
It's good to see you, I must go, I know I look a fright  
Anyway, my eyes are not accustomed to this light  
And my shoes are not accustomed to this hard concrete  
So I must go back to my room and make my day complete  
  
Countin' flowers on the wall, that don't bother me at all  
Playin' solitaire 'til dawn with a deck of fifty one  
Smokin' cigarettes and watchin' Captain Kangaroo  
Now don't tell me, I've nothin' to do  
Don't tell me, I've nothin' to do

From the backdoor of your life you swept me out dear  
In the bread line of your dreams I lost my place  
At the table of your love I got the brush off  
At the Indianapolis of your heart I lost the race  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been washed down the sink of your conscience  
In the theater of your love I lost my part  
And now you say you've got me out of your conscience  
I've been flushed from the bathroom of your heart  
  
In the garbage disposal of you dreams I've been ground up dear  
On the river of your plans I'm up the creek  
Up the elevator of your future I've been shafted  
On the calendar of your events I'm last week  
  
[Chorus]

I will drink the cup  
The poison overflowing  
I will lift you up  
Watch over where youre going  
The first one in  
The last one gone  
I'll be the rock  
To stand upon  
For you, for you  
  
My spirit aches  
And I cant stop this river flowing  
In fear I take  
Each labored breath I draw in knowing  
That this could be my life  
My final hour  
But faith and hope and love  
Give me the power  
For you, for you  
  
Yay though I walk through the valley  
of the shadow of death  
I will fear no evil  
for you are with me  
you are with me  
  
Ill be your salvation  
Though the storm surrounding  
There are no conditions  
Lay my body down  
In the wake abandon  
Willing sacrifice  
Ill walk through the canyon  
Bring the shadows light  
For you, for you  
  
I will drink the cup  
The poison overflowing  
I will lift you up  
Watch over where youre going  
The first one in  
The last one gone  
Ill be the rock to stand upon  
The first one in  
The last one gone  
Ill be the rock to stand upon  
For you  
For you  
For you  
For you

I close my eyes and picture the emerald of the sea  
From the fishing boats at Dingle to the shores of Dunardee  
I miss the river Shannon and the folks at Skibbereen  
The moorlands and the midlands with their forty shades of green  
  
But most of all I miss a girl in Tipperary town  
And most of all I miss her lips as soft as eiderdown  
Again I want to see and do the things we've done and seen  
Where the breeze is sweet as Shalimar and there's forty shades of green  
  
(Green green green forty shades of green)  
I wish that I could spend an hour at Dublin's churching surf  
I'd love to watch the farmers drain the bogs and spade the turf  
To see again the thatching of the straw the women glean  
  
I'd walk from Cork to Larne to see the forty shades of green  
But most of all I miss a girl...

[Chorus]  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change, come what may  
But our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way  
  
Guess I'll go down to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall  
Got some friends that I can go to workin' for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I get there before the snow flies, and if things are looking good  
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter, not enough for you to do  
And those winds sure do blow cold way up there  
  
[Chorus]

Well now Frankie and Johnny were sweethearts  
They were true as a blue blue sky  
He was a long-legged guitar picker with a wicked wanderin' eye  
But he was her man nearly all of the time  
Well Johnny he packed up to leave her but he promised he'd be back  
He said he had a little pickin' to do a little farther down the track  
He said "I'm your man I wouldn't do you wrong"  
Well Frankie curled up on the sofa thinkin' about her man  
Far away the couples were dancing to the music of his band  
He was Frankie's man he wasn't doin' her wrong  
Then in the front door walked a redhead Johnny saw her right away  
She came down by the bandstand to watch him while he played  
He was Frankie's man but she was far away  
He sang every song to the redhead she smiled back at him  
Then he came and sat at her table where the lights were low and dim  
What Frankie didn't know wouldn't hurt her none  
Then the redhead jumped up and slapped him  
She slapped him a time or two  
She said "I'm Frankie's sister and I was checking up on you"  
If you're her man you better treat her right  
Well the moral of this story is be good but carry a stick  
Sometimes it looks like a guitar picker just can't tell what to pick  
He was Frankie's man and he still ain't done her wrong  

The beautiful spacious skies, the amber waves of grain  
To the majestic purple mountains above the fruited plain  
God did shed His grace from sea to shining sea on you and on me  
From Sleepy Hollow mountain country to the swamps of Okefenokee  
To Guthrie Oklahoma, to Hibbing Minnesota  
To Grants Pass Oregon, to Stone Pipe Wells, California  
From Texas to Montana, from California to Maine  
In the sunny days the winter snow from Arizona sand  
To Cherokee North Carolina, to Tarpen Springs Florida  
America, it's time to be refreshed, recalled to memory  
God did shed His grace on Thee from sea to shining sea  
The land is big the best is free  
Sand and surf grass and tree from sea to shining sea  
God shed His grace on me  
And crown Thy good with brotherhood from sea to shining sea  

Well, hello there  
  
My, it's been a long, long, long time  
How am I doin'? Oh, I guess that I'm doin' fine  
It's been so long now but it seems now  
That it was only yesterday  
  
G, ain't it funny how time slips away  
  
And how's your new love, well, I hope that he's doin' fine  
And I heard you told him that you'd love him til' the end of time  
Now that's the same thing that you told me  
And it seems like only yesterday  
  
G, ain't it funny how time just slips away  
  
Oh, I've got to go now, thank you, and I guess I'll see you around  
But I don't know when though  
'Cause I never know when I'll be back in town  
But remember what I tell you that in time you're gonna pay  
  
And it's surprising how time just slips away  
G, ain't it funny how time just slips away

Where the road is dark and the seed is sowed  
Where the gun is cocked and the bullet's cold  
Where the miles are marked in the blood and gold  
I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Got on my dead man's suit and my smilin' skull ring  
My lucky graveyard boots and song to sing  
I got a song to sing, keep me out of the cold  
And I'll meet you further on up the road.  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Where the way dark and the night is cold  
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road.  
  
Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time  
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign  
If there's a light up ahead well brother I don't know  
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul  
So let's take the good times as they go  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road [Repeat: x4]  
  
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road.

If you ever go across the sea to Ireland  
Then maybe at the closing of your day  
You will sit and watch the moon rise over Claddagh  
Or watch the sun go down on Galway Bay  
  
For the breezes blowing o'er the sea to Ireland  
Are perfumed by the heather as they blow  
And the women in the uplands diggin' praties  
Speak a language that the strangers do not know  
  
For the strangers came and tried to teach their way  
And scorned us just for being what we are  
But they might as well go chasing after moonbeams  
Or light a penny candle from a star  
  
And if there is going to be a life hereafter  
And somehow I am sure there's going to be  
I will ask my God to let me make my heaven  
In that dear land across the Irish sea

Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones  
Put taps on your toes and get goin'  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.  
  
Little shoeshine boy never get slowed down  
But he's got the dirtiest job in town  
Bendin' low at the peoples' feet  
On the windy corner of a dirty street  
Well, I asked him while he shined my shoes  
How'd he keep from gettin' the blues  
He grinned as he raised his little head  
Popped a shoeshine rag and then he said.  
  
Hey, get rhythm when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
A jumpy rhythm makes you feel so fine  
It'll shake all the troubles from your worried mind,  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.  
  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
Get a rock 'n roll feeling in your bones  
Put taps on your toes and get goin'  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues.  
  
Well, I sat down to listen to the shoeshine boy  
And I thought I was gonna jump with joy  
Slapped on the shoe polish left and right  
He took a shoeshine rag and he held it tight  
He stopped once to wipe the sweat away  
I said you're a mighty little boy to be-a workin' that way  
He said I like it with a big wide grin  
Kept on a poppin' and he said again  
  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues  
C'mon get rhythm, when you get the blues  
It only cost a dime, just a nickel a shoe  
It does a million dollars worth of good for you  
Get rhythm, when you get the blues

An old cowboy went ridin out one dark and windy day  
upon a ridge he rested as he went along his way  
when all at once a mighty herd of red-eyed cows he saw  
plowin through the ragid skies and up a cloudy draw  
  
Their brands were still on fire and their hooves were made of steel  
their horns were black and shiny and their hot breath he could feel  
a bolt of fear went through him as they thundered through the sky  
for he saw the riders comin hard and he heard their mournful cries  
  
chorus:  
yippie i ohhh ohh ohh  
yippie i aye ye ye  
ghost riders in the sky  
  
Their faces gaunt, their eyes were blurred  
their shirts all soaked with sweat  
he's ridin hard to catch that herd  
but he ain't caught em yet  
cause they got to ride forever in that range up in the sky  
on horses snortin fire as they ride on hear their cries  
  
As the riders loped on by him he heard one call his name  
''if you want to save your soul from hell a-ridin on our range  
then cowboy change your ways today or with us you will ride  
tryin to catch the devil's herd across these endless skies  
  
yippie i ohhh oh oh  
yippie i aye ye ye  
ghost riders in the sky  
ghost riders in the sky  
ghost riders in the sky  

The girl from the canyon smiled a smile that brought me home  
As sick and bleeding as I was she took me on her own  
Brought me to the canyon where the sun poured down like rain  
Her smiling eyes and the mountain light I thought myself insane  
These hills have seen me runnin' till my horse could hardly stand  
Hidin' by day in the mountains movin' with the moon on the land  
I'm hoping to find my freedom in a world that wants me dead  
The girl from the canyon took and healed my wounds instead  
The girl from the canyon she don't need to know what I had done  
She laughed with me in the moonlight till the morning brought the sun  
The girl from the canyon the girl from the canyon she was the only one  
An outlaw is a hunted one with aprice upon his head  
We're all outlaws in a way that is what she said  
And so I left the canyon when I was strong enough to ride  
The girl from the canyon she was riding by my side  
The girl from the canyon  
  
She was the only one

Well, if you're travelin' in the north country fair,  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,  
Remember me to one who lives there.  
She once was a true love of mine.  
  
Well, if you go when the snowflakes storm,  
When the rivers freeze and summer ends,  
Please see if she's wearing a coat so warm,  
To keep her from the howlin' winds.  
  
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,  
If it rolls and flows all down her breast.  
Please see for me if her hair hangs long,  
That's the way I remember her best.  
  
I'm a-wonderin' if she remembers me at all.  
Many times I've often prayed  
In the darkness of my night,  
In the brightness of my day.  
  
So if you're travelin' in the north country fair,  
Where the winds hit heavy on the borderline,  
Remember me to one who lives there.  
She once was a true love of mine.

If you're travelin'  
To the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy  
On the borderline  
  
Remember me  
To one who lives there  
For she once was  
A true love of mine  
  
See for me  
That her hair's hangin' down  
It curls and falls  
All down her breast  
  
See for me  
That her hair's hangin' down  
That's the way  
I remember her best  
  
If you go  
When the snowflakes fall  
When the rivers freeze  
And summer ends  
  
Please, see for me  
If she's having a coat so warm  
To keep her from  
The howlin' winds  
  
If you're travelin'  
To the north country fair  
Where the winds hit heavy  
On the borderline  
  
Please, say hello  
To the one who lives there  
For she once was  
A true love of mine  
  
If you're travelin'  
In the north country fair  
Where the winds  
Hit heavy on the borderline  
  
Remember me  
To one who lives there  
She once was  
A true love of mine  
  
True love of mine  
A true love of mine  
True love of mine  
True love of mine  
  
True love of mine  
A true love of mine  
She once was  
A true love of mine

I left a little town  
A little south of Hudson Bay  
I couldn't find a thing, to make a rounder want to stay  
I fought the wind across the barren waste in the crystal doom  
Going for to marry the girl in Saskatoon  
  
I'm glad I realized that no one could take her place  
My heart was beating for her like the winter beat my face  
But knowing that I'd see her made my spirit bright as June  
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon  
  
South and West and following the cold December sun  
I bedded down in the Carragana when my daily trek was done  
Then up and pressing onward by the light of the morning moon  
A prodigal returning to the girl in Saskatoon  
  
Then I found the trail that had packed beneath the snow  
I made the final miles where the prairie lilies grow  
The steeple on a church glistened by the prairie moon  
I'm freezing but I'm burning for the girl in Saskatoon  
  
My journey was forgotten  
When I held her in my arms  
My wanderlust was stifled  
By possession of her charms  
And even beneath the steeple  
Where we couldn't wait till June  
I found eternal spring with the girl in Saskatoon

When Robert E Lee surrendered the Confederacy Jefferson Davis was upset about
it  
He said how dare that man resent an order  
Form the president of the Confederate States of America  
Then somebody told him that General Lee had made the decision himself  
In order to save lives because he felt that the battle comin' up  
Would cost about twenty thousand lives on both sides  
And he said two hundred and forty thousand dead already is enough  
So this song is not about the North or the South but about the bloody brother
war  
Brother against brother father against son the war that nobody won  
And for all those lives that were saved I gotta say god bless Robert E Lee  
Well the mansion where the General used to live is burning down  
Cotton fields are blue with Sherman's troupes  
I overheard a Yankee say yesterday Nashville fell  
So I'm on my way to join the fight General Lee might need my help  
But look away look away Dixie I don't want them to see  
What they're doing to my Dixie God bless Robert E Lee  
Sherman's troupes burned Atlanta and the flames lit up the sky  
And those of us who survived it are watchin' my Dixie die  
But today at Appamattox General Lee sat down  
And surrender to the Yankees and Ulysees S Grant  
So look away look away Dixie...  
I won't ever stop loving you my Dixie till they put me in the ground  
And the last words they probably hear from me are God bless Robert E Lee

(God has my fortune laid away)  
Oh the world is full of people with money just to burn  
Affording all the things in life for which a man might yearn  
Some can take life easy but I live from day by day  
God has my fortune laid away  
  
I search for sunshine every day but there always comes the rain  
The hope over my horizon was smoke without a flame  
Pockets that stay empty dreams that go astray  
God has my fortune laid away  
  
(God has my fortune laid away laid away)  
Oh how often I have wondered why some things have to be  
Some people live in riches while some live just like me  
The more I try to work and save the more I have to pay  
But God has my fortune laid away (laid away)  
I search for sunshine

You can run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Sooner or later God'll cut you down  
Sooner or later God'll cut you down  
  
Go tell that long tongue liar  
Go and tell that midnight rider  
Tell the rambler,  
The gambler,  
The back biter  
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down  
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down  
  
Well my goodness gracious let me tell you the news  
My head's been wet with the midnight dew  
I've been down on bended knee talkin' to the man from Galilee  
He spoke to me in the voice so sweet  
I thought I heard the shuffle of the angel's feet  
He called my name and my heart stood still  
When he said, "John go do My will!"  
  
Go tell that long tongue liar  
Go and tell that midnight rider  
Tell the rambler,  
The gambler,  
The back biter  
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down  
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down  
  
You can run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Sooner or later God'll cut you down  
Sooner or later God'll cut you down  
  
Well you may throw your rock and hide your hand  
Workin' in the dark against your fellow man  
But as sure as God made black and white  
What's done in the dark will be brought to the light  
  
You can run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Run on for a long time  
Sooner or later God'll cut you down  
Sooner or later God'll cut you down  
  
Go tell that long tongue liar  
Go and tell that midnight rider  
Tell the rambler,  
The gambler,  
The back biter  
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down  
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut 'em down  
  
Tell 'em that God's gonna cut you down

The old home town looks the same,  
As I step down from the train,  
And there to meet me is my mama and my papa.  
Down the road I look, and there comes Mary,  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
The old house is still standing,  
Though the paint is cracked and dry,  
And there's the old oak tree that I used to play on.  
Down the lane I walk with my sweet Mary,  
Hair of gold and lips like cherries.  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me,  
Arms reaching, smiling sweetly.  
It's good to touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Then I awake and look around me,  
At the four gray walls that surround me,  
And I realize that I was only dreaming.  
For there's a guard, and there's a sad old padre,  
Arm in arm, we'll walk at daybreak.  
Again, I'll touch the green, green grass of home.  
  
Yes, they'll all come to see me  
In the shade of the old oak tree,  
As they lay me 'neath the green, green grass of home.

I used to have a sweetheart but now I've got none  
Since she's gone and left me, I care not for one  
Since she's gone and left me, contended I'll be  
For she loves another one better than me  
  
Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you  
I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you  
And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true  
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue  
  
I passed my love's window both early and late  
The look that she gave me, made my heart ache  
The look that she gave me was harm for to see  
For she loves another one better than me  
  
Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you  
I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you  
And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true  
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue  
  
I wrote my love a letter in rosy red lines  
She sent me an answer all twisted and twine  
Saying keep your love letters and I will keep mine  
Write to your sweetheart and I'll write to mine  
  
Green grow the lilacs all sparklin' with you  
I'm lonely, my darling, since partin' with you  
And by the next meeting, I hope to prove true  
And change the green lilacs to the red white and blue

In the desert where we searched for gold  
The days're hot the nights're cold  
Hank and Joe and me walked on  
So bold and brave and free  
For days and days we fought the heat  
I got so thirsty and I got so weak  
And when I fell 'cause I couldn't go  
I heard Hank say to Joe  
He's dyin'  
(Dyin' dyin')  
For water  
Hear him cryin'  
(Cryin' cryin')  
For water  
Well lay him down in the dust and sand he said  
Joe you know he's a dyin' man  
Leave him there and let him die  
I can't stand to hear him cry for water  
I don't remember how long I lay  
But when I awoke it was the break of day  
Buzzards circled miles ahead  
I knew Hank and Joe were dead  
My eyes were dimmed but I could see  
A bed of gold nuggets under me  
Now I know that it won't be long  
Till they decorate my bones  
'Cause I'm dyin'  
(Dyin' dyin')  
For water  
Can't help cryin'  
(Cryin' cryin')  
For water  
Well they laid me down in the dust and sand he said  
Joe you know he's a dyin' man  
Leave him there and let him die  
I can't stand to hear him cry for water  
He couldn't stand to hear me cry for water  

Way down the mountain I chased a moonbeam  
On the beach I built sand castles too  
My moonbeams faded my castles tumbled  
All of this was meaningless 'cause happiness is you  
No more chasing moonbeams or catching falling stars  
I know now my pot of gold is anywhere you are  
My heart won't miss you my heart goes with you  
Loneliness is emptiness but happiness is you  
I tried to doubt you and live without you  
Tried to deny but I love you like a do  
But I realize now and I'll admit it  
You'll always be a part of me 'cause happiness is you  
No more chasing moonbeams  

Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
Peace on earth and mercy mild  
God and sinners reconciled  
  
Joyful all ye nations rise  
Join the triumph of the skies  
With angelic host proclaim  
Christ is born in Bethlehem  
  
Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
  
Hail the Heaven born Prince of peace  
Hail the Son of righteousness  
Light and life to all He brings  
Risen with healing in His wings  
  
Mild He lays His glory by  
Born that Man no more may die  
Born to raise the sons of earth  
Born to give them second birth  
  
Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King  
Hark the Herald angels sing  
Glory to the new born King

Harley didn't have no education he could hardly read and write  
He was locked into a dead-end occupation his future didn't look too bright  
He worked eighteen years on the assembly line  
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime  
And that could be the end of this story of mine but it's just the beginning  
Late one night when he was workin' graveyard Harley got himself this big  
idea  
All he's have to do is change one little screw a save millions of dollars a  
year  
So he worked and he saved till he could open his own shop  
Money started rollin' in like it wasn't gonna stop  
So Harley bought a mountain built a mansion on top  
So the losers could see whom was winnin'  
Only in America with nothin' but a dream only in America where every man's  
king  
  
First Harley's daughter Janet found a guru she gave him everything she  
owned  
Then Harley junior joined some kind of rockband  
And walked around all day about half stoned  
His wife watched TV all the time cause she got bored  
Then one day she found a TV preacher she adored  
And she gave all of Harley's hard earned money to the Lord  
Harley started drinkin' wound up in Betty Ford to see if he could by a  
happy ending  
Then some kid who worked in Harley's factory he got himself this big idea  
Figured out how to do it with compures drove Harley out of business in a  
year  
Now Harley's back working the assembly line  
Just gettin' by with a little bit of overtime  
But don't count Harley out cause he ain't the quittin' kind  
He stares at that computer with one thing on his mind  
How to make them things more user-friendly  
Only in America  
Only in America

Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!  
Thou art the Potter, I am the clay.  
Mold me and make me after Thy will,  
While I am waiting, yielded and still.  
  
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!  
Search me and try me, Master, today!  
Whiter than snow, Lord, wash me just now,  
As in Thy presence humbly I bow.  
  
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!  
Wounded and weary, help me, I pray!  
Power, all power, surely is Thine!  
Touch me and heal me, Savior divine.  
  
Have Thine own way, Lord! Have Thine own way!  
Hold o'er my being absolute sway!  
Fill with Thy Spirit 'till all shall see  
Christ only, always, living in me.

He said "I'll love you till I die",  
She told him "You'll forget in time"  
As the years went slowly by,  
She still preyed upon his mind  
  
He kept her picture on his wall,  
Went half-crazy now and then  
He still loved her through it all,  
Hoping she'd come back again  
  
Kept some letters by his bed  
Dated nineteen sixty-two  
He had underlined in red  
Every single "I love you"  
  
I went to see him just today,  
Oh but I didn't see no tears  
All dressed up to go away, first time  
I'd seen him smile in years  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon they'll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today  
  
You know,  
She came to see him one last time.  
Aww, 'n' we all wondered if she would.  
And it kept runnin' through my mind  
"This time he's over her for good."  
  
He stopped loving her today  
They placed a wreath upon his door  
And soon they'll carry him away  
He stopped loving her today

I want to live,  
I want to give  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.  
It's these expressions I never give  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
  
I've been to Hollywood  
I've been to redwood  
I crossed the ocean for a heart of gold  
I've been in my mind, it's such a fine line  
That keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
It keeps me searching for a heart of gold  
And I'm getting old.  
  
You keep me searching for a heart of gold  
I've been a miner for a heart of gold.  
And I'm getting old.

Some days I think this old machine is out to get me  
Some days she does what I tell her  
It's like dancing with the widow-maker forty hours a week  
I'm talkin' 'bout a big old D10 Caterpillar  
  
I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do  
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel  
Could be the money babe, could be the power  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels  
  
But you know she's mighty unforgivin' and you got to pay attention  
'Cause the d-10 can be the death of you  
But I get her all fired up and I can feel it in my soul  
And it's hard to tell just who's drivin' who  
  
I can move Alaska all the way to Beirut  
I can bulldoze a beeline from here to Peru  
I can push the rocky mountains into the sea  
You know heavy metal don't mean rock and roll to me  
  
I'm like a modern day mule skinner, drivin' ten thousand mules  
So say a little prayer every day  
Lord, just let me get her turned around without fallin' off this mountain  
You know the boss man don't like us treatin' his D10 that way  
  
I don't know why I like to drive 'em like I do  
It ain't nothin' but a hundred and seventy-five thousand pounds of steel  
Could be the money babe, could be the power  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels  
  
Could be I love the way it feels  
Could be I love the way it feels

(Joy to the world the Lord is come)  
Here was a man a man who was born in a small village the son of a peasant
woman  
He grew up in another small village  
Until he reached the age of thirty he worked as a carpenter  
  
Then for three years he was a traveling minister  
But he never traveled more than two hundred miles from where he was born  
And where he did go he usually walked  
He never held political office he never wrote a book never bought a home  
  
Never had a family he never went to college and he never set foot inside a big
city  
Yes here was a man  
Though he never did one on the things usually associated with greatness  
He had no credentials but himself he had nothing to do with this world  
  
Except through the devine purpose that brought him to this world  
While he was still a young man the tide of popular opinion turned against him  
Most of his friends ran away one of them denied him  
One of them betrayed him and turned him over to his enemies  
  
Then he went through the mockery of a trial  
And was nailed to a cross between two thieves  
And even while he was dying his executioners gambled  
For the only piece of property that he had in this world  
  
And that was his robe his purple robe  
When he was dead he was taken down from the cross  
And laid in a borrowed grave provided by compassionate friends  
More than nineteen centuries have come and gone  
  
And today he's a centerpiece of the human race  
Our leader in the column to human destiny  
I think I'm well within the mark when I say that all of the armies that ever
marched  
All of the navies that ever sailed the seas  
  
All of the legislative bodies that ever sat and all of the kings that ever
reigned  
All of them put together have not affected the life of man on this earth  
So powerfully as that one solitary life  
Here was a man (joy to the world the Lord is come)

Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
Hey, hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe  
We could find us a brand new recipe?  
  
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill  
And I know a spot right over the hill  
There's soda pop and the dancin's free  
If you wanna have fun come along with me  
  
Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
  
I'm free and ready so we can go steady  
How's about savin' all your time for me?  
No more lookin', I know, I've been tooken  
How's about keepin' steady company?  
  
I'm gonna throw my date book over the fence  
Find me one for five or ten cents  
Keep it till it's covered with age  
Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page  
  
Say hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?

I'm sorry to say that you don't know me  
I'm sad in ways you never understood  
Each time I try to tell the ugly truth, you always let it pass you by  
You said I 'd never tell you a lie, just because I could  
Did you really think I was a bad man?  
You always said that, that should be my middle name  
But you don't know the half of it, you don't know how that name fits  
You don't know my hidden shame  
Hidden shame, shame, shame  
That I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
Well, there's a different kind of prison  
And it don't even have to look much like a cell  
It's already on your mind boy, we can see it in your eyes  
So, here's the bars and walls as well  
Well, you know I'm never coming home, babe  
You said you'd stand by me until I cleared my name  
Sure it's easy to be strong when you know the charge is wrong  
But the days and weeks get long  
When you've got a hidden shame  
Hidden shame, shame, shame  
That I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
I had a friend when I was just a boy  
We were like brothers, we would run and hide  
And we went walking on a high hillside  
And I really don't know how it happened  
He turned to me and had this strange look in his eye  
And not a single word was spoken  
I must have pushed him, but I don't remember why?  
And all at once, he lay there broken  
And I walked down without him and I didn't even sigh  
Hidden shame, shame, shame  
That I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
They say you always hurt the one you love  
And I'm not saying if I did or if I didn't  
But like my shame, that kind of love is always hidden  
They locked me up here for the ideas in my head  
They never got me for the thing I really did  
Hidden shame, shame, shame  
That I can't get free  
From the blame and the torture and the misery  
Must it be my secret for eternity?  
Till you know my hidden shame you really don't know me  
You really don't know me, you really don't know me  

My name is Joe Roberts I work for the State  
I'm a sergeant out on Perenville barracks No 8  
I've always done an honest job honest as I could  
Got a brother named Frankie Frankie ain't no good  
Ever since we were young kids it's been the same come down  
I'd get a call on a short way Frankie's in trouble downtown  
But if it was any other man I'd put him straight away  
But sometimes when it's your brother you look the other way  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah me and Frankie laughin' and drinkin' nothin' feels better than blood on
blood  
Takin' turns dancin' with Maria  
  
While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'  
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother should  
Man turns his back on his family he ain't no good  
Well Frankie went into the army back in 1965  
I got a farm deferment settled down took Maria for my wife  
But them wheat prices kept on droppin' till it was like we's gettin' robbed  
Frankie came home in '68 and me I took this job  
  
[Chorus]  
  
While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'  
I catch him when he's strayin' teach him how to walk that line  
Man turns his back on his family ain't no friend of mine  
The night was like any other I got a call bout the quarter of nine  
There was trouble at a roadhouse out on the Michigan line  
There was a kid on the floor lookin' bad bleedin' hard from his head  
There was a girl cryin' at a table it was Frankie she said  
I ran out and I jumped in my car then I hit the lights  
I must have done about a hundred and ten to Michigan County that night  
It was down by the crossroads out bout willow bank  
Seen the Buick with Ohio plates behind the wheel was Frank  
Well I chased him through them county roads  
Till the sign said Canadian border five miles from here  
Pulled over to the south out the highway watched his taillights disappeared  
  
[Chorus]  
  
While the band played 'The Night Of The Johnstown Flood'  
I catch him when he's strayin' like any brother should  
Man turns his back on his family ain't no good

I was a highwayman.  
Along the coach roads I did ride  
With sword and pistol by my side  
Many a young maid lost her baubles to my trade  
Many a soldier shed his lifeblood on my blade  
The bastards hung me in the spring of twenty-five  
But I am still alive.  
  
I was a sailor.  
I was born upon the tide  
And with the sea I did abide.  
I sailed a schooner round the Horn to Mexico  
I went aloft and furled the mainsail in a blow  
And when the yards broke off they said that I got killed  
But I am living still.  
  
I was a dam builder.  
Across the river deep and wide  
Where steel and water did collide  
A place called Boulder on the wild Colorado  
I slipped and fell into the wet concrete below  
They buried me in that great tob that knows no sound  
But I am still around  
I'll always be around  
And around and around and around and around.  
  
I fly a star ship.  
Across the Universe divide  
And when I reach the other side  
I'll find a place to rest my spirit if I can  
Perhaps I may become a highwayman again  
Or I may simply be a single drop of rain  
But I will remain  
And I'll be back again, and again and again and again and again...

I woke up this afternoon and looked into your eyes  
And somethin' was as wrong as if the sun forgot to rise  
I picked up a road map and I checked a few good places that I know  
And if you're no longer givin', I believe I'll hit the road and go  
  
I just got the feelin' that the fire was burnin' out  
'Cause the air was turnin' colder every time you came about  
And a flame won't take a fannin' if the last reserve of love is runnin' low  
So since I've gotta button up, I believe I'll hit the road and go  
  
County road 6-40, State Highway 45  
Life out of the interstate is very much alive  
There's magic in the mountains and music in the valleys down below  
And my song ain't through playin' yet so I believe I'll hit the road and go  
  
Good morning to you sunshine, good morning to you rain  
The windshield wiper's rhythm keeps me singin' down the pain  
Today I'm gonna miss you less if I miss you at all  
You'll never know, you'll never know  
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go  
This rambler has cut all the ties and pulled up stakes to hit the road and go

Just around the corner there's heartache  
Down the street that losers use  
If you can wade in through the teardrops  
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues  
  
I walk and cry while my heartbeat  
Keeps time with the drag of my shoes  
The sun never shines through this window of mine  
It's dark at the Home of the Blues  
  
Oh, but the place is filled with the sweetest mem'ries  
Memories so sweet that I cry  
Dreams that I've had left me feeling so bad  
I just want to give up and lay down and die  
  
So if you've just lost your sweetheart  
And it seems there's no good way to choose  
Come along with me, misery loves company  
You're welcome at the Home of the Blues  
  
Just around the corner there's heartache  
Down the street that losers use  
If you can wade in through the teardrops  
You'll find me at the Home of the Blues  
Yeah, you're gonna find me at the Home of the Blues

Don't be fool by big blue eyes by a smile or a golden curl  
Cause she'll love you now and then break every vow cause she's just a honky
tonk girl  
Breaking hearts to her is just the way of having fun  
She thinks every man's a fool and you're another one  
She knows all the arts of love she'll give your heart a twirl  
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl  
  
She can never change your ways though you'll give her all the world  
She's had more than one or two and each day there's someone new  
Cause she's just a honky tonk girl  
Breaking hearts to her

I hurt myself today  
To see if I still feel  
I focus on the pain  
The only thing that's real  
  
The needle tears a hole  
The old familiar sting  
Try to kill it all away  
But I remember everything  
  
[Chorus]  
What have I become  
My sweetest friend  
Everyone I know  
Goes away in the end  
  
And you could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
  
I wear this crown of thorns  
Upon my liars chair  
Full of broken thoughts  
I cannot repair  
  
Beneath the stains of time  
The feelings disappear  
You are someone else  
I am still right here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you could have it all  
My empire of dirt  
I will let you down  
I will make you hurt  
  
If I could start again  
A million miles away  
I will keep myself  
I would find a way

I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
I've got a home in that yonder city, good lord  
And it's not, not made by hand  
  
I've got a mother, sister and a brother  
Who have gone this way before  
I am determined to go and see them, good lord  
For they're on that other shore  
  
I'm goin' down to the river of Jordan  
Just to bathe my wearisome soul  
If I can just touch the hem of his garment, good lord  
Then I know he'd take me home  
  
I am a pilgrim and a stranger  
Traveling through this wearisome land  
I've got a home in that yonder city, good lord  
And it's not, not made by hand

Well the blue's still in the water and the blue's still in the sky  
And way beyond the blue there's someone watchin' from on high  
My clothes may be ragged and my shoes may be worn  
But I've been a wealthy boy since I've been born  
Cause I call him when I'm troubled and I call him when I'm weak  
And he always pulls me through my troubles some way and I believe  
He'll be there (he'll be there) he'll be there (he'll be there)  
Like he always is to answer when I call him  
  
My mother used to tell me I should take it slow  
The pace is not what matters it's the direction that you go  
Keep your feet upon the path and your eyes upon the goal  
You'll have all the joy a heart could ever hold  
Cause I call him when I'm troubled...  
Like he always is to answer when I call him

I couldn't manage the problem I laid on myself  
And it just made it worse when I laid them on somebody else  
So I finally surrendered it all, brought down in despair  
I cried out for help and I felt a warm comforter there  
  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
I came to believe that I needed help to get by  
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
  
Nothing worked out when I handled it all on my own  
And each time I failed it made me feel twice as alone  
Then I cried "Lord there must be a surer and easier way  
For it just cannot be that a man should lose hope everyday"  
  
And I came to believe in a power much higher than I  
I came to believe that I needed help to get by  
In childlike faith I gave in and gave him a try  
Then I came to believe in a power much higher than I

Today I passed you on the street and my heart fell at your feet  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
Somebody else stood by your side and he looked so satisfied  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
A picture from the past came slowly stealing  
As I brushed your arm and walked so close to you  
Then suddenly, I got that old time feeling  
I can't help it if I'm still in love with you  
  
It's hard to know, another's lips will kiss you  
And hold you just the way I used to do  
Oh, Heaven only knows how much I miss you

Everybody says you let me down I should be ashamed to take you round  
Makes no difference what you used to do darling I could never be ashamed of
you  
  
Maybe you were reckless yesterday but together we can find a brighter way  
In my heart I know that you'll come true darling I could never be ashamed of
you  
  
All the happiness I've ever known came the day you said you'd be my own  
And it matters not what we go through darling I could never be ashamed of you  
  
Maybe you've been cheated in the past and perhaps those memories will always
last  
Even though you prove to be untrue darling I could never be ashamed of you

I have to sit down for  
Ok, we'll, we'll do that for you, just a minute, thank you  
There's a young man here at, at uh San Quentin  
Tonight that wrote a song that I just  
Saw written down on paper for the first time yesterday  
He sent me the sheet music on it,  
And I don't know anyone that reads music  
Except, maybe Helen  
And um, I liked the lyrics so much I started singing my own tune to it, you
know  
The first thing that come to my mind  
Hey, lemme see that, let's just try a little bit of it right here  
  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
Whistles calling me away  
Leaving at the break of day and  
And I don't know where I'm bound  
  
Can't stand locks, bars or doors  
Mean cops insanity and wars  
Gotta find a place of peace  
Till then much travelin' won't cease  
But I don't know where I'm bound  
  
There's gotta be a place for me  
Under some green growing tree  
Clear cool water running by  
An unfettered view of the sky  
But I don't know where I'm bound  
  
When I die don't bury me  
Cause then I must be free  
Cremate my body with a grin  
Throw my ashes to the wind  
Cause I don't know where I'm bound  
  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
Whistles calling me away  
Leaving at the break of day  
And I don't know where I'm bound  
  
Got myself a little gal  
She has been a damn right pall  
That ol' highway's calling me  
And free I gotta be but  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
I don't know where I'm bound  
  
Thank you very much

She gave me my walking papers  
And ran off with someone new  
'Cause he bought her things  
My wages couldn't buy  
So I turned to ups and downers  
And everything between  
Still I can't get her good lovin'  
Off my mind  
  
Well today I bought a Cadillac  
The kind she's always wanted  
I called and asked her  
If she'd like to ride  
She said this is our last date  
I said that's alright with me  
'Cause tonight I'm driving her  
Out of my mind  
  
Yeah I'll take her on a scenic cruise  
Right off of Lookout Mountain  
Cause she said I never took her out  
When she was mine  
She'll see all seven states  
As we drive to the pearly gates  
Tonight when I drive her  
Out of my mind  
  
All the papers will read "Lovers leap  
Again off Lookout Mountain"  
'Cause I wrote a note  
That called it suicide  
But my epitaph will say  
"He killed his pain yesterday  
When he finally drove that woman  
Off his mind"  
  
Well now here she comes to greet me  
Dressed to kill and so am I  
Hope she asks me if this  
Cadillac will fly  
And I know that I'll die laughin'  
When I show her that it will  
When I drive that woman  
Right out of my mind  
  
Hell I'll take her on a scenic cruise  
Right off of Lookout Mountain  
'Cause she said I never took her out  
When she was mine  
She'll see all seven states  
As we drive to the pearly gates  
Tonight when I drive her  
Out of my mind  
  
They'll say Johnny Cash was quite a smash  
Down here in Chattanooga  
Last night when he drove her  
Out of his mind  
  
Yeah that Cadillac dealer's in for a big surprise too  
99 dollars down, 99 dollars a month  
Yeah it's gonna be just gorgeous  
  
(Ooh to the pearly gates)  
(Ooh to the pearly gates)  
(Ooh to the pearly gates)

On a Monday,  
I was arrested (uh huh)  
On a Tuesday,  
They locked me in the jail (oh boy)  
On a Wednesday,  
My trial was attested  
On a Thursday,  
They said guilty and  
The Judge's gavel fell  
  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains,  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains, them chains,  
They're about to drag me down  
  
On a Monday,  
My momma come to see me  
On a Tuesday,  
They caught me with a file  
On a Wednesday,  
I'm down in solitary  
On a Thursday,  
I start on bread and water for a while  
  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains,  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains, them chains,  
They're about to drag me down  
  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
I got chains,  
Chains around my feet  
I got stripes,  
Stripes around my shoulders  
And them chains, them chains,  
They're about to drag me down

I was riding number nine  
Heading South from Caraloine  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
I got in trouble, had to roam  
I left my gal an' left my home  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
Just a kid, actin' smart  
I went and broke my darling's heart  
I guess I was too young to know  
  
They took me off the Georgia Main  
Locked me to a ball and chain  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
All alone I bear the shame  
I'm a number, not a name  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
All I do is sit an' cry  
When that evenin' train goes by  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow  
  
I'll be locked here in this cell  
Till my body's just a shell  
An' my hair turns whiter than snow  
  
I'll never see that gal of mine  
I'm in Georgia, doin' time  
I heard that lonesome whistle blow

I heard the bells on Christmas Day  
Their old familiar carols play  
And wild and sweet the words repeat  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
I thought how as the day had come  
The belfries of all Christendom  
Had rolled along unbroken song  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
And in despair I bowed my head  
There is no peace on earth I said  
For hate is strong that mocks the song  
Of peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead, nor doubt he sleeps  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on earth goodwill to men.  
  
'Til ringin' singin' on its way  
The world revolve from night to day  
A voice, a chime, a chance so blind,  
On earth goodwill to men.  
  
Then pealed the bells more loud and deep  
God is not dead nor doubt he sleeps  
The wrong shall fail, the right prevail  
With peace on earth goodwill to men.

Early one morning  
With time to kill  
I borrowed Jebb's rifle  
And sat on a hill  
I saw a lone rider  
Crossing the plain  
I drew a bead on him  
To practice my aim  
  
My brother's rifle  
Went off in my hand  
A shot rang out  
Across the land  
The horse, he kept running  
The rider was dead  
I hung my head  
I hung my head  
  
I set off running  
To wake from the dream  
My brother's rifle  
Went into the sheen  
I kept on running  
Into the south lands  
That's where they found me  
My head in my hands  
  
The sheriff he asked me  
Why had I run  
And then it come to me  
Just what I had done  
And all for no reason  
Just one piece of lead  
I hung my head  
I hung my head  
  
Here in the court house  
The whole town was there  
I see the judge  
High up in the chair  
Explain to the court room  
What went through your mind  
And we'll ask the jury  
What verdict they find  
  
I felt the power  
Of death over life  
I orphaned his children  
I widowed his wife  
I begged their forgiveness  
I wish I was dead  
I hung my head  
I hung my head  
I hung my head  
I hung my head  
  
Early one morning  
With time to kill  
I see the gallows  
Up on a hill  
And out in the distance  
A trick of the brain  
I see a lone rider  
Crossing the plain  
  
And he'd come to fetch me  
To see what they'd done  
And we'll ride together  
To kingdom come  
I prayed for God's mercy  
'Cause soon I'd be dead  
I hung my head  
I hung my head  
  
I hung my head  
I hung my head

I just thought you'd like to know  
Since you'd made your plans to go  
It's gonna hurt me so to see you go  
But I hope you find another love and he'll be good to you  
But still and yet I can't forget the things we used to do  
  
I just thought I tell you this  
I love you since that first sweet kiss  
It's gonna hurt to miss your tender kiss  
But I hope you get to do the things you say you wanna do  
But still and yet I can't forget the happiness we knew  
  
I just thought you'd like to know how much you've hurt my pride  
I just thought you'd like to know how much my heart has cried over you  
But darling you could never see the misery you caused for me  
So I will tell you so cause I just thought that you'd like to know

I love you because you understand, dear  
Every little thing I try to do  
Your always there to lend a helping hand dear  
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you  
  
No matter what may be the style or season  
I know your love will always see me through  
I love you for a hundred, thousand reasons  
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you  
(Most of, most of all I love you because you're you)  
  
I love you because my heart is lighter  
Every time I'm walking by your side  
I love you because the future's brighter  
The glow to happiness you've opened wide  
  
No matter what the world may say about me  
I know your heart will always be true  
I love you for the way you never doubt me  
But most of all I love you 'cause you're you

[Chorus]  
I never picked cotton  
But my mother did  
And my brother did  
And my sister did  
And my daddy died young  
Workin' in a coal mine  
  
When I was just a baby  
Too little for a cotton sack  
I played in the dirt  
While others worked  
Til they couldn't straighten their backs  
I made myself a promise  
When I was big enough to run  
That I'd never stay a single day  
In that Oklahoma sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Folks said I grew up early  
And that the farm couldn't hold me then so I stole ten bucks  
And a pickup truck  
And I never went back again  
Then it was fast cars and whiskey  
Long haired girls and fun  
I had everything that money could bring  
And I took it with a gun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was Saturday night in Memphis  
When a redneck grabbed my shirt  
When he said go back to your cotton sack  
I left him dying in the dirt  
They'll take me in the morning  
To the gallos just outside  
And in the time I got  
There ain't a hell of a lot  
That I can look back on with pride

I ride an old paint, I lead an old Dan  
I'm off to Montan' for to throw the hooley ann  
They feed in the coulees, they water in the draw  
Their tails are all matted, their backs are all raw  
Ride around little dogies, ride around slow  
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go  
Well John's had two daughters and the song  
One went to Denver the other went wrong  
His young wife died in a poolroom fight  
But he tries to keep singing from morning till night  
Ride around little dogies, ride around slow  
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go  
When I die take my saddle from the wall  
Strap it my pony, lead him out of the stall  
Throw my bones on his back, turn our faces to the west  
And we'll ride the prairie that we love the best  
Ride around little dogies, ride around slow  
The fiery and snuffy are raring to go  

Last night I dreamed  
An angel came  
He took my hand  
He called my name  
He bid me look  
The other way  
I saw a man  
I heard him say  
  
He said if I be lifted up  
I'll draw all men to me  
He turned and then  
I saw the nail-scared hand  
That bled for me  
I touched the hem of his garment  
That fell round him there  
My life, my heart, I gave  
My soul was in his care  
  
When I awoke  
My heart beat so  
And in the dark  
I saw a glow  
This was no dream  
He turned my way  
Again I heard  
My saviour say  
  
He said if I be lifted up  
I'll draw all men to me  
He turned and then  
I saw the nail-scared hand  
That bled for me  
I touched the hem of his garment  
That fell 'round him there  
My life, my heart, I gave  
My soul was in his care  
(In his care)

Well, you're my friend  
And you can see  
May times we've been out drinking  
Many times we've shared our thoughts  
Did you ever, ever notice, the kind of thoughts I got  
Well you know I have a love, for everyone I know  
And you know I have a drive, for life that won't let go  
But sometimes the opposition come rising up in me  
This terrible imposition, comes blacking through my mind  
  
And then I see a darkness  
Oh no, I see a darkness  
Do you know how much I love you  
Cause I'm hoping some day soon  
You'll save me from this darkness  
  
Well, I hope that someday soon  
We'll find peace in our lives  
Together or apart  
Alone or with our wives  
And we can stop our whoring  
And draw the smiles inside  
And light it up forever  
And never go to sleep  
My best unbeaten brother  
That isn't all I see  
  
And then I see a darkness  
Oh no, I see a darkness  
Do you know how much I love you  
Cause I'm hoping someday soon  
You'll save me from this darkness

Well you talk about important people that you say you know  
Presidents and superstars of big television shows  
Well I know someone personally who's bigger than 'em all  
And next to him your superstars look mighty small  
And I have a talk with him each day and he's interested in every word I say  
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day  
  
Well now I don't think that I'll ever be in any Hall of Fame  
And the social register of wealthy folks might drop my name  
But my name is written in the book of life I'm proud to say  
And that's all that really matters anyway  
And I talk to Jesus every day and he's interested in every word I say  
No secretary ever tells me he's been called away I talk to Jesus every day  
I talk to Jesus every day

This world that I live in is empty and cold  
This loneliness cuts me and tears at my soul  
I'm no child of destiny, no fortune's son  
I've just chased you so long now, I'm too weak to run  
So here I return to a back street of thrills  
Back to any warm shoulder till she's got her fill  
And then I treat shame like an old friend from home  
That I can lean on till the misery is gone  
A new day is here yet nothing is new  
You're still gone and I tremble for you  
I cry out at bedtime no, please not tonight  
But again there's your footsteps and I turn on the light  
Of course you're not there, no, you never are  
Then I try to forget that there's always a bar  
And well, I win that battle, yes, sometimes I do  
But sleep doesn't come when I tremble for you  

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine,  
I keep my eyes wide open all the time,  
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds,  
Because you're mine, I walk the line.  
  
I find it very, very easy to be true,  
I find myself alone when each day's through,  
Yes, I'll admit that I'm a fool for you,  
Because you're mine, I walk the line.  
  
As sure as night is dark and day is light,  
I keep you on my mind both day and night,  
And happiness I've known proves that it's right,  
Because you're mine, I walk the line.  
  
You've got a way to keep me on your side,  
You give me cause for love that I can't hide,  
For you I know I'd even try to turn the tide,  
Because you're mine, I walk the line.  
  
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine,  
I keep my eyes wide open all the time,  
I keep the ends out for the tie that binds,  
Because you're mine, I walk the line.

We sailed on the ship John B my grandfather and me around Nassau town we did
roam  
Drinking all night got into a fight well I feel so homesick I wanna go home  
  
So hoist up the John B sail see how the mainsail sets  
Call for the captain ashore let me go home  
  
Let me go home why don't you let me go home  
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home  
  
The first mate he got drunk broke up the people's trunk  
Constable had to come and take him away  
  
Sheriff John Stone why don't you leave me alone  
Well I feel so homesick I wanna go home  
  
Then the cook he caught the fits threw out all of my grits  
Then he took and ate up all of my corn  
  
Let me go home why don't you let me go home  
Well this is the worst trip since I have been born  
  
So hoist up the John B sail.

I Wanted So to tell that old man, Oh so many things  
Like the corn was 10 feet tall, that he had planted in the sping  
And the books he'd ordered came in in the mail just yesterday  
But he never said a word and life slowly slipped away  
  
I Wanted So to tell him just how much he meant to me  
I Wanted So to thank him for what he taught me that I could be  
I wanted him to know, that his grandchildren all were there  
And that his four year old grandson said "Papa, I said a prayer"  
  
I wanted to apologize for always being on the go  
For never having enough time to talk about the things that he needed so  
I Wanted So to tell him "Pop, your loved ones all are here"  
But he just lay there with his eyes closed, and I think he she'd a knowing
tear  
  
Yes, I Wanted So to tell that old man, Oh so many things  
Like the corn was 10 feet tall, that he had planted in the sping  
And the books he'd ordered came in, in the mail just yesterday  
But he never said a word and life just slowly slipped away

I will miss you when you go much more than you'll ever know  
But I'll have a memory to keep you near  
  
In my heart you will remain but it just won't be the same  
I will miss a million things that make you dear  
  
Your lovely ways make you so sweet I prayed the angels fair will keep  
You're happiness so you'll be blessed just as you deserve to be  
  
I wonder why there are so few lovely people like you  
My but I will surely miss you when you go  
  
Your lovely ways make you

[Verse 1]  
Well I won't back down, no I won't back down  
You can stand me up at the gates of hell  
But I won't back down  
  
[Verse 2]  
Gonna stand my ground, won't be turned around  
And I'll keep this world from draggin' me down  
Gonna stand my ground and I won't back down  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out  
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down  
  
[Verse 3]  
Well I know what's right, I got just one life  
In a world that keeps on pushin' me around  
But I stand my ground and I won't back down  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey baby, there ain't no easy way out  
Hey I will stand my ground and I won't back down  
No I won't back down.
