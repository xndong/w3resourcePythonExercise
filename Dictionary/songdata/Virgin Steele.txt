Magick speaks with tongues of Fire, Fortune take my hand  
Iron pounding dongs of Glory, Soaring on command  
Screaming I rejoin the fray  
  
Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take my where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
Sound the trumpet, crack the mountain, let the arrow fly  
Through the land of Lamentation, let the tidings fly  
Mercury, the God and I  
  
Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
Spark the ashes, free the temple, stem the crimson tide  
Toll the bells of Freedom souting  
Praise for those who've died  
Wield the Sword of Destiny  
  
Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
If passion denies you, don't die on your knees  
Fight with a vengeance what weakness decrees  
The Wrath of the Tempest, the cries of the slain  
Tragic in splendor, in death you are free  
I follow the Sign, bring on the sound of thunder,  
bring on the rain  
Spirit of Dark Enchantment remember my name!!!  
  
Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the thunder walks, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
Take me where the falcon flies, A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE  
  
A SYMPHONY OF STEELE

[ENDYAMON "Show you no mercy, we're far from the Light in PURGATORY:]  
Sign in the distance, leave it behind . . .  
There is no meaning, when the promises are lies I'll bring you pain,

Blessed Gods, Cold Stars, release me from my long suffering  
Anxious, Weary, my Mind wracked by Fears unnatural I Scan The Horizon  
Watching, hoping for Signs of the Signal Fire  
Great Gift of Prometheus, reward me with the news that Troy has  
Finally Fallen!  
It is She who commands me thus to remain upon this Palace roof  
Watching, waiting... that willful, calculating Woman, who plots  
And Schemes, like a King!!!  
No sleep, no Dreams, only Fear descends upon my couch and Ravages  
My Heart  
Yes Sorrow and Fear for what's become of this House  
Once so Great, now lost and cold, Hungry Spirits stalk these Halls  
But still I'll keep my Faith and Pray for our release from all  
This suffering...  
Look there... at last... Conquest! Great Blaze of Triumph,  
I Greet thee, I Honour thee most Welcome Visitor from the Depths  
Of the Night  
Rape the Sky like a Royal Sun, turn this Mournful Night into  
Shining Day!  
Awake Queen of Agamemnon, rise from thy sleep  
Cry the Morning Song of Victory, for the Kingdom of Ilion has Fallen  
The God of Fire proclaims it so  
We'll reap this Harvest of Flame, give Thanks and Pay Tribute  
To the Deities that made us...  
Oh let it be so, let our Fleet return in Honour  
Over Lord Poseidon?s Sea, safe from Wind and Storm  
Let me stand before my King and Pledge him Sword and Life for his Glory  
A Thorn grips my voice, no more from me now  
Yet if this House could speak what a Tale it could tell  
Of Savage Murder, Betrayal, Ravenous Feasting and a Daimon with an  
Unquenchable thirst for Blood and Torn Flesh!!!  
No, no more from me, let actions speak! AWAKE!!!

London is mine, New York and Paris shall fall  
One Ring to Rule in Darkness to bind them all  
Come to me now a moth to the Flame  
Burning your eyes as you stare  
With the Blood of the Salnts  
  
Stand on the shore watching the ships as they burn  
None will be found the sea will be their final urn  
Come to me now a moth to the Flame  
Burning your eyes as you stare  
I will devour a Specter of Power I will be King for a Day  
  
In passion denicd you call to the gods  
In gluttinous sin your face so sublime  
With the Blood of the Saints

By the gods - Black Slaughter  
By the gods - You're King  
By the gods - Blind Justice  
By the gods - We Sing  
All shall heel, all shall hear!  
By the gods - Your Father  
By the gods - Your Soul  
By the gods - In Fire  
By the gods - You're owned  
All shall heel, all shall hear!  
  
Gods and Devils screaming out their Final Warning  
Holy Fire from the Sky  
Violent Mourning Burns the Rays of Olympus  
While the Blood drips from their eyes  
And the Crime shakes the Hall, "Are you ready"  
When you see the Liar Burn  
  
Yet the Kanons are the Snakes of his Torment, at the Naval of the Earth  
I see the Sons of the Crown of the New  
Covered in Bloodlust and shame  
I feel the Whip of the Great Son of Zeus  
Lashing my Honour and Place  
Lightning won't remove the Crown We hold True  
I see the Face of the God, I see the Face of the God on his Black Soul  
  
I see the Madness as I look into your eyes  
Impaling Terror unfit for this Shrine  
Riding in Thunder the Murdering Rain  
Leave this Shrine and the Halls of the Mighty  
Go and Haunt the Slaughterhouse!  
  
I see the Sons of the Crown of our New  
King of the Heavens of Shame  
I see the tricks of the Lords We once Ruled  
I see the Face of the God, I see the Face of the God on his Black Soul  
  
Let the Goddess of Fortune decide who'll never return  
  
Will the Day break instead of the Night, the Victim returns  
  
In the Silence of the City, I await Fortune or Fire  
Dear Athena be my Healer, I am here knowing that Life may never return...  
  
And when you Die you'll meet the World's Suffering  
Plunge into the Black Night Sky  
We are in Force, We are called as One... All as One  
Holding the Ancient Right of Blood...

Forged in fire, tempered in steel,  
Children of the storm  
Never kneel!!!  
  
Tear down the walls!  
Break the chain! The wicked wind is howling and it's screaming out my name  
Above the ring of fire, the necromancer reigns  
With thunder and lightning, he enforces his command  
Of evil, lust and violence, destruction rules the land  
Children of the storm, on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
With wrathful hearts we've scaled the fortress  
Whose summits reach the sky  
In vain we roared and were defeated  
His majesty reigns high  
  
Weeping and wailing, another maiden dies  
In the wind and ice we gather to blast this demon from the sky  
  
Children of the storm, on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
Shadows fly past, but the Black Knight holds fast  
And I'll trust in the strength of my song  
Over the edge went the dark flame of dread,  
And it's all in the strength of my hand  
  
Children of the storm, on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
Children of the storm, on and on we run  
Children of the storm trying to find the sun  
  
Keep on your guard, trust in the sword, face,  
Face the flames...  
Face the flames!!!

The night is hot and so am I  
Darling feel the heat between my thighs  
You're a perfect angel sweet seventeen  
Moist and pink and hotter in between  
  
You touch me with that velvet touch  
Your body grips I can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on, love me  
Come on, take me home  
Bring it back, bring it back to life  
  
Give all your love to me girl!  
I'm Dave the lion, roar till I die  
I kiss the girls and then make them cry...  
With pleasure!  
  
I taste your lips, you drink my love  
It's a vintage year honey, '69  
  
You touch me with that velvet touch  
Your body grips me I can't get enough  
  
[Chorus]

[1st verse:]  
I'm not that kind of guy that likes to start trouble no  
But if you push me too far you never know what I might do  
I got a black cat bone and a magic hand, yes I do  
Anf if you don't watch out I'm going to put a spell on you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I got nothing to lose  
I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I like breaking the rules  
  
[2nd verse:]  
Meet me at Midnight if you like to live dangerously  
I've got some friends down here I really think you should meet  
Oooh, if you're looking for action I'm going to take you there  
Cause there's nothing in this world, nothing I wouldn't dare  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cause I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I got nothing to lose  
I'm a Dead, Dead End Kid  
I like breaking the rules  
  
[Bridge:]  
I got a one way ticket on a sinking ship  
And I'm going straight to hell  
Dead End Kid yeah!

From the North to the South,  
East and West Eyes that burn in the sight of the  
Dawn Flames of Hate and the Pathos of

Don't go, don't leave me here alone  
With nothing but a memory to call my own  
We shared each day, and the days to years  
But now the love we share is blinded by tears  
  
Look in my eyes and speak to me  
Can you really forget me?  
Ooh in the light you'll be alright  
But every evening I'll be haunting you  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't close your eyes tonight  
'Cause you know I'll be there in your dreams  
  
Oh babe don't go, don't go  
Don't leave me here alone  
Forget me not whatever you do  
And please remember that  
I still love you  
  
I made it clear I need you here  
Every night I cry for you  
And do you know I can't let go?  
Open up your arms I'm coming home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I made it clear I need you here  
Every night I cry for you  
And do you know I can't let go?  
Open up your arms I'm coming home  
  
[Chorus]

Fight, fight tooth and nail  
Fight, fight tooth and nail  
  
It's the law of the jungle  
The strongest will survive  
And that's the rule I live by  
Think fast and stay alive  
Keep the eye of the tiger  
Gather cunning, strength and speed  
Use evry trick you know  
Don't retreat until they bleed  
  
Your hand's a dwadly weapon  
Your teeth can rip in two  
Get'em before they get you  
There's no more time to loose  
  
[Chorus]  
Fight, fight tooth and nail  
If you think they'll show you mercy  
You better think again  
You gotta fight  
  
I'm akin to the lion, the tiger and the bear  
I use what nature gives, to rip and  
Slash and tear  
I'm really very gentle, rather make love  
Than go to war  
But if you try to harm me  
You'll die by neture's law  
  
My hand's a deadly weapon,  
My teeth can rip in two  
A present of death I give you  
I'll run you through and through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Once more into the cobra's nest  
A poisoned victory  
Blood stains the sands of history  
If you'll wage war, you'll get no pity from me, oh no...  
  
[Chorus]

Colder now, cold as the grave this town  
darkness falls the death of another soul  
empty lives the sins of the desperate  
shattered dreams a moments betrayal, forever will I roam  
forever will I roam  
  
[Chorus:]  
Forever will I roam a touch for a moment a scar for life  
Silent drifter on a highway side  
The heart of an angel, a killer's eyes  
  
Sacrifice, slaughter the love we made  
Blood and sand a victim of innocence  
Crime of pride, killing emotion  
Shroud of Tears inherit the wind, Forever will I roam  
Forever will I roam  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Speak to me, who are you anyway ?  
Vision of long drawn pain  
Calling and pleading  
Baring the guilty one again  
  
Colder now, cold as the grave this town  
Darkness falls, the eyes of a nameless stranger close  
  
[Chorus]

When the winds of ice are raging  
And the sun departs for night  
There's a thousand eyes upon you  
But no one sees your plight  
Oh no mercy hath the darkness  
No love or heavens rain  
You can feel the sound of anguish  
Hear the cries of screaming pain  
  
We are the guardians of the flame  
Masters of the ancient rites  
Our duty was ordained  
To protect the realm of light  
  
If you cross the gates of wisdom  
Beware of the outer sign  
Here the wolves of war are feasting  
And on who knows what they dine!  
Oh if your courage doth forsake you  
Invoke thy masters name  
We come with swords of fire  
To banish the profane  
  
Oh, we are the ones who check the forces of evil  
Flames fly from our hands to engulf  
The bastard called sin  
War, rains through the skies  
Our wrath shakes the pillars of heaven, now  
The jackal is slain, fountains of blood drench the land  
Come light up the torch, we have returned victorious  
  
All's well in the world tonight  
Sweet dreams from the palace of light  
Sleep well, my children

She'll bleed you dry  
She'll leave you there to die  
She'll cut you with a knife  
She'll carve away your life  
Yeah just like a wildcat  
She'll scratch you with her claws  
And if you try to leave her  
She'll stab you in the back  
  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Hell path no fury like a woman scorned!!!  
  
She's the kind of woman  
That's not hard to understand  
She cracks the whip and she holds the upper hand  
She'll bet ya, she'll mistreat ya  
Make you quiver and quail  
The female of the species is deadlier than the man  
  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Hell path no fury like a woman scorned!!!  
  
I know she's a demon but she answers to the name of woman  
Creature schooles in a dark desires and evil  
I jst be strong to resist this succubus  
Floating in orgies of passion  
She is my Goddess and I AM HER GOD  
  
On raven wings she glides into my bed  
Nocturnal rites, fear and passion wed  
Forbidden reason far below the sea  
Salvation shines from your divinity  
  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Hell path no fury like a woman scorned!!!  
HELLFIRE WOMAN  
HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN  
FIRE, HELLFIRE, HELLFIRE WOMAN...OH WOMAN  
Oh take it away!!!  
The beauty of the sin, oh...  
Damnation...HELLFIRE WOMAN  
Blood, blood at the gates of hell  
Lover, virgin, demon, whore  
Dark pagan queen...demon, whore

Cold light descending through curtains of dust  
Torn like the memory of what we wert and what became of us  
Gone with the Evening when morning stares  
Gone and forgotten Iike a photograph  
or the fragments of a dream  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let me know where to find you  
Cive me the chance to find you  
I'm Lost on my own in this House of Dust  
Heaven will not receive me  
Nobody will believe me  
I'm Lost on my own in this House of Dust  
  
Who tends the garden when I'm not there  
Who lights the candle  
through the darkest hours when the world is filled with fear  
I will remember when you were there  
sleeping beside me through the darkest hours  
when the world is bathed in fear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me know where to find you  
Why should I care to find you  
You left me alone in this House of Dust  
Your heaven will not receive you  
Nobody will believe you  
I'm setting the Flame to this House of Dust

Like a portrait born of hate  
like a lock without a key  
I am trapped here in this prison  
deliver me from me  
like a world within my head  
like a thorn in my side  
I am choking on your virtue  
what a way to die  
  
And the wind keeps on moaning  
shattered lightning from the skies  
all your promises are broken  
I think you just want to bury me  
I wake up screaming every night  
I wake up screaming  
  
Like a guardian of lies  
bringing laughter in disguise  
I am drowning in your bullshit  
what a way to die  
like a crystal virgin mind  
when you blindly lead the blind  
I am waiting for my requiem  
or the end of time  
  
And the wind keeps on moaning  
spitting right into your eyes  
every bridge is burned and broken  
do you think you want to fuck with me  
I wake up screaming every night  
I wake up screaming  
  
Ooh what to do now when I see your armour twist and crack  
Ooh what to do now when I rip the smile right from your face rip  
  
Like a portrait born of Hate  
Like a lock without a key  
I am trapped here, in this prison  
Deliver me from me  
  
And the wind keeps on moaning  
Spitting right into your eyes  
All your promises are broken  
Do you think you'll stand the test of time  
  
I Wake up Screaming every night  
I Wake up Screaming

Under tortured skies from a land with no sun  
I will come for you  
From seven points of darkness  
Beyond the mountains and the ruins  
I will come for you  
Across the fields of rage and yearning  
With power in my hand  
I will return, I will return  
  
Once we had beauty our Sun blazcd in passion  
We lived alive  
Far from the reaching of closed minded preaching  
We lived and died  
  
Now all in darkness we wait for the end,  
Hunted by men of the cloth  
Murder and torture, they rape and they slaughter  
Claiming the way of the cross  
  
Cast out from Eden baptized inta treason  
With sighless eyes  
Lost clouds of reason, false hope burning season  
A godless lie  
  
Whose god is stronger, who's made by its hand  
Primitive blood stains the sand  
Murder and torture they're raping your daughter  
Drunk with the blood of the lamb  
  
Fair child of the desolation cry to me,  
Under stars that have died  
Under skies of pain we are born  
Yea we are born, forever we'll be  
Oh my love I'll defy death and meet on holy ground  
  
Under tortured skies from a land with no sun  
I will come for you  
From seven points of darkness  
Beyond the mountains and the ruins  
I will come for you  
Across the fields of rage and yearning  
With power in my hand  
I will return, I will return  
  
Now like the sun, like the wind and the rain  
I'll return like a storm, I will rise once again  
Across the oceans of time I am called by your voice  
I'll return, I will return!!

I'm hot and I'm ready  
Like a star in the night  
Cold as ice  
Quicker than sight  
  
Yeah I'm wild and I'm mean  
Like a lion deep in heat  
You'll feel my love  
A pounding beat-Yeah!  
  
But what you don't see  
You'll never own me  
I hear the call of the wild  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm on fire, I'm on fire,  
Strange desire  
I'm on fire  
I'm on fire, on fire, I'm hot!  
  
My love is danger  
Oh my love is steele  
And I'm the vicious sting  
A raging king, a diamond ring  
And you're my meal  
  
Yeah I'm a phantom of delight  
I'll thrill you once  
I'll thrill you twice  
But when the first light- hits the sky  
I will be gone- gone!  
  
It's like I told you  
I'll never be true  
I hear the call of the wild  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say you love me  
Oh no you can't  
My life is blazing  
Burning fast-way too fast  
Hey hey

I sing of power, magick and faith  
A sonnet of pure victory  
A hymn to the spirits of freedom and grace  
And whichever gods there may be  
Manacled, beaten, blackened and burned  
Cast from the light of the goal  
I'll never falter, stumble or kneel  
Thanks to the strength of my soul  
  
Lashed by the winds of fate  
Stung by the gods of hate  
I'm rising in power, I'm rising unchained  
Call this a sacred vow  
All that I tell you now  
I may be bloody, but I am unbowed  
I am power  
  
Harken the hour, season and day  
Phantom of dark misery  
Summon your demons, hunger and hate  
Spirit of impurity  
Ravaged by fire, stripped and enslaved  
Torn from the world that I know  
I'll never cry out, buckle or kneel  
I am the king of my soul  
  
Stung by the gods of wrath  
Blinded by circumstance  
I'm rising in power, I'm rising unchained  
All that I tell you now  
Sure as a sacred vow  
I may be bloody, but I am unbowed  
  
Die, fall on your sword, fall on your knees  
Die like your son nailed to his tree  
Die by my hand, die by my sword  
Right on this site, vultures defile  
  
Die, fall on your sword, fall on your knees  
Die in the sun nailed to these trees  
Die by my hand, die in my heart  
Flung from the heights, forever fall  
  
I sing of power, magick and might  
A sonnet of pure victory  
A hymn to the fearless, the savage, the brave  
The spirit of our liberty  
Total my debts, tally my sins, charge each offence on my scroll  
I'll never alter the course of my steele, I am the king of my soul  
  
Lashed by the winds of fate  
Stung by the gods of hate  
I'm rising in power through murdering rain  
Stronger than faith allows  
Braver than hero's vows  
My head is bloody, but I am unbowed  
I am power  
Power

Father forgive them for they know not what they are doing  
  
Break this bread and drink the wine  
just remember with whom you dine  
do this in memory of me, when I'm not among you all  
Peter you will deny me, Judas you will betray  
last supper, it's your last supper  
  
Open wide the Gates to receive me  
high above the clouds there is peace  
after 3 days I will rise again to teach you all  
Mary you'll see me first, you others will fall amazed  
last supper, it's your last supper  
  
When the sun no longer turns thr skies are black  
darkness like a breathing hand upon your back  
they wlll kill the shepherd to divide the sheep  
but remember this forever I reign, forever I reign  
  
So damn the dark the light  
the tears you cry tonight  
damn your love your lies  
promises you broke woe  
this is your last mistake, it's written in the sand  
the law reveals itself, shining like the sun  
forever I reign, forever I reign  
  
Supper!!!  
break this bread and drink the wine  
just remember with whom you dine  
will you remember me when I'm not among you now  
Peter you still deny me, Judas you will betray  
last supper, it's your last supper  
it is finished.

Lying and cheating  
Taking all I can get  
Always wanting more  
It's time to even the score  
  
Winners and losers  
Always come and go  
As soon as I get it  
I gotta let it go  
  
I can hear you say  
I can hear you say!  
  
Ladies of the night  
Give me what you've got  
I ain't looking for love  
Just want some action!  
  
We're headed for a life of crime  
Keep running till the day we die  
We're headed for a life of crime  
But it's too late now  
We've already crossed the line!  
  
This nowhere train you're riding  
Is going nowhere fast  
You better watch your step  
Or you're gonna burn in hell!  
  
I can hear them say  
I can hear them say!  
  
We're headed for a life of crime  
Keep running till the day we die  
We're headed for a life of crime  
But it's too late now  
We've already crossed the line!

Roaring against the dying light  
The lion stands alone  
Caught in the spell of winter dreams  
He'll not give up his throne  
Chain the earth and chain the sun  
Break the hourglass  
Make the stars fall into line  
Suspend the end of time  
No, not tonight  
I'll not give in without a fight  
And I'll rage against this wind  
For even a moment more of the day  
I will...  
  
[Chorus:]  
Run proud, run free  
Never set the sun on me  
Race hard play mean  
Anger's the symphony of screams  
A thousand roses on the hill  
A thousand lips to taste  
The darkness breathes a hateful sigh  
Goes forth to murder dreams  
Voices crying cold and dark  
My name is in the sky  
Shadows lenghten, sun sinks low  
The trees are frozen gold  
I won't give in!!!

On the bridge of hades, searching for a sign  
On the brink of knowledge, there's no time  
Shadow of the horseman who is sworn to rise  
Seven are now waiting in the skies warring angels forage  
Scavengers of pain I am born to power  
Courage is my name  
  
Rise on the wings of truth  
To the sun we know that forever lives inside  
Mind, body, spirit  
All are one  
  
Rising like a tower, fortune's torch revives  
Slicing every rule that will divide  
Who will hold the red queen when misfortune cries  
Seven bands are waiting in the sky  
Murder and fire and pain is the  
Sign swollen with power your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know  
  
Rise on the wings of doom to the sun  
We know that forever lives inside  
Mind, body, spirit, all are one  
Mind, body, spirit, all are one  
  
Prizing only valor numen steal the  
Light on the brink of knowledge  
Burning bright shadow of the  
Horseman who is sworn to rise  
Sin and death are waiting in the  
Skies murder and fire and pain is the  
Sign swollen with power your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know  
  
Rise on the wings of death, to the sun  
We know that forever lives inside  
  
I see my vision, I see the line  
Circling onward, looking for nine  
I know the answer is not to be found  
Searching in darkness with eyes of the blind  
And in the morning,  
Two will remain  
To carry us onward, to guard the flame  
That we know  
There'll be time, for all, for all  
We don't need you, we're fine on our own  
We don't want you, leave us alone  
Fortune is fire as numen we  
Shine invoking the power, your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know the mind is a tower  
The body sublime the soul is the power, your  
Blood is my wine  
And I know  
Leave us alone

Animal, grace in form and power  
Dignity, a conscious thought  
The judgement hour  
  
To live in honor  
Quoting freedom's name  
A noble stance  
Bearing a proudful mane  
Noble savage!  
  
Hope is born, a changeling dawn  
Bringing strange power  
Transform, change form  
Blend mind and matter  
  
A voice of reason crying in the dark  
A raging fire from a spark  
Breathe through me  
  
I'm a savage, I'm a king  
I fought deceivers  
I conquered evil  
  
Animal, grace in form and power  
Dignity,a conscious thought  
The judgement hour  
  
A voice of reason crying in the dark  
A divine vision from the heart  
Breathe through me  
  
I'm a savage, I'm a king  
I fought deceivers  
I conquered evil  
  
Innocent eyes, shine down on me  
Don't, don't, don't blind your eyes to me  
I'm here with you  
Always, again today  
Can you feel me?  
I'm with you  
Never, never surrender  
Oh, the power, the glory is yours  
My kingdom, on high, again  
Can you see?  
I'm with you now...

When the dark is complete  
And the day goes to sleep  
That's when I come alive  
Faster than shadows  
On the wings of the night I'll be by your side  
  
And my soul spreads wide its raven wings  
And I cover you tonight  
Ooh you won't need no other  
I'm your dangerous lover, oh babe you know it's true  
  
I want to feel you in the dark  
I want to kiss your body  
I want to make you mine!  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ride on the wings of the night  
(You know you want to)  
Ride on the wings of the night  
(You're old enough to)  
Ride on the wings of the night  
(I'm coming for you)  
  
And they tell you I'm wild  
That I'm the devil's child  
I'll only make you cry  
They say you're too young to feel  
They say my love's a lie  
  
But they don't know what it does to me  
Just to have you in my arms  
I'll introduce you to life's forbidden delights  
I'll make you a woman of you  
  
We Ride!  
Midnight, hearts collide  
Naked alone, your body's mine  
Ooh babe, don't say no..  
  
Tonight... my virgin child come..  
I want to feel you in the dark...

WE SUMMON THE SONS OF ANU,  
SPIRITS OF LIVING FIRE!!!  
  
In the night we gather for the slaying of the beast  
The chosen kings of fire summoned by the priests  
Lord give me strength to crush my enemies  
Their pain and their suffering will be music to my ears  
  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - wash away my pain, wash away my fate  
Let me rise up born again  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - blood runs from the sky, I'm the Lord of flies  
On the wings of hate I rise  
  
Soon it will be over abd we'll gather for the feast  
Hear the weeping of their woman as they grovel at our feet  
The gods have shown their favor, my victory is known  
Your gods have proven false, your death is mine to own  
  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - wash away my pain, wash away my tears  
Let me rise up born again  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - give power to my call, devouring their flesh  
Purify as all - RAIN OF FIRE  
  
Like a comet from hell  
devouring their flesh  
  
Trample to dust in the fire of lust  
With fire we slay all who stand in our way  
A covenant bound in the world underground  
We slash and we strike see your head on a spike  
  
Once free and so brave, now your people are slaves, oh...  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - the sons of Anu rise, the fields of blood are mine  
On a burning horse I ride  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - ravager of towns our covenant is bound  
In your kingdom underground  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - rape our enemies, burn their village bright  
In a golden wall of light  
BURNING RAIN OF FIRE - blood runs from the sky, the veils of death divide  
And the crucified arise - RAIN OF FIRE!!!  
  
Lyrics submitted by Karunga

Fire and water, victims change  
Seasons learning, nothing's gained  
Now the time has come, apparition waiting  
Before the hours of doom approaching lies  
In these hallowed halls sanctuary reach me  
Before the hour of doom's approaching lights  
  
And the dark gods awaken into the sun  
And their darkness is frozen fortunate one  
They will not heal, they now will follow  
The sacred light and sound!  
  
Angry now but you are not beaten down  
Whispered wind the verdict leaves him un-bound  
In the flowing course of time a greater honor for thee  
Will be found on the shores of my country  
Power surge echoes down from the sky  
Raise your fist, cultivate noble lives  
Clothe them now in garments dyed  
Matching gold of the sky  
Bold enough to sleep where they lie  
  
Rise up rise again after the ring of fire  
You'll see them recover their honor and grace  
Rise up ride the wind this is the end of violence  
Believe in the sunlight on this chosen night  
  
I'm returning slowly to the ground (it's resurrection day)  
Returning slowly to the ground!  
  
Rise up rise again after the reign of terror  
The skies are proclaiming the city is blest  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The moment of never on this frozen night.  
The curse walks among you.  
  
Rise up rise again after the reign of terror  
You'll see them recover the garden of life  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The bond of the goddess guards this chosen night  
  
Rise up ride the wind after the ring of fire  
The skies are proclaiming the city is blest  
Rise up ride the wind after the reign of terrord  
With fortune inside us on this dawn of night  
  
We're alive the gods arrive, the cracks of doom roll by  
Steer the course that pallas walks don't let the violence fall  
Under the spell of darkness or light  
We are proven now fortune rides on our side.  
Descend to paradise it's narrow, virgin bright  
Endless night  
  
Guide the rings of the sun, now we are all forms in one!  
  
Victory in the sunlight of union above and below  
  
Sacrosanct lords of the skies, revere the queen of remorse  
Wielding the signs of grace, the signs of faith  
And their darkness aligns with your rays!  
  
Victory, in the sunlight of union we stand!  
  
I'm returning slowly to the ground (it's resurrection day)  
Returning slowly to the ground  
To the ground!

I'm not sleepin' the walls are down  
and your hands are icy cold  
under water through che sound of fear  
comes a drowned and cold reply  
and the mist still hangs around the gallows  
like the anger after the violent rain  
  
[Chorus:]  
Die if you will die if you want to  
there's no mistake the ending is clean  
the fire is cold in the ashes of memory  
there's no escape from this hotel  
  
Like a child who lies to win  
then eats of his own flesh  
holy water can't save you now  
you've hungered far too long  
and the words once spoken  
now ring hollow as the mind that  
shatters your flesh with nails  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm not sleepin' I'm alive for you  
you, you'll try again save yourself  
the dawn takes the night, the night takes the sun  
the son takes your sins your sins can be cleansed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No escape the ending is clean  
it doesn't have to be this way

[The Serpent to Adam and Eve:]  
"If Heaven is higher and death is a dream  
Cast away virtue it's not what it seems  
In whiteness descending the souls steals a star  
Creates a new Heaven in sin where you are"  
[The Serpent to Cain:]  
"Sons of Cain, agonize, bring forth then die  
Your children will multiply- tear Heaven down...  
With a Serpent's kiss, with a Serpent's kiss..."  
[The Serpent to Eve (in turn, Eve to Adam):]  
"Black superstition, denied by your sire  
The golden elixir- Promethean fire  
Quick is unguarded delight in its taste  
Indulge in your passion, be quick, make haste."  
[The Serpent to Mankind:]  
"Sons of pain, agonize, bring forth then die  
Your sorrows will multiply and you shall share my fall..."  
[Voice of Adam:]  
"Eve we were mistaken to listen to his words  
Black heart and false fatal guile  
Now judgement is swift, his wrath is profound  
Eden is lost to us now  
Driven to wander in sorrow and shame  
Immortal no longer we blame you!!!"  
[The Serpent's reply:]  
"Bastards, forsaken cast from his grace  
Bask in the light of my fall  
Now suffer and weep, my hatred runs deep  
The jaws of regret smite you all  
From out of the mire, the filth and the fire  
My legions, my furies unbound!!!  
I'm no longer waiting, my eyes are not blind  
My arrows streaming, carve a path through the light"  
[Voice of God:]  
"Now you listen, now you learn of fathomless night  
Cast down in wrath, cast down in flame, olympian might  
Chained to Earth, my kongdom comes first  
Down with you, into the fire!!"  
[The Serpent's reply:]  
"Wailing, screaming, roaring loud, my reign begins  
'Tis better to rule than merely to serve  
My hate will bring down Elysian stones... Taste the Serpent's Kiss....  
The Serpent's Kiss...."  
[The Serpent's to himself:]  
"If Heaven is higher and death is a dream  
Cast away virtue it's not what it seems  
In whiteness descending the soul steals a star  
Creates a new Heaven in sin where you are"  
[The Serpent to Cain:]  
"Sons of Cain, agonize, bring forth then die  
Scale the walls of heaven now, and bring God to his knees  
With a Serpent's kiss, Serpent's kiss... Serpent's kiss..  
God shall share my fall!!!"

Hurling down with thunder from on high  
An ancient evil steals across the sky  
Flaming power, death is in his wake  
The lord of Hell returns to rend and rape  
  
Watch the lights as they devour you  
A blazing presence rips you through and through  
Blinded by such beauty caught so unaware  
You're stripped and burning in his fiery stare  
  
Howling furies, shrieking backwards lies  
Phantom armies summoned by their cries  
Nothing equals this astounding sight  
Of the beast unveiled in this unholy light  
  
Watch the lights as they devour you  
A blazing presence rips you through and through  
Blinded by such beauty caught so unaware  
You're stripped and burning in his fiery stare  
  
Angel of light, descends to the Earth  
To challenge the might of the son  
The angel of light, descends on the Earth  
To take back the crown from the One  
  
No mercy doth the dragon bring  
Harken now his beating wings  
Fire dances on the air  
The seventh serpent leaves his lair  
Invoking all the hounds of Hades  
The shrouded angels meet his gaze  
Spouting flame upon the wise  
The legions steal into the skies  
To fly, to fly  
  
Crashing, burning, locked in wars embrace  
The desolate one meets with his fiery fate  
His armies smitten by the sword of him  
Our lord of lords, the holy king of kings  
  
No more fear of phantoms of the night  
Rejoice in the city of unending light  
No more tears of dying  
On his throne he's shining  
Raise the chalice for eternity  
  
Angel of light descends on the Earth  
And dies by the roar of the lamb  
The angel of light, descends on the earth  
And is crushed by the might of the lamb

Marching across the desert sands  
Condemned to drift from land to land  
No food or water or heaven's rain  
So many tears and so much pain  
It's a long road the nights are so cold  
A thousand miles from my home  
Now the wasteland becomes our homeland  
There is no peace for those who roam...roam  
  
They call them the chosen ones  
But that's just a lie  
They call them the chosen ones  
Yet so many die  
If they're the chosen ones  
Under the sky  
Who made them the chosen ones  
To suffer and die  
Only the pain here now is real...so real  
  
Swords and arrows cannot defame  
When they invoke thy masters name  
The north star beckons beyond the gate  
To live in strife is their only fate...oh  
A thousand miles but I still roam....still I roam!!!  
A promise foretold, the armies can't hold  
The burning secrets on the scroll...still I roam...burn!  
  
They call them the chosen ones  
But that's just a lie  
They call them the chosen ones  
Yet so many die  
If they're the chosen ones  
Under the sky  
Why must these chosen ones  
Suffer and die...  
Only the pain here now is real...march!  
A million miles away  
Oh...my god why have you forsaken me  
Oh...we'll never understand  
  
They call them the chosen ones  
But that's just a lie  
They call them the chosen ones  
Yet so many die  
If they're the chosen ones  
Under the sky  
Who made them the chosen ones  
To suffer and die...  
Only the pain here now is real...march! March!  
(Across the desert...burning sand...black sun...no rain...  
Burning in the sand...burn)  
Only the pain, only the pain, only the pain keeps us alive  
The pain, the pain keeps us alive!!!  
We'll never understand...

ELEKTRA:  
Cursed by the Priests, torn, twisted and beat  
Sentenced to die, by the Sorceress-her Evil Eye

Soaring high above the desert  
far beyond the shifting plains I call your name  
With a love that goes beyond love  
past the prison of all time In the sky you and I  
  
From the Dawn of all Creation  
to the pain of Nevermore  
Can you hear me in your slumber  
As I Haunt the Nightly shore  
  
Chorus:  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
  
In the Palace of the Spirits  
where the streets are still and strange, I stand alone  
13 moons reveal the sadness  
where your mortal body drained  
In the sky ou and I, we can't die  
  
From the Dawn of all Creation  
Calling from the other side  
None can ever tear asunder  
our love is sanctified  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Fly Phantom of Night, Vulture Divine send me Lenore  
  
From the Dawn of all Creation  
Calling from the other side  
None can ever tear asunder  
our love is sanctified  
  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
When the Light of Life is over calling from the other side  
Unleash the Raven fly to me  
Unleash the Raven fly to me

Like the talon of Mars I'll tear right through the wall  
Thunder and lightning in power the gods reveal all  
In the black where the siren reigns  
Ravaging the spirits of the brave  
  
The wine of violence, breaks our control  
See the madness, burning angels glow  
The wine of violence, I steal your soul  
See the madness in me grow  
  
I am the wound and the scar and the spear come to life  
Sacred red son of the sun, torn to pieces imbibed  
In the black where the darkness rains death  
Drowning in the currents of your shame  
  
The wine of violence, takes your control  
Sin and madness burning kingdoms whole  
The wine of violence, I steal your soul  
See the madness in me grow  
  
Fight me you coward, thief of stolen days  
Joy is destruction, driving me insane to fight  
Win the silence of the damned, holy order, high command  
Eagle tearing flesh from bone  
Golden whirlwind, bare the stars we fly! fly!  
Let the death mist close your eyes!  
  
The wine of violence, takes all control  
See the fire burning down below  
The wine of violence, I steal your soul  
See the god in me enthroned  
  
All dead, silent and alone  
No more savior carved in stone  
All dead nobody will weep  
Icy water, death runs deep... vengeance is mine... I regain my halls...

Never say ?never'  
Keep both your eyes on the flame  
The power that lies within you  
Comes forth once again  
  
Onward through darkness  
Envisions the diamonds beyond  
Through burning, deceit and corruption  
The dream still lives on  
  
And you're standing there  
Raise your hands  
Split the air- tonight!  
Action call to arms  
  
I'm fighting for eternity  
For honor, for grace and for glory  
Immortality  
Layer by layer  
  
By mortar, by rampart, by stone  
A fortress, a haven for love  
I can call my own  
And you're standing there...  
  
Raise your hands  
Split the air...  
And dream for tomorrow  
Take my hand, we'll be free  
  
Ancient kingdoms in the sunset  
In the darkness of our years  
Never fade  
And you're standing there...  
  
Raise your hands  
Split the air...  
And dream for tomorrow  
Take my hands, cross the sea  
  
Rainbow castles in the distance  
Emerald sands beckon me  
Come to me, come to me  
Heed the voice that is calling  
  
Come to me, come to me  
For thy kingdom  
Awaits your crowning  
Come to me...

Ask and you won't be forgiven  
This is a blessing in disguise  
All of your choices are spoken  
You've killed the child in my eyes  
I'm gonna see you burn  
  
When in some dark distant future  
you'll meet my presence in a song  
You'll punch the walls in frustration  
Can you hear my voice and say I'm wrong?  
I'm gonna see you burn  
  
With the first light I touch your skin  
rise above the challenge, the day begins  
and the brightnessss runs to black  
fading in the darkness I'm not coming back  
  
Here we live and here now we die  
on this mountainside  
arms entwined, the chosen the brave  
fire wind to take you away like the wrath of God  
  
Ask and you won't be forgiven  
This is a blessing in disguise  
All of your choices are spoken  
You've killed the child in my eyes  
I'm gonna see you burn

Flashing metal, I jumped in the fray  
  
Feel the bite, hear the scream  
We fear no evil  
Helped by hands unseen  
With a voice, like the wind  
Seven trumpets sound the chords of dreams, now  
  
In mountain caverns deep, the molten flames would leap.  
The virgin metal was thrust in the forge  
Its power works for those  
Whose dreams of peace still hold  
The skies rejoice the coming day.  
  
Gonna shout, gonna scream  
The stacks of glory, sweetly sing their praise  
Gonna shout, gonna scream, shake the world  
And let them know we're here.

The sun will rise  
Our golden prize  
No shadow fall  
Upon our lives  
The sands of time  
Won't fall for us  
No ash to ash, no dust to dust  
Eternal summer waits for us  
Our bodies bronze, we thirst, we lust  
The changes of the years, won't touch us- no!  
  
[Chorus:]  
We are eternal  
We are young, we are strong  
We are immortal, the life force is in our hands  
On we go through seas of time  
We hear the voive, we drink the wine  
I build, you burn, then one forgets  
The evils of the innocent  
A face of wonder, a heart will cry  
The stain of death upon her eyes  
A moment caught in time  
I'm alive!  
  
[Chorus]  
We are eternal  
We are immortal  
We are the flame that never dies!  
We are eternal  
We are immortal  
We'll never die!

Lift Your Voices Up  
Raise The Roof Now  
We Are Coming  
There's No Stopping Us  
Here we go!  
  
Let The Creatures of pray  
Raise a clamor round your ears  
Cursing, screaming voices full of fear  
Of fear!  
  
It's a tale of the fool  
Designed to weaken you  
Full of sound and fury  
And jealous lies  
It tries-but I'm free!  
  
Wings of vengeance draw nigh  
Wings of vengeance on high  
  
[Chorus]  
We rule the night  
We rule the night  
We rule the night  
You and I  
  
Marching on to victory  
Your path is paved with scars  
A victim of illusion  
You shoot far- so far  
Oh, but your reach  
Should always exceed your your grasp  
Or what's a heaven for  
But to last- to last  
Die free!  
  
Wings of vengeance draw nigh  
Wings of vengeance on high  
  
[Chorus]

In the Valley of Dying Stars  
as the Gods dream their angry dreams  
Restless Spirits, thoughts arise  
from the porcelain shuttered rooms  
they shift and glide  
The Dawn becomes lighter  
for the Weeping of the Spirits Crystallize  
  
Welcome my friend I know your face well  
I know the mark that you wear  
Your Father's eyes watch from afar  
I know the gift that you bear, for we are one  
  
Thunder and Blood rage on the wind  
Spirits of Vengeance collide  
Brother of mine, Tyrant of air  
I see the gift that you bear  
For we are one  
For we are one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Ride like the wind in chains of defiance  
I see the scars and the pain  
Shatter the ground I stand beforr you  
Kill me or die where you stand  
  
Ten thousand sons, scream through the wind  
Burning the Angels alive  
Shining in chains, Blood stains the air  
I know the mark that you wear  
For we are one  
For we arc one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ride like the wind in chains of defiance  
I see the scars of the pain  
Shatter the ground, the Spirits Alliance  
I see the whips and the stain  
Ride like the wind in chains of defiance  
I see the work of your name  
Shatter the ground I stand before you  
Kill me or die where you stand  
Die where you stand!!!!

Hold me, take me in your arms one last time  
I can't bear the thought of your leaving  
This night oh so black  
The starts don't shine  
And you're never, never coming back...  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you running to now  
Where are you running to now  
Oh babe  
Where are you running to now  
Where are you running to now  
Oh yeah  
  
Silence,  
I'll never hear your sweet voice in my ear  
Just a lonely sound as you disappear  
In the night, the clouds are black  
The starts have died  
And you're never, never coming back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you know that it's not easy?  
Don't you know that it's so hard to take?  
Where are you now, is someone with you?  
I'll have to accept that you're not coming back  
No, no more, no more, no more, no more...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Goodbye babe, so long darlin  
I'm never gonna see you again  
Goodbye babe, goodbye babe
