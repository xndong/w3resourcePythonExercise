It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around  
a little me to fill up with my thoughts  
A little me or he or she to fill up with my dreams  
a way of saying life is not a loss  
  
I'd keep the tyke away from school and tutor him myself  
keep him from the poison of the crowd  
But then again pristine isolation might not be the best idea  
it's not good trying to immortalize yourself  
  
Beginning of a great adventure  
Beginning of a great adventure  
  
Why stop at one, I might have ten, a regular TV brood  
I'd breed a little liberal army in the wood  
Just like these redneck lunatics I see at the local bar  
with their tribe of mutant inbred piglets with cloven hooves  
  
I'd teach 'em how to plant a bomb, start a fire, play guitar  
and if they catch a hunter, shoot him in the nuts  
I'd try to be as progressive as I could possibly be  
as long as I don't have to try too much  
  
Beginning of a great adventure  
Beginning of a great adventure  
  
Susie, Jesus, Bogart, Sam, Leslie, Jill and Jeff  
Rita, Winny, Andy, Fran and Jet  
Boris, Bono, Lucy, Ethel, Bunny, Reg and Tom  
that's a lot of names to try not to forget  
  
Carrie, Marlon, Mo and Steve, La Rue and Jerry Lee  
Eggplant, Rufus, Dummy, Star and The Glob  
I'd need a damn computer to keep track of all these names  
I hope this baby thing don't go too far  
  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me, hey  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
  
She says, "Baby, it's the beginning of a great adventure"  
"Babe, beginning of a great adventure"  
take a look  
  
It might be fun to have a kid that I could kick around  
create in my own image like a god  
I'd raise my own pallbearers to carry me to my grave  
and keep me company when I'm a wizened toothless clod  
  
Some gibbering old fool sitting all alone drooling on his shirt  
some senile old fart playing in the dirt  
It might be fun to have a kid I could pass something on to  
something better than rage, pain, anger and hurt  
  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
I hope it's true what my wife said to me  
She says, "Lou, it's the beginning of a great adventure"  
"Lou, Lou, Lou, beginning of a great adventure"  
She says, "babe, how you call your lover boy"  
"Sylvia, quite you call your lover man"  

In Berlin, by the wall  
You were five foot ten inches tall  
It was very nice  
Candlelight and Dubonnet on ice  
  
We were in a small cafe  
You could hear the guitars play  
It was very nice  
It was paradise  
  
You're right and I'm wrong  
Hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day  
  
Oh, you're right and I'm wrong  
You know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day  
One sweet day  
  
In a small, small cafe  
We could hear the guitars play  
It was very nice  
Candlelight and Dubonnet on ice  
  
Don't forget, hire the vet  
He hasn't had much fun yet  
It was very nice  
Hey honey, it was paradise  
  
You're right and I'm wrong  
Hey babe, I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day  
You're right, oh, and I'm wrong  
You know I'm gonna miss you now that you're gone  
One sweet day, one sweet day  
  
One sweet day  
One sweet day, oh, one sweet day  
One sweet day, baby, baby, one sweet day ...  

Betrayed, by the one who says she loves you  
By the one who says she needs you - above all other men  
Betrayed, by her fragile, vicious beauty  
Her father did his duty and I lie down betrayed  
  
Justice taught her confidence, her mother was like steel  
Her cousins, they're all convicts  
She alone rose above that wheel  
But a motorcyclist, no matter how good  
Is slave to the oncoming truck  
And the poison of her father was her most pitiless luck  
  
Betrayed, by the one who says she loves you  
By the one who says she needs you - above all other men  
Betrayed, by her fragile, vicious beauty  
Her father did his duty and I lay down betrayed  
  
Three of us lie in his bed - night of infamy  
One of us lies on our back - her father's in her head  
And quick she turns and slaps my face  
And with her eyes open wide she screams  
I hate you, I hate you, I hate you  
But she's looking right by me  
  
Betrayed, by the one who says she loves you  
By the one who says she needs you - above all other men  
Betrayed, by her fragile, vicious beauty  
Her father did his duty and I lie down betrayed  

Billy was a good friend of mine  
We grew up together ever since we were nine  
We went to school, he was my best friend  
And I thought our friendship would never end  
  
In highschool he played football  
And me, I didn't do anything at all  
He made touch-downs, while I played pool  
And no one could figure out, which one of us was the fool  
  
Then we both went to collage  
He studied medicine, while I studied foilage  
He got "A's", and I got "D's"  
He was going for his P.H.D.  
The I decided to drop out  
Then I decided to drop out  
Things were getting a little to hot  
  
Billy stayed there, became an intern, then a doctor  
Then war broke out and he had to go  
But not me, I was mentally unfit or so they say, so, so  
  
When he came back, he wasn't quite the same  
His nerves were shot, but not me  
Last time I saw him, I couldn't take it anymore  
He wasn't the Billy I knew, it was like talking to a door  
  
Billy was a friend of mine  
I grew up with him ever since we were nine  
We went together to school  
And now I often wonder, which one of us was the fool

Who's that peeping through my door  
Sneaking up and down the hall  
I can't stand it anymore  
I can't stand it anymore  
Who's that peeping through my door  
Sneaking up and down the hall  
I can't stand it anymore  
I can't stand it anymore  
Blind rage, I'm in a blind rage  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
  
Who's that creeping in my room  
Blocking out the stars and moon  
I fear you will attack me soon  
Who goes there!!!  
  
Who's that creeping in my room  
Blocking out the stars and moon  
I fear you will attack me soon  
Who goes there!!!  
  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
I'm in a blind rage  
  
Blind rage you're making me scared  
You're making me scared  
Blind rage  
  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
  
Blind rage  
Blind rage  
I'm in a blind rage

I'm cruising fast on a motorcycle  
down this winding country road  
And I pass the gravel on the foot of the hill  
where last week I fell off  
  
There's still some oil by the old elm tree  
and a dead squirrel that I hit  
But if I hadn't left, I would have struck you dead  
so I took a ride instead  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
  
My doctor says, she hopes I know  
how lucky I can be  
after all it wasn't my blood  
mixed in the dirt that night  
  
But this violent rage, turned inward  
can not be helped by drink  
And we must really examine this and I say  
I need another drink  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
  
I'm tearing down Route 80 east  
the sun's on my right side  
I'm drunk, but my vision's good  
and I think of my child bride  
And on the left in shadows  
I see something that makes me laugh  
I aim that bike at the fat pothole  
beyond that underpass  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out  
Bottoming out  
bottoming out

I'd like to sing you a Broadway song  
I hope that you'll all sing along  
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your  
Mind at ease  
  
I'd like to play you something low and sexy  
Look at our dancers they're so young and pretty? Hi Olga!  
And when we start to groove you can hear the  
Saxophones blow  
  
Ah show business it's just a wonderful thing  
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing  
  
For you  
And let the saxophones blow  
Blow baby, blow  
  
I'd like to sing you a Broadway song  
I hope that you'll all sing along  
A little dancing and some sentiment to put your  
Mind at ease  
  
I want to bring a tear to your eye  
Awww good old Poe don't he make you cry  
Ain't it great the way he writes about the  
Mysteries of life  
  
Ah show business is just a wonderful thing  
All I want is to get down on my knees and sing  
  
For you  
And let the saxophones blow  
Blow baby, blow  
Go goose, go.

You're the kind of person that I've been dreaming of  
You're the kind of person that I always wanted to love  
And when I first seen you walk right through that bar door  
And I seen those suit and tie johns buy you one drink  
And then buy you some more I had a -  
  
I know you had that crazy feeling  
Now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling  
You know that I've had that crazy feeling, too  
I can see it in your ..  
You got that crazy feeling  
Now, now, now, now, now, you got that crazy feeling  
I've had that crazy feeling, too  
  
Now everybody knows that business ends at three  
And everybody knows that after hours love is free  
And you, you really are a queen  
Oh, such a queen, such a queen  
And I know, 'cause I made the same scene  
I know just what you mean  
Because you got that crazy feeling  
Now, now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling  
You got that crazy feeling deep inside  
Now, I can see it in your eyes  
You got that crazy feeling  
Now, now, now, now, you're got that crazy feeling  
And you got that crazy feeling, too  
I feel just like, feel just like you  
Crazy feeling ...

He was lying banged and battered, skewered and bleeding  
Talking crippled on the Cross  
Was his mind reeling and heaving hallucinating  
Fleeing what a loss  
  
The things he hadn't touched or kissed his senses  
Slowly stripped away  
Not like Buddha not like Vishnu  
Life wouldn't rise through him again  
  
I find it easy to believe  
That he might question his beliefs  
The beginning of the Last Temptation  
Dime Story Mystery  
  
The duality of nature, Godly nature,  
Human nature splits the soul  
Fully human, fully divine and divided  
The great immortal soul  
  
Split into pieces, whirling pieces, opposites  
Attract  
From the front, the side, the back  
The mind itself attacks  
  
I know the feeling, I know it from before  
Descartes through Hegel belief is never sure  
Dime Store Mystery, Last Temptation  
  
I was sitting drumming thinking thumping pondering  
The Mysteries of Life  
Outside the city shrieking screaming whispering  
The Mysteries of Life  
  
There's a funeral tomorrow  
At St. Patrick's the bells will ring for you  
Ah, what must you have been thinking  
When you realized the time had come for you  
  
I wish I hadn't thrown away my time  
On so much Human and so much less Divine  
The end of the Last Temptation  
The end of a Dime Store Mystery

I was angry  
I said things I shouldn't say  
But please don't turn your back  
Sometimes I get so upset  
But I take it all back  
Please don't go  
I know I was wrong  
Sometimes I don't know what comes over me  
But I try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Don't hurt a woman  
I was angry  
I said things I shouldn't say  
I must have lost control  
Sometimes something clicks in my head  
And I'm not myself anymore  
That wasn't me  
You can't believe everything you see  
Let's make believe I never said a word  
And I'll try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
I'll try to remember  
Don't hurt a woman  
Cause I lovin' you  
So long

They call you ecstasy  
Nothing ever sticks to you  
Not Velcro, not Scotch tape  
Not my arms dipped in glue  
  
Not if I wrap myself in nylon  
A piece of duct tape down my back  
Love pierced the arrow with the twelve  
And I can't get you back  
  
Ah, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
Ah, ecstasy  
  
Across the streets an old ford, they took off it's wheels  
The engine is gone  
In it's seat sits a box  
With a note that says, goodbye charlie, thanks a lot  
  
I see a child through a window with a bib  
And I think of us and what we almost did  
The Hudson rocketing with light  
The ships pass the statue of liberty at night  
  
They call it ecstasy, ah  
Ecstasy  
Ecstasy, ah  
Ecstasy  
  
Some men call me st. ivory  
Some call me St. Maurice  
I'm smooth as alabaster  
With white veins runnin' through my cheeks  
  
A big stud through my eyebrow  
A scar on my arm that says, domain  
I put it over the tattoo  
That contained your name  
  
They called you ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
They call you ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
  
The moon passing through a cloud  
A body facing up is floating towards a crowd  
And I think of a time and what I couldn't do  
I couldn't hold you close, I couldn't, I couldn't become you  
  
They call you ecstasy, I can't hold you down  
I can't hold you up  
I feel like that car that I saw today, no radio  
No engine, no hood  
  
I'm going to the cafe, I hope they've got music  
And I hope that they can play  
But if we have to part  
I'll have a new scar right over my heart  
I'll call it ecstasy  
  
Oh, ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy  
Ecstasy, ecstasy  
Ecstasy

The bias of the father runs on through the son  
And leaves him bothered and bewildered  
The drugs in his veins only cause him to spit  
At the face staring back in the mirror  
  
How can he tell a good act from the bad  
He can't even remember his name  
How can he do what needs to be done  
When he's a follower not a leader  
  
The sickness of the mother runs on through the girl  
Leaving her small and helpless  
Liquor files through her brain with the force of a gun  
Leaving her running in circles  
  
How can she tell a good act from the bad  
When she's flat on her back in her room  
How can she do what needs to be done  
When she's a coward and a bleeder  
  
The man if he marries will batter his child  
And have endless excuses  
The woman sadly will do much the same  
Thinking that it's right and it's proper  
  
Better than their mommy or their daddy did  
Better than the childhood they suffered  
The truth is they're happier when they're in pain  
In fact, that's why they got married

Jealousy, endlessly  
Sweeps through my mind  
Jealousy, often causes me to  
Be unkind  
  
I'm sorry I said that  
I'm sorry I did that  
I'm sorry I hit you  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Being endlessly jealous of me  
The man that you thought I could be turning red  
With jealousy  
  
Endlessly jealousy  
Eats through my skull  
Endlessly jealousy  
Makes me feel dull  
  
Fighting  
Endless jealous fighting  
I feel my fingers tightening  
Tightening, please don't break her arm  
  
Jealously thinking of you  
Of your endless possession of me  
Of my jealousy, endlessly, jealousy, endlessly  
Jealous of you  
  
Sorry, running to a phone to say  
I'm sorry, running out of dimes  
The phone on the street spits at me  
Have a good day  
  
Sorry, please you know how I am sorry  
I've been this way for  
Oh, so long, endlessly, zealously  
Jealous of you  
  
Jealousy, endlessly  
Eats through my mind  
Jealousy, endlessly  
Makes me be unkind  
  
I'm sorry I said that  
I'm sorry I did that  
I'm sorry I hit you  
I'm sorry, I'm sorry  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Being endlessly jealous of me  
Endlessly jealous of you being endlessly  
Jealous of me  
  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you  
Endlessly jealous of you

All the things you said - you thought I was dead  
Everything made me feel aware  
Ah, you're getting old, you're doing things  
You're losing your hair  
All the things that you used to believe in  
Turned out to be true - you're guilty of reason  
  
You're the kind of person that I could do without  
And certain kinds of money would make you see what it's all about  
There's a first time for everything  
There's a first one's on me, don't you see  
  
All of the things that your old lover said  
Look at them, they jump out of windows  
And now they're just dead  
It's the truth, don't you realize  
  
Faded without any talent of fun  
Running out in the streets, balling everyone  
It's the truth, It's the truth  
  
Pick up the pieces that make up your life  
Maybe some day you'll have a wife and them alimony  
Oh, can't you see

[King:]  
Oh mellifluous dwarf  
Prince of all the jesters  
Funny little thing you are  
Make me laugh  
As God's voluminous star  
[Hop Frog:]  
Gracious majesty  
Today is not made for laughter day  
This moment sacred is more for royal sunsets  
Then comic ruin or suicidal jests  
[King:]  
I'll be the judge of that thank you  
Make me laugh le petite cur  
Drink some wine  
Lest you foul sweet time  
[Hop Frog:]  
Drink upsets me  
Please your liege  
This would mark the death me  
[King:]  
I said drink you scabrous whore  
Are you deaf as well as short?  
[Tripitena:]  
Kingdom's Sire  
Big as you are  
Save such  
Bile for larger foes  
[King:]  
Make me laugh  
'Fore I stretch your neck like a giraffe

(how's the family)  
(how's the family)  
Mama, you tell me how's the family  
And papa, tell me how thing's going by you  
And little baby sister, I heard that you got married  
And I heard that you had yourself a little baby girl, too  
And here's some uncles and some cousins I know vaguely  
And would you believe my old dog chelsea's here, too  
And would you believe nobody in this family  
Wanted to keep her  
And now that dog's more of a part of this family  
Then I am, too  
I don't come home much anymore  
No-no-no I don't come home much anymore  
Mama  
And mama, I know how disappointed you are  
And papa, I know that you feel the same way, too  
And no-no-no-no-no I still haven't got married  
And no-no-no there's no grandson planned here for you  
And by the way, daddy tell me how's the business  
I understand that your stock she's growing very high  
No, daddy, you're not a poor man anymore  
And I hope you'll realize that before you die  
Because I don't come home much anymore  
No-no-no-no-no I don't come home much no more  
But daddy  
And please-please-please-please-please  
Come on let's not start this business again  
I know how much you resent the life that I have  
But one more time, I don't want the family business  
Don't want to inherit it upon the day that you die  
Really, daddy should have given it to my sister  
You know elisabeth, you know elisabeth  
She has a better head for those things than I  
She lives practically around the corner  
That's really the kind of child you could be proud of  
But papa, I know that this visit's a mistake  
There's nothing here we have in common, except our name  
And families that live out in the suburbs  
Often make each other cry  
And I don't think that I'll come home much anymore  
No-no, I don't think I'll come home much again  
Mama  
Papa  
Families  
Often make each other cry  
No, I don't think that I'll come home much anymore  
(how's the families)  

Wind blows snow outside my windows  
Crowd below runs wild in the streets  
Two rented brothers race down two separate alleys  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Down in the train yard out by the stockyard  
Butchers with aprons hack meat in the snow  
Blood has the brothers pulsing with envy  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Two rented brothers. Their faces keep changing  
Just like these feelings I have for you  
And nothing's forever not even five minutes  
When you're headed for the finish line  
  
Down in the depot out by the meat rack  
Down by the tunnels surrounding the jail  
Prisoners are marching in squares and in circles  
They're heading for the finish line  
  
They're lining up for Noah's Ark  
They're stabbing each other in the dark  
Saluting a flag made of some rich guy's socks  
Heading for the finish line  
  
Close to the line the ice is cracking  
Two rented feelings sitting in the stands  
Two mothers, two fathers and both of them are paid for  
All of a sudden it comes back to me  
  
Just up ahead is the finish line  
Two rented referees and two checkered rags  
Out of the corner of my eye comes a  
Dark horse with black wings  
Headed for the finish line  
  
I'm five years old the room is fuzzy  
I think there's also a very young girl  
It's hard to remember what happened exactly  
As I'm staring at the finish line  
First came fire then came light  
Then came feeling then cane sight  

I would not run from the holocaust  
I would not run from the bomb  
I'd welcome the chance to meet my maker  
And fly into the sun, fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd break up into million pieces and fly into the sun  
  
I would not run from the blazing light  
I would not run from its rain  
I'd see it as an end to misery  
As an end to worldly pain  
An end to worldly pain ...  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
To end this worldly pain  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd shine by the light of the unknown moment  
And fly into the sun  
  
The earth is weeping, the sky is shaking  
The stars split to their core  
And every proton and unnamed neutron  
is fusing in my bones  
And an unnamed mammal is darkly rising  
As man burns from his tomb  
And I look at this as a blissful moment  
To fly into the sun  
  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd burn up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun  
To end this mystery answer my mystery  
I'd look at this as a wondrous moment  
To end this mystery  
Fly into the sun, fly into the sun  
I'd break up into a million pieces  
And fly into the sun

He's over by the corner  
Got her hand by her side  
They hit her harder, harder, harder  
Till they thought she might die  
  
Well, I've got a foggy notion, do it again  
Oh, over by the corner, do it again

Like the lion tears the flesh off of a man  
So can a woman who passes herself off as a male  
They sang "Danny Boy" at his funeral and the Lord's Prayer  
Preacher talking 'bout Christ betrayed  
It's like the earth just opened and swallowed him up  
He reached too high, was thrown back to the ground  
You know what they say about bein' nice to the right people on the way up  
Sooner or later you gonna meet them comin' down  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Hear ya got a brother named James, don't forget faces or names  
Sunken cheeks and his blood is mixed  
He looked straight into the sun and said revenge is mine  
But he drinks, and drinks can be fixed  
Sing me one more song, about ya love me to the moon and the stranger  
And your fall by the sword love affair with Erroll Flynn  
in these times of compassion when conformity's in fashion  
Say one more stupid thing to me before the final nail is driven in.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
There's a retired businessman named Red, cast down from heaven and he's out of
his head  
He feeds off of everyone that he can touch  
He said he only deals in cash or sells tickets to a plane crash  
He's not somebody that you play around with much  
Miss Delilah is his, a Philistine is what she is  
She'll do wondrous works with your fate  
Feed you coconut bread, spice buns in your bed  
If you don't mind sleepin' with your head face down in a grave.  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Well they'll choose a man for you to meet tonight  
You'll play the fool and learn how to walk through doors  
How to enter into the gates of paradise  
No, how to carry a burden too heavy to be yours  
Yeah, from the stage they'll be tryin' to get water outta rocks  
A whore will pass the hat, collect a hundred grand and say thanks  
They like to take all this money from sin, build big universities to study in  
Sing "Amazing Grace" all the way to the Swiss banks  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
They got some beautiful people out there, man  
They can be a terror to your mind and show you how to hold your tongue  
They got mystery written all over their forehead  
They kill babies in the crib and say only the good die young  
They don't believe in mercy  
Judgment on them is something that you'll never see  
They can exalt you up or bring you down main route  
Turn you into anything that they want you to be  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back  
  
Yes, I guess I loved him too  
I can still see him in my mind climbin' that hill  
Did he make it to the top, well he probably did and dropped  
Struck down by the strength of the will  
Ain't nothin' left here partner, just the dust of a plague that has left this
whole town afraid  
From now on, this'll be where you're from  
Let the dead bury the dead. Your time will come  
Let hot iron blow as he raised the shade  
  
Well, there ain't no goin' back when your foot of pride come down  
Ain't no goin' back

Born on a farm in a transatlantic moonlight  
Split like a cord of wood my family broke up  
Sold like a piece of steer, a piece of meat, a cow  
A breathing piece of shit  
  
Picked for my age, for my strength and make up  
Called for I was tall, I was big, I could hold up  
A tree or a piece of steel I could do  
What my fat owner can't  
  
Ah, future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
  
Ah  
I'm always watching the way his wife looks me over  
I have a sex twice as big as her husband's  
If I wasn't so large, so strong, so pale  
I'd disappear under a bush  
Colorless men and ladies of the world unite  
Kill your master with one cut of your knife  
Kill them during sex, kill them during talk  
Kill them whenever you can  
  
Future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
Future farmers of America  
  
These -  
Stupid black owners are foreigners to affairs of the heart  
Look at me, I'll never own land that I work on  
Every one of us here shares a surname  
This father must die  
  
I was born on the dark cusp of twilight  
My father was dark, my mother was light  
Look at me, I'm strong  
I could crush him in my fist  
  
Ah  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my fist  
  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my  
I could crush him in my fist  
  
Future farmers of America  
I could crush him in my fist  
Future farmers of America  
I could crush him in my fist  
Future farmers of America  
I could crush him in my fist

Well, you covered your tracks  
And now I can't see you  
You had your ashes scattered at sea  
There's no grave to visit, no tombstone to look at  
You were in the New York Times obituary  
There's no record, no tape, no book, no movie  
Some photographs and some memories  
Sometimes I dial your phone number by mistake  
And this is what I hear:  
This is no longer a working number, baby  
Please redial your call  
This is no longer a working number  
Your party doesn't live here anymore  
This is no longer a working number  
If you still require help  
Stay on the line, and an operator  
Will try to bail you out  
I knew I should have seen you that Thursday  
I knew I shouldn't have left  
But you sounded so good, your spirits so up  
I thought I'd see you next week  
I say over and over if I had half a brain  
If I had half a brain in my head  
I wouldn't sit here, dialing a wrong number  
And listening to what some recording said  
I knew I should have written, written things down  
I always say I'll never forget  
Who can forget a one-eyed pilot?  
Who's a concert pianist?  
A painter, a poet, songwriter supreme  
My friends are blending in my head  
They're melting into one great spirit  
And that spirit isn't dead  
Now, I may not remember everything that you said  
But I remember all the sings you've done  
And not a day goes by, not an hour  
When I don't try to be like you  
You were gassed, stoked, and rarin' to go  
And you were that way all the time  
So I guess you know why I'm laughing at myselves  
Every time I dial the wrong line  
This is no longer a working number, baby

Hey, if that ain't the rock'n'roll animal himself, what you doing bro.  
(Standing on the corner)  
Well, I can see that, what you got in your hand  
(Suitcase in my hand)  
No, shit, what's this  
(Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest)  
Fucking faggot Johnson  
(Jack, sweet Jane, I'm in a rock'n'roll band)  
Well, I can see that  
  
Some people say that you can't - (no no no)  
No matter how good you are  
And some people say, they can't move - (no no no)  
No matter where they are  
  
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some good times  
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some pain  
No matter how ugly you are  
You know to me it all looks the same  
  
Rain from the morning in the blue clouds  
Now just shining up with dew  
Riding through the city in their big cars  
And me, I ain't got nothing to do  
  
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some good times  
Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some pain  
Don't you know things always look ugly  
To me they always look the same  
  
Oh, gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some good times  
Oh, Gimmie, gimmie, gimmie some pain  
Don't you know that most things look ugly  
To me they always look the same  
  
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know  
To me they always look the same  
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know  
To me they always look the same  
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know  
To me they always look the same  
Oh, don't you know, hey, don't you know  
To me they always look the same

When you're in a dream,  
And you think you've got your problems all nailed down.  
Pieces of the scheme  
Seem to rattle up and to rattle down.  
  
And when you start to fall,  
And those footsteps, they start to fade.  
  
Then you know you're going down.  
Yeah, you're falling all around.  
And you know you're going down  
For the last time.  
  
When you're in the air,  
And you're thinking you'll drift off into the rest.  
Your friends politely advise:  
Hey, look, you're pushing too hard,  
And perhaps you need a rest.  
  
And when you start to fall,  
And all those footsteps, they start to fade.  
  
Then you know you're going down.  
Yeah, you're crashing upside down.  
And you know you're going down  
For the last time.  
  
Time's not what it seems.  
It just seems longer, when you're lonely in this world.  
Everything, it seems,  
Would be brighter if your nights were spent with some girl  
  
Yeah, you're falling all around.  
Yeah, you're crashing upside down.  
Oh, oh, and you know you're going down  
For the last time.

Good evening Mr.Waldheim  
and Pontiff how are you?  
You have so much in common  
in the things you do  
  
And here comes Jesse Jackson  
he talks of Common Ground  
does that Common Ground include me  
or is it just a sound  
  
A sound that shakes  
oh Jesse, you must watch the sounds you make  
  
A sound that quakes  
there are fears that still reverberate  
  
Jesse you say Common Ground  
does that include the PLO?  
what about people right here right now  
who fought for you not so long ago?  
  
The words that flow so freely  
falling dancing from your lips  
I hope that you don't cheapen them  
with a racist slip  
  
Oh Common Ground  
is Common Ground a word or just a sound  
Common Ground  
remember those civil rights workers buried in the ground  
  
If I ran for President  
and once was a member of the Klan  
wouldn't you call me on it  
the way I call you on Farrakhan  
  
And Pontiff, pretty Pontiff  
can anyone shake your hand ?  
or is it just that you like uniforms  
and someone kissing your hand  
  
Or is it true  
the Common Ground for me includes you too  
  
Oh, oh, is it true  
the Common Ground for me includes you too  
  
Good evening Mr.Waldheim  
pontiff how are you  
as you both stroll through the woods at night  
I'm thinking thoughts of you  
  
And Jesse you're inside my thoughts  
as the rhythmic words subside  
my Common Ground invites you in  
or do you prefer to wait outside  
  
Or is it true  
the Common Ground for me is without you  
  
Or is it true  
the Common Ground for me is without you  
  
Oh is it true  
there's no Ground Common enough for me and you  

Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
Let me tell you, now, goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
  
Ah, all night long you've been drinking your tequilla rye  
But now you've sucked your lemon peel dry  
So why not get high, high, high and  
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
  
Goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye  
Goodnight sweet ladies, all ladies goodnight  
It's time to say goodbye, bye-bye  
  
Ah, we've been together for the longest time  
But now it's time to get high  
Come on, let's get high, high, high  
And goodnight ladies, ladies goodnight  
  
Oh, I'm still missing my other half  
Oh, it must be something I did in the past  
Don't it just make you wanna laugh  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
Oh, nobody calls me on the telephone  
I put another record on my stereo  
But I'm still singing a song of you  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
  
Now, if I was an actor or a dancer that was glamorous  
Then, you know, an amorous life would soon be mine  
But now the tinsel light of star break  
Is all that's left to applaud my heart break  
And eleven o'clock I watch the network news  
  
Oh, oh, oh, something tells me that you're really gone  
You said we could be friends, but that's not what's not what I want  
And, anyway, my TV-dinner's almost done  
It's a lonely Saturday night  
I mean to tell you, it's a lonely Saturday night  
One more word, it's a lonely Saturday night

Guilty, guilty  
Guilty, I'm paralyzed with guilt  
It runs through me like a rain through silk  
Guilty, my mind won't leave me alone  
My teeth are rotted  
My lips start to foam  
Cause I'm so guilty  
Guilty, guilty  
Ooohhh guilty  
What did I say  
What did I say  
What did I do  
Did I ever do it to you  
Don't turn your back, ah  
I can't look you in the eye, ah  
Eye eye eye eye  
I guess I'm guilty as charged  
I guess I'm guilty as charged  
Guilty, huh, guilty ah, guilty ah, guilty  
Guilty guilty guilty guilty guilty  
Don't do that  
Don't do that  
Don't do what  
  
Oh you're such a child  
Real fool child  
Guilty  
What can I do  
I do it to you  
But I do it to me too  
  
Cut off my head  
Cut off my head  
Cut off my head, ah  
Hang me from the yardarm  
Guilty, I'm paralyzed with guilt  
I've got bad thoughts  
I've got an evil clit  
  
Guilty  
  
Guilty, my mind won't leave me alone  
I've got a bad mind  
I've got a bad bone  
Guilty guilty guilty as charged  
Guilty  
Don't do that  
Don't do what  
Don't do that  
Oh you're such a reckless child  
You remember when you were a baby  
Do you remember when you were a baby  
Do you have a jury, yeah  
Do you have a verdict  
Guilty as charged  
Guilty guilty guilty as charged  
Do you have a verdict  
Do you have a verdict  
I'm guilty  
You're guilty  
Oh you're such a reckless child  
I should beat you  
I should hit you  
I'll put you in therapy, ah

Heavenly arms reach out to hold me  
Heavenly arms entice you to dance  
In a world of ill will, the dancers are still  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Heavenly arms, soft as a love song  
Heavenly arms bring a kiss to your ear  
In a world that seems mad, all the dancers seem sad  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia,  
Heavenly arms come to my rescue  
Only a woman can love a man  
In a world full of hate, love should never wait  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Heavenly arms, strong as a sunset  
Heavenly arms, pure as the rain  
Lovers stand warned of the worlds impending storm  
Heavenly arms reach out to me  
  
Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia, Sylvia  
  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)  
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)  
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)  
(Sylvia, you mean so much to me)  
(Heavenly arms reach out to hold me)

Listen, I just wanna tell you a story  
It happened to a friend of mine  
Didn't have no power in the glory  
City took a hell of a time??  
The city was ahead kind of pushing  
The only thing this about this girl  
She went and she married another fellow  
Knocked my friend right out of this world  
He heard the preacher say here comes the bride  
(here comes the bride)  
Here comes the bride, baby  
(here comes the bride)  
?  
(here comes the bride)  
She looked lovely, here comes the bride  
Somebody called to say they caring  
Tell her that a refugee is coming in Philmont via the coast  
Somebody call up his old man  
Hey, tell him his son is a writer and?? Looking like a ghost  
And somebody find that Virgin Mary  
Oh, won't you tell that bitch, hey your two bees are coming back home  
Somebody tell those ladies in waiting, hold it now  
Don't tell the preacher, go on with it  
We don't want to hear the words  
Here comes the bride (here comes the bride)  
I don't want to hear it, here comes the bride (here comes the bride)  
Here comes the bride (here comes the bride)  
Looks so lovely, so lovely, so lovely,  
Don't you know the preacher looks so lovely, yeah yeah  
Here comes the bride (here comes the bride)  
(here comes the bride)

I don't know just where I'm going  
But I'm goin' to try for the kingdom if I can  
'cause it makes me feel like I'm a man  
When I put a spike into my vein  
Then I tell you things aren't quite the same  
  
When I'm rushing on my run  
And I feel just like jesus' son  
And I guess I just don't know  
And I guess that I just don't know  
  
I have made very big decision  
I'm goin' to try to nullify my life  
'cause when the blood begins to flow  
When it shoots up the dropper's neck  
When I'm closing in on death  
  
You can't help me not you guys  
All you sweet girls with all your sweet talk  
You can all go take a walk  
And I guess I just don't know  
And I guess I just don't know  
  
I wish that I was born a thousand years ago  
I wish that I'd sailed the darkened seas  
On a great big clipper ship  
Going from this land here to that  
I put on a sailor's suit and cap  
  
Away from the big city  
Where a man cannot be free  
Of all the evils in this town  
And of himself and those around  
Oh, and I guess I just don't know  
Oh, and I guess I just don't know  
  
Heroin, be the death of me  
Heroin, it's my wife and it's my life  
Because a mainer to my vein  
Leads to a center in my head  
And then I'm better off than dead  
  
When the smack begins to flow  
Then I really don't care anymore  
About all the jim-jims in this town  
And everybody putting everybody else down  
And all of the politicians makin' crazy sounds  
All the dead bodies piled up in mounds, yeah  
  
Wow, that heroin is in my blood  
And the blood is in my head  
Yeah, the god's good as dead  
Ooohhh, God that I'm not aware  
I just don't care  
And I guess I just don't know  
And I guess I just don't know

There's blacks with knives and whites with guns  
fighting in Howard Beach  
There's no such thing as human rights  
when you walk the N.Y. streets  
A cop was shot in the head by a 10 year old kid named Buddah in  
Central Park last week  
The fathers are lined up by  
the coffins by the Statue of Bigotry  
You better hold on something's happening here  
You better hold on---meet you in Tompkins Square  
The dopers sent a message to the cops last weekend  
They shot him in the car where he sat  
And Eleanor Bumpres and Michael Stewart must have appreciated that  
There's a rampaging rage rising up like a plague of bloody vials  
washing up on the beach  
It'll take more than the Angels or Iron Mike Tyson  
to heal this bloody breach  
A junkie ran down a lady a pregnant dancer  
she'll never dance but the baby was saved  
He shot up some China White and nodded out at the wheel  
and he doesn't even remember a thing  
They shot that old lady  
'cause they thought she was a witness  
to a crime she didn't even see  
Whose home is the home of the brave by the Statue of Bigotry  
You got a black .38 and a gravity knife  
You still have to ride the train  
There's the smelly essence of N.Y. down there  
but you ain't no Bernard Goetz  
There's no Mafia lawyer  
to fight in your corner  
for that 15 minutes of fame  
The have and the have nots are bleeding in the tub  
That's New York's future not mine  
Oh you better hold on---something's happening here.  

You broke my heart and you made me cry  
You said that I couldn't dance  
But now I'm back to let you know  
That I can really make romance  
You do what you gotta do  
You do everything you can  
You do what you want to do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne  
You do anything once  
You try anything twice  
You so what you gotta do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne, hey, hey  
Do what you want to do  
You do what you can  
You do what you want to do  
But I love you, Suzanne  
I love you when you're good  
Baby, I love you when you're bad  
You do what you gotta do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne  
Do what you want to do  
Hey, baby, do what you can  
You do what you want to do, baby  
But I love you, Suzanne  
I know you, try anything once, baby  
You try anything twice  
Do what you gotta do  
But I love you, Suzanne  
I love you when you're good, baby  
I love you when you're bad  
Do what you want to do  
Ooohhh, but I love you, Suzanne, hey, hey  
Hey, I love you, Suzanne  
I love you, Suzanne  
I love you, Suzanne  
Oh, sweet  
Do what you want to do  
Hey, you do what you can  
You do what you want to do  
Hey, but I love you, Suzanne  
You try anything once  
You do anything twice  
Do what you want to do  
You know that I love you, Suzanne

I remember you  
I remember me  
I remember  
I remember how things used to be  
I remember every word that you said  
I remember, how could I forget?  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)  
  
I remember you  
I remember your old address  
And I remember  
How could I forget?  
I remember thinking how my luck changed  
I remember being so amazed  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)  
  
I remember you  
I remember me  
I remember  
The way things used to be  
I remember how it was that we met  
I remember  
I will never forget  
I remember  
I remember you  
(I remember, I remember)

I want to be black  
Have natural rhythm  
Shoot twenty feet of jism, too  
And fuck up Jews  
I want to be black  
I want to be a Panther  
  
Have a girlfriend named Samantha  
And have a stable of foxy whores  
Oh I want to be black  
  
[Chorus:]  
I don't want to be a fucked up, middle class,  
College student anymore  
I just want to have a stable of foxy little whores  
Yeah, yeah I want to be black  
  
I want to be black  
I want to be like Martin Luther King  
And get myself shot in spring  
And lead a whole generation too  
And fuck up the Jews  
  
I want to be black, I want to be like Malcolm X  
And cast a hex over President Kennedy's tomb  
And have a big prick, too  
  
[Chorus]

Under the intense scrutiny of Ligeia's eyes  
I have felt the full knowledge  
And force of their expression  
And yet been unable to possess it  
And have felt it leave me  
As so many other things have left  
The letter half read  
The bottle half drunk  
Finding  
Finding in the commonest objects of the universe  
A circle of analogies  
Of metaphors  
Ooohhh  
For that expression  
Which has been willfully  
Withheld from me  
The access to the inner soul denied  
  
I want to know, ooohhh  
I want to know  
I want to know, oh  
I want to know  
  
In consideration  
In consideration of the faculties and impulses  
Of the human soul  
Of the human soul  
In consideration  
Of our arrogance  
Of our arrogance  
Our radical, primitive irreducible arrogance of reason  
We have all overlooked the propensity  
We saw no need for it  
The paradoxical something which we may call perverseness  
Perverseness  
Through its promptings we act without  
Comprehensible object  
We act for the reason we should not  
We act for the reason we should not  
For certain minds this is absolutely irre-, irre-  
Irresistible  
Irresistible  
The conviction of the wrong  
Or impolicy of an action  
Is often the unconquerable force  
The unconquerable force  
It is a primitive impulse  
It is a primitive impulse  
Primitive impulse  
The overwhelming tendency  
The overwhelming tendency to do  
Wrong for the wrong's sake  
To do wrong for the wrong's sake  
We persist in acts  
Because we feel that we  
Should not persist in them  
Because we feel we, feel we  
Should not persist, per-, persist in them, ah  
Ooohhh  
  
So I want to know  
I want to know  
I want to know  
I want to know  
  
I want to, I want to know  
I want to, I  
Ooohhh, we persist in action  
We persist in action  
Wrong, wrong, wrong, wrong  
Ooohhh  
Wrong, wrong  
Oh we persist in action  
Ah yeah yeah  
When you know that it's wrong

Hey, pretty baby  
Don't you think you might give me a chance  
Get it on with me  
Go down-town for some loving romance  
And I know I ain't nothing  
I ain't worth but a thin dime  
But if you put your heart in my hands  
I'm sure that I could change your mind  
  
I want to boogie with you  
Yeah, I want to boogie with you  
  
There's something, baby, on which your parents  
Both agree  
And that is that they both have a  
Deep distrust for me  
And your best friend Frankie  
Well, I know, your best friend Frankie, he wants to see me sink  
And I don't much blame him for that  
He gets so useless after so few drinks, you know, baby  
  
I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you  
  
Well, I know your little baby sister  
She thinks that I'm a flop  
Well, I guess that you know that it's true  
I spent more time at the bottom than the top  
Tell your little sister  
I know she wants to give me a whirl  
But I don't have the time, baby  
To wait till she's grown up, and she's a woman, not a girl  
  
Don't you know, I want to boogie with you  
Hey, I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you  
I want to boogie with you, yeah  
  
Boogie with you  
Down by the corner  
We'll be able to, yeah

Yes I am mother nature's son  
And I'm the only one  
I do what I want and I want what I see  
Huh, could only happen to me  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Oh, please, Saint Germaine  
I have come this way  
Do you remember the shape I was in  
I had horns that bent  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Do you remember the silver walks  
You used to shiver and I used to talk  
Then we went down to Times Square  
And ever since I've been hanging around there  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Yes I am mother nature's son  
And I'm the only one  
I do what I want and I want what I see  
Could only happen to me  
  
I'm so free  
I'm so free  
  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Early in the morning, I'm so free  
Late in the evening, I'm so free  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free  
When I feel good, I'm so free  
When it's in the morning, I'm so free  
When it's in the evening, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
Feel so good, now, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so free  
Oh, oh, oh, I'm so free  
Feel so good, now, I'm so free  
Feel little nice, I'm so free  
Feel little down, now, I'm so free  
You're so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free  
I'm so free, I'm so free

I'm waiting for my man  
Got 26 dollars in my hand  
Up to lexington 125  
Feel sick and dirty more dead than alive  
Huh, I'm waiting for my man  
  
Hey white boy, what you doin' uptown  
Hey white boy, you chasin' my women around  
Pardon me sir, it's furthest from my mind  
I'm just waitin' for a dear-dear friend of mine  
I'm waiting for my man, come on  
  
Here he comes, he's all dressed in black  
Pr shoes and a big straw hat  
He's never early, he's always late  
First thing you learn is that you always gotta wait  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Up to a brownstone, up three flights of stairs  
Everybody's pinned you and nobody cares  
He's got the works, gives you sweet taste  
Then you gotta split because you got no time to waste  
I'm waiting for my man  
  
Hey baby, don't you holler, don't you ball and shout  
I'm feeling good, I'm gonna work it on out  
I'm feeling good, feeling so fine  
Until tomorrow, but that's just some other time  
I'm waiting for my man  
I'm waiting for my man  
I'm waiting for my man  
Man-man-man-man-man-man-man

In our sleep, as we speak  
Listen to the drum's beat, as we speak

Listen to the drum's beat, in our sleep  
  
In our sleep, as we speak  
Listen to the drum's beat, as we speak

I think you're, oh, so beautiful  
I think you're so kind  
And I think I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
And I think of an apple core  
When you start thinking of God  
  
And I know I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
And I think you're so beautiful  
Beautiful as the blackened space and stars  
But all I see is a coreless seed  
When you cry for a God who's not there  
  
And I think you're so beautiful  
And I see you're as the sun  
That shines out through these galaxies  
Shimmering and warm, ah  
  
And I think you're so beautiful, oh, oh, oh, oh  
And if there's one thing I believe at all  
It's how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
It's how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
It's how much I would miss you  
If you disappear into the divine  
  
How much, how much  
How much, how much  
How much, how much  
How much, how much, how, how much  
If you disappear into the  
How much, how much  
(How much), hey, hey, hey, hey  
  
How much

It wasn't me who shamed you, it's not fair to say that  
You wanted to work I gave you a chance at that  
It wasn't me who hurt you, that's more credit than I'm worth  
Don't threaten me with the things you'll do to you  
  
It wasn't me who shamed you, it wasn't me who brought you down  
You did it to yourself without any help from me  
It wasn't me who hurt you, I showed you possibilities  
The problems you had were there before you met me  
  
I didn't say this had to be  
You can't blame these things on me  
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me  
I know she's dead, it wasn't me  
  
It wasn't me who changed you, you did it to yourself  
I'm not an excuse for the hole that you dropped in  
I'm not simple minded but I'm no father to you at all  
Death exists but you do things to yourself  
  
I never said give up control  
I never said stick a needle in your arm and die  
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me  
I know he's dead but it wasn't me  
  
It wasn't me who shamed you, who covered you with mud  
You did it to yourself without any help from me  
You act as if I could've told you or stopped you like some god  
But people never listen and you know that that's a fact  
  
I never said slit your wrists and die  
I never said throw your life away  
It wasn't me, it wasn't me, it wasn't me  
You're killing yourself - you can't blame me  

You keep your jealousy and your snide remarks to yourself  
You know that I'm not seeing anyone else  
You just keep your ear down to the ground  
Yell your head off if you hear a sound  
Here's a whistle, a badge and a phone  
You can arrest me if I'm not at home  
And if I don't keep my word I swear  
I'll keep away  
  
Here's some books and a puzzle by Escher  
Here's Shakespeare's "Measure For Measure"  
Here's a balloon, a rubber band and a bag  
Why don't you blow them up if you think you've been had  
Here's a castle, a paper dragon and a moat  
An earring, a toothbrush and a cloak  
And if I don't keep my word I swear  
I'll keep away  
  
I swear I'll keep away

All your two-bit psychiatrists are giving you electro shock  
They say, they let you live at home, with mom and dad  
Instead of mental hospital  
But every time you tried to read a book  
You couldn't get to page 17  
'Cause you forgot, where you were  
So you couldn't even read  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
They're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Until they run run run run run run run run away  
  
Mom informed me on the phone  
She didn't know what to do about dad  
Took an axe and broke the table  
Aren't you glad you're married  
And sister, she got married on the island  
And her husband takes the train  
He's big and he's fat and he doesn't even have a brain  
They're gonna kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Until they run away  
  
Creedmore treated me very good  
But Paine Whitney was even better  
And when I flipped on PHC  
I was so sad I didn't even get a letter  
All of the drugs, that we took, it really was lots of fun  
But when they shoot you up with thorizene on crystal smoke  
You choke like a son of a gun  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill your sons  
Don't you know, they're gonna kill, kill your sons  
They're gonna kill, kill your sons  
Until they run run run run run run run run away  

They say he didn't have an enemy  
His was a greatness to behold  
He was the last surviving progeny  
The last one on this side of the world  
He measured half a mile from tip to tail  
silver and black with powerful fins  
They say he could split a mountain in two  
That's how we got the Grand Canyon  
Some say they saw him at the Great Lakes  
Some say they saw him off the coast of Florida  
My mother said she saw him in Chinatown  
but you can't always trust your mother.  
Off the Carolinas the sun shines brightly in the day  
The lighthouse glows ghostly there are night  
The chief of a local tribe had killed a racist mayor's son  
and he'd been on death row since 1958  
The mayor's kid was a rowdy pig  
spit on Indians and lots worse  
The old chief buried a hatchet in his head  
life compared to death for him seemed worse  
The tribal brothers gathered in the lighthouse to sing  
and tried to conjure up a storm or rain  
The harbor parted and the great whale sprang full up  
and caused a huge tidal wave  
The wave crushed the jail and freed the chief  
The tribe let out a roar  
The whites were drowned  
the browns and reds set free  
but sadly one thing more  
Some local yokel member of the NRA  
kept a bazooka in his living room  
and thinking he had the chief in his sights  
blew the whale's brains out with a lead harpoon  
Well Americans don't care for much of anything  
land and water the least  
And animal life is low on the totem pole  
with human life not worth much more than infected yeast  
Americans don't care too much for beauty  
They'll shit in a river, dump battery acid in a stream  
They'll watch dead rats wash up on the beach  
and complain if they can't swim  
They say things are done for the majority  
Don't believe half of what you see  
and none of what you hear  
It's a lot like what my painter friend Donald said to me  
"Stick a fork in their ass and turn them over, they're done"  

Everybody's gonna try to tell you what to do  
And never, never, never, never  
Let it be said that it's true  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone  
Leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me, leave me alone  
  
They're the kind of people that'll always let you down  
I know you, too, you don't ever give it a frown  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...  
  
Don't you know some people  
They just don't know when to stop  
They can't tell the floor from the ceiling or the top  
And there're other types, they always make you wait  
And they're always the first to say  
The state you come from  
  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...  
Love me, love me, love me, love me, love me forever  
Love me, love me, love me...  
  
Leave me, leave me, leave me...

Legendary hearts  
Tearing up apart  
With stories of their love  
Their great transcendent loves  
While we stand here and fight  
And lose another night  
Of legendary love  
  
Legendary loves  
Haunt me in my sleep  
Promises to keep  
I never should have made  
I can't live up to this  
I'm good for just a kiss  
Not legendary love  
  
Romeo, oh, Romeo, wherefore art thou Romeo?  
He's in a car or at a bar  
Or churning his blood with an impure drug  
He's in the past and seemingly lost forever  
  
He worked hard at being good  
But his basic soul was stained not pure  
And when he took his bow  
No audience was clapping  
  
Legendary hearts  
Tear us all apart  
Make our emotions bleed  
Crying out in need  
No legendary love  
Is coming from above  
It's in this room right now  
  
And you've got to fight  
To make what's right  
You've got to fight  
To make what's right  
You've got to fight  
To make what's right  
You've got to fight to keep your legendary love

Men of good fortune, often cause empires to fall  
While men of poor beginnings, often can't do anything at all  
The rich son waits for his father to die  
The poor just drink and cry  
And me I just don't care at all  
  
Men of good fortune, very often can't do a thing  
While men of poor beginnings, often can do anything  
At heart they try to act like a man  
Handle things the best way they can  
They have no rich daddy to fall back on  
  
Men of good fortune, often cause empires to fall  
While men of poor beginnings, often can't do anything at all  
It takes money to make money they say  
Look at the Fords, but didn't they start that way  
Anyway, it makes no difference to me  
  
Men of good fortune, often wish that they could die  
While men of poor beginnings want what they have  
And to get it they'll die  
All those great things that live has to give  
They want to have money and live  
But me, I just don't care at all  
  
Men of good fortune  
Men of poor beginnings  

Sometimes I feel so happy  
Sometimes I feel so sad  
Sometimes I feel so happy  
But mostly you just make me mad  
Baby, you just make me mad  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
Thought of you as my mountain top  
Thought of you as my peak  
A thought of you as everything  
I've had, but couldn't keep  
I've had, but couldn't keep  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
Skip a life completely  
Stuff it in a cup  
They said, Money is like us in time  
It lies, but can't stand up  
Down for you is up  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
It was good what we did yesterday  
And I'd do it once again  
The fact that you are married  
Only proves you're my best friend  
But it's truly, truly a sin  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
  
If I could make the world as pure  
And strange as what I see  
I'd put you in a mirror  
I'd put in front of me  
I'd put in front of me  
  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes  
Linger on your pale blue eyes

Just a perfect day  
Drink Sangria in the park  
And then later  
When it gets dark, we go home  
  
Just a perfect day  
Feed animals in the zoo  
Then later  
A movie, too, and then home  
  
Oh, it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Oh, such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
Just a perfect day  
Problems all left alone  
Weekenders on our own  
It's such fun  
  
Just a perfect day  
You made me forget myself  
I thought I was  
Someone else, someone good  
  
Oh, it's such a perfect day  
I'm glad I spent it with you  
Oh, such a perfect day  
You just keep me hanging on  
You just keep me hanging on  
  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow  
You're going to reap just what you sow

I was visited by the power and the glory  
I was visited by a majestic hymn  
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky  
Electricity flowing through my veins  
  
I was captured by a larger moment  
I was seized by divinity's hot breath  
Gorged like a lion on experience  
Powerful from life  
  
(I wanted all of it, all of it, all of it)  
All of it  
(Not just some of it, all of it, all of it)  
All of it  
  
I saw a man turn into a bird  
I saw a bird turn into a tiger  
I saw a man hang from a cliff by the tips of his toes  
In the jungles of the Amazon  
  
I saw a man put a redhot needle through his eye  
Turn into a crow and fly through the trees  
Swallow hot coals and breathe out flames  
And I wanted this to happen to me  
  
(I wanted all of it, all of it, all of it)  
All of it  
(All of it, all of it, all of it)  
Not some of it  
  
We saw the moon vanish into his pocket  
We saw the stars disappear from sight  
We saw him walk across water into the sun  
While bathed in eternal light  
  
We spewed out questions waiting for answers  
Creating legends, religions and myths  
Books, stories, movies and plays  
All trying to explain this  
  
(I wanted all of it, oh, all of it)  
All of it  
(All of it, oh, all of it)  
Not some of it  
  
I saw a great man turn into a little child  
The cancer reduce him to dust  
His voice growing weak as he fought for his life  
With a bravery few men know  
  
I saw isotopes introduced into his lungs  
Trying to stop the cancerous spread  
And it made me think of "Leda And The Swan"  
And gold being made from lead  
  
The same power that burned Hiroshima  
Causing three legged babies and death  
Shrunk to the size of a nickel  
To help him regain his breath  
  
And I was struck by the power and the glory  
I was visited by a majestic Him  
Great bolts of lightning lighting up the sky  
As the radiation flowed through him  
  
(I wanted all of it, not just some of it, all of it)  
He wanted all of it  
(All of it, all of it, all of it)  
He wanted all of it, not some of it

Lovely day, the sunshine  
A light of love, love divine  
As time strode away  
  
A test of love, I bring to you my love  
Like a bird who builds your unborn a home  
Full of warmth, I give to you the same test of love  
Revien cherie, revien cherie  
  
Sitting all alone in a daze  
I sing a song to you my love  
I wish I were dead  
My love was far away  
  
A test of love, I bring to you my love  
Like a bird who builds your unborn a home  
Full of warmth, I give to you the same test of love  
Revien cherie, revien cherie  
  
Life to me is a share  
To be, to see, to understand each other  
To love one another  
I give to you the same test of love  
Revien cherie, revien cherie, revien cherie

Looking for another chance for someone else to be  
Looking for another place to ride into the sun  
  
Ride into the sun, ride into the sun  
Ride into the sun ride into the sun  
Where -  
  
everything seems so pretty  
But if you're tired and you're sick of the city  
Remember that it's just a flower, made out of clay  
Oh, the city  
  
Where everything seems so dirty  
But if you're tired and you're filled with self-pity  
Remember that you're just one more person who's there  
  
It's hard to live in the city  
It's hard to live in the city, oh - oh - oh  
It's hard to live in the city, oh - wow - wow  
It's hard to live in the city  

Sit yourself down  
Bang out a tune on that grand piano  
Sit yourself down  
Lay languidly down upon that sofa  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When your heart is made out of ice  
  
Ride, Sally, ride  
It's not your time or way of confusion  
Ride, Sally, ride  
'Cause if you don't, you'll get a contusion  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When your heart is made out of ice  
  
Sit yourself down  
Take of your pants, don't you know this is a party  
Sit yourself down  
Why do you think we brought all these people, miss brandy  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When you find your heart's made out of ice  
  
Ride, Sally, ride  
It's not your time, it's just your confusion  
Ride, Sally, ride  
It's not your time, you'll get a contusion  
  
Ooh, isn't it nice  
When you find your heart is made out of ice  
  
(Ride, sally ride)  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Ride, Sally, ride  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Hey, ride, Sally, ride  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride) Ride, sally, ride  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride, Oh-oh-oh, oh)  
(Ride, ride, ride, ride, Sally ride, Hey-hey-hey, hey-hey)

She's out of her mind  
like the wind in the storm  
Oh, like the ocean in the dawn  
as it disappears, with the riptide  
  
She's out of her mind  
she's pulled away by the moon  
She's ripped from her sleep  
as the cold luna sweep gains control  
  
Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions  
Ah, ones you barely recognize  
In your sleep I heard your screaming, ooohhh  
"This is not voluntary! This is not voluntary!  
If this is life I'd rather die!"  
  
In the riptide, in the riptide  
  
She's out of her mind, riptide  
like a muscle that swells  
You know when you trip  
whether you're well or sick, your body aches  
  
She's out with the tide  
gone to a prisoner's dance  
Where a monkey's her date  
eating limbs off a plate with a spoon  
  
Ooohhh, what you gonna do with your emotions  
said the seagull to the loon  
What you gonna do with your emotions  
  
She said "Please wake me up"  
She said "Don't touch me now"  
She said "I wish I was dead"  
  
With the riptide  
  
She's out of her mind  
riptide, you always win  
It happens over and over again  
riptide  
  
She's out of her mind  
like a hurricane's rain  
She does not stand a chance  
at this luna dance, riptide  
  
I was thinking of Van Gogh's last painting  
the wheatfields and the crows  
Is that perhaps what you've been feeling  
When you see the ground  
as you fall from the shy  
As the floors disappears from beneath your feet riptide  
  
She's going out of her mind  
out with the tide  
out of her mind  
riptide  
  
She's going out of her mind  
with the riptide  
She's going out of her mind  
ah, riptide  

Staring at my picture book  
She looks like Mary, Queen of Scots  
She seemed very regal to me  
Just goes to show how wrong you can be  
  
I'm gonna stop wastin' my time  
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms  
  
Sad song, Sad song, Sad song, Sad song  
  
My castle, kids and home  
I thought she was Mary, Queen of Scots  
I tried so very hard  
Shows just how wrong you can be  
  
I'm gonna stop wasting time  
Somebody else would have broken both of her arms  
  
Sad song, Sad song, Sad song, Sad song  

Sally dances on the floor  
She says that she can't do it anymore  
She walks down St. Marks Place  
And eats natural food at my place  
  
Now Sally can't dance no more  
she can't get it off of the floor  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally, she can't dance no more  
  
Sally is losing her face  
She lives on St. Marks Place  
In a rent-controlled apartment, eighty dollars a month  
She has lots of fun, she has lots of fun  
  
But, Sally can't dance no more  
Oh Sally she can't dance no more  
She went and carried on and can't get off of the floor  
Now Sally, oh she can't dance no more  
  
She was the first girl in the neighborhood  
To wear tied-dyed pants, like she should  
She was the first girl that I've ever seen  
That had flowers painted on her jeans  
Now she wears a sword, like Napoleon  
And she kills the boys and acts like a son  
  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance no more  
Sally, hey she can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance  
Sally can't dance  
  
She knew all the really right people  
She went to Les Jardins  
She danced with Picasso's illegitimate mistress  
and wore Kenneth Lane jewels, really hey, it's trash, but  
  
Sally, can't dance no more, yeah  
Sally, she can't dance no more, you tell 'em about it  
Sally can't get herself off the floor  
Hey, Sally, girl, she can't dance no more  
Sally can't dance  
Sally can't dance  
  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)  
(Sally can't dance, Sally can't dance)  

In the science of the mind  
There is no forgiving  
Paralyzed I lay here sleeping  
Quiet as a little child  
Heart starts beating  
Blood rushing pounding  
Moving quiet as a little lamb  
  
In the science of the mind  
Limbs are bound devoid of movement  
The injuries we do in kind  
Are visited upon us often  
  
In the science of the mind  
Trying hard to move a shadow  
Don't bury me I'm still alive  
The science of the mind unyielding  
The science of the mind unyielding  
The science of the mind unyielding

When I was p poor young boy at school  
Girls like you always played me for a fool  
But now a time has come to lay to waste  
The theory people have of getting an acquired taste  
You treated me oh, so senselessly cruel  
Oh, oh, baby, you were so senselessly cruel  
From the beginnings I suspected the worst  
And you didn't disappoint me  
It was just that you were the first  
Now, I wouldn't let you touch me if you were within a foot  
And girl, I'm never ever gonna get hurt  
Cause you treated me oooh, so senselessly cruel  
Oh, so senselessly cruel, oh, so senselessly cruel

When I was a young man courting the girls  
I played me the waiting game  
If a maid refused me with a tossing curls, oh,  
I let the old earth, take a couple of whirls  
While I plied her with tears in prays of pearls  
And as time came around she came my way  
As time came around she came  
For its a long, long while, from May to December  
And the days grow short, when you reach September  
And I have the lost my tears, and the walking in the little rain  
Hey honey, I haven't gotta time for gaining Waiting Game  
And the days turn to crawl(?grow old?) as they grow few  
September, November  
And these few colden(?golden?) days I'd like to spend 'em with you  
These golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you  
And the days dwindle down to a precious few  
September, November  
And I'm not quite a quip for the waiting game  
I have a little money, and I have a little pain  
And these few golden days, as the days grow so few  
These golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you  
These precious golden days, I'd like to spend 'em with you  
September song, September song  
September song, September song

Take me for what I am a star newly emerging  
Long simmering explodes inside the self is reeling  
In the pocket of the heart, in the rushing of the blood  
In the muscle of my sex, in the mindful mindless love  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
At 5 am the moon and the sun sit set before my window  
Light glances off the blue glass we set right before the window  
And you who accept in your soul and your head  
What was misunderstood what was thought of with dread  
A new self is born the other self dead  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
A soul singer stands on the stage the spotlight shows him sweating  
He sinks to one knee Seems to cry the horn are unrelenting  
But as the drums beats he finds himself growing hard  
In the microphone's face he sees her face growing large  
And the swelling crescendo no longer retards  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  
  
As the twilight sunburst gleams  
As the chromium moon it sets  
As I lose all my regrets and set the twilight reeling  
I accept the new found man and set the twilight reeling  

All the people had their share of the glory  
Looking out after you  
It's just a story about winners and glory  
And you know that it's true  
  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
  
Some men may glory from a different condition  
Of another car  
And later persuasion would permit the arranging  
Of a ...  
And to cause more confusion, and to make this illusion  
Would have gone too far  
And it's my ambition, of a jacket ignition  
In a cadillac metal car  
  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
Ah ha, oh yeah, you're just a shooting star  
  
You're just a shooting star

I was up in the morning with the TV blarin'  
brush my teeth sittin' watchin' the news  
All the beaches were closed the ocean was a Red Sea  
but there was no one there to part it in two  
There was no fresh salad because there's hypos in the cabbage  
Staten Island disappeared at noon  
And they say the midwest is in great distress  
and NASA blew up the moon  
The ozone layer has no ozone anymore  
and you're gonna leave me for the guy next door  
I'm Sick of You  
They arrested the Mayor for an illegal favor  
sold the Empire State to Japan  
And Oliver North married William Secord  
and gave birth to a little Teheran  
And the Ayatollah bought a nuclear warhead  
if he dies he wants to go out in style  
And there's nothing to eat that don't carry the stink  
of some human waste dumped in the Nile  
Well one thing is certainly true  
no one here knows what to do  
I'm Sick of You  
The radio said there were 400 dead  
in some small town in Arkansas  
Some whacked out trucker  
drove into a nuclear reactor  
and killed everybody he saw  
Now he's on Morton Downey  
and he's glowing and shining  
doctors say this is a medical advance  
They say the bad makes the good  
and there's something to be learned  
in every human experience  
Well I know one thing that really is true  
This here's a zoo and the keeper ain't you  
And I'm sick of it, I'm Sick of You  
They ordained the Trumps  
and then he got the mumps  
and died being treated at Mt. Sinai  
And my best friend Bill  
died from a poison pill  
some wired doctor prescribed for stress  
My arms and legs are shrunk  
the food all has lumps  
They discovered some animal no one's ever seen  
It was an inside trader eating a rubber tire  
after running over Rudy Giuliani  
They say the President's dead  
but no one can find his head  
It's been missing now for weeks  
But no one noticed it  
he has seemed so fit  
and I'm Sick of it  

Friends have said to lock the door  
And have an open house no more  
The said the factory must change  
And slowly slip away  
  
But if I have to live in fear  
Where will I get my ideas  
With all those crazy people gone  
Will I slowly slip away  
  
Still there's no more billy name  
Ondine is not the same  
Wonton and the turtle gone  
Slowly slip away  
Slowly slip away  
  
If I close the factory door  
And don't see those people anymore  
If I give in to infamy  
I'll slowly slip away  
  
I know it seems that friends are right  
Hello daylight, goodbye night  
But starlight is so quiet here  
Think i'll slowly slip away  
  
What can I do by myself  
It's good to here from someone else  
It's good to hear a crazy voice  
Will not slip away  
Will not slip away  
  
If I have to live in fear  
My ideas will slowly slip away  
  
If I have to live in fear  
I'm afraid my life will slip away  
  
If you can't see me past my door  
Why your thoughts could slowly slip away  
  
If I have to lock the door  
Another life exists no more slip away  
  
Friends have said to lock the door  
Watch out for who comes through the door  
The said the factory must change  
  
But I don't

Smiles, I was taught never to smile  
I was told the stylish smiles of buffoonery  
Chicanery and larceny abound  
My mom said unless someone sticks you right in front of a camera  
A smile is the last thing that you wanna do  
Those smiles, those mirthless toothy smiles  
Smiles, they all smile on tv  
The quizmaster with his withered crones  
The talkshow hosting movie stars, the politician licking feet  
The mugger, the rapist, the arsonic lover  
All smile out from the news, at one time or another  
Those smiles, those garish sickly smiles  
When I was young my mother said to me  
Never, ever, let anyone see that you're happy  
Smiles, never, ever let them see you smile  
They'll always put you down  
With those smiles, never, ever let them see you smile  
They'll always put you down  
With your smiles, never, ever let them see you smile  
Don't you know they'll make you go  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)  
(doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo  
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo)  

She calls on the phone  
She says she doesn't want to be alone  
She says it's making her neurotic  
But please don't mistake it for being erotic  
  
So alone, so all alone  
She says let's go for a walk  
We'll have a drink and maybe we will talk  
And he thinks she has possibilities  
If she could just put away her rosary  
  
So alone, nobody wants to be alone  
But I just didn't know  
I swear to you, I just didn't know  
I would never make you sad  
If I had known I never would have  
Said those things to you  
You have to be crazy to say those things to you  
  
Let's face it I made a mistake  
Well you know, fools rush in where angels take a break  
I can't be smart all of the time  
And anyway I didn't know you were making time over him  
  
To tell you the truth, I forget all about him  
And you know, I don't think it's nice  
Asking one man about another man's vice  
I don't care if you pick my head  
As long as we end up in bed  
  
Alone, just the two of us alone  
I just didn't know  
I swear to God, I just didn't know  
Can't you understand that it's frightening  
When you hear women talking about castrating and hating men  
Who wants to know about how you hate men  
  
Well, you said now you wanted to dance  
So now we're going to dance  
You said that you weren't complete  
But we're going to put you on your feet  
You said that you were very vexed  
You told me to forget about sex  
You said you liked me for my mind  
Well, I really love your behind  
  
Oh, get up and boogie, oh baby, get up and dance  
Oh, get, get, get, get up and boogie, baby, oh, get up and dance  
Shake your booty, mama, oh, get up and dance  
  
Your points very clear  
You're not one to cry into your beer  
Why don't we go to my place  
Believe me, I'm very chaste  
And I'm so alone, ao all alone  
  
Sure all men are beasts  
Hey, look, I'll sit here quietly and I'll stare at my feet  
I don't blame you for taking umbrage  
With animals staring at your cleavage  
So alone, we're so all alone  
  
Hey, do you mind if I turn out the light  
Don't take offense, but why don't you spend the night  
I know your passions run very deep  
But at this point we both need sleep  
So alone, and who wants to be alone

Hey, some kinds of love  
Margarita told Tom  
Between thought and expression  
lies a lifetime  
Situations arise  
because of the weather  
And no kinds of love  
are better than others  
la-dee-ta-ta-ta  
  
Hey, some kinds of love  
now Margarita told Tom  
Well of course, baby, you're a bore  
but at that you're not charmless  
Because a bore is a straight line  
finds a wealth in division  
And no kinds of love  
mistaken for vision  
la-dee-ta  
  
Some kinds of love  
now Margarita told Tom  
They turn to division  
woh baby, you're not charming  
Oh baby, ....  
  
And no kinds of love  
mistaken for vision  
Put jelly on your shoulder  
oh baby, lies down upon the carpet  
Put jelly on your shoulder  
let's do what you fear most  
That from which you recoil  
but still makes your eyes moist  
Put jelly, baby, on your shoulder  
lies down, now baby, on the carpet, ooohhh  
Ooohhh-ooohhh, ooohhh  
ooohhh-ooohhh-ooohhh, ooohhh-ooohhh  
  
Well some kinds of love  
they're mistaken for vision  
  
Well I don't know, baby, what it's all about  
Oh little baby, why don't you come back  
hey, la-dee-ta-ta-ta  
Oh no Lord, ta-li-ta-li-sha  
oh now baby, la-dee-ta-ta  
Oh baby, la-dee-ta, ta-ti-ta-ti-ta  
da-ti-da-ti-ta, la-ta-ta

Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
It's making me feel mad  
Something happened, you don't hear about  
Oh, please that never did before  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
It's making me feel mad, oh  
I never saw this on tv  
I never read it in no book  
Ahh  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Hey, baby, something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
It's making me feel mad  
I thought I knew a lot of things  
But I don't know a thing, oh, oh, oh  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
The things I hear and see  
Don't seem the same  
The things I touch and feel  
Are forever changed  
I've never felt this way before  
And I hope I never do again  
Something happened  
I don't know why or when  
Oh, something happened  
I just don't understand  
Something happened  
I just don't understand  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo  
Something happened  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo  
Something happened  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo  
Something happened  
Doo, doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo

(written by Isaac Hayes - David Porter)  
  
Coming to you, on a dusty road  
Good loving, I got a truck load  
And when you get it, you got something  
So don't worry, 'cause I'm coming  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
  
Got what I got, the hard way  
and I'll make better, each and every day  
So honey, hey, don't you fret  
'cause you ain't seen nothing yet  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
  
I was brought up, on a side street  
Learned how to love, before I could eat  
Hey, I was educated, from good, good stock  
When I start loving I just can't stop  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man  
  
Grab the rope, and I'll pull you in  
Give you hope, and be your only boyfriend  
Ya, ya ya ya!  
  
I'm a soul man, I'm a soul man ...

If there's rage inside you so you cannot think  
Spit it out  
If you get so angry that you cannot speak  
Spit it out  
Talk to him, or her, or it  
And tell them where they can put it  
Spit it out, spit it out  
You got to talk to him, or her, or it  
And take aim with your mouth and spit  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
If you get worked over at your job  
Spit it out  
If a taxi almost runs you down  
Spit it out  
You got to take aim with your mouth and speak  
And give it to them right between the teeth  
Spit it out, spit it out  
Talk to him, or her, or it  
And take aim with your mouth and spit  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
If you're patient and you have the time  
Spit it out  
Wait till they're on the decline  
Spit it out  
The Chinese say you meet the hard with the soft  
The Yin with the Yang  
The down with the up, oh  
Spit it out, spit it out  
You got to grab that dumb he, she, or it  
And give it to them right between the teeth  
Spit it out, spit it out  
  
Spit it out, babe, spit it out  
Hey

Remember your manners  
Will you please take your hat off  
Your mother is dying  
Listen to her cough  
We were always standing on ceremony  
We were always standing on ceremony  
Can't you show some respect please  
Although you didn't in real life  
Your mother is dying  
And I God damn well hope you're satisfied  
We were always standing on ceremony  
We were always standing on ceremony  
So please play another song on that juke box  
Please play another pretty sad song for me  
And if that phone rings, tell them that you haven't seen me  
If that last phone rings  
Tell them that you haven't seen me for weeks  
And this one here's on me  
Standing on ceremony, standing on ceremony  
Standing on ceremony, standing on ceremony  
Standing on ceremony, you were always standing on ceremony  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
(standing, on ceremony)  
...  

Believe me, that's just a lie  
That's what she tells her friends  
There's a real song, the real song  
She won't even admit it to herself  
Narrow heart, the song let's the people know  
It's a painful song  
It'll only say the truth  
It lasts for sad songs  
Twenty for wish  
Wish it won't make it so a pretty kiss and a pretty face  
Can't have it's way  
There're tramps like us who were born to pay  
  
Love has gone away  
And there's no one here now  
And there's nothing left to way  
But, oh, how I miss him, baby  
Oh, baby, come on and slip away  
Come on, baby, why don't you slip away  
  
Love has gone away  
Took the rings of my fingers  
And there's nothing left to say  
But, oh how, oh how I need you, baby  
Come on, baby, I need you baby  
Oh, please don't slip away  
I need your loving so bad, baby, please don't slip away

Stupid man, hitchhiking out of a good life  
He says: "Catch you when ..."  
And he thinks he's got big, big planes  
Gonna build a house upon some land  
Oh, Casey, don't it make you crazy  
Oh, when you're living all alone by that damp water  
Oh, Casey, don't it make you crazy  
When you're living all alone by those still waters  
Please say hello, please say hello  
To my little baby daughter  
Oh, Casey, tell her that her father's gonna be coming home  
So soon, so soon to see her  
Well, I'm shooting down the turnpike  
With a driver doing ninety-five or maybe more  
Don't you think he's loaded, drunk  
Or the many things that lifes are for  
Oh, Casey, oh, Casey, don't you know  
I'll make you so damn crazy  
Living all alone by those waters  
But please say hello  
But please say hello to my little baby daughter  
Please, please, won't you just give her a great, big kiss  
And tell her daddy, stupid daddy will be coming home soon  
Oh, Casey, oh, Casey don't you know, I make me so damn crazy  
When I was living there, all alone by those still waters  
But please tell, please tell my baby baby baby daughter  
That I'm tied up now,  
But I'll be home soon, I'll be the daddy that I oughta  
Please say hello, oh Casey, please say hello  
From a stupid man  
Still my little baby daughter a big, big, big kiss  
And tell her that her daddy will be coming home soon  
But, Casey, don't you know I make me so damn crazy  
When I was living there all alone  
But won't you please give my,  
Give my baby daughter a great, big, stupid kiss  
And tell her that her stupid father will be coming home soon  
Stupid man

You've got the money, I've got the time  
You want your freedom, make your freedom mine  
'Cause I've got the style it takes  
and money is all that it takes  
You've got connections and I've got the art  
You like my attention and I like your looks  
and I have the style it take  
and you know the people it takes  
Why don't you sit right over there, we'll do a movie portrait  
I'll turn the camera on and I won't even be there  
A portrait that moves, you look great I think  
I'll put the Empire State Building on your wall  
Watch the sun rise above it in your room  
Wallpaper art, a great view  
I've got a Brillo box and I say it's art  
It's the same one you can buy at any supermarket  
'Cause I've got the style it takes  
And you've got the people it takes  
This is a rock group called The Velvet Underground  
I show movies on them  
Do you like their sound  
'Cause they have a style that grates and I have art to make  
Let's do a movie here next week  
We don't have sound but you're so great  
You don't have to speak  
You've got the style it takes (Kiss)  
You've got the style it takes (Eat)  
I've got the style it takes (Couch)  
We've got the style it takes (Kiss)  

Standing on the corner, suitcase in my hand  
Jack is in his corset, Jane is in her vest  
And me, I'm in a rock'n'roll band  
Ridin'a stutz bearcat, Jim  
You know, those were different times  
Oh, all the poets, they studied rules of verse  
And those ladies, they rolled their eyes  
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane  
  
Jack, he is a banker  
And Jane, she is a clerk  
And both of them save their monies  
When they come home from work  
Ooh, they be sittin' down by the fire  
Oh, the radio does play  
The classical music, said Jim, the 'march of the wooden soldiers'  
All you protest kids, you can hear Jack say, get ready  
Sweet Jane, come on, baby  
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane  
  
Some people, they like to go out dancing  
Other peoples, they have to work  
Just watch me now  
And there's some evil mothers  
Well they're gonna tell you that everything is just dirt  
You know, that women never really faint  
And that villains always blink their eyes  
And that, you know, children are the only ones who blush  
And that life is just to die  
But anyone who ever had a heart  
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and break it  
And anyone who's ever played a part  
Oh, they wouldn't turn around and hate it  
  
Sweet Jane, sweet Jane, sweet Jane...

I see the sword of Damocles is right above your head  
They're trying a new treatment to get you out of bed  
But radiation kills both bad and good  
It can not differentiate  
So to cure you they must kill you  
The sword of Damocles hangs above your head  
  
Now I have seen lots of peoples die  
From car crashes or drugs  
Last night on 33rd street, I saw a kid get hit by a bus  
Bus this drawn out torture over which part of you lives  
Is very hard to take  
To cure you, they must kill you  
The sword of Damocles above your head  
  
That mix of morphine and Dexedrine  
We use it on the street  
It kills the pain and keeps you up  
Your very soul to keep  
But this guessing game has its own rules  
The good don't always win  
And might makes right  
The sword of Damocles  
Is hanging above your head  
  
It seems everything's done that must be done  
From over here, though things don't seem fair  
But there are things that we can't know  
Maybe there's something over there  
Some other world that we don't know about  
I know you hate that mystic shit  
It's just another way of seeing  
The sword of Damocles above your head

I wish I had a talking book  
That told me how to act and look  
A talking book that contained keys  
To past and present memories  
A talking book that said your name  
So if you were gone, you'd still remain  
More than a picture on a shelf  
In imagination I could touch  
A talking, talking book  
  
I wish I had a talking book  
Filled with buttons you could push  
Containing looks and sights, your touch  
Your feel, your breath, your sounds, your sighs  
How much I'd bluster to ask it why  
One must live and one must die  
  
I wish I had a talking book  
By my side so I could look  
And touch and feel and dream, a look  
Much bigger than a talking book  
A taste of loving future and past  
Is that so much to really ask  
  
In this one moment's time and space  
Can our love really be replaced  
By a talking book  
Can our love really be replaced  
By a talking book  
Can our love really be replaced  
By a talking book  
Can our love ever, forever be replaced  
Can our love ever be replaced  
Can our love ever be replaced  
(Can our love really be replaced)  
By a talking book

Teach the gifted children  
Teach them to have mercy  
Teach them about sunsets  
Teach them about moonrise  
Teach them about anger  
The sin that comes with dawning  
Teach them about flowers  
And the beauty of forgetfulness  
  
Then take me to the river (take me to the river)  
And put me in the water (and put me in the water)  
Bless them and forgive them (take me to the river)  
Father cause they just don't know (take me to the river)  
  
All the gifted children  
Teach the gifted children  
The way of men and animals  
Teach them about cities  
The history of the mysteries  
Their vice and their virtues  
About branches that blow in the wind  
On the wages of their sins  
Teach them of forgiveness  
Teach them about mercy  
Teach them about music  
And the cool and cleansing waters  
  
What do they say, take me to the river (take me to the river)  
Take me to the river (take me to the river)  
Put me in the water (take me to the river)  
And teach the gifted children (take me to the river)  
All the gifted children (take me to the river)  
(Take me to the river)  
(Take me to the river)

I was staring through a telescope at night  
At a large light in the sky  
Its spinning lights reminded me of you  
A star spinning in orbit  
Lighting up the sky  
Or maybe it was not a star at all  
  
I was standing by the hudson river's edge at night  
Looking out across the Jersey shore  
At a neon light spelling out some cola's name  
And I thought your name should be dancing  
Beamed from satellites  
Larger than any billboard in Time's Square  
  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
I'm the one who loves you in each and every way  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
N.Y.C. lovers  
Tell it to your heart  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
  
I'm on the roof, it's 5 a.m.  
I guess I couldn't sleep  
And I see this spinning light that I saw last week  
Maybe I should wake you up  
But by then it might be gone  
You never know what you see when if you look up in the sky  
  
I ran outside down a darkened street  
Listening to my boot heels click  
My leather jacket squeaked I needed a cigarette  
When I turned the corner  
My spinning light was in the street  
They were filming a commercial on T.V.  
  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
We're no teenage movie that ends in tragedy  
Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
N.Y.C. lovers  
Tell it to your heart [Repeat x 3]  
  
(Tell it to your heart, please don't be afraid  
Tell it to your heart)  
[Repeat x 2]

Can't help it, now, baby  
You better make your face get out of here, quick  
Maybe your ass was getting, aah, too rich  
It ain't like we ain't never seen this thing before  
And if it turns you then around  
Then you better hit the door  
But I know, it's just a temporary thing  
Ooh, yeah, it's just a temporary thing  
  
You've read too many books  
You've seen too many plays  
And it's things like this, that turn you away  
Hey, hey, now, now, look, ha, look  
Hey look, hey look, hey look, you better think about it twice  
I know that your good breeding makes it seem not so nice  
It's just a temporary thing  
Aha, aha, aha, it's just a temporary thing  
  
Where's the number, where's the dime and where's the phone  
I feel like a stranger  
I guess you want to go back home  
Your mother, your father, your brother  
I guess you wouldn't agree with me  
But I don't give two shits, they're no better than me  
  
Aha, it's just a temporary thing, oh yeah, been there before  
Just a temporary thing, oh yeah, been there before  
Ahh, bitch, get of my... temporary thing  
Get out, it's just a temporary thing...

This is the place where she lay her head  
When she went to bed at night  
And this is the place our children were conceived  
Candles lit the room at night  
  
And this is the place where she cut her wrists  
That odd and fateful night  
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling  
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling  
  
This is the place where we used to live  
I paid for it with love and blood  
And these are the boxes that she kept on the shelf  
Filled with her poetry and stuff  
  
And this is the room where she took the razor  
And cut her wrists that strange and fateful night  
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling  
And I said, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, what a feeling  
  
I never would have started if I'd known  
That it'd end this way  
But funny thing I'm not at all sad  
That it stopped this way  
Stopped this way

And the actresses relate  
To the actor who comes home late  
After the plays have gone down  
And the crowds have scattered around  
Though the city lights and the streets  
No ticket could be beat  
For the beautiful show of shows  
Ah, broadway only knows  
The great white milky way  
It had something to say  
When he fell down on his knees  
After soaring through the air  
With nothing to hold him there  
It was really not so cute  
To play without a parachute  
As he stood upon the ledge  
Looking out, he thought he saw a brook  
And he hollered, look, there are the bells  
And he sang out, here come the bells  
Here come the bells, here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells  
Here come the bells  

[Edgar:]  
Never bet the devil your head  
When I was an infant  
My mother treated me like a tough steak  
To her well regulated mind  
Babies were the better for beatings  
But she was left handed  
And a child flogged left handed  
Is better left unflogged  
The world revolves from right to left  
It will not do to whip a baby from left to right  
If each blow in the right direction  
Drives an evil propensity out  
A blow in the opposite direction  
Knocks it's quota of wickedness in  
Hence my precocity in vice  
My sensitivity to injuries  
The thousands of injuries heaped upon me by Fortunato  
And then finally his rabid insults for which I vowed revenge  
I gave no utterance to threat  
But the knowledge of "avengemenship"  
Was so definite so precise  
That no risk could befall me  
By neither word  
Nor deed had I given cause to doubt my good will  
I would punish with impunity  
I will fuck him up the ass and piss in his face  
I will redress the wrong  
But lips and psyche  
Mind be silent  
Fortunato approaches  
  
[Fortunato:]  
Don't take me to task  
For loving a cask  
The cask of Amontillado  
Please don't make a pass  
You can go kiss my ass  
All I want is this mythical cask  
The cask of Amontillado  
I've heard so much through the grapevine  
I've heard so much on the line  
But the one thing that I lust after  
Is the one thing I've never had  
So is it too much to ask  
Too have just one taste of the cask  
Why you could go kiss my ass for the cask  
Of Amontillado  
Edgar old fellow  
Dear bosom friend  
Hail fellow well met  
Oh great elucidator  
Great epopee  
  
[Edgar:]  
Haha..  
Fortunato wh
