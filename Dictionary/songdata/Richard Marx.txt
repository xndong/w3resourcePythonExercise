I'm waiting for some kind of healing to begin  
And I wonder if you know the kind of pain I'm in  
It's hard wondering just what it is you see  
  
There hasn't been a moment you've been off my mind  
I've searched through every meditation I can find  
As if something could bring you back to me  
  
Do I go on in silence  
Or shout at the sky  
  
Give me all the earthly treasures  
That a single man can hold  
Put the magic in my fingers  
That turns everything to gold  
Hand me the sun, say that I've won  
The world on a string  
And then I will have almost everything  
  
I imagine you until I swear I feel your touch  
And I read the words you wrote me when it gets too much  
The one piece of solace I can steal  
  
I still need you in my life  
Like never before  
  
Give me all the earthly treasures  
That a single man can hold  
Put the magic in my fingers  
That turns everything to gold  
Hand me the sun, say I have won  
The world on a string  
And then I will have almost everything  
  
I still need you in my life  
More than ever before  
  
Give me all the earthly treasures  
That a single man can hold  
Put the magic in my fingers  
That turns everything to gold  
Hand me the sun, say I have won  
The world on a string  
And then I will have almost everything

Memories of you and me  
Tumble inside my head  
The way that we used to be  
Things that we said  
  
No one has ever made me believe so strong  
You left me to wonder  
How did our love go wrong  
  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around  
  
I lie awake at night  
Wait for the sun to shine  
I still feel you next to me  
Your lips on mine  
  
Without a warning  
You made our love a lie  
You said you were sorry  
But you never told me why  
  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around  
  
Maybe my love is in vain  
Maybe you're the hurting kind  
Can't take no more of this pain  
I've got to get you off my mind  
  
Tried to be what you wanted  
I gave you all I had  
You left me with nothing  
Nothing but a photograph  
  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around  
Angelia  
Where you running to now  
Angelia  
Got to make you turn around

I was never alive  
'Til the day I was blessed with you  
When I hold you late at night  
I know what I was put here to do  
I turn off the world and listen to you sigh  
And I will sing my Angel's Lullaby  
  
Know I'm forever near  
The one you can always call  
Right all you know to fear  
Are the shadows on your wall  
I'm here close enough  
To kiss the tears you cry  
And I will sing my Angel's Lullaby  
  
So tell me how to stop the years from racing  
Is there a secret someone knows?  
I'll never catch all the memories I'm chasing  
I'll never be ready to let go  
  
And when the world seems cold  
And you feel that all of your strength is gone  
There may be one tiny voice  
Your reason to carry on  
And when I'm not close enough  
To kiss the tears you cry  
You will sing your Angel's Lullaby  
Let this be our Angel's Lullaby

[Donna]  
We were strangers, starting out on a journey  
Never dreaming what we'd have to go through  
Now here we are and I'm suddenly standing  
At the beginning with you  
  
[Richard]  
No one told me I was going to find you  
Unexpected, what you did to my heart  
  
[Both]  
When I lost hope, you were there to remind me  
This is the start  
  
And life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is a river, I wanna keep flowing  
Life is a road, now and forever  
Wonderful journey  
I'll be there when the world stops turning  
I'll be there when the storm is through  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning with you  
  
[Donna]  
We were strangers on a crazy adventure  
[Richard]  
Never dreaming how our dreams would come true  
[Both]  
Now here we stand, unafraid of the future  
At the beginning with you  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
I knew there was somebody, somewhere  
Like me alone in the dark  
Now I know my dream will live on  
I've been waiting so long  
Nothing's gonna tear us apart  
  
[Repeat Chorus]  
  
[Richard]  
Yeah...  
  
[Both]  
Life is a road and I wanna keep going  
Love is a river, I wanna keep going on  
  
[Donna]  
Starting out on a journey  
  
[Both]  
Life is a road that I wanna keep going  
Love is a river, I wanna keep on flowing  
In the end I wanna be standing  
At the beginning...  
With you

Oh this must mean something  
For us to endure all the hurt  
And I've tried to analyze through  
If maybe it's more than it's worth  
  
I've already found a mountain to move  
Should that be all that it takes?  
And it isn't like there's nothing to lose  
Only me, only you  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back to me  
  
Like the shadow that follows  
I wander around in a trance  
You could wake me from this big sleep  
All that we take is a chance  
  
We could run away somewhere alone  
Make up a little lost time  
'Cause there's nothing worse than nowhere to go  
All alone, no one home  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I'll be rescued if only you come back to me  
  
More than long enough  
We've been holding all the way  
If you wait too long  
The colors start to fade  
  
'Cause it isn't like there's nothing to lose  
Only me, only you  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back to me  
  
I don't notice if it's night or day  
I stand around in the pouring rain  
I don't answer when they call my name  
I will come to if only you come back...  
I'll be rescued if only you come back...  
I'll get through if only you come back... To me  
  
Back to me, baby...  
  
Come back to me...  
  
Come back to me...

Youve got to get up every morning  
With a smile on your face  
And show the world  
All the love in your heart.  
Then people gonna treat you better.  
Youre gonna find, yes you will,  
That youre beautiful as you feel.  
  
Waiting at the station with the workday wind a blowin,  
I've got nothing to do but watch the passers by.  
Mirrored in their faces I see frustration growing,  
And they don't see it showing. Why do i?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I have often asked myself  
The reason for the sadness  
In a world where tears are just a lullaby.  
And if theres any answer,  
Maybe love can end the madness.  
Maybe not, oh, but we can only try.  
  
[chorus out]

Baby don't you look so sad  
You know we have  
Something that should only ever make you smile  
It's not like it was something we were looking for  
We were sliding doors  
It's what it is it doesn't need to be defined  
No regrets, come to bed  
I'll set all your worries free  
Come with me, It's what you need  
Shut your mouth just let it be  
Just let it go and let it be  
Oh, Everything is meant to be a memory  
Oh, So one last time do anything you want with me  
  
And I promise I will leave you  
With a beautiful goodbye  
I won't lie but I'll apologize  
Cuz I'll never make a promise you know I won't keep  
I'll make love to you, I know you want it, too  
Whisper something sweet but no more questions please  
Drops of sweat, dripping wet  
The taste of you all over me  
You will see, It's what you need  
Shut your mouth just let it be  
Just let it... Be  
  
Oh, Everything is meant to be a memory  
Oh, So one last time do anything you want with me  
And I promise I will leave you  
With a beautiful goodbye  
  
Nothing good lasts forever... Nothing  
Oh Nothing lasts forever Nothing  
Nothing can last forever... Nothing  
Nothing lasts forever... Nothing  
  
Oh, Everything is meant to be a memory  
Oh, So one last time do anything you want with me  
And I promise I will leave you  
With a beautiful goodbye  
I won't lie but I'll apologize

I've been searching  
Not the first or the last  
Trying to figure out the mystery of the half empty glass  
Time is turning for the rest of the world  
While a temporary leap of faith helps the story unfurl  
  
They say that hearts don't stay broken  
Even though the scars remain  
And eyes don't stay swollen  
Even if it feels that way  
  
[Chorus]  
But it's not that serious  
I'm a big boy now  
And I'm not that delirious  
So don't show me how  
Cause I've gotten beyond the agony  
And my perspective is saving me  
  
Never doubted what the cards would reveal  
And if the joker showed his ugly face  
Not that big of a deal  
It's just a moment in the scheme of it all  
But it's difficult to visualize when the axe starts to fall  
  
But then a heart won't stay broken  
Even on it's darkest day  
The right door could open  
Pick you up and drift away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With all the confusion  
How does anybody come through  
But life is illusion  
And no one can tell you what you've gotta do  
  
You know a heart won't stay broken  
Even on it's darkest day  
The right door could open  
Pick you up and drift away

Never knew love before  
Never dreamed there could be something more  
Felt my heart overflow  
With the danger of needing you so  
  
It's a mystery I can't explain  
But I shiver when I hear your name  
  
[Chorus]  
You are the fire  
Every desire  
Breathless we fall in love  
Love is the answer  
We are the dancers  
Breathless we fall in love  
We fall in love  
  
You've crept into my soul  
And I'm ready to lose all control  
Let our hearts fill with light  
Every moment you make is so right  
  
It's a mystery I can't explain  
But I shiver when I hear your name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No need to worry  
No need to hurry  
Breathless we fall in love  
Love is the answer  
We are the dancers  
Breathless we fall in love  
We fall in love  
  
It's a mystery to me I can't explain  
But I shiver when I hear your name  
  
[Chorus]

If you ever change your mind  
About leaving, leaving me behind  
Whoa, oh bring it to me  
Bring your sweet lovin  
Bring it on home to me  
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)  
  
Id give you jewelry and money too  
That aint all, that aint all I'd do for you  
Whoa, oh bring it to me  
Bring your sweet lovin  
Bring it on home to me  
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)  
  
You know I'll always be your slave  
Till Im buried, buried in my grave  
Whoa, oh bring it to me  
Bring your sweet lovin  
Bring it on home to me  
Yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah) yeah (yeah)  
  
If you ever change your mind  
About leaving, leaving me behind  
Whoa, oh bring it to me  
Bring your sweet lovin  
  
Bring it home to me

One after one they give into the urge  
Caught by some hand of desire.  
Held by the feelings that brings them together.  
Its all a mystery. When will they learn.  
Its just emotion on fire.  
That soul taking, primitive, passion of nature.  
  
Chorus:  
I try to run. I try to never fall apart.  
But love takes pleasure from  
The burning of the heart  
Burning of the heart.  
  
Telling myself I should run while theres time  
I see that look in her eyes  
Shes turning the heat of the moment up higher.  
And watching for questions I have in my mind.  
She knows somewhere in our lives  
Its only love that can find us an answer.  
  
Chorus  
  
Telling myself I should run while theres time  
I see that look in her eyes  
Shes turning the heat of the moment up higher  
And watching for questions I have in my mind  
She knows somewhere in our lives  
Its only love that can find us an answer.  
  
Chorus

I had a dream that you stood right in front of me  
And called to me in black and white  
Though I could see you  
I couldn't reach you  
You faded into the light  
And when the sun turns a dream to reality  
I'm left with such an empty space  
I feel your spirit  
Know that I'm near it  
I swear I can see your face  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear me calling you  
Calling you  
But you just don't seem to answer anymore  
  
Am I supposed to pretend I don't feel the pain  
Like it happened only yesterday  
No use in trying  
To stop the crying  
I can't make it go away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hear me calling you  
Calling you  
But you just don't seem to answer anymore  
I'm calling you  
Calling you  
And I'm afraid that you won't answer anymore  
  
Where is the healing you promised me  
Maybe this feeling will burn in me forever  
  
[Chorus]

(feat. Roch Voisine)  
  
[French version of "Everyday Of Your Life"]  
  
You never really thought you'd live to see the day  
When the walls around your heart were blown away.  
Just close your eyes, and you will hear me say,  
"It's alright."  
  
The key to everything I need is in your hands.  
The part of me that no one understands.  
When all my bridges burn, you tell me that,  
"It's alright."  
  
One world, one ride,  
One 'til the end of time.  
I'll be someone standing by your side,  
Every day of your life.  
  
Il ya des jours ou par amour on oublie tout,  
(There are some days where by love we forget it all,)  
Le fou, les guerres, le chaos, les remous.  
(The fire, the wars, the chaos, the currents.)  
Rien ne sera jamais plus fort que nous.  
(Nothing will ever be as strong as we.)  
It's alright.  
On a la foi qui peut deplacer les montagnes,  
(We have a faith that can move mountains,)  
Et nos pensees qui toujours se rejoignent.  
(And our thoughts which always come together.)  
Tu sait que meme au loin, je t'accompagne.  
(You know that even when I'm far away, I'm still with you.)  
It's alright.  
  
Yeah, yeah!  
  
J's'rai la pour toi.  
(I'll be there for you.)  
Tu peux compter sur moi,  
(You can count on me,)  
Comme un ami que jamais ne t'oublie,  
(Like a friend who'll never forget you,)  
Chaque jour de ta vie,  
(Every day of your life,)  
Y'aura en moi,  
(Inside of me there will always be)  
Toujours un peu de toi.  
(A part of you.)  
Fidele comme une ombre qui te suit,  
(Faithful as a shadow that follows you,)  
Chaque jour de ta vie.  
(Every day of your life.)  
  
Over and over your heart's been left bare,  
Haunted by faith that has led you nowhere.  
You don't need to call out my name,  
'Cause I am always there!  
Always there!  
Yeah!  
  
[Guitar Interlude]  
  
J's'rai la pour toi.  
(I'll be there for you.)  
Tu peux compter sur moi,  
(You can count on me,)  
Comme un ami que jamais ne t'oublie,  
(Like a friend who'll never forget you,)  
Chaque jour de ta vie.  
(Every day of your life.)  
  
Yeah, yeah.  
  
Y'aura en moi,  
(Inside of me there will always be)  
Toujours un peu de toi.  
(A part of you.)  
Fidele comme une ombre qui te suit,  
(Faithful as a shadow that follows you,)  
Chaque jour de ta vie.  
(Every day of your life.)  
  
Chaque jour de ta vie!  
One like the earth and the sky!!  
Chaque jour de ta vie!!

All that I know in my life, I have learned on the street  
No magic carpet, no genie, no shoes on my feet  
  
Will I wake up from this nightmare?  
A fear that chills me to the bone  
Though I may be one of many  
I feel so all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
We are the children of the night  
We won't go down without a fight  
Our voice is strong, our future's bright  
And thanks to what we learned from you  
We've grown into the children of the night  
  
Left by my father with only this scar on my face  
Told by my mother that, "No, you were just a mistake."  
I have tasted my own hunger  
Sold my body to survive  
Some have paid to scratch the surface  
But they can't touch what's inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How I long for something better  
Than this life I know too well  
Lord, I know I'm bound for heaven  
Cause I've done my time in hell  
  
[Chorus]

I'm nearing the end  
Or the beginning  
Whichever one finds me  
And I'm counting the tears  
And the blessings  
That I'll leave behind me  
  
I could not ask for more  
You were the one thing worth livin' for  
  
[Chorus]  
I will remember days in Avalon  
I will remember nights in your arms  
I will remember days in Avalon  
And I will recall every moment  
Of my days in the sun  
  
As I embrace the twilight  
The memories surround me  
I would have been lost  
Sure as the rain comes  
If you hadn't found me  
  
Each breath I breathe is for you  
I never knew how to live 'til you taught me to  
  
[Chorus]  
I will run through the door  
I'm not afraid anymore  
And the light that I see is your eyes  
Once again I'll be whole  
I will live in your soul  
Longer than the rest of our lives  
  
[Chorus]

What is this, all of my darkest fears?  
Why have they gathered here?  
To watch a fool go down.  
Go away. Why would you waste your time?  
Here where the sun wont shine.  
There's nothing left for you.  
  
Chorus:  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't want me.  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't need me.  
I can't go on this way  
When everything I do depends on you.  
Depends on you.  
  
I had it all. One of the sunny boys.  
Hear my pride and joy.  
You were always there by me.  
Funny how fast sunny times go by?  
And fall to a darkened sky.  
And lot of useless toys  
  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't want me.  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't need me.  
I can t go on this way  
When every step I take depends on you  
Depends on you.  
  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't want me.  
I can't go on this way  
Knowing you don't need me.  
I can't go on this way  
When everything I do depends on you.  
Depends on you

Welcome to the big time.  
You're bound to be a star  
And even if you don't go all the way,  
I know that you'll go far  
This race is for rats, it can turn you upside down  
Ain't no one you can count on in this sleazy little town, Oh no  
  
Lots of promises in the dark  
But don't you open your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause it don't mean nothin'  
The words that they say  
Don't mean nothin'  
These games that people play  
No, it don't mean nothin'  
No victim, no crime  
It don't mean nothin'  
Till you sign it on the dotted line  
  
The director smiles as you walk in the door  
He says, "I love your work, babe" but  
You're just not what we're looking for  
It's never what but who it is you know  
So easy to get stuck in all that California snow  
  
Take a good look around and you'll find  
People tryin' to mess with your mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hollywood can be so lonely  
Make you the winner of a losing fight  
But the party is never over  
Cause stars are always shining  
Doesn't matter if it's day or night  
  
The producer says, "let me change a line or two"  
And a little bit of something can look awfully good to you  
And you want to scream, but you gotta keep it all inside  
When you're trying to make a living,  
There ain't no such thing as pride, no  
  
Lots of promises in the dark  
But don't you open your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It don't mean nothing at all

I can't believe I couldve been so blind,  
But love is strange.  
I thought about it for a long, long time,  
But the truth remains.  
I don't need another lonely night to dry my tears.  
The answers plain as black and white,  
And I can see the picture very clear.  
  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl.  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye?  
  
It isn't like you never had the chance  
To change your tune.  
Did you think that I'm a dime a dance?  
Well the dance is through.  
I've been doin things your way too long,  
But baby that's over.  
It wont be easy, but I've gotta be strong,  
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder.  
  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
I don't wanna fall, I don't wanna crawl.  
I've been livin on the edge of a broken heart.  
Don't you wonder why I gotta say goodbye?  
  
Ill find someone else whos nothing like you.  
Two can play the game as well,  
And you're gonna be sorry, baby,  
When it's over!  
  
[guitar interlude]  
  
I've been doin things your way too long,  
But baby that's over.  
It wont be easy but I've gotta be strong,  
And if I wanna cry I don't need your shoulder.  
  
[chorus out]

I was born on the banks of eternity  
A page of the history it teaches  
Not a care, lived my life like a hurricane  
Leaving everything along the way in pieces  
  
Some may have cheered, some may have wondered  
If I am flesh, if I am stone  
Thoughts of you tear through me like thunder  
You are the light that has led me back home  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
I've got no reputation living in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
Let me bury this disguise  
  
A southern boy has it harder sometimes  
It's like you were climbing a razor  
You were there when my dreams had all turned to dust  
And the man in the mirror was a stranger  
  
Look at me now, a soulless survivor  
No mask can hide the man that I've made  
You ease my pain  
Your make it silent  
Slowly I feel it beginning to fade  
  
I want to feel it  
Rushing over me into the tide  
I want to taste it  
Every moment 'til the end of my life  
  
I have laid still, adrift in you memory  
Hoping your faith would erase all the years  
Maybe some time, maybe some magic  
Maybe your love will make everything clear  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
I've got no reputation living in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
Let me bury this disguise  
  
Take me to the river, baby  
Wash away the lies  
There are no expectations hiding in your eyes  
Take me to eternity  
And let me bury this disguise

Onward I always say  
These things happen everyday  
I should be able to smile by now  
But I don't remember how  
  
[Chorus]  
With you went warmth in summer  
All of the stars in the sky  
With you went perfect sunsets  
Sleeping my way through the night  
Yeah with you went  
Everything good in this world  
  
Desperate for your touch  
I haven't been needing much  
Why let the music play?  
I can't hear it anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause with you went  
The scent of flowers  
Don't they just die anyway?  
And with you went  
  
All the rainbows  
Now when it rains it's just gray  
Yeah, with you went  
Everything good in this world  
  
And I thought of doing something rash  
In the hopes of making you feel bad  
But it seems that it's always me that ends up cryin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With you went  
All the rainbows  
Now when it rains it's just gray  
Ah, with you went  
  
Everything good  
Everything good  
In my world

I would die or kill  
Battle, beg and steal  
Baby, just to feel your eyes on me  
  
Give my secrets up  
Be slave to just your love  
One more moment of your eyes on me  
  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
But you're burning me from the inside out  
And now I live  
Oh I live to hear you say  
It's you who lives to take my breath away  
  
The thing I wouldn't do for one more taste of you  
I'm addicted to your eyes on me  
  
I don't know why, I don't know how  
But you're burning me from the inside out  
And I only live  
Oh I live to hear you say  
It's you who lives to take my breath away  
  
The thing I wouldn't do for one more taste of you  
I'm addicted to your eyes on me

Fool's game to risk perfection  
Out here alone on a wire  
Unsuspecting victim of desire  
You wear a thousand faces  
A master of disguise  
And I'm addicted to the madness in your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
You will always be the one I dream about  
And I know my heart won't beat the same again  
You will always be the shadow of a doubt  
Now I go crazy wondering what we might have been  
  
Your charms have made me suffer  
Why do I care where you are  
I'm afraid my dignity has strayed too far  
Can't read what you're writing  
Unable to make the call  
Do you want me desperately  
Or not at all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't read what you're writing  
Unable to make the call  
Do you want me desperately  
Or not at all

Swimming on a skin as she moves to my direction  
Stop, begin, I was way beyond protection  
Go in a glance I was frozen when she found me  
Lost in a trance, as she wrapped her silk around me  
  
And as her body melted on mine  
She burned the memory of it on my mind  
  
Shame on me, I forgot to remember to forget  
Should have left her in my history  
And I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember  
  
Ice in the sky, on a... She whispered to me  
Rose colored lights hit me right where she knew me  
She took me half the way to paradise  
Then left me stranded as she waved goodbye  
  
Shame on me, I forgot to remember to forget  
Should have left her in my history  
And I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember  
  
Oh, didn't know until the moment's gone and the sentence fading  
Where she knows I'll always be  
Oh shame on me, I forgot to remember  
Left her in my history  
I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember  
I forgot to remember to forget  
I should have left her in my history  
I feel like I'd be better off dead  
I forgot to remember

Born and raised in the windy city  
I moved west to kick start a dream  
What I found was a town without pity  
That'll chew you up and swallow you clean  
  
I'm amazed at the life I'm livin'  
Don't want to seem like I'm rockin' the boat  
But it ain't all about taking but giving  
I feel something tugging at my coat  
No one ever told me it would be like this  
That there'd be something called home that's too hard to miss  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm saying goodbye to the glamor  
Back to the old neighborhood  
All that I need is a place that I can breathe  
I'm saying goodbye to Hollywood  
  
Done my time in the Hoodoo Jungle  
Tired of waking up in another man's dream  
I've got the ball and I ain't gonna fumble  
Gonna make a winner of this team  
All that ever mattered were the goals I chased  
Now, I'm ready to run in the human race  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me and the Mrs. done made up our minds  
We're gonna give our boys a little less sunshine  
Call it runnin' say what you like  
I've got my own definition of paradise  
I'd rather be knee deep in snow than knee deep in jive  
I may be cold but my soul is alive  
  
[Chorus]

You were just an innocent soul  
When the darkness came and stole your light away  
How can you be anything but still.  
When the warmths of tomorrow's  
Buried in the chills of yesterday  
Dive into the deep, find it in you to believe  
In a place your wounded heart has never known  
If you dare reach for me I wont let you fall alone  
  
Have a little faith  
Have a little hope  
Have a little trust  
In the great unknown  
  
Love's been a razor deep in your chest  
Made you feel like your runnin'  
Out of breathe in slow quicksand  
It's no kind of life being locked down tight  
A heart like a flower needs a little light and a gentle hand  
Let suspicion come to rest, cast away the loneliness  
That you have carried to long  
Wrap yours arms around this moment  
Now, before it's gone  
  
Have a little faith  
Have a little hope  
Have a little trust  
In the great unknown  
  
Let the memories go blind and release your mind  
From the ghost that rage inside of you  
How can I get you to see baby, you could never be  
To lost for me to find you  
  
Just have a little faith  
Just a little, faith  
  
You and I can be ones who believe  
In a love that lingers eternally  
You and I could stay ever this way  
In a love that lingers eternally  
In a love that lingers eternally

I can't go near the scent of flowers.  
I can't look at the sky.  
I can't turn on the radio  
And not cry.  
  
I wont watch lovers holding hands  
Or the sun sinking down.  
I can't look at a single thing in this town.  
  
You were playing a game and I,  
I lost count of the days and the nights.  
Do you know that you were my life?  
  
I'm tryin hard to find all that's left of me,  
Now that you left me alone.  
Tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
I have looked through every single book,  
Torn through every poem,  
Heard the words of every voice  
That I've known.  
  
How can you have such a hold on me,  
When youve already let go?  
You must have more power than I know.  
  
Woah.  
You were playing a game and I,  
I lost count of the days and the nights.  
Oh, did you know that you were my life? !  
  
I'm tryin hard to find all that's left of me,  
Now that you left me alone,  
I'm tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
You gave me heaven and showed me how to fly,  
Then laughed when I fell from the sky, yeah!  
  
[guitar interlude]  
  
Tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
I'm tryin hard to find all that's left of me,  
Now that you left me alone,  
I'm tired of runnin away from your memory.  
I need a heart of my own.  
  
[repeat chorus]

Just when I believed I couldn't ever want for more  
This ever changing world pushes me through another door  
I saw you smile  
And my mind could not erase the beauty of your face  
Just for awhile  
Won't you let me shelter you  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold on to the nights  
Hold on to the memories  
I wish that I could give you something more  
That I could be yours  
  
How do we explain something that took us by surprise  
Promises in vain, love that is real but in disguise  
What happens now  
Do we break another rule  
Let our lovers play the fool  
I don't know how  
To stop feeling this way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I think that I've been true to everybody else but me  
And the way I feel about you makes my heart long to be free  
Every time I look into your eyes, I'm helplessly aware  
That the someone I've been searching for is right there  
  
[Chorus]

Hungry Eyes  
  
  
I've been meaning to tell you  
I've got this feelin' that won't subside  
I look at you and I fantasize  
You are mine tonight  
Now I've got you in my sights  
  
With these hungry eyes  
One look at you and I can't disguise  
I've got hungry eyes  
I feel the magic between you and I  
  
I want to hold you so hear me out  
I want to show you what love's all about  
Darlin' tonight  
Now I've got you in my sights  
  
With these hungry eyes  
One look at you and I can't disguise  
I've got hungry eyes  
I feel the magic between you  
And I've got hungry eyes  
Now I've got you in my sights  
With these hungry eyes  
Now did I take you by surprise  
  
I need you to see  
This love was meant to be  
  
I've got hungry eyes  
One look at you and I can't disguise  
I've got hungry eyes  
I feel the magic between you  
And I've got hungry eyes  
Now I've got you in my sights  
With those hungry eyes  
Did I take you by surprise  
  
With my hungry eyes

Got a house full of fortune and they pay me in gold  
For something I'd do for free  
But there's still something missing that a  
man can't hold  
It's like a weight over me  
  
So scared the thrill will be gone  
But I'm the one who keeps the pressure on  
  
[Chorus]  
All I've got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and I'm tired to the bone  
All I've got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and I know I'm not alone  
  
Well, I'm sick of walking 'round with blood in my eyes  
Just keeping up with this town  
I' m a roadrunner racing, but I don't see the signs  
I've got to learn to slow down  
  
My life makes it hard to complain  
But there's times I'd take my school days back again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Four o'clock and I'm still counting sheep  
Love to change the system, but I'm in too deep  
I keep the pressure far away as I can  
But it still comes back again, back again, yeah, yeah  
  
My life makes it hard to complain  
But there's times I'd take my school days back again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All I've got is all I need  
But I get no sleep and I'm sure I'm not alone  
I'm not alone, yeah

Heart beat pounding so hard it keeps me wide awake at night  
I wait alone in the dark for you to make the moment right  
If I could only show you all that might be lost  
Then you would never wonder what the secret was  
And this is what I'd tell you  
  
The lonely heart you see tonight  
Will not give up without a fight  
And I'm never gonna let it fade away  
  
Oh, you can look in my eyes and see that you're the only one  
I would break down and cry if you became the lonely one  
I'd rather play the fool and try to hold a star  
Than never know if you were going to break my heart  
And I can see it shining  
  
No matter what I say to make you understand  
It's all up to you to take the future in your hands  
So please don't keep me waiting

Elusive happiness  
Can be like promises  
That rest so gently on our pillow  
We stood out on the ledge  
And leaned over the edge  
And nearly fell right through that window  
There were those who had us done by now  
Baby, we've only just begun  
  
The world may crash and burn  
Or suddenly just cease to turn  
But love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on  
Our love goes on  
  
No one may recognize  
What lives behind our eyes  
Sometimes the good times are the hardest  
And when my strength is gone  
  
It's you that I lean on  
A light at the end of all my darkness  
And in the end if I know nothing else  
The answer is only in your arms  
  
The world may crash and burn  
Or suddenly just cease to turn  
But love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on  
And in the end if I know nothing else  
The answer is right here in your arms  
It's always in your arms  
  
The world may crash and burn  
Or suddenly just cease to turn  
But love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on  
Oh love goes on  
It may look out of reach  
  
And time may rob us like a thief  
But love goes on

Victim of temptation  
Can't make it go away  
You see it and you want it baby  
Never hear a word I say  
You know I don't want nothing I don't deserve  
Oh, no I won't take less than I know I'm worth  
  
All this talking makes me feel like a monkey in a cage  
Ain't no point in trying to change a man of my age  
  
Love unemotional, purely physical  
What I'm staying for's a mystery to me  
Love unemotional, the heart's invisible  
Love unemotional is what you want from me  
  
People say I'm crazy  
Wonder why I play your game  
Sure beats feeling lonely, baby  
But the story ends the same  
I want to feel like I'm living in a fairy tale  
Don't want to be just another broken heart for sale  
  
Do I have to hit my knees and beg for something more  
Maybe this is not the love I've waited for  
  
Love unemotional, simply physical  
What I'm staying for is a mystery to me  
Love unemotional, the girl's insatiable  
Love unemotional is what you want from me  
  
You feel no shame in being so unkind  
All touch and zero feeling  
I don't see a way of changing your mind  
  
Girl this kind of life is bound to leave you all alone  
The light inside your heart is on, but no one's home  
  
Love unemotional, purely physical  
What I'm staying for's a mystery to me  
Love unemotional, the heart's invisible  
Love unemotional is what you want from me  
  
Love unemotional, simply physical  
What I'm staying for is a mystery to me  
Love unemotional, the girl's insatiable  
Love unemotional is what you want from me

I've seen the lights go out on broadway,  
I saw the empire state laid low.  
And life went on beyond the palaces.  
They all bought cadillacs,  
Left there long ago  
  
We held a concert out in brooklyn.  
To watch the island bridges blow.  
It turned our power down,  
And drove us underground,  
But we went right on with the show.  
  
I've seen the lights go out on broadway,  
I saw the ruins at life end.  
You know we almost didn't notice it,  
We see it all the time  
On 42nd street  
  
It burned the churches up in harlem  
Like in that spanish civil war.  
The flames were everywhere,  
And no one really cared,  
It always burned up there before  
  
I've seen the rats lie down on broadway,  
And I watched the miami skyline fall.  
The folks were waving at the battery  
The union went on strike  
They never settled it out.  
  
They sent a carrier out from norfolk,  
And picked the yankees up for free.  
They said the queens could stay  
And threw the crowns away,  
And sent manhattan out to sea.  
  
She knows those lights right on broadway  
That was so many years ago.  
Before we all lived in florida.  
Before the mafia,  
Took over mexico.  
  
There are too many who remember.  
They say a handful still survive.  
To tell the world about,  
The way the lights went out,  
To keep the memory alive.

It's hard to see reason when there's so little hope alive  
But this is the season to put faith in innocent eyes  
We're all thinking too much, we're so out of touch  
We need to start over again  
So just let it wander, 'cause you're never to old to pretend  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell you, just a little miracle is all you need to believe  
Just a little miracle is all you need to believe  
  
It's not too late to wake up  
Don't make no difference who you are  
Just take off your make-up  
And discover the child in your heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're all thinking too much, we're so out of touch  
We need to start over again  
So just let it wander  
'Cause you're never too old to pretend  
  
[Chorus]

It's a peaceful thing to know that freedom as a rule belongs to me  
There's something very wrong when the color of a man is all you see  
After all this time how can a single voice explain  
Any reason for the pain we all have seen  
It's not a dream  
  
[Chorus]  
One man stood tall  
And faced the devil with his back to the wall  
And took one step closer to heaven above  
  
So he took a stand and walked where no one else would dare to even try  
It was the only way  
If not for bravery, the soul would surely die  
And right before my eyes he gave his life unselfishly  
So that all the father's children could be free  
Like you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before his work is done  
We've got to put an end to this game of choosing sides  
I want us to be one  
And I won't let it go 'till it's over  
I'm here waiting  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm waiting, waiting

Nothing I must do  
Nowhere I should be  
No one in my life  
To answer to, but me  
No more candlelights  
No more purple skies  
No one to be near  
As my heart slowly dies  
  
Chorus:  
If I could hold you one more time  
Like in the days when you were mine  
I'd look at you  
Till I was blind  
So you would stay  
I'd say a prayer each time you sign  
Cradle the moments like a child  
I'd stop the world if only i  
Could hold you one more time  
Mmmmmm. . .  
  
I've memorized your face  
I know your touch by heart  
Still lost in your embrace  
I dream of where you are  
  
Chorus

There was nothing missing, it was just a case of foolishness  
Girl, I must've been crazy  
Something I would just as soon forget  
I can only say I'm sorry and leave it up to you to say the rest  
  
[Chorus]  
If you want to go, girl, I won't stand in your way  
But I'll stand by you if you decide you want to stay  
Baby, don't you see  
Doesn't have to be forever or goodbye  
All I'm asking for is one more try  
  
I'm the one who hurt you, still I know the pain you're going through  
And even if you show forgiveness, there may be too much damage to undo  
I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My heart and soul are searching  
Trying to find a way  
To bring your love back to me  
  
Still I hear these voices telling me not to give up on you  
  
[Chorus]

Only reminds me of you  
  
I see you, beside me  
It's only a dream  
A vision of what used to be  
The laughter, the sorrow  
Pictures in time  
Fading to memory  
How could I ever let you go  
Isn't too late to let it show  
  
That I come to run from your side  
But this place I hide  
It only reminds me of you  
When I turn out of the light  
Even the night  
It only reminds me of you  
  
I needed my freedom  
This what I've thought  
But I was a fool to believe  
My heart breaks while you cry  
Rivers of tears  
But I was too blind to see  
How could I ever let you go  
Isn't too late to let you show  
  
That I come to run from your side  
But this place I hide  
It only reminds me of you  
When I turn out of the light  
Even the night  
It only reminds me of you  
  
Only you...  
  
Please come back to me  
I'm down on my knees  
God give me strength...  
  
That I come to run from your side  
But this place I hide  
It only reminds me of you  
When I turn out of the light  
Even the night  
It only reminds me of you

Baby, I'm tryin' to make some sense  
Of all we should've learned from experience  
We win, we lose, we conquer and we fail  
One part serious, do or die  
Another part crush in junior high  
I'm chasing my emotions like a tail  
I can still move my fingers  
But I can't seem to let go  
  
The cold winds are blowing, I should be goin'  
I'm in over my head  
Without even blinkin', you've got me thinkin'  
I would be better off dead  
Yeah' I'm in over my head  
  
You made me weak, I made you laugh  
Driving through the rain in a yellow cab  
The taste of your kiss is with me even now  
But this thing we've got goes by different names  
Never two days in a row the same  
I wanna stop feelin' this, but don't know how  
  
I see my legs and they're moving  
But I just can't walk away  
  
Chorus  
  
I'll say goodbye, but talk is cheap  
I count the memories in my sleep  
I've had enough, but I want more  
  
Makin' me weak, makin' you laugh  
Driving through the rain in that yellow cab  
Baby, your kiss is with me even now  
  
Chorus

Everybody's talking, the world is goin' round  
Rumors are flying all over the town  
How could a stranger know what's still a  
mystery to me  
  
I don't know what to call it  
I don't know what it is  
I only know for certain I've never felt like this  
And, baby, it's the one thing I can believe  
  
There's nothing I fear in this life  
Long as I've got you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
We're mighty as a hurricane, tougher than stone  
Stronger than anything I've ever known  
One look at us together anybody could see  
There ain't nothin' that can stand up to  
The power of you and me  
  
We're only good together, no good on our own  
Everything about you feels just like home  
Before you I don't remember how I got along  
  
You are the spark to my flame  
The only one that burns in your name  
  
[Chorus]  
So many souls searching for  
What we're holding right in our hands  
You're the woman that makes me a better man  
  
[Chorus]

You say you'll get over it  
But I know you better  
Your feelings have been hurt a bit  
And you just can't forget her  
You'll want her back by tomorrow  
But she won't remember your name  
You better  
  
Get lost in the rhythm  
Get lost in the rhythm of life  
Get lost in the rhythm  
Get lost in the rhythm of life  
  
You say that my soul is lost  
And that you're my savior  
You'll do anything at any cost  
To reform my behavior  
Didn't I make it this far  
By making up my own mind  
You gotta  
  
Get lost in the rhythm  
Get lost in the rhythm of life

Try to remember those ancient evenings  
When all we had was just enough.  
Now the pretender knows why the king is screaming.  
The grief was finally just too much.  
  
I'm going to ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame.  
  
Over my shoulder, I know they're waiting.  
Their dirty hands are everywhere.  
And as they get closer all the pretense is fading.  
The face beneath the skin is bare.  
  
So now I ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage, oh yeah.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame.  
  
I can never learn to say no.  
Wont they ever let me go?  
  
[guitar interlude]  
  
I'm going to ride with the idol  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage. Oh yeah, yeah.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame.  
Ride with the idol,  
Like a creature on display,  
Tied to the bottom of a cage. Oh yeah, yeah.  
Ride with the idol,  
But it wont turn out the same.  
I know they wont blow out the flame (fade)

Oceans apart day after day  
And I slowly go insane  
I hear your voice on the line  
But it doesn't stop the pain  
  
If I see you next to never  
How can we say forever  
  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Whatever it takes  
Or how my heart breaks  
I will be right here waiting for you  
  
I took for granted, all the times  
That I thought would last somehow  
I hear the laughter, I taste the tears  
But I can't get near you now  
  
Oh, can't you see it baby  
You've got me going crazy  
  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Whatever it takes  
Or how my heart breaks  
I will be right here waiting for you  
  
I wonder how we can survive  
This romance  
But in the end if I'm with you  
I'll take the chance  
  
Oh, can't you see it baby  
You've got me going crazy  
  
Wherever you go  
Whatever you do  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Whatever it takes  
Or how my heart breaks  
I will be right here waiting for you  
Waiting for you

We work our bodies weary to stay alive  
There must be more to living than nine to five  
  
Why should we wait for some better time  
There may not even be a tomorrow  
Ain't no sense in losing your mind  
I'm gonna make it worth the ride  
  
Don't you know, I won't give up until I'm satisfied  
Don't you know, why should I stop until I'm satisfied  
  
Ignore the hesitation, that ties your hands  
Use your imagination, and take a chance  
  
I won't let my moment of truth pass me by  
I've gotta make my move now or never  
And if they turn me loose on this town  
They're gonna have to hold me down  
  
Don't you know, I won't give up until I'm satisfied  
Don't you know, why should I stop until I'm satisfied Yeah  
  
Oh, don't you know, ain't gonna stop until we're satisfied  
Don't you know, we shouldn't stop until we're satisfied  
  
Don't you know, ain't gonna stop until I'm satisfied  
Don't you know, we won't give up until we're satisfied

I said I wouldn't cry  
The day you say goodbye  
It's not like I'll never see you again  
I guess the things you need  
You just can't get from me  
But you still can reach out to me now and then  
  
My head is spinning round  
All my defenses down  
I have held the world in my hands  
But I can't keep you from slipping away,  
  
If time will show me grace  
And you to a better place  
Then I can live knowing it wasn't in vain  
It hurts so much to know when love means letting go  
And no one can tell me that they've felt my pain  
  
No strength can stop you now  
Will someone show me how  
How to live it over again  
'cause I can't keep you from slipping away  
  
I will never break your power over me  
I could never shake the thought of you burning in my mind  
You're all I see  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Oh, I can't keep you from slipping away  
Oh, Slipping away,

I've lived life in a single room  
Hiding my scars from the moon  
I dream my dreams in the light  
  
Rehearse the lines I already know  
Basking in the tv's glow  
And pray that tonight is the night  
  
Oh, there's gotta be more than this  
A future hanging on a stranger's kiss  
Could it be I'm not so alone  
  
I'm someone special  
I'm just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyone's eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
There's someone special  
Waiting out there for me  
  
I guess the joke hasn't hit me yet  
Cause I'm still waiting on my juliet  
She must be held up somewhere  
  
Ooh, she will be the air I breathe  
She'll come for good and never want to leave  
And I'll love her only, I swear  
  
People say there must be something wrong  
For me to be all alone so long  
And their words hit me like a stone  
  
I'm someone special  
I'm just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyone's eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
There's someone special  
Waiting out there for me  
  
Lying in bed in a cold, cold sweat  
Dreaming 'bout women I'll never get  
I won't always be sleeping alone  
  
I'm someone special  
I'm just in disguise  
I may not be perfect  
In everyone's eyes  
It may not be tomorrow  
But I still believe  
There's someone special  
Waiting out there for me

So many times  
I've asked myself the question  
Hiding in plain sight  
Is your love another self-propeller perception  
  
Burning in my mind  
You don't know where I've been  
I count too many sins  
To play de sad charade  
  
Suspicion kisses you when I do  
Though I've never let you know  
I only wish you knew what I knew  
So we could both enjoy the show  
  
Here in the crucible  
Or could there be another explanation  
I'm not aware of  
Or should I just ignore the situation  
  
Call me in care of  
I don't know where you've been  
Your lie's is paper thin  
I see the truth erased  
  
Suspicion kisses you when I do  
Though I've never let you know  
I only wish you knew what I knew  
So we could both enjoy the show  
  
Here in the crucible  
You don't know where I've been  
I count too many sins  
To play de sad charade  
  
Suspicion kisses you when I do  
Though I've never let you know  
I only wish you knew what I knew  
So we could both enjoy the show  
Here in the crucible

All alone at the end of the evening  
And the bright lights have faded to blue  
I was thinking bout a woman who might have  
Loved me and I never knew  
You know I've always been a dreamer  
(spent my life running round)  
And it's so hard to change  
(can't seem to settle down)  
But the dreams I've seen lately  
Keep on turning out and burning out  
And turning out the same  
  
So put me on a highway  
And show me a sign  
And take it to the limit one more time  
  
You can spend all your time making money  
You can spend all your love making time  
If it all fell to pieces tomorrow  
Would you still be mine?  
  
And when you're looking for freedom  
(nobody seems to care)  
And you can find the door  
(can't find it anywhere)  
When there's nothing to believe in  
Still you're coming back, you're running back for more  
  
So put me on a highway  
And show me a sign  
And take it to the limit one more time  
  
Take it to the limit  
Take it to the limit  
Take it to the limit one more time

I met her on a strip  
It was another lost weekend  
But the band was too slick  
And the people were twisted  
  
So I asked her for a date  
She reluctantly agreed  
Then we went to my place  
And she never did leave  
  
She won't even miss me when she's gone  
And that's okay with me, I'll cry later on  
  
It's been six months  
She hasn't shut up once  
I've tried to explain  
She's driving me insane  
  
She won't even miss me when she's gone  
That's okay with me, I'll cry later on  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll just see you around  
  
Get out, I'm telling you now  
Do you catch my drift  
What could be plainer than this  
  
Nothin' more to be said  
Write me a letter instead  
I don't mean to be cruel  
But I'm finished with you  
  
She won't even miss me when she's gone  
That's okay with me I'll cry later on  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll just see you around  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll just see you around  
  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight  
I'll talk to ya later  
Just save it for another guy  
I'll talk to ya later  
Don't want to hear it again tonight

I was sitting in the classroom,  
Trying to look intelligent  
In case the teacher looked at me.  
She was long and she was lean.  
She's a middle-aged dream,  
And that lady means the whole world to me.  
  
It's a natural achievement,  
Conquering my homework  
With her image pounding in my brain.  
She's an inspiration  
For my graduation,  
And she helps to keep the classroom sane.  
  
Oh teacher I need you,  
Like a little child.  
You got something in you  
To drive a schoolboy wild.  
  
You give me education  
In the lovesick blues.  
Help me get straight come out and say,  
Teacher I, teacher I, teacher I,  
Teacher I need you.  
  
I have to write a letter,  
Tell about my feelings,  
Just to let her know the scene.  
Focus my attention  
On some further education  
In connection with the birds and the bees.  
  
So I'm sitting in the classroom.  
I'm looking like a zombie.  
I'm waiting for the bell to ring.  
I've got John Wayne stances.  
I've got Erroll Flynn advances,  
And it doesn't mean a doggone thing.

You gave me life,  
Gave me your heart  
Your shoulder when I needed to cry  
You gave me hope when all my hope is gone  
Wings so my dreams can fly  
And I haven't told you enough  
Haven't been good enough, making you see  
  
Chorus:  
  
My love for you will live in my heart  
Until eternity's through....  
I see your smile in the eyes of my child  
I am who I am, Mama, Thanks to you  
  
You gave me your word,  
Gave me your voice  
Gave me your everything,  
Each breath of your life  
You believe when I can never have  
You teach my faith to survive  
And I never can do enough  
Never thank you enough, for all that you are  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
I know the treasure, I'm filled with grace  
Whenever I see your face  
  
(... Music....).  
  
And I see your smile in the eyes of my child  
I am who I am, Mama, Thanks to You  
To you.....

No one can decide  
When lightning will strike  
And everything falls into place  
But lately it seems  
When you're in my dreams  
I find that I don't want to wake  
  
I want to slowly  
Unlock the mystery  
I want to make love  
I want to make history  
  
[Chorus:]  
With you  
I see a lifetime with you  
And if one thing is true  
It's that God knew someday I'd be standing  
On the edge of forever with you  
  
I'm ready to fall  
To give you my all  
Cause you're everything I'll ever want  
It's amazing to me  
How far we can see  
Our horizon goes on and on  
  
I want to slowly  
Unlock the mystery  
I want to make love  
I want to make history  
  
[Chorus:]  
And when I'm shivering  
Your body will be my blanket  
And then I'm drifting, baby  
You'll be my anchor  
  
[Chorus:]

Who can say for certain  
Maybe you're still here  
I feel you all around me  
Your memory's so clear  
Deep in the stillness  
I can hear you speak  
You're still an inspiration  
Can it be  
That you are mine  
Forever love  
And you are watching over me from up above  
Fly me up to where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for awhile to know you're there  
A breath away's not far  
To where you are  
Are you gently sleeping  
Here inside my dream  
And isn't faith believing  
All power can't be seen  
As my heart holds you  
Just one beat away  
I cherish all you gave me everyday  
'Cause you are mine  
Forever love  
Watching me from up above  
And I believe  
That angels breathe  
And that love will live on and never leave  
Fly me up  
To where you are  
Beyond the distant star  
I wish upon tonight  
To see you smile  
If only for awhile  
To know you're there  
A breath away's not far  
To where you are  
I know you're there  
A breath away's not far  
To where you are

With another day another life slips away  
And floats above the crowd  
You can only stay ahead of time when time co-operates  
Instead of heading south  
Cards are dealt  
You play what you hold  
You can't tell me the story's been told  
  
[Chorus: ]  
It's too early to be over  
And it's way past when  
It could be starting again  
It's too early to be over  
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know  
  
Run down run around biting my tongue  
Hardly my sad tale  
But the rolling in and steppin' out  
Nothing but fun  
I finally had to bail  
Nothing worse than trying too hard  
This ain't this fool's first walk in the park  
  
It's too early to be over  
I don't feel a thing from the bone to the skin  
It's too early to be over  
Good hearted Joe is the last one to know  
  
Somewhere out there it all evens out  
So they would have you believe  
But that don't get me  
That won't set me free  
  
It's too early to be over  
And it's way past when it could be starting over  
It's too early to be over  
Always the fave but I already gave  
  
[Chorus: ]

I was born an only son  
Didn't take to the rules, like a normal child  
Prisoner of the things I've done  
It's the price you pay livin' fast and wild  
  
[Chorus]  
I've spent too many nights lookin' over my shoulder  
And the ways of the world make a heart grow colder  
Got nowhere left to hide  
The fight in me has died  
So I must wait for the sunrise  
  
Friend to fear and loaded gun  
Live life like the owner of a heart of stone  
No one touches, touch no one  
But the road gets wary when you're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Too much done to undo  
No one I can run to  
I need one more chance to live my life again  
  
[Chorus]

How long is it s'posed to take  
Which song got the answer straight  
I thought I sang 'em all  
What face am I gonna make  
Which leg to I have to break  
To know I took the fall  
  
It's like I'm standing on the edge of madness  
Save me from crossing that line  
Sure that I'll never come back  
  
[Chorus: ]  
With the dawn, life goes on  
How long can I keep waiting on your love  
Hold my breath, give me strength  
How long can I keep holding on  
How long can I keep waiting on your love  
  
True love is a funny thing  
Too much for a diamond ring  
To guarantee applause  
Too late when you have to guess  
Which joke's taken as tenderness  
Penny for your thoughts  
  
Just like I'm hanging off the edge of madness  
Stop me from falling so far  
How can you let me let go  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
I keep every moment frozen in time  
And if they're all I get, I'll be cold the rest of my life  
  
[Chorus: ]

Well look at me, the guy who's got it all  
Tryin' to read my own writing on the wall  
Not happy 'til the sadness comes  
To keep me company  
Oh, but what becomes of fools who love like me  
  
Who's gonna dry my tears  
When I'm crying?  
Who's gonna hold my hand  
When I'm dying?  
Who's gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
  
Sure as winter goes and comes around again  
I will be my own undoing in the end  
I'll find the answers I've been searching for  
In your goodbye kiss  
Cause I don't deserve you and you don't deserve this  
  
Who's gonna dry my tears  
When I'm crying?  
And who's gonna hold my hand  
When I'm dying?  
Who's gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Yeah, who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
  
Never happy 'til the darkness comes  
And rains down on me  
Down on me  
  
And who's gonna dry my tears  
When I'm crying?  
And who's gonna hold my hand  
When I'm dying?  
Who's gonna set me right when  
Everything is wrong  
Who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
  
Who's gonna love me when you're gone?  
Baby when you're gone  
Yeah, who's gonna love me  
When you're gone?  
Who's gonna love me when you're gone?  
Who's gonna love me?

Nowhere to hide, you can't escape the fun  
No matter where you run  
All that is gone with the times  
And time will tell on you if you don't carry through  
You've got your soul on the line  
  
Long as you know which side the sun rises on everyone  
Wherever you go you'll understand  
Holding the light in the center of your hand, There's a  
  
[Chorus]  
Whole world to save  
There's a whole world to save  
You can start any place, there's a  
Whole world to save, Whole world  
Not any reason to wait  
  
You're alone, you and everything with a face  
Why'd they call it human race?  
All in a world of our own  
I think it's gone far enough, I say we call their bluff  
Somebody's got to be strong  
If you get one wild night in life, oh, you'd better get it right  
If it's the only life you get  
What is it worth if it's you and nothing left, there's a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Making a difference, seeing what nobody sees  
I won't wait for a deliverance 'cause I know it's waiting for me  
  
Long as you know which side the sun rises on everyone  
Wherever you go, you'll understand  
Holding the light in the center of your hand, there's a  
  
[Chorus]

The world's greatest mystery  
Is love between the woman and the man  
Some guys are Romeos  
Others simply do the best they can  
I'm just your average, ordinary Joe  
Tryin' to learn things I never knew I had to know  
What's a man supposed to do  
  
I don't get no kick from nine to five  
And I'm not a man who thinks it's true  
It's a woman's place to keep a love alive  
I've watched enough daytime TV  
To know my baby's needs  
But sometimes I swear that she's impossible to please  
She says  
  
[Chorus]  
You give me all that I want of your money, baby  
But you never take me dancing  
  
I really think I do a lot to show  
How I feel about her in my way  
Roses on our anniversary  
Candlelight and me on her birthday  
Just when I thought that I had it all worked out  
Now she says I still don't know what it's all about  
She says  
  
[Chorus]  
You give me all that I want of your money, baby  
But you never take me dancing  
You give me sweet little talk, call me honey, baby  
But you never take me dancing  
  
I'm just your average, ordinary Joe  
Tryin' to learn things I never knew I had to know  
  
[Chorus]

Though you're far away from home,  
Where the cold and lonely roam,  
Don't forget the setting sun  
Shines on everyone,  
And you'll never be alone.  
  
You'd give everything you own,  
Saddle blanket, rope, and coat,  
To be sitting by your side  
Right at Christmas time,  
And you'll never be alone.  
  
Riding life for months on end  
Is sure to set you thinking too much.  
Been so long i can't remember when  
The last time i felt your touch.  
  
Though you're aching to the bone,  
She loves you more than you will know.  
Tell the trail to go to hell.  
Just sing a noel,  
And you'll never be alone.  
Whoa!  
  
Yeah!  
Riding life for months on end  
Is sure to set you thinking too much.  
It's been so long i can't remember when  
The last time i felt your touch!  
  
Though you're far away from home,  
Where the cold and lonely roam,  
Don't forget the setting sun  
Shines on everyone,  
And you'll never be alone.  
  
I'll be sitting by your side,  
Right at Christmas time,  
And I'll never be alone!

The warmest day of all my life  
You came to me  
I held you in my hands  
And something changed forever  
  
I want you for a better time  
To know the beauty of our Mother Earth  
Cherish her forever  
  
Never felt in such a hurry  
So little time, so much to do  
I lie awake and dream the dreams I'll share with you  
  
[Chorus]  
This is your world now  
No one can chase all your fears away  
This is your world now  
Trust in your heart to lead the way  
  
I still recall a day so clear  
I saw the future in my mother's eyes  
Filled with tears of sorrow  
  
The years roll by, the times do change  
The truth around us harder to disguise  
As we face tomorrow  
  
So many promises were made me  
So little hope remains alive  
I only pray the dreams I leave you will survive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'll see what I'm saying  
When you're on your own  
The war that you're facing  
Isn't yours alone  
  
I'm a man in search of reasons  
Though I am still as much to blame  
It's up to me leave you more than just my name  
  
This is your world now  
No one can chase all your fears away  
Fight for your world now  
I know that somehow you'll find your way  
Trust your heart to lead the way  
This is your world now  
I want to chase all your fears away  
Fight for your world now  
I know that somehow you'll find your way
