I was getting kinda tired  
Of her endless chatter  
Nothing I could say  
Ever seemed to matter  
So I took a little drive  
Just to clear my head  
I saw a flashing neon, up ahead  
It looked like a place  
To find some satisfaction  
With a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
I paid the man at the door  
And pushed my way to the bar  
Shouted for a drink  
Over a screaming guitar  
A drunk on a stool  
Tried to mess with my head  
But I didn't even listen  
To a word he said  
I knew somewhere  
Amid all this distraction  
Was a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
A little less talk  
If you please  
A lot more loving  
Is what I need  
Let's get on down  
To the main attraction  
With a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
Well she was fighting them off  
At a corner table  
She had a longneck bottle  
She was peeling the label  
The look on her face  
It was perfectly clear  
She said, somebody please  
Get me, out of here  
The look she shot me  
Through the glass refraction  
Said a little less talk  
And a lot more action  
  
A little less talk  
If you please  
A lot more loving  
Is what I need  
Let's get on down  
To the main attraction  
With a little less talk  
And a lot more action

Hoverin' by my suitcase  
Tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night  
A heavy rain a fallin' seems  
I hear your voice a callin' it's all right  
On this rainy night in Georgia  
A rainy night in Georgia  
  
I believe it's rainin' all over the world  
Neon signs a flashin' taxicabs and buses  
Passin' through the night  
The distant moanin' of a train  
Seems to play a sad refrain onto the night  
On this rainy night in Georgia  
Such a rainy night in Georgia  
  
I think, it's rainin' all over the world  
How many times I have wondered  
But it always comes out the same  
No matter how I look at it'll think about it  
It's just like some of its pleasures  
Some of its pain  
  
I find me a place in a boxcar  
So I take out my guitar to pass some time  
Late at night when it's hard to rest  
I hold your picture to my chest  
And then I'm all right  
But it's still a rainy night in Georgia  
It's a rainy night in Georgia  
  
I believe it must be rainin' all over this world  
All over the world rainy night in Georgia

I guess I'll get a cab and go by in my house today  
  
No I can't visit her or my son I'm supposed to stay away  
  
But it won't hurt to bring back old memories  
  
Cause after all they used to all belong to me  
  
Now there's our car the one that I'm still payin' for  
  
And in the front yard Lord I see my little boy  
  
And there's his mother I hope she's doing fine  
  
Oh Lord I'd give anything if they were all still mine  
  
But they're not and I'm the one to blame  
  
I should have known I'd never win when I played that cheating game  
  
This other man holds my life and my son calls him daddy tonight  
  
But how can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to me  
  
How can I complain cause after all they used to all belong to me

No one to talk with, all by myself  
No one to walk with, but I'm happy on the shelf  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you  
  
Now I know for certain, you're the one I love  
I'm through with flirtin', just you I'm dreamin' of  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner in the corner  
Don't go no where, why do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waiting for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late, I don't care to go  
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you  
  
Like Jack Horner in the corner  
Don't go no where, why do I care?  
Your kisses are worth waiting for  
Believe me  
  
I don't stay out late, I don't care to go  
I'm home about eight, just me and my radio  
Ain't misbehavin', savin' my love for you

One day I have ham and bacon  
And the next day it ain't nothing shakin'  
And it ain't noboady's business if I do what I do  
  
Me and my babe oh we fuss and fight  
And the next minute, yea everything is alright  
And it ain't nobody's business what we do  
(Cause that's all private stuff)  
  
One day I think I'm going crazy  
And the next day I'm laid back and lazy  
And it ain't nobody's business if I do  
  
One day I might take a notion  
To go right down and jump in the ocean  
And it ain't nobody's business if I do

The darkness of my world was all cleared away  
The flowers are blooming, it's a beautiful day  
There's a girl with a heart as big as the sky  
She's sunshine and I know why  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
Though sunshine can always make my days seem bright  
Sunshine can warm up a cold, cold night  
I know my sunshine was sent from above  
An angel that's filled with love  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
Through winter, the springtime, the summer and fall  
The moonlight, the starlight, she outshines them all  
In a world filled with fear, with pain and such harm  
My sunshine can't be so warm  
  
Now I live, all for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
The Lord smiled down on this life of mine  
And sent me the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine  
All for the love of sunshine

Let's take the final step and get married cause a true love is all I'm looking

Well I hope someday that I'll make you a million

But I've got two arms that were made just to hold you tight  
  
And a real love to keep you satisfied

Right now all that I can give you is my heart

I just had to show 'em I didn't need 'em and so I headed out west to see some
old friends of mine.  
I thought if I'd climb up ole Ajax mountain maybe that would help me get it
all off my mind.  
I made it up to the top, picked out a clear spot. I thought a whole lot about
the rest of my life.  
I had no idea then soon it would nearly end up on this mountainside I would
nearly die.  
and there all in Alabama and there all in dixieland.  
God I'm dying here in Montana please Lord, just want to go back to hold her
hand just let me get back to my old homeland.  
They said I'd never sing again I learned a lot about my friends 'cause when
your shot down and out you don't get many calls  
but I saw some tears in some eyes and soon my poor old mother would die I
nearly lost it all when I lost my Grandpa.  
But you could find us all in Alabama yeah we're all down in Dixieland  
I didn't die out in Montana No Lord you let me get back to my own homeland and
I'm gonna hold on to her hand.  
I done a whole searching a whole lot of hurtin' before I finally found my road
in life  
you got to say things you want to say go on and do things your own way you can
climb any old mountain once you make up your mind  
and I made mine in Alabama and I found mine down in Dixieland  
I didn't die out in Montana no Lord you let me get back to my ole homeland and
I'm gonna hold on to her hand.

All my rowdy friends have settled down and it seems to be more in the laid
back songs.  
Nobody wants to get drunk and get loud. Everybody just wants to go back home.  
I myself have seen my wilder days and I have seen my name at the top of the
page,  
But I need to find a friend just to run around. But no one wants to get high
on the town  
And all my rowdy friends have settled down.  
  
And I think I know what my father meant when he sang about a lost highway and
old George Jones I'm glad to see he's finally getting straight,  
And Waylon staying home and loving Jesse more these days,  
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have
settled down.  
  
And the hang overs hurt more then they used to and corn bread and ice tea took
the place of pills and ninety-proof,  
And it seems like none of us do things quite like we used to do  
And nobody wants to get high on the town and all my rowdy friends have settled
down.  
  
Yeah I think I know what my father meant when he sang about his lost highway
and Johnny Cash don't act like he did back in '68  
And Kriss he is a movie star and he's moved off to L. A.  
And nobody wants to get drunk and get loud and all my rowdy friends have
settled down  
  
Yeah me and my rowdy friends have rowdied on down.

I went down to the river to watch the fish swim by  
But I got to the river so lonesome I wanted to die, oh Lord!  
And then I jumped in the river, but the river was dry.  
  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.  
  
I had me a man who couldn't be true.  
He made me for my money and she made me blue.  
A woman needs a man that he can lean on,  
But my leanin' post is done left and gone.  
  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.  
  
I'm gonna find me a river, one that's cold as ice.  
And when I find me that river, Lord I'm gonna pay the price, Oh Lord!  
I'm goin' down in it three times, but Lord I'm only comin' up twice.  
  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.  
  
He told me on Sunday he was checkin' me out,  
Long about Monday he was nowhere about.  
And here it is Tuesday, ain't had no news.  
I got them gone but not forgotten blues.  
He's long gone, and now I'm lonesome blue.

Well, I ain't been home for so doggone long  
I almost forgot where I come from  
Ain't got no money but I still ain't a bum  
I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
A back last summer down by the sea  
I seen a pretty girl in  
I snapped my fingers, said son of a gun  
She's almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live  
Sometimes I pick, sometimes I give  
People say I'm a bum  
I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
I met a pretty girl up in Chicago  
She said, honey baby, I love you so  
She begged me to stay and not act like a bum  
I've been almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Friends ask me why I don't take a wife  
Settle down to a married life  
They say it's good as most and it's better than some  
I say I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live  
  
Just the other night out in Tucson  
I had a little date with a great big blonde  
I took her home, she said didn't we have fun  
Hmm, almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
When it's time for the final date with  
Old Saint Pete's at the pearly gate  
He'll say I hope you're ready for your time's come  
I'll say I'm almost nearly but not quite plumb  
  
Some people wonder how I live

Now this ain't no cheating song, cause I didn't do nothing  
Last night all alone in a honky tonk barroom  
I met a girl with a drink of beam in her hand  
She had ruby red lips and coal black, black hair  
And eyes that would tempt any honky tonk man  
Then she came and sat down at my table  
And as she placed her soft hands in mine  
I found myself wanting to kiss her  
For temptation was flowing like cheap honky tonk wine  
  
And I was almost persuaded to strip myself of my pride  
Almost persuaded to push my conscience aside  
  
Then we danced and she whispered I need you  
Take me away from here and be my big ol' southern man  
Then I looked into her eyes and I saw that look and  
I saw something else the reflection of my wedding band  
  
And I was almost persuaded to stip myself of my pride  
Almost persuaded but your sweet love made me stop and go home  
  
That was really hard to do

If you fly in from Birmingham you'll get the last gate,  
If you blew in from Boston, no, you sure won't have to wait,  
And I'm learning, a little more every day,  
About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars,  
And the good old American way.  
  
I've noticed I don't get much help when they see my blue jeans,  
Some slick with a suit walks up, "Oh, can I help you please?"  
Yes, I'm learning, as I gain a little age,  
About the power of the dollar, and the people with white collars,  
And the good old American way.  
  
Some high society lady says, " Is your horse outside?"  
"No, ma'am he's between my legs, but you're too fat to ride!"  
And you're learning, a little more about my ways,  
And what I think about your dollar and your white collar,  
And your good old American way.  
  
If you don't like my Nudie boots, I'm sorry about that,  
Don't make fun of my hat, too, or you might get knocked flat,  
And you'll learn some more, if you ever pass down our way,  
About the folks without the dollars, and without white collars,  
Hell, they are the American way.

Three million megahertz, super-duper processors  
Gotta two hundred gig harddrive  
thirty-two inch screen and a scanner machine  
Boy you wasting too much time  
I say get out of that house  
Pull away from that mouse  
There's a mountain stream calling your name  
Son you been missing  
Some mighty good fishing  
And a whole lot of better things  
  
I'm an American offline  
I'm into having a good time  
It does you good to get some sunshine  
Every once in a while  
Get out and drive your '69  
And sip some honky tonk wine  
Hot women in the nighttime  
I'm an American offline  
  
I got a cabin in the country where I go sometimes  
To clear my head and get away  
Got my channel on TV, no laptop for me  
Cold beer, smile on my face  
Now take my advice  
You better think twice  
Before you turn that damn computer up  
There's so much more to see than that old office routine  
So forget all that logon stuff  
  
Be an American offline  
Go out and have yourself a good time  
Now don't you think you need some sunshine  
On that lily white business suit skin  
Why don't you go and get a beach front room  
Make some noise and wear your hat in the pool  
Make some love in the day time  
Be an American offline  
  
Randall  
  
Go and play that slide guitar  
Check out those hot Atlanta bars  
Meet some friends and make some homemade wine, til the sunshines

Now Amos Moses was a Cajun  
He lived by himself in the swamp  
He hunted alligator for a living  
He just knock them in the head with a stump  
  
Louisiana law gonna get ya Amos  
It ain't legal huntin' alligator  
Down in the swamp now  
Well everyone blamed his old man  
For making him mean as a snake  
When Amos Moses was a boy  
His Daddy would use him for alligator bait  
  
Tie a rope the neck and chunk him out in the swamp  
Alligator bait in a Louisiana bayou  
About 45 minutes southeast of Tibado Louisiana  
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap  
And his pretty white Hannah  
They raised up a son who could  
Eat his weight in groceries  
They named him after a man of cloth  
Called him Amos Moses  
  
Now the folks around South Louisiana  
Thought Amos was a hell of a man  
He could trap the biggest meanest alligator  
And just use one hand  
That's all he got left  
Cause the alligator bit it  
Left on gone, clean up to the elbow  
  
Well the sheriff got wind that Amos  
Was in the swamp hutnin' alligator skin  
So he snuck in the swamp  
Tried to get the boy  
And he never came out again  
  
Well I wonder where the  
Louisiana sheriff went too?  
You can sure get lost in the Louisiana bayou  
About 45 minutes southeast of Tibado Louisiana  
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap  
And his pretty white Hannah  
They raised up a son who could  
Eat his weight in groceries  
They named him after a man of cloth  
Called him Amos Moses  
  
Sit down on em Amos  
  
About 45 minutes southeast of Tibado Louisiana  
Lived a man named Doc Mill Sap  
And his pretty white Hannah  
They raised up a son who could  
Eat his weight in groceries  
They named him after a man of cloth  
Called him Amos Moses  
  
His name is Amos Moses

Lord I'm singing You this message up to Heaven  
Asking you to send me down another angel  
I've been looking for a long time for someone to get her off my mind  
But you know Lord, angels are hard to find  
  
I want an angel with arms and not with wings  
Someone that I can call my darling  
If You can think of someone to fit that description  
Lord could You help me one more time?  
But I know Lord, angels are hard to find  
  
It's my fault I lost the first one You sent to me  
I didn't know 'til she was gone how much she meant to me  
She loved me but I was blind, I bet I do a whole lot better next time  
But I know Lord, angels are hard to find  
  
I want an angel with arms and not with wings  
Someone that I can call darling  
If You can think of someone to fit my description  
Lord, could You help ole Hank one more time?  
But I know Lord, yeah angels are hard to find  
One like that right there Lord, angels are hard to find

Now I met an old friend  
In the bar the other night  
And he got a little drunk  
And he wanted to fight  
And he jumped up  
And challenged every man in the room  
And just about the time he got the words out  
An 'ol boy jumped up and closed his mouth  
And used his head for a mop  
And his butt for a broom  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
I guess it was his first time  
An attitude adjustment  
Now he understands just fine  
He got bent out of shape  
And he opened his mouth  
And just one appointment  
Straightened him right out  
It was an adttitude adjustment  
Oh It'll work every time  
  
Well I've got this big 'ol brother-in-law  
And me and him just never did get along  
Because he wants to make sure  
I'm treating his sister right  
He got drunk one night  
And started beating me up  
And I went and got a tire tool  
Out of my truck  
And laid him out as cold as a block of ice  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
And it will work every time  
An attitude adjustment  
I made him see the light  
And he says I'm his kind of man  
And he comes around with his hat in his hand  
It was an attitude adjustment  
I cured all his family pride  
  
Now my girlfriend slapped me in the face  
I said darlin that was you're first mistake  
Then she went wild and her eyes turned red  
She started breaking everything  
And sceaming loud  
And kickin me and cussin me out  
And I gave her a little adjustment  
On the top of the head  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
Now she loves on me all the time  
Just an attitude adjustment  
She got a whole new frame of mind  
She don't nag  
And I don't beg  
And we get along and like I said  
Just an attitude adjustment  
Oh everythings just fine  
Well almost  
  
She called the cops to take me in  
And I said you're never gonna do it friend  
And they just smiled  
And said "Oh Yes We Will"  
Now a stick to the head  
And some kicks in the chin  
And a several bites from Rin Tin Tin  
And I couldn't wait to get into that jail  
  
It was an attitude adjustment  
Oh I went along peacfully  
Attitude adjustment  
Oh they made me cleary see  
Cause my head is black  
And my legs are blue  
And both knee caps are bent clean through  
It was an attitude adjustment  
It made my whole outlook brand new  
Just a attitude adjustment  
It made my whole outlook brand new

If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love  
If you're happy with me like I'm happy with you  
Old Cupid just gave us a shove  
If you're thinkin' of me like I'm thinkin' of you  
Then I know what you're thinkin' of  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love  
I run around in circles  
And turn in fire alarms  
I'm nutty as a fruit-cake  
When you're not in my arms  
If you're meant for me like I'm meant for you  
Baby, we fit like a glove  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love  
If you're countin' on me like I'm countin' on you  
Old Cupid just gave us a shove  
If you're dreamin' of me like I'm dreamin' of you  
Then I know what you're dreamin' of  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love  
My folks think I've gone crazy  
And I don't feel too sure  
And yet there's nothin' wrong with me  
That weddin' bells won't cure  
If you go for me like I go for you  
Baby, we fit like a glove  
If you're lovin' me like I'm lovin' you  
Baby, we're really in love  

The old guitar picker had run out of liquor  
So I sat down beside him and bought him a drink  
I bought him another and finally some color  
Returned to his cheeks, and he said with a wink  
Son, I worked for Red Foley, knew Hank and Old Lefty  
I worked on the Opry back when I was strong  
But in showbiz you know sometimes it gets slow  
So you buy us another and I'll sing you a song  
Be careful who you love, for love can be untrue  
Be careful who you love, be sure she loves you too

Been there,done that.Every spot on the map.

Guess there's only one thing. Keeps a man like me going.  
Gets my attention right now.Well, you know what I'm talking about,  
A pretty green eyed queen dolled up in tight jeans.  
It makes my heart beat fast,'cause I've been there and done that.  
Been there,done that.Every joint on the map.  
See these lines on my face and these guitar pickin' fingers way out of place.  
I got mud on my hat.I've been blessed and cussed at.  
Don't put up with no crap.  
Been there,done that

Where is the love that we once knew  
There were no hang-ups between me and you  
Where are the words we use to speak  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Where's the good loving you use to give  
Alone is a bad bad way to live  
Arms so soft, lips so sweet  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Where are the walks we use to take  
Where are the plans we use to make  
Where are the dreams we use to dream  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Where are the laughs use to have  
Why did the good times turn into the bad  
Where are the mornings we use to see  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
Where are the nights we'd stay awake  
Where is the love we use to make  
Where's your body so eager and free  
Before you fell out of love with me  
  
I was just thinnking how life use to be  
Before you fell out of love with me

Oh the clock here in the barroom says its half past nine.  
That's usually how long it takes me to drink my first bottle of wine.  
Yes every fifteen minutes, I can drink another bottle down  
And get fifteen minutes closer to that cold,cold ground, to that cold cold
ground.  
Well I think I'll play the jukebox and light up another cigarette  
They say for every puff of that loving smoke you get another minute closer to
death.  
Well I smoke two or three packs a day and my arithmetic is not to sound.  
But I know I'm getting hours closer to that cold,cold ground.  
  
To that cold, cold ground.  
Now this morning I had me a woman and a love so nice and fine.  
But this evening I watched her board that train and move on down the line.  
Our love was so good but now she's gone and this is what I've found.  
Her leaving sure brought me closer to that cold, cold ground.  
  
To that cold, cold ground.  
Well I'm standing in the back alley with a pistol in my hand.  
I never thought a women's love could do this to a man.  
I hear that hammer clickin',what a sweet, terrible sound.  
Let my tombstone read "no liquor, no smoke, no drugs,  
But a woman's love put me in that cold, cold ground.Put me in that cold, cold
ground.

I tried so hard my dear to show that you're my every dream.  
Yet you're afraid each thing I do is just some evil scheme  
A memory from your lonesome past keeps us so far apart  
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart  
  
Another love before my time made your heart sad and blue  
And so my heart is paying now for things I didn't do  
In anger unkind words are said that make the teardrops start  
Why can't you free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart  
  
You'll never know how much it hurts to see you sit and cry  
You know you need and want my love yet you're afraid to try  
Why do you run and hide from lies, to try it just ain't smart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart  
  
There was a time when I believed that you belonged to me  
But now I know your heart is shackled to a memory  
The more I learn to care for you, the more we drift apart  
Why can't I free your doubtful mind, and melt your cold cold heart?

You said you'd never be caught dead  
Listening to people sing with hats on their heads  
Well my how times have changed!  
Did you get tired of heavy metal and chains?  
  
Come breathe the cool mountain air  
Yeah take a look at our pretty girls on display  
Yeah buy a hat, no you won't look like a fool  
'Cause country's hot and country's cool  
  
Come on over to the country  
I think you'll like it here just fine  
Come on over to the country  
We'll try to soothe your rattled mind  
  
Come on over to the country  
Listen to our people sing  
Come on over to the country  
You might find we're to your liking  
  
Don't matter if you're in New York or L. A.  
We'll take you to Montana from the freeway  
Come ride with us down the radio way  
We're here 24 hours a day  
  
Yeah my girl used to be a rock and roll queen  
That was until the night she heard Bocephus sing  
She married me and she moved to the country  
Why she even had cow poo on her jeans, ooh  
  
Come on over to the country  
I think you'll like ti here just fine  
Come on over to the country  
We'll try to soothe your rattled mind

Hank, let's talk about your daddy  
Tell me how your mama loved that man  
Well, just break out a bottle, hoss  
I'll tell you bout the driftin' cowboy band  
  
We won't talk about the habits  
Just the music and the man, that's all  
  
Now Hank, you just got to tell me  
Did your daddy really write all them songs? Did he?  
That don't deserve no answer, hoss  
Let's light up and just move along  
  
Do you think he wrote 'em about your mama  
Or about the man who done her wrong, you know that  
  
Yeah, back then they called him crazy  
Nowadays they call him a saint  
Now the ones that called him crazy  
Are still ridin' on his name  
  
Well, if he was here right now, Bocephus  
Would he think that we were right? Do you think he might?  
Don't you know he would Watasha  
Be right here by our side  
  
If we left for a show in Provo  
  
He'd be the first one on the bus and ready to ride, [Incomprehensible]  
  
Wherever he is I hope he's happy  
You know I hope he's doin' well, yes I do  
He is 'cause he's got one arm around my mama now  
And he sure did love Miss Audrey and raisin' hell  
  
I won't ask you no more questions  
To the stories only Hank could tell  
[Incomprehensible]  
  
Back then they called him crazy  
Nowadays they call him a saint  
Most folks don't know that they fired him from the Opry  
And that caused his greatest pain  
  
I loved to tell you about lovesick  
How Miss Audrey loved that man  
You know I've always loved to listen  
To the stories about that driftin' cowboy band and the man  
  
You know when we get right down to it  
Still the most wanted outlaw in the land, yeah, woh

The preacher man says it's the end of time  
And the Mississippi River she's a goin'dry  
  
The interest is up and the stock market's down  
And you only get mugged if you go down town  
  
I live back in the woods you see  
My woman and the kids and the dogs and me  
  
I've got a shotgun a rifle and a four wheel drive

Country folks can survive  
  
I can plow a field all day long  
I can catch catfish from dusk til dawn, yeah  
  
We make our own whiskey and our own smoke too  
Ain't too many things these ole boys can't do  
  
We grow good ole tomatoes and homemade wine  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
Because you can't starve us out and you can't make us run  
Cause we'se them ole boys raised on shotguns  
We say grace and we say ma'am  
If you ain't into that we don't give a damn  
  
We come from West Virginia coal mines  
And the Rocky Mountains and the western skies  
  
And we can skin a buck, we can run a trot line  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
I had a good friend in New York City  
He never called me by my name, just hillbilly  
  
My Grandpa taught me how to live off the land  
And his taught him to be a business man  
  
He used to send me pictures of the broadway nights  
And I'd send him some homemade wine  
  
But he was killed by a man with a switchblade knife  
For forty three dollars, my friend lost his life  
  
I'd love to spit some beechnut in that dude's eyes  
And shoot him with my ole 45  
Cause a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
  
Cause you can't starve us out and you can't make us run  
Cause we'se them ole boys raised on shotguns  
We say grace and we say ma'am  
If you ain't into that, we don't give a damn  
  
We're from North California and South Alabam  
And little towns all around this land  
  
And we can skin a buck and run a trot line  
And a country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive  
Country boy can survive  
Country folks can survive

Oh, show me a home with a back breakin' lawn  
And a wife that nudge night and day  
And I'll show you a man with a drink in his hand  
Who stands over the jukebox and plays  
  
Country music, those tear jerking songs  
About life the way it really is  
He's not happy at home so he'll play them old songs  
And dance with someone that's not his  
  
When the man of the house has trouble with his spouse  
And she locks him out of the bedroom  
He'll just stroll down the street and some darlings he'll meet  
To have a drink and play them old tune  
  
Country music, those tear jerking songs  
About life the way it really is  
He's not happy at home so he'll play them old songs  
And dance with someone that's not his  
  
So take my advice and go out tonight  
To your favorite honky tonk bar  
Play some Haggard and Tubb or Jones  
Or Acuff or your's truly H W J are  
Or anyone else just as long as it's  
  
Country music those tear jerking songs  
About life the way it really is  
Have a good time tonight and hope  
That your wife don't ever find out what you did

That hot old summer sun make you beg for your next breath  
So you best be on the creek bank laid in the shade  
Chewin on a hickory twig, pass that bottle, I'll have me a swig  
I ain't got a lot, but I think I got it made, in the shade  
  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
Catchin these fish like they're goin out of style  
Drinkin this homemade wine  
Hey, if the sun don't come up tomorrow  
People, I've had a good time  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
  
I bet the old man's in the kitchen  
He's got my kind of music on his radio  
Oh, drinkin his beer and dialin up the request line  
Momma and old Aunt Joan  
Probably in the dining room tryin to use the phone  
Me, I'm thinkin about that girl and later tonight  
Oh, yeah  
  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
Hey, I'm atchin these fish like they're goin out of style  
I'm drinkin this homemade wine  
And if the sun don't come up tomorrow  
People, I've had a good time  
I'm just laid up here in a country state of mind  
  
You know, the red necks and the hippies  
They are in their discos and honkytonks  
Somewhere between raising hell and amazing grace  
Lord, I know just how they feel  
You gotta get out and kick up your heels  
And ain't it great to be livin in the usa  
  
Me, I'm laid up here in a country state of mind  
Catchin these fish like they're goin out of style  
And drinkin this homemade wine, all the time

(I know where Hank Jr is)  
  
Yodel-ay-ee-oh, yodel-ay-ee-oh  
Yodel-ay-ee-hee

There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost y two friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and there's curves  
But the one we got to observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime, night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the side of the highway  
  
Now Derrick Thomas was a champion no one can deny that  
He led the Alabama Crimson Tide in all time total sacks  
But his heart was even bigger than all his natural skill  
He always helped kids in the city and you know what  
I think he always will  
Now my buddy Mike Tellis was a good man everyone loved him so  
He took care of his dear father 'til he too was called to go  
How my little girl cried when we all got the dreaded news  
She said but Daddy Derrick and Mike will always be with us  
Don't children always tell the truth  
  
I never paid no attention anytime I passed one by  
Oh but now I say a prayer because now I know why  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken to a better world  
Oh there's stop signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
I saw it in the morning paper we hear it on the evening news  
A mother, a child, a family life sometimes can be mighty cruel  
So God help us through these troubled times  
And please bless us with peace of mind  
There's just a shell there in the grave for the soul has flown away  
  
There's a cross on the highway where the tragic wreck occurred  
And I lost my two good friends taken from this mean old world  
Oh there's warning signs and curves but the one we must observe  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway  
  
Always bow your head and pray, anytime night or day  
Whenever you see a cross on the highway

Cry cry darling that's what I do if you'd leave me with the blues  
Cry cry darling that's all I do if it's you I should lose  
For me there'd be no moonlight if ever we should part  
Cry cry darling that's what I do cause you're the one in my heart  
  
Cry cry darling my eyes will cry and never dry if you should go  
Cry cry darling when shadows creep I'll just weep all night I know  
You know how much I'd miss you if ever we should part  
Cry cry darling that's all I do cause you're the one in my heart

It was colder than a well digger's ankles in Cutbank, Montana.  
But my heart was on fire as I saw her step down from the train.  
I'd been up there forever, but her arms were finally around me.  
All my icicles melted away at the sound of her name.  
  
I held her to me as tightly as I held her letter,  
That said "I don't love him. I'm leaving this cold mean man."  
As the train pulled away from the platform  
And I put her in the wagon,  
With her head on my shoulder, God knows I was one happy man.  
  
And I went to heaven that night in her arms in my cabin.  
In the winter of '94 there burned such a powerful flame.  
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank, Montana.  
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name.  
  
Hell rode into town one night on a Wyoming stallion.  
His heart full of hate and his eyes full of cold jealousy.  
"One way or another," he said,  
"partner, I'm taking back my woman."  
With my hand on my gun, I said, "Don't bet your life.  
The lady says she's staying with me."  
His knife was a flash in the light of the kerosene lantern  
That fell as we tangled and fought in the fire on the floor.  
He was a dead man, but I have been too since I lost her.  
From the fire that burned me so bad as I crawled through the door.  
  
But I went to heaven that night in her arms in my little cabin.  
In the winter of '94, there burned one hell of a flame.  
They still hear her voice in the cabin in Cutbank, Montana.  
And the icicles all melt away at the sound of her name.  
They still hear her voice from the cabin in Cutbank, Montana,  
And the icicles all just melt away at the sound of her name.

I got some sun tan oil  
And a rebel flag  
Stuck a Florida road map  
In my saddle bag  
I think Panama City  
Would be a good place to start  
On this little vacation  
To loosen up my heart  
Orange blossom trail  
Over in Orlando  
I've heard some wild tales about the women there standing out on the road  
And when you leave out of there  
On a midnight ride  
Take that highway down to that famous town on the ocean side  
  
Daytona nights  
They make you dance  
All the girls got that centerfold pose  
And they all got a tan  
And if they're looking for love  
It's like a rising tide  
And they will swallow you up like sand to the hubs, daytona nights  
  
Now the Boothill Saloon  
And the Last Resort  
That's a few of the sites  
You need to be looking for  
Hawaian tropic women  
They got the best buns of all  
I like the way they sway when they walk up and say,  
"hey and how are y'all"  
So we swim all day  
And we played all night  
And I never want to leave this free as a breeze, daytona nights  
  
Daytona nights  
Sure make you dane  
All these girls got that centerfold pose  
And they all got a tan  
And if they're looking for love  
It's like a rising tide  
They will swallow you up like sand to the hubs, daytona nights  
  
Yes if they're looking for love  
It's like a stormy tide  
They will swallow you up like sand to the hubs, daytona nights  
Stuck in those daytona nights  
  
Here comes the tide

I Come Home Late At Night  
With My Boots In My Hand  
Stumble In The Back Door  
Being Quite As I Can  
And I Know She's There In Bed  
Cold And All Alone  
And She's Cryin'  
Because I'm Breaking Up Our Home  
  
[Chorus:]  
And She Knows  
The Hell I'm Going Through  
In This World  
Inside My Head  
There's A Devil  
In The Bottle  
And He Want's  
To See Me Dead  
I Fall Into Her Arms  
And She Helps Me With My Clothes  
I Guess She Stays On With Me  
Because She Really Knows  
That I'm Tryin' Lord  
To Find My Freedom  
By Escaping To The Only  
Freedom I've Ever Known  
  
Repeat [Chorus:]  
  
Yes,There's A Devil  
In The Bottle  
And He Want's  
To See Me Dead  
And It's Killing Her  
Watching Me Die This Way

Hey man them ain't high heeled sneakers  
And they sure don't look like cowboy boots  
And that ain't rock and roll your playin  
And it sure ain't country or rhythm and blues  
Your singing a song about making love to your drummer  
Well gay guitar pickers don't turn me on  
And we don't all get in to Donna summers  
Do you happen to know any old Hank Williams songs!  
  
Cause you see I'm a dinosaur  
I should have died out a long time before  
Have Pitty on a dinosaur  
Hand me my hat excuse me maam  
But where's the door!  
  
Used to be I had a lot of fun in the old hangout  
We'd get stoned at the jukebox to stay out of fights  
Now and then we'd light a little smoke  
In the truck out back!  
And a little old Jim Beam and we'd get right  
And you know these flashing lights sure make me dizzy  
And this disco's very strange to my ears  
Looks like they turned the longhorn into a spaceship  
And I'll be leaving just a soon as I finish this beer  
  
Cause you see I'm a dinosaur  
I should have died out a long time before  
Have Pitty on a dinosaur  
Hand me my hat excuse me mam  
But where's the door!  
  
Give us our hats  
Excuse Me mam  
Where the door!

Well I just got back from the liquer store,  
I bought you some pink champaigne.  
It's early afternoon so why don't you,  
Come over and model these things.  
I forgot to you I stopped at that little,  
Loungerie shop in the mall.  
And the girls showed me this,  
The girls showed me that.  
And baby I bought 'em all.  
  
Now you can put on this garter belt.  
Wear this hot little dress.  
No it doesn't leave much for imagination,  
But it shows off your assets  
I can fix us a drink, while you slip into these things.  
And I'll meet you in the bar at nine.  
Yuo make me wanna' fantasy,  
I've got a dirty mind.  
  
(Ab)Yes it's true. I've got a dirty mind.  
But I saw you enjoy it too, all those men giving you the eye.  
You women are trying to keep us men turned on all the time.  
We hope you never quit, cause we're enjoying it.  
We've all got dirty minds.  
  
Now don't you tell me I'm a dirty devil, through and through,  
Sittin there with your dress hiked up  
All those legs and hose and shoes.  
I heard about your last party, so don't you be judging me.  
You junped up on the table, did a slow strip  
Girl your as bad as me.  
(Repeat3)  
I need a night of counseling, to get my mind off of these things  
I've got a dirty, nasty, rotten, normal mind

All the stations up here don't sign off with Dixie,  
The way they did in sweet home Alabama,  
The people here don't sip Jack Daniels whiskey,  
The way they do in that Tennessee mountain land.  
  
I've always heard lots about the big apple,  
So I thought I'd come up here and see,  
But all I've seen so far is one big hassle,  
Wish I was camped out on the Okeechobee.  
  
If this is the promised land,  
I've had all I can stand,  
And I'm headed back below that Dixie line  
Well I just don't fit in,  
And I'll never come back again,  
I'm busted here with Dixie on my mind,  
Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind.  
  
These people never smile or say a word,  
They're all too busy tryin' to make an extra dime,  
Oh I'd love to haul 'em all down around Spartanburg,  
And show 'em how to raise hell in Carolina.  
  
Oh, the things you know that I miss most of all,  
Is the freedom of the rivers and the pines,  
They don't do much huntin' and fishin' up here ya know,  
But I have met a few squirrels and one porcupine.  
  
If this is the promised land,  
I've had all I can stand,  
Wish I was down in Houston town tonight,  
Well I just don't fit in,  
And I'll never come back again,  
I'm busted here with Dixie on my mind,  
Oh, I'm stuck up here and I got Dixie on my mind.

He wears tall black boots  
Has Porter Wagoner suits  
Got a four wheeler, that's all wrong  
  
Now his palace is a lot  
On a rough, rocky top  
And a bright red bobo on  
  
He flies the red, white and blue  
And I'm telling you  
He knows how to honky tonk all night

All the guys are out of luck  
The girls know his reputation is fine  
  
He's Don Juan D'Bubba  
He's got a Spanish mother  
But his daddy worked in a coal mine  
  
He cooks squirrel hors d'oeuvres

He's nobody's fool  
If there's a party  
He's the first to be found  
  
Don Juan D'Bubba  
The hillbilly lover  
Blue Ribbon country hound  
  
He's a playboy true  
And he pitches his woo  
To a different girl every night  
  
He's a practical joker  
A smooth talkin' stroker  
A real man if you want a fight  
  
And when he gets on a roll  
He puts on a show  
Barnum and Bailey ain't never seen  
  
He is fine and dandy  
Handsome and handy  
Bubba's in every country girl's dream  
  
He's Don Juan D'Bubba  
He's got a Spanish mother  
But his daddy worked in a coal mine

Now he's cool as a rule  
Nobody's fool  
Make him the man you don't want to be around  
  
Don Juan D'Bubba  
The legendary lover  
Blue Ribbon country hound

I guess you noticed there is only eleven roses  
I chose them from our garden where they grew  
Take the roses and look into the mirror  
And the twelfth rose will be looking back at you  
  
There's just something about a spray of roses  
To a woman, they say more than man can say  
After what I've done, you may not keep the roses  
But I just thought I would send them anyway

Well here we are smack in the middle of the 90's high tech age  
We got lasers, cds, microchips, and fat free fat these days  
Well that's all fine but I got a mind that's changing to fast for me  
'Cause what I thought was new last month this month is history  
I got a brand new vcr, it's got 29, 000 functions  
And I can't make the damn thing work so there goes Petticoat Junction  
That's when I got the best idea I think I had in years  
I think I'll be cool and invent the tool that'll fax me a beer  
  
Would you all please fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on it's ear  
Yeah, makin' old whiskey that was riskey but this is all in the clear  
Sit back, relax, and punch ol' fax and I'll fax you a beer  
  
Japan and Germany they got nothing on us you see  
Why this is the latest and good ol' American high technology  
And when this hits the marketplace Uncle Sam will rule the world  
Well hold on cause I'm working on a machine that'll faxa real live girl  
  
Would you all please fax me a beer  
This invention is gonna set the whole world on it's ear  
The old office code will never quite bet the same  
When it come cold and clear  
Sit back, relax, and punch ol' fax and I'll fax you a beer  
  
Would you like me to fax me a beer

Sit back, relax, and punch ol' fax and I'll fax you a beer  
Sit back and drank and give thanks to Hank and I'll fax you a beer

You're one in a million, a hundred to one shot  
I took a gamble and just lookie here what I got  
A diamond in the middle of a field full of stone  
And I'm bettin' everything I got  
Hey, that you can keep me comin' home  
  
Finders are keepers  
And I'm keeping you as long as I can  
Finders are keepers  
So baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand  
  
A needle in a haystack would be easy to do  
Compared to me finding somebody else like you  
I tell you chasing the perfect woman is just like rolling the dice  
She's as pretty as a natural eleven  
And I'm puttin' my heart on the line  
  
Finders are keepers  
And I'm keeping you as long as I can  
Finders are keepers  
So baby, don't ever stop, just keep on holdin' my hand  
  
Finders are keepers  
So baby, keep on keepin' on with your lovin' man

It was hard for him to get out of bed  
When the phone rang, sleep-eyed she said  
Charlie's drunk again  
Why don't you just let it ring  
Through the years he'd always picked it up  
For the guy who came back and saved his butt  
What they have in common is a brotherhood  
So few could understand  
  
[Chorus]  
They were forged by fire  
Hard times you get beyond  
Gives you an unbreakable bond  
Forged by fire  
When you pray to god, bet the odds  
And walk through hell together  
You're forever  
Forged by fire  
  
The young GI said from his VA bed  
Why you wanna hang out with us broken men  
When you could be spending your time with your family and friends  
He told him son, you're family too  
I see myself when I look at you  
In a place and time you don't forget  
And even tho we've just met  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He said goodbye GI see you next week  
Then he rolled himself out to the street  
It was pretty hard for him to get his van  
And throw the wheelchair in the back  
He was headed home ready to unwind  
Charlie called can you help me one more time  
He said Chuck, I'll be there on the double  
For a brother, it's no trouble  
  
[Chorus]

Oh the games people play now  
Every night and every day now  
Never meaning what they say now  
Never saying what they mean  
So they while away the hours  
In their ivory towers  
Till there covered up with flowers  
In the back of a black limousine  
  
[Chorus]  
Talking bout you and me  
And the games people play  
  
Oh we make one another cry  
Break our heart  
Then we say goodbye  
Cause our heart say  
We hope to die  
Let the other one to blame  
Neither one will ever give in  
So were gazing at an 8 by 10  
Thinking bout the way  
It might have been  
Its a dirty, rotten, shame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
People walking up to ya  
Saying glory, hallelujah  
And they try to sock it to ya  
In the name of the Lord  
They gonna teach you  
How to meditate  
Read your horoscope  
And cheat your faith  
And furthermore to hell with hate  
Come on and get on board  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look around tell me  
What you see  
Whats happening to you and me  
God grant me the serenity  
To remember who I am  
Cause your giving up your sanity  
For your pride and your vanity  
Turn your back on humanity  
And you don't give a damn  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

Well, I was born at a party in a barn  
With a guitar strapped across my arm  
So I learned to play in a different style  
Everyone knows that I'm hog wild  
  
Well, I pick it high and I pick it low  
Pick it with my teeth and pick it with my toe  
You can hear me play for a country mile  
Everybody knows that I'm hog wild  
Everybody knows that I'm hog wild  
  
Well, I laid around on the farm too long  
Me and them city folks couldn't get along  
My momma said, "You're a destined child  
They all know you's born hog wild"  
  
So I traveled all over this land  
And I found myself a back-woods band  
You could hear us play for a country mile  
Everybody knows that we're hog wild  
Yeah, everybody knows that we're hog wild  
  
Everybody knows that we're hog wild  
Everybody knows that we're hog wild  
Everybody knows that I play loud  
Everybody know, everybody knows, everybody knows  
Everybody knows that we're hog wild  
  
Make it wild, make it wild  
Make it wild, make it wild  
Make it wild, make it wild  
Rootin' around town

You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you got  
You had better hold on  
Hold on to what you got  
  
'Cause if you think nobody wants it  
Just throw it away and you will see  
Someone will have it before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, they will  
  
Listen fellas, you know, it's not all the time  
That a man can have a good woman  
A woman that he can call his very own  
A woman who'll stay right there at home  
And mind the children while he's gone to work  
  
A woman who'll have his dinner cooked  
When he comes home  
Where some men make mistakes is when they go out  
And stay because they feel that no other man  
Wants his woman but him, but listen  
  
If you think no other man wants her  
Just throw her away and you will see  
Some man will have her before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, they will, yes, he will  
  
Ha, ha, listen girls, this goes for you, too  
Because you know I've seen so many women  
Who've had so many good men in life  
  
Men who would stand by 'em through thick and thin  
Men who would go to work everyday and bring home  
Their hard earned pay  
Men who would give their women anything that their  
Little heart desired  
  
Where some women make mistakes  
Is when their men go out and let 'em play  
They would stay because they felt that no other  
Woman wanted him but her, listen  
  
If you think that no other woman wants him  
Just pitch him out in the streets and you will see  
Some woman will have your man before you can count  
One, two, three, yes, you will, yes, you will

Homesick and lonely I'm worried and blue  
I want to see the baby and the baby's mama too  
I'm so tired of roamin' I'm about to lose my mind  
Homesick and lonesome for that gal of mine  
Mean old trouble is all that I've known  
I'm missing my honey and boys I'm going home  
If she'll just let me tarry when I come draggin' in  
You couldn't take a shotgun and run me off again  
This old boy's got misery deep down in his soul  
This old world's too big and this old world's too cold  
I'll be ridin' that freight train when she comes down the tracks  
And next time you see me leave I'll be flat on my back  
  
[Fiddle]  
  
I never knew a body could ever feel so low  
I have often asked myself why did I ever go  
I'm a headin' home and this time there I'm gonna park  
And if she wants a new dog then I'm gonna learn to bark  
Homesick and lonely...  
Homesick and lonesome for that gal of mine

Well I left my home down on the rural route  
I told my paw I'm going steppin out and get the  
Honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got 'em,  
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
Well I went to a dance and I wore out my shoes  
Woke up this mornin wishin I could lose  
Them jumpin honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got 'em,  
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
Solo  
  
Well I stopped into every place in town  
This city life has really got me down  
I got the honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got em,  
Got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
I'm gonna tuck my worries underneath my arm  
And scat right back to my pappy's farm  
And leave these honky tonk blues,  
Yeah the honky tonk blues  
Well lord I got 'em,  
I got the ho-on-ky tonk blues.  
  
When I get home to my Ma and Pa,  
I know they're gonna lay down the law.  
About the honky tonk blues,  
Them jumpin' honkty tonk blues.  
Lord I'm suffrin' with the honky tonk blues.

I've been riding this train a long time  
And I'm still trying to unwind  
All my rowdy friends have settled down  
I'm out on the road just looking around  
For that engineer of love to set me free  
'Cause I'm locked up in this world of misery  
  
And we ride on the honky tonk train  
Everynight life in the fast lane  
There's a woman on the dancefloor, she's messing with my brain  
Well here goes my heart, pour on the cold honky tonk train  
  
Everybody's got problems that's no lie  
Everybody's got somebody on their mind  
They wanna get on board and just leave their problems behind  
And their engines are burning hard for honky tonk wine  
So I take my guitar and make that little string moan  
And they're moving on down the line like Casey Jones  
  
Yeah we ride on the honky tonk train  
Everynight life in the fast lane  
There's a woman on the dancefloor, she's messing with my brain  
Here goes my heart, pour on the cold honky tonk train  
  
Yeah we ride on the honky tonk train  
Everynight life in the fast lane  
There's a woman on the dancefloor, she's messing with my brain  
Here goes my heart, pour on the cold honky tonk train  
  
Can I ever get off this honky tonk train  
Everynight I'm living a hard driving fast lane  
Hard driving fast land  
Riding the honky tonk train  
Riding the honly tonk train

I met a gin soaked, bar-room queen in Memphis  
I tried to take her upstairs for a ride  
I had to heave her right across my shoulder  
I just don't seem to drink you off my mind  
  
Honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Strollin' on the boulevards of Paris  
As naked as the day that I will die  
  
The sailors, they're so charming there in Paris  
They just don't seem to sail you off my mind  
  
It's a honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues  
  
Honky tonk, honky tonk women  
Gimme, gimme, gimme the honky tonk blues

(There'll be peace in the valley for him how we pray  
  
I was with Red Foley the night he passed away)  
  
We was down in Port Wayne Indiana the night the Lord took Red away  
  
And we had to get there a little early cause we had a matinee  
  
And when Red first went on stage it seemed that he moved and talked a little
slow  
  
But of course he went on to do his regular great show  
  
So soon the afternoon show was over with and we all went down the street and
ate  
  
Red said he wasn't very hungry but he came along anyway  
  
And we got done eaten and came back to the last show  
  
But the thing just would be Red's very last well who's to know  
  
And when he went on the stage for his own ten thousandth time  
  
We was all back to the curtains there just shootin' the lines  
  
But when he sang Peace In The Valley there was such a quiet still  
  
I know I'll never forget it and anyone that was there never will  
  
Well soon the last show was over with  
  
And I went back to the hotel and Red gave me a call  
  
I told him to come on over I was just starin' at the four walls  
  
So he came over to my room he was just next door there  
  
Lit a cigarette and sat down in the chair  
  
And he started talkin' bout all the worries that a country music singer has  
  
I said old Red I reckon it's not that bad  
  
He said yeah you're workin' a lot now and you'll have 'em some day  
  
Your dad had 'em and I have 'em I guess it's just meant that way  
  
Then he got up and these were the last words he said  
  
I'm awful tired now Hank and I've got to go to bed  
  
And while I layed there with Red just a few steps away  
  
The angels came and took him into the last golden stage  
  
(There'll be peace in the valley for him how we pray  
  
I was with Red Foley the night he passed away)

I've always loved you because you've been so true  
You've always been so kind you've never made me blue  
You're the girl of my dreams and I think it's time you see  
That I can't live without you I wouldn't change a thing  
About you but your name  
Don't answer too quick please think it over dear  
I swear I'd love you forever and the year  
You're the only love I've known I know we'd have a happy home  
No I can't live without you I wouldn't change a thing  
About you but your name  
  
I wouldn't change a thing about you but your name  
And I can't wait until they're both the same  
For your heart's so good and true to your pretty eyes of blue  
No I can't live without you I wouldn't change a thing  
About you but your name

If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made  
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States  
The day Elvis passed away would be our national holiday  
If the South woulda won, we woulda had it made  
  
I'd make my Supreme Court down in Texas  
And we wouldn't have no killers getting off free  
If they were proven guilty, then they would swing quickly  
Instead of writin' books and smilin' on tv  
  
We'd all learn Cajan cookin' in Louisiana  
And I'd put that capital back in Alabama  
We'd put Florida on the right track, 'cause we'd take Miami back  
And throw all them pushers in the slammer  
  
Oh, if the south woulda won, we woulda had it made  
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States  
The day young Skynyrd died, we'd show our southern pride  
If the south woulda won, we woulda had it made  
"Play a little dixieland boys, ah yes"  
  
I'd have all the whiskey made in Tennessee  
And all the horses raised in those Kentucky hills  
The national treasury would be in Tupelo, Mississippi  
And I'd put Hank Williams picture on one hundred dollar bill  
  
I'd have all the cars made in the Carolinas  
And I'd ban all the ones made in China  
I'd have every girl child sent to Georgia to learn to smile  
And talk with that southern accent that drives men wild  
  
I'd have all the fiddles made in Virginia  
'Cause they sure can make 'em sound so fine  
I'm going up on Wolverton Mountain and see ole Clifton Clowers  
And have a sip of his good ole Arkansas wine  
  
Hey, if the South woulda won we'd a had it made  
I'd probably run for President of the Southern States  
When Patsy Cline passed away, that would be our national holiday  
If the South woulda won, we'd a had it made, olay he hee hee  
I said if the South woulda won, we would a had it made  
  
Might even be better off

I don't know how I'll get her ioff my mind  
But give me time and I'll think of something  
I can't say today that I'm alright  
But by tonight I'll think of Something  
  
I'll find so many things to do  
That I won't have the time to think of her  
And then if she's still on my mind  
I'll try to drink enough to drown the hurt  
And if that don't work I'll think of something  
  
Where do I go for love that I still need  
Now that I'm free I'll think of something  
And if someday by accident we meet  
And I can't speak I'll think of something  
  
If I can't say a word to her  
I'll blame it on this lump that's in my throat  
And standing there what will I do  
To hide my love enough that it won't show  
I don't know I'll think of something  
Well, I don't know I'll think of something

Well all you want to do is sit around and pout  
And now I've got enough so I'm gettin' out

That when I get a kiss I think that somethin's wrong

You never shut your mouth until I blow my top

There's a time to laugh and there's a time to cry  
There's a time to live and love but my love for you has died  
I just don't want you anymore although you've done your part  
I can love you out of sympathy I'm gonna break your heart  
I always kinda like you dear and your cute little ways  
  
But I never meant for you to fall in love with me this way  
I should have never let you on and drag your love this far  
I'm sorry dear don't waste your tears I'm gonna break your heart  
The time to laugh is over and the time to cry has come  
  
But we shared a lot of good times I've thought we had a lot of fun  
I've stayed as long as I'm goin' to now I've just got to go  
But darling before I do there's something I want you to know  
I tried to make you happy dear I tried to do my part  
  
But love just died go on and cry I'm gonna break your heart  
But love just died go on and cry I'm gonna break your heart

My good gal left and I can't stand this pain  
When she walked out my teardrops fell like rain  
So set 'em up Joe and give me some dimes  
I've got an appointment with a friend of mine  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
'Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me  
And that whippoorwill ain't got no sympathy  
I'm broken down and torn apart,  
The moanin' blues and your cheatin' heart  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
But lovesick blues sure ain't no state of mind  
Mixed with broken heart and Juke joint wine  
But I ain't leavin', done turned in my keys,  
The bartender told me stay as long as you please  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Ah 'cause those wedding bells will never ring for me  
And that whippoorwill ain't got no sympathy  
I'm broken down and torn apart,  
Whiskey bent and your cheatin' heart  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
'Cause the wedding bells will never ring for me  
Long gone lonesome blues sure fits me to a tee  
I'm broken down and torn apart,  
Whiskey bent and your cheatin' heart  
I'm gonna get drunk and play Hank Williams all night long  
  
Why don't you love me like you used to do  
Yeah all night long

I'm just a man.I breath and I bleed yes I got feelings I can hear and I can

and you are the lady that brings them out of me making me feel special aww
that's your specialty.  
'cause you let me be me and I let you be you.Hey don't that sound so easy but
that is so hard to do.  
Some things make me feel sad. I feel like I could cry, feeling you next to me,
aww, that makes me feel alright!  
I'm not made of steel and I'm not made of stone I'm not a super hero I'm made
of flesh and bone.  
I'm just a man I breath and I bleed yes I've got feelings.I can hear and I can
see,

Did you hear that lonesome whippoorwill?  
He sounds too blue to fly  
The midnight train is whining low  
I'm so lonesome, I could cry  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
When time goes crawling by  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide its face and cry  
  
Did you ever see a robin weep  
When leaves begin to die?  
That means he's lost the will to live  
I'm so lonesome, I could cry  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Light's up a purple sky  
And as I wonder where you are  
I'm so lonesome, I could cry

Some ladies love diamonds  
Fast cars and freedom  
Trips to the island  
Castles in Spain  
Las Vegas card sharks  
Blues men that blow french harps  
But no strings to her heart  
Just the arms of cocaine.  
  
Yeah she likes to run  
With us high riding cowboys  
She says she feels a whole lot  
More at home on the range  
She can handle her feelings  
In most all situations  
She just can not handle  
The arms of cocaine  
  
Hey I'm just a rhymer  
Writing down new phrases  
Looking for ladies  
Who know I'm subject to change  
Content to believing  
The songs I am singing.  
Help her find her feelings  
Help her break the chains of cocaine  
  
Oh my lady is special  
She's into my kind of music  
She likes Jim Beam and water  
Instead of champange  
I like Levi's and leathers  
Making love together  
No more stormy weather  
Since she broke the chains of cocaine  
  
No more stormy weather  
Since she broke the chains of cocaine

There's a big old smokin' crater  
Where our house used to be  
I spent all my pach check  
Buyin' up that T-N-T  
  
I just got back from goodwill'  
Where I dumped all your clothes  
And I fed all your flowers  
To some old billy goat  
  
Now it ain't much but it's all that  
I could think of at the time  
The worst things were the first things  
That came into my mind  
  
I ain't done here enough  
To get you out of my heart  
But at least I'm feelin' better  
What the hell, it's a good start  
  
Pull out a chainsaw to the oak tree  
Where our car bear a name  
Took her back home to your parking spot  
Upon lover's lane  
  
I've been leaving lots of messages  
On those bathroom walls  
With your name and number  
Foursome hot stuff, just call  
  
It ain't much but its all that  
I could think of at the time  
The worst things were the first things  
That came into my mind  
  
I ain't done here enough  
To get you out of my heart  
But at least I feel better  
What the hell, It's a start  
  
I ain't done here enough  
To get you out of my heart  
But at least I'm feelin' better  
What the hell, it's start

It seems that you've changed in these past few days  
For when I try to kiss you you just push me away  
Now I don't know what's wrong but I don't see how we can go on  
I think your love for me is dying and it's all over but the crying  
I called you on the phone just to find out what was wrong  
And the thing you said made my suspicions real  
  
You said tonight again you had to stay with this sick friend  
But that story I'm not buying cause it's all over but the crying  
It's all over but the crying I never would have thought you were lying  
It sounded so true when you said I love you  
Now I say my goodbying cause it's all over but the crying it's all over but
the crying

I've been around.  
I used to sing songs that were hand-me-downs.  
I've been called a hero,  
I've been called a clown.  
I've learned the old ways and the new ways now.  
  
I've been around.  
I can drop names that will knock ya down.  
I've rock and rolled and I've fiddled around,  
From Hollywood to the Nashville sound.  
  
I've been around,  
Climbed the highest mountain I found.  
I went to the top and I fell back down.  
And I know what I'm talking about,  
'Cause I've been around.  
  
I've been in love.  
I've been down on my knees and prayed to God above.  
"Why does so much pain go with so mich love?  
Why is she still the one I'm dreaming of? "  
  
Yeah, I've been around,  
And the best two friends I've ever found  
Are a woman's love and a guitar sound.  
And I know what I'm talking about,  
'Cause I've been around.  
Yeah I've been around.

I've got a right to cry  
I've got a right to cry  
All day I sing the blues  
I'm in my lonely shoes  
  
Could you be so unkind?  
I nearly lost my mind  
I wonder if you care  
My life is a sad affair  
  
My heart is aching and it's breaking  
And I don't know what to do  
Sweetheart, it's all because of you  
  
You know you've done done me wrong  
Come on back home where you belong  
And in this reason why  
I've got a right to cry  
  
Yeah my heart is aching, Lord, it's breaking  
And I don't know what to do  
Sweetheart, don't you know it's all because of you?  
  
You know you've done done me wrong  
Please come back home where you belong  
And in my reason why  
I've got a right to cry  
I've got a right to cry

"I got a past  
That'll last me forever  
And enough memories for one man's life (that is true)  
The one I love  
She ain't comin back ever  
So it looks like I've got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hand  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
O love let me down  
Now a truer friend I've found  
Why I've got my future on ice  
  
There was a time  
She was my one and only  
Until someone else caught her eye  
Then for awhile,  
Can you believe I was acting so lonely?  
Now I've got my future on ice  
  
I got bottles and cans  
That just left my hands  
And a chill to just the right Fahrenheit  
Yes love let me down  
Now a truer friend I found  
Now I've got my future on ice  
  
O love let me down  
Now a real true friend I found  
Why I got my future on ice

Goodbye Joe, me gotta go, me oh my oh

Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.  
Son of a gun, we'll have big fun on the bayou.

But don't turn the light out don't lock the gate  
Forgiveness and patience that's all I need Jesus oh Jesus don't give up on me  
Stand by me Jesus...

This is just another town that I painted  
You're just another girl that were not too well equated  
I'm a drifter at this time and we parted oh but why am I so heavy hearted  
It's just another town on the highway  
Just like a thousand others I passed her goin' my way  
I just came to say goodbye why do I want to cry after all it's just another
town  
That's just another door why can't I open it and go  
If I told you what's in my heart I'm sure that you'd say no  
It's just another town that won't miss me  
You're just another girl that was kind enough to kiss me  
My mind says walk away why does my heart say stay  
After all it's just another town after all it's just another town

I'm a rolling stone, all alone and lost,  
For a life of sin, I have paid the cost.  
When I pass by, all the people say  
"Just another guy on the lost highway."  
  
Just a deck of cards and a jug of wine  
And a woman's lies make a life like mine.  
Oh, the day we met, I went astray,  
I started rollin' down that lost highway.  
  
I was just a lad, nearly twenty-two,  
Neither good nor bad, just a kid like you,  
And now I'm lost, too late to pray,  
Lord, I've paid the cost on the lost highway.  
  
Now, boys, don't start your ramblin' round,  
On this road of sin or you're sorrow bound.  
Take my advice or you'll curse the day  
You started rollin' down that lost highway

I'll keep my freedom  
I'll keep my guns  
Try to keep my money  
And my religion too  
Try to keep on workin'  
Try to keep on smilin'  
I will keep my Christian name  
And y'all can keep the change  
  
I'll keep my heroes  
Pictures on the wall  
I'll keep my family safe  
You bluff when I call  
I'm gonna keep my big V8  
Keep my friends the same  
Keep the government outta my business  
And y'all can keep the change  
  
This country's sure as hell been goin' down the drain  
We know what we need  
We know who to blame  
United Socialist States of America  
How do you like that name?  
I'll keep the USA and y'all can keep the change  
  
So FOX and friends  
Wanna put me down  
Ask for my opinion  
Then twist it all around  
Supposed to be talkin' about my father's new CD  
Well two can play that "Gotcha Game" just wait and see  
Don't tread on me  
  
This country's sure as hell been goin' down the drain  
We know what we need  
We know who to blame  
United Socialist States of America  
Don't ya just love that name?  
I'll keep the USA and y'all can keep the change  
  
I'll keep the USA and y'all can keep the change  
  
Yeah, you can keep FOX and friends and ESPN outta your homes too  
'Cause Bocephus and all his rowdy friends and his song is outta there!  
Yes sir!

I got a little change in my pocket going jingle lingle ling  
Want to call you on the telephone baby I give you a ring  
But each time we talk I get the same old thing  
Always no huggin no kissin until I get a wedding ring  
My honey my baby don't put my love upon no shelf  
She said don't give no lines and keep your hands to yourself  
  
Cruel baby baby baby why you want to treat me this way  
You know I'm still your lover boy I still feel the same way  
That's when she told me a story 'bout free milk and a cow  
And she said no huggin no kissin until I get a wedding vow  
My honey my baby don't put my love upon no shelf  
She said don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself  
  
You see I wanted her real bad and I was about to give in  
That's when she started talkin' true love started talkin' about sin  
I said honey I'll live with you for the rest of my life  
She said no huggin no kissin until you make me your wife  
My honey my baby don't put my love on no shelf  
She don't hand me no lines and keep your hands to yourself.

I'm sittin' in Knoxville Courthouse  
Ain't got a thing to do  
I don't wanna go to the movies  
Couldn't if I wanted to, I'm on trial for lovin' you  
  
Now this all started in a honky tonk  
Just the other side of town  
A girl come in took a stool by me  
Ordered gin and drank it down  
  
She lit up a cigarette and turned around  
Well, she said my name is Jeannie  
And asked me what was mine  
I answered Hank and I walked  
To the jukebox droppin' a dime  
  
I looked at her short dress low neck line  
Well, we danced for five or ten minutes  
And I held her close to me  
  
Kissed her lips and squeezed her hips  
And judged about twenty-three  
Whispered in my ears, I said, "Yes siree"  
  
Now the scene is a little motel  
Out on the state highway  
And there's a room for two  
Love is about to take place  
  
And a state trooper breaks down the door  
Shines a flash light in my face  
I said, "What the hell is this"  
And another man and woman come in  
  
And the girl I'm with starts cryin' and screamin'  
And she runs over to them  
Said, "Thank God you're here  
He tried to hurt me mama"  
  
I said now you don't mean  
The cop says, "Son the girl is seventeen"  
So that's why I'm in Knoxville courthouse  
And the judge passed sentence on me  
  
And it's ten long years for statutory rape  
In the state penitentiary  
Lord, I can't believe this is happened to me  
  
So when next time you give a girl the eye  
She gives you that certain smile  
Just remember under that woman's breast  
May beat the heart of a child  
  
Don't you let yourself be the one  
To help a mixed up kids go wild  
This story happened a lot that's true  
But you better hope and pray it never happens to you

Well you know you get the hots for some gal, you just can't stop  
Makin' love six times a day better than pork chop  
'Cause ones' good as the other and you know what I mean  
Some of them like a little bit of fat  
Some of them like that meat just a little bit lean  
  
I like gravy on the side with hot and juicy lovin'  
Brown sugar on top, sausage warm out of the oven  
Sometimes you get to eatin' Lord and you just can't stop  
Make me wonder to myself  
Why oh why, why did I leave that last pork chop  
  
Well met this fine gal in the choir, she sure could sing  
She said come down to my house  
I'm gonna give you ham hocks and beans  
We devoured each other Lord, her kitchen was smokin' hot  
I had to jump up and open a window and I thought to myself  
Why did I leave that last pork chop  
  
I have been on a very strict diet of beer and scotch and love  
I was offered lunch break specials, but now I'm a fool for her  
She'd been serving that pie while I was gone punchin' the clock  
I thought about that waitress down at Maxine's and I said to myself  
Why did I leave that last pork chop

I went home with the waitress  
The way I always do  
How was I to know  
She was with the  
Russians too?  
  
I was gambling in Havana  
I took a little risk  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
They'll get me out of this, hah!  
  
I'm the innocent bystander  
Somehow I got stuck  
Between the rock  
And a hard place  
And I'm down on my luck  
Yes I'm down on my luck  
Well I'm down on my luck  
  
I'm hiding in Honduras  
I'm a desperate man  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
The shit has hit the fan  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
All right  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Huh!  
Uhh!  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Uhh!  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Hyah!  
Send lawyers, guns and money  
Ooh!  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Yeah!  
Uh!

Now they say Hank Jr. has strayed away  
From all them songs that put his daddy in an early grave  
But his daddy would be proud if he could see Bocephus now  
Why don't you leave that boy alone, let him sing his song?  
  
Oh, Waylon has been known to play half time  
He been known to get out of his mind  
Don't know whether he's right or wrong  
He's got a string of hits about two miles long  
Why don't you leave that boy alone, let him sing his song?  
  
Why don't you leave them boys alone let 'em sing their song  
You know they're gonna do whatever they want.  
If you don't like the way they sing who's gonna cast the first stone?  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song?  
  
Hank Williams was the king of country soul  
My dad took me to see him in Lubbock but he didn't show  
Now the people got mad and they all went home  
The first thing we did was put his records on.  
I guess we should have left him alone and let him sing his songs.  
  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song  
You know they're gonna do whatever they want.  
If you don't like the way they sing who's gonna cast the first stone?  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song?  
  
Why don't you leave them boys alone, let 'em sing their song?

Everyone's here, talking and dancing. There havin' a good time,  
  
But its hard to smile when my friends all know I got you on my mind.  
  
Hey I'm not in the mood to hear another fast dancin' song. I don't care if
it's old country gold or new country soul.  
  
I've had enough of this rock-n-roll.  
  
Let's keep the heart in the country, 'cause that's where it should always be.  
  
Don't get me wrong I like to party, but tonight I must sit this one out you
see,  
  
Because the one I love is leavin', bartender bring me whiskey please,  
  
Let's keep the heart in the country, 'cause love has torn the heart right out
of me.  
  
Now that was great, please thank the band for playing that song.  
  
It was nice and smooth like this Kentucky brew that I am sipping on  
  
Oh how I'll miss her, but I got my music and now I'll get along,  
  
I don't feel bad now you see, misery loves company in a country song.  
  
Let's keep the heart in the country, 'cause that's where it should always be,  
  
Don't get me wrong I like to party but tonight I must sit this one out you
see.  
  
'cause the one I love is leavin', bartender, bring more whiskey please,  
  
And let's keep the heart in the country 'cause love torn the heart right out
of me,  
  
And lets keep the heart in the country, 'cause love has torn the heart right
out of me.

It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
That's why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when I'm liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
She wants to tell me where to go  
Tell me what to do  
Tell me what to eat  
And how loud I can chew  
She even wants to tell me  
What thoughts I oughta think  
It used to drive me crazy  
Till it drove me to drink  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
That's why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when I'm liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
Well shes such a pretty thing  
You'd think shes heaven sent  
She's the quarrelsome kind  
Love's an argument  
She could yell all day  
She can scream all night  
I just sit there smilin  
As high as a kite  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
That's why I drinking all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when I'm liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
This drinking buddy of mine  
Said he met a girl  
Said she was the meanest  
Woman in the world  
I saw her pretty picture  
I said man your poking fun  
Then the day I met her  
I said pour me one  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
That's why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when I'm liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
You may look down your nose at me  
Think I'm an old sorry  
Son of a bean  
The only way I'm giving up  
My drinking glass is if I can  
Find a way to get her off my back  
  
Spoken: Your wife's on the phone.  
  
Little brown jug upon my lips  
Your saving our love  
With every sip  
  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
That's why I drink all the time  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when I'm liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
Every time I get sober  
She drives me out of my mind  
It takes a whole lot of liquor  
To like her  
But when I'm liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
But when I'm liquored up  
I like her just fine  
  
But when I'm liquored up  
Hell I love her

Well I told you once and I told you twice and I ain't gonna tended to you no

I got a feelin' called the blu-ues, oh, lawd  
Since my baby said good-bye  
And I don't know what I'll do-oo-oo  
All I do is sit and sigh-igh, oh, lawd  
That last long day she said good-bye  
Well lawd I thought I would cry  
She'll do me, she'll do you, she's got that kind of lovin'  
Lawd, I love to hear her when she calls me  
Sweet dad-ad-ad-dy, such a beautiful dream  
I hate to think it all o-o-ver  
I've lost my heart it seems  
I've grown so used to you some-how  
Well, I'm nobody's sugar- daddy now  
And I'm lo-on-lonesome  
I got the lovesick blu-ues.  
  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal  
That's what's the matter with me  
Well, I'm in love, I'm in love, with a beautiful gal  
But she don't care about me  
Lawd, I tried and I tried, to keep her satisfied  
But she just wouldn't stay  
So now that she is lea-eav-in'  
This is all I can say.  
  
Repeat 1st verse

Well, I've been sittin' here listenin'  
To your songs all night long  
Oh, you think you've got it all figured out  
You don't know at all  
  
Everything I've heard from you  
It's all a pack of lies  
I wouldn't spend another quarter  
For what you've said tonight  
  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't you got a song  
That tells the truth I didn't do her wrong  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't a word of it so  
You know I didn't leave her  
That woman made me go  
  
Well I think you've already said way too much  
And I've had way too many rounds  
I never fought a jukebox before  
But it's time to hit you down  
  
You've made a whole lotta accusations  
Without one bit of proof  
And if you say I cheated one more time  
I'll pull the plug on you  
  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't you got a song  
That tells the truth I didn't do her wrong  
Lyin' jukebox, ain't a word of it so  
You know I didn't leave her  
That woman made me go  
You know I didn't leave her  
That woman made me go

I took a job in the city  
And I left my country home  
I learned to survive and I got street-wise  
But I couldn't tell for how long  
  
Then I met you where they sing the blues  
Downtown a few months ago  
And you taught me it's still good to believe in love  
And I love you so  
  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, city girl, to get to you  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, darlin', major moves just for you  
  
I sold some things and I bought a ring  
And I've been married before one time  
And this major move just goes to prove  
Like they say love is really blind  
  
Yes, I've made a change  
And there ain't no one to blame  
But me if things don't work out right  
  
And they just might work out  
'Cause all I think about  
Is that city girl and country boy tonight  
  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, city girl, just for you  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, darlin, major moves to get to you  
  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, darlin', just to get with you  
I'm makin' some major moves  
Oh, baby, major moves to get to you  
Major moves all for you

Like mighty oak trees  
They line a shaded well worn path  
They're the souls that hae walked beside me  
And I can see that looking back  
Friends that stood by me  
Right up to the last  
Like mighty oak trees, that help me walk this well worn path.  
Down by the water  
Of a stream that never ends  
They shelter me from the noon day sun and guard me from the wind  
I close my eyes and I can see them all once again  
  
Like mighty oak trees, down by that stream that never ends.  
Strong and always there when I needed them the most  
You know they're rooted way down deep in my soul  
I think about them all the time when I'm out on the road  
And every night when I lay down I know I'm looking up at mighty oak trees  
Like mighty oak trees  
They have stood the test of time  
They were always there to lean on  
When stregth was hard to find  
I just hope that one day you're lucky enough to find  
Mighty oak trees  
Mighty oak trees like those rowdy friends of mine...

If the wife and I are fussin', brother that's our right  
'Cause me and that sweet woman's got a license to fight  
Why don't you mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
'Cause if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.  
  
Oh, the woman on our party line's the nosiest thing  
She picks up her receiver when she knows it's my ring  
Why don't you mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
Well, if you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.  
  
I got a little gal that wears her hair up high,  
The boys all whistle when she walks by.  
Why don't you mind your own buisness  
(Mind your own business)  
Well, if you mind your own business, you sure won't be minding mine.  
  
If I want to honky tonk around 'til two or three  
Now, brother that's my headache, don't you worry 'bout me.  
Just mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
If you mind your business, then you won't be mindin' mine.  
  
Mindin' other people's business seems to be high-toned  
I got all that I can do just to mind my own  
Why don't you mind your own business  
(Mind your own business)  
If you mind your own business, you'll stay busy all the time.

I'm going to Montana to spend the winter  
I hear the snows are deep up there and the winds are cold  
Way out there the blues will never find me  
Oh, I'm going to Montana to rest my soul  
  
I wish that special someone was goin' along  
But she don't love me anymore so I'll be gone  
Maybe I can find someone who cares  
'Bout the man I am stead of clothes I wear  
'Cause I ain't takin' nothin' but my boots and jeans  
And a big ole cold along  
  
But oh Lord, wouldn't her warm skin feel good at night  
Makin' love in a sleepin' bag and holdin' me [pretty] tight  
We've spent the days side by side right upon the great divide  
And look across America and feel so free inside  
  
Oh Lord, that would be quite a change for a country boy like me  
Up there in the snow drifts right up to my knees  
And as I warm my hands by the fire  
I'd have to fight off the great desire  
To call that girl and ask her  
To come out here for a while  
  
I'm going to Montana to spend the winter  
I hear the snows are deep up there and the winds are so cold  
Way out there the blues will never find me  
Oh, I'm going to Montana to rest my soul  
  
I wish that special someone was goin' along  
But she don't love me anymore so I'll be gone  
Maybe I can find someone who cares  
A sweet simple baby who'd like to share  
This love I've held inside me for so long  
And help me sing my Montana song, ooh

She speaks with the voice of an angel she smiles a heavenly smile  
Soft as the warm winds of April and pure as the heart of a child  
But that's just one of the moods of Mary one of her faces that I see  
I know about the moods of Mary 'cause one of her moods is me  
  
Mary will lie and deceive me she can be fickle and cold  
She'll offer her lips just to tease me and then give me heartaches untold  
But that's just one of the moods of Mary part of her personality  
I don't mind the moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me  
  
Mary can change like the seasons she can be tender and kind  
Then she hurts me without any reason and drives me out of my mind  
But I can live with the moods of Mary if that's the way it has to be  
I forget the other moods of Mary, when Mary's in the mood for me

She warned me once she warned me twice but I don't take no one advice  
So scratch it on over (scratch it on over) shake it on over (shake it over)  
Move over short dog cause the tall dog's movin' in  
  
She'll crawl back to me on her knees I'll be busy scratchin' please  
So slide it on over (move it on over) sneak it on over (move it on over)  
Move over good dog's cause a mad dog's movin' in  
Remember up before you whine that side of door ain't this side of mine  
Su shut it on over (shot it on over) sweep it on over (sweep it on over)  
Move over cold dog cause the hot dog's movin' in

(Chorus:)  
Mr. Lincoln I wish you were here  
The Republics changed alot in a hundred years  
I don't think its working like you planned  
Mr Lincoln we sure could use a hand  
  
I just read the headlines in the Nashville News  
And I wish I made this up but I'm afraid its true  
Cause a man was murdered for his money in the street  
He was takin his wife to a nice place to eat  
When they caught the man he did 23 months of time  
He plead insanity like they do now all the time  
Sir what would you have done in 1859  
Now if you shoot someone sir you can get off scott free  
Its the latest thing mr Lincoln can you believe  
Now they sue the manufactures of the guns  
Aint the law changed alot since 1861  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I just heard the new story on the radio  
They let dangerous men outta prison now yes sir I'm afraid its so  
Because theyre overcrowded and it was only his fifth offense  
And this time hes killed someone does that make any sense  
Now my lawyer called me about a nuisance case  
Cause everybody sues over any little thing these days  
Well at least we're right all we gotta do is tell the truth  
  
He said youre living in the past you romantic fool  
I said you got that right I lean toward the older ways  
And theres damn few back woods lawyers left today  
  
(Chorus 2x)

Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
I can't buy no beer  
  
Well I'm standin' on a corner  
With a bucket in my hand  
I'm waitin' for a woman  
That ain't got no man  
  
'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
I can't buy no beer  
  
Well, I went upon the mountain  
I looked down in the sea  
I seen the crabs and the fishes  
Doin' the be-bop-bee  
  
'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
I can't buy no beer  
  
Well, there ain't no use  
Of me workin' so hard  
When I got a woman  
In the boss man's yard  
  
'Cause my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
I can't buy no beer  
  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
Yeah, my bucket's got a hole in it  
I can't buy no beer

You don't care one thing about me and you never will I know  
Still I hang around you darling you know I can't let you go  
I know you will only hurt me just because I love you so  
I know I should be leaving but my heart won't let me go  
  
Tonight when you are sleeping I will lie awake and cry  
For in my heart I know that soon you'll say goodbye  
How I hate to see tomorrow it will just bring tears and woe  
I know I should be leaving but my heart won't let me go

Well you head on out in the jungle  
Lookin' for the girls to tumble  
Up and down and all around the stage  
But when the women start takin' their clothes off  
  
Now we have got some strange laws  
The most hypocritical thing around these days  
'Cause where I live in Tennessee  
Why an auto parts calender hey that's pornography  
But go right down the road, read what the sign says  
  
Naked women and beer we got it all in here  
For your eyes and your ears  
They show it all in the clear  
Way up north and down south  
Whoo, somebody shut my mouth  
  
Now I ain't sayin' it's right  
But I ain't sayin' it's wrong  
But myself I enjoy the site  
Of pretty girls dancin' to their songs  
  
And it's been like that since way back when  
From little Egypt to the Vegas strip  
And when the music starts groovin'  
And the girls start movin'  
Ain't nothing gonna make 'em quit  
  
Naked women and beer, we got it all in here  
For your eyes and your ears  
They show it all in the clear  
Way up north and down south  
Whoo, somebody shut my mouth  
  
Nak-nak-nak-nak-nak-naked women  
Nak-nak-nak-naked women  
Ice cold beer it's all together in here  
Naked women and beer  
  
C'mon in out of the rain  
We got the girls that will make you  
Spend all your change  
Naked women and beer

I'm nobody's child I'm nobody's child I'm like a flower just growing wild  
There's no mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles  
Nobody wants me I'm nobody's child  
I was slowly passin' an orphan's home one day  
  
And stop there for a moment just to watch the children play  
Alone a boy was standin' and when I asked him why  
He turned his eyes that couldn't see and he began to cry  
People come for children and take them for their own  
  
But they all seem to pass me by and leave me all alone  
I know they'd like to take me but when they see that I'm blind  
They always take some other child and I'm left behind  
I'm nobody's child...  
  
No mother's arms to hold me or soothe me when I cry  
Sometimes it gets so lonely here I wish I could die  
I walk the streets of heaven where all the blinds can see  
And just like for the other kids there'd be a home for me  
No mommy's kisses and no daddy's smiles nobody wants me I'm nobody's child

We started the tour out in Denver, Colorado  
I made the first one but I did not make the second show  
'Cause I met this girl there that brought about quite a big change  
But I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name  
  
I guess you could say that my love life would not up to part  
Too many nights alone had left some permanence scars  
She told me she'd love me and I told her I'd do the same  
Then I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name  
  
I brought it on myself and I guess that I shouldn't complain  
Doc said son you can't do anymore of that cocaine  
But she made me higher than all of those expensive things  
But I od'd in Denver and wish I could remember her name  
  
I turned to other things tryin' to make my daydreams real  
But they don't take the place of the woman's face and her feels  
She treated me nice and I like to find her again  
But I od'd in Denver and I just can't remember her name  
I brought it on myself, kinda overdid it in Denver  
And I just can't remember her name

Old flame new fire let the good times roll while the fire burns out of control  
  
Hello honey (how you doin') it's so good to see you

You and me together ah we can make a good thing better  
  
Can't do no wrong honey child from now on  
  
Old flame new fire burnin'...

Well I kicked the habit, of smoking back sometime ago.  
And I tried the hard stuff, but I had to let all that go.  
But the toughest thing I ever gave up was today.  
Cause Old Habits Like You are hard to break.  
  
I chew lifesavers to help me get off ciggarates.  
But you know for your love I aint found no lifesavers yet.  
And I've grown cold Turkey cause theres not even on kiss ad day.  
And Old habits like you are hard to break.  
  
Old habits like you are hard to break.  
Love with someone new is so hard to make.  
I had grown so use to your love and all of your ways.  
  
And Old Habits Like You are hard to breakbla

The old Nashville cowboy was burdened with time  
He was bent by his years and the fight with the wine  
With a head full of music and an old nursery rhyme  
A heart full of sadness and dark sunken nights  
He told me they cheated he told me they stole  
The strength from his youth and the songs from his soul  
He said he was family till he got too old  
And he called them miners mother load finders  
Digging so deep in search of more gold  
Oh where are the cowboys and the home on the range  
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James  
Now the good guys on TV seem bad ain't it strange  
And the old Nashville cowboys missed out on the change  
  
The old cowboy's life now is gone with the past  
Like whiskey he drank it all went out too fast  
He didn't know how to make each swallow last  
And the head waitress won't be back to fill up his glass  
Oh where are the cowboys and the home on the range  
Does anyone know that they've killed Jesse James  
Is anyone listening or is everyone blind  
And old Nashville cowboys will sing for a dime  
And hard times are cheap at the end of the line

I'm an outdoor kinda man and I really love the land  
From the mountains of Montana to the Alabama sand  
I don't care much about tv 'cause there's country yet to see  
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend  
I'm an outdoor kinda man  
  
Give me a cane pole and a shotgun  
And I can have a whole lotta fun  
A soft ole pair of hikin' boots  
A pocket knife and a campfire too  
You go out in the woods alone wonder where the big buck's roam  
What's that noise and your heart beats fast  
Then you smile when a squirrel runs past  
I don't have to get a bear just want to breathe that country air  
I'm goin' out every time I can  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man  
  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man I really love the land  
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Florida Keys sand  
I don't care much about tv 'cause there's country I ain't seen  
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man  
  
I want a mountaintop and a wheat field  
A cool clear lake, a rod and a reel  
A four-wheeler, a ride on a bike  
A horseback trip, a snowshoe hike  
  
The concrete jungle I don't want, I'd rather be out in the swamp  
My job's got me tied up so I dream of where the red fern grow  
This weekend I'll find where the river bends and the fish jump high  
I'll be there every time I can  
I'm an outdoor kinda man  
  
I'm an outdoor lovin' man and I really love the land  
From the rugged Maine coastline to the Alabama sand  
All the talk shows on tv they don't do a whole lot for me  
I'd rather be in a deer stand I'm an outdoor lovin' man  
  
I'd rather be on the lake with a fishin' friend  
I'm an outdoor kinda man

She works in the bank and she works in the store  
And she don't go for that old stuff anymore  
Likes to get high and listen to the band  
She likes to make love to her kind of man  
These outlaw women, first of their kind  
Outlaw women they got here right on time  
Outlaw women don't need any guns  
Outlaw women just out for fun  
  
In many ways she's a lot like me  
She don't give a damn 'bout society  
Might be little rich girl, or she might be poor  
She Might be a married woman that needs a little more  
Shes a outlaw woman, first of her kind  
These outlaw women ridin' high in seventy-nine  
Outlaw women don't need any guns  
These outlaw women were just out for fun  
  
Some call her a lady some call her other names  
But you wont ever call her that around me and my gang

I've always been labeled, As a rip roarin Hell Raisin kind  
But you know here lately, I got other things on my mind  
Like livin and dyin, and where I'll spend eternity  
What kind of reward Jesus, Have you got out on me  
  
Down here on earth, There's a big price on my head  
But I've got all my friends and my loved ones who'll cry when I'm dead  
And someday we'll all sing along, From the other side  
Cause I've heard that everyone's wanted,  
Behind your heavenly gates in the sky  
  
Chorus  
What kind of reward Jesus, Have you got on me  
I wonder how the words on my big, Wanted poster do read  
And oh how I'd love to be taken, into your custody  
What kind of reward Jesus, Have you got on me

I wish you'd look who's crawling back to you I never thought I'd live to see
today  
I swore to you the day I left this time I'd go for good  
And I was even proud enough to tell myself I could  
But it took a lot of lonely nights to ever change my mind  
  
It took a lot of missing youth and things that I'd left behind  
Intending to keep going but the going it got too rough  
And pride's not hard to swallow once you chewed it long enough  
  
I know we won't always see eye to eye  
But if you'll take me back this time I'll really try  
So many things I could have done so much I failed to do  
I've never needed anyone as much as I need you  
And it took a lot of lonely nights...

I can settle dow-own and be doin'just fine  
Til I hear an old train rollin'down the line  
Then I hurry strai-aight home and pack  
And if I didn' go, I believe I' blow my stack  
I love you ba-aby, but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me  
He made a ramblin' man.  
  
Some folks might sa-ay that I' no good  
That I wouldn' settle down if I could  
But when that open ro-oad starts to callin'me  
There' somethin'o'r the hill that I gotta see  
Sometimes it' har-rd but you gotta understand  
When the lord made me, he made a ra-amblin'man.  
  
I love to see the tow-owns a-passin'by  
And to ride these rails 'eath god' blue sky  
Let me travel this la-and from the mountains to the sea  
'Cause that' the life I believe he meant for me  
And when I' go-one and at my grave you stand  
Just say God called home your ra-amblin'man.

There's coming a day when the world shall melt away  
And Jesus shall come to claim his own  
No more tears no pain  
No woe in this wicked world below  
Then will you be ready to go home  
Will you be ready to go ready to go home  
To live with him up there round the throne  
When he says come unto me will your soul be claim and free  
Then will you be ready to go home  
  
In this world of greed and hate will you wait till it's too late  
Too late to claim the Saviour for your own  
For he's coming someday to bear your soul away  
Then will you be ready to go home  
Will you be ready to go...  
Then will you be ready to go home

I've been here longer and I'm stronger  
And I've seen as much as any man  
Now many's crossed me but none have bossed me  
And I don't believe they ever can  
Hello son, I see you're wearin' a gun  
And you say, you're on your way into town  
  
You say, your ma told you not to  
But you feel you got to  
Get that man that gunned your daddy down  
From the Sheriff's office to the gallows boy  
That's a mighty mighty short walk  
So, why you worry your horse son?  
  
Let you and I take it easy and have a little talk  
'Cause I've been here longer  
  
Well, I can see that you're angry  
And I guess, you've got plenty right to be  
But the law can handle your daddy's killer  
Much better than you or me  
And remember your promise you made your mother  
That you never would fought on a gun  
  
So go on home to her boy  
'Cause she needs you  
She wouldn't stand to lose her only son  
Well, I see you thought it over  
And I'm glad to see you going home boy  
And you wanna know what they call me  
  
Well, I'm just the river, they call me the Mississippi  
I've been here longer

I've met a girl or two in my lifetime and I've loved a few but not the right
time  
  
I think I'm a wastin' my time lovin' anyone but you  
  
You got a hold on me I just can't seem to break free  
  
I walk a girl to town and start to fool around but honey you're the rock in my
shoe  
  
I stroll into the night spots thinkin' that I'm something real hot  
  
I got a pretty girl and she's got a lot but I know she ain't true  
  
It's just not the same I'm playin' a fool's game  
  
Oh when I start to dance and try to make romance honey you're the rock in my
shoe  
  
Now my heart has reached that decision cause my mind keeps havin' a vision  
  
No --- hers and his and and I guess I always knew  
  
You'd make the bells ring and pull my heart strings  
  
I'm walkin' down the aisle with the great big smile  
  
Cause there ain't no rocks in my shoe  
  
  
  
There's always a rock in my shoe when I walk with someone new  
  
I try to find love in another's arms but it seems I just dream of you  
  
Now my heart has reached...  
  
I'm walkin' down the aisle...

Rockin' chair money  
  
Now I got rockin' chair money  
But I got it the hard, hard way  
I fought in every battle  
From the start to the vj day  
  
Now I'll rock, yeah, rock  
Oh baby rock, rock on down the line  
  
Now some folks seem to be jealous  
Some don't seem to care  
But I got rockin' chair money, honey  
To rock on away from here  
  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, rock on down the line  
  
I rocked away out on the ocean  
I rocked from here and there  
My baby stepped out while I was gone  
Now she don't get my rockin' chair  
  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, rock on down the line  
  
I'll soon get my big check, baby  
And then we'll have some fun  
This rockin' chair money, honey  
Is better than totin' a gun  
  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, let's rock on down the line  
  
Now honey, let's go honky-tonkin'  
Let's honky-tonk all night  
Let's lolly gag and smooch and love  
And do it all upright  
  
'Cause I love to rock, yeah rock  
Baby rock, let's rock on down the line

Shadow face. A little boy out on the stage.  
Oh his daddy sings and plays 'em another song.  
Shadow face. Now his daddy's gone away,  
And his mother says, son you must carry on.  
Shadow face, you're much too young to take his place.  
You'll be walkin' in his shadow for so long, for so long.  
Shadow face, Oh they say you're of his (grace)?,  
With your hair and beard and singin' strange new songs.  
  
Shadow face, son you and your friends better slow down the pace,  
Or you're gonna burn yourselves out before long.  
Who ever told you, what you could and could not do.  
Oh you get so tired of bein' told you're wrong,  
But some of my friends are gone.  
Better days, hear your songs on the hit parade,  
Now they tell you we were behind you all the way. Yeah.  
Shadow face, boy don't you let it all go to waste,  
You've seen so many fall who thought they had it made.  
Shadow face, you're much happier these days,  
Does a smile really look so out of place,  
Here on shadow face, right here on shadow face.

Loving me to you seems such a bother you made it so easy for me to love
another  
So don't you blame her for stealing me you let her  
Cause where your love stopped she went a little bit farther  
Why you changed so much I was more at ease with a stranger  
And it wasn't so hard our love was already in danger  
Now she does everything that pleases me that you never  
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther  
She went a little bit farther just to make me feel love  
She considered my feelings now she's all that I'm thinking of  
So don't blame her for stealing me you know you let her  
And where your love stopped she went a little bit farther  
  
Yeah where your love stopped she went a little bit farther

There ain't too much chance for opportunity  
In this town that I live in  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do with me  
And it's getting hard to contend  
With the fact that I ain't going nowhere  
If I don't get out of here  
I need a change of luck and a pick-me-up  
Something more than the bars and the beers  
  
I need something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
Cause I got a bad case of the blues  
Something to believe in  
Something to make me feel right  
Something to believe in  
Is that asking too much out of life  
  
Well I quit my job  
And I'm leaving today  
Cause two hundred a week, it don't make it  
I got a ticket going to L.A.  
And I'm hoping I can take it  
Cause I got enough money for about a month before I'll be back on the bus  
But I got faith in me and all new things I see  
I just need a little good luck  
  
Well I was getting down  
Soon I'd have to leave town  
And I was out walking the street  
When I met a girl  
By the burger world  
And I was needing her company  
By the way she was dressed  
I knew what to expect  
When we got to her motel room  
Ah, but when she found out I came from her hometown  
She starting crying and Lord I did too  
  
I need something to believe in  
Ah, baby something to look forward to  
Ah, do you feel like I do  
Something to believe in  
She said please stay with me tonight  
I want something to believe in  
Just talk to me and hold me tight  
  
She was just eighteen  
And I couldn't believe  
What had happen since she left home  
I thought I had some pains  
But it wasn't the same  
As the hell she had known  
So we packed our stuff  
And we got on the bus  
And now it's back to the same old grind  
But if you could have seen  
The way she looked at me  
When she saw the city limit sign  
  
We got something to believe in  
Something to look forward to  
Something to believe in  
And I believe in me and you  
Something to believe in  
Holding each other tight  
Something to believe in  
That special something called being in love to get us by

I know that I'm not great  
And some say I imitate  
Anymore I don't know  
I'm just doing the best I can  
  
After all I'm standing in the shadows  
Of a very famous man  
  
As I travel around from town to town  
I have a lot of dad's fans and friends come around  
They say I know Hank would be proud of you  
If he were here today  
  
Now well, we're all so glad  
And we know he would be too  
That you're carryin' on  
His music this way  
  
Yes, they say Hank was the all time great  
And we know you'll be just as good as your dad  
But I just smile and say there'll never be another Hank Williams friends  
That's the part that always makes them sad  
  
Yes, I know that I'm not great  
And some say, I imitate  
Anymore I don't know  
I'm just doing the best I can  
  
It's hard standing in the shadows  
Of a very famous man  
  
So many times when I'm on that stage  
I feel something go through me  
And for a minute I'm in a different world  
And that's when it does something to me  
  
The people are a hollering and clapping real aloud  
While I'm out they're taking my bows  
I look up toward the ceiling and I say to myself  
"Listen dad, just listen to that crowd"  
  
But as the show goes on the people clap and holler more  
I start to singing another of your great songs  
That's the time that I know although you're gone  
Your music will live on and on and on

All the talk shows, you know, geniouses and experts  
Looking to lay some blame  
Some on the left and some on the right  
Playing that controversy game  
I'm not in a real cheery mood so I think I'll call them up  
And them em, why don't you play some blues  
And both sides shut up  
  
But do we just love trouble  
Ain't the world got enough  
Without y'all stirrin it up  
  
I am from the old school  
Cowboy hat, sure enough  
Too damn old to change horses now  
Cause I would probably fall off  
I'm a little whiskey bent and slowed my roll  
And if you ain't real sure about me  
Why don't you take it up with Gretchen and Tim  
Rockin Shawn Hannity  
  
But you just love trouble  
Ain't the world got enough  
Without y'all stirrin it up  
  
Back off  
  
So some celeb has teed y'all off  
Well, I get teed off too  
Why didn't you know that you're supposed  
To except our point of view  
I have learned at the school of hard knocks  
Things change quite a bit  
Folks get all jacked up  
I don't really give a... Darn  
  
I got a little child and a fishing pole  
A can of worms and a boat  
I'm goin down to the river now  
And let all my problems float  
Yeah, I've mellowed a lot  
And I don't jump into things like I used to  
Hey, what'd you say  
Why, you son of a gun  
Now see what you made me do

Ain't the world got enough  
Without y'all stirrin it up  
  
Stirrin it up  
  
Let the pot simmer (stirrin it up)  
Let the dust settle (stirrin it up)  
Let's try and get along  
And it'll be more better  
(Stirrin it, stirrin it, stirrin it up)  
(Stirrin it up) sick em, Rush  
(Stirrin it up) jump in there, Bill  
Stir it up, Shawn  
(Stirrin it up)  
(Stirrin it up)

Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
You're grow cold and no longer care for me  
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
  
Take these tears from my eyes and let me see  
Just a spark of the love that use to be  
If you love somebody new let me me find a new love too  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
  
Give my heart just a word of sympathy  
Be as fair to my heart as you can be  
Then if you no longer care for the love being there  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free  
You're grow cold and no longer care for me  
All my faith in you is gone but the heartaches linger on  
Take these chains from my heart and set me free

Back about eighteen and twenty-five I left Tennessee very much alive I never
would've made it through the Arkansas mud If I hadn't been riding on the
Tennessee Stud  
  
Had some trouble with my sweetheart's Pa One of her brothers was a bad outlaw
I wrote a letter to my Uncle Spud And I rode away on the Tennessee Stud On a
Tennessee Stud The Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and
his eyes were green He had the nerve and he had the blood There never was a
horse like Tennessee Stud  
  
Drifted on down into no man's land Across the river called the Rio Grande
Raced my horse with the Spaniard's foe Til I got me a skin full of silver and
gold  
  
Me and the gambler, we couldn't agree We got in a fight over Tennessee Pulled
our guns and he fell with a thud And I rode away on a Tennessee Stud  
  
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and his eyes were
green He had the nerve and he had the blood There was never a horse like the
Tennessee Stud  
  
I rode right back across Arkansas I whipped her brother and I whipped her Pa I
found that girl with the golden hair She was riding on a Tennessee Mare  
  
Pretty little baby on the cabin floor Little horse colt playing round the door
I loved the girl with the golden hair And the Tennessee Stud loves the
Tennessee Mare  
  
The Tennessee Stud was long and lean The color of the sun and his eyes were
green He had the nerve and he had the blood There was never a horse like the
Tennessee Stud

A different boss at work  
That might do me well  
'Cause I'm kinda mad at someone  
Who thinks that they can tell me what to say and do  
Everybody's got a butt and a point of view  
  
Well I used to like to go fishin'  
Watch that hook and line  
But I sold my boat and motor  
And everybody wondered why  
  
That ain't good  
No, that ain't good ('cause that ain't me)  
  
My wife went to a lawyer  
I never dreamed she would  
Now my address is rock bottom  
And they know me in this neighborhood  
  
That ain't good  
No no, that ain't good (I need to get out of here)  
  
Watchin' these nuts on TV  
Blowin' themselves to hell  
So they can all get to heaven  
And my kids want me to tell  
Tell 'em why  
Did all those people have to die  
  
No, that ain't good  
'Cause I don't know why  
  
Went to church Sunday morning  
Never thought I could  
Prayed to the man to help me  
Get back to being myself like I should  
  
It done me good  
Yeah it done me good  
You gotta look for the good in this world

I thought I'd like to leave the black side of life for a while  
To live alone and have some fun  
So I told her to take the kids and go back to her ma  
That's how I wanted it to be and I felt satisfied it was over and done  
I wake up every morning make myself a cup of jay  
Down to the factory that's where I spend my pay  
Five o'clock the whistle blows and that leaves the evening free  
That's how I wanted it to be  
Well it didn't take me long to find out just how much I missed her  
So I wrote and told her to take the kids and come on back home  
Cause I was ready to settle down now  
Well you see I just got her letter today  
And it seems she's found someone she can depend on  
That's how I wanted it to be she ain't coming home no more  
I wake up every morning

Cut-off jeans an' cowboy boots,  
Long blonde hair an' dark brown roots.  
Lord, pinch me:  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
  
Electric slidin' on a sawdust floor,  
Long-neck chaser for a,  
Shot of hard core whiskey:  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
  
Blue red "GO" stickers on the window says "Sugar n' spice.  
Baby, crank the bass up, ride it till you see, girl.  
Those pink paradise.  
Oh, ain't that nice.  
  
Down to the river to go for a dip.  
Rollin' them Levis off of her hip.  
Goin' Big Kenny skinny:  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
Splish-splash.  
  
Instrumental Break.  
  
Watermelon lip-gloss, kiss beneath the swamp moss,  
On a moonlit night.  
Bubble gum perfume, well placed tattoo,  
Above her hiney, high.  
(Oh my.)  
  
Belly button danglin', a twenty minute tan.  
You know, I'll go to Jerry Springer if you hit on my man.  
That girl will throw a hissy.  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
  
Cut-off jeans an' cowboy boots,  
Long blonde hair an' dark brown roots.  
Lord, pinch me:  
That's how they do it in Dixie:  
Yeah, yeah now.  
  
Y'all, that's how we do it in Dixie.  
  
Whoo I love them girls man.  
In Dixie.  
That's how they do it in Dixie.  
That's right, class, that's how we do it in Dixie.  
  
Y'all, that's how we do it in Dixie.  
  
Bocephus, it's a pleasure.  
Let's get into the honky-tonk.  
Aw, had some good ridin' friends on this one.

I'm just a singer  
A natural born guitar ringer  
Kind of an old clinger  
To sad old songs  
  
I'm not a walk behinder  
I'm a new note finder  
But my names a reminder  
Of a blues man that's already gone  
  
So I started drinkin  
And took things that messed up my thinkin'  
I was sure sinkin'  
When you came along  
  
I was alone in the hotlight  
Not too much left in sight  
But she changed all that in one night  
When she sang me this song  
  
"Hey baby, I love you  
Hey baby, I need you  
Hey baby, you ain't gotta prove to me your some kind of macho man  
You wasted so much of your life  
Runnin through the dark night  
Let me shine some love light  
Down on a blues man"  
  
I got so sick of speed  
And all the stuff they said I was needin  
If I was to keep pleasin to all of my fans  
I got cuffed on dirt roads  
I got sued for no-shows  
But you came and took all that old load down on this blues man  
  
"Hey baby, I love you too  
Hey baby, I need you  
Hey baby, I do get tired of this travelin band  
I'm thirty years old now  
Nights would be cold now  
If you wouldn't have stuck it out  
With this blues man"  
  
I'm thirty years old now  
Night sure would be cold now  
If you hadn't stuck it out  
With this blues man

I called you all together for in just an hour or two  
There'll be an auction on the square that just might interest you  
It's the first time I've seen most of you since mama passed away  
And that old chair that rocked us all will be auctioned off today  
  
Well I guess you know of course I lost the farm that daddy sweated all his
life to keep  
And even worked sometimes by moonlight when all of us kids were sound to
asleep  
Now I guess we were all just too busy fulfilling each one's worldly dreams  
To even care when they took the old chair along with all the other things  
You know if you could capture all the love that we found in that old chair  
  
Why you could wipe out all the hatred in this old world  
And you'd still have a lotta love to spare  
Now all I ask and it's not too much is just go with me down to the square  
And let's take a look among all the other things at mama's old rocking chair  
And look at all the teeth marks put there when we were small  
Just go with me for one last look at the chair that rocked us all

This is a coalition to ban coalitions I ain't a politician but I've got views  
  
Some folks want to ban cars some want to get rid of Fender guitars  
  
Why don't you do your thing and we do our thing too  
  
Now they want to take my cigarettes and all my good whiskey  
  
And these damn coalitions they're after you and me  
  
They want to get rid of my forty fours and all the are rated films  
  
If they only knew how much we'd all love to get rid of them  
  
And this is a coalition to ban coalitions the views of a musician yeah I've
got some  
  
Some folks want to ban cars some want to get rid of electricguitars  
  
Why can't everybody else leave everybody else alone  
  
Now the latest thing they want to stomp out is violence on tv  
  
And the worst of all is that Oscar winning rabbit Bugs Bunny  
  
Farewell Foghorn Leghorn so long Yosemite Sam  
  
They're missin' with our heroes and we got to stop them now  
  
And this is a coalition to ban coalitions...

One, two, three more, honey don't get mad and walk out the door  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better start loving before it's too late  
Nine, ten, hi come on in  
Let's kiss and make up and start over again  
  
Now we've all said and done things that we didn't mean  
We get a little mad and we make a big scene  
Oh yes I know it's kinda hard to go back  
Be like Perry Mason though and get all the facts  
  
One, two, three four, honey don't get mad and walk out like before  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better make love girl before it's too late  
Nine, ten, can I come in  
Let's kiss and make up and start all over again  
  
Since Adam and Eve men and women have disagreed  
Love me or leave me ah that is the key  
We got to control our temper to win  
Why you son of a... Whoops, count slowly to ten  
  
Sing one, two, three more, honey don't get mad and walk out the door  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better start loving before it's too late  
Nine, ten, hi come on in  
Let's kiss and make up and start over again  
  
One more  
One, two, three more, honey don't get mad and walk out the door  
Five, six, seven, eight, we better start loving before it's too late  
Nine, ten, hi come on in  
We've kissed and made up and are happy again

Kind of Woman I Got  
  
(version from Osborne Brothers " Country Bluegrass" tape)  
  
You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
Well, the very first thing in the morning is " Get Up."  
  
The last thing I hear every night is " Shut Up."  
  
I found out my own cooking don't tast too hot.  
  
You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
Well, when I'm around the house, you're always a fussing.  
  
Nothing pleases you and you start cussing.  
  
I put up with you, and that's a heck of a lot.  
  
You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
If I had any sense at all I'd go crazy,  
  
But that would do you too much good so I'm not.  
  
Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy.  
  
You aint' the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.  
  
(Banjo plays a verse)  
  
If I had any sense at all I'd go crazy,  
  
But that would do you too much good so I'm not.  
  
Your mamma and your daddy both told me you was lazy.  
  
You ain't the kind of woman I wanted, but you're the kind of woman I got.

I know it's over cause I don't keep you satisfied anymore  
  
But before you move along let me sing you the last love song  
  
Tomorrow when I'll wake what will take the place  
  
Of smiles on your face and black hair against white lace  
  
And I wonder if I'll be thinking of our early morning love  
  
All the sweet things that you'd say that's brighten up my darkest day  
  
And tomorrow night what do use the chest to take the place of your breast  
  
Breast against my chest oh how I'll miss your tenderness but there's no use to
cryin'  
  
Cause love's a grown up game a little pleasure then a lot of pain  
  
First we call each other bad names then what we have was never quite the same  
  
I wish I could find eyes that won't cry lips that won't lie and love that
won't die  
  
Hmm hmm hmm hm and a love that won't die

The streets are paved with tourist and the record companies flourish,  
Lord knows every singer wants to be the king.  
  
But some of them couldn't take it and some good one's didn't make it.  
That's the way it goes on The Nashville Scene.  
  
Now there's a wino on the corner,  
He was a well known guitar picker 'til he got burned out by the game.  
  
Now he'll bum you for some whiskey  
And tell you how it was back in '52 when he played for Hank.  
  
And I'm watching the sun go down this evening  
And soon it will wake this town that's made of dreams.  
  
But before it does a new star will be shining  
And that's the way it is on the Nashville scene.  
  
From the outside its a castle,  
From the inside its a prison its easy to live way beyond your means.  
  
And its a long, long way to the top  
And even further when you drop and I've been on both ends of the Nashville
scene.

I got someone at home don't know what's going on  
  
Thinks I love her and her alone and the pressure is on  
  
I've got a new love you see she does new minds to me  
  
We sneak our love you's on the phone and the pressure is on  
  
And it puts pressure on a man if he ever lets his heart call his hand  
  
He ain't no rolling stone but the pressure is on  
  
[ fiddle - organ ]  
  
Feel like your ten thousand feet down under the sea  
  
And it's crushing all your bones and the pressure is on  
  
The trains I ride in my dreams run on the pressure of the steam  
  
Lord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is on  
  
Lord I could pull one a mile long cause the pressure is on  
  
The pressure is on the pressure at home

Well I was thumbin' from Montgomery  
Had my guitar on my back.  
When a stranger stopped beside  
Me in an antique cadillac.  
He was dressed like nineteen fifty,  
Half drunk and hollow eyed.  
He said it's a long walk to Nashville, son would you like a ride?  
  
I sat down in the front seat, he turned on the radio.  
And them sad old songs coming out of them speakers,  
Was solid country gold.  
  
Then I noticed the stranger was ghost white pale,  
When he asked me for a light.  
And I knew there was something strange about this ride.  
  
Chorus:  
  
He said "Drifter can you make folks cry when you play and sing,  
Have you paid your dues, can you moan the blues,  
Can you bend them guitar strings?  
He said "Boy can you make folks feel what you feel inside,  
'cause if you'rr big star bound let me warn ya it's a long hard ride. "  
  
Then he cried just south of Nashville,  
And he turned that car around.  
He said "This is where you get off boy,  
Because I'm going back to Alabam.  
As I stepped out of that cadillac,  
I said mister many thanks,  
He said "you don't have to call me mister, mister,  
The whole world called me hank.  
  
Chorus 2x  
  
If you're big star bound let me warn ya,  
It's a long hard ride.

Hey there lonely girl can I sit with you  
I've just got to find someone to tell my story to  
You've heard it all before now here it is once more  
And please kiss away my tears when I am through  
It's just the same old story once again with a sweet beginning and a bitter
end  
A love affair that didn't turn out right  
And the world has one more broken heart tonight  
Would you like to dance oh you know it's been a long time  
Since I had a woman satisfy my urge  
But you know it never works a false love won't take away hurt  
But just pretend I'm him and I'll pretend you're her  
And it'll be just the same old story  
  
And the world had one more broken heart tonight
