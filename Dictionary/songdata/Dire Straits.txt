These mist covered mountains  
Are a home now for me  
But my home is the lowlands  
And always will be  
Someday you'll return to  
Your valleys and your farms  
And you'll no longer burn  
To be brothers in arms  
  
Through these fields of destruction  
Baptisms of fire  
I've witnessed your suffering  
As the battle raged higher  
And though they did hurt me so bad  
In the fear and alarm  
You did not desert me  
My brothers in arms  
  
There's so many different worlds  
So many different suns  
And we have just one world  
But we live in different ones  
  
Now the sun's gone to hell and  
The moon's riding high  
Let me bid you farewell  
Every man has to die  
But it's written in the starlight  
And every line in your palm  
We are fools to make war  
On our brothers in arms

[Chorus:]  
Calling Elvis, is anybody home  
Calling Elvis, I'm here all alone  
Did he leave the building  
Or can he come to the phone  
Calling Elvis, I'm here all alone  
  
Well tell him I was calling just to wish him well  
Let me leave my number, heartbreak hotel  
Oh love me tender, baby don't be cruel  
Return to sender, treat me like a fool  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why don't you go get him, I'm his biggest fan  
You gotta tell him, he's still the man  
Long distance baby, so far from home  
Don't you think maybe you could put him on  
  
Well tell him I was calling just to wish him well  
Let me leave my number, heartbreak hotel  
Oh love me tender, baby don't be cruel  
Return to sender, treat me like a fool  
  
[Chorus]

They want to get a statement for jesus' sake  
It's like a talking to the wall  
He's incommunicado no comment to make  
He's saying nothing at all  
  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say  
Say what he means  
Maybe on Monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique  
  
Maybe he could talk about the tricks of the trade  
Maybe he could talk about himself  
Maybe he could talk about the money that he made  
Maybe he'd be saying something else  
  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say,  
Say what he means  
Maybe on monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique  
  
And now the rumors are flying  
Speculation rising  
Say that he's been trying someone else's wife  
Somebody at the airport  
Somebody on the phone  
Says he's at the station and he's coming on the noon  
Then we get the story a serious breeze  
And a photograph taken in the hall  
You don't have to worry with the previous release  
Right now, he's saying nothing at all  
But in the communique you know he's gonna come clean  
Think what he say  
Say what he means  
Maybe on Monday he got something to say  
  
Communication  
Communique  
Communique

Sweet surrender on the quayside  
You remember we used to run and hide  
In the shadow of the cargoes I take you one time  
And we're counting all the numbers down to the waterline  
  
Near misses on the dog leap stairways  
French kisses in the darkened doorways  
A foghorn blowing out wild and cold  
A policeman shines a light upon my shoulder  
  
Up comes a coaster fast and silent in the night  
Over my shoulder all you can see are the pilot lights  
No money in our jackets and our jeans are torn  
Your hands are cold but your lips are warm  
  
She can see him on the jetty where they used to go  
She can feel him in the places where the sailors go  
When she's walking by the river and the railway line  
She can still hear him whisper  
Let's go down to the waterline

It was New Cross Station, I was going on home  
Saw you get your ticket, standing on your own  
Here come the train about 02:44  
I couldn't get a smoker, you took another car  
  
Yeah, the end of the line, we both had to change,  
And you're standing right behind me,  
I'm a feeling kinda strange  
We got to Mile End Road, my heart skipped a beat,  
Standing right behind me, I'm a shakin' in my seat  
3-4 minutes and the train comes through,  
I'm ridin' on the Central, I'm a-lookin' at you.  
  
Woman on the eastbound train,  
Sometimes I wanna see you again.  
  
Now I couldn't read a paper, you couldn't read a book,  
Kept on taking me another look,  
You got off the train, you never looked behind  
I tried, but I can't get you out of my mind.  
  
Woman on the eastbound train,  
Sometimes I wanna see you again.  
  
Well I got one more thing I wanna say before I go  
If you get the message on the radio  
You can write a letter, get in touch with me,  
Leave your number with the company, yeah.  
  
Woman on the eastbound train,  
Sometimes I wanna see you again.

I wonder where your are tonight  
You're probably out on the rampage somewhere  
You have been known to take delight  
In getting in somebody's hair  
And you always had the knack  
Fade to black  
  
I bet you already made a pass  
I see a darkened room somewhere  
You run your fingers around the rim of his glasses  
You run your fingers through his hair  
They scratch across his back  
  
Well maybe its all 4 the best  
But I wish id never been lassoed  
Maybe it some kind of test  
But I wish id never been tattooed  
Or been to hell and back  
Fade to black

Oh well the sun go down  
Celebration in the town tonight  
All day long  
They been slaughtering upon the stone  
Share out the meat  
Yeah, you really like to eat  
Come on woman, come follow me home  
  
Well, the priest he cries  
Virgin ascending to the skies tonight  
All day long  
I have passed my time alone  
And when the church bell rung  
I stayed out on the tower  
In a dying sun  
Now come on woman, come follow me home  
  
Well I don't need no priest  
But I love all of the people  
Yes I share the feast  
So I drink up my wine  
Yes and the song in my bones  
I know the way  
I can see by the moonlight  
Clear as the day  
Now come on woman, come follow me home

The sky is crying the streets are full of tears  
Rain come down wash away my fears  
And all this writing on the wall  
Oh I can read between the lines  
Rain come down forgive this dirty town  
Rain come down and give this dirty town  
A drink of water a drink of wine  
  
If I've been hard on you I never chose to be  
I never wanted no one else  
I tried my best to be somebody you'd be close to  
Hand in hand like lovers are supposed to  
  
As you'd sleep I'd think my heart would break in two  
I'd kiss your cheek I'd stop myself from waking you  
But in the dark you'd speek my name  
You'd say baby what's wrong  
Oh, here I am baby I'm coming back for more  
I'm like a wave that's going to roll into the shore  
Yes and if my love's in vain how come my love is so strong?  
  
Now you and me go parallel together and apart  
And you keep your perfect distance and it's tearing at my heart  
Did you never feel the distance?  
You never tried to cross no line  
Now it's another dirty river and another dirty scar  
And I don't know who's kissing you and I don't know where you are  
So far from home don't you think of me sometimes

Last time I was sober, man I felt bad  
Worst hangover that I ever had  
It took six hamburgers and scotch all night  
Nicotine for breakfast just to put me right  
'cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel  
  
My life makes perfect sense  
Lust and food and violence  
Sex and money are my major kicks  
Get me in a fight I like dirty tricks  
'cause if you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel  
  
My chick loves a man who's strong  
The things she'll do to turn me on  
I love the babes, don't get me wrong  
Hey, that's why I wrote this song  
  
I don't care if my liver is hanging by a thread  
Don't care if my doctor says I ought to be dead  
When my ugly big car won't climb this hill  
I'll write a suicide note on a hundred dollar bill  
'cause if you want to run cool  
If you want to run cool  
Yes if you want to run cool, you got to run  
On heavy, heavy fuel

How long, how long baby  
How long has it been  
How long you gonna keep me wondering  
How long before you see  
Stallin' me was wrong  
How long  
  
How long, how long you gonna keep  
Slappin' my hand away  
How long you gonna keep my love at bay  
How long before you're sure  
My love is strong  
How long  
  
How long, how long you gonna keep  
Tellin' me you like me fine  
How long until I'm gonna make you mine  
How long before wake up  
And find your good man gone  
How long

Oo-ooo if I had you, yeah the things that I could do  
Honey, if I had you  
  
Now I could sing like an angel, fly just like a bird  
Sing you the best love song you ever heard.  
I could be a poet like Mohammed Ali,  
Float like a butterfly, sting just like a, just like a bee.  
  
Mmm, ooo, if I had you, ahhh the things that I could do  
If I had you.  
  
Now I'd go get your name tattooed on my chest,  
Well it'd just say 'my baby, my baby, she's the best.'  
I could be your Superman, you could be my Lois Lane  
I could be a Tarzan, you could be my sweet Jane - if you wanted to.  
  
Mmm if I had you, ah the things that I could do  
If I had you.  
  
Yeah one more time...  
  
Ooo if I had, only had you, Yeah the things that I could do,  
  
Oh boy  
Only if I had you.  
  
So come on dance with me baby, don't let me go.  
Yeah dance with me baby, don't let me go.  
Baby don't let me, don't let me  
Don't let me go, oh no...

Harry made a bareback rider proud and free upon a horse  
And a fine coal miner for the NCB that was  
A fallen angel and Jesus on the cross  
A skating ballerina you should have seen her do the skater's waltz  
Some people have got to paint and draw  
Harry had to work in clay and stone  
Like the waves coming to the shore  
It was in his blood and in his bones  
  
Ignored by all the trendy boys in London and in Leeds  
He might as well have been making toys or strings of beads  
He could not be in the gallery  
And then you get an artist says he doesn't want to paint at all  
He takes an empty canvas and sticks it on the wall  
The birds of a feather all the phonies and all of the fakes  
  
While the dealers they get together  
And they decide who gets the breaks  
And who's going to be in the gallery  
No lies he wouldn't compromise  
No junk no bits of string  
  
And all the lies we subsidize  
That just don't mean a thing  
I've got to say he passed away in obscurity  
And now all the vultures are coming down from the tree  
So he's going to be in the gallery.

I hear the seven deadly sins  
And the terrible twins came to call on you  
The bigger they are babe  
The harder they fall on you  
And you you're always the same you persevere  
On the same old pleasure ground  
Oh and it never rains around here  
It just comes pouring down  
  
You had no more volunteers  
So you got profiteers for to help you out  
With friends like that babe  
Good friends you had to do without  
And now they've taken the chains and the gears  
From off your merry-go-round  
Oh and it never rains around here  
It just comes pouring down  
  
And your new romeo  
Was just a gigolo when he let you down  
See the faster they are babe  
The faster they get out of town  
Leaving make up stains and the tears  
Of a clown  
Yes and it never rains around here  
It just comes pouring down  
  
Oh you were just a roller coaster memory  
I don't know why I was even passing through  
I saw you making a date with destiny  
When he came around here asking after you  
In the shadow of the wheel of fortune  
You're busy trying to clear your name  
You say 'i may be guilty yeah that may be true  
But I'd be lying if I said I was to blame  
See we could have been major contenders  
We never got no money no breaks'  
You've got a list of all the major offenders  
You got a list of all their major mistakes  
And he's just standing on the shadows  
Yes and you smile that come-on smile  
Oh I can still hear you say as clear as the day  
'I'd like to make it worth your while'  
  
Ah but it's a sad reminder  
When your organ grinder has to come to you for the rent  
And all you've got to give him  
Is the use of your side-show tent  
Yes and that's all that remains of the years  
Spent doing to rounds  
And it never rains around here  
Well it just comes pouring down  
  
Now you know what they say about beggars  
You can't complain about the rules  
You know what they say about beggars  
You know who's the first to blame his tools  
You never gave a damn about who you pick up  
And leave lying bleeding on the ground  
You screw people over on the way up  
Because you thought that you were never coming down  
And he takes you out in vaudeville valley  
With his hand up smothering your screams  
And he screws you down in tin pan alley  
In the city of a billion dreams

I tell you what!  
  
They don't mess with me, I'm a wild man, son  
I got me my very own anti tank gun  
I got a jack rabbit with it, guess he was a mean one  
Yeah, I've always been a sportsman  
  
Now, there wasn't much left when I got to him  
Them big old shells didn't just go through him  
Just lumps of fur and that was it  
Guess you could say he sure took a hit, alright  
  
Yeah, you want to see my fire power, see my collection  
Cause that's my thing, man, perfection  
Now I'm talking power in the barrel of a gun  
I'll blow anything I want to kingdom come  
  
Ba ba boom  
Ba ba ba ba bomb  
And I'll blow anything I want  
To kingdom come  
  
Yeah, all you got to do is squeeze on the trigger  
And a little bitty human get a whole lot bigger  
Cause there's a time for talking and a time to shoot them down  
  
And this mama-jama don't pussy foot around, alright  
  
Yeah, let them laugh, let them say we're strange  
Me and my buddies on the rifle range  
But you won't be laughing when it hits the fan  
You're going to want to be a survivor, man  
  
Yeah, you got to see my fire power, see my collection  
Cause that's my thing, man, perfection  
Now, I'm talking power in the barrel of a gun  
I'll blow anything I want to kingdom come  
  
Ba ba boom  
Ba ba ba ba bomb  
And I'll blow anything I want  
To kingdom come  
  
Ba ba ba ba boom  
I say we ought to drop the bomb  
Yes, and I'll blow anything I want  
To kingdom come

Lady Writer on the TV  
Talk about the Virgin Mary  
Reminded me of you  
Expectations left to come up to yeah  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
Yeah, she had another quality  
The way you used to look  
And I know you never read a book  
  
[Chorus:]  
Just the way that her hair fell down around her face  
Then I recall my fall from grace  
Another time, another place  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
She had all the brains and the beauty  
The picture does not fit  
You talked to me when you felt like it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yes and your rich old man  
You know he'd call her a dead ringer  
You got the same command  
Plus you mother was a jazz singer  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
She knew all about a history  
You couldn't hardly write your name  
I think I want you just the same as the  
  
Lady writer on the TV  
Talking about the Virgin Mary  
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me  
And the lady writer on the TV  
Lady writer on the TV  
Talking about the Virgin Mary  
Yeah you know I'm talking about you and me  
And the lady writer on the TV

You walk out on the high wire  
You're a dancer on thin ice  
You pay no heed to the danger  
And less to advice  
Your footsteps are forbidden  
But with a knowledge of your sin  
You throw your love to all the strangers  
And caution to the wind  
  
And you go dancing through doorways  
Just to see what you will find  
Leaving nothing to interfere  
With the crazy balance of your mind  
And when you finally reappear  
At the place where you came in  
You've thrown your love to all the strangers  
And caution to the wind  
  
It takes love over gold  
And mind over matter  
To do what you do that you must  
When the things that you hold  
Can fall and be shattered  
Or run through your fingers like dust

I woke up this morning, my Jacuzzi wouldn't work  
Then the butler quit on me, man, can you believe it? Jerk!  
Must've been my artistic temperament he couldn't take  
How come nobody wants to give me a break?  
  
I got the blues right there, mean and low  
I'm as low as the heels of my alligator shoes  
You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues  
Millionaire blues  
  
Well, I found one of my bathrooms and I made it to the sink  
I called one of my managers up and I poured myself a drink  
Oh, I swear I'd kill that little weasel if I could  
Checked myself in the mirror, my hair was looking good, but  
  
I had the blues right there, mean and mean and mean and low  
As low as the heels on my alligator shoes  
You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues  
Millionaire blues  
Get down!  
  
Well, so much for breakfast, I couldn't face lunch  
I thought I'd raise my spirits with a little champagne brunch  
I take the Lamborghini, the flunky parks the car  
Can you believe it, man, this other monkey won't let me in the bar!  
  
I said, I said, 'Don't you know who I am, man?'  
And he says, 'No', no! Can you believe it?  
I'm as low as the heels of these alligator shoes  
You should know how it feels to have these millionaire blues  
Millionaire blues, to have these millionaire blues, millionaire blues  
  
Bad, bad!  
That's bad! Yeah  
So hard  
It's hard sometimes for a boy  
  
Ah, I like that  
That's good  
Get down!

Here's the party cart  
Ain't that great ?  
That ain't the best part baby  
Just wait

Check out the shingles

Excuse me while I mingle  
Hi, how are you  
Hey everybody

This one's for me  
The host with the most  
  
It's getting a trifle colder  
Step inside my home  
That's a brass toilet tissue holder with it's own telephone  
That's musical doorbell  
It don't ring, I ain't kiddin'  
It plays America the beautiful and tie a yellow ribbon  
  
Boy, this punch is a trip  
It's o.k. in my book  
Here, take a sip  
Maybe little heaven on the fruit  
Ah, here comes the dip  
You may kiss the cook  
Let me show you honey

You take a fork and spire 'em  
Say, did you try these ?  
So glad you like 'em  
The secret's in the cheese

We aim to please  
At my parties  
  
Now don't talk to me about the polar bear  
Don't talk to me about ozone layer

They're running out of rhinos

Let's hear it for the dolphin  
Let's hear it for the trees  
Ain't runnin' out of nothin' in my deep freeze  
It's casual entertaining  
We aim to please

He says it's a shame  
You know it may be a game  
Ah, but I won't play to lose  
  
He's burning the grass  
He take up a glass  
He swallow it neat  
He crosses the floor  
He open the door  
He take a sniff of the street  
  
And she tell him that he's crazy  
She's a-saying listen baby

She tell him that he's crazy  
For gambling a-with his life  
  
But he climbs on his horse  
You know he feel no remorse

Until he's ready to dive  
  
And she tell him that he's crazy  
Yes she's saying listen baby

Some people get a cheap laugh breaking up the speed limit  
Scaring the pedestrians for a minute  
Crossing up progress driving on the grass  
Leaving just enough room to pass  
Sunday driver never took a test  
Oh yeah, once upon a time in the west  
  
Yes it's no use saying that you don't know nothing  
It's still gonna get you if you don't do something  
Sitting on a fence that's a dangerous course  
Oh, you could even catch a bullet from the peace-keeping force  
Even the hero gets a bullet in the chest  
Oh yeah, once upon a time in the west  
  
Mother mary your children are slaughtered  
Some of you mothers ought to lock up your daughters

Can't find no sleeves for my records  
Can't get no laces for my shoes  
Can't get no fancy notes  
On my blue guitar  
  
Can't get no antidote for blues  
Can't find the reasons for your actions  
Or I don't much like the reasoning you use  
Somehow your motives are impure  
Or somehow I can't find the cure  
Can't find no antidote for blues  
  
They say it's mostly vanity  
That writes the plays we act  
They tell me that's what everybody knows  
There's no such thing as sanity  
And that's the sanest fact  
  
That's the way the story goes  
Can't get no remedy on my TV  
There's nothing but the same old news  
They can't find a way to be  
One world in harmony  
Can't get no antidote for blues

Standin' on the corner  
Of Toulouse and Dauphine  
Waitin' on Marie-Ondine  
I'm tryin' to place a tune  
Under a Louisiana moonbeam  
On the planet of New Orleans  
  
In a bar they call The Saturn  
And in her eyes of green  
And somethin' that she said in a dream  
Inside of my suit I got my mojo root  
And a true love figurine  
For the planet of New Orleans  
  
New Orleans - the other planet  
With other life upon it  
And everythin' that's shakin' in between  
If you should ever land upon it  
You better know what's on it  
The planet of New Orleans  
  
Now I'm tryin' to find my way  
Through the rain and the steam  
I'm lookin' straight ahead through the screen  
And then I heard her say  
Somethin' in the Limousine  
'Bout takin' a ride across the planet of New Orleans  
  
If she was an ace  
And I was just a jack  
And the cards were never seen  
We could have been the king and queen  
But she took me back to her courtyard  
Where magnolia perfume screams  
Behind the gates and the granite  
Of the planet of New Orleans

Belladonna's on the high street  
Her breasts up on the offbeat  
And the stalls are just the side shows  
Victoriana's old clothes  
Yeah she got the skirt so tight now  
She want to travel light now  
She want to tear up all her roots now  
She got the turn up on the boots now  
She thinks she's tough  
She ain't no English rose  
But the blind singer  
He's seen enough and he knows  
He do a song about a long-gone Irish girl  
But I got one of for you my Portobello Belle  
  
She sees a man upon his back there  
Escaping from a sack there  
And Belladonna lingers  
Her gloves they got no fingers  
Blind man he's singing the Irish  
He get his money in a tin dish  
Just a corner serenader  
Once upon a time he could have made her  
She thinks she's tough  
She ain't no English rose  
But the blind singer  
He's seen enough and he knows  
He do a song about a long-gone Irish girl  
But I got one of for you my Portobello Belle  
  
Yes and these barrow boys are hawking  
And a parakeet is squawking  
Upon a truck paper rhino  
She get the crying of a wino  
And then she get the reggae rumble  
Belladonna's in the jungle  
But she ain't no garden flower  
There ain't no distress in the tower  
Belladonna walks  
Belladonna taking control  
She don't care about your window box  
Or your button hole  
She sing a song about a long-gone Irish girl  
But I got one of for you my Portobello Belle

It's a mystery to me, the game commences  
For the usual fee, plus expenses  
Confidential information, it's a diary  
This is my investigation, it's not a public inquiry  
  
I go checking out the reports, digging up the dirt  
You get to meet all sorts in this line of work  
Treachery and treason, there's always an excuse for it  
And when I find the reason I still can't get used to it  
  
And what have you got at the end of the day?  
What have you got to take away?  
A bottle of whiskey and a new set of lies  
Blinds on the window and a pain behind the eyes  
Scarred for life, no compensation  
Private investigations

A lovestruck Romeo sings a street suss serenade  
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made  
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade  
Says something like you and me babe how about it?  
  
Juliet says hey it's Romeo you nearly gave me a heart attack  
He's underneath the window she's singing hey now my boyfriend's back  
You shouldn't come around here singing up at people like that  
Anyway what you gonna do about it?  
  
Juliet the dice were loaded from the start  
And I bet and you exploded in my heart  
And I forget I forget the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong, Juliet?  
  
Come up on different streets they both were streets of shame  
Both dirty both mean yes and the dream was just the same  
And I dreamed your dream for you and now your dream is real  
How can you look at me as if I was just another one of your deals?  
  
Well you can fall for chains of silver you can fall for chains of gold  
You can fall for pretty strangers and the promises they hold  
You promised me everything you promised me thick and thin, yeah  
Now you just say oh Romeo yeah you know I used to have a scene with him  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?  
  
I can't do the talk like they talk on TV  
And I can't do a love song like the way it's meant to be  
I can't do everything but I'd do anything for you  
I can't do anything except be in love with you  
  
And all I do is miss you and the way we used to be  
All I do is keep the beat and bad company  
All I do is kiss you through the bars of a rhyme  
Juliet I'd do the stars with you any time  
  
Juliet when we made love you used to cry  
You said I love you like the stars above I'll love you till I die  
There's a place for us you know the movie song  
When you gonna realize it was just that the time was wrong Juliet?  
  
A lovestruck Romeo sings a street suss serenade  
Laying everybody low with a love song that he made  
Finds a convenient streetlight steps out of the shade  
Says something like you and me babe how about it?

You say I'm the greatest bound for glory  
Well the word is out and I learned  
I got the latest side of the story  
You're pulling out before you get burned  
Well your hands are squeezing me down to the bone  
I never saw you breaking no law  
Stands to reason I've got to leave you alone  
What you take me for  
You're setting me up to put me down  
You're making me out to be your clown  
You're just setting me up to put me down  
You better give it up  
Quit your messing around  
You think I care about your reaction  
You think I don't understand  
All you wanted was a piece of the action  
Now you talk about another man.

Two in the morning, dry-dock town  
The river rolls in the night  
Little gypsy moth, she's all tied down  
She quivers in the wind and the light  
  
Yeah, and a sailing ship is just held down in chains  
From the lazy days of sail  
She's just a-lying there in silent pain  
He lean on the tourist rail  
  
A mother and her baby and the college of war  
In the concrete graves  
You never want to fight against the river law  
Nobody rules the waves  
Yeah, and on a night when the lazy wind is a-wailing  
Around the Cutty Sark  
The single-handed sailor goes sailing  
Sailing away in the dark  
  
He's upon the bridge on the self same night  
The mariner of dry-dock land  
Two in the morning, but there's one green light  
And a man on a barge of sand  
  
She's gonna slip away below him  
Away from the things he's done  
But he just shouts "Hey man, what you call this thing?"  
He could have said "Pride of London"  
On a night when the lazy wind is a-wailing  
Around the Cutty Sark  
Yeah, the single-handed sailor goes sailing  
Sailing away in the dark

Your six blade knife can do anything for you  
Anything you want it to  
One blade for breaking my heart  
One blade for tearing me apart  
Your six blade knife-do anything for you  
You can take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin  
When you come up from behind and lay it down cold on my skin  
Took a stone from my soul when I was lame  
Just so you could make me tame  
  
You take away my mind like you take away the top of a tin  
I'd like to be free of it now, I don't want it no more  
I'd like to be free of it now, you know I don't want it no more  
Everybody got a knife it can be just what they want it to be  
A needle a wife or something that you just can't see  
You know it keeps you strong  
Yes and it'll do me wrong  
Your six blade knife, do anything for you.

Here I am again in this mean old town  
And you're so far away from me  
And where are you when the sun goes down  
You're so far away from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
So far away from me  
So far I just can't see  
So far away from me  
You're so far away from me  
  
I'm tired of being in love and being all alone  
When you're so far away from me  
I'm tired of making out on the telephone  
And you're so far away from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
So far away from me  
So far I just can't see  
So far away from me  
You're so far away from me  
  
And I get so tired when I have to explain  
When you're so far away from me  
See you've been in the sun and I've been in the rain  
And you're so far away from me  
  
[Chorus:]  
So far away from me  
So far I just can't see  
So far away from me  
You're so far away from me

Well take a look at that  
I made a castle in the sand  
Saying this is where it's at you know  
Couldn't understand now  
If I realised that the chances were slim  
How come I'm so surprised when the tide rolled in  
  
I want to live on solid rock  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I don't want to be blocked  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
Well I'm sick of potential  
  
I'm sick of vanity now  
I'm sticking to essential reality now  
I don't know what's worse  
Try to make a silk purse  
Living an illusion living in confusion  
Well a house of cards  
Was never built for shock  
  
You could blow it down in any kind of weather  
Now two solid rocks two solid blocks  
You know they're gonna stick  
Yeah they're gonna stick together  
Because the heart that you break  
That's the one that you rely on  
The bed that you make  
That's the one you gotta lie on  
  
When you point your finger 'cause your plan fell through  
You got three more fingers pointing back at you  
I want to live on solid rock  
I'm gonna live on solid rock  
I want to give I don't want to be blocked  
I'm gonna live on solid rock

Southbound again I don't know if I'm going or leaving home  
Boy got to be moving  
Seems like the boy is bound to roam  
Southbound again got no money I've got no place to go  
That woman's with her lover boy  
Never want to see her face no more  
Every single time I roll across the rolling River Tyne  
I get the same old feeling  
Every time I'm moving down the line  
Southbound again last night I felt like crying  
Right now I'm sick of living  
But I'm going to keep on trying.

[dmx]  
Uh-huh, uh-huh (x4)  
  
[Hook:]  
Y'all been eatin long enough now stop bein greedy  
Just keep it real partner give to the needy  
Grips is touchy, so don't make me wait  
Fuck around and I'm go'a bite you and snatch the plate  
  
[dmx]  
I could flip that flow, I could stick that hoe  
I could get that dough, you know I'm with that yo  
And the thing about the shit I came through, I haven't seen  
But when it gets dark, it's like a nigga's havin dreams  
All nightmares, the light dares to desert me  
Got me like everybody wants to hurt me  
Paranoid, so I strike out at what ever  
The closest thing to me is gonna get it  
But, never will I, can I think death is wrong  
So i'ma keep holdin on til, what's left is gone  
You could put that on my nigga boone  
These other rap cats will give a nigga room  
But if it ccalls for me to force my way in the door  
Headhuntin mother fuckers, stay on the floor  
4-4, that's what I get sick wit rrrrrrr  
Four more, now all this is liquid rrrrrr  
  
[hook x2]  
  
[dmx]  
I thank the lord everyday that I'm blessed with a gift  
I'm the best, so, unless you wanna rest with the stiff  
Don't touch that, uh-uh, leave it alone  
When you walk pass the dog house leave it a bone  
Dogs bite, dogs fight, dogs knife  
Scratch, shake, and hold all night  
So when you hear the arf arf, start runnin  
Cause when you hear the arf arf, I'm comin  
But I don't like drama so I say to myself,  
"keep focus with this rap shit and pray for the wealth  
I want the money and give me the honeys with big asses  
The most expensive champagne you got in big glasses"  
I'm broke so i'ma bash his head wide open  
Beggin me to stop but at least he died hopin  
Didn't get his wish, and now he's a dish with a cat  
Two glowin red eyes, everything else is black  
  
[hook x2]  
  
[dmx]  
When the sun is up the gun is up on the shelf  
And all the runners up are thankin me for their help  
Hopin that they not around when it gets dark outside  
Sun's goin down you hear the bark outside  
Locks off the cage, gauge, with the buck shots, faggot  
You've been lucky all day that's when your luck stops  
One drops, and another and another  
Gun pops, go into you and your mother  
When does it all end, I found a friend in a dog  
Cause fuckin wit these cats will send a friend to the morgue  
Many questions, no answers, just stress  
Try to hold my head and remember that I'm blessed  
If you curse and it gets worse as time goes by  
Can't see straight cause I'm so high, why ask why when you know  
Nigga when it's your time to go, you go  
  
[hook x4]

You get a shiver in the dark,  
It's a raining in the park but meantime-  
South of the river you stop and you hold everything  
A band is blowing Dixie, double four time  
You feel alright when you hear the music ring  
  
Well now you step inside but you don't see too many faces  
Coming in out of the rain they hear the jazz go down  
Competition in other places  
Uh but the horns they blowin' that sound  
Way on downsouth  
Way on downsouth  
London town  
  
Check out guitar george, he knows-all the chords  
Mind he's strictly rhythm he doesn't want to make them cry or sing  
They said an old guitar is all, he can afford  
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing  
  
And Harry doesn't mind, if he doesn't, make the scene  
He's got a daytime job, he's doing alright  
He can play the honky tonk like anything  
Savin' it up, for Friday night  
With the Sultans  
We're the Sultans of Swing  
  
Then a crowd a young boys they're a foolin' around in the corner  
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies and their platform soles  
They don't give a damn about any trumpet playin' band  
It ain't what they call rock and roll  
Then the Sultans  
Yeah the Sultans they play creole, creole  
  
And then the man he steps right up to the microphone  
And says at last just as the time bell rings  
Goodnight, now it's time to go home  
And he makes it fast with one more thing  
We are the Sultans  
We are the Sultans of Swing

A long time ago came a man on a track  
Walking thirty miles with a sack on his back  
And he put down his load where he thought it was the best  
He made a home in the wilderness  
He built a cabin and a winter store  
And he plowed up the ground by the cold lake shore  
And the other travelers came walking down the track  
And they never went further, and they never went back  
Then came the churches, then came the schools  
Then came the lawyers, and then came the rules  
Then came the trains and the trucks with their loads  
And the dirty old track was the telegraph road  
  
Then came the mines, then came the ore  
Then there was the hard times, then there was a war  
Telegraph sang a song about the world outside  
Telegraph road got so deep and so wide  
Like a rolling river  
  
And my radio says tonight it's gonna freeze  
People driving home from the factories  
There's six lanes of traffic  
Three lanes moving slow  
  
I used to like to go to work, but they shut it down  
I've got a right to go to work, but there's no work here to be found  
Yes, and they say we're gonna have to pay what's owed  
We're gonna have to reap from some seed that's been sowed  
And the birds up on the wires and the telegraph poles  
They can always fly away from this rain and this cold  
You can hear them singing out their telegraph code  
All the way down the telegraph road  
  
You know, I'd sooner forget, but I remember those nights  
When life was just a bet on a race between the lights  
You had your head on my shoulder, you had your hand in my hair  
Now you act a little colder, like you don't seem to care  
But believe in me, baby, and I'll take you away  
From out of this darkness and into the day  
From these rivers of headlights, these rivers of rain  
From the anger that lives on the streets with these names  
'Cause I've run every red light on memory lane  
I've seen desperation explode into flames  
And I don't want to see it again  
  
From all of these signs saying, "sorry, but we're closed"  
All the way  
Down the telegraph road

Well it's a strange old game - you learn it slow  
One step forward and it's back to go  
You're standing on the throttle  
You're standing on the brakes  
In the groove 'til you make a mistake  
Sometimes you're the windshield  
Sometimes you're the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're a fool in love  
Sometimes you're the louisville slugger  
Sometimes you're the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're going lose it all  
You gotta know happy - you gotta know glad  
Because you're gonna know lonely  
And you're gonna know bad  
When you're rippin' and a ridin'  
And you're coming on strong  
You start slippin' and slidin'  
And it all goes wrong because  
Sometimes you're the windshield  
Sometimes you're the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're a fool in love  
Sometimes you're the louisville slugger baby  
Sometimes you're the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're going lose it all  
One day you got the glory  
One day you got none  
One day you're a diamond  
And then you're a stone  
Everything can change  
In the blink of an eye  
So let the good times roll  
Before we say goodbye, because  
Sometimes you're the windshield  
Sometimes you're the bug  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're a fool in love  
Sometimes you're the louisville slugger baby  
Sometimes you're the ball  
Sometimes it all comes together baby  
Sometimes you're going lose it all

Heard a bell being toll  
Before the break of day  
I heard then my name being called  
Down that long highway  
  
You don't get long  
You don't get long  
You don't get long to stay  
  
Kissing me once and I'll be gone  
Down that long highway  
  
Spirits call from way beyond  
Lord I may not disobey  
Spare a thought for the vagabond  
Down that long highway  
Down that long highway  
Down that long highway

I am just an aging drummer boy  
And in the wars I used to play  
And I've called the tune to many a torture session  
Now they say I am a war criminal  
And I'm fading away  
Father, please hear my confession  
  
I have legalized robbery  
And called it relief  
I have run with the money  
I have hid like a thief  
Rewritten histories with armies and my crooks  
Invented memories  
I did burn all the books  
And I can still hear his laughter  
And I can still hear his song  
The man's too big  
The man's too strong  
  
Well, I've tried to be meek  
I have tried to be mild  
But I spat like a woman  
And I sulked like a child  
Hid behind walls that have made me alone  
Striven for peace  
Which I never have known  
And I can still hear his laughter  
And I can still hear his song  
The man's too big  
The man's too strong  
  
Well, the sun rose on the courtyard  
And we all did hear him say  
"You always was a Judas,  
But I got you anyway.  
You may have got your silver  
But I swear upon my life  
Your sister gave me diamonds  
And I gave 'em to your wife."  
Oh father, please help me  
For I have done wrong  
The man's too big  
The man's too strong

Ticket to heaven  
  
I can see what you're looking to find  
in the smile on my face  
in my peace of mind  
in my state of grace  
I send what I can  
to the man from the ministry  
he's a part of heaven's plan  
and he talks to me  
  
now I send what I can to the man  
with the diamond ring  
he's a part of heaven's plan  
and he sure can sing  
now it's all I can afford  
but the lord has sent me eternity  
it's to save the little children  
in a poor country  
  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
I got a ride all the way to paradise  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
all the way to paradise  
  
now there's nothing left for luxuries  
nothing left to pay my heating bill  
but the good lord will provide  
I know he will  
so send what you can  
to the man with the diamond ring  
they're tuning in across the land  
to hear him sing  
  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
I got a ride all the way to paradise  
I got my  
and everlasting life  
all the way to paradise

We're going on a holiday now  
Gonna take a villa, a small chalet  
On the Costa del Magnifico  
Where the cost of living is so low  
Yeah, we're gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah, we're gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
Sitting in a small cafe now  
Swing, swing, swinging to the cabaret  
You want to see a movie, take in a show now  
Meet new people at the disco  
Yeah, we're gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah, we're gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
And we can still get information  
Reading all about inflation  
And you're never gonna be out of reach  
There's a call-box on the beach  
  
Mmm, you're gonna look so cute  
Sunglasses and a bathing suit  
Be the baby of my dreams  
Like the ladies in the magazines  
Yeah, we're gonna be so neat  
Dance to the Eurobeat  
Yeah, we're gonna be so cool  
Twisting by the pool  
  
I'm a twisting fool  
Just twisting, yeah, twisting  
Twisting by the pool

It was the last day of summer  
It was the first of a new romance  
He walked into her on the corner  
She said, 'I don't dance'  
  
He said, 'Baby let me teach you'  
She said, 'O.K., when?'  
He said, 'How can I reach you baby  
I'd really like to see you again'  
  
He picked her up on a Friday night  
He took her for a bite to eat  
His heart was beating and his hands were shaking  
She thought he was sweet  
  
And he stood on her shoes on the dance floor  
Well, they were doing it cheek to cheek  
And he walked her home and he kissed her  
He was walking on air all week  
  
Well, they couldn't stand to be apart  
They couldn't leave one another alone  
Her mama used to say, 'It's getting late sweetheart  
It's time that boy went home'  
  
And upstairs papa kissed mama  
And she gave him a sweet caress  
He said, 'Here's to the two young lovers  
Let's wish 'em every happiness'  
  
It was the last day of summer  
They came walking home hand in hand  
They went and told her mama  
They showed her the wedding band  
  
Mama cried and poured the wine  
Papa just said God Bless  
Now, here's to the two young lovers  
Let's wish 'em every happiness

Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies  
Be-Bop-A-Lula, Baby What I Say  
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman  
Down in the tunnels trying to make it pay  
He got the action, he got the motion  
Yeah the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning all the night time into the day  
  
He do the song about the sweet loving woman  
He do the song about the knife  
He do the walk, he do the walk of life  
  
Here comes Johnny and he'll tell you the story  
Hand me down my walking shoes  
Here comes Johnny with the power and glory  
Backbeat the talkin' blues  
He got the action, he got the motion  
Yeah the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning all the night time into the day  
  
He do the song about the sweet loving woman  
He do the song about the knife  
He do the walk, he do the walk of life  
  
Here comes Johnny singing oldies, goldies  
Be-Bop-A-Lula Baby What I Say  
Here comes Johnny singing I Gotta Woman  
Down in the tunnels, trying to make it pay  
He got the action, he got the motion  
Yeah the boy can play  
Dedication devotion  
Turning the night time into day  
And after all the violence and double talk  
There's just a song in all the trouble and the strife  
You do the walk, you do the walk of life

High and dry in the long hot day  
Lost and lonely every day  
Got the flats all around me sky up above  
I need a little water of love  
I've been too long lonely and my heart feels pain  
Crying out for some soothing rain  
I believe I have taken enough  
I need a little water of love  
  
Water of love deep in the ground  
No water here to be found  
Some day baby when the river runs free  
It'll carry that water of love to me  
  
There's a bird up in a tree sitting up high  
Waiting for me to die  
If I don't get some water soon  
I'll be dead and gone in the afternoon  
  
Once I had a woman I could call my own  
Once I had a woman now my woman is gone  
Once there was a river now there's a stone  
You know it's evil then you're living alone

There's a shadow hanging over the valley  
A total eclipse of the moon  
Closing up the gates of the city  
The wind it plays a wild tune  
Don't you put a lock on your window  
Don't you put the bar on your door  
Don't you cry for the rain in the sky  
You've seen the storm before  
  
Yea now what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
  
Now lightnings going to strike at midnight  
Thunder going to shake the ground  
Don't you flinch don't give a inch  
Just a let the flood come down  
  
Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wild man yell  
Come on tell me what's the matter with you baby  
Baby what's the matter now  
What's the matter your running in the shadows  
Every time you hear the wildman yell

If we can't get along we oughtta be apart  
And I'm wondering where'd you get that cold, cold heart  
Set me free, sign my release  
I'm tired of being the villain of the piece  
  
You been givin' me a bad time  
Tell me what'd I do  
How come I always get a hard time  
Honey when it comes to you  
Sayin' things that you didn't have to  
How come I always get a hard time  
Honey when it comes to you  
  
You only get one life, this I know  
I wanna get my licks in now before I go  
The fire of love is dead and cold  
I gotta satisfy the hunger in my soul  
  
And you been givin' me a bad time  
Tell me what'd I do  
How come I always get a hard time  
Honey when it comes to you  
Sayin' things that you didn't have to  
How come I always get a hard time  
Honey when it comes to you

Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you know it's dark outside?  
Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you care about my pride?  
Where do you think you're going?  
I thing you don't know  
You got no way of knowing  
There's really no place you can go  
  
I understand your changes  
Long before you reach the door  
I know where you think you're going  
I know what you came here for  
And now I'm sick of jocking  
I know I like you to be free  
Where do you think you're going?  
I think you better go with me girl  
  
You say there is no reason  
But you still find cause to doubt me  
If you ain't with me girl  
You're gonna be without me  
  
Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you know it's dark outside?  
Where do you think you're going?  
Don't you care about my pride?  
And now I'm sick of jocking  
I know I like you to be free  
Where do you think you're going?  
I think you better go with me girl

Stepping out to Angellucci's for my coffee beans  
Checking out the movies and the magazines  
Waitress she watches me crossing from the Barocco Bar  
I'm getting a pickup for my steel guitar  
I saw you walking out Shaftesbury Avenue  
Excuse me for talking I want to marry you  
This is the seventh heaven street to me  
Don't be so proud  
  
You're just another angel in the crowd  
And I'm walking in he wild west end  
Walking with your wild best friend  
And my conductress on the number nineteen  
She was a honey  
  
Pink toenails and hands all dirty with money  
Greasy hair easy smile  
Made me feel nineteen for a while  
And I went down to Chinatown  
In the backroom it's a man's world  
All the money go down  
  
Duck inside the doorway gotta duck to eat  
Right now feels alright now  
You and me we can't beat  
And a gogo dancing girl yes I saw her  
The deejay he say here's Mandy for ya  
I feel alright to see her  
  
But she's paid to do that stuff  
She's dancing high I move on by  
The close ups can get rough  
When you're walking in the wild west end.
