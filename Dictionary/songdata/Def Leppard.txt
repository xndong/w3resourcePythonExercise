Twenty four hours of every day  
I'd walk on glass just to hear you say  
Gettin' it on is like a drug to me  
I want you baby, can't you see  
I'm crashed and I'm crushed and I'm stuck on you  
I'd do anything that you want me to  
I'd crawl on my knees just to get to you  
I close my eyes and girl it's true  
  
On a psychedelic space machine, galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past ninety nine  
Come on, be my  
  
21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious  
21st century, you got solar fire  
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer  
21st century sha la la la girl  
  
Kiss this, you're blowin' my mind  
Never say never, but I'm takin' my time  
Girl to the world from the A to the Z  
I fall for you so easily  
Catch my breath cause I know too well  
That I just can't control myself  
Realize we synchronize  
It's only when i close my eyes  
  
On a psychedelic space machine, galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past 99  
Come on, be my  
  
21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious  
21st century, you got solar fire  
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer  
21st century, she's high on flying  
  
Flying, flying  
You take me up, you set me free  
No time to breathe, just zero G  
High, still flying, no gravity  
She's flying  
  
On a psychedelic space machine, galactic sugar high  
Like a caffeinated satellite gone way past ninety nine  
Come on, be my  
  
21st century girl, all outrageous, quite contagious  
21st century, you got solar fire  
21st century girl, sweet romancer, cosmic dancer  
21st century, high on flying  
21st century, sha la la la girl  
She's a 21st century, sha la la la girl  
21st century, sha la la la girl  
She's a 21st century sha la la la girl

So you think you'll take another piece of me  
To satisfy your intellectual need  
Do you want, do you want...Action?  
Gonna bring you down cause you're pushin' me  
You gotta recognize my superiority  
Liar, liar  
You know you believed it  
Liar, liar  
'Cause I'm the main man  
And that's why  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
Everybody needs a main attraction  
I got what everybody needs  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
I was suicidal cause she was my idol  
Baby baby baby bring it to your knees  
Well there was a time I would have walked the line  
Don't you bring me down with your insatiable greed  
Liar, liar  
You know you believe me  
Liar, liar  
Cause I'm the main man  
And that's why  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
Everybody needs a main attraction  
I got what everybody needs  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
Everybody wants a piece of the action  
Do you want  
Action! Action!  
Everybody wants, everybody needs  
Everybody wants, everybody needs  
Repeat Bridge and Chorus

I don't know how to leave you  
And I don't know how to stay  
I've got things that I must tell you  
That I don't know how to say  
The man behind these empty words  
Is crying out in shame  
Holding on to this sinking ship  
When nothing else remains  
  
[Chorus]  
All I want is everything  
Am I asking too much?  
All I want is everything  
Like the feel of your touch  
But all I have are yesterdays  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
It's hard to hold your head up  
When you're kneeling down to pray  
And talking don't come easy now  
When the words get in the way  
If you could see what's going on  
Behind these private eyes  
The truth would look so easy now  
But I'm running out of lies  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You think the shadow of doubt  
Is hanging over my head  
It's just an angel  
Whose wings hide the sun  
And it's myself I betray  
I cannot wish this away  
Took my chance  
Now the damage is done  
  
[Chorus]

I like a woman who loves to drive  
Loves to do it fast, yeah, above 95  
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh yeah  
  
I love a woman who likes to make me sweat  
Who'll come on round lookin' for love, get what she can get  
Show me babe what's on your mind  
I wanna feel ya one more time  
  
All night, I like it, all night  
  
I want love, oh, yeah  
I wanna make love, baby, oh, yeah  
I wanna make love, child  
  
All night, I wanna do it  
All night, oh give me love baby  
All night, I wanna have ya  
All night, I want to taste you  
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah, oh yeah  
  
C'mon baby it's showtime  
Give it to me, give it to me  
  
I like a woman who wants to be the star  
She'll lick a man more further than he's ever been before  
(Give it to me)  
Show me babe what's on your mind  
I wanna feel you one more time  
  
All night, I like it, all night

Oh, ah, make a little love, baby  
Oh, ah, make a little love, child  
  
All night, I wanna do it  
All night, oh give me love baby  
All night, I wanna have ya  
All night, I want to taste you there  
  
You shouldn't wanna do what you wouldn't want me to  
You didn't say you wouldn't and you shouldn't but you do  
  
Let's get personal, give it to me  
Oh baby, it's showtime give it to me  
Give me baby, give it to me  
Oh I like that, give it to me  
Give it to me baby  
Don't think, don't think  
Don't think, just do it, do it, do it  
  
Oh, ah, make a little love, baby  
Oh, ah, make a little love, child  
  
All night, I wanna do it  
All night, oh give a little love baby  
All night, I wanna have you  
All night  
  
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me  
I wanna do it  
All night, oh give me love baby  
All night, I wanna have ya  
All night, I want to taste you

When the night time unfolds and the memories that you hold  
Bring a light to your eyes though you know it's disguise  
When the night turns to day you turn around and say  
Magic mirror please tell is this heaven or hell?  
Answer to the master  
  
Can you look to the sky? Can you live through your lie?  
Of the thoughts you can't trace which time can't erase  
To a face on the wall do you often recall  
What you said on the night when the new full moon was rising?  
Answer to the master

Answer to the master  
Answer to the master

Ya better come inside when you're ready to  
But no chance if ya don't want to dance  
You're like four letter words when you're ready to  
But then you won't 'cause you know that you can  
You got it, but are you gettin' it?  
You say that love is won when you get some  
But then your finger won't trigger the gun  
You know you (ya) can't stop it  
So don't rock it  
You know you got it  
Hey, but are you gettin' it?  
Really gettin' it?

Ooh, really gettin' it? Yes, Armageddon it!  
  
You try comin' on when you need some  
But then you don't 'cause you already did  
Yeah, you jangle your jewels while your shakin' ya  
And drive the pretty boys outta their heads  
You got it, but are you gettin' it?  
You flash you bedroom eyes like a jumpin' jack  
Then play it pretty with a pat on the back  
You know you (ya) can't stop it  
So don't rock it  
You know you got it  
Hey, but are you gettin' it?  
Ooh, really gettin' it?  
Come get it from me  
  
C'mon, Steve, get it  
Take it, take it, take it from me  
I got an itchy finger following me  
Pull it, pull it, c'mon trigger the gun  
Cause the best is (a) yet to come, I say  
Cause the best is yet to come  
Are you gettin' it? Really gettin' it?  
Oh, come get it from me  
  
Gimme all of your lovin', ev'ry little bit  
Gimme all that you got, ev'ry bit of it  
Ev'ry bit of your lovin', oh, come on live a bit

Ooh baby live it, gimme all that you got

Oh live a bit, never want it to stop

Hey, hey, hey  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back  
  
Hey, hey  
I can stand tall, I can stick out a mile  
I can come crawlin' like a hungry reptile  
  
I'm coming' around, I'm wired for sound  
Shakin' it for all it's a-worth  
I'm a spaced-out alien, a techno-sapien  
Crashin' on down to earth  
  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back  
  
I can pour your drink and be the perfect host  
I can scare the pants off the holiest ghost  
  
I'm coming' around, I'm wired for sound  
Shakin' it for all it's a-worth  
I'm a spaced-out alien, a techno-sapien  
Crashin' on down to earth  
  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back  
  
Back in the middle, back in the ring  
Backin' a winner, it's a sure shot thing  
Back in your good books I did you no wrong  
Here I am honey, I back where I belong  
Belong, belong, belong  
  
I'm back  
Well, I'm back  
Yeah I'm back  
You better believe that I'm back  
Now lemme tell you I'm back  
Can't you see that I'm back  
Come on and do it, I'm back  
There's nothing to it, I'm back  
  
I'm back in your face like I've never been away  
I'm back in your face and it's where I'm gonna stay  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
I'm back in your face and don't it feel so good  
I'm back in your face and just like I knew that it would  
Like a runaway mack, like a union jack  
Sheer heart attack and a Jumpin' Jack Flash  
Like a leader of the pack  
And as a matter of fact I'm back

Twenty-one years and you answer the call  
Hollywood screams from your bedroom wall  
You can't get away from the thrill of it all  
  
[Chorus]  
Bye-bye baby  
Get me out of here I'm done  
A girl gone crazy  
You ain't foolin' anyone  
  
You can't sing can't dance  
Can't fit in your pants  
You're a bad actress  
You can't run can't walk gotta learn how to talk  
You're a bad actress  
  
Come on down and walk the moonlit mile  
You've got the perfect teeth  
You've got the perfect smile  
You do it all wrong but you do it in style  
Oh yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't sing can't dance  
Can't fit in your pants  
You're a bad actress  
You can't run can't walk gotta learn how to talk  
You're a bad actress  
  
You can't read can't write gotta learn how to fight  
You're a bad actress  
You're too cold too old and the story's been told bout  
The bad actress  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't sing can't dance  
Can't fit in your pants  
You're a bad actress  
  
You can't run can't walk gotta learn how to talk  
You're a bad actress  
  
You can't read can't write gotta learn how to fight  
You're a bad actress  
  
You're too cold too old and the story's been told bout  
The the bad actress  
  
Oh Yeah  
Bad actress  
Oh  
Bad actress  
No good  
Bad actress  
Too bad  
  
Ah what's a girl like you doing in a nice place like this?

Beyond the temple  
There lies a tomb with a king from long ago  
A traveler from a distant planet  
Ten thousand years or so  
The legend tells of an agin' man  
Whose city he built alone  
Till the pirates of our western world  
Tore it down stone by stone  
  
The clouds are gettin' heavy  
As he points unto the sky  
But with the guidance of his finger  
He let the lightning fly  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
He gathered up his people  
And he took them underground  
To the caves of silvery water  
Where they never could be found  
  
The king came to the surface  
Could not believe what he had found  
The temple left in ruins  
His city knocked to the ground  
  
He went back to his people  
Sad news he had to tell  
The only justice for the king  
Was to put these men in hell  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
  
His face showing sorrow  
His heart full of grief  
His life's work in ruins  
Destroyed by a thief  
  
His people just sit around  
His children just cry  
The king's mind is all confused  
Just wonderin' why  
  
The temple split in half  
And scattered through the desert  
The dust had risen in the air  
The race of people had to live in devastation  
Why wasn't he even there?  
  
Message from the gods to gather up his people  
The kingdom couldn't lose them there  
That's when all the gods and all are livin' peaceful  
Just a galaxy away  
  
The king rose up from underground  
To light the darkened sky  
Red lights, green lights, blue lights flashing  
It seemed a mile high  
  
As it lifted from the ground  
And soared into the air  
The king looked at what might have been  
A world that needed care  
  
A storm had risen quickly  
Across the take of hope  
Now there's no trace of the king  
Just a memory carved in stone  
  
So don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Lightning don't strike twice  
Don't turn around, don't turn around  
Death is a very high price

Billy's got a gun, he's on the run  
Confusion in his mind, the blind leads the blind  
Yeah, Billy's got a gun, he's gonna shoot ya down  
He's got evil in his eyes, got a reason to despise  
There's danger in the air  
  
Can you feel it in the air?  
Danger (Such a strange emotion)  
Can you feel it in the air?  
  
Oh he was locked inside a room without a door  
His innocence he suffered for  
In a world of black and white, they were wrong and he was right  
Just looking for a clue, it's a nightmare come true  
He's going underground to track that danger down  
Oh Billy, why you got that gun?  
  
Never give him an even break  
Gettin' caught is the chance you take  
It could be your last mistake  
(You could be so helpless)  
As a bird with a broken wing  
Like a sheep in a lion's den  
Gonna fall but you won't know when  
  
You hear footsteps in the night, see shadows on the wall  
And the ghastly sound of silence, as the mist begins to fall  
Then a scream rang out like thunder, but the lightning was too late  
  
As the rain came down on the crimson ground  
It was the hand of fate  
And a crowd of people gathered round, but Billy couldn't wait

Let me down slow an' easy  
'Cause there ain't nothin' I can do  
I hope and pray, my faith won't leave me  
When it comes down to me an' you  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin' next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Overflow of emotion  
And a hurt that'll never heal  
If you close the door forever  
The fate of pain is sealed  
Try a little tenderness  
I die a little  
For a long lost sweet caress  
You lyin' next to me  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
I more than long for your affection  
You tell me now that ain't so  
Not even gentle persuasion  
Is ever gonna let me go  
You lyin' next to me, yea  
Fulfilled some destiny  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Just a little bit of lettin' go, yea  
I don't want you to know  
I wanna cry  
But I breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Let me breathe  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Won't you let me breathe?  
Breathe a sigh  
Won't you let me breathe?  

Gypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty  
The broken rose with laughin' eyes  
You're a mystery, always runnin' wild  
Like a child without a home  
You're always searching, searching for a feeling  
That it's easy come and easy go  
  
Oh I'm sorry but it's true  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Takin' all the best of me  
Oh can't you see?  
You got the best of me  
Whoa can't you see?  
  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache

Oh whoa  
You're such a secret, misty eyed and shady  
Lady how you hold the key  
Oh you're like a candle, your flame slowly fadin'  
Burnin' out and burnin' me  
  
Can't you see?  
Just try and say to you  
  
You're bringin' on the heartache  
Takin' all the best of me  
Oh can't you see?  
You got the best of me  
Whoah can't you see?  
  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak  
Bringin' on the heartache  
You're bringin' on the heartbreak

Friday night and I crashed your party  
Saturday night and I crashed your car

Couldn't believe I even got that far  
Look out of your bedroom window

Get on my knees and it's making me worse  
There's no way out so I pay lip-service  
If this thing is bigger than the both of us  
  
If you could just walk for a mile in my shoes  
If you don't use loose your mind you got no mind to lose  
  
Bang bang gonna shoot you down  
I got me a gun but I gotta get a better one  
Sweetheart.....buzzing like a fly

Like a ray of sunshine, she comes, heaven in my arms

Gonna keep on coming back again  
  
When i see you smilin'  
It takes away my pain

The moon and lover's shadows, they go slippin' through our hands  
I don't want to take your love in vain  
Gonna keep on coming back again

Gonna keep on coming back again

Don't stop runnin', I'm a fool for the chase  
Play the game, surrender to me  
Baby, I don't wanna fake it  
  
Is it any wonder, you got me comin' under fire?  
Comin' like thunder, you know you make me walk the wire  
  
It's so easy to put on a show  
Your body says yes but you won't let it go  
But my passion it won't slip away  
  
You got me, I'm cornered, my back to the wall  
No bed of roses, ain't no bed at all  
I'm walkin' the wire, I stumble and fall  
I got the message but I ain't gonna crawl

I close my eyes, I bend in pray  
I train my mind, to just not care  
And to my god, I give my soul  
I train my mind to cruise control  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight shines upon the hour, of my faith  
I step into the sun I shield my eyes from the glory of the moment  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
I hear my god, he calls my name  
I most of have told, all men can change  
And for my god, I ring the bell  
I will condemn the infidel  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight shines upon the hour of my soul  
I step into the sun I shield my eyes from the glory of the moment  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
For when I was a boy you came to me  
I made up my mind  
Surrender or die  
And space to you  
I'm Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
[Chorus]  
Daylight shines upon the hour, of my faith  
I step into the sun I shield my eyes from the glory of the moment  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come  
  
Going to blow it all to kingdom come

Here comes the flood  
Can you feel the love  
Washin' over you  
Like a tidal wave inside of you  
  
Here comes the night  
Can you see the light  
Shinin' like the sun  
You want to hide  
But it's got you on the run  
  
Every word you say  
Is takin' your breath away  
  
Cry, the demons that you hide  
Screamin' through the night  
They won't forget you  
  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Need, the circus you gotta feed  
The wound that never heals  
  
It don't let go  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
  
She's here again  
Your only friend  
Watchin' over you  
She never takes her eyes away from you  
She's wide awake  
  
And she lies in wait  
Your chosen bride  
A mother, a lover  
The kick inside  
  
Every single day  
It's takin' your breath away  
  
Cry, the demons that you hide  
Screamin' through the night  
They won't forget you  
  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Need, the circus you gotta feed  
  
The wound that never heals  
It don't let go  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
  
It's been so long since I come undone  
I'm slippin' in to my second skin  
  
Cry, the demons that you hide  
Screamin' through the night  
They won't forget you  
  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Need, the circus you gotta feed  
The wound that never heals  
  
It don't let go  
Comin' down, comin' down  
Comin' down, comin' down

You know me, just look in my eyes  
I shed my skin, got a new disguise  
My heart still beats and I'm still the same  
Do you know my name  
  
It's everything you've ever seen  
It's every dream you've broken  
It's only when you keep your eyes wide open  
  
Like a circle of light spinnin' out of control  
and I just can't let go  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day  
  
I feel you, you're under my skin  
You look in the mirror, you know where I've been  
My heart still beats but it's not the same  
Don't you know my name  
  
I'm always there to keep your eyes wide open  
  
Like a circle of light spinnin' out of control  
And I just can't let go  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day  
  
Like a circle of light spinnin' out of control  
And I just can't let go  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day  
  
Day after day  
  
Day after day there's a voice deep inside me  
Day after day there's the ghost of a lie  
Every belief that has come back to find me  
Day after day and it follows me blindly  
Day after day

I'm tired of feeling hateful  
I'm tired and I can't breathe  
So tired that I would be grateful  
If you close the door when you leave  
  
That's me diggin' my heels in  
That's me with the Holy Ghost  
'Scuse me but I don't remember  
Where were you when I needed you most  
  
And I'm tied to the sky  
As you claw at my eyes  
And I wait for the flood  
I swim in blood  
As I crawl to my knees  
And I beg your disease  
Taste the ice on your breath  
As you catch your death  
  
I close my eyes  
Embrace me  
Deliver me  
  
Hey you, the voice of reason  
Hey you, are you listening to me  
It's you that I can't believe in  
I don't buy what I don't see  
Say goodbye 'cause I don't need  
  
I close my eyes  
Embrace the wave  
Abandon me  
  
Save the day  
That I won't see  
Deliver me

Let me loose I just got back  
I was pushed and I got dragged  
I tasted mud, I tasted wine  
I've kissed the life I've left behind  
So say I choose to stick around  
I got news for this here town  
I kick the ball, I catch the bus  
And raise the roof for all of us  
  
Destination anywhere  
So far gone, I'm almost there  
Can't you see I can't deny  
I'm out of here like I'm on fire  
  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man  
  
Steal your car and leave a wreck  
Kiss your bride, I cash your check  
And Tyson plus, I'm ripped and torn  
Been on the edge since I was born  
I kick the jukebox, change the tune  
I break the bank and jump the moon  
I sink the fleet to catch a buzz  
And raise a glass for all of us  
  
Destination anywhere  
So far gone, I'm almost there  
Can't you see I can't deny  
I'm out of here like I'm on fire  
  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man  
  
I'm a beast in space  
I'm an acid taste  
I'm a primitive gong stuffed in your face  
It's enough to bring you to your knees  
  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything, everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man  
Living like a caged-up animal, criminal  
Television newsman so subliminal  
Bringing down the walls of wonderland  
Just another highbrow cowboy telling me  
Everything and everyone and all the things I ought to be  
Here I am, your demolition man

Let's welcome home the soldier boy from (far away, far away)  
No angel of mercy just a need to destroy (fire away, fire away)  
Let's toast the hero with blood in his eyes  
The scars on his mind took so many lives  
Die hard the hunter  
  
Welcome home soldier boy  
Put down your pistol, yeah, put down your toy  
Yeah, they can take a gun away from you  
But never take away your attitude  
They can't do that, no, they can't do that  
  
You got no enemy, no front line  
The only battles in the back of your mind  
You don't know how to change from bad to good  
You brought the war to your neighborhood  
You can't do that, no, you can't do that  
  
Back in the city, he's a man on the loose  
He is the shadow that's following you  
He takes no prisoners when he's hunting for game  
He's got a bullet and it carries your name  
  
(Die Hard) Caught in a trap  
(Hunter) There's no lookin' back  
(Die Hard) He's hides in the crowd  
(Hunter) Die Hard and proud

Don't believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you  
  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
That I wrote this song for you  
There might be some other silly pretty girl  
I'm singing it to  
  
Don't believe a word  
For words are only spoken  
Your heart is like a promise  
Made to be broken  
  
Don't believe a word  
Words can tell lies  
And lies are no comfort  
When there's tear in your eyes  
  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Not a word of this is true  
Don't believe me if I tell you  
Especially if I tell you that I'm in love with you  
  
Don't believe a word

Run  
(Run for cover)  
For for cover  
Don't shoot!  
Shoot!  
She's so dangerous  
(Shotgun!)  
(Gun!)  
(Don't shoot shotgun!)  
Maybe I'm wrong, maybe I'm right  
Fallin' head over heals at the speed of light  
Hey little miss heaven on earth  
Whoa, won't you walk this way but I see a red alert  
Oh, my senses say keep away  
So don't shoot!  
Don't shoot shotgun  
Dream on nightmare  
Touch 'n' go  
Dove turned destroyer, she cut you up, she's a slave of love  
Run for cover, she's so dangerous  
Undercover, she's so shameless  
Don't shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin' my lip  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Ya shootin' straight from the hip  
So don't shoot shotgun  
Shoot me, baby!  
Ow!  
Hit 'n' miss, flesh and blood  
She's sweet and indiscreet, she can't get enough  
A little midnight madness  
Oh baby, you can't hide  
So wild 'n' unpredictable  
Step aside  
'cause you're, you're shooting wide  
Run for cover, she's so dangerous  
Undercover, she's so shameless  
Don't shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin' my lip  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Ya shootin' straight from the hip  
Oh  
Shake it, shake it!  
Ah, take this, little hit 'n' miss  
Oh  
Don't shoot shotgun  
You got me bitin' my lip  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Ya shootin' straight from the hip  
Don't shoot it!  
Don't shoot shotgun!  
Shake it, shake it!  
Aw, take this little hit 'n' miss  
Ow!  
(Don't shoot! Shotgun!)  
Oh shoot it!  
Don't shoot it!  
Uh, Oh shotgun!  
Shoot me, baby!  
Ow!  
Let it blow!

Let me put my arms  
Around your head  
Gee, it's hot, let's go to bed  
Don't forget to turn on the light  
Don't laugh babe, it'll be alright  
Pour me out another phone  
I'll ring and see  
If your friends are home  
Perhaps the strange ones in the dome  
Can lend us a book we can read up alone  
  
And try to get it on like once before  
When people stared in Jagger's eyes  
And scored  
Like the video films we saw  
  
[Chorus:]  
His name was always Buddy  
And he'd shrug and ask to stay  
She'd sigh like Twig the Wonder Kid  
And turn her face away  
She's uncertain if she likes him  
But she knows she really loves him  
It's a crash course for the ravers  
It's a Drive-in Saturday  
  
Jung the foreman prayed at work  
That neither hands nor limbs would burst  
It's hard enough to keep formation  
Amid this fall out saturation  
  
Cursing at the Astronette 8  
Who stands in steel  
By his cabinet  
He's crashing out with Sylvian  
The Bureau Supply  
For ageing men  
  
With snorting head he gazes to the shore  
Which once had raised a sea  
That raged no more  
Like the video films we saw  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's a Drive-in Saturday [repeat]

I'm your top prime cut of meat, I'm your choice  
I wanna be elected  
I'm a yankee doodle dandy in a gold Rolls Royce  
I wanna be elected  
The kids need a savior, they don't want a fake  
I wanna be elected  
We're all gonna rock to the rules that I make  
I wanna be elected  
  
Elected  
Elected  
Respected  
I wanna be selected  
  
I never lied to you, I've always been cool  
I wanna be elected  
I have to get the votes, I told you about school  
I wanna be elected  
  
Elected  
Elected  
Hallelujah  
I wanna be selected, come on  
Ooh yeah  
  
We're gonna rock this place, take the country by storm  
I wanna be elected  
You and me together, young and strong  
I wanna be elected  
  
Elected  
Elected  
Respected, selected, call collected  
I wanna be elected, oh, oh, come on  
This time

I gave in when you gave out  
You showed me the way to love  
There ain't no doubt  
Always together and never apart  
  
Disappeared, didn't say a word  
Slept right through, guess I never heard  
Now I'm awake but I wish I was dreamin'  
  
Everyday without you in my heart  
Everyday I'm fallin' apart  
And I know you know I think about you  
Everyday  
  
I woke up and you were gone  
Just one night without you  
Is too long  
  
Sleeping with the ghost of you  
Dying with or without you  
Don't want to feel this way tomorrow  
  
Everyday without you in my heart  
Everyday I'm fallin' apart  
And I know you know I think about you  
Everyday  
  
Don't know what you got until it's gone  
  
Everyday without you in my heart  
Everyday I'm fallin' apart  
And I know you know I think about you  
Everyday 'til I see you again  
Everyday I'll try to pretend  
That I know you know I think about you  
  
Everyday  
Outta my head all the days are confused  
Everyday  
I'm lost but it's you that I don't want to lose  
Everyday  
We're torn 'til we're givin' ourselves to each other

Ballistic (a) lipstick dream machine

Shakin' and shiverin'

Lady luck never smiles  
So lend your love to me awhile  
Do with me what you will  
Break the spell take your fill  
On and on we rode the storm  
The flame has died and the fire has gone  
Oh, this empty bed is a night alone  
I realized that long ago  
  
Is anybody out there, anybody there  
Does anybody wonder, anybody care  
  
Oh, I just gotta know  
If you're really there and you really care  
Cause baby I'm not  
  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
Won't you stay with me awhile  
  
Close your eyes don't run and hide  
Easy love is no easy ride  
Just wakin' up from what we had  
Could stop good love from going bad  
  
Is anybody out there, anybody there  
Does anybody wonder, anybody care  
  
Oh, I just gotta know  
If you're really there and you really care  
Cause baby I'm not  
  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
  
Oh, I just gotta know  
If you're really there and you really care  
'Cause baby I'm not  
  
F-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
Not f-f-f-foolin', ah f-f-foolin'  
  
I'm not foolin' myself  
I'm not foolin' myself  
I'm not foolin' myself  
I'm not foolin' myself

Ain't just your kiss, K-I-S-S, that I miss  
Ain't just the way that you squeeze me tight  
If there's a wish at the top of my list  
Is that you be there everyday and every night  
  
I found a new four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
I found a new four letter word  
Lust can kinda be nice  
But it ain't L-O-V-E  
  
Indeedy  
Alright  
  
And when the rush that I'm dreamin' of's not enough  
You touch and I can't control myself  
You put the glide back into my stride, oh yeah  
You move me like nobody else  
  
I found a new four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
I found a new four letter word  
Lust can kinda be nice  
But it ain't L-O-V-E  
  
Oh yeah  
Let me spell it out  
C'mon  
  
You're all I'm lookin' for  
You ain't the girl next door  
You're real and so much more  
You put me to shame  
And then you walk right in  
You know I can't explain  
Here come that lovin' thing  
All over again  
  
Live life just like a wild ride  
More like a landslide  
Take me away  
  
New four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
I found a new four letter word  
The sweetest sound that I ever heard  
New four letter word  
And baby, the sweetest sound that I ever heard  
New four letter word  
  
Hey  
Lust can kinda be nice  
But it ain't L-O-V-E

I am bad, I am evil  
I am winter, I am pain  
I'll mess up your life  
I'll beat up your wife  
I'll lose all your friends  
And I'll win in the end  
  
So you play the Joker  
And I'll play the clown  
And I'll laugh while you're up there  
And I'll laugh when you're down  
Though your screams break the silence  
Oh, they won't make a sound  
Na na na na na na na  
  
I will rise, I will take you  
I will break you, never let you go  
I'll shoot through your veins  
I'll drive you insane  
I'll poison your breath  
And I'll love you to death  
  
So you be the joker  
And I'll be the clown  
And you'll laugh when you're up there  
But you'll cry when you're down  
Though your screams break the silence  
Oh, they won't make a sound  
Na na na na na na na  
  
So you be the joker  
And I'll be the clown  
And you'll laugh when you're up there  
But you'll cry when you're down  
Though your screams break the silence  
Oh, they won't make a sound  
Na na na na na na naaa

I am all destiny, a trade, a grain of sand  
I take the throat of innocence and leave decay  
I stain the way for all to see  
  
No fear, no voice, no reason  
In god no guiding light  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held high  
  
Indulge and multiply and sacrifice  
As lack of breath chokes underground  
Divulge degenerate, the darker side  
From windows watch the screaming sky  
  
No fear, no voice, no reason  
In god no guiding light  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held  
  
When all the guilt that's in your head  
Turns its back and plays for dead  
You scorch the earth and torch the sky  
Conscience low with head held high  
  
From the truth comes all the shame  
The curse of flesh just takes it aim  
On hallowed ground and tortured sky  
Walk in fear with spirits high

I need it right now

But I need it right now

It's gotta last

Boy meets girl in prime of life  
Blinded by big city lights  
I'm on fire and you're the flame  
You inspire the road I take  
You take me to a better place  
You're the sun and I'm the rain  
  
You're all that I need to make me believe  
I'm over the edge but I'm not afraid  
Cause I know it's true  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You  
  
You were raised to be so good  
I grew up misunderstood  
We were distant worlds apart  
Feels so right it's meant to be  
Shootin' stars and chemistry  
They unite a beating heart  
  
You're pullin' me up, I can't get enough  
Comin' on strong but I'm not that tough  
But I know it's true  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
  
You  
You  
  
With a girl like you (like you) to be by my side  
With a girl like you, love me for the inside  
With a girl like you I set the scene to follow  
With a girl like you, love for all tomorrow  
With a girl like  
You

Hello and welcome my friend  
It's good to see you again  
Do you know anything new  
Tell me is this really you  
Hey, what's the story in LA  
I haven't been there today  
It's time we went for a ride  
Come on and step right inside  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
  
Darkness our sole destination  
Daylight our only intention  
White lightning brightens the sky  
Can't tell we're flying so high  
Rest now and don't be afraid  
Can't you see we've got it made  
Just cause I'm not going far  
That doesn't mean that we can't reach the stars  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
  
Sad story that look in your eyes  
Break out before it's too late  
Now come and lay down by my side  
Let all the thoughts slip away  
  
Too many people have waited  
Too many problems created  
Too many jitterbugs not enough jive  
I'm tired of sitting here waiting  
We should be out there creating  
It's times like this that I'm glad I'm alive  
I'm alive  
Alive

This is a truth adjust  
Has to be told, it must  
We spread amongst us so the world can hear it  
We got to get it right  
This time, if we just fight  
Innocence starts tonight  
If we can heal it  
  
[Bridge]  
We look to our leaders with the lies they try to feed us  
Like a knife they try to bleed us  
And they cut us real slow  
  
[Chorus]  
So go,  
Just go  
Just go  
You hide behind your mask of desperation  
Go  
Just go  
Just go  
I won't surrender to the last temptation  
  
You have no dignity  
I have no sympathy  
You are my enemy  
But I can't see you  
  
No matter where you run  
Thy kingdom will be done  
A rocket to the sun  
Is where I see you  
  
Endless senses get ecstatic  
Overflow is automatic  
Feel the need to feel erratic  
Don't deny it let it flow  
  
So go,  
Just go  
Just go  
You hide behind your mask of desperation  
Go  
Just go  
Just go  
I won't surrender to this fake salvation  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

Feelin' like it's all over, feelin' like there's no love  
Feelin' like it's not easy, breathin' life in the dust  
On a countdown to zero take a ride on the nightmare machine  
  
There ain't gonna be heroes  
There ain't gonna be anything  
Oh  
Here it comes, here comes the night  
Here it comes, hell in the night  
Here it comes, here comes the night  
  
When we all fall down  
When we walk into silence  
When we shadow the sun  
When we surrender to violence  
Oh  
Then the damage is done  
Put away that gun!  
  
I don't want to be there  
I don't want to be anywhere  
Oh!  
  
That's right!  
We're fightin' for the gods of war but what the hell we fightin' for?  
We're fightin' with the gods of war but I'm a rebel  
  
And I ain't gonna fight no more no way!  
On a countdown to zero  
Take a ride on the nightmare machine  
There ain't gonna be heroes  
(Whoa)  
There ain't gonna be anything  
No!  
  
That's right!  
We're fightin' for the gods of war but what the hell we fightin' for?  
We're fightin' with the gods of war but I'm a rebel  
  
Don't ya know that's right  
  
And (a) I ain't gonna fight no more  
  
(Stop)  
Stop fightin' for the gods of war  
(Stop fightin' for the gods of war)  
Yeah what the hell we fightin' for?  
(What in the hell we fightin' for?)  
We're fightin' with the gods of war  
Heavy!

Well good morning freedom  
I've been woken to a brand new day  
Good morning freedom  
Now it seems that you have a different way  
Starts today  
  
So now I'm free  
And now you're ready to take my chance again  
So come with me  
And I'll take you to the rainbow's end  
  
Oh good morning freedom  
I'd like to take you by the hand  
And if you doubt me  
Just listen to the fan  
And you'll understand  
  
So now I'm free  
And now you're ready to take my chance again  
So come with me  
And I'll take you to the rainbow's end  
  
So now I'm free  
And now you're ready to take my chance again  
So come with me

I've been waiting, goin' crazy  
I can't sleep when I know you're not around  
I've been saving what you're cravin'  
Look at my face I'm about to replace  
Every hurt, every tear that you cry  
  
Cause when you feel this strong and you can't go on  
There's nothing wrong, just try to realize  
  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
You won't ever have to say "I've wasted all my time"  
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems  
Just look into my eyes  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
  
I'm just praying, you hear me saying  
I'd be there if the sun refused to shine  
As the night gets colder I will be your shoulder  
I give you my heart until death us do part  
Every day, every moment, forever  
  
Cause when the love is strong the feeling's never gone  
There's nothing wrong in trying to realize  
  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
You won't ever have to say "I've wasted all my time"  
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems  
Just look into my eyes  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
  
Cause when your feeling's strong and you can't go on  
There's nothing wrong, just try to realize  
  
You won't ever have to say goodbye  
You won't ever have to say "I've wasted all my time"  
If the dream you dream ain't what it seems  
Just look into my eyes  
You won't ever have to say goodbye

Can't sleep at night  
The darkness enslaves me  
I turn out the light  
And no one can save me  
  
So try not to stare 'cause I'm stripped to the bone  
It's a trick of the light and I'm lost  
  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
Insanity inside of me  
It's like I'm wide awake  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Can't recognize, I'm hypnotized  
These feelings can't be fake  
(Can't take it all)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down  
  
I lie to myself  
It don't make it easy  
If somebody else  
Would only believe me  
  
My sweat soaks the sheets and I'm hung out to dry  
It's a trick of the light and I'm lost  
  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
  
Wake up  
Don't try to catch me  
Just let me fall  
Eyes wide shut  
Don't make a sound  
Keep fallin' till I hit the ground  
  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
Insanity inside of me  
It's like I'm wide awake  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Can't recognize, I'm hypnotized  
These feelings can't be fake  
(Can't take it all)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Gravity is draggin' me  
My head's about to break  
(Can't break my fall)  
Insanity inside of me  
It's like I'm wide awake  
Feel like I'm fallin'  
Can't recognize, I'm hypnotized  
These feelings can't be fake  
(Can't take it all)  
This gravity is killin' me  
I can't stand up for fallin' down

Guilty as sin, yes I confess  
I can't deny  
Strong in the heart, weak in the flesh  
I never meant to do you wrong  
  
I swear the soul gets blistered along the way  
But when you hurt the things you love  
You gotta know  
  
If you mean hope, if you mean fear  
Of those words that you've been longing to hear  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty, I'm guilty of all the above  
  
Can't hide the truth, I stand accused  
Don't ask me why  
I question every move and thought I had  
That's going on inside  
  
I swear the soul gets blistered along the way  
But when you hurt the things you love  
You gotta know  
  
If you mean hope, if you mean fear  
All those words that you've been longing to hear  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty  
And if it's wrong to feel this right  
I can't help it and I won't fight  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty, I'm guilty of all the above  
  
It's not my first offense and it won't be the last  
I would not change a thing except what's in the past  
  
If you mean hope, if you mean fear  
All those words that you've been longing to hear  
If you mean faith, if you mean love  
Then I'm guilty of loving you  
If you mean hope (guilty), if you mean fear, never said I was innocent  
(Heal me)  
Wrap your arms around me  
If you mean, if you mean love and it's you that I want  
And I won't fight  
And if it's wrong, it feels right  
Guilty, guilty

Your a roxette  
Undeniable  
Unobtainable  
Is what you are  
In a word  
Indestructible  
Your a cannonball  
Your a star  
  
Gettin' wild  
Gettin' free  
Gettin' touched  
Can't you see  
Gettin' first gallantry  
Get your hands off of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Hallucinate  
It's in your head  
Hallucinate  
In every word you say  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
It's more than you can take  
  
Its the way you act  
Its the way you feel  
In your Cadillac  
In your car  
Cause the sheer you wear  
Anything you dare  
Like a superstar  
Is what you are  
  
Let it loose  
Let it go  
Be the last to know  
Get it back  
Get on track  
Be the first to crow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gettin' wild  
Gettin' free  
Gettin' touched  
Can't you say  
Gettin' first gallantry  
Get your hands off of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hallucinate  
It's in your head  
Hallucinate  
In every word you say  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucinate  
Its more than you can take  
  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination  
Hallucinate  
Hallucination

I'm in the phone booth, it's the one across the hall  
If you don't answer, I'll just ring it off the wall  
I know he's there, but I just had to call  
  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
I heard your mother now she's going out the door  
Did she go to work or just go to the store  
  
All those things she said, I told you to ignore  
Oh why can't we talk again  
Oh why can't we talk again  
Oh why can't we talk again  
  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
It's good to hear your voice, you know it's been so long  
If I don't get your call then everything goes wrong  
I want to tell you something you've known all along  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
I had to interrupt and stop this conversation  
Your voice across the line gives me a strange sensation  
I'd like to talk when I can show you my affection  
  
Oh I can't control myself  
Oh I can't control myself  
Oh I can't control myself  
Don't leave me hanging on the telephone  
  
Hang up and run to me  
Whoah, hang up and run to me  
Whoah, hang up and run to me  
Whoah, hang up and run to me  
Whoah oh oh oh run to me

Here I am, I'm in the wrong bed again  
It's a game I just can't win  
There you are breathin' soft on my skin, yeah  
Still you won't let me in  
  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  
  
[Chorus]  
Have you ever needed someone so bad, yeah  
Have you ever wanted someone  
You just couldn't have  
Did you ever try so hard  
That your world just fell apart  
Have you ever needed someone so bad  
  
And to the girl I gotta have  
I gotta have you baby  
  
There you go, midnight promises again, yeah  
But they're broken by the dawn  
You want to go further, faster every day, baby  
But in the morning you'll be gone  
And I'm alone  
  
Why save your kisses for a rainy day  
Baby let the moment take your heart away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every dream I dream is like  
Some kinds rash 'n' reckless scene  
To give out such crazy love  
You must be some kind of drug  
And if my time don't' ever come  
For me you're still the one  
Damned if I don't, damned if I do  
I gotta get a fix on you  
  
[Chorus]

What can I hear? Who can I see?  
What's this I fear that's followin' me?  
It's getting louder, it's coming near  
I can not stand it, I'm gettin' outta here  
  
You'd better beware now  
You'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner  
  
The rain is falling around my feet  
The night is calling on this well-lit street  
People in doorways just stand and stare  
Castaway shadows that really aren't there  
  
You'd better beware now  
You'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner  
  
What can I hear? Who can I see?  
What's this I fear that's followin' me?  
It's getting louder, it's coming near  
I can not stand it, I'm getting outta here  
  
You'd better beware now  
Yeah you'd better take care now  
The street of the sinner  
So you'll never be a winner  
  
You'll never be a winner  
On heat street

Hey boys, Miss Magic is back  
No Hollywood waste or tinsel trash  
Street kid, she's no stray cat  
Heaven on legs she's feline flash  
Takes a good woman to play a good man  
And no one plays like heaven can  
  
She said leave your name  
At the sound of the tone  
Call you right back  
When I get home  
Better watch out  
When we're all alone  
  
Heaven is a girl I know so well  
She makes me feel good when I feel like hell  
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have  
She makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad  
  
Hey guys, Miss Magic is mine  
No silicone smile she's a vintage wine  
Bombshell blond, red lipstick on  
Aquiline fine, she's a real wild one  
  
She said leave your name  
At the sound of the tone  
Call you right back  
When I get home  
Better watch out  
When we're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Heaven is a girl I know so well  
She makes me feel good when I feel like hell  
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have  
She makes me feel better when I'm feelin' bad  
Heaven is a girl that makes dreams come true  
Oh, no one does it good like heaven do, no  
  
She got the rhythm to drive me crazy  
She got the rhythm of love  
  
She said leave your name  
At the sound of the tone  
The lights are out  
But there's somebody home  
Better watch out when  
We're all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heaven is a girl that I've got to have  
She makes me feel good when I feel like hell  
Heaven is a girl she makes dreams come true  
And no one does it good like heaven do  
That voodoo that you do

Look out!  
Mama let me out on a Saturday night, she said now  
Go out and get her go and hold her tight  
I said now Mama, you don't understand

And if I hold her too long  
You never can tell what'll happen to me  
I wouldn't want you to see  
  
Look out

Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer  
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Look out!  
  
She's like a live bomb shell  
Like a flash out of hell  
And when she's shaking her ooh  
Everyone fell at her feet  
And that's neat and she took me completely  
By surprise with her ultra sonic eyes  
That were flashing like hysterical danger signs  
That said beware where you tread  
Or you'll go out of your head  
  
Look out  
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer  
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
She's a hell raiser, star chaser, trail blazer  
Natural born raver, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Look out!  
  
Hell raiser, hell raiser, hell raiser  
Hell raiser, hell raiser, ooh  
Now Mama, you don't understand  
Ev'ry time I touch her hand  
It's like I'm burning in the fires of hell  
And if I hold her too long  
You never can tell what'll happen to me  
I wouldn't want you to see

I gotta know tonight  
If you're alone tonight  
Can't stop this feeling  
Can't stop this fire  
  
Oh, I get hysterical, hysteria  
Oh can you feel it, do you believe it?  
It's such a magical mysteria  
When you get that feelin', better start believin'  
Cause it's a miracle, oh say you will  
Ooh babe  
Hysteria when you're near  
Come on

Was it something I did  
Was it something I said  
Was the vision you had  
Just a voice in your head  
Can you run through the flames  
Can you see through the haze  
Is this the end of your world  
Or just one of your days  
  
I've yet to taste it on my tongue  
I get so dangerous on my own  
  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
  
Would you call it untrue  
Would you call it a sin  
With the burden of proof  
Breathing under my skin  
Like a ghost from the past  
I'm the face in the crowd  
And the name that you scream  
When you're dreaming out loud  
  
I've yet to taste it on my tongue  
I get so dangerous on my own  
  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
  
I've yet to taste it on my tongue  
I get so dangerous on my own  
  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, the one you need  
The love you crave, the mouth you feed  
The more you give, the more I take  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake  
I am your child, I could be your last mistake

Baby you excite

'cause a little too much  
Could never be enough, now

Who's the one to knock me over?  
Who's the one to take me by surprise?  
Who's the one who's out to get me?  
Who will share my fantasy tonight?  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be anyone  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be you, it could be anyone  
Do you really know the story?  
Have you really come to see the band?  
Can you reach out for the glory?  
Can you feel the nearness of my hand?  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be anyone  
If you look a little harder  
You can see we're really all the same  
And if you look a little deeper  
Can't you see it's really all a game?  
It could be you, instead of me  
It could be anyone  
It could be you, it could be me  
It could be you, it could be anyone  

Now in your big flash motor and your wild reputation  
You're ready to hit the streets  
Winking at the boys, yeah heading for the noise  
Got the world at your feet  
  
If leaving me for dead with a pistol at my head  
Is your idea of how I'd feel  
Well, let me tell you honey before you spend all of your money  
I got my hands firmly on the wheel, yeah  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
Backstreet lover in the cold of the evening  
Takes you to a place he knows  
Says it will be fine, better make up your mind  
You've cut it deep and now it shows  
  
It's way past midnight and you travel through the city  
You wonder what you should do  
Baby can't you see that you've had enough of me  
And I've certainly had enough of you, oh  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
It don't matter to me  
  
It doesn't matter  
It doesn't matter  
It doesn't matter

Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
If you could feel what I feel  
If I could make you see  
If you could need like I need  
I'd be the air that you breathe  
  
You go straight to my head as I lie in my bed  
I just can't win  
I can't help the state I'm in  
  
It's only love so why is falling in it  
The one thing that you can't do  
It's only love then why am I hurting from it  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
Na na na na na na na na na  
  
If you could share my wildest thoughts  
Meet me in my mind  
If you could want the way that I want  
You'd want me all the time  
  
You go straight to my head when I lie in my bed  
I just can't win  
I can't stop the state I'm in  
  
It's only love so why is falling in it  
The one thing that you can't do  
It's only love then why am I hurting from it  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
  
Every dream I dream has got you in  
And every minute with you means everything  
I wanna take you there where you've never been  
In my dreams  
  
You go straight to my head as I lie in my bed  
I just can't win  
I can't help the state I'm in  
  
It's only love so why is falling in it  
The one thing that you can't do  
It's only love so why am I hurting from it  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
  
Na na na na na na na na na  
It's only love if you're hurting too  
Na na na na na na na na na  
It's only love if you're hurting too

Cold nights, dark days  
Love moves in mysterious ways  
It's so sweet like a mother's tongue  
Whose symphony protects her young  
  
But this truth ain't what it seems  
'Cause you and I have different dreams  
You rise up but you never learn  
As we try to shake this sleep that burns  
  
The darkness screams its icy breath  
As daylight dies a thousand deaths  
  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution  
  
Reach out to the past  
We blame the victim first and last  
Blind faith got you and me  
Running like a refugee  
We fall out and into the street  
To wash the blood out of the sheets  
And your pain, it flows like wine  
As my subconscious reaps your mind  
  
I stretch to kiss the burning sky  
And watch the waking beauty cry  
  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution  
  
Is it such a crime to watch the sunset for the last time  
Until we meet again, goodbye, farewell, amen  
  
Cold nights, dark days  
Love moves in mysterious ways  
We rise up but you'll never learn  
As we try to shake this sleep that burns  
  
The darkness screams its icy breath  
As daylight dies a thousand deaths  
  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution  
Kings of oblivion, deadly and divine solution  
Kings of oblivion, welcome to my revolution

These are the days we throw away  
The words we never say  
That I'm so fragile and so wrong  
And we're still knockin' on the door  
Of a world that's gone before  
Until the real thing comes along  
Kiss the day on it's way  
And the sun will never shine  
In your eyes like the skies  
And the darkness will arise  
Kiss the day and await  
It holds you in it's arms  
And the light will never fade  
Kiss the day  
And now I've seen enough to know  
Though the truth can leave you cold  
It can always lead you home  
Back to the place where we belong  
To the time when we were strong  
When we could blow away the storm  
Kiss the day on it's way  
And the sun will never shine  
In your eyes like the skies  
And the darkness will arise  
Kiss the day and await  
It holds you in it's arms  
And the light will never fade  
Kiss the day, kiss the day  
These are the days we throw away  
The words we never say  
Till the real thing comes along  
Kiss the day on it's way  
And the sun will never shine  
In your eyes like the skies  
And the darkness will arise  
Kiss the day and await  
It holds you in it's arms  
And the light will never fade  
Kiss the day  

Cool woman, cool eyes, you got me hypnotized  
So head down, get a rhythm  
Stop your stalling and your bitching  
I'm rock steady, I'm still shaking  
I'm ready for the taking  
So make your move, yeah, make me  
And get ready for the big "see"

Slow down, hold on  
You're too fast, you're too strong  
Take it easy, take it slow  
Make it last, don't let go  
We're one body, it's one way  
You're not leaving, c'mon stay  
So get down on your knees  
And let me know you're eager to please  
  
Let it rock, yeah  
Let it roll, let it  
Let it go, let it go  
You gotta let it rock, come on  
Let it roll, yeah just let it go  
  
Let it go  
Let it go  
Let it go  
  
Cool woman, cool eyes  
You got me hypnotized  
Slow down, hold on  
You're too fast, too strong  
I need a woman, a woman to love  
One good woman  
And you got what I want, what I want  
  
Slow down, hold on  
You're much too fast, you're much too strong  
Take it slow, make it last  
Take it easy, not too fast  
Don't let go  
  
No, I'm rock steady, but still shaking  
No, I'm rock steady, but still shaking  
And I'm ready for the taking  
So make your move, yeah make me  
And get a-ready for the big "see", yeah  
  
Let it rock, let it

Let it, let it roll  
Let it, let it go  
Let it go  
  
Let it rock, yeah  
Let it roll, let it  
Let it go, let it go  
You gotta let it rock, come on  
Let it roll, yeah  
Let it go

Something in the way you move  
Let's me get too close to you  
I tremble when I look at your face  
And I want all the world to see  
Tonight the world belongs to me  
Touch me with your animal grace  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
And feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
  
Burnin' in the afterglow  
We catch the wind and let it go  
Washed away like words in the sand  
A passion that's so physical  
Electric and untouchable  
Don't want to let it slip through my hands  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
And feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
  
Don't let this dream pass by  
Just spread your wings and fly  
Reach out and touch  
Let your heart just breathe me in  
I'll be your oxygen  
  
Put your hand on my heart  
Feel the need in me  
  
Let me be the one  
Lead me into temptation  
And show me the right side of wrong  
Let me be the one  
Take me in from the cold  
Gimme something to hold  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
Oh, oh  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one

I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Well in my mind  
It's easy  
To lose sight of the truth  
But in my heart  
I can't deny  
My feeling inside  
  
'Cos I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Man in the sky  
You say you are flying  
To lose sight of the world  
You wanna stay high  
Then don't deny  
Your feeling inside  
  
'Cos I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh oh oh  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
Yeahh!  
Whooo!  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Oh!  
Has gotta come your way.  
  
I believe  
If you give  
A little bit of love  
To those you live with  
A little bit of love  
Whooooo  
Has gotta come your way

You held my hand and then you slipped away  
And I may never see your face again  
So tell me how to fill the emptiness inside  
Without love, what is life?  
And anyone who knew us both can see  
We always were the better part of me  
I never wanted to be this free  
And all this pain, when does it go away?  
  
Then every time I turn around  
And you're nowhere to be found  
I know  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
Oh, I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye  
To all I ever knew, to you  
To you  
  
From memory there is no hiding place  
Turn on the TV and I see you there  
In every crowd there's always someone with your face  
Everywhere, trying not to care  
  
Then every time I turn around  
And you're nowhere to be found  
I know  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
I gotta long long way I know  
Before I can say goodbye  
To all I ever knew  
  
To you I wish you everything  
And all the best that life can bring  
I only hope you think of me sometimes  
Oh, and even though I feel the pain  
I know that I will love again  
The time will come  
Oh, and I'll move on  
  
I gotta long long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye to you  
Oh, I gotta long long way I know  
Gotta long way to go  
Before I can say goodbye  
Before I say goodbye  
To all I ever knew  
To all I ever knew  
I gotta long way to go  
Before I say  
Say goodbye, say goodbye  
But I wish you the best girl  
Oh and all of the rest to you

Love, love look what you've done to my heart  
Oh I should've known from the start  
That, you'd go and tear it apart  
Oh and now you've deserted me  
  
You never lose, you never fail  
You always live to tell the tale  
You take me up, you bring me down  
Without a touch, without a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
Love, love why do I keep searching high and low?  
You take me in your arms and let me go  
  
Oh how long must it be until you, come run back to me can't you see  
I got no release from the pain just to see you again  
  
You never lose, you never fail  
You always live to tell the tale  
You take me up, you bring me down  
Without a touch, without a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love, love, let me go  
  
When will love set me free?  
When will you come back to me?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh love

If you've got love in your sights  
Watch out, love bites  
When you make love, do you look in your mirror?  
Who do you think of?  
Does he look like me?  
Do you tell lies?  
And say that it's forever?  
Do you think twice, or just touch 'n' see?  
Ooh babe  
Ooh yeah  
When you're alone, do you let go?  
Are you wild 'n' willing or is it just for show?  
Ooh come on  
  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy  
I know you think that love is the way you make it  
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it  
No!  
  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
It's no surprise  
(Love begs, love pleads)  
  
It's what I need  
When I'm with you are you somewhere else?  
Am I getting through or do you please yourself?  
When you wake up will you walk out?  
It can't be love if you throw it about  
Ooh babe  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy  
Oh  
  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
It's no surprise  
(Love begs, love pleads)  
It's what I need  
Ooh yeah  
  
I don't want to touch you too much baby  
Cause making love to you might drive me crazy  
I know you think that love is the way you make it  
So I don't want to be there when you decide to break it  
No!  
  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
(Love bites, love bleeds)  
It's bringing me to my knees  
(Love lives, love dies)  
It's no surprise  
(Love begs, love pleads)  
It's what I need  
If you've got love in your sights  
Watch out, love bites  
Yes it does  
It will be hell

Time  
Just watching the time slippin' away  
Gimme a sign  
Where do you go when you can't find the way  
  
So we watch and we wait  
And we crawl and we kneel  
If you know who you are  
Then you know how to feel  
In time  
Maybe temptation is all that you need  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
It's not as easy as it seems  
When you can't even sleep in your dreams  
Love don't lie  
And that's the truth  
Look me straight in the eye for the proof  
That love don't lie  
Yeah, love don't lie  
  
Out in the cold  
With a love that burns like the sun  
You've stolen my soul  
So justice would seem to be done  
  
So we hope and we pray  
And we live and we learn  
If we know where we are  
Then we know where to turn  
In time  
Maybe persuasion is all that you need  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
It's not as easy as it seems  
When you can't even sleep in your dreams  
Love don't lie  
And that's the truth  
Look me straight in the eye for the proof  
That love don't lie  
  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
It's stronger than steel  
It's got the heart and emotion to heal  
Love don't lie  
It lifts you up  
Takes you higher when high ain't enough  
Love don't lie  
And that's the truth  
Look me straight in the eye  
Straight in the eye for the proof  
Love don't lie  
Yeah love don't lie  
Oh, oh  
Love don't lie  
Yeah love don't lie

Well I'm down in the alley of Sally and I'm feeling my way  
And it's four in the morning, I don't have a lot I can say  
I know I'm looking for some satisfaction  
But there ain't much news  
Got some walking from a back reaction  
I'm hanging down and loose  
  
Me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is I'm doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now my brain and my body are runnin' on different rails  
And I died and just say hi what if all else fails  
Oh I woke up in a subway station  
Lying half dead on the floor  
I don't remember anything  
What happened the night before  
  
Oh me and the boys have been drinking  
Feeling like this is the wrong time for thinking  
All I can say is I'm doing fine with just me and my wine  
  
Now listen  
My hair's a real mess, I feel and look like a joke  
And there's a hole in my jeans, I just ran right out of smokes  
You know I'd like to get to know you  
But I ain't got the time  
I'm finding it harder and harder  
To make this damn thing rhyme  
  
Just me and my wine  
Well just me and my wine  
You know that I'm doing fine  
Well just me and my wine  
Thank you

The sun that is rising is glistening down on the hill  
The pool of confusion is silently still  
The thoughts of another keep runnin' through my mind  
As I search for the answer, it's never easy to find  
  
The prophet stood on the hill and firmly he gripped his sword  
As the angels of wisdom were singing a heavenly chord  
So I look back and wonder if I should be asking for more  
As a traveller in limbo who's washed up onto the wrong shore  
  
In the morning when I wake up  
And the story starts to break up  
Then it's plain to see  
What's wrong with me  
So the curtains they are drawn back  
And my mind is simply torn back  
To reality, you see, to me, I'm just a misty dreamer  
  
I slipped by the waterslide  
And I thought I heard my true love screamin'  
So I opened my eyes and shook my head  
And I realized I was only dreamin'  
  
So close your eyes and drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you  
  
Your conscience guided by a light  
Your memory won't be here tonight  
The sorrow that eyes are showing  
Doesn't hide your spirit flowing  
  
So close your eyes and drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you  
  
Drift away  
Tomorrow seems like yesterday for you

She was a foxy rocker, a roxy roller  
An unchained sex machine  
Slippin' slidin', electric glidin'  
And boy she was mean  
I said mean  
High class dealer, sippin' her tequila  
Comin' on pretty strong  
Real love stealer, rebel rousin' squealer  
She said go but I said no  
  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
  
Waiting at the back door, couldn't take it anymore  
Didn't know where she'd been  
She looked pretty neat, turnin' on the heat and only seventeen  
Seventeen  
Windin' her up, bringin' her down, she wanted it just the same  
Said stick around  
That's when I found I only had myself to blame  
  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I kept saying no, no no no no no  
  
High class dealer, sippin' on tequila  
Comin' on really strong  
Rhythm stealer, rattle off squealer  
She said go but I said no  
  
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no  
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no  
Well I kept saying no, no no no no no  
I say no no no  
I say no no no  
I say no no  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No  
No

I want to know you better  
Let's spend some time together  
I'm gonna be what's on your mind  
  
Look in my eye's they're calling  
I need your love to fall in  
If you could just give me a sign  
  
I can't get over baby  
I can't get over now  
I can't get over this feeling, I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
Now,right now  
It's the fire inside you  
Feels like I feel  
NOW,right now  
Deep inside me  
Deep inside me  
  
I'm tired of make believin', I'm lost and barely breathin'  
I'm on the ceiling help me down, yeah  
I'll be the risk your takin'  
And I won't rest until your mine, oh  
  
I want to show you baby  
I want to show you now  
I want to tell you this feeling I feel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't get over this feeling I feel right now  
Yeah.  
Now,right now  
Let the fire inside you  
Burn like I burn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Deep inside  
Deep inside me  
Deep inside me  
Deep inside

The wait is done, the battle's won  
So count the cost before you run  
Cause on and on your time was power  
The clock on the wall ticks away the hours  
Come on down, you're flyin' high  
You'll never win if you never try  
Stop the hate and carry the load  
Come on, get this show on the road  
  
On through the night, you can't stop me now  
On through the night, you won't stop me anyhow  
  
The stakes are high and gettin' higher  
I'm flat on my face and you call me liar  
I'm watching you, you're watching me  
You're watching every move that I can see  
My reputation's still at stake  
I play it safe for safety's sake  
Your ego and your promises  
Are gonna fade again and again  
  
On through the night, you won't stop me now  
On through the night, you won't stop me anyhow  
Not anyhow  
  
All you want to hear is the audience applause  
You can't get on stage for a country clause  
And the road ahead seems a little rough  
If you want to know my feelings I'd say that's tough  
And that's tough  
  
Your wheels ain't turnin', you're out of gas  
You pay by check but they take cash  
Two roads ahead but which to take  
And you can't see it's your mistake  
They're waitin' for you  
They're waitin' for me  
And what seems like eternity  
It's all tradition, it'll get you yet  
In rock'n'roll there's no safety net  
  
On through the night, you can't stop me now  
On through the night, you can't stop me anyhow  
On through the night, goin' on and on, on and on  
On through the night, you can't stop me anyhow  
No no not anyhow

Ahh,  
I feel my spirit fly, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
I, I kiss the world good-bye, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Night, with the city lights, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Run like a runaway, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
  
Won't you disappear  
Into midnight again  
  
Why don't you come  
Why won't you come  
Why don't you fly fly fly with me  
Sweet innocent fate will be our company  
  
Ahh, Ahhh, Ahh, Ahhh  
We at the plant remain, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Moon, simple as can be, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh,  
It's wrong to feel so free, only after dark  
Ahh, Ahhh  
Only you do it to me, only after dark

And with this message  
That I bring to you  
A beacon of light  
To see you through  
For time is on our side  
And a holy man  
Does say to me  
To always to be blind  
And never to see  
It's not the way he planned it  
Oh no  
  
The time has come to gather up your thoughts  
For you have said your piece  
The lords of light will change this land  
From famine into feast  
The buildings that once stood tall  
Have crumbled to the ground  
The silver warriors who came in force  
Are nowhere to be found  
  
Time is the essence the priests do say  
To restore your faith in man  
For the job you do and the role you play  
Will help rebuild this land  
Through empty streets and dusty fields  
We'll fight for what we need  
Protected by our swords and shields  
We can replant the seed  
  
The roads ahead are long and winding  
On which the bandits thrive  
But we have the power of finding  
Illusion to keep us alive  
So through the valleys and over the hills  
We'll march and sing in rhyme  
We'll fight until we lose our will  
For essence is our time  
  
The sun the moon  
The darkened sky  
The morning dew  
Reflecting in my eye  
The rising mist  
The dampened earth  
Are just reminders of what life's worth  
Whoah yeah  
Whoah yeah  
Whoah yeah  
  
And with this message  
That I bring to you  
A beacon of light  
To see you through  
For time is on our side  
For time is the essence  

Does it hurt to remember  
Does it help to forget  
Do you know what you started  
When you lit the fuse of regret  
  
There's not a reason why you've come undone  
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on  
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land  
  
Cause you're living on a paper sun  
Blind to all the damage done  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the tide to turn  
Living on a paper sun  
You can't hide and you can't run  
All your dreams have come and gone  
Living on a paper sun  
  
Do you still hear 'em screamin'  
And does the fear make you run  
Is the anger inside of you  
A gift from father to son  
  
I don't believe in you, you've come undone  
I don't believe in what you do, this can't go on  
I don't believe in you as I walk this broken land  
  
Cause you're living on a paper sun  
Blind to all the damage done  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the tide to turn  
Living on a paper sun  
You can't hide and you can't run  
All your dreams have come and gone  
Living on a paper  
  
You will discover the way to suffer  
And like no other you feed the fire  
  
There's not a reason why you've come undone  
There's nothing left to justify, this can't go on  
There's nothing left inside as I walk this broken land  
  
Cause you're living on a paper sun  
Blind to all the damage done  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the tide to turn  
Living on a paper sun  
Waiting for the night  
All your dreams have come and gone

I'm out a luck, out a love  
Gotta photograph, picture of  
Passion killer, you're too much  
You're the only one I want to touch  
I see your face every time I dream  
On every page, every magazine  
So wild and free so far from me  
You're all I want, my fantasy  
  
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown  
Oh oh, look what you've done

Put your hurt on me, if you dare  
Such a woman, you got style  
You make every man feel like a child, oh  
You got some kinda hold on me  
You're all wrapped up in mystery  
So wild so free and far from me  
You're all I want, my fantasy  
  
Oh, look what you've done to this rock 'n' roll clown  
Oh oh, look what you've done

Photograph I'm out a love  
Photograph I'm out a love  
Photograph you're the only one  
Photograph I want to touch

Last night I was blown away  
I said a million things I'd never say  
I was knocked right down, it got to me  
Gonna get me some of your chemistry  
  
You want me to promise you  
That everything is true  
  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
I won't make promises that I don't mean  
I'll even mean the things I tell you in my sleep, yeah

You want me to promise you  
That everything is true

I'll even mean the things I whisper in my sleep  
Oh, let me tell you  
I won't say a single thing darling, that you can't believe  
You gotta believe me  
  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
Oh baby believe me now  
I won't make promises that I don't mean  
Oh why won't you believe me now  
I'll even mean the things I whisper in my sleep, yeah  
I won't make promises that I can't keep  
Baby, you gotta believe me

Down to the ground  
Heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh heh

Well I came down here from manhattan  
To see the lights on the mall  
But when I got here early this morning  
Well I couldn't see any at all  
So I walked a little further  
And much to my surprise  
There was a hot cool woman  
In a chevy staring into my eyes  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
Alright  
She said now don't walk any further  
Just jump into my car  
And we can head on down the highway  
But you'd better not go too far  
Cause my daddy he's big business  
So we've gotta be back by tonight  
But we can still have some fun now  
If we head on downtown to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
Well, we ended up in this cafe  
'Bout twenty-five minutes to one  
See, she took me to this nightclub  
And the music went on and on  
Well we were set down to get coffee  
When in walked her old man  
No matter how we tried to explain it well  
We couldn't make him understand  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights  
I've just got to see the lights

Sittin' dark getting taken 'cause I said  
Something lewd in a low down accent  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Kinda love those eyes  
I wanna get down honey  
But I ain't your guy  
  
I'll rap 'n' ruck 'n' jam it up  
But count me out  
Cause all I ever wanna get is slang  
  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is slang  
  
What's affectin' my condition  
What's about to knock you down  
Said wrapped 'n' bound and a goddamn  
I'd love to get connected but it's outta my hand  
  
I'll rap 'n' ruck 'n' jam it up  
But count me out  
Cause all I ever wanna get is slang  
  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is slang  
  
It's my intention to be your obsession  
(Mi pasion, mi obsesion, queria que eastuvieras conmigo)  
It's my obsession to be your addiction  
  
Uno, dos, tres, cuatro  
  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
Slang with me, I just wanna get soakin' wet  
Slang with me, I don't wanna get my hands dirty  
All I ever wanna get is slang

You're always pretending to be  
Someone who prefers to be free  
You think you can fool me with your lyin' eyes  
But what is this game that you play  
When all that your trying to say  
Is that your lonely, in need of a friend  
  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
And can't you see that it's true  
There's someone as lonely as you  
Trying so hard, so hard to get through  
And why can't everyone see the way that it really should be  
Why hide your feelings and suffer the pain  
  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do  
  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
You know she'll make you feel sad  
You know that sorrow is a woman  
  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, I just can't seem to get to you  
Oh yeah, sorrow woman, if only you could see you as I do

I said welcome to my show  
It's just a-you and me baby  
We got the whole damn night to go  
  
You're holding out on me, while I'm on fire  
If you can't stand the heat, then you should try  
Victim of my vices, you know you are  
You skate on ice to paradise, stairway to the stars  
  
Stagefright all night, won't you let go  
All night stagefright, on with the show  
  
You come on like a lady dressed to kill  
Never thought you could be caught, but you will  
A little understanding, a little love  
A headline act around the back, is what I'm thinkin' of  
  
Stagefright all night, won't you let go  
All night stagefright, on with the show  
Stagefright all night, you're dream starts today  
All night stagefright, is only a heartbeat away  
  
You're going for my head, you're going down  
Gettin' good at being bad, you're hangin' round  
A fun inspired asylum, toys for the boys  
Love on the rocks, forget-me-nots, you got no choice  
  
Stagefright all night, oh won't you let go  
All night stagefright, get on with the show  
Stagefright all night, you're dream starts today  
All night stagefright, is only a heartbeat away  
  
Stagefright all night, oh won't you let go  
All night stagefright, get on with the show

I got to know right now  
It's got to be this time  
I wanna show you how  
Gonna make you change your mind  
There's an empty chair at my table  
There's an empty look in your eyes  
Ooh, that's right  
  
I just happen to be a man  
And you happen to be a woman  
And we happen to be together  
Try to stop this thing comin'  
  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take a little love and shake it all around, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground  
Down to the ground, baby come on  
Stand up, stand up for love  
  
I'm gonna play your game  
I wanna play with fire  
I want to breathe your air  
Baby, gonna take you there  
If you lay your cards on the table  
I'll lay my love on the line  
Till you're mine  
  
I just happen to be a man  
And you happen to be a woman  
And we happen to be together  
Try to stop this thing comin'  
  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take a little love and shake it all around, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground  
Down to the ground, baby come on  
Stand up, stand up for love  
  
You couldn't get it much better  
You never had it so good  
Stand up together  
And when you're ready to  
You're gonna get what you should  
  
Little by little  
Like a fine wine  
My love is like a motor  
Runnin' all the time  
Step by step  
Easy and slow  
On the stairway to heaven  
What a way to go  
  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take a little love and shake it all around, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and throw me to the ground, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Take me in your arms and show me what you found, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
My love is like a motor runnin' all the time, stand up  
Stand up, yeah, kick love into motion  
I said step by step  
Go easy, go slow, stand up  
Stand up, kick love into motion  
Yeah, on a stairway to heaven  
What a way to go, stand up

[Originally by The Faces]  
  
In the mornin' don't say you love me,  
'Cause I'll only kick you out of the door  
I know your name is Rita 'cause your perfume's smellin' sweeter  
Since when I saw you down on the floor.  
  
Won't need too much pursuadin'  
I don't mean to sound degradin',  
But with a face like that you got nothin' to laugh about.  
Red lips, hair and fingernails,  
I hear you're a mean old Jezebel  
Lets go up stairs and read my Tarot cards  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd better stay with me  
  
So, in the mornin', please don't say you love me  
'Cause you know I'll only kick you out the door  
Yeah, I'll pay your cab fare home, you can even use my best cologne,  
Just don't be here in the mornin' when I wake up  
  
Stay with me, stay with me  
For tonight you'd gonna stay with me  
Sit down, get up, get out.

I know you don't believe it  
Like I believe it  
Oh no, it's not your fault  
You sit alone inside a room  
Wait for the world to come to you  
They never do  
  
It must be something that you can't let go  
It hurts that you won't let me know  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And then in conversation  
I love the way you mention  
Nothing's ever gone your way  
With a hammer in your hand  
You spell out a master plan  
We never learn  
  
It must be somebody holding your heart  
Something that tears us apart  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
I hold on to this moment  
Any time is right to be alive  
  
And I don't think that it's right  
To let love pass by  
Any time of life  
It's good to be alive  
  
Every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help to be myself  
Yes, every time you want to  
Any time I touch you  
I can't help what I feel  
But it sure feels real  
I wanna hold on to this moment  
Cause babe it sure feels right  
To be alive  
To be alive  
To be alive

I'm here to testify  
I can't remember why  
Complete or justify my situation.  
  
I don't remember when and I can only half pretend,  
A case of now and then, I just need someone.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way but there?s the only way, lead the way.  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna take a ride, I wanna kiss the sky  
I just found out, I cant wait until tomorrow comes.  
  
Spoke out on compromise, just the ego telling lies.  
Confides and then defies, in case you?'re waiting.  
Guess that it's a time for change  
Remain but change the name.  
This game is where to aim.  
I hear the charge, boy.  
  
No solution, there's a saner revolution,  
there's no better way, but there?s the only way, lead the way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's liberating, but when it rains it pours,  
Degenerating, ain't gonna fight no more.  
  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna break down, I'm gonna shake down  
I just discovered, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.  
I wanna take a ride, I wanna kiss the sky  
I just found out, I can't wait until tomorrow comes.

Somewhere in the distance I hear the bells ring  
Darkness settles on the town as the children start to sing  
And the lady 'cross the street she shuts out the night  
There's a cast of thousands waiting  
As she turns out the light  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
London boys are gazing as the girls go hand in hand  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtains start to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
With a pocket full of innocence, their entrance is grand  
And the queen of the dream stands before them all  
She stretches out her hand as the curtain starts to fall  
  
But it's too late, too late, too late  
Too late for love  
Yes it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
  
Standing by the trapdoor aware of me and you  
Are the actor and the clown they're waiting for their cue  
And there's a lady over there she's acting pretty cool  
But when it comes to playing life  
She always plays the fool  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love  
  
Is it all too late  
Much too late  
Can't you see it's all too late  
It's too late  
  
But it's too late, too late, it's too late  
Too late for love  
It's too late, it's too late, too late  
Too late for love

I don't want to fall in love  
But it's been taken out of my hands  
And right now I realize  
I don't want to say goodbye  
  
I miss you more than words can say  
They never turn out right  
But here goes anyway  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere  
But I know you're out there somewhere  
These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds  
  
I can't help the way I feel  
But somethin's got a hold of my heart  
It hurts that I can't let go  
Now I just want to let you know  
  
I need you more than words can say  
They never turn out right  
But here goes anyway  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere  
But I know you're out there somewhere  
These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds  
  
If I ever get myself together  
And it takes whatever it takes  
To get myself back to you  
  
Everyday I miss your touch  
Never thought it would mean so much  
All the words I could have said  
Got me reelin' torn to shreds  
Every road I go is nowhere  
But I know you're out there somewhere  
These voices in my head  
Got me feelin' torn to shreds

The concentration drifts in out of me  
Conversation slides away  
Turn and face the change in apathy  
Take a rise to fall  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust  
  
Slave or sympathy, it atrophies  
Save but ancient hearts  
Hiding scars and knives in symphonies  
Still we rise to fall  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust  
  
Won't you save? Don't you blame me?  
I got the feel that I'm gone, turn to dust  
Sentence, rape me, segregate me  
I got the fear that I'm gone, turn to dust

Walk away if you want to  
It's OK, if you need to  
You can run, but you can never hide  
From the shadow that's creeping up beside you  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you can't have it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
(Whatever you do)  
I'll be two steps behind you  
(Wherever you go)  
And I'll be there to remind you  
That it only takes a minute of your precious time  
To turn around and I'll be two steps behind  
  
Take the time  
To think about it  
Walk the line, you know you just can't fight it  
Take a look around and see what you can find  
Like the fire that's burning up inside me  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you can't have it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a magic running through your soul  
But you, you can't have it all  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Two steps behind  
Yeah, baby  
Two steps behind  
Ohh, sugar  
Two steps behind.

Hey, ahh  
Ahh, yea yeah  
  
Had your name all tattooed on my heart  
It's gone, how could this be wrong  
It's unbelievable, unbelievable  
Just the picture of me  
Left out in this Hollywood Babylon  
Was unbelievable, unbelievable  
  
So let my greatest fear walk out the door, ahh  
This ain't what we're fighting for, ahh  
  
You don't say that it's over, over  
Never thought this could die  
But you speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
It's unbelievable  
  
Girl, I picture how the ghost of you  
Would follow me everywhere  
It's undeniable, unbelievable  
If I couldn't feel your velvet lips  
Your fingers run through my hair  
It's inconceivable, unbelievable  
  
So let my greatest fear walk out the door, ahh  
This ain't what we're fighting for  
  
You don't say that it's over, over  
Ahh, never thought this could die  
But you speak without words  
Speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
  
Did you really think about it  
What we could be missing  
I found it so hard to believe, yeah  
Unbelievable, it's unbelievable, yeah  
  
You don't say that it's over, over  
Ahh, never thought this could die  
But you speak without words  
Speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
  
You don't say that it's over, over, yeah  
Ahhh, never thought this could die  
Oh but you speak without words  
Speak without words  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
Making me feel so damn good, 'bye  
Unbelievable, yeah, unbelievable

(Shout)  
(Shout)  
Look in these eyes  
These eyes don't lie  
And they say that if you don't blink,  
Then you don't die.  
  
Now feel this heart  
It beats so tough  
And if you ever gonna doubt my faith  
Then I'll call your bluff  
Cause you ain't that tough  
  
The lies in your eyes can't defeat me  
I ain't ever goin' down  
I was down on my knees completely  
And you will never take my crown  
But I rise from my feet you can't beat me

I hear your words.  
But there ain't nothing you can say to me

These cuts run deep  
Close to the bone  
But I gotta keep getting up  
Cause I been down so long  
So let's get it on  
  
The lies in your eyes can't defeat me  
I ain't ever goin' down

Warchild, your heart is broken  
Your mind is breakin', it's such a shame  
Warchild, your body's broken  
Your woman's taken, it's not a game  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory, shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams  
  
Warchild, I used to love you  
The whole world loved you, we used to care  
Warchild, your mind has been emptied  
So all you do now is just sit n' stare  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory, shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams  
  
Your lady's waiting, she's hesitating  
Not knowing why  
Warchild, the pain you're showing  
The pain is knowing that you're gonna die  
  
People once shared your wisdom  
Shared your memory, shared your dreams  
Now your thoughts have all been shattered  
What once was rhythm are now just screams

Well I've been lying awake all night just thinking of you  
But a bottle of whiskey lies heavy obstructing my view  
I've got a bottle of pills to give me my thrills  
And I know that I'm leading a life that kills  
  
(Wasted) I've wasted my time  
(Wasted) I'm shooting a line  
(Wasted) I'm stuck in a hole  
(Wasted) I'm losing control  
  
And I've been meaning to call, I've been wanting to phone  
You see I don't like the thought of leaving you here alone  
Well I've seen things down here that are fit for a queen  
I've seen things down here that should never be seen  
  
(Wasted) I've wasted my money  
(Wasted) I've wasted you honey  
(Wasted) I'm out of my brain  
(Wasted) I'm going insane  
  
I'm running in thin air  
There's nothingness everywhere  
I've gotta get out  
(Won't you help me?)  
I've gotta get out  
(Won't you help me?)  
I've gotta get out, oh won't you help me get out?  
  
I thought I saw you just the other day  
But it couldn't be you 'cos you had nothing to say  
'He's going away', they told all my friends  
Well now I'll be stuck in here til the misery ends  
  
(Wasted) I've wasted my time  
(Wasted) I'm shooting a line  
(Wasted) I'm out of my head  
(Wasted) I wish I was dead

Dirty old river, must you keep rolling  
Flowin' into the night  
People so busy, making me dizzy  
Taxi light shines so bright  
But I don't need no friends  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset  
I am in paradise  
Every day I look at the world from my window  
But chilly, chilly is the evening time  
Waterloo sunset's fine  
Waterloo sunset's fine  
  
Terry meets Julie at Waterloo Station  
Every Friday night  
But I am so lazy, I don't like to wander  
I stay at home at night  
But I don't feel afraid  
As long as I gaze on Waterloo sunset

On the first day of the first month in some distant year  
The whole sky froze golden  
Some said it was the aftermath of the radium bomb  
While the others told of a final retribution  
A terrible revenge of the Gods  
But we understood the grand finale  
Fulfillment of a prophecy told many years before  
So all that was left was  
All the women were captured and chained  
And national suicide was proclaimed  
And new America fell to the ground  
And all the children lay crippled lame  
But all the nations came together  
In fear of the thought of the end  
No more would we fight in the streets  
No courage had we to defend  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
A blinding light the sun had died a new moon took its place  
Tidal waves and open graves the fate of the unhuman race  
The city's heart no longer beats no pity have I left to lend  
A sinner sits reciting Dylan it's now that I welcome the end  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Everybody ran as they screamed at the sound  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
When the walls came tumbling down  
Nobody made a sound  
(Down, down, down)  
Down  

Could you ever steal a prayer to deny your God  
Could you ever buy your love and not count the cost  
Could you ever take a life when all was lost  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Could you bite the hand that feeds you and then ask for more  
Could you kiss the wound that bleeds spit it on the floor  
Could you open up your heart then close the door  
And would it ever be enough  
  
Every word you whisper  
All the tears you hide  
You die for love when it's alive  
But where does love go when it dies  
  
If you came across your dream would you walk on by  
Hold a candle to the wind and just let it die  
And is there room inside your mind for one more try  
And would it ever be enough  
  
I watch the time go rushing by it's like an ocean wave  
Showing you no mercy throwing dirt upon your grave  
You're drowning in the darkness and you're blinded by the light  
And there ain't no prayer that's gonna save you now  
  
If you woke up from your sleep blood on your hands  
Would you wash the pain away no one understands  
There must be someone out there who can help you breathe again  
And would it ever be enough

Driving off in the rain and snow  
Oh the jets ain't jumping cause the clouds too low  
I wanna know  
I wanna know  
I wanna know  
The ice on the window the highway the sea  
Who do you love is it him or is it me  
Hey hey I wanna know  
  
I called Detroit city on the telephone  
The man on the line tell me you ain't home  
I wanna know  
Who's that voice  
What's  
There's a deep red glow in the early morning sky  
Who do you love better make up your mind  
  
Don't wanna buy love  
Don't wanna try love  
I just want your love babe  
  
Hey alright  
  
Well its five in the morning and the place is dead  
I'm gonna rest my body on a empty bed  
Who do you love  
I gotta know  
What's his name baby  
What's your game  
Make up your mind are you his are you mine  
When you get back I ask you one more time  
Hey hey  
Hey hey

In the beginning God made the land  
Then He made the water and creatures, then He made man  
He was born with a passion, love and hate  
A restless spirit with a need for a mate  
But there was something that was missing, something lost  
So he came with the answer, here's what it cost  
One part love, one part wild  
One part lady, one part child  
  
I give you  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
  
And in the garden, lust began  
The animal instinct, the wanton man  
She fed him with a hunger, an appetite  
And fillin' with emotion he took a bite  
It was one part love, one part child  
One part lover, one part wild  
  
I give you  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
Women, women, lots of pretty women  
Men, men, they can't live without them  
  
Skin on skin, let the love begin  
Women  
  
It was one part love, one part wild  
One part lover, one part child  
A whole lotta fire, a little bit of ice  
A whole lotta something you can't sacrifice  
  
I give you  
Hair, eyes, skin on skin  
Legs, thighs  
What's that spell  
  
Women, women, oh, oh  
Women, women, callin' every girl  
Women, women, all around the world  
Women, women, oh we can't live without them  
Women, women

Day and night black and white  
You take it all for granted  
I'm the one who turns you on  
  
When you don't know where you belong  
And nothin' seems to matter  
I'm the one who's holding on  
  
It's alright to be wrong  
All we need's a little time  
But nothing here can last that long  
  
We show the world a brand new face  
It's taken us all this time  
All this time  
All of this doubt  
We get to work it out  
All of this doubt  
We get to work it out  
  
Yesterday lost your way  
Still looking for an answer  
I'm the one who holds the key  
  
When you don't know where you belong  
And nothing seems to matter  
I'll unlock this mystery  
  
All of this doubt  
Day and night, black and white  
Take it all for granted  
We get to work it out  
I'm the one who turns you on  
Turns you on, turns you on  
All of this doubt  
  
When you don't know where you belong  
And nothin' seems to matter  
We get to work it out  
I'm the one who's holdin' on  
Holdin' on, holdin' on

I saw her today at the reception  
A glass of wine in her hand  
I knew she was gonna meet her connection  
As at her feet was a footloose man  
  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You just might find  
You'll get what you need  
  
I went down to the demonstration  
To get my fair share of abuse  
Singing "we're gonna vent our frustrations"  
"And if we don't we're gonna blow a 50-amp fuse"  
  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
Well, you just might find  
You'll get what you need  
  
I went down to the Chelsea drugstore  
To get your prescription filled  
I was standing in line with Mister Jimmy  
And man, did he look pretty ill  
We decided that we would have a soda  
My favorite flavor, was cherry red  
I sung my song to Mister Jimmy  
And he said one word to me, and that was "dead"  
  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
No no, you can't always get what you want  
Oh, you can't always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
You just might find  
You'll get what you need  
  
I saw her today at the reception  
In her glass was a bleeding man  
She was practiced at the art of deception  
Well I could tell by her bloodstained hands  
Oh, yes I could  
  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
You can't always get what you want  
But if you try sometimes  
Yeah, you just might find  
You'll get what you need  
Oh sugar, you'll get what you need, yeah yeah yeah  
You'll get what you need, yeah yeah yeah  
You'll get what you need, yeah yeah yeah

Don't care too much for  
Your backstabbin' and side steppin'  
You're all sweet talk, you're all lust  
You're the kind yeah, I don't trust  
I gotta get out, step aside  
Before you damage my pride  
Let me through don't spoil my view  
I gotta get away, away from you  
  
Oh no no never thought I'd feel so low  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
But I ain't gonna hide  
And yesterday everything seemed okay  
Yeah you better run and hide away  
Oh you better hide  
  
You're out, out on the street  
But I'm back on my feet  
I might lose it, so get wise  
Stop your usin' and your lies  
Oh my friend don't stick around  
Your time is up, the chips are down  
Let me through don't spoil my view  
I gotta get away, away from you  
  
Oh no no never thought I'd feel so low  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
But I ain't gonna hide  
And yesterday everything seemed okay  
Yeah you better run and hide away  
Oh you better hide  
  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', runnin', runnin'  
  
Runnin' away  
Watch me run  
Runnin', runnin', runnin'  
  
Oh no no never thought I'd feel so low  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
But I ain't gonna hide  
And yesterday everything seemed okay  
Yeah you better run and hide away  
Oh you better hide  
  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin', you got me runnin'

You can't say no no more, you got me runnin'  
Get out the door, you got me runnin'  
You got me runnin'

Ziggy played guitar, jamming good with Weird and Gilly  
And The spiders from Mars, he played it left hand  
But made it too far  
Became the special man, then we were Ziggy's band  
  
Ziggy really sang, screwed up eyes and screwed down hairdo  
Like some cat from Japan, he could lick 'em by smiling  
He could leave 'em to hang  
Came on so loaded man, well hung and snow white tan  
  
So where were the spiders  
While the rats tried to break our balls  
Just the beer light to guide us  
So we bitched about his fans  
And should we crush his sweet hands, oh  
  
Ziggy played for time, jiving us that we were voodoo  
The kids were just crass, he was the nazz  
With God given ass  
He took it all too far but boy could he play guitar  
  
Making love with his ego  
Ziggy sucked up into his mind  
Like a leper messiah  
When the kids had killed the man  
I had to break up the band, oh  
  
Oh yeah, ooooooh  
Now, Ziggy played guitar
