I just want you around,  
I just want you around  
I just want you around,  
I just want you around  
  
Thought that I had lost you  
I could hardly make a sound  
When I thought I couldn't hold you  
Knew the world had let me down  
Should have took the time and told you  
You keep my feet on the ground  
I hope that you can hear me  
Cause I know it's not profound  
  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
  
When I thought I was without you  
I got used to being down  
Was my fault I used to doubt you  
But that ain't me next time around  
Please believe me when I tell you  
Cause all my words are bound  
This is my cross so let me bear it  
I was lost but now I am found, found, found  
  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
  
Took this love for granted  
Kept my feelings under ground  
Should have watered what I planted  
Should have known what I had found  
I'm not used to being lonely  
I don't like the way it sounds  
You're the only one I know yeah  
Who don't turn my upside down  
  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
I just want you around,  
I just need you around  
  
[Repeat to Fade]

Intro]  
Now I don't  
I used to love him  
Now I don't  
Now I don't  
  
As I look at what I've done  
The type of life that I've lived  
How many things I pray the father will forgive  
One situation involved a young man  
He was the ocean and I was the sand  
He stole my heart like a thief in the night  
Dulled my senses and blurred my sight  
  
1 - I used to love him but now I don't  
I used to love him but now I don't  
  
I chose the road of passion and pain  
Sacrificed too much and waited in vain  
Gave up my power ceased being queen  
Addicted to love yeah, like the drug of  
Drug of a fiend  
  
Torn and confused wasted and used  
Reached the crossroad which path would I choose  
Stuck and frustrated I waited, debated  
For something to happen that just wasn't fated  
Thought what I wanted was something I needed  
When mamma said no then I just should have heeded  
Misled I bled till the poison was gone  
And out of the darkness arrived the sweet dawn  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Father you saved me and showed me that life  
Was much more than being some foolish mans wife  
Showed me that love was respect and devotion  
Greater than planets and deeper than any oceans  
See, my soul was weary but now it's replenished  
Content because that part of my life is finished, oh yeah  
  
I see him sometimes and the look in his eye  
Is one of a man whose lost treasures untold  
But my heart is gold, see I took back my soul  
And totally let my creator control  
The life which was his to begin with  
  
Repeat 1 until fade

Undying love you've given to me  
Seen in me things I would never have seen  
I don't understand why you care so much  
It's all a mystery  
Time and time again I ask myself  
What I have done to deserve such wealth  
The price you paid  
I could never repay  
Your generosity  
Chorus:  
In wanting to save me  
In order to save the day  
Because of love you placed yourself  
In harm's way  
It's truly beyond me  
Left without a word to say  
What kind of love would place itself  
In harm's way?  
What kind of love would place itself  
In harm's way?  
  
When I was down you came and lifted me  
When I was bound, yes, you set me free  
Things that you do makes it clear to see  
It's all a master plan  
Oh, no greater love that I've come to know  
And when I refuse, you still love me so  
With open arms you came and rescued me  
And erased all the pain  
Yes all the pain  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
What kind of love would place itself  
And risk your life for love's sake?  
What kind of love just takes on all the blame?  
It seems to be so easy  
It hurts sometimes but you never let go  
You will to love in spite of all you know  
You know, you know  
  
[Chorus:]

OK. Oh no! not you!  
What are you doing here?  
Oh boy it's gonna be hard now  
Can we put him in the back?  
Robin, Robin, Robin  
  
I used to get dressed for you all,  
I don't do that no more, I'm sorry  
It's a new day, I don't have the energy  
  
Y'all like my jokes?  
  
OK so, ah, these are brand new songs, that a very few people have heard hm  
Very much about, you know, whatever, I been going trough and what I been  
Learning lot of her, wonderful life lessons, you know, that are easy to
combine  
But you're very blessed after you realize why you had to go trough what you
had  
To go trough, is it very important that you really listen to the words, you  
Know, and if you have a hard time to hear what I'm saying please raise your
hand  
You know, object, whatever, you guys ready in there? (All set) OK  
  
And I, you know, It's really interesting because I used to  
I used to be a performer,  
And I really don't consider myself a performer so much anymore,  
I'm really just, you know I'm sharing, you know,  
More or less the music that I've been giving,  
But if I stop, if I start, if I, you know,  
Feel like saying "baby, baby, baby" for,  
Eighteen bars, whatever, you know,  
I just I do that  
  
So you guys are cool? (Yeah!)  
OK I'm talking to people in my head too,  
It's alright though.. This is worth my "ape lope"  
I'm just gonna finish sucking on my Lazenger  
  
OK so this particular song is called Mr. Intentional  
"will see, we tune that now"  
This is  
One "ape lope"

Can I get some of that tea, some of that tea. I know I sound rhaspy but that's  
Hey, I used to go on tour ya know, and I'd be a prisoner, I used to be a  
Prisoner on tour cause I would go on tour and tour your'e supposed to enjoy
and  
Have a good time but I'd be this prisoner in the hotel you know drinkin' tea  
And ya know tellin' children ya know mommy has to sleep cause I wanted to  
Maintain this ya know emmaculate sounding voice, but that's not realistic, ya  
Know reality is sometimes I stay up late and this is what I sound like when I  
Wake up the next day, and ya know its a voice ya know and to me the the more I  
Uh focus less on myself the more I realize I can be used to spread a message,  
Because when I am I used to be so ya know oh my god if I sound ya know harsh  
And rhaspy I can't go out there, that's a lie ya know I just sound like a  
Singer with a lot of stuff in her throat.  
  
So, I told the people at MTV that they gotta like me better if not then people  
Are gonna keep on sayin' who's that boy on stage. Who's that little boy. OK,  
We're just finishing tune up, OK...

I'll tell you every single-We all have gifts, you know, and uh, like special
gifts. And there's this voice inside of us that says "don't do that," you
know, "Why you gonna get up there with that guitar? You're gonna like like a,
a hip hop folk singer. What are you, you know, what are you?..."  
(Laughter)  
And I really went through, I mean, I'm serious, I mean I can laugh about it
now, but it took a long time for me to understand that, you know, what I am is
what I am and I can't be afraid to, you know, to expose that to the public.
You know, always-get in trouble trying to make it, tryin' to dress it up, you
know what I'm sayin'? Just tired of that, you know. Just tired of that. Tired
of frontin', Tired of that... And until I find a group of people that are as
passionate about it as I am, I'll just roll alone until such time, you know.
It's all good, God is faithful. y'all still get to hear it, so, you know?
'Cause see that enemy he would tell me, you know "You don't have the 20 piece
band, you can't do nothin'." I said, "Yeah, sure... Keep talkin'." 'Cause
somebody's gonna, they gonna see me and they gonna know "Oh I, there's
somethin' that God's been tellin me to do. I can do it, too. I can do what I'm
supposed to be doin', I don't need an entourage. What do I need a crew for?"
That doesn't validate you. Okay, let's see. Mmmm...  
  

What becomes of little boys  
Who dreams are larger than life has ever shown them they should be  
What becomes of little boys  
Whose goals are bigger than anything in there reality  
What happens to young men  
Disappointed once again when they find out there not suppose to grow  
Do their lives become a lie  
Should they wither up and die  
When they find out they deserve more than they know  
  
And it's hard to be confused  
When you find out you been used as a sacrifice for other peoples gain  
And no matter what they say it's the same thing everyday  
And no one seems concerned about your pain  
  
What becomes of little boys  
Who make a little too much noise  
When their dreams have flown way beyond the clouds  
Would you rather see them silent  
Or would you rather see them violent  
Cause they never had a reason to be proud  
  
What becomes of little boys  
What becomes of little boys  
What becomes of little boys  
What becomes of little boys  
  
Yeah... yeah ... Yeah...yeah... Yeah...yeah...yeah..  
Young men...young men...young man...young men  
Yeah... yeah ... Yeah.... Yeah.... Yeah.... Yeah...yeah..

On my drum, on my drum  
Me and my drum  
Me and my drum  
Me and my drum  
Me and my drum  
On my drum, on my drum  
On my drum, on my drum

I used to do it for the love a long time ago  
And all I ever wanted was love  
I used to love without fear a long time ago  
And all I ever wanted was love  
Then somebody came around and tried to hurt me  
Tried to make me feel like I was unworthy  
Took a pure love and tried to make it dirty  
Truth was they never did deserve me  
No!  
  
I had to lose myself so I could love you better  
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could  
Love you better  
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself  
So I could love you better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And that's just the way it is'  
  
Couldn't tell me I was love when I needed it  
When, all I ever wanted was love.  
Should a told me just me because!  
I'm worth receiving it  
But all I ever wanted was love  
There's is something awkward about the selflessness it  
Takes to  
Give love and the good that it makes you!  
True love can never really forsake you  
But it took a little while just for me to see!  
  
I had to lose myself so I could love you better  
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could  
Love you better  
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself  
So I could love you better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And that's just the way it is'  
  
I had a paralyzing fear of facing failure  
And I couldn't love you perfectly with fear in my head  
So I peerlessly had to face the danger  
So I could come back and love you whole instead  
All of your soul I said!  
So I could make it better  
  
I had to lose myself so I could love you better  
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could  
Love you better  
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself  
So I could love you better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And that's just the way it is'  
  
be-Sec:  
And so it goes that I never meant to hurt you  
Couldn't stay but I never meant to desert you  
Whole lot a things I just had to work through  
Time to heal and restore myself worth too  
Confrontation of my fears and anxiety  
Cried a whole lot years I suffered quietly  
And though it may have taken years I can finally!  
Tell you that you were always on my mind!  
  
I had to lose myself so I could make it better  
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could  
Make it better  
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself  
So I could make it better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And that was just the way!  
  
Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did  
Great love to absorb all the misuse I did  
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.  
And I'd do it all again because for you I live  
  
Takes strength to absorb all the abuse I did  
Great love to absorb all the abuse I did  
Hey baby it's not an excuse I give.  
And I'd do it all again because for you I live  
  
I had to lose myself so I could make it better  
I had to lose myself, had to lose myself so I could  
Make it better  
Had to lose myself, had to lose myself  
So I could make it better  
Had to lose myself in love  
And that was just the way!  
And that was just the way it is'

It's funny how money change a situation  
Miscommunication leads to complication  
My emancipation don't fit your equation  
I was on the humble, you on every station  
Some wan' play young lauryn like she dumb  
But remember not a game new under the sun  
Everything you did has already been done  
I know all the tricks from bricks to kingston  
My ting done made your kingdom wan' run  
Now understand "l-boogie's" non-violent  
But if a thing test me, run for mi gun  
Can't take a threat to mi new born son  
L's been this way since creation  
A groupie call, you fall from temptation  
Now you want to ball over separation  
Tarnish my image in your conversation  
Who you gon' scrimmage, like you the champion?  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
Now, now how come your talk turn cold?  
Gain the whole world for the price of your soul  
Tryin' to grab hold of what you can't control  
Now you all floss, what a sight to behold  
Wisdom is better than silver and gold  
I was hopeless, now I'm more hopeful  
Every man want to act like he's exempt  
Need to get down on his knees and repent  
Can't slick talk on the day of judgment  
Your movement's similar to a serpent  
Tried to play straight, how your whole style bent?  
Consequence is no coincidence  
Hypocrites always want to play innocent  
Always want to take it to the full out extent  
Always want to make it seem like good intent  
Never want to face it when it time for punishment  
I know you don't want to hear my opinion  
But there come many paths and you must choose one  
And if you don't change then the rain soon come  
See you might win some, but you just lost one  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done? it's so silly how come?  
You just lost one  
  
Now don't you understand man universal law?  
What you throw out comes back to you, star  
Never underestimate those who you scar  
Cause karma, karma, karma comes back to you hard!  
You can't hold god's people back that long  
The chain of shatan wasn't made that strong  
Trying to pretend like your word is your bond  
But until you do right, all you do will go wrong  
Now some might mistake this for just a simple song  
And some don't know what they have 'til it's gone  
Now even when you're gone you can still be reborn  
And, from the night can arrive the sweet dawn  
Now, some might listen and some might shun  
And some may think that they've reached perfection  
If you look closely you'll see what you've become  
Cause you might win some but you just lost one!  
  
You might win some but you just lost one  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done, it's so silly how come?  
  
You might win some, but you really lost one  
You just lost one, it's so silly how come?  
When it's all done, did you really gain from  
What you done done, it's so silly how come?  
  
You just lost one  
What a bum-bum

Rotating bodies, confusion of sound  
Negative imagery, holding us down  
Social delusion, clearly constructed  
Human condition, morals corrupted  
Trapped in reaction, lawlessness, war  
Dissatisfaction from bowels to core  
Devil's technology, strategy for  
Human mythologies, urban folklore  
Sick of psychology, counterfeit cure  
Wicked theology, robbing the poor  
Scheme demonology mislead the pure  
Strictly strategically studying war  
Light shown in darkness, image exposed  
Few can see through the new emperor's clothes  
Lustful this hustle turn humans to hoes  
When the blind lead the blind  
Just more trouble and woes  
It's the mind that they chose  
Its designed to stay closed  
Standard of jokers, court just a logic  
Sick looking cosmics, from schoolyards to college  
Primitive man with civilize knowledge  
System collapse and he still won't acknowledge  
God is the saviour, studies behavior  
Trying to fix the mix mind that he gave ya  
Stiff-necked scholars on prescription meds  
Wishing their problems were all in their heads  
Moral dilemma, pride is the root  
Misguided from youth, heart divided from truth  
Egyptians and Grecians, spiritually dead  
Imperially led, by the gods in their heads  
Motives and thoughts  
Industrial wealth  
Global economy, in it for self  
Heart full of madness, covered with kind  
Pleasure designed to take over your mind  
Furnished in godliness, painted in good  
This tainted priesthood got real saints misunderstood  
While classes in government, set up the veil  
And cultivate minds for more mythical tales  
Typical Hollywood follies good girl  
While vice and corruption take over the world  
Motives and thoughts  
Check your motives and thoughts  
Blind with the wickedness, deep in your heart  
Modern day wickedness is all you've been taught  
Lied to your neighbors, so you get ahead  
Modern day trickery is all you've been fed  
Motives and thoughts  
Check your motives and thoughts

Yeah, yeaaayh, yeah heh, yeah heh, yeah heh...  
See the road to hell, is paved with good intentions  
Can't you tell, the way they have to mention  
Have they helped you out, you're such a hopeless victim  
Please don't do me any favors, Mr. Intentional  
All their talk, seasoned to perfection  
The road they walk, commanding your affection  
They need to be needed, deceived by motivation  
An opportunity, to further situation  
Why they so important, is without explanation  
Please don't patrionize me, Mr. Intentional  
Oh, ohhh, ohh ohhh  
We give rise to ego, by being insecure  
The advice that we go, desperatly searching for  
The subconscious effort, to support our paramour  
To engage in denial, to admit we're immature  
Validating lies, Mr. Intentional  
Open up yours eyes, Mr. Intentional  
Stuck in a system, that seeks to suck your blood  
Held emotionally hostage, by what everybody does  
Counting all the money, that you give them just because  
Exploiting ignorance, in the name of love  
Stop before you drop because that's just the way it was  
Please don't justify me, Mr. Intentional  
Oh undementional, Mr. Intentional  
Ohhh, oh don't you do me any favors  
Ohhh, ohhhh, ohh ohhhh  
Wake up you've been sleeping  
Take up your bed and walk  
Stop blaming other people  
Oh it's nobody else's fault  
Except the truth about you  
You know that life goes on without you  
And your expensive misinventions  
Disguising your intentions  
Don't worship my hurt feelings, Mr. Intentional  
Oh, oh oh oh  
See I know you can't help me, Mr. Intentional  
The only help I need to live, is unprofessional  
The only wealth I have to give, is not material  
And if you need much more than that, I'm not available  
Please don't entertain me, Mr. Intentional  
Oh I don't need your sympthy, Mr. Intentional  
Stay away from me, Mr. Intentional  
So undementional, Mr. Promotional, Mr. Emotional, Mr. Intentional  
Ohhh ohhhh, ohhhh

Now the skies could fall  
Not even if my boss should call  
The world it seems so very small  
'Cause nothin' even matters, at all  
  
See nothin' even matters  
See nothin' even matters at all  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters at all  
  
See, I don't need no alcohol  
Your love makes me feel ten feet tall  
Without it, I'd go through withdrawal  
'Cause nothin' even matters at all  
  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters at all  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters at all  
  
These buildings could drift out to sea  
Some natural catastrophe  
Still there's no place I'd rather be  
'Cause nothin' even matters to me  
  
See nothin' even matters  
See nothin' even matters to me  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters to me  
  
You're part of my identity  
I sometimes have the tendency  
To look at you religiously, baby  
'Cause nothin' even matters to me  
  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters to me  
Said I don't, my baby, baby  
  
Now you won't find me at no store  
I have no time for manicures  
With you it's never either or  
'Cause nothin' even matters no more  
  
See nothin', it don't matters  
See nothin' even matters no more  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters no more  
  
Now my team could score  
And make it to the final four  
Just repossess my 4 x 4  
'Cause nothin' even matters no more  
  
Nothin' even matters  
Nothin' even matters no more  
Nothin' even matters, oh oh oh  
  
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me  
To me, to me, to me, to me, to me  
  
Nothing even matters  
Nothing even matters no more  
Nothing even matters  
Nothing even matters  
  
Nothing but you  
Nothing but you  
Nothing but you

Your just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you  
You'd be like heaven to touch  
I want to hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you.  
  
Pardon the way that I stare  
There's nothing else to compare  
The site of you leaves me weak  
There are no words left to speak  
But if you feel like I feel  
Please let me know that it's real  
Your just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you.  
  
I need you baby and if it's quite alright  
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights  
I love you baby trust in me when I say, oh yay  
Oh pretty baby don't let me down I pray  
Oh pretty baby now that I found you stay  
And let me love you love you oh baby.  
  
Your just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you  
You'd be like heaven to touch  
I want to hold you so much  
At long last love has arrived  
And I thank God I'm alive  
You're just too good to be true  
Can't take my eyes off of you.  
  
I need you baby and if it's quite alright  
I need you baby to warm the lonely nights  
I love you baby trust in me when I say, it's ok

He says it's impossible...But I know it's possible  
He says it's impossible... But I know it's possible  
  
He says there's no me without him... Please help me forget about him  
He takes all my energy... Trapped in my memory  
Constantly holding me... Constantly holding me  
  
I need to tell you all... All the pain he's caused mmmmm  
I need to tell you I'm... I'm undone because mmmmmm  
  
He says it's impossible... But I know it's possible  
He says it's impossible without him... But I know it's possible  
To finally be in love... And know the real meaning of  
A lasting relationship... Not based on ownership  
I trust every part of you.... Cause all that you say you do  
You love me despite myself  
Sometimes I... I fight myself  
I just can't believe that you.... Would have anything to do  
With someone so insecure... Someone so immature  
Ohh you inspire me, to be the higher me  
  
You make my desire pure... You make my desire pure  
Just tell me what to say... I can't find the words to say  
Please don't be mad with me... I have no identity  
All that I've known is gone... All I was building on  
I wanna walk with you, how do I talk to you?  
  
Touch my mouth with your hands... Touch my mouth with your hands  
  
Oh I wanna understand the meaning of your embrace  
I know now I have to face... The temptations of my past  
Please don't let me disgrace... where my devotion lays  
Now that I know the thruth... Now that it's no excuse  
Keeping me from your love... What was I thinking of  
Holding me from your love... What was I thinking of  
  
You are my peace of mind... That old me is left behind  
You are my peace of mind... That old me is left behind  
  
He says it's impossible... but I know it's possible  
He says it's improbable... but I know it's tangible  
He says it's not grabbable... but I know it's haveable  
Cause anything's possible... Cause anything is possible  
  
Please come free my mind... Please come feed my mind  
Can you see my mind ohh... Won't you come free my mind  
Oh I know it's possible  
  
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything.... yeah  
Anything, anything, anything, anything, .... yeah  
Anything, anything, anything, anything, anything.... yeah  
  
Oh, free... free, free, free your mind

Free, free, free....... free, get free now (repeat)  
  
Your my peace of mind... That old me is left behind  
Your my peace of mind... Your my peace of mind  
He's my peace of mind... He's my peace of mind  
He's my peace of mind... What a joy it is to be alive  
To get another chance, yeah... Every day's another chance  
To get it right this time... everday's another chance  
  
Oh what a merciful... merciful, merciful God  
Oh what a wonderful... wonderful wonderful god (continue to end)  
What a merciful... merciful, merciful, merciful god  
What a wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, merciful  
Merciful, merciful, wonderful  
Merciful, wonderful............

Nothing can be done against the truth  
No matter how we remain in denial  
Wasting time, replacing time with each and every excuse  
But that will only work a little while  
Coping with despair  
Knowing you're not there  
Ashamed to just admit I've been a fool  
So I blame it on the sun  
Run away from everyone  
Hoping to escape this ridicule  
Trapped in misery  
Wrapped so miserably  
And his deception I wear it like a skin  
  
Dying to maintain  
While I keep trying to explain  
A heart that never loved me to begin with  
Oh I'm such a mess  
I have no choice but to confess  
That I have been desperately trying to belong  
Lying to myself and everybody else  
Refusing to admit my right was wrong  
  
And then he came, Selah  
And it means praise and meditation  
And then he came, Selah  
And it means did you think about that  
  
And then he came, Selah  
And it means praise and meditation  
And then he came, Selah  
And it means that you see  
  
How beautiful his fruits still in denial of it's roots  
My guilty heart behaves so foolishly  
This treason from within that reasons with my sin  
Won't be happy till it sees the death of me  
Selfishly addicted to a life that I depicted  
Conflicted 'cause it's not reality  
All that's left of me  
Oh I beg you desperately  
Cause me to agree for what I know is best for me  
Please save me from myself  
I need to save me from myself  
Please save me from myself  
Please save me from myself so I can hear you  
  
The choices that I make have been nothing but mistakes  
What a waste of useless space  
Should I die before I wake  
And all of my religion  
I've fortified this prison  
Obligated to obey, that the man's bad decision  
Please save me from myself  
I need you to save me from myself  
Please save me from myself  
Please save me from myself so I can hear you  
  
And then he came, Selah  
And it means praise and meditation  
And then he came, Selah  
And it means did you think about that  
And he came, Selah  
And it means meditation  
And then he came, Selah  
And it means that it's you  
  
And then it came  
And then he came and he came and he came  
And then he  
And then he came

You're everything I want and more  
Oh I adore your mystery  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
I can't complain no more  
That's how its supposed to be  
I'm not in pain no more ... yeah  
Cause he's so close to me  
It doesn't matter what they say  
I'll be a fool for you  
But is it possible to say?  
Oh if they can't be cool with you  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
I don't get it wrong at all  
I'm in no empty conversations  
I can't be strong at all  
Oh with that vain imagination  
Oh I won't even tolerate  
None of their insane expectations  
What you've given me already  
Oh has me free from obligation ... hey ... hey  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
See it don't bother me at all  
because I'm free from obligation  
Oh I don't even entertain  
None of their insane expectations  
See what you've given me already  
Oh its enough to satisfy  
See you've forgiven me for getting  
All of the pride I had inside  
See now our living can begin  
Because all that's been left behind  
See now our living can begin  
Because that chance has left and I .. I .. I  
And now I just belong to you  
There's no one else to satisfy  
Oh baby I'll be strong for you  
Until they come to realize ... realize ... realize that  
  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
Since I found a new love  
  
I have no fear at all  
No fear at all  
I have no fear at all  
No fear at all  
I have no ... fear at all  
I have no ... fear at all  
I have no fear ... at all  
I have no fear ... at all

Yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah yey  
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why  
Why, Why, heh  
They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
I'll never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ  
I'll never forget no way, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice  
I'll never forget no way, how they turned their back on Paul Bogle  
So don't you forget no way...  
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle  
They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
They've got so very many things, to say right now  
They've got so much things to say  
I'n'I nah come to fight flesh and blood  
But spiritual wickedness in high and low places  
And don't you fight me down  
I'll stand firm, and give Jah all the thanks and praises  
I don't expect to be justified, by these laws of men  
Though the we can find me guilty, Jah will proove my innocency  
'cause when the rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top  
Remember that  
See when this rain falls, it don't, fall on one man's house top  
They've got so much things to say right now  
They've got so much, so much things to say  
They've got, heh, so much things to say right now  
They've got so, so much things to say  
But let them keep talking, oh let them keep talking  
'cause non of them walking, oh non of them walking, no  
And while they still talking, see I'ma be walking  
I'ma be walking, so let them keep talking  
Said I never forget no way, how they crucified Jesus Christ  
And I, I'll never forget, how they sold Marcus Garvey for rice  
Said I, never forget, how they turned their backs on Paul Bogle  
So non of you, non of you forget...  
Who you are, and where you stand in the struggle  
'cause when this rain, 'cause when this rain, rain, rain, rain, rain falls  
It don't fall on one man's house, I'm telling you the rain...

I'm telling you: lie  
They, and they, and they will have so many things  
They'll have so many things to say about you... to say about you  
'cause they don't know me, know me  
They don't know me, oh they don't know me, oh they don't know me  
Oh they don't know me well  
They, they, they, they, they, they, they don't know my Father  
'cause if they did, if they did... hey ey... theeey... heh..

These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
  
Afraid to address  
The reality before me  
Too proud to confess  
That I'm addicted to a lie  
So I seek temporary feeling  
To replace reality  
Though the truth is telling me I have to die  
But I've been taught to numb it  
Sedate it don't confront it  
I hate it when I found out  
That I can't get what I wanted  
This emotional tantrum  
Has become sort of an anthem playing everytime I need to take a little trip  
  
To hide this condemnation  
I'll find a combination  
Of a manmande stimulation  
To deny my situation  
Now this unreality  
Is distorting what I see  
Reporting back to me  
A sense of false security  
  
So in my imagination  
I must find a recreation  
Desperately in searching ways  
To alter my sensations  
There's no equilibrium  
Inebriated till I'm numb  
Intoxicated till I'm dumb  
To avoid confrontation  
  
These social drugs  
Messing with my mind  
These social drugs  
Telling me I'm fine  
  
Now this chemical analogy  
Is our emotional reality  
These political  
Traditional  
And ethical stimulants  
And social ettiquettes  
Wont let us be too upset  
With the way things really are  
You're taught to camouflage regrets  
And those religious structures  
Tell us god want us to suffer  
To suppot a situation  
We all know is obligation  
And if you shun the complication  
They'll just gun your repuation  
Like mob intimidation  
To enforce participation  
  
See they need to keep us fiends  
To their lies and broken schemes  
And if you find another means  
You're told you're being too extreme  
And if you wanted to get clean  
They'll just pull those social strings  
Holding up their social norms  
Deifying noble things  
  
Now were all stuck in tradition  
Unable to state our position  
Too afraid to contradict  
The expectations of the system  
Oh and the harsh reality  
Is they've made Grace for you and me  
Instead of saving you and me  
They're just enslaving you and me!  
  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
These social drugs  
  
Know what I mean?

The sweetest thing I've ever known  
Was like the kiss on the collarbone  
Soft caress of happiness  
The way you walk your style of dress  
I wish I didn't get so weak  
Ooo baby just to hear you speak  
Makes me argue just to see  
How much you're in love with me  
See like a queen a queen upon her throne  
  
[Chorus]  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
It was the sweet sweet sweetest thing I know  
  
I get mad when you walk away (don't walk away)  
So I tell you leave, when I mean stay  
Warm as the sun dipped in black  
Fingertips on the small of my back  
More valuable than all I own  
Like your precious, precious, precious, precious dark skin tone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was the, ah  
I tried to explain  
Ah, but baby, it's in vain  
  
Speaking on my mother's phone  
The touching makes me think I'm grown, (you ain't grown)  
Sweet prince of the ghetto  
Your kisses taste like amaretto  
Intoxicating, oh, so intoxicating  
How sad, how sad that all things come to an end  
But then again, I'm, I'm not alone  
  
[Chorus]

The conquering lion  
Shall break every chain  
The conquering lion  
Shall break every chain  
Give him the victory  
Again and again and again and again  
Give him the victory  
Ohh  
The conquering lion  
Shall break every chain  
The conquering lion  
Shall break every chain  
Give him victory  
Again and again and again and again and again and again  
Give us some victory  
Ohh, yeah  
Ohh, conquering lion  
Shall break every chain, every chain, every chain  
The conquering lion, yeah ohh  
Shall break every chain  
Give us some victory  
We need some victory  
We need some victory  
Again and again and again and again  
Give, give, give, us some victory  
Ohh, ohh, ohh  
The conquering lion  
He'll break every chain  
Every one of your chains, every one of your chains  
The conquering lion  
Hey, he's gonna break all of those chains if you just let him  
Give him, give him the victory, give him the victory  
Again and again and again and again  
Give him the victory  
Ohh, ohh, ohh

My world it moves so fast today  
The past it seems so far away  
And life squeezes so tight that I can't breathe  
And every time I try to be, what someone else has thought of me  
So caught up, I wasn't able to achieve  
  
But deep in my heart, the answer it was in me  
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny  
  
I look at my environment  
And wonder where the fire went  
What happened to everything we used to be  
I hear so many cry for help  
Searching outside of themselves  
Now I know his strength is within me  
  
And deep in my heart, the answer it was in me  
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny  
  
And deep in my heart  
And deep in my heart, the answer it was in me  
And I made up my mind to define my own destiny

If they only owned love, shown love, grown love, like this before  
If they only knew love, true love, to love, like this before  
If they only gave love, saved love, brave love, like this before  
If they only called love, love love, called love, like this before  
  
If they'd only showed love, they owed love, owed love, like this before  
If they only showed love, they owed love, owed love, like this before  
If they only knew love, true love, to love, like this before  
If they only gave love, saved love, brave love, like this before  
If they only showed love, they owed love, they owed love, like this before  
  
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la, La la la la la...  
Like this before  
If they ever showed love, they owed love, they owed love, they owed love  
If they ever showed love, they owed love, they owed love, like this before  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, yeah  
La la la la la, la la la la, la la la la la, la la la la...  
  
If they only claimed love, claimed love, claimed love  
They maintained love  
Instead they drained love, stained love  
They didn't control love, my soul loves a whole love, like this before  
  
Received the same love  
If they didn't regret love, forget love, say they never met love  
If they will love, don't kill love, just be still love [Repeat: x 4]

This potion might, (Uh)this ocean might (Uh) carry me (Uh)  
In a wave of emotion to ask you to marry me  
And every word, every second, and every third  
Expresses the happiness more clearly than ever heard (Uh)  
And when I play 'em, every chord is a poem  
Telling the Lord how grateful I am because I know him  
The harmonies (Word) possess a sensation similar to your caress (Uh)

When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)  
(when it hurts so bad)  
  
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)  
(when it hurts so bad)  
  
I loved real, real hard once  
But the love wasn't returned  
Found out the man I'd die for  
He wasn't even concerned  
I tried, and I tried, and I tried  
To keep him in my life (to keep him in my life)  
I cried, and I cried, and I cried  
But I couldn't make it right  
  
But I, I loved the young man  
And if you ever been in love  
Then you'd understand  
  
That what you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you don't catch it (if you don't catch it)  
(if you don't catch it)  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it (if you just let it)  
If you just let it (if you just let it)  
  
See, I thought this feeling  
It was all that I had  
But how could this be love  
And make me feel so bad? (gave up my power)  
Gave up my power  
I existed for you  
But who-ever knew  
The voo-doo you'd do  
  
But I, I loved the young man  
And if you ever been in love  
Then you'd understand  
  
What you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)  
(if you don't, you don't)  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)  
If you just let it (if you don't, you don't)  
  
See what you want might make you cry  
What you need might pass you by  
If you don't catch it (if you don't, you don't)  
(if you don't, you don't)  
  
And what you need ironically  
Will turn out what you want to be  
If you just let it  
If you just let it  
  
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)  
(when it hurts so bad)  
  
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
When it hurts so bad (when it hurts so bad)  
Why's it feel so good? (when it hurts so bad)
