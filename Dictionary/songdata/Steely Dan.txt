I remember Christmas morning  
Back in 1954  
When we moved up to Mount Savage  
As if it mattered anymore  
Mama always said  
How the air can clear her head  
  
We were colder and much higher  
Than we ever were before  
I recall her tailored jersey  
And the flowers that she wore  
Years ago I tried to tell her  
What was in my heart  
But she was part of the city  
  
[Chorus]  
She took a little with sugar  
She took the money from my old man  
She took a little with sugar  
She took the money from my old man  
  
All the years that she was with us  
You could count them on one hand  
I was taken with her showboat style  
But too young to understand  
She was all alone  
Ahead of her time  
She was first generation  
  
[Chorus]

Up on the hill  
People never stare  
They just don't care  
Chinese music under banyan trees  
Here at the dude ranch above the sea  
Aja  
When all my dime dancin' is through  
I run to you  
  
Up on the hill  
They've got time to burn  
There's no return  
Double helix in the sky tonight  
Throw out the hardware  
Let's do it right  
Aja  
When all my dime dancin' is through  
I run to you  
  
Up on the hill  
They think I'm okay  
Or so they say  
Chinese music always sets me free  
Angular banjoes  
Sound good to me  
Aja  
When all my dime dancin' is through  
I run to you

I'm working on gospel time these days  
(The summer this could be the cool part of the summer)  
  
The sloe eyed creature in the reckless room she's so severe  
A wise child walks right out of here  
  
I'm so excited I can barely cope  
I'm sizzling like an isotope  
I'm on fire so cut me some slack  
  
First she's way gone then she comes back  
She's all business then she's ready to play  
She's almost gothic in a natural way  
  
This house of desire is built foursquare  
(The city the cleanest kitten in the city)  
  
When she speaks it's like the slickest song I ever heard  
I'm hanging on her every word  
As if I'm not already blazed enough  
She hits me with the cryptic stuff  
That's her style, to jerk me around  
  
First she's all feel then she cools down  
She's pure science with a splash of black cat  
She's almost gothic and I like it like that  
  
This dark place so thrilling and new  
It's kind of like the opposite of an aerial view  
Unless I'm totally wrong  
I hear her rap and brother it's strong  
  
I'm pretty sure that what she's telling me is mostly lies  
But I just stand there hypnotized  
  
I'll just have to make it work somehow  
I'm in the amen corner now  
It's called love, I spell L -you- V  
  
First she's all buzz then she's noise-free  
She's bubbling over then there's nothing to say  
She's almost gothic in a natural way  
  
She's old school then she's like young  
Little Eva meets the Bleecker Street brat  
She's almost gothic but it's better than that

I never seen you looking so bad my funky one  
You tell me that your superfine mind has come undone  
  
[Chorus]  
Any major dude with half a heart surely will tell you my friend  
Any minor world that breaks apart falls together again  
When the demon is at your door  
In the morning it won't be there no more  
Any major dude will tell you  
  
Have you ever seen a squonk's tears? Well, look at mine  
The people on the street have all seen better times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can tell you all I know, the where to go, the what to do  
You can try to run but you can't hide from what's inside of you  
  
[Chorus]

If I had my way  
I would move to another lifetime  
I'd quit my job  
Ride the train through the misty nighttime  
I'll be ready when my feet touch ground  
Wherever I come down  
And if the folks will have me  
Then they'll have me  
  
[Chorus]  
Any world that I'm welcome to  
Is better than the one I come from  
  
I can hear your words  
When you speak of what you are and have seen  
I can see your hand  
Reaching out through a shining daydream  
Where the days and nights are not the same  
Captured happy in a picture frame  
Honey I will be there  
Yes I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got this thing inside me  
That's got to find a place to hide me  
I only know I must obey  
This feeling I can't explain away  
  
I think I'll go to the park  
Watch the children playing  
Perhaps I'll find in my head  
What my heart is saying  
A vision of a child returning  
A kingdom where the sky is burning  
Honey I will be there  
Yes I'll be there  
  
[Chorus]

Drive west on Sunset  
To the sea  
Turn that jungle music down  
Just until we're out of town  
  
This is no one night stand  
It's a real occasion  
Close your eyes and you'll be there  
It's everything they say  
  
The end of a perfect day  
Distant lights from across the bay  
Babylon sisters shake it  
Babylon sisters shake it  
  
So fine so young  
Tell me I'm the only one  
  
Here come those Santa Ana winds again  
  
We'll jog with show folk on the sand  
Drink kirschwasser from a shell  
San Francisco show and tell  
Well I should know by now  
  
That it's just a spasm  
Like a Sunday in T.J.  
That it's cheap but it's not free  
That I'm not what I used to be  
And that love's not a game for three  
  
Babylon sisters shake it  
Babylon sisters shake it  
So fine so young  
Tell me I'm the only one  
  
My friends say no don't go  
For that cotton candy  
Son you're playing with fire  
The kid will live and learn  
As he watches his bridges burn  
From the point of no return  
  
Babylon sisters shake it  
Babylon sisters shake it  
So fine so young  
Tell me I'm the only one

Five names that I can hardly  
Stand to hear  
Including yours and mine  
And one more chimp who isn't here  
I can see the ladies talking  
How the times are getting hard  
And that fearsome excavation  
On Magnolia Boulevard  
  
[CHORUS:]  
And I'm going insane  
And I'm laughing at the frozen rain  
And I'm so alone  
Honey when they gonna send me home  
Bad sneakers and a Pina Colada  
My friend  
Stompin' on the avenue  
By Radio City with a  
Transistor and a large  
Sum of money to spend  
  
You fellah, you tearin' up the street  
You wear that white tuxedo  
How you gonna beat the heat  
Do you take me for a fool  
Do you think that I don't see  
That ditch out in the valley  
That they're digging just for me  
  
[CHORUS]

When Black Friday comes  
I'll stand down by the door  
And catch the grey men when they  
Dive from the fourteenth floor  
  
When Black Friday comes  
I'll collect everything I'm owed  
And before my friends find out  
I'll be on the road  
  
When Black Friday falls you know it's got to be  
Don't let it fall on me  
When Black Friday comes  
I'll fly down to Muswellbrook  
  
Gonna strike all the big red words  
From my little black book  
Gonna do just what I please  
Gonna wear no socks and shoes  
  
With nothing to do but feed  
All the kangaroos  
When Black Friday comes I'll be on that hill  
You know I will  
  
When Black Friday comes  
I'm gonna dig myself a hole  
Gonna lay down in it 'til  
I satisfy my soul  
  
Gonna let the world pass by me  
The Archbishop's gonna sanctify me  
And if he don't come across  
I'm gonna let it roll  
  
When Black Friday comes  
I'm gonna stake my claim  
I'll guess I'll change my name

I was scrapin' bottom  
Gropin' in the dark  
It takes a crusty punk to really beat  
The mean streets of Medicine Park  
So I shifted left for out of town  
Then I clicked my heels and I doubled down to  
  
Blues Beach  
I'm frying  
Sizzlin' in the merciful rays  
And it's the long sad Sunday  
Of the early resigned  
  
I went to Central Station  
To catch that early bus  
They were gassed and runnin' every which way  
But unhappily not for us  
Here comes Trina, the child bride  
I said hey pretty girl, can I cop a ride to  
  
Blues Beach  
It's rainin'  
I'm chillin' at the Manatee Bar  
Well it's a stone soul picnic  
For the early resigned  
  
We could rent a paranymphic glider  
My hypothetical friend  
And we could sail  
'Til the bending end  
  
Grab Big Dog a blanket  
Angel of my heart  
Things may get a whole lot worse  
Before suddenly falling apart  
Give your roommate Yvonne a ring  
Cause if she still wants in I gotta pull some strings  
  
On Blues Beach  
I'm dying  
Freezin' in the merciful rays  
And it's the long sad Sunday  
Of the early resigned

Some turnout, a hundred grand  
Get with it we'll shake his hand  
Don't bother to understand  
Don't question the little man  
Be part of the brotherhood  
Yes it's chain lightning  
It feels so good  
Hush brother, we cross the square  
Act natural like you don't care  
Turn slowly and comb your hair  
Don't trouble the midnight air  
We're standing just where he stood  
It was chain lightning  
It feels so good

If you listen you can hear it  
It's the laughter in the street  
It's the motion in the music  
And the fire beneath your feet  
All the signs are right this time  
You don't have to try so very hard  
If you live in this world  
You're feelin' the change of the guard  
  
All the cowboys and your neighbors  
Can you swallow up your pride  
Take your guns off it you're willin'  
And you know we're on your side  
If you want to get through the years  
It's high time you played your card  
If you live in this world  
You're feelin' the change of the guard

Charlie Freak had but one thing to call his own  
Three weight ounce pure golden ring no precious stone  
Five nights without a bite  
No place to lay his head  
  
And if nobody takes him in  
He'll soon be dead  
On the street he spied my face I heard him hail  
In our plot of frozen space he told his tale  
  
Poor man, he showed his hand  
So righteous was his need  
And me so wise I bought his prize  
For chicken feed  
  
Newfound cash soon begs to smash a state of mind  
Close inspection fast revealed his favorite kind  
Poor kid, he overdid  
Embraced the spreading haze  
  
And while he sighed his body died  
In fifteen ways  
  
When I heard I grabbed a cab to where he lay  
'Round his arm the plastic tag read D.O.A.  
Yes Jack, I gave it back  
The ring I could not own  
  
Now come my friend I'll take your hand  
And lead you home

Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more  
He don't celebrate Sunday on a Saturday night  
No more  
Daddy don't need no lock and key  
For the piece he stowed  
Out on Avenue D  
Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more  
Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado  
No more  
He don't travel on down to the neighborhood  
Liquor store  
Lucy still loves her coke and rum  
But she sits alone  
Cause her daddy can't come  
Daddy don't drive in that Eldorado  
No more  
  
Driving like a fool out to Hackensack  
Drinking his dinner from a paper sack  
He says I gotta see a joker  
And I'll be right back  
  
Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more  
He can't get tight every night  
Pass out on the barroom floor  
Daddy can't get no fine cigar  
But we know you're smoking  
Wherever you are  
Daddy don't live in that New York City  
No more

This is the day of the expanding man  
That shape is my shade  
There where I used to stand  
It seems like only yesterday  
I gazed through the glass  
At ramblers, wild gamblers  
That's all in the past  
  
You call me a fool  
You say it's a crazy scheme  
This one's for real  
I already bought the dream  
So useless to ask me why  
Throw a kiss and say goodbye  
I'll make it this time  
I'm ready to cross that fine line  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll learn to work the saxophone  
I play just what I feel  
Drink Scotch whiskey all night long  
And die behind the wheel  
They got a name for the winners in the world  
And I want a name when I lose  
They call Alabama the Crimson Tide  
Call me Deacon Blues  
  
My back to the wall  
A victim of laughing chance  
This is for me  
The essence of true romance  
Sharing the things we know and love  
With those of my kind  
Libations  
Sensations  
That stagger the mind  
  
I crawl like a viper  
Through these suburban streets  
Make love to these women  
Languid and bittersweet  
I'll rise when the sun goes down  
Cover every game in town  
A world of my own  
I'll make it my home sweet home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the night of the expanding man  
I take one last drag  
As I approach the stand  
I cried when I wrote this song  
Sue me if I play too long  
This brother is free  
I'll be what I want to be

Times are hard  
You're afraid to pay the fee  
So you find yourself somebody  
Who can do the job for free  
When you need a bit of lovin'  
Cause your man is out of town  
That's the time you get me runnin'  
And you know I'll be around  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
I don't want to do your dirty work  
No more  
I'm a fool to do your dirty work  
Oh yeah  
  
Light the candle  
Put the lock upon the door  
You have sent the maid home early  
Like a thousand times before  
Like the castle in its corner  
In a medieval game  
I foresee terrible trouble  
And I stay here just the same  
  
[Chorus]

Katy tried  
I was halfway crucified  
I was on the other side  
Of no tomorrow  
You walked in  
And my life began again  
Just when I'd spent the last piaster  
I could borrow  
All night long  
We would sing that stupid song  
And every word we sang  
I knew was true  
Are you with me Doctor Wu  
Are you really just a shadow  
Of the man that I once knew  
Are you crazy are you high  
Or just an ordinary guy  
Have you done all you can do  
Are you with me Doctor  
  
Don't seem right  
I've been strung out here all night  
I've been waiting for the taste  
You said you'd bring to me  
Biscayne Bay  
Where the Cuban gentlemen sleep all day  
I went searching for the song  
You used to sing to me  
Katy lies  
You could see it in her eyes  
But imagine my surprise  
When I saw you  
  
Are you with me Doctor Wu  
Are you really just a shadow  
Of the man that I once knew  
She is lovely yes she's sly  
And you're an ordinary guy  
Has she finally got to you  
Can you hear me Doctor

I hear you found a brand new friend  
Well if I try to take you back again  
If I decide to make amends  
Don't let me in  
You know, I'd like to be inside  
But don't you listen when you hear me cry  
Not even just to say goodbye  
Don't let me in  
I say no no no no, oh no  
Don't let me in  
I say no no no no, oh no  
Don't let me in  
Don't let me in  
I never wanna do you harm  
Don't pay no head to all my false alarm  
If I should come with pleading arms  
Don't let me in  
You hear it knocking on your door  
You pound another heart you can't ignore  
But soon it isn't there no more  
[Chorus]  
[Solo]  
[Chorus (3x)]  

Agents of the law  
Luckless pedestrian  
I know you're out there  
With rage in your eyes and your megaphones  
Saying all is forgiven  
Mad dog surrender  
How can I answer  
A man of my mind can do anything  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm a bookkeeper's son  
I don't want to shoot no one  
Well I crossed my old man back in Oregon  
Don't take me alive  
Got a case of dynamite  
I could hold out here all night  
Yes I crossed my old man back in Oregon  
Don't take me alive  
  
Can you hear the evil crowd  
The lies and the laughter  
I hear my inside  
The mechanized hum of another world  
Where no sun is shining  
No red light flashing  
Here in this darkness  
I know what I've done  
I know all at once who I am  
  
[Chorus]

Kids if you want some fun  
Mr. LaPage is your man  
He's always laughing, having fun  
Showing his films in the den  
Come on, come on  
Soon you will be eighteen  
I think you know what I mean  
Don't tell your mama  
Your daddy or mama  
They'll never know where you been  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyone's gone to the movies  
Now we're alone at last  
  
Listen to what I say  
He wants to show you the way  
Right down the hallway with open arms  
To teach you a new game to play  
Come on, come on  
Soon it will be too late  
Bobbing for apples can wait  
We know you're used to sixteen or more  
Sorry we only have eight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Kids if you want some fun  
See what you never have seen  
Take off your cheaters and sit right down  
Start the projection machine  
  
[Chorus]

Where did the bastard run  
Is he still around  
Now you gotta tell me everything you did baby  
I'm gonna get a gun  
  
Shoot the lover down  
Are you gonna tell me everything you did baby  
Traces are everywhere  
In our happy home  
  
Now you better tell me everything you did baby  
I jumped out of my easy chair  
It was not my own  
Now I want to hear about everything you did baby  
  
I never knew you  
You were a roller skater  
You gonna show me later  
Turn up the Eagles the neighbors are listening  
  
You know how people talk  
I wonder what they say  
I think you better tell me everything you did baby  
  
I never knew you  
You were a roller skater  
You gonna show me later  
  
You never came to me  
When you were so inclined  
Yes you could have told me everything you did baby  
I know where baby's at  
I know your filthy mind  
Now you're gonna do me everything you did baby

I decline  
To walk the line  
They tell me that I'm lazy  
Worldly wise  
I realize  
That everybody's crazy  
A woman's voice reminds me  
To serve and not to speak  
Am I myself or just another freak  
  
Don't you know  
There's fire in the hole  
And nothing left to burn  
I'd like to run out now  
There's nowhere left to turn  
  
With a cough  
I shake it off  
And work around my yellow stripe  
Should I hide  
And eat my pride  
Or wait until it's good and ripe  
My life is boiling over  
It's happened once before  
I wish someone would open up the door  
  
Don't you know  
There's fire in the hole  
And nothing left to burn  
I'd like to run out now  
There's nowhere left to turn

Worry the bottle Mamma, it's grapefruit wine  
Kick off your high heel sneakers, it's party time  
The girls don't seem to care what's on  
As long as it plays till dawn  
Nothin' but blues and Elvis  
And somebody else's favorite song  
  
Give her some funked up music, she treats you nice  
Feed her some hungry reggae, she'll love you twice  
The girls don't seem to care tonight  
As long as the mood is right  
  
FM - no static at all  
  
Give her some funked up music she treats you nice  
Feed her some hungry reggae she'll love you twice  
The girls don't seem to care tonight  
As long as the mood is right  
  
FM - no static at all

Just when I say  
"Boy we can't miss  
You are golden"  
Then you do this  
You say this guy is so cool  
Snapping his fingers like a fool  
One more expensive kiss-off  
Who do you think I am  
Lord I know you're a special friend  
But you don't seem to understand  
We got heavy rollers  
I think you should know  
Try again tomorrow  
  
Can't you see they're laughing at me  
Get rid off him  
I don't care what you do at home  
Would you care to explain  
  
Who is the gaucho amigo  
Why is he standing  
In your spangled leather poncho  
And your elevator shoes  
Bodacious cowboys  
Such as your friend  
Will never be welcome here  
High in the Custerdome  
  
What I tell you  
Back down the line  
I'll scratch your back  
You can scratch mine  
No he can't sleep on the floor  
What do you think I'm yelling for  
I'll drop him near the freeway  
Doesn't he have a home  
  
Lord I know you're a special friend  
But you refuse to understand  
You're a nasty schoolboy  
With no place to go  
Try again tomorrow  
  
Don't tell me he'll wait in the car  
Look at you  
Holding hands with the man from Rio  
Would you care to explain  
  
Who is the gaucho amigo  
Why is he standing  
In your spangled leather poncho  
With the studs that match your eyes  
Bodacious cowboys  
Such as your friend  
Will never be welcome here  
High in the Custerdome

In the beginning  
We could hang with the dude  
But it's been too much of nothing  
Of that stank attitude  
Now they curse your name  
And there's a bounty on your face  
It's your own fault daddy  
Godwhacker's on the case  
  
We track your almighty ass  
Through seven heaven-worlds  
Me, Slinky Redfoot  
And our trusty angel-girls  
And when the stars bleed out  
That be the fever of the chase  
You better get gone poppie  
Godwhacker's on the case  
  
Be very very quiet  
Clock everything you see  
Little things might matter later  
At the start of the end of history  
  
Climb up the glacier  
Across bridges of light  
We sniff you, Big Tiger  
In the forest of the night  
Cause there's no escape  
From the Rajahs of Erase  
You better run run run  
Godwhacker's on the case  
  
Be very very quiet  
Clock everything you see  
Little things might matter later  
At the start of the end of history  
  
Yes we are the Godwhackers  
Who rip and chop and slice  
For crimes beyond imagining  
It's time to pay the price  
You better step back son  
Give the man some whackin' space  
You know this might get messy  
Godwhacker's on the case

My coat is black and the moon is yellow  
Here is where I get off  
As you can see for yourself old girl in the Green Book  
I tango down to the smoky lobby  
My eyes adjust to the light  
The new cashier looks like Jill St. John  
Can that be right?  
I'm rolling into the bar at Joey's  
They're getting ready to close  
And here she comes very "Kiss Me Deadly"  
My life, my love, my third hand rose  
Flash ahead to a yummy playback  
Just you and me in a room  
Double dreaming a page at a time in the Green Book  
  
The torso rocks and the eyes are keepers  
Now where'd we sample those legs?  
I'm thinking Marilyn 4.0 in the Green Book  
I like the neon I love the music  
Anachronistic but nice  
The seamless segue from fun to fever  
It's a sweet device  
I'm so in love with this dirty city  
This crazy grid of desire  
The festive icons along the way  
The boardwalk, the lovers, the house on fire  
She's kinda cute but a little younger  
She's got the mood and the moves  
It's kinda scary to dig yourself in the Green Book

Uptown  
It's murder out in the street  
Uptown  
It's murder out in the street  
That's where I found my mandarin plum  
That's where you'd be if you found one  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street  
Since may  
There's trouble most every night  
Where once we danced our sweet routine  
It reeks of wine and kerosene  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street  
There's a special place for lovers  
One we understand  
There where neon bends in daylight sky  
In that sunny room she soothes me  
Cools me with her fan  
We're drifting  
A thousand years roll by  
Lou chang  
Her brother he's burning with rage  
Lou chang  
Her brother he's burning with rage  
I'd like to know what's on his mind  
He says hey buddy you're not my kind  
Where the nights are bright  
And joy is complete  
Keep my squeeze on green flower street  

Down at the Lido they welcome you  
With sausage and beer,  
Klaus and the Rooster have been there too,  
But lately he spends his time here.  
  
Hanging with the mayor and all his friends  
And nobody cares,  
Where the sailor shuts out the sunrise  
Blacked out on the stairs  
  
[Chorus]  
Knock twice, rap with your cane  
Feels nice, you're out of the rain  
We got your skinny girl  
Here at the Western World  
  
Ruthie will give you the silver key  
To open the red door:  
Lay down your Jackson and you will see  
The sweetness you've been crying for  
  
In the night you hide from the madman  
You're longing to be  
But it all comes out on the inside  
Eventually  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In the night you hide from the madman  
You're longing to be  
But it all comes out on the inside  
Eventually  
  
[Chorus]

Way back when in sixty-seven  
I was the dandy  
Of Gamma Chi  
Sweet things from Boston  
So young and willing  
Moved down to Scarsdale  
And where the hell am I  
  
Hey Nineteen  
No we can't dance together  
No we can't talk at all  
Please take me along  
When you slide on down  
  
Hey Nineteen  
That's 'Retha Franklin  
She don't remember the Queen of Soul  
It's hard times befallen  
The Soul Survivors  
She thinks I'm crazy  
But I'm just growin' old  
  
Hey Nineteen  
No we got nothin' in common  
No we can't talk at all  
Please take me along  
When you slide on down  
  
The Cuervo Gold  
The fine Colombian  
Make tonight a wonderful thing  
  
We can't dance together  
No we can't talk at all

You  
In your lark  
You're a mark  
You're a screamer  
You know  
How to hustle  
Daddy  
Is a rare  
Millionaire  
I don't care  
Yeah you  
Got the muscle  
I got the news  
  
Yes dear  
How did you know  
Can't you see our love will grow  
  
Take it  
In your hand  
All the sirens  
And the band  
Get to bendin' my ear  
How  
Was I to know  
About the warm  
Soulful secret  
You been keepin' for years  
I got the news  
  
Slow down I'll tell you when  
I may never walk again  
  
Broadway Duchess  
Darling if you only knew  
Half as much as  
Everybody thinks you do  
What I hear  
May be true  
I would still be proud  
To know you  
  
Spanish kissin'  
See it glisten  
You came ragin'  
Love rampagin'  
I got the news  
  
Yes dear  
How did you know  
Can't you see our love will grow

Standing tough under stars and stripes  
We can tell  
This dream's in sight  
You've got to admit it  
  
At this point in time that it's clear  
The future looks bright  
On that train all graphite and glitter  
Undersea by rail  
  
Ninety minutes from New York to Paris  
Well by seventy-six we'll be A.O.K.  
  
What a beautiful world this will be  
What a glorious time to be free  
  
Get your ticket to that wheel in space  
While there's time  
The fix is in  
You'll be a witness to that game of chance in the sky  
  
You know we've got to win  
Here at home we'll play in the city  
Powered by the sun  
Perfect weather for a streamlined world  
There'll be spandex jackets one for everyone  
  
What a beautiful world this will be  
What a glorious time to be free  
  
On that train all graphite and glitter  
Undersea by rail  
Ninety minutes from New York to Paris  
(More leisure for artists everywhere)  
  
A just machine to make big decisions  
Programmed by fellows with compassion and vision  
We'll be clean when their work is done  
We'll be eternally free yes and eternally young  
  
What a beautiful world this will be  
What a glorious time to be free

While the music played you worked by candlelight  
Those San Francisco nights  
You were the best in town  
Just by chance you crossed the diamond with the pearl  
  
You turned it on the world  
That's when you turned the world around  
Did you feel like Jesus  
Did you realize  
  
That you were a champion in their eyes  
On the hill the stuff was laced with kerosene  
But yours was kitchen clean  
Everyone stopped to stare at your technicolor motor home  
  
Every A-Frame had your number on the wall  
You must have had it all  
You'd go to L.A. on a dare  
And you'd go it alone  
  
Could you live forever  
Could you see the day  
Could you feel your whole world fall apart and fade away  
  
[Chorus]  
Get along, get along Kid Charlemagne  
Get along Kid Charlemagne  
  
Now your patrons have all left you in the red  
Your low rent friends are dead  
This life can be very strange  
All those dayglow freaks who used to paint the face  
  
They've joined the human race  
Some things will never change  
Son you were mistaken  
You are obsolete  
Look at all the white men on the street  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Clean this mess up else we'll all end up in jail  
Those test tubes and the scale  
Just get them all out of here  
Is there gas in the car  
  
Yes, there's gas in the car  
I think the people down the hall  
Know who you are  
  
Careful what you carry  
'Cause the man is wise  
You are still an outlaw in their eyes  
  
[Chorus]

Hello one and all  
Was it you I used to know  
Can't you hear me call  
On this old ham radio  
All I got to say  
I'm alive and feeling fine  
If you come my way  
You can share my poison wine  
  
[Chorus]  
No marigolds in the promised land  
There's a hole in the ground  
Where they used to grow  
Any man left on the Rio Grande  
Is the king of the world  
As far as I know  
  
I don't want your bread  
I don't need your helping hand  
I can't be no savage  
I can't be no highwayman  
Show me where you are  
You and I will spend this day  
Driving in my car  
Through the ruins of Santa Fe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm reading last year's papers  
Although I don't know why  
Assassins cons and rapers  
Might as well die  
  
If you come around  
No more pain and no regrets  
Watch the sun go brown  
Smoking cobalt cigarettes  
There's no need to hide  
Taking things the easy way  
If I stay inside  
I might live til Saturday  
  
[Chorus]

What's this fierce new change?  
Has your juggernaut reached my door?  
Am I out of range?  
Think another thought before  
Babies are ground up  
In the last big round-up  
Ease your head play it cool in a patio chair  
Try to design a postcard from your mind  
Piggy bank ooooo-whee  
If it's Heaven-sent then you'll go far  
Listen well to me  
Smoke that 7 cent cigar  
Can that rumble  
And Avogadro's Number  
[Chorus]  
Polaroid galore  
Snap my jelly roll  
Count your change  
For your midnight chore  
Play that "sell-your-soul" exchange  
Menthol filter tips  
Danglin' from your nether lip  
[Chorus]  
If John Doe writes another book  
With words that just won't quit  
Why must I forge through it?  
Let George do it  

I got one and you want four  
It's so hard to help you  
I can't keep up with you no more  
And you treat me like it's a sin  
But you can't lock me in  
You want me here with you right to the end  
No thank you my friend  
I fear the monkey in your soul  
  
Won't you turn that bebop down  
I can't hear my heart beat  
Where's that fatback chord I found?  
Honey don't you think it was wrong  
To interrupt my song?  
I'll pack my things and run so far from here  
Goodbye dear  
  
I fear the monkey in your soul

I remember the thirty-five sweet goodbyes  
When you put me on the Wolverine  
Up to Annandale  
It was still September  
When your daddy was quite surprised  
To find you with the working girls  
In the county jail  
I was smoking with the boys upstairs  
When I heard about the whole affair  
I said oh no  
William and Mary won't do  
  
[Chorus]  
Well I did not think the girl  
Could be so cruel  
And I'm never going back  
To my old school  
  
Oleanders growing outside her door  
Soon they're gonna be in bloom  
Up in Annandale  
I can't stand her  
Doing what she did before  
Living like a gypsy queen  
In a fairy tale  
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go  
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico  
She said oh no  
Guadalajara won't do  
  
[Chorus]  
  
California tumbles into the sea  
That'll be the day I go  
Back to Annandale  
Tried to warn you  
About Chino and Daddy Gee  
But I can't seem to get to you  
Through the U.S. Mail  
Well I hear the whistle but I can't go  
I'm gonna take her down to Mexico  
She said oh no  
Guadalajara won't do  
  
[Chorus]

Savoy sides presents a new saxophone sensation  
It's Parker's band with a smooth style of syncopation  
Kansas City born and growing  
You won't believe what the boys are blowing  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band  
  
You'll be riding by, bareback on your armadillo  
You'll be grooving high or relaxing at Camarillo  
Suddenly the music hits you  
It's a bird in flight that just can't quit you  
  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parker's band  
  
We will spend a dizzy weekend smacked into a trance  
Me and you will listen to  
A little bit of what made the preacher dance  
  
Bring your horn along and you can add to the pure confection  
And if you can't fly you'll have to move in with the rhythm section  
Either way you're bound to function  
Fifty-Second Street's the junction  
  
You got to come on man  
And take a piece of Mister Parker's  
Clap your hands and take a piece of Mister Parker's  
Come on man and take a piece of Mister Parker's band

I've seen your picture  
Your name in lights above it  
This is your big debut  
It's like a dream come true  
And when you smile for the camera  
I know they're love it  
  
I got your pin shot  
I keep it with your letter  
Done up in blueprint blue  
It sure looks good on you  
So won't you smile for the camera  
I know I'll love you better  
  
Peg  
It will come back to you  
Peg  
It will come back to you  
Then the shutter falls  
You see it all in 3-D  
It's your favorite foreign movie

Our man Abu squeezes off twenty tracer rounds  
And that's when she jumps the turnstile  
And as she clings to the roof of the speeding train  
The Double A down to Sheridan Square  
Her cell phone rings  
It's, like, her stupid father  
Be in the door by ten, again  
  
Pixeleen  
Dream deep my three-times perfect ultrateen  
Pixeleen  
Born in the bogs of Jersey  
Trained how to love and spy hard  
Dropped on the streets of Roppongi  
Soaked through on the floor of a noodle shop  
  
And when Abu rams the clip in the mini-Glock  
Up on the catwalk inside the warehouse  
You whip a knife from the top of your go-go boot  
With just a flash of spectacular thigh  
Your pager starts to throb  
It's your as-if boyfriend Randall  
Better keep it real, or whatever  
  
Pixeleen  
Rave on my sleek and soulful cyberqueen  
Pixeleen  
Penned by a hack in the Palisades  
Backed by some guys from Columbia  
Shot all in digital video  
For a million and change  
  
Flashback to cool summer nights  
Freddy can we cut to the chase?  
In the room above your garage  
Everything about me is different  
Symmetrical and clean  
  
This is what I see  
Just a girl in girlie trouble  
Dancing in the video with gun and tambourine  
  
Pixeleen  
Be good my three-times perfect ultrateen  
Pixeleen  
Born on the floor of a noodle shop  
Dropped in the bogs of Jersey  
Shot by a guy from Columbia  
Soaked through all in digital video  
Girl with the sweet backstory  
Pitched in a trailer in Burbank  
Cast by a cool enough yes man  
Screened at a festival in Utah

I would love to tour the Southland  
In a traveling minstrel show  
Yes I'd love to tour the Southland  
In a traveling minstrel show  
Yes I'm dying to be a star and make them laugh  
Sound just like a record on the phonograph  
Those days are gone forever  
Over a long time ago, oh yeah  
I have never met Napoleon  
But I plan to find the time  
I have never met Napoleon  
But I plan to find the time  
'Cause he looks so fine upon that hill  
They tell me he was lonely, he's lonely still  
Those days are gone forever  
Over a long time ago, oh yeah  
  
I stepped up on the platform  
The man gave me the news  
He said, You must be joking son  
Where did you get those shoes?  
Where did you get those shoes?  
  
Well, I've seen 'em on the TV, the movie show  
They say the times are changing but I just don't know  
These things are gone forever  
Over a long time ago, oh yeah

We hear you're leaving, that's OK  
I thought our little wild time had just begun  
I guess you kind of scared yourself, you turn and run  
But if you have a change of heart  
  
[Chorus]  
Rikki don't lose that number  
You don't want to call nobody else  
Send it off in a letter to yourself  
Rikki don't lose that number  
It's the only one you own  
You might use it if you feel better  
When you get home  
  
I have a friend in town, he's heard your name  
We can go out driving on Slow Hand Row  
We could stay inside and play games, I don't know  
And you could have a change of heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You tell yourself you're not my kind  
But you don't even know your mind  
And you could have a change of heart  
  
[Chorus]

Rose darling come to me  
Snake Mary's gone to bed  
All our steaming sounds of love  
Cannot disturb her in her night  
  
Or raise her sleeping head  
All I ask of you  
Is make my wildest dreams come true  
No one sees and no one knows  
  
Rose darling come to me  
Snake Mary dreams along  
I would guess she's in Detroit  
With lots of money in the bank  
  
Although I could be wrong  
You must know it's right  
The spoor is on the wind tonight  
You won't feel it till it grows  
  
[Chorus]  
Rose darling my friend  
With only you and what I've found  
We'll wear the weary hours down  
  
Rose darling come to me  
The clock is close at hand  
All my empty words of love  
Can never screen the flash I feel  
  
Or make you understand  
Honey can't you see  
I know it's real it's got to be  
Why not chase it where it goes  
  
[Chorus]

Have you heard about the boom on Mizar Five  
People got to shout to stay alive  
They don't even have policeman one  
Doesn't matter where you been or what you've done  
  
Do you have a dark spot on your past  
Leave it to my man he'll fix it fast  
Pepe has a scar from ear to ear  
He will make your mug shots disappear  
  
[Chorus]  
You zombie  
Be born again my friend  
Won't you sign in stranger  
  
Do you like to take a yo-yo for a ride  
Zombie I can see you're qualified  
Walk around collecting Turkish union dues  
They will call you sir and shine your shoes  
  
Or maybe you would like to see the show  
You'll enjoy the Cafe D'Escargot  
Folks are in a line around the block  
Just to see her do the can-can-Jacques  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love or leave her, yellow fever  
Sure, it's all in the game  
And who are you  
Just another scurvy brother  
  
[Chorus]

Out on the fringe  
Where the shallows meet the scratchlands  
Out where hope and the highway ends  
You can park or cruise  
Both ways you lose  
This is Flytown now my friend  
  
You take a walk on Bleak Street  
Tonight could be the night you crash  
Then you turn and stop  
Start to finger pop  
You think you hear a wailin' combo  
You climb a flight of twisted stairs  
Some cat says buddy  
  
[Chorus]  
If you've got eyes  
To rhythmatize  
Bring your flat hat and your ax  
Cause tonight at ten  
We'll be workin' again  
At the Teahouse on the Tracks  
  
The Siegel Bros. were slammin' out a baion  
So slick it should have been a crime  
Irene and Flocko and little Amy Khan  
Lead off the big front line  
The crowd was bouncin' in sync with the pulse  
You get a case of party feet  
(Then the room turns bright  
And fills up with light)  
And then from somewhere deep inside you  
Some frozen stuff begins to crack  
Better hurry  
  
Chorus:  
Take the T-Line to Bleak and Divine  
Just above the Good Time Flats  
It's your last chance  
To learn how to dance  
At the Teahouse on the Tracks  
  
On Sunday morning  
You're back at the wheel  
You're feelng calm and crisp and strong  
  
Chorus:  
If it feels right  
Just drive for the light  
That's the groovessential facts  
Someday we'll all meet at the end of the street  
At the Teahouse on the Tracks

Any news was good news  
And the feeling was bad at home  
I was out of mind and you  
Were on the phone  
Lonnie was the kingpin  
Back in nineteen sixty-five  
I was singing this song  
When Lonnie came alive  
  
[Chorus]  
Bring back the Boston Rag  
Tell all your buddies  
That it ain't no drag  
Bring back the Boston Rag  
  
You were Lady Bayside  
There was nothing that I could do  
So I pointed my car down  
Seventh Avenue  
Lonnie swept the playroom  
And he swallowed up all he found  
It was forty-eight hours til  
Lonnie came around  
  
[Chorus]

I recall when I was small  
How I spent my days alone  
The busy world was not for me  
So I went and found my own  
I would climb the garden wall  
With a candle in my hand  
I'd hide inside a hall of rock and sand  
On the stone an ancient hand  
In a faded yellow-green  
Made alive a worldly wonder  
Often told but never seen  
Now and ever bound to labor  
On the sea and in the sky  
Every man and beast appeared  
A friend as real as I  
  
[Chorus]  
Before the fall when they wrote it on the wall  
When there wasn't even any Hollywood  
They heard the call  
And they wrote it on the wall  
For you and me we understood  
  
Can it be this sad design  
Could be the very same  
A wooly man without a face  
And a beast without a name  
Nothin' here but history  
Can you see what has been done  
Memory rush over me  
Now I step into the sun  
  
[Chorus]

No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on  
Oh no  
No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on  
Oh no  
That's what I am  
Please understand  
I want to be your holy man  
No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on  
Oh no  
Ain't never gonna do it without the fez on  
Oh no  
That's what I am  
Please understand  
I want to be your holy man  
  
No I'm never gonna do it without the fez on  
Oh no  
Don't make me do it without the fez on  
Oh no  
That's what I am please understand

Attention all shoppers  
It's cancellation day  
Yes the big adios  
Is just a few hours away  
  
It's last call  
To do your shopping  
At the last mall  
  
You'll need the tools for survival  
And the medicine for the blues  
Sweet treats and surprises  
For the little buckaroos  
  
It's last call  
To do your shopping  
At the last mall  
  
We've got a sweetheart sunset special  
On all of the standard stuff  
Cause in the morning, that gospel morning  
You'll have to do for yourself when the going gets tough  
  
Roll your cart back up the aisle  
Kiss the checkout girls goodbye  
Ride the ramp to the freeway  
Beneath the blood orange sky  
  
It's last call  
To do your shopping  
At the last mall

And they wandered in  
From the city of St. John  
Without a dime  
Wearing coats that shined  
Both red and green  
Colors from their sunny island  
From their boats of iron  
They looked upon the promised land  
Where surely life was sweet  
On the rising tide  
To New York City  
Did they ride into the street  
See the glory  
Of the royal scam  
  
They are hounded down  
To the bottom of a bad town  
Amid the ruins  
Where they learn to fear  
An angry race of fallen kings  
Their dark companions  
While the memory of  
Their southern sky was clouded by  
A savage winter  
Every patron saint  
Hung on the wall, shared the room  
With twenty sinners  
  
See the glory  
Of the royal scam  
  
By the blackened wall  
He does it all  
He thinks he's died and gone to heaven  
Now the tale is told  
By the old man back home  
He reads the letter  
How they are paid in gold  
Just to babble in the back room  
All night and waste their time  
And they wandered in  
From the city of St. John without a dime  
  
See the glory  
Of the royal scam

I don't mind the quiet  
Or the lonely nights  
I don't miss the funky attitudes  
And I don't miss the fights  
I lie on the couch 'till suppertime  
And hunker down and read the Post  
And that's when I remember the things I miss the most:  
  
The talk  
The sex  
Somebody to trust  
The Audi TT  
The house on the Vineyard  
The house on the gulf coast  
These are the things I miss the most  
  
I kinda like frying up  
My sad cuisine  
Gettin' in bed and curling up with a girlie magazine  
But sometimes in the corner of my eye  
I see that adorable ghost  
And then baboom I remember the things I miss the most  
  
The talk  
The sex  
Somebody to trust  
The comfy Eames chair  
The good copper pans  
The '54 Strat  
These are the things I miss the most  
  
I had a little birdy friend  
By morning she was gone  
Birdy good-bye  
Birdy bye-bye  
  
I'm learning how to meditate  
So far so good  
I'm building the Andrea Doria out of balsa wood  
The days really don't last forever  
But it's getting pretty damn close  
And that's when I remember the things I miss the most:  
  
The talk  
The sex  
Somebody to trust  
The Audi TT  
The house on the Vineyard  
The house on the gulf coast  
These are the things I miss the most

Johnny's playroom  
Is a bunker filled with sand  
He's become a third world man  
Smoky Sunday  
He's been mobilized since dawn  
Now he's crouching on the lawn  
He's a third world man  
  
Soon you'll throw down your disguise  
We'll see behind those bright eyes  
By and by  
When the sidewalks are safe  
For the little guy  
  
I saw the fireworks  
I believed that I was dreaming  
Till the neighbors came out screaming  
He's a third world man  
  
Soon you'll throw down your disguise  
We'll see behind those bright eyes  
By and by  
When the sidewalks are safe  
For the little guys  
  
When he's crying out  
I just sing that Ghana Rondo  
E l'era del terzo mondo  
He's a third world man

What is the meaning  
Of the morning rain?  
I got a feeling  
It's no good  
I waited for my baby  
But she never made the train  
Now I'm hoping  
At the next stop she will be there  
She'll catch my eye  
And satisfy my every care  
This seat's been taken  
Don't ask me where she's coming from  
You're quite mistaken  
You know she's gonna be here  
I know she's gonna come  
She must have a reason  
I will understand  
I know she'll turn up  
By and by  
I'll see her standing  
With a suitcase in her hand  
And she'll tell me  
How she couldn't find a pay 'phone  
She'll start to cry  
I'll realize I'm not alone

Lost in the Barrio I walk like an Injun  
So Carlo won't suspect something's wrong here  
I dance in place  
And paint my face  
And act like I belong here  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw back the little ones  
And pan-fry the big ones  
Use tact, poise and reason  
And gently squeeze them  
  
Hot licks and rhetoric  
Don't count much for nothing  
Be glad if you can use what you borrow  
So I pawn my crown  
For a ride uptown  
And buy it back tomorrow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Done like a matador I pray for the weekend  
And hope the little girls still throw roses  
Else I'll change my bait  
And move upstate  
Before the season closes  
  
[Chorus]

Son you better be ready for love  
On this glory day  
This is your chance to believe  
What I've got to say  
  
Keep your eyes on the sky  
Put a dollar in the kitty  
Don't the moon look pretty  
  
Tonight when I chase the dragon  
The water will change to cherry wine  
And the silver will turn to gold  
Time out of mind  
  
I am holding the mystical stone  
It's direct from Lasa  
Where people are rolling in the snow  
Far from the world we know  
  
Children we have it right here  
It's the light in my eyes  
It's perfection and grace  
It's the smile on my face  
  
Tonight when I chase the dragon  
The water will change to cherry wine  
And the silver will turn to gold  
Time out of mind  
  
Children we have it right here  
It's the light in my eyes  
It's perfection and grace  
It's the smile on my face  
  
Tonight when I chase the dragon  
the water will change to cherry wine  
And the silver will turn to gold  
Time out of mind

With stocking face I bought a gun  
The plan was set the plan was done  
Looked at my watch and started for the door  
Now the food here ain't so good no more  
And they closed the package store  
  
[Chorus]  
Love your mama, love your brother  
Love 'em till they run for cover  
Turn the light off, keep your shirt on  
Cry a jag on me  
  
Oh Michael Oh Jesus you know I'm not to blame  
You know my reputation for playing a good clean game  
Oh Michael Oh Jesus I'll keep my promise when  
You turn that heartbeat over again  
  
My poison's named you know my brand  
So please make mine a double, Sam  
Stir it up nice I'll eat it right here  
This highway runs from Paraguay  
And I've just come all the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We warned the corpse of William Wright  
Not to cuss and drink all night  
Ticket in hand I saw him laid to rest  
But zombie see and zombie do  
He's here with me and you  
  
[Chorus]

Bad news breaking in 18A  
Missy's Kitty turn inside out she say  
Spider queen demon and that whole crew  
Across the lobby the wicker wing chair flew  
  
All the nice people those goodly souls  
Quaking in their respective hidey holes  
Everyone's wasted in this gruesome dream  
Not a one of them left to hear you scream  
  
[Chorus]  
Two against nature don't you know  
Who's gonna grok the shape of things to go  
Two against nature make them groan  
Who's gonna break the shape of things unknown  
  
Madame Erzulie she come last night  
Bang you silly but leave a nasty bite  
There on your nightstand much worse than that  
Panatella and old black derby hat  
  
Call your doctor, call your shrink  
Western science she strictly rinky dink  
They all masissi but we hang tough  
Apsatively gonna help you beat that stuff  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Two against nature tan and lean  
Puttin' big heat on skanky things unseen  
Two against nature slinging dread  
These boys want to bang the skulls of things undead  
  
T-Bone Angie she champion liar  
Sew the mouth shut with rusty chicken wire  
Brother Lou Garue and the Jerry Garry  
Sprinkling chicken water gonna hush all three  
  
Beautiful housewife in deep distress  
'Specially you deserve the very best  
Two against nature they got that stuff  
Good things happening when you see about us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Two against nature love this gig  
Pull up the weeds before they're too damn big  
Two against nature stand alone  
Who's gonna chase the shape of things unknown  
  
Two against nature don't you know  
Who's gonna drop the boom on things to go  
Two against nature make them groan  
Gonna go bang-zoom to the moon on things unknown  
  
Scrape the wallboards the whole damn batch  
Catch the maggoty eggs before they hatch  
Pepper and ratbone make damn sure  
Shake the rubbish out on the patio floor  
  
Soak the timber with special spray  
Nuke the itty bitty ones right where they lay  
Whip the bastards while they still green  
Take the firemop, sweep it kissing clean

Hey people  
I can't seem to make up my mind  
Cause I'm undecided  
You're the reason why  
My delay is just a way of telling you that I  
I love you  
Go away  
I hate you  
No please stay  
I want you  
I'm so undecided  
So divided inside of me  
Hey baby  
Suddenly I found that my whole world is turned upside down  
And I'm broken hearted  
I confess the crime  
Who can free this heart of me?  
Till then I know  
That I  
[Chorus]  
[Solo]  
[Chorus (2x)]

I was grinding through my day gig  
Stackin' cutouts at the Strand  
When in walks Franny from NYU  
We were quite an item back then  
  
We talked about her films and shows and CDs  
And I don't know what else  
She said yeah Hollywood's been good to me  
But tell me how about yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm still working on that novel  
But I'm just about to quit  
Cause I'm worrying about the future now  
Or maybe this is it  
It's not all that I thought it would be  
What a shame about me  
  
She said, talk to me, do you ever see  
Anybody else from our old crew  
Bobby Dakine won the Bunsen Prize  
Now he's coming out with something new  
  
Alan owns a chain of Steamer Heavens  
And Barry is the software king  
And somebody told me in the early 80's  
You were gonna be the 'next big thing'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well now that was just a rumor  
But I guess I'm doin' fine  
Three weeks out of the rehab  
Living one day at a time  
Sneaking up on the new century  
What a shame about me  
  
What a shame about me  
I'm thinking of a major Jane Street sunrise  
And the goddess on the fire escape was you  
  
We both ran out of small talk  
The connection seemed to go dead  
I was about to say, hey, have a nice life  
When she touched my hand and said:  
  
You know I just had this great idea  
This could be very cool  
Why don't we grab a cab to my hotel  
And make believe we're back at our old school  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I said babe you look delicious  
And you're standing very close  
But like this is Lower Broadway  
And you're talking to a ghost  
Take a good look it's easy to see  
What a shame about me  
What a shame about me

I could be wrong but I have seen your face before  
You were the man that I saw running from his door  
You owed him money but you gave him something more  
With a gun  
With a gun  
  
You will be what you are just the same  
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand  
And leave him lying in the rain?  
  
You were the founders of the clinic on the hill  
Until he caught you with your fingers in the till  
He slapped your hand so you settled up your bill  
  
With a gun  
With a gun  
You will be what you are just the same  
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand  
And leave him lying in the rain?  
  
When you're born to play the fool  
And you've seen all the western movies  
Woe to the one who does you wrong  
You hide in the bushes  
Murder the man  
With Luger in hand  
  
I understood that you will soon be leavin' town  
Don't try to call me when they finally run you down  
Just give fair warning any time you come around  
  
With a gun  
With a gun  
You will be what you are just the same  
Did you pay the other man with the piece in your hand  
And leave him lying in the rain?

Got a feeling I've been here before  
Watching as you cross the killing floor  
You know you'll have to pay it all  
You'll pay today or pay tomorrow  
You fasten up your beaded gown  
Then you try to tie me down  
Do you work it out one by one  
Or played in combination  
You throw out your gold teeth  
Do you see how they roll  
I have seen your iron and your brass  
Can't you see it shine behind the glass  
Your fortune is your roving eye  
Your mouth and legs  
Your gift for the runaround  
Torture is the main attraction  
I don't need that kind of action  
You don't have to dance for me  
I've seen your dance before  
Do you throw out your gold teeth  
Do you see how they roll  
  
Tobacco they grow in Peking  
In the Year of the Locust  
You'll see a sad thing  
Even Cathy Berberian knows  
There's one roulade she can't sing  
Dumb luck my friend  
Won't suck me in this time  
  
Got a feeling I've been here before  
Won't you let me help you find the door  
All you got to do is use  
Your silver shoes  
A gift for the runaround  
Use your knack darlin'  
Take one step back darlin'  
There ain't nothing in Chicago  
For a monkey woman to do  
Do you throw out your gold teeth  
Do you see how they roll

Who are these children  
Who scheme and run wild  
Who speak with their wings  
And the way that they smile  
What are the secrets  
They trace in the sky  
And why do you tremble  
Each time they ride by  
  
[Chorus]  
Throw out your gold teeth  
And see how they roll  
The answer they reveal  
Life is unreal  
  
Who are these strangers  
Who pass through the door  
Who cover your action  
And go you one more  
If you're feeling lucky  
You best not refuse  
It's your game the rules  
Are your own win or lose  
  
[Chorus]
