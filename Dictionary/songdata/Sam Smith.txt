[Verse 1:]  
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand  
But I still need love cause I'm just a man  
These nights never seem to go to plan  
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Why am I so emotional?  
No it's not a good look, gain some self control  
And deep down I know this never works  
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me

Oh yeah, mmm  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on your troubles will be out of sight, yeah  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on your troubles will be miles away, oh  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore, ah  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
They gather near to us once more, ooh  
  
Through the years we all will be together and  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bow, oh yeah, oh  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now, oh, oh  
  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
They gather near to us once more, oh, oh  
  
Through the years we all will be together and  
If the fates allow, oh yeah  
But 'til then we'll have to muddle through somehow,  
Oh yeah, oh, oh  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now,  
Ooh yeah, oh, ooh

[Verse 1]  
You and me we made a vow  
For better or for worse  
I can't believe you let me down  
But the proof's in the way it hurts  
  
For months on end I've had my doubts  
Denying every tear  
I wish this would be over now  
But I know that I still need you here  
  
[Chorus]  
You say I'm crazy  
Cause you don't think I know what you've done  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
  
[Verse 2]  
You've been so unavailable  
Now sadly I know why  
Your heart is unobtainable  
Even though lord knows you kept mine  
  
[Chorus]  
You say I'm crazy  
Cause you don't think I know what you've done  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
  
[Bridge]  
I have loved you for many years  
Maybe I am just not enough  
You've made me realize my deepest fear  
By lying and tearing us up  
  
[Chorus]  
You say I'm crazy  
Cause you don't think I know what you've done  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
I know I'm not the only one  
  
You say I'm crazy  
Cause you don't think I know what you've don  
But when you call me baby  
I know I'm not the only one  
I know I'm not the only one  
  
[Outro]  
I know I'm not the only one  
And I know...  
I know I'm not the only one

You know what I mean  
It's like walking in the heat all day, with no water  
It's like waiting for a friend  
Watching everybody else meet theirs, on that corner  
Or losing in an argument  
Although you're right, can't get your thoughts in order  
  
Still I refrain  
From talking at you, talking on  
You know me well  
I don't explain,  
  
But why the hell  
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?  
Wasting all my precious time  
Oh, the truth spills out  
And oooooo oh I've  
I've told you now  
  
You know what I mean  
Although I try my best, I still let down the team  
You're everything I want,  
Why should I resist when you are there for me?  
  
Should I refrain  
From talking at you, talking on  
You know me well  
I don't explain  
  
But why the hell  
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?  
Wasting all my precious time  
Oh the truth spills out  
And oooooo oh I've  
I've told you now  
  
I've told you now  
And I've told you now!  
And I've told you now!  
  
Still I refrain  
From talking at you, talking on  
You know me well  
I don't explain  
  
So why the hell  
Why do you think I come 'round here on my free will?  
Wasting all my precious time  
Why the hell  
Why do you think I come 'round here on my own will?  
Wasting all my precious time  
Oh, the truth spills out  
And oooooo oh I've  
I've told you now

[Verse 1]  
Yes I do, I believe  
That one day I will be where I was  
Right there, right next to you  
And it's hard, the days just seem so dark  
The moon, the stars are nothing without you  
Your touch, your skin, where do I begin?  
No words can explain the way I'm missing you  
Deny this emptiness, this hole that I'm inside  
These tears, they tell their own story  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong  
  
[Chorus]  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?  
And make sure you're alright  
I'll take care of you  
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm reaching out to you  
Can you hear my call?  
This hurt that I've been through  
I'm missing you, missing you like crazy  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Told me not to cry when you were gone  
But the feeling's overwhelming, it's much too strong  
  
[Chorus]  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you?  
And make sure you're alright  
I'll take care of you  
I don't want to be here if I can't be with you tonight  
  
[Outro]  
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side  
Lay me down tonight, lay me by your side  
Can I lay by your side, next to you, you-ou

[Verse 1]  
I don't have much to give but I don't care for gold  
What use is money when you need someone to hold?  
Don't have direction I'm just rolling down this road  
Waiting for you to bring me in from out the cold  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You'll never know the endless nights  
The rhyming of the rain  
Or how it feels to fall behind  
And watch you call his name  
  
[Chorus]  
Pack up and leave everything  
Don't you see what I can bring?  
Can't keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight terror free and I will give you all of me  
Just leave your lover, leave him for me  
Leave your lover, Leave him for me.  
  
[Verse 2]  
We sit in bars and raise our drinks to growing old  
I'm in love with you and you will never know,  
But if I can't have you I'll walk this life alone  
Spare you the rising storms and let the river flow  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You'll never know the endless nights  
The rhyming of the rain  
Or how it feels to fall behind and watch you call his name  
  
[Chorus]  
Pack up and leave everything  
Don't you see what I can bring?  
Can't keep this beating heart at bay  
Set my midnight terror free and I will give you all of me  
Leave your lover, leave him for me  
Leave your lover, leave him for me.

[Verse 1]  
He could be a sinner, or a gentleman  
He could be your preacher, when your soul is down  
He could be your lawyer on a witness stand but  
He'll never love you like I can, can  
  
He could be a stranger, you gave a second glance  
He could be a trophy, of a one night stand  
He could have your humour, but I don't understand cause  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can  
  
[Verse 2]  
A chance encounter of circumstance  
Baby he's a mantra, keeps your mind entranced  
He could be a silence in this mayhem, but then again  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
[Bridge]  
We both have demons, that we can't stand  
I love your demons, like devils can  
If you're still seeking an honest man  
Then stop deceiving lord please  
  
[Chorus]  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
  
Why are you looking down all the wrong roads  
When mine is the heart, with the soul for your soul  
There may be lovers who hold out their hands but  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can  
He'll never love you like I can, can, can

(Verse)  
My mind runs away to you  
With a thought I hope you'll see  
Can't see where it's wandered to  
But I know where it wants to be  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
I'm waiting patiently  
Though time is moving slow  
I have one vacancy  
And I wanted you to know  
  
(Chorus)  
That you're the one  
Designed for me  
A distant stranger  
That I will complete  
I know you're out there  
We're meant to be  
So keep your head down  
And make it to me  
Make it to me  
  
(Verse)  
So sick of this loneliness  
It seems such a waste of breath  
So much that I need to say  
So much to get off my chest  
  
(Pre-Chorus)  
I'm waiting patiently  
Though time is moving slow  
I have one vacancy  
And I wanted you to know  
  
(Chorus)  
That you're the one  
Designed for me  
A distant stranger  
That I will complete  
I know you're out there  
We're meant to be  
So keep your head down  
And make it to me  
Make it to me  
And make it to me  
Make it to me

[Verse 1]  
My funny valentine  
Sweet comic valentine  
You make me smile with my heart  
Your looks are laughable  
Unphotographable  
Yet your my favourite work of art  
  
[Bridge]  
Is your figure less than Greek?  
Is your mouth a little weak?  
When you open it to speak  
Are you smart?  
  
[Chorus]  
But don't change your hair for me  
Not if you care for me  
Stay little valentine, stay  
Each day is valentine's day

[Verse 1]  
  
And I hate to say I love you  
When it's so hard for me  
And I hate to say I want you  
When you make it so clear  
You don't want me  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd never ask you cause deep down  
I'm certain I know what you'd say  
You'd say I'm sorry believe me  
I love you but not in that way  
  
[Verse 2]  
And I hate to say I need you  
I'm so reliant  
I'm so dependant  
I'm such a fool  
When you're not there  
I find myself singing the blues  
Can't bear  
Can't face the truth  
  
[Bridge]  
You will never know that feeling  
You will never see through these eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd never ask you  
Cause deep down I'm certain I know what you'd say  
You'd say I'm sorry  
Believe me  
I love you  
But not in that way  
  
You'd say I'm sorry  
Believe me  
I love you  
But not in that way

[Verse 1]  
I've got to get out of here  
This town's no longer fun  
And I'm falling closer, falling closer  
Closer to the sun  
I've got to get out of here  
Come kiss another face  
Cause it hurts too bad, it hurts too bad  
And I don't like the taste  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You say it's over, leaving me so far from sober  
Now sun is colder, I lean on a stranger's shoulder  
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder  
Without a trace I'm under  
  
[Chorus]  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've got to get out of here  
Cause you never want me back  
You are moving on, moving on  
And I'm stuck on the track  
I've gotta get out of here  
Before I self-destruct  
And I don't want, I don't want  
My heart to ever stop  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I walk the streets and there are beats and cities smoulder  
Without a trace I'm under  
  
[Chorus]  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you  
  
And God knows I try  
Looking for lovers at night  
But each time I do  
It only reminds me of you  
It only reminds me of you

I've been here before  
But always hit the floor  
I've spent a lifetime running  
And I always get away  
But with you I'm feeling something  
That makes me want to stay  
  
I'm prepared for this  
I never shoot to miss  
But I feel like a storm is coming  
If I'm gonna make it through the day  
Then there's no use in running  
This is something I gotta face  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall?  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall  
  
A million shards of glass  
That haunt me from my past  
As the stars begin to gather  
And the light begins to fade  
When all hope begins to shatter  
Know that I won't be afraid  
  
If I risk it all  
Could you break my fall?  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall  
  
The writing's on the wall  
  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
How do I live? How do I breathe?  
When you're not here I'm suffocating  
I want to feel love, run through my blood  
Tell me is this where I give it all up?  
For you I have to risk it all  
Cause the writing's on the wall

[Verse 1:]  
Guess it's true, I'm not good at a one-night stand  
But I still need love 'cause I'm just a man  
These nights never seem to go to plan  
I don't want you to leave, will you hold my hand?  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
'Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love, it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Why am I so emotional?  
No, it's not a good look, gain some self-control  
And deep down I know this never works  
But you can lay with me so it doesn't hurt  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
'Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love, it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
'Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love, it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh, won't you stay with me?  
'Cause you're all I need  
This ain't love, it's clear to see  
But darling, stay with me
