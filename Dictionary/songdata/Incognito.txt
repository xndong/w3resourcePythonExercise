Used to be too carefree  
I wish that I knew then what I know now  
Cos I wasn't on the ground the first time around  
So caught up in me that I missed you baby  
  
No there's no forgetting, everyday regretting  
All I think about is you, it drives me crazy  
  
I want you (All I want is you baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
  
Thinkin' about Sunday walks with you baby and bedroom talks  
My imagination's wild, takes over me  
Let's go on a ride, find a place to hide  
I know, no one does it better than you baby  
  
No there's no forgetting, everyday regretting  
Oh when I think about is you, drivin' me crazy  
  
I want you (All I want is you baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
I want you (Yes you know what I want baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
  
No there's no forgetting, everyday regretting  
(No there's no forgetting)  
  
I want you (All I want is you baby)  
All I want is you  
I want you (All I want is you)  
  
If I could make time last forever  
I would turn the seconds into years  
And I promise you one thing for sure  
I would spend them all with you  
  
I want you baby yes I do  
All I want is you  
You're all that I want baby  
I want you

(chorus)  
The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
  
Why didn't you hear me  
All the times I told you that love was gone  
No you never heard me  
'Cause I know there was too much on your mind  
  
(refrain)  
Runnin' around in a circle, (tryin' to catch up to myself)  
Runnin' out of time  
Losin' myself in the darkness, (every time I played my hand)  
I was losin' every time  
I knew I'd given all that I could give  
That's why it had to end this way, (this way)  
  
[repeat chorus]  
  
I know that I hurt you  
At a time you needed me there  
Yes you did, yes I know (yes I know)  
But my heart had been broken  
And my mind was no longer there  
I had to go, yes I did  
  
[repeat refrain]  
  
[The leaves were down  
Long before the autumn winds arrived]  
Long before the autumn winds arrived  
[The leaves were down]  
Before the summer sun had gone  
[Long before the autumn winds arrived]  
I'm sorry that it had to be this way...  
  
Love was gone...  
  
[repeat chorus]

Here I sit and watch the crowds go by  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
But there's only one face I can see  
If only they would understand  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
I'd open the door and let him in  
  
Chorus:  
How long can I hide, what I'm feeling inside  
My love is a river, that's got to make its way into sea  
This feeling can't hide, Lord knows I've tried  
Beneath the surface  
Beneath the surface  
  
I try, though I know I'm hanging on a string  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
You're the only one thing on my mind  
Keeps floating to a distant shore  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
As I go on denying myself  
  
Chorus  
  
Oh, keeps turning round in my mind  
Oh, round and round in my mind  
  
Here I sit and watch the crowds go by  
Papa da papa papa yeah  
But there's only one face I can see  
  
Chorus x 2

No one can enslave anybody  
Who's got freedom, freedom of mind  
But what they sure as hell can do  
Is to put you in the grave  
'Cause they know you've got freedom of mind  
  
We need to be awaken to the new reality  
Keep the fires burning in our souls  
There are stages in our lives  
That we need to leave behind  
To keep the freedom of mind  
  
Gonna bring you down  
People bring you down  
Gonna bring you down  
Down, down, down  
Gonna bring you down  
If you don't stand your ground  
Gonna bring you down  
Down, down, down  
  
Damn it's a shame to work your fingers to the bone  
To barely, barely make a living  
And you wake up early mornings  
Don't come home 'till late  
It's a struggle  
In a jungle, jungle, jungle  
  
We all need to be awaken to the new reality  
Keep the fires burning in our souls  
There are stages in our lives  
We need to leave behind  
To keep the freedom of the mind

Castles in the air  
Dreamers everywhere  
Building castles in the air  
Like dreamers everywhere  
  
If you asked me as a child  
If I knew what I would be  
Today  
I would give you a reply  
Convinced of my destiny  
True to this day  
  
Music, music my first love  
Music I love  
You're all, all, all, All that I dream of  
Labour of my love  
  
If you want to know how it feels  
Look into the eyes of a child  
At play  
I make no excuse for my life  
'Cause I believe, I believe, I believe  
To dream is the way

If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if I were as blinded by the light  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if it were a, give me back my sight  
I will crave you tonight, I will crave you, come tomorrow  
I will crave you for always, time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you, back to you  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if the thunder strikes me down tonight  
If this ain't love  
I guess I'll never know it even if you kiss me in the broad daylight  
I will crave you tonight, I will crave you, come tomorrow  
I'll crave you for always, time brings me to the truth  
And the truth brings me back to you, back to you  
I will crave you, crave you, I will crave you  
(If this ain't love, ooh, oh)  
Crave you  
(If this ain't love)  
I will crave you  
(Crave you, crave you if this ain't love)  
Crave you  
(This ain't love, oh)  
I will crave you  
(This ain't love, crave you, yeah)  
Crave you  
(This ain't love, this ain't love)  

It's July but it's winter in your mind  
You've been down but never quite this way before  
  
It's a crime to watch the needle take another soul  
Look around see the poison killing people by the score  
  
You've got into something that's leading you nowhere, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
Getting deeper into something, that leaves you with nothing, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
  
Every time you escape into the wilderness  
You will find it's stolen just a little more of you  
  
You say you're fine, but it's only your imagination  
Such a shame, 'cause you've only got yourself to blame  
  
You've got into something that's leading you nowhere, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
Getting deeper into something, that leaves you with nothing, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
  
Such a shame, you've only got yourself to blame  
  
You've got into something that's leading you nowhere, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out  
Getting deeper into something, that leaves you with nothing, cut it loose  
Yeah, yeah, cut it loose, turn it out

Is it a crime  
For me to be feeling this way  
I'm going out of my mind  
And there's no change from my runaway love  
  
Is it a dream (Is it a dream)  
That I'm throwing in the wishing well  
I'm losin' control  
Body and soul (Body and soul)  
Standin' here waiting for a train that may never come  
  
I saw the signs  
I'd read the book  
I should have had a second look  
But, boy you caught me dreamin'  
And there were times you'd come around  
And we'd agree just to be friends  
Tell me who was foolin' who  
  
[Chorus]  
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in  
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper  
Deep waters, I'm drownin' in  
Deep waters, slowly drownin' in deeper  
  
What do I say, what can I say  
Where words have failed me before  
What do I do, when I'm feeling so blue  
And there's no place, for me to run and hide  
  
I saw the sun inside your smile  
And wished for more than just a while  
Cause, boy you caught me dreaming  
A giant step into the dark  
We threw caution to the wind  
Tell me who was fooling who  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(I'm drownin')  
(Deeper, deeper, deeper)  
(I'm drownin' in deeper)  
  
Oh, I saw the signs  
I read the book  
I should have had a second look  
'cause, boy you caught me dreamin'  
And there were times you'd come around  
And we'd agree just to be friends  
Tell me who was fooling, fooling who  
  
[Chorus]

(Do right)  
(Do right)  
  
Everytime I say  
Come closer my dear  
I need you to be by my side  
And every night I feel  
You're driftin' away  
Is there something you're trying to hide  
  
I can tell what it means  
That look in your eyes  
'Cause I've seen it before  
And it holds no surprise  
  
(Do me right)  
You've been holding me tight  
But your mind's on the new girl in town  
  
Now you know that you're lying  
And there's no use denying  
'Cause this is the time baby  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop (Hey)  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop  
  
All that I need from you  
Is that comes straight from the heart  
You have to be cruel to be kind  
And if I should lose you now  
I may hurt for a while  
But I'll leave all the sadness behind  
  
Life's not always the way that I want it to be  
But given the choice I would rather be free  
  
(Do me right)  
You've been holding me tight  
But your mind's on the new girl in town  
  
Now you know that you're lying  
So there's no use denying  
This is the time baby  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop (Hey)  
Bop ba dop bop ba dop bop ba dop  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me  
  
Do right  
(Baby do right by me)  
(Just want you to)  
Do right  
Baby do right by me

I don't want to spend my life trying to change you  
This time I'm gonna take it as it comes  
There are so many things that I want to ask you  
I am unafraid of what the answers may be  
  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo oooo  
Before you walk away  
And start burning any bridges  
Oooo oooo oooo oooo oooo  
This woman's not the one you knew  
There's been so many changes  
  
Please don't turn my love away  
(Don't turn my love away)  
I'm gonna love you like no one's ever done before  
Oh please don't turn your love away  
(Turn my love away)  
I'm gonna show you a love like you've never known  
  
We travel so many roads in a lifetime  
In search of a promise, (Promise of a dream come true)  
And now that I've found you  
Like a falling star falling from the midnight sky  
I've got to let you know  
  
(If only I knew then)  
If I knew then what I know now  
Babe I got no doubt that you'd be mine  
(Baby got no doubt that you'd be mine)  
No doubt in my mind you'd be mine  
  
Please don't turn my love away  
(Don't turn my love away)  
I'm gonna love you like no one's ever done before  
Oh please don't turn away my love away  
(Turn my love away)  
I'm gonna show you a love like you've never known  
  
Don't you turn away, run away and leave me this way  
Don't you turn away, don't you run away

(s. wonder)  
  
Everybody's got a thing  
But some don't know how to handle it  
Always reachin' out in vain  
Just taking the things not worth havin'  
  
  
  
Chorus:  
But don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (don't you worry, baby)  
'cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out  
  
They say your style of life's a drag  
And that you must go other places  
Just don't you feel too bad  
When you get fooled by smiling faces  
  
Chorus  
  
When you get off your trip  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
  
Chorus  
  
Everybody needs a change  
A chance to check out the new  
You're the only one who see  
The changes you take yourself through  
  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing (sweet baby)  
'cause I'll be standin' in the wings when you check it out  
  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't you worry 'bout a thing  
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry 'cause I'll be right here waitin' for
you baby  
Repeat (fade)

Life has cast a smile  
In this game of chance  
But you can't take for granted  
That you've got it all worked out  
  
Fool if you think there's nothing left to learn  
You got to get down, get down, get down  
Back down to earth  
  
How could you not know?  
There's quite a way to go  
The wheels won't stop from turning  
The chapters ever changing  
  
We can't allow ourselves to be blinded by pride  
We are so small in the plan of creation  
Gravitate, gravitate, gravitate  
Elevate, elevate, elevate  
Your mind  
  
So, you think there's nothing left to learn  
You got to get down, get down, get down  
Back down to earth  
  
There's a story of a man  
Who bragged he knew it all  
Arrogance outspoken  
He died alone and broken  
  
Fool if you think there's nothing left to learn  
You got to get down, get down, get down  
Back down to earth

My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine, hey  
Everybody loves the sunshine, ooh, ooh, sunshine, ooh yeah  
Everybody loves the sunshine, yeah, sunshine, hey  
Folks get down in the sunshine, ooh, ooh yeah  
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine, ooh  
Just bees and things and flowers  
Just bees and things and flowers, ooh  
Just bees and things and flowers, yeah  
Just bees and things and flowers, yeah  
My life, my life, my life, my life in the sunshine, hey  
Everybody loves the sunshine, ooh, hey, sunshine, yeah  
Folks get down in the sunshine, ooh, ooh yeah  
Sunshine, folks get down in the sunshine, ooh yeah  
Sunshine, folks get brown in the sunshine, yeah  
Feel, wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel  
What I'm feeling in the sunshine, yeah  
Feel, wanna feel, wanna feel, wanna feel  
What I'm feeling, yeah, in the sunshine  
Do what I do, what I do, what I do  
What I'm doing, yeah, in the sunshine, sunshine, hey  
Do what I do, what I do, what I do  
What I'm doing, yeah, in the sunshine, ooh yeah  
Sunshine yeah, everybody loves the sunshine, ooh, ooh, yeah  
Sunshine yeah, yeah, everybody loves the sunshine  
Yeah, yeah, oh oh yeah, sunshine, ooh  

Out in Rio, we strolled the Ipanema  
And headed for the samba  
How could we know, Just what would come at sunset  
The day we'll never forget  
  
With Sugar loaf in the distance fading  
We held the night, and it felt so right  
No greater feeling have I known  
Than to watch the sunrise in your eyes  
Sweet love  
  
Now I got this feeling, it's undenying  
Gonna give you everything your heart desires  
Yes I got the feeling, making me feel so good  
Gonna give you everything your heart desires  
  
Come with me now, let's take a flight to Mexico  
Something there I want to show you  
Lets take our wings like butterflies, together we can touch the skies  
Like Frida and Diego  
  
Through the deserts and the harsh lands baby  
I hold you tight, it feels so right  
No greater feeling have I known  
Than to watch the sunrise in your eyes  
Sweet love

Politicians knocking at my door  
Heads of nations rotten to the core  
Tell me how are you gonna change the world  
When you haven't got the love  
  
I still remember your promise from the past  
And here you are with another that won't last  
You tell me how you're gonna change the world  
When you haven't got the love  
  
Don't shake me by the hand  
Pretend to understand  
To get into my mind  
You got to get into my groove  
Step into my shoes  
Come and feel my blues  
To comprehend my life  
You got to get into my groove  
  
You say you're standing for the hungry and the weak  
But your words are as hollow as the glory that you seek  
Tell me how you're gonna change the world  
When you haven't got the love  
  
You want the world to see your point of view  
But your eyes are closed to the pain we must undo  
Tell me how you're gonna change the world  
When you haven't got the love  
  
Before you tell the world about the things that they should do  
Stop and take a look what's going on inside of you  
Divisions are the consequences of the games you play  
Look inside you

I've taken time to say goodbye to my sadness  
But now I know I'm free  
You took my hand and led me out of the darkness  
To help me find a brand new me (Baby)  
Though all the world around me criticized  
The love you gave was never compromised  
  
I never heard you say through all of the madness  
Maybe, maybe  
There's no denyin' I feel the same way too  
Baby, I would die for you (Yeah)  
I would (Die for you)  
With you I know I'm in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it all up to the feelin'  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Baby, I know you've got that somethin'  
(Givin it up)  
  
Learning the truth, that exposed me to my blindness  
Has opened up my world  
Gone are the barriers that kept me out in darkness  
Living in a twilight world  
You guided me, where others feared to tread  
And through it all no grudging words were said  
  
I never heard you say through all of this madness  
Maybe, maybe  
There's no denial I feel the same way too  
Honey, I would die for you  
I would (Die for you)  
With you I know I'm in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it all up to the feelin'  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
Give it up!  
I want to give it up!  
  
There's no denial I feel the same way too  
Baby, I would die for you (Yes)  
I would (Die for you)  
With you I know I'm in a place  
That darkness can not touch  
  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it all up to the feelin'  
Givin' it up  
Givin' it up  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
Babe, I know you've got that somethin'  
That's why, I'm givin' it all up to you, Baby!

There was a time when no one  
Could ever take your place  
[That's not the case anymore]  
Took for granted that tomorrow was ours to play  
  
Boy things have changed  
Nothing stayed the same  
When you chose to move away  
  
[Chorus]  
Haven't heard your voice in so very long  
Say I've been missed but I wouldn't know  
I might be better off living on my own  
'cause love won't last now that hope is gone  
Promised the distance wouldn't change a thing  
Now the fault is work, it's keeping you away  
You'd try harder if you want my love  
If you want my love  
  
Careless intentions  
Is what this has become  
[I'm struck with a broken heart]  
Here we're flowing on emotions  
Of what once was  
  
Boy things have changed  
Nothing stayed the same  
When you chose to move away  
[move away]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Looking back on how things used to be  
No one could tell me that this would be our destiny  
And now I'm facing life on my own without you baby  
Though we're miles apart - you had my heart  
  
I'm tired of the confusion I'd rather just be friends  
[There's no hope of a second chance]  
No sense in going through the motions  
Like it's not the end, like this is not the end

More of myself  
From the moment that we met  
I knew I wanna give all of myself to you  
Now wherever I may be  
I'd even brave the stormy sea  
Won't tarry on a shore  
That keeps me from your door  
'Cos I'm missing you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more from me to you  
More of myself  
I wanna give more of myself  
More of myself  
Every time I dream it's you, I find  
Running through the blossoms in my mind  
I know I'll love you endlessly  
Because the love you give to me  
Gets me to the core  
And leaves me wanting more  
'Cos I'm missing you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more from me to you  
More of myself  
I wanna give more of myself  
More of myself  
I gotta give more of myself  
Now wherever I may be  
I'd even brave the stormy sea  
Won't tarry on a shore  
That keeps me from your door  
'Cos I'm missing you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I gotta give more from me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more from me to you  
More, more, more of myself  
I wanna give more of me to you  
From me to you, more of myself  
I wanna give it  
I wanna give it to you, baby  
More of myself, more of myself  

Once our love was drifting  
I felt left out and alone  
There was nothing more that I could do  
I lost my hold on you  
  
And through it all I kept my faith  
In the good things from the past  
Then one day out of the blue  
You came back to me  
  
In time, everything changes  
Nothing stays the same  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
In time, everything changes  
Troubles disappear  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
  
Holding on to something  
'cause it feels so right  
You don't doubt it for a minute  
Day or night  
  
You know you've got to keep the faith  
Don't let it slip away  
Knew one day that you'd return  
And together we will stay  
  
In time, everything changes  
Nothing stays the same  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
In time, everything changes  
Troubles disappear  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
  
If we believe there's a future  
Take the time to remember  
That the setting sun will always rise again  
  
In time, everything changes  
Nothing stays the same  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun  
In time, everything changes  
Troubles disappear  
Goes 4 you, goes 4 me, goes 4 every 1  
We're like the morning sun

You've gotta be out of your mind  
If you think that I am the kind  
To sit around and wait  
Say you've got me all wrong  
If you think that I am gonna be here  
Should your plans not escalate  
  
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones  
Didn't I give you so much more  
Was it all for nothing  
Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones, Mr. Jones  
I can't give you any more  
Was it all for nothing  
  
Well I know she's got you hypnotised  
Cos you're sitting right here next to me  
But your heart is not around  
I wished that I had you all wrong  
But I know that it's time to step aside  
Hitch another ride  
I still got my pride  
  
You must be losing your mind  
If you think that I am the kind  
To sit around and wait

Out in the heat little child  
On the streets runnin' wild  
Barely ten, got a gun  
So now he thinks that he's a man  
Yes he does  
  
Teenage girl out to steal  
''cause her baby is in need of a meal  
Tryin' to cope as best she can  
In the high sunshine, low on hope  
  
Well, there it is summer in the city  
Tryin' to make sense of a world gone crazy  
  
[Chorus:]  
(du do do do do du)  
One hundred and risin'  
(du do do do do du)  
So the tale is told  
(du do do do do du)  
One hundred and risin'  
(du do do do do du)  
  
Old man sitting in the shade  
Won't take part in the charade  
He may be old, but he ain't a foo  
L he has seen how dreams are bought and sold  
  
On every corner, a steady stream  
To buy a thrill, a piper's dream  
While the heat takes its toll  
It's just another day on a city street  
  
You got to do the best you can to get by  
In the high sunshine  
  
[Chorus: x 3]  
Summer madness will unfold  
Tryin' to make sense of a world gone crazy  
Repeat (fade)

Before you go  
I'd like to say  
You give me so much satisfaction  
Started up a chain reaction  
Tryin' to work out in my mind  
A way to let you know  
Oh darling  
  
You're asking me to be strong  
But I can't see the wrong  
In what I'm doing  
Just want to hold you every day  
Locked inside this feeling  
I want you here to stay  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
What can I do  
But to be true  
I'm getting such a strong sensation  
And it's not my imagination  
It's not me to pretend  
So try and understand  
Oh darling  
  
My heart is chosen to belong  
And I don't see the wrong  
In what I'm feeling  
I know it's time to say goodbye  
But I'm not living in a lie  
I want you here to stay  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
Oh, baby  
You're asking me to be strong  
But I still can't see the wrong  
In what I'm doing  
Just want to hold you every day  
Locked? inside this feeling  
I want you here to stay  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
  
(Holding)  
'Cause I'm holding (I'm holding)  
I'm holding on  
To the pieces of a dream  
Holding  
I'm holding on (Still holding)  
Still holding on  
To the pieces of a dream

(Oh)  
(Get up face the power)  
(Oh, hey)  
  
It's early in the morning  
The light outside is blinding  
You don't want to know  
You're so tired of complainin'  
'Cause your nine to five ain't workin'  
While your dreams just seem to grow and grow  
  
Nothing's clear  
It's so confusin'  
Intuition's left you  
There's no one left to turn to  
Until you hear a voice within your heart  
Telling you which way to go (Don't you know)  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
Spend the days here waiting  
And all your nights in wishin'  
Seasons come and go  
As you sleep the tide is risin'  
One by one your dreams are drownin'  
While you stare and watch the waters flow  
  
Nothing's clear  
It's so confusin'  
Intuition's left you  
There's no one left to turn to  
Until you hear a voice within your heart  
Telling you which way to go (Don't you know)  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
Don't spend your days  
Watching the way  
(Face the power)  
(Got to please your mind)  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity  
  
You have got to learn to please your mind  
Positively (Oh)  
Tryin' to find a way to spend your time  
In positivity

Shinin' like the noon day sun  
You gave me a fever  
Hypnotized under your spell  
Caught in a rapture  
  
There's no use in denyin'  
That much is true  
There's no other way to say it  
I'd die for you  
  
[Chorus]  
Whatever you desire  
Child?  
I give my all to you  
Tell me what you desire  
Oh child?  
I promise you the moon  
  
Late at night with Quincy and Gershwin  
It's stronger than ever  
This feeling inside  
When you're holdin' me baby  
  
So what's the use in denyin'  
You know that it is true  
There's no other way to say it (No)  
I love for you (Only you)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no use in denyin'  
I'd die for you

There's a sky in the east  
Over pyramids at Giza  
Where there once lived a girl  
She ruled the world  
Then down the nile  
He came with a smile  
He was the king  
She was the queen  
Under the moonlight  
Your eyes won't believe  
What your mind can't concieve  
  
Oooh  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Incense and myrrh  
And girls that swirl  
To the music  
Nights over Egypt  
  
Women fellahin  
Wear veils to been seen  
By no one  
Take a caravan across  
The sudan  
Saharan fagade  
Is just a mirage  
Oasis in the sand  
Where life once began  
Under the moonlight  
Your eyes won't believe  
What your mind can't concieve  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt  
Nights over Egypt

Raise, your voice out into the universe  
Raise, your mind beyond the planets and the sun  
Raise, where there is need, you'll find us there  
Raise, spread the message everywhere  
The dawning of the ages has just began  
Ooh, oh yes, raise your voice out into the universe, oh yes, ooh oh  
Stand, stand tall, head up high above the traitors call  
We come in numbers seeking peace for one and all  
Our history, if nothing else has taught us that we're wrong  
When we destroy, destroy the place where we belong  
Raise, your voice out into the universe  
Raise, your mind beyond the planets and the sun  
Raise, where there is need, you'll find us there

When we destroy, destroy the place where we belong  

If you're willing to listen, I got a message for you  
Gather everybody, together there's nothing we can't do  
We must use love inspiration to elevate our minds  
Spread the information to the corners of the world  
Reach out  
You'll be amazed what you find  
When you reach out with your mind  
Reach out  
  
You're gonna find so much more  
Won't you reach out and explore  
If you are searching for something to lead you out of the dark  
Light the inner fire, if you believe it will see you through  
We must use love inspiration to elevate your mind  
Spread the information to the corners of the world  
Reach out  
  
You'll be amazed what you find  
When you reach out with your mind  
Reach out  
You're gonna find so much more  
Won't you reach out and explore  
We are one under the sun

There were moments in my past  
I couldn't tell right from wrong  
Getting lost along the way in places I did not belong  
I couldn't see a way to turn myself around  
so deep my confusion  
Until the day you woke up my senses  
showed me happiness was not just an illusion  
Since you came into my life  
  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Stay mine, stay mine  
Getting by just on my own  
Always been my intention  
Now sitting here waiting by the phone  
  
I realize how much I needed this emotion  
Every time I get the chance I'm gonna let you know  
how you complete me  
I put away all my defenses  
all the love I got  
I give to you completely  
Since you came into my life  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Stay mine, stay mine, got to stay mine  
Now you've got to know, you're the top of my list  
One the one the one the one, my number one  
There's no doubt in my mind, baby you're the one  
One the one the one the one the one  
Since you came into my life  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Ever since you came into my life  
I've been caught in a world of ecstasy  
For the first time in all my days  
I feel like I'm walking on solid ground  
Stay mine, stay mine, got to stay mine  
stay mine, sugar honey baby  
One the one the one, my number one  
One the one the one the one the one

Ba da dwee ba dibbe da dwee

Early morning melody floating  
My heart is calling  
Wanting you needing you  
Ba da dwee ba dibbe da dwee  
  
Cool and brezzy (Dibi de di dibbi de dwea)  
Blue horizons in my mind flowing (Ba da dwee ba dibbe da dwee)

Step into my life

All along, you did nothing wrong  
Still I'm missing something strong  
And I feel I don't belong, Oh no  
What should I do?  
But tell the truth  
  
'Cause it's been eating me away  
And I'm burning just to say  
That we can't go on this way, oh no  
What should I do? What can I do?  
  
And now I wish that I  
Could give you more, than a stone cold heart  
I wish that somebody would have told me  
Then this would have been unnecessary  
You're asking me why, but I just can't lie  
You gave me more, than a stone cold heart  
In a million years I never, ever thought we'd have to end this way  
  
Now we've come this far and we  
Find it hard to just be friends, and it's better if we end this way  
I don't wanna lead you on no more

Hot town, summer in the city, back of my neck getting dirty and gritty  
Been down, isn't it a pity, doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city  
All around, people looking half dead  
Walking on the sidewalk, hotter than a match head  
  
But at night it's a different world, so nice just to be a girl  
Come on and dance all night despite the heat it will be alright  
And baby, don't you know it's a pity  
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer  
In the city, in the summer, in the city  
  
Cool town, evening in the city, dressing so fine and looking so pretty  
Cool cat, looking for a kitty, gonna look in every corner of the city  
Till I'm wheezing just like a bus stop  
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop  
  
But at night it's a different world, so nice just to be a girl  
Come on and dance all night despite the heat it will be alright  
And baby, don't you know it's a pity  
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer  
In the city, in the summer, in the city  
  
Hot town, summer in the city, back of my neck getting dirty and gritty  
Been down, isn't it a pity, doesn't seem to be a shadow in the city  
Till I'm wheezing just like a bus stop  
Running up the stairs, gonna meet you on the rooftop  
  
But at night it's a different world, so nice just to be a girl  
Come on and dance all night despite the heat it will be alright  
And baby, don't you know it's a pity  
That the days can't be like the nights in the summer  
In the city, in the summer, in the city

It's the principle of love  
It's the principle of life  
  
When you shut your soul  
You're so hard to find  
And there's no light in my life  
  
When you come to me  
And open up your heart  
It's a joyful time in my mind  
  
Finding and losing, Hurting and healing  
Let's get it on, get it on now  
Yearning and learning, breaking, creating  
Let's get it on, get it on, get it on  
It's the principle of love  
It's the principle of life  
  
It's easy to forget  
So caught up in ourselves  
That we're not the only ones  
(Not the only ones)  
  
Trouble finds us all  
But love can break the fall  
Time and time and time again  
  
I've taken time to say goodbye to my sadness  
Now I know I'm free  
You took my hand, led me out of the darkness  
Help me find a brand new me  
  
It's the principle of love  
It's the principle of life

Sometimes I'm walking down the street, with my head in the clouds  
I can't see what stands before me, I can't feel the walls around me  
I'm lost in a daydream  
A place where every child could be runnin' wild, running free  
It feels so natural, could it be possible for this to be?  
Make a wish on a star, that our troubles won't last forever  
Now that we've come so far, I believe that we can make it all the way  
A place where everyone can feel love happiness  
I know, can't be far away  
  
Where every woman child and man need never be oppressed  
I know there will come a day  
There will come a day, there comes a day, there will come a day  
Yes I've been down on my Knees, with my head to the sky  
Hoping this world divided, will make a stand united  
Oh happy day  
We've seen the future within' the past, the price of closin' our eyes  
Let's turn this situation, with love and education  
Let's find a way  
  
Make a wish on a star, that our troubles won't last forever  
Now that we've come so far, I believe that we can make it all the way  
A place where everyone can feel, love happiness  
I know, can't be far away  
Every woman, child, and man, need never be oppressed  
I know, there will come a day  
A place where everyone can feel, love and happiness  
I know, can't be far away  
  
Where every woman, child and man won't be oppressed  
I know, there will come a day  
There will come a day, there comes a day, there will come a day  
There will come a day, there comes a day, there will come a day  
We got to know and understand , we are vital to the master plan  
So get ready for the fight as we proceed into the light  
Get ready for the fight, for what is right

Things are not always what they appear to be  
Beneath the calm exterior  
There can be a soul on fire  
  
Truth is not always what the eyes can see  
The smile upon our faces  
Can disguise our pain and hide the traces  
  
Sometimes the rock that we depend on  
Melts into the ground and disappears  
The one thing you thought was forever  
Slowly washed away by all the tears  
  
If I gotta be true to no other  
I gotta be true to myself  
  
Raise up your head now so the world can see  
You have the inner vision  
Though the fight is far from over  
  
You've got to battle with it endlessly  
Before life becomes a rumor  
A sudden risin' tide that pulls you under  
  
Sometimes the rock that we depend on  
Melts into the ground and disappears  
The one thing you thought was forever  
Slowly washed away by all the tears  
  
If I gotta be true to no other  
I gotta be true to myself  
  
(True to myself)  
(True to myself)  
  
If I'm gonna make it come tomorrow  
(True to myself)  
Hallowed be the voice of constant sorrow  
(True to myself)  
Gotta climb the ladder if I'm able  
(True to myself)  
I can't keep this shining light under the table, my love  
(True to myself)  
I wanna be, I gotta be true to myself, hey, hey'  
(True to myself)
