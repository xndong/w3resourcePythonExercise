In troubled times  
It's hard to get straight answers  
Between the lines  
That border wrong or right  
The homeland cries  
It struggles with confusion  
But this feelin' still remains  
Like shelter from the rain  
  
We live of faith  
In the hands of those who guide us  
And tear the page  
On the fear we left behind  
We set the pace  
For every born survivor  
Don't turn the other way  
When I need to hear you say  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice  
I only need your voice  
To tell me you care  
I'll be anywhere for you, allies  
  
We search our hearts  
To justify the reason  
And draw the line  
To meet somewhere halfway  
If faith is blind  
Through darkness it will guide us  
'Cause the spirit still remains  
With the keepers of the flame  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice  
I only need your voice  
To tell me you care  
I'll be anywhere for you, allies  
  
Allies with our backs against the wall  
I will answer when you call  
And take on the odds  
For what we believe is true  
Allies in a world of too much choice  
I only need your voice  
To tell me you care  
I'll be anywhere for you, allies

I thought that dreams belonged to other men  
'Cause each time I got close, they'd fall apart again  
I thought my heart would beat in secrecy  
I faced the nights alone, oh how could I have known?  
That all my life I only needed you  
  
Woah, almost paradise  
We're knocking on heaven's door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more?  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes,  
Paradise  
  
It seems that perfect love's so hard to find  
I'd almost given up, you must have read my mind  
And all these dreams I save for a rainy day  
They're finally coming true, I'll share them all with you  
'Cause now we hold the future in our hands  
  
Woah, almost paradise  
We're knocking on heaven's door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more?  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes,  
Paradise  
  
And in your arms salvation's not so far away  
It's getting closer, closer every day  
  
Almost paradise  
We're knocking on heaven's door  
Almost paradise  
How could we ask for more?  
I swear that I could see forever in your eyes,  
Paradise  
Paradise  
Paradise

I hear the ticking of the clock  
I'm lying here the room's pitch dark  
I wonder where you are tonight  
No answer on the telephone  
And the night goes by so very slow  
Oh I hope that it won't end though  
Alone  
  
Till now I always got by on my own  
I never really cared until I met you  
And now it chills me to the bone  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
You don't know how long I have wanted  
To touch your lips and hold you tight, oh  
You don't know how long I have waited  
And I was going to tell you tonight  
But the secret is still my own  
And my love for you is still unknown  
Alone  
  
Oh Oh Oh  
Till now I always got by on my own  
I never really cared until I met you  
And now it chills me to the bone  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
How do I get you alone  
How do I get you alone  
  
Alone, alone

There are times in your life they take you by surprise  
You and I, I know we can talk about it  
You're important to me like the air that I breathe  
You and me, I know we can talk about it  
  
When my conscience comes undone I unfold and morning comes  
I know you're my friend, hold on and transcend  
I know anything is possible, I don't ask for much  
Just show who you are and I'll know anything is possible  
There's a shadow of doubt turning you inside out  
What you reveal can make you so strong  
  
Tell me where is the proof?  
Does it lie in the truth?  
I believe we can be anyone  
  
When my conscience comes undone I unfold and morning comes  
I know you're my friend, hold on and transcend  
I know anything is possible, I don't ask for much  
Just show who you are and I'll know anything is possible  
  
I want to know you  
I want to feel you  
I know you're my friend, hold on and transcend  
I know anything is possible, I don't ask for much  
Just show who you are, then I'll know anything is possible

I knew a woman  
Never knew no one like her  
She said, "The world's made up of angels  
Beautiful and fair"  
She would give you anything  
Just give it all away  
Just for one true moment  
Believing love would stay  
You're a bright light girl  
Shine into this world  
Now you know your love is coming true  
You're a bright light girl  
In a disbelieving world  
Now someone believes as much as you  
And now you know he really loves you too  
She opened up for trouble  
And saw him come on strong  
But when he could not meet her eyes  
She thought she'd done it wrong  
Each time love abused her  
She would take the shame  
Each time love would lose her  
She would take the blame  
No, you're a bright light girl  
Shine into this world  
Now you know your love is coming true  
Bright light girl  
In a disbelieving world  
Now someone believes as much as you  
And now you know he really loved you too  
You never lost your magic vision  
Always in your sight  
Special intuition  
Telling you, it's gonna be alright  
Oh, yeah, you're a bright light girl  
Shine into this world  
Now you know your love is coming true  
You're a bright light girl  
In a disbelieving world  
Now someone believes as much as you  
And now somebody really loves you too  
Come on, shine on  
Shine on girl

After midnight  
I call you  
Even though I know better  
I just got to  
The moon is full  
My heart is hot  
And you know what I'm longing to do  
With this aching I got  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby, can't you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
The call of the wild  
  
How can you ask me  
Why I'm pushing pushing  
When you know damn well  
What you do  
What you do to a woman  
I get so inspired  
Lying so close  
It's the flash and the flame and the lever  
I need the most  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby, can't you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
The call of the wild  
  
If I could chain you to me  
I'd do it in a minute  
My magic caravan  
Baby you'd be in it  
I'm hiding the prize and you're gonna win it  
You're gonna win it now  
  
The call of the wild  
Oh baby, can't you hear me calling  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
Oh  
The call of the wild  
Oh  
Oh Baby  
Listen to me howling  
  
The call of the wild

This hot night wind is mine, I know  
This gust of love ain't no liar  
Steamed up, blown up, stoked from below  
I'm a ready to cook with fire  
  
She cattin' around to catch you, man  
And butters you up to buy her  
Darling, she's just a flash in the pan.  
Don't you want to cook with fire?  
  
I'm talkin' 'bout kickin' the role  
I want to give you whole thing  
Yes, she gonna burn ya  
She gonna make you a fool  
But it'll learn ya  
Way, way better than school  
That I got a soul that's got a spark  
Oh, yeah, holdin' a real hot wire  
You got a hungry flame in the dark  
And lord, we gonna cook it with fire  
  
That I got a soul that's got a spark  
Oh, yeah, holdin' a real hot wire  
You got a hungry flame in the dark  
And lord, we gonna cook it with fire  
  
Cookin' with fire, fire, fire

Zingara why, do they speak your name?  
Whisper like a class  
Why do you walk in empty shoes  
Through long and lonely dusk?  
Why do you sleep with strangeness  
Dream of bitter rage?  
Sing your song in the mirror  
Like a bird outside a cage  
Yea, yea  
  
The land lies large unwinding  
Freezing from the miles  
But colder still are the home fires  
The ashes of the wild  
Down the road, down you fly  
Never a heart to stay  
A lost guitar in fields afar  
Ever hell to pay  
  
Strangers are eyes, oh oh  
  
Down, down, down, down Corduroy Road  
Down, down, down, down  
Down, down, down, down Corduroy Road  
Down, down, down, down  
  
Zingara why do they speak your name?  
Whisper like a cuss  
Why do you walk in empty shoes  
In long and lonely dusk?  
  
Strangers are eyes, oh oh  
  
Down, down, down, down Corduroy Road  
Down, down, down, down  
Down, down, down, down Corduroy Road  
Down, down, down, down  
  
Down, down, down, down Corduroy Road

If we still have time, we might still get by  
Every time I think about it, I want to cry  
With bombs and the devil, and the kids keep comin'  
No way to breathe easy, no time to be young  
  
But I tell myself that I was doin' all right  
There's nothin' left to do at night  
But go crazy on you  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
  
My love is the evenin' breeze touchin' your skin  
The gentle, sweet singin' of leaves in the wind  
The whisper that calls after you in the night  
And kisses your ear in the early moonlight  
And you don't need to wonder, you're doing fine  
My love, the pleasure's mine  
  
Let me go crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, ohhh  
  
Wild man's world is cryin' in pain  
What you gonna do when everybody's insane  
So afraid of one who's so afraid of you  
What you gonna do, ohh  
  
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)  
  
Oohh crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you  
  
I was a willow last night in my dream  
I bent down over a clear running stream  
Sang you the song that I heard up above  
And you kept me alive with your sweet flowing love  
  
Crazy  
Yeah, crazy on ya  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, oh  
Crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you, yeah  
  
(Ah-ah-ah-ah)  
  
Crazy on ya  
Crazy on you  
Let me go crazy, crazy on you

Every night without you is more than I can bear  
Moonlight can be torture when your love isn't there  
I see you in the shadows I can hear you in the wind  
I think of you and I can feel my world closin' in  
I can't sleep I keep wishin' I could touch you  
I'd be fine if I could make it through, through these  
Cruel nights, cruel nights  
Missing you, nights  
What do I do, nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Counting every minute, every minute feels like days  
Feels like time is standing still since you went away  
Always thought you'd stay forever, always thought that you'd be here  
Now it's been a lifetime since I held you near  
Days crawl by, I keep wishing they'd be over  
But I know they're only leading me to, to these  
Cruel nights, cruel nights  
Missing you, nights  
What, what do I do, nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Cruel nights, since we've been apart  
Cruel nights, it's been tearing up my heart  
Cruel nights, since you've been away, baby, cruel nights  
Oh, I just can't get through another night  
Without you beside me, I need you beside me  
I can't sleep I keep wishin' I could touch you  
I'd be fine if I could make it through  
Through these  
These cruel nights, cruel nights  
Missin' you, nights, baby  
What do I, what do I do nights  
Cruel nights without your love  
Cruel nights, it's tearing me apart  
Cruel nights, you're playing with me heart  
Cruel nights, since you've been away  
Cruel nights, well, well, well baby  
Cruel nights, these cruel nights  
These cruel, cruel nights  
Cruel nights come home come home baby  
Cruel nights, come home now baby  

Standing in line on the depot floor  
Taking my time getting through the door  
Daddy said "Go!" and mama just cried  
Sister said "Devil's on the other side"  
Hurricane blowing, water gets high  
Can't turn around or I'll drown in lies  
  
When I get back I'm gonna own this town  
Shine that medal and wear that crown  
Fall on my knees and kiss the ground  
Dear old America  
  
Run run rabbit save your rabbit skin  
Jump right back in your hole again  
Bullets they cry whispering drone  
Fire in the sky God's on the phone  
  
When I get home I'm gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
Nobody knows what this is all about  
Dear old America  
  
We don't beg and we don't run  
We don't lose, we don't overcome  
Purple mountain majesty sliding to a broken sea  
Daddy he swear and mama she cry  
"My sweet baby she's bound to die"  
  
When I get back I'm gonna feel just fine  
One more day I'm gonna do my time  
Ain't no hammer gonna ring like mine  
  
When I get home I'm gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
No one knows what this is all about now  
  
When I get home I'm gonna shove my doubts  
Dream my dreams and shut my mouth  
No one knows what this is all about  
  
Dear old America

You're gone from mean street  
Each time our eyes meet, I want to touch you  
Sudden attraction, such strange reaction  
Hold me to you, then you push me away  
I want to make you, make you  
Make you want to stay  
So let me take you, take you  
Take you baby all the way  
'Cause I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
Learned all that you want, babe  
Then why don't you show, babe, don't play with me baby  
'Cause I'll find somebody who knows how to love me  
So if you want it, you better take it right now  
I want to make you, make you  
Make you want to stay  
So let me take you, take you  
Take you baby all the way  
'Cause I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
Come on and take me through the night  
You know I won't put up a fight  
Just wrap your arms around me tight  
Tonight, tonight, tonight  
Wondered when you make me  
It might make you want to stay  
If you don't take me  
Life might never take me back this way  
I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
I feel that desire  
You're the flame that feeds my fire  
Will you take me higher?  
Give me that love that I desire  
Desire  
Desire  
Desire  

There I was with the old man  
Stranded again so off I'd ran  
A young world crashing around me  
No possibilities of getting what I need  
He looked at me and smiled  
Said "No, no, no, no, no child  
  
See the dog and butterfly  
Up in the air he likes to fly."  
Dog and butterfly  
Below she had to try  
She roll back down to the warm soft ground, laughing  
She don't know why, she don't know why  
Dog and butterfly  
  
Well I stumbled upon your secret place  
Safe in the trees you had tears on your face  
Wrestling with your desires frozen strangers  
Stealing your fires, the message hit my mind  
Only words that I could find  
  
See the dog and butterfly  
Up in the air he like to fly  
Dog and butterfly below she had to try  
She roll back down to the warm soft ground  
Laughing to the sky, up to the sky  
Dog and butterfly  
  
We're getting older the world's getting colder  
For the life of me I don't know the reason why  
Maybe it's livin' making us give in  
Hearts rolling in taken back on the tide  
We're balanced together ocean upon the sky  
  
Another night in this strange town  
Moonlight holding me light as down  
Voice of confusion inside of me  
No begging to go back where I'm free  
Feels like I'm through  
Then the old man's words are true  
  
See the dog and butterfly  
Up in the air he like to fly  
Dog and butterfly, below she had to try  
She roll back down to the warm soft ground  
With a little tear in her eye  
She had to try, she had to try  
Dog and butterfly

Please don't fight me baby  
This silence has got to stop  
You used to want to know my mind  
But now I even hate to bring that up  
You get so down  
Down on me  
  
All these nights I rocked you  
Didn't I lay it on you enough  
I always give you something wild  
And sweet  
But it's hard to keep it up  
When you get so down  
Down on me  
  
Gently I want to dance you darlin'  
Breathin', breathe it in slowly groovin'  
Wrapped around in sweet, sweet chains  
Feel the romance when we move  
  
You know I can't resist  
I got a need for you  
Please baby reach into your kindest mind  
Tell me what I am going to do  
If it all comes down  
Down on me

Heading out this morning into the sun  
Riding on the diamond waves, little darlin' one  
  
Warm wind caress her  
Her lover it seems  
Oh, Annie  
Dreamboat Annie my little ship of dreams  
  
Going down the city sidewalk alone in the crowd  
No one knows the lonely one whose head's in the clouds  
  
Sad faces painted over with those magazine smiles  
Heading out to somewhere won't be back for a while

The color blue  
I always felt it like a sigh  
But this is new  
This blue fire inside his eyes  
With feet of snow  
I try in vain  
He makes the northern lights come dance for me again  
  
(chorus)  
He's good enough  
He's sweet enough  
He's man enough a little touch  
I need so much  
I want so much  
I need to feel that secret touch  
Why can't I break out  
Why won't he reach out for me  
Oh Loneliness  
It comes and it goes  
But lately loneliness loneliness  
It just grows and grows and grows  
Cause here he is living deep inside  
Nowhere nowhere nowhere to hide  
  
(chorus)

"I'm the one who can please you"  
Ain't that what you said  
You seemed so alone  
I guess I was easily led  
  
I showed you my love  
But I guess that it went to your head  
When you were hungry  
I brought you your breakfast in bed  
  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
A good man pays his debt  
But you ain't paid yours yet  
Even it  
Even it up  
  
I took you down over the tracks when  
You wanted some sin  
I brought you satin and herbs from  
The places I been  
Now something tells me you're  
Going to use me again  
You think you can lay down the how and  
The where and the when  
  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
Even it up, even it up, even it up  
I don't want to bum it all  
But this ax she got to fall  
Even it  
Even it up

The doctor said "Come back again next week, I think that you need me."  
All she did was cry  
She wanted to die "Doctor when can you see me?"  
There's a guy out there!  
Seems like he's everywhere!  
It just ain't fair!  
  
Heartless Heartless! Never out of control  
Heartless Heartless! Sin in the name of rock and roll  
Heartless Heartless! He thinks it's so cool to be cold  
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul  
  
Late night in the penthouse room, the fire is burning  
Shadows are warm, laying in his arms she answers his yearning  
Her eyes are filled with sand  
  
Heartless Heartless! Never out of control  
Heartless Heartless! Sin in the name of rock and roll  
Heartless Heartless! He thinks it's so cool to be cold  
Never realize the way love dies when you crucify it's soul

I just found out  
It's been too long now  
The word is out  
Time before didn't they take us hook and punker?  
Their "jive alive" lines  
They were funk  
They were hijinx, hijinx, hijinx tonight  
We all know better but we just might  
  
Pullin' this off it's gonna take some  
Big time schemin'  
A fast tap dance, our feet'll be steamin'  
Hijinx, hijinx, hijinx, alright  
Hi, hi, hijinx, yeah, yeah  
  
You never know, behind the lines  
Who's gonna show  
Scandal high's been buzzin' through the mayhem  
Tonight the word, we heard is  
It might be them.  
They were hijinx, hijinx, hijinx tonight  
They all know better, but we just might  
  
Pullin' this off, it's gonna take some  
Big time schemin'  
A fast tap dance, our feet'll be steamin'  
  
Hijinx, hijinx, hijinx, alright  
Hi, hi, hijinx yeah, yeah  
Who's who?  
Who's who?  
Hi, hi, hijinx, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Who's who?  
Who's who?

Wake me up with laughter.  
Wrap me in your arms.  
This ain't  
No morning after.  
Never been so warm.  
It didn't take so long  
For us to feel this way.  
  
Can a good thing last longer than day? Where do we take it  
Now, now that we caught fire? Will something greater grow  
Out of this desire? Should I drop my guard at the risk of being  
Used but the way you do those things to me, how can I  
Refuse?  
  
I could get addicted to your energy the way you take me over,  
Pulling on me. Our hearts beat together, out timing is the same.  
  
Can I trust my feelings, save myself the pain? Where do we  
Take it now, now that we caught fire? Will something greater  
Grow out of this desire? Should I drop my guard at the risk of  
Being but the way you do those things to me, how can I  
Refuse?  
  
We could share the mystery, spare ourselves the misery.  
Discover it again everyday. We could take love all the  
Way.  
  
Where do we take it now, now that we caught fire? Will  
Something greater grow out of this desire? Should I drop my  
Guard at the risk of being used? But the way you do those  
Things to me, how can I refuse?

When the wind blows through your hair  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
I see your smile boy everywhere  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
  
I never thought this could happen to me  
If I've fallen over you  
Would it be so bad, would it be so bad  
Every night's an eternity  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
I never thought this could happen to me  
I want you so bad, bad  
  
When the wind blows through your hair  
I want you so bad, want you so bad  
Oh I wonder if you're aware  
I want you so bad  
I wonder if you care  
I never thought this would happen to me  
I want you so bad, bad  
  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad  
I want you so bad

Call it bad timing  
But I call it destiny  
It wouldn't have happened  
If it wasn't meant to be  
  
I felt your heart like a magnet  
Your eyes were touching me  
Touching me, touching me  
  
I want your world to turn  
Just for me  
I want your fire to burn just for me  
Like the moon affects the tide and the sea  
I want your world to turn just for me  
  
I won't share your love  
No, I want it all for my own  
When you are in her arms  
It really cuts me down to the bone  
  
I felt your heart like a magnet  
Your eyes were touching me  
Touching me, touching me  
  
I want your world to turn  
Just for me, yeah  
I want your fire to burn just for me  
Like the moon affects the tide and the sea  
I want your world to turn just for me

Caught you in the act, can't put up with that  
Messing where you shouldn't be  
I want to hear you say you're sorry  
Cause nobody takes advantage of me  
  
You're missing the mark, shooting in the dark  
I'm pulling the wool from my eyes  
Baby don't you push me further  
It's gonna hurt you if it happens twice  
  
If looks could kill  
You'd be lying on the floor  
You'd be begging me please please  
Baby don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
  
You're living on the edge, hanging by a thread  
I'm watching every move you make  
You don't want to see my anger  
So don't you make another mistake  
  
Love is on the line, I ain't about to be kind  
That's a promise and a threat  
If I was you I'd really cool it  
Or risk a night you'll never forget  
  
If looks could kill  
You'd be living on the floor  
You'd be begging me please please  
Darlin don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
  
I was a fool to believe in you  
A sucker for every line  
I'm a little less blind  
Than I was before  
I can see right through your design  
  
You'd be begging me please please  
Darlin' don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
  
You'd be begging me please please  
Darlin' don't hurt me no more  
If looks could kill  
You'd be reeling from the pain  
And you'd never lie again  
If looks could kill  
If looks could kill

These have been quiet days  
When was the last time I wanted to sing  
Last few dying days hanging on - what will they bring?  
Even you and me  
We keep coming apart  
And it's a wrong thing  
We goota look right at each other and say it  
Turn on the radio and play it  
And fall in love again  
Can you feel the light shine  
You now this song's yours and mine  
Ain't it good to know you've got a place to go  
Where the melody's fine  
Sometimes I'm not so strong  
And even now I could be wrong  
But if you love me like music  
I'll be your song  
  
Lately the day's been grey  
And time's been hard  
Man up in town putting everybody down  
Watch him play his card  
When you get free come on home to me  
I'm gonna lay it down  
We got love - we've got to feel it and show it  
Make each other really know it  
And fall in love again  
We've got to be friends

One day I'll stop breathing  
My heart will stop beating  
I won't see your face again  
This flesh and blood is weak  
Life isn't ours to keep  
Sometime it has to end nd nd "echo"  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you will learn to forgive and forget  
The mistakes that I've made  
I broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
One thing will always be true  
I'll never stop loving you  
  
Fallin from your grace  
You'll never be replaced  
Lord knows how hard I've tried  
But it just aint no use  
I thought I could shake you loose  
I'm still torn up inside  
In time even memories fade away  
With time you will learn to forgive and forget  
The mistakes that I've made  
I've broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
But one thing will always be true  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
I broke some promises  
Sometimes I lied to you  
But one thing will always be true  
I'll never stop loving you.  
  
No I will never stop lovin you

Ain't got no trouble in my life  
No foolish dream to make me cry  
I'm never frightened or worried  
You know I always get by  
I heat up  
I cool down  
Something gets in my way I go around it  
Don't let life get me down  
Gonna take it the way that I found it  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
  
You say that life is a circle  
But that ain't the way that I found it  
Oh... gonna move in a straight line  
Keeping my feet firmly on the ground  
I heat up  
I cool down  
I got words in my head so I sing them  
Don't let life get me down  
I can't hold onto the blues, so I play them  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me  
I've got the music in me

Who was with you - where you been?  
Baby it can't be this again  
I can't cool it 'cos I can't win it with you  
  
Words like punches - things we said  
Under the belt and in the head  
Down for the count in a cold cold bed  
Beat by jealousy  
  
Jealousy - jealousy  
Stanglehold - love can't breathe  
Let me be - set me free  
Jealousy  
  
You won't hear what I imply  
What you say - I won't buy  
You deny but you lie  
Jealousy  
  
Jealousy - jealousy  
Stanglehold - love can't breathe  
Let me be - set me free  
Jealousy  
  
Down suspicious - torn in doubt  
Dirty vicious - knock me out  
Danger, danger - stakes are high  
Hook the blow between the eyes  
Every round - we lose more ground  
Jealousy  
  
Jealousy - jealousy  
Stanglehold - love can't breathe  
Let me be - set me free  
Jealousy

Out of the street, get on home  
Tail shaking filly running on her own  
They say she got loose on the night  
She was born  
Cranking it up in a school zone  
  
"Kick it out, kick it out", she said  
"kick out your motor and drive  
While you're still alive, kick it out!"  
  
Sitting in a bar in a seaside town  
Sweet little love getting high getting down  
Sailors see her running along the beach  
Laugh and jump out of reach  
  
Wild music blowing in her mane  
She needs a bareback rider won't give her  
No pain  
A hard racy game of give and take  
Leaves them dazed, half crazed, in her wake  
  
"Kick it out, kick it out", she said  
"kick out your motor and drive  
While you're still alive, kick it out!"

I been trying a long, long time  
To write a love letter, perfect lines  
What I want to say is hard to find  
No cliches or tired rhymes  
But words turn on me hard as I try  
Your look of love, I can't describe  
I'll use the language of love  
The language of love  
You'll understand what I say  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way  
Bad, bad heartaches when I'm alone  
Fighting with feelings I've never known  
Scared and lonely, half gone mad  
'Coz I need what I just can't have  
I write a love letter like a kiss in the night  
Wanna tell it to you just right  
I'll use the language of love  
The language of love  
You'll understand what I say  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way  
I need love so very bad  
You are the best I've ever had  
I need to say, I need to show  
In the way only lovers know  
I'll use the language of love  
The language of love  
You'll understand what I say  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way  
Use the language of love  
Language of love  
Words are never enough  
The language of love is the only way  

Look at me, the answer is so clear  
Lying close by the fire place  
I wish that you could see yourself this way  
My love, with the firelight upon your face.  
  
Ain't it strange how love put things together?  
One like you, someone like me.  
But no one ever moved me like the way you do  
And held against you, love I am weak, oh yeah  
  
Before us now, the dream of love is playin'  
A butterfly risin' from the flame  
You and me don't need no chain  
Since this feeling came to us  
A touch of love, a lighter touch  
  
This touch of love, this lighter touch,  
Than hands of love through time  
Reaching up to have and to hold you  
But you know I'll always stay If I  
Am free to go. You know I'll take  
Your love into my soul. Be lighter  
Touch of love this lighter, lighter  
Lighter touch

You'd rather have wine than gin  
Only the finest by your skin  
Always running after Time, catching  
You're fancy with rhyme  
Shining on the front page again  
  
Hot on the presses today, little queen  
Making your passion play, little queen  
Nobody knows your melancholy mind,  
Little queen  
  
Away from the sellers, the papers said  
Your crown was tight and heavy on your head  
Still you danced and you sang, all night  
The telephone rang  
Music kept on playing from your pen.  
  
Hot on the presses today, little queen  
Making your passion play, little queen  
Nobody knows your melancholy mind,  
Little queen  
  
Raining Raining- he knows your Soul ain't free  
Raining Raining- he feels you little queen  
  
Slipping away with your gypsy band  
Hot on your music and playing a winning hand  
He was standing in the line, thinking how you  
Moved his mind  
Feeling like he held you in his hand

As it was before shall it ever ever be  
Hear it on the crying wind  
Heart it weeping on the sea  
Through the winder valley wild and through the darkest night  
Here comes the evil news of the coming fight  
So love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tides release  
Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tides release  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on down lost angel find us now  
From the clouds above right down to the ground  
Come on down lost angel find us now  
From the clouds above right down to the ground  
Lost Angels come on down  
  
Stardust yeah we are and the river is pushed to bend  
Too much too much of man  
And stardust we will someday be again  
Oh love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tide release  
Love bring your birds bring your feathers of peace  
All through the storm let the tide release  
  
[Chorus]

The sky was dark this morning  
When I raised my head  
I stood at the window  
Darkness was my bane  
  
Suddenly a sunbeam arch  
Thrilled me to my weary heart  
It was the prettiest thing I'd ever seen  
  
I knew I had to keep my love  
Keep my love alive  
Keep my love keep my love live  
  
Baby I want you to roll me  
Hold me in your love  
No more habits, promises and jive  
Ever since I was a baby girl  
Wanted one thing most in this world  
It was to keep my love  
Keep my love alive  
  
I want to keep my love  
Keep my love alive  
Keep my love keep my love alive  
  
You're up there under the spotlight  
Your silver trophy shines  
With all you got, my lord!  
You must get high  
You need a whole lot more than money  
You need more than to survive  
You need to keep your love  
Keep your love alive

K.C.  
Take another sip-o-wine  
You gotta get her off your mind  
You can talk about your heartbreak to me  
Ok, K.C. I wish it could be easy  
Just another lesson of the heart  
K.C.  
We were feelin' out of place  
So we made our own escape  
In that New York cafe place to be  
Outsider, traveler you and me  
We were laughing about it  
Kept us out of reach  
I won't forget that night  
I won't forget that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with all your pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake  
You said we'll still be sitting  
Here again someday,  
Laughing at ourselves this way  
After time has healed and made it right  
We'll still be looking in each other's eyes  
And through it all  
It's friends who will survive  
I won't forget that night  
I won't forget that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake  
I won't forget that night  
I won't forge that light  
Through the window and the lace  
Making patterns on your face  
Exposed with all your pain  
I know it hurts the worst  
That very first love mistake

Cold, late night so long ago  
When I was not so strong you know  
A pretty man came to me  
I never seen eyes so blue  
You know, I could not run away it seemed  
We'd seen each other in a dream  
Seemed like he knew me, he looked right through me, yeah  
  
"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile  
"you don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Try, try, try to understand, I'm a magic man"  
  
Winter nights we sang in tune  
Played inside the months of moon  
"Never think of never..let this spell last forever"  
Well, summer lover passed to fall  
Tried to realize it all  
Mama says she's worried, growing up in a hurry  
  
"Come on home, girl" Mama cried on the phone  
"Too soon to lose my baby yet, my girl should be at home"  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Try, try, try to understand, he's a magic man, Mama, ah  
He's a magic man  
  
"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile  
"I cast my spell of love on you, a woman from a child"  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Oh, oh, try, try, try to understand,  
He's a magic man, oh, he's got the magic hands  
  
Oh's over top  
  
"Come on home, girl" he said with a smile  
"You don't have to love me yet, let's get high awhile"  
But try to understand, try to understand  
Try, try, try to understand, he's a magic man, yeah, oh

She grew up in an Indiana town,  
Had a good-lookin' mama who never was around.  
But she grew up tall and she grew up right  
With them Indiana boys on them Indiana nights.  
  
Well, she moved down here at the age of eighteen.  
She blew the boys away, was more than they'd seen.  
I was introduced and we both started groovin'.  
I said, "I dig you baby, but I got to keep movin' on.  
Keep movin' on."  
  
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.  
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.  
  
Well, I don't know, but I've been told,  
You never slow down, you never grow old.  
I'm tired of screwin' up, tired of going down,  
Tired of myself, tired of this town.  
  
Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.  
Honey, put on that party dress.  
Buy me a drink, sing me a song.  
Take me as I come 'cause I can't stay long.  
  
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.  
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.  
  
There's pigeons down on Market Square.  
She's standin' in her underwear,  
Lookin' down from a hotel room.  
Nightfall will be comin' soon.  
  
Oh, my, my. Oh, hell, yes.  
You got to put on that party dress.  
It was too cold to cry when I woke up alone.  
I hit my last number and walked to the road.  
  
Last dance with Mary Jane, one more time to kill the pain.  
I feel summer creepin' in and I'm tired of this town again.

If the 59 is gone  
That's the train that I am on  
You can hear the whistle blow a million miles  
  
I would give up all my life  
Trying to get it right  
I'm five million miles from my home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home  
  
If the 59 is gone  
That's the train that I am on  
You can hear the whistle blow a million miles  
  
I would give up all my life  
Trying to get it right  
I'm one million miles from home  
  
I got one  
I got two  
I got three  
I got four  
I got five million miles 'til I get home  
  
I got one

No wind when I took the watch  
My ship was still and waitin'  
I lay on that mirrored sky  
A restless sail or waitin'  
I closed my eyes said the  
Words of will for the gentle  
Breathin' that moves the seas  
Make my sails fill  
  
Whisper waves cloud the glass  
Awake at last like a lover  
It rushed around the talkin' sweet  
Roll over, roll over, roll over  
And in my ear he blew his name  
It sound so strange but I heard it plain  
Mistral Mistral wind  
  
I have always held the wheel but  
I let the wind steal my power  
Spin me 'round lose my course  
Nights run be like hours  
Well, it would show me the way  
To the deepest mountains  
Too high and beautiful to be  
Mistral, mistral wind  
  
All the hours on the watch  
I wait for that breeze to move me  
And blow me back to that place  
Magic space all through me  
And I sigh your name  
Across the empty water  
You made a crazy dreamer out of me  
Mistral, mistral, mistral, mistral,  
Mistral, mistral

Heading out this morning into the sun  
Riding on the diamond waves, little darlin' one  
Warm wind caress her  
Her lover it seems  
Oh, Annie  
Dreamboat Annie my little ship of dreams  
Going down the city sidewalk alone in the crowd  
No one knows the lonely one whose head's in the clouds  
Sad faces painted over with those magazine smiles  
Heading out to somewhere won't be back for a while

Talk talk talk people are hammering in my brain  
Say so much nothing it's making me insane  
Telling out those rumors its gonna get hard to take  
Goes on and on what you gotta tolerate  
But never you mind, hey, don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus]  
Move on, let it ride  
Move on, leave it all behind  
Shine it on, shine your light  
Don't look back just leave it all behind I'll see you some other time  
Move on  
  
Them friends of many are really known by none  
Forever high school jealousy 101  
Make so much misery in this clich town  
They just love to get it up for the big let down  
But never you mind, hey don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
See you on the flip side

I keep my secrets locked up tight  
I keep my emotions out of sight  
But you got me memorized  
What's in my heart, what's behind my eyes  
You hold me tight, you hold me fast  
Won't let go until the storm has passed  
When I finally break down I'm so in love  
I ain't afraid to ask, I am not afraid, no  
Baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
You're there inside me, in my dreams  
Sexy poems, cinematic scenes  
Shattered lullabies unfold  
Sweet suggestions I have never known  
Pull down the shade, turn off the light  
Oh, my love were all alone tonight  
Shadow dancing in slow-mo  
For your eyes I will let it show  
You can feel me glow  
Oh, baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Maybe it's heaven or your sweet suggestion  
Holding me in your sway  
Carried away in the arms of an angel  
You are my saving grace  
Baby, love me out, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets, oh  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head  
Oh, baby, love me out now, love me out of this world  
No alibis, no more regrets, no more regrets  
You're my wayward angel  
You're my saving grace  
Sanctify my crazy head, oh, ooh  

Fire eye flashin' bright  
Come again into my dream tonight  
Don't fade away when the mornin' comes  
Fadin' in the sun  
Nada One, Nada One  
  
Moon shone silver in your eye  
Shown on my midnight blues from the sky  
Paint the night with love till the burnin' sun  
See the colors run  
Nada One, Nada One  
  
Mornin' come down on me  
Wanderin' through the endless street  
Nobody seein' where I've been  
Nobody feels what I've done  
Nada One, Nada One  
  
Look inside I find  
Your song flows around my mind  
You are as real as I feel  
You are the moon in my sun  
Nada One, Nada One

Wake up love, wake up babe  
I wanna tell you, let me say  
Dreaming never looked so true  
One word ain't enough  
Heaven's finding eyes in you  
How can I say love?  
Many smilers lie to each other, oh  
Children hide with pretty words, oh  
So many times we seem to find  
Children play too rough  
Never too late for what we are made for  
How can I say love?  
All this feeling here inside  
One word ain't enough  
The way to say it seems to hide  
How can I say love?  
How do we wind up?  
Why do we wind up so alone?  
How many roads do we gotta travel on  
Till we find out we're already home?  
Already home  
All this feeling here inside  
One word ain't enough  
The way to say it seems to hide  
How can I say love?  

I saw you standing on the street below  
Outside my window surrounded by a glow  
You were a young man troubled hadn't found its way  
You were smiling, that's all you had to say  
I thought I saw you  
Pennsylvania  
  
The streets were busy, the cafes and the bars  
People laughing, the flash of cars  
The neon tower like a fist up in the sky  
All that power like a spit in heaven's eye  
I thought I saw you  
Pennsylvania  
I thought I saw you  
Pennsylvania  
  
A bell is ringing in the courthouse square  
Rusted angels floating everywhere  
St. Michael singing to the spirits passing by  
To blacked out windows and the silence there inside  
I thought I heard you  
Pennsylvania  
I thought I saw you  
  
The alley in the rain  
The hotel by a train  
The well known ghosts remain  
  
Thought I felt you  
You in Pennsylvania

Doesn't it look good for flying  
Can't wait for high noon to fall into night  
Put out my arms the air just takes me  
Rising moon calls me into the sky  
  
Up, up I go  
Searching on my radio  
  
Pilot through time  
Spirit flying  
Move with mine  
Out of time  
  
Pilot I fell through  
From the blue  
I just flew  
Into you  
  
If the air is high and I hear the moon  
I'll find you alright  
Wherever you're hiding in the night  
I know it won't be long  
Your signal's getting strong  
  
Pilot through time  
Spirit flying  
Move with mine  
Out of time  
  
Pilot I fell through  
From the blue  
I just flew  
Into you

How are you?  
You can start anytime  
Got an appointment to keep for seven nights I couldn't sleep  
I'm in a state of disbelief it's my big chance on magic street  
I followed this fashion doll down the famous hall  
"Ginger won't be long at all", she said, "Take a number, you'll be called"  
I said, "I'm gonna show him what I can do  
Now it's just between us two"  
In the grand tradition, private audition  
I said, "I'm gonna show him what I can do  
And now it's just between us two"  
In the grand tradition, private audition, yeah  
Wish I knew then, what I know now  
I don't know what I did wrong I thought I really laid it on  
But when he called out for some more, I gave him my standard encore  
I gave him the Swanee River the good ship Rockin' Rye  
The Stars and Stripes Forever and the good old pal of mine  
But that ain't what he was on about, he was casting for his couch  
He said, "Come baby, show me what you can do  
And now it's just between us two"  
In the grand tradition, private audition  
You said, "Baby, baby, show me what you can do  
And now it's just between us two"  
It's a grand tradition, private audition, yeah  

You are the only ones  
You save me from myself  
My company shows on me  
I've been raised on you  
  
And when it just ain't fair  
Nothing's left to do  
But sit down here  
And have a beer  
Whatever the world wants to choose  
  
Don't let it fade  
Don't trade love away  
Just keep a sweet dream true  
Let's go tell the world  
To quit turning cold  
Just let me be raised on you  
  
We don't have to change just now  
We can laugh about the load  
I can see us later  
Lighted eyes  
Likely be laughing  
Down the road

Ring them bells yea heathen  
From the city that dreams  
Ring them bells from the sanctuaries  
Cross the valleys and streams  
For they're deep and they're wide  
And the world's on it's side  
And time is running backwards and so is the bride  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells!  
  
Ring them bells Saint Peter  
Where the four winds blow  
Ring them bells with an iron hand so the people will know  
That the rush hour is now on the wheel  
And the plow and the sun is going down  
Upon the sacred cow  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
  
Ring them bells Saint Martha for the poor man's son  
Ring them bells so the world will know that God is one  
For the shepherd is asleep where the willows weep  
And the mountains are filled with little lost sheep  
Ring them bells for the blind and the deaf  
Ring them bells for all of us who are left  
Ring them bells for the chosen few  
Who would judge the many when the game is through  
Ring them bells for the time that flies,  
For the child that cries when  
Innocence dies  
Ring them bells Saint Catherine  
From the top of the room  
Ring them bells from the fortress  
From the lilies that bloom  
For the lines they are long  
And the fighting is strong  
And they're breaking down the distance  
Between right and wrong  
  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells  
Ring them bells!

Oh, honey, honey, honey,

Don't want to stay here  
Honey roll  
Sooner or later  
You've gotta get down and sing  
Sing child

Say so long baby  
Turn around  
Loneliness hits you  
Emptiness closes you down  
Alone in his car  
  
You think of his name  
Took part of you with him  
It won't be the same  
You love to relive  
The love that he gives  
  
You love to recall  
The rush of it all  
He woos you so sweet  
Then kicks on the heat  
You're willing, you're hot  
Give him all that you got  
Lonely woman gets so cold  
With no loverboy to hold  
  
One more night she's on her own  
Nobody meant to sleep alone  
You're waiting too hard, counting the days  
Till he comes home to lift you out of this haze  
You dream all day, climb the walls all night  
No satisfaction till he makes it right  
  
So hard to kick  
The memory addicting you  
So hard to lick  
The romance afflicting you  
  
You love to relive the love that he gives  
You love to recall the rush of it all  
Lonely woman gets so cold  
With no lover boy to hold  
One more night she's on her own  
Nobody meant to sleep alone

Today you looked around to my heart's call  
This tiny life ain't been strangled after all  
Time, time, time, time  
Never ask what's become of us  
Just dedicate your sorrow  
Here and now  
To the soul of the sea  
And me  
  
Rushin' to me  
You turned around to my song's call  
You dreamer in the sand  
Just lie there laughing til the fall  
Kindest lover  
I can't stay alone tonight  
Bring me all your love  
Here and now  
Come rushin' to me  
  
Wake up late  
Without a smile  
Telephone rings  
You run like a child  
On the street  
Into the day  
The people I meet  
Have nothing to say  
  
No smile  
No sorrow  
No laughter  
No tomorrow  
They talk hen to hen  
They talk about their men  
And practice all the tricks for them  
Too soon nightime's coming on  
Deep in the darkness feeling alone  
  
No rain  
No seed  
No dreams  
No silence  
Far away today  
Mama ocean hold me to you  
Rock me on your waves  
And tell me...  
Is it all true?  
  
Time, time, time, time  
Never ask what's become of us  
Dedicate your sorrow  
Here and now  
To the soul the sea and me

Quite some time, I been sittin' it out  
Didn't take no chances, I was a prisoner of doubt  
I knocked down the wailin' wall, it ain't no sin  
I, got, the feel of fortune, deal me in  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm comin' straight on for you  
You made my mind  
Now I'm stronger, now I'm comin' through,  
Straight on, straight on for you,  
Straight on for you  
  
Now, I know, I got to play my hand  
What the winner don't know, the gambler understands  
My heart keeps playin' it through with you, my friend  
I'll take my chances on you, again and again, again  
  
[Chorus]

Standing here helpless  
Where do I go  
If you leave me alone  
Where do I turn now  
If it don't work out  
As far as I can see  
This isn't the way  
You said it would be  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
  
Don't leave me now  
Don't leave me  
  
Wasn't it you who brought me here  
To the place that lovers go  
Just look at these arms  
Reaching out to you  
Said that you always care  
I just turned around  
And there's nobody there  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
  
Don't leave me now  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
Stranded  
  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
If you walk away now  
You leave me empty handed  
Don't leave me like this  
Don't leave me stranded  
Stranded

Get out that wig - I know you  
Put on those shiny pointed shoes  
We'll have a strange night  
Corsage - long gown - all the rest  
That ain't what we call dressed  
For a strange night  
  
You're gonna lose who you are  
We could take it pretty far  
Can there ever be any harm  
  
No one will know you  
You won't show  
Feels wild like we used to  
Just tonight that the feeling's right  
We'll wear a disguise that won't  
Show through  
  
We'll go out in the old red car  
You can sit in the bakc seat and play  
Your guitar  
If the blue lights flash while we're rockin  
Don't you worry I'll do the talking  
And tell it right  
  
You're gonna lose who you are  
We could take it pretty far  
Can there ever be any harm  
  
No one will know you  
You won't show  
Feels wild like we used to  
Just tonight that the feeling's right  
We'll wear a disguise that won't  
Show through  
  
Let's just stop at random places  
Just to see the look on their faces  
What a strange sight  
Put on that wig, I know you  
I know what you like to do  
Have a strange night

Through the mist on the harbor  
Dancing lights on the water  
Shadows move I see you smiling again  
When I reach out to touch you  
Like a ghost looking through me  
Sending chills deep into me  
Shattered dreams falling like  
Teardrops again  
As you make me remember  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Don't take chances they'll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I don't want to be  
Strangers at heart  
  
Broken glass of my mirror  
Makes my eyes see much clearer  
You and I only a whisper away  
Never telling each other  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Don't take chances they'll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I don't want to be  
Strangers at heart  
  
Strangers of the heart  
Always safe with words unspoken  
Strangers of the heart  
Don't take chances they'll get broken  
No matter where you are  
Hear me tonight I don't want to be  
Strangers at heart

We walked away before, there were too many storms  
We could not get through, but I still kept loving you  
Now fate brought you back to me, this time I won't let you leave  
I'm holding on to you, forever, I'm never letting go  
The time I spent away from you, was time that made me see  
I need to live my life with you, I need you here with me  
And it would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind to pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time, it would take a strong, strong wind  
Hearts sometimes lose their way, but they find their way back someday  
To the arms they need and I need you like the air I breathe  
The time I spent away from you was time lost in the rain  
I'm meant to live my life with you, that's something nothing can change  
It would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind to tear away this heart of mine  
Make us break apart this time, yeah, it would take a strong, strong wind  
This time I'm holding on with everything  
This time I won't let go for anything  
And it would take a strong, strong wind to take me from your arms again  
To take me from your side  
It would take a strong, strong wind to pull away this heart of mine  
To make us break apart this time, it would take a strong, strong wind  
Yeah baby, it would take a strong, strong wind  

Sweet darlin'  
You saved me  
I'm hummin'  
From the lovin'  
You gave me  
You went so far  
Where my feelings are  
Breathing heaven fire  
Sweet darlin'  
  
I know you  
You stopped running  
You knew I had something  
To show you  
The fever tamed  
Like an angel came  
Made music of my name  
Sweet darlin'  
  
Early that morning we knew I had to fly  
Engines were screaming and still I was asking myself why  
High on the wind I was feeling my sweet darlin' cry  
My heart was breaking  
I closed my eyes  
Darlin'  
Can you hear me  
We can't be wrong  
The night's song  
Pulls you near me  
Time just falls  
Distance small  
I feel you all  
Sweet darlin'

I'm so tired of these men trying to  
Impress me with nothing  
The same old routine and the smooth  
Fancy talking  
Now I know and believe that I found  
It for real  
'Cause you're good and you're kind and  
You care how I feel  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes  
You're so beautiful  
  
I've been pushed I've been pulled  
I've been put out and trod on  
Just by taking my chances I finally  
Caught on  
When I see in your eyes all the love  
Shining through  
I'm so glad I held out for somebody  
Like you  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes  
  
Heaven must have sent you I know  
You're so good to me  
I feel good with you  
I'd be such a fool to let you go  
There's something about you  
I can't live without you  
  
I've had fast talking good looking men  
At my door  
Now I'm a wiser woman than I was before  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes  
  
I had a tall dark handsome stranger  
I've had the devil in disguise  
I've been attracted to the danger  
But I was never satisfied  
And I know what I like  
And I like what I see in your eyes

Now everybody in this neighborhood  
All you women better listen good  
I know it's just a matter of time  
Till one of you steps out of line  
All I got is this to say  
Simple message to relay  
Get out of here and just keep away  
'cause this man is mine  
This man is mine  
This man, this man is mine  
  
I know the women round here  
Recognize something good  
Even try to take it if they could  
So I'm using every little trick I know  
Making sure that he won't go  
I put up all my resistance  
All you girls you better keep your distance  
We don't need no more of your assistance  
  
This man is mine  
This man is mine  
This man, this man is mine  
  
He got passion burning in his eyes  
Steaming up the night  
Always makes me realize  
What I done was right  
  
This man is mine  
This man is mine  
This man, this man is mine  
(Gonna love him  
Gonna teach him  
Gonna tell him  
Gonna reach him)

Deep inside this city night, only you and me  
I can only hear your voice and all you see  
Baby I love you, born to be mine  
I'll say forever, you say all the time  
Take it like a vow  
We're together now  
Together now, together now  
Together now, together now  
In this world so fast, nothing lasts  
But I can feel it  
We're gonna to make it together  
Now you're winning in big town trade  
Lose it once, try to get saved  
Talk gets cheap, money gets made  
In too deep, time steals away  
I call you up, get you on the line  
Wanna get back, where we were that time  
Wanna get you out, out of this place  
Hold you close, just to see your face  
Together now, together now  
Together now, together now  
Together now, together now  
Together now, together now  

Well I have lost some time but I have won  
And if you make it through  
You know you've just begun  
  
The winter cold is coming  
And the fire will soon be burning  
  
So will you treat me well  
Oh, will you treat me well?  
  
And I am asking will you save a place for me  
To rest beside your heart  
And feel I'm free  
Now what good does feeling strong do  
When I am here without you?  
  
So will you treat me well  
Oh well, will you treat me well?

Oh, my love, my darling  
I've hungered for your touch  
Alone, lonely time  
And time goes by so slowly  
And time can do so much  
Are you still mine  
I need your love  
I need your love  
God, speed your love to me  
Lonely rivers flow to the sea to the sea  
To the open arms of the sea  
Lonely river sigh, wait for me, wait for me  
I'll be coming home  
Wait for me  
Oh, my love, my darling  
I've hungered, hungered for your touch  
Oh, my, lonely time  
And time goes by so slowly and time can do so much  
Are you still mine, I need your love I need your  
Love, God speed your love to me.

Now the summers come and gone.  
I Feel September comin' on.  
Your still burning on my skin.  
Lord I want though, sweet rain drops to begin.  
Cool this fever and keep home, Up on Chery Blossom Road.  
  
Now your as mean as I am good.  
And I'd stop comin' here if I could.  
You laugh at all my school girl fears...  
And you tell me 'when you want me little girl I'll be here'.  
I'd trade my body for my soul.  
Up on Cherry Blossom Road. Ooooh, yea.  
  
So blow cruel wind.  
Take me back to his door, he'll take me in.  
I walk away a woman.(walk away)  
I walk away a woman.(walk away)  
Walk away(walk away)  
  
In my virgin bed alone.  
Like a hostage to the phone,  
I know that he ain't far away.  
And I know that Lord he don't feel this kind of pain.  
I hate him, lord I want him so.  
Up on Cherry Blossom Road. Oh Ya!  
  
So Blow cruel wind. Take me back to his door.  
He'll take me in, I walk away a women(walk away).  
Walk away, walk away, walk away....

You haunt my room in the dead of night  
I see your face in the firelight  
Your hungry kiss I can't forget  
But I won't give it to you yet  
You got moves make a good girl sweat  
You won't catch me in your net  
You work your magic on my blues  
But I ain't no slave for you to use  
I won't beg and I won't crawl  
I won't be your voodoo doll  
Baby I won't be your voodoo doll  
Stirring up a potion of colors  
Making me crazy  
You got something I can't leave alone  
Shaking me  
Tremble...you're calling me baby  
Heaven help me turn my heart to stone  
Hey moon man - don't shine on me  
You are dnagerous company  
I got treasure in my chest  
And the price is high for all the rest  
Ain't no snake inside my wall  
I won't be your voodoo doll  
Baby I won't be your voodoo doll  

Someone told me to call  
So I did and no one answered  
And I don't hear a sound  
But I know someone's laughing  
I'm trying hard to keep my confidence  
You take advantage of my innocence  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
No one know you  
What you go though, but I do  
The phone keeps ringing  
No one know what you're thinking  
But I do, I do, I do  
They were laughing at you  
And I held out my hand  
I was trying to get through  
Without losing again  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
What's that you say I can't hear you  
Are those words meant for me,  
As they appear to be  
The tension in my voice awakes you  
You know who I am but my name escapes you  
They were looking for you  
And you started to run  
If they asked about you  
I wouldn't tell anyone  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer -  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
The kind of woman I am  
I do things that you can't understand  
But there are times when you should  
Check the line on my face  
Don't look at me now  
Look at me now  
Look at me now  
Where are you, how are you  
I wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
It's been so long. I'll hold on  
And wait for an answer  
Wait for an answer  
I'll wait, you make me wait  
Someone told me to call  

I've been lonely  
I've been waiting for you  
I'm pretending and that's all I can do  
The love I'm sending  
Ain't making it through to your heart  
  
You've been hiding - never letting it show  
Always trying to keep it under control  
You got it down and you're well  
On your way to the top  
But there's something that you forgot  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you  
You might need it some day  
  
I can't tell you what you're feeling inside  
And I can't sell you what you don't want to buy  
Something's missing and you got to  
Look back on your life  
You know something here just ain't right  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you  
  
What about love  
Don't you want someone to care about you  
What about love  
Don't let it slip away  
What about love  
I only want to share it with you

Night inside the city  
Empty sidewalks  
Stretching under dizzy lights  
Rain is hummin'  
The streets are runnin'  
Underneath the neon lights  
We run together  
We'll run forever  
Outta here ridin' the wheels  
  
Look at pretty windows  
At shiny people  
Statues under sparkling lights  
Just take a picture  
And a melted moment  
Flashin' on the crazy ride  
Just close your eyes now  
And breathe a sigh now  
We're gettin' outta here  
Outta here  
Ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ooh  
Ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin' the wheels  
  
(Wheels)  
  
Outta here, ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin' the wheels  
Ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin', ridin' the wheels  
(Ridin' the wheels)  
Ridin', ridin', ridin' the wheels  
Ridin' the wheels  
Ooh  
Oh  
Aye

This night's gone, we're moving on  
Highway's calling aloud  
I bring them in with eyes of sin  
It's a down drinkin' freaky crowd  
Chew you up and spit you out  
Never want to know your name  
Don't want to know you but I sure want to show you  
Never will forget I came  
On the world's all mine  
White lightning and wine came on so fast  
When did I last feel this fine?  
White lightning and wine  
Sweet little one let me love you some  
Take me or leave me alone  
The gooder they come, the harder they fall  
Turn around you are a nasty joke  
Yeah, we all laugh oh, hah, what a gas!  
Watching you chew on the bones  
In the morning light you didn't look so nice  
Guess you'd better hitch hike home

It's too late to turn back  
When the green lights flash  
Too late to turn around  
When the love goes down  
  
Your fire my fate  
This woman won't wait  
So love beam your laser light  
Get ready gonna take this flight  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
Two hearts one mind  
Baby you're my kind  
You're too hot you're too much  
You've got that personal touch  
  
Push button play thing  
Make my back door ring  
Fight fire with a little fire baby  
You oughta know you make this  
Little girl sing  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
Do your little shake baby  
Rattle and roll  
Ring my bell baby do my soul  
Don't let the grass grow under my feet  
Bang my drum baby feel my beat  
You're so wild  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me  
  
You're so wild  
(you're wild and willing)  
So wild (your spirit's free)  
You're such a wild wild child  
Oh baby go wild with me

I'm lying beside you just thinking about us  
Too tired to go to sleep and too much in love  
I know I'm crazy but I can't close my eyes  
I'm scared you won't be there in the morning when I rise  
Will you be there?  
Who do you dream about are you alone in your sleep?  
To who will you reach out?  
Oh, let it be me  
Oh baby, you're my obsession, my addiction, my drug  
Don't want to be without you when I wake up  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up, oh I need you to be there in the morning  
Will you be there?  
  
Well, you're so close to me but I feel so alone  
The more I touch you the more I want  
Don't know what to do about me loving you but I pray to god that you feel it
too  
You're my obsession, my addiction, my drug, so let the candle grow into a
great fire of love  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up?  
I need you to be there in the morning!  
I wanna love you forever,  
Don't want a love that's now or never  
Can't you see you got me down on the floor.  
I want more more!  
  
Will you be there in the morning, will you be there when I want you?  
Will you be there when I wake up?  
Will you be there in the morning?  
Will you be there?

Well I can't forget this evening  
Though your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes the sorrow show  
Yes it shows  
And I can't forget tomorrow  
When I think of all your sorrow  
When I had you there  
and then let you go  
And now it's only fair that I should let you know  
Yeah -- gotta know  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore  
Well I can't forget this evening  
though your face as you were leaving  
But I guess that's just the way the story goes  
You always smile but in your eyes your sorrow shows  
yes it shows  
I can't live if living is without you  
I can't give I can't give anymore no no more  
(repeat chorus)

What in the world did I do to deserve you  
I don't understand why you treat me that way  
You knew you were everything that I ever wanted  
You had your own ways of makin' me pay  
  
Then you took it just a little to far  
Now I see you for what you are  
I don't need the heartache anymore  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough - no  
  
You turned me into an emotional prisoner  
You hit me with words that cut to the bone - oh  
Then you kissed me and made me believe that I needed you  
And think I could never survive on my own - oh no  
  
Never thought that I would break away  
Now I see right through your power play  
And I don't feel so helpless after all  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
Hey, you aint' so tough  
  
You took me too far to forgive it  
That was your last mistake  
That was your last mistake  
  
Lovin' you was an endless fight  
I was wrong and you were always right  
But look what happened when I called your bluff  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough  
You take it all but you don't give back  
You feel strong when the odds are stacked  
There comes a time when enough's enough  
When the truth comes out  
You aint' so tough  
You aint' so tough  

We have the chance to turn the pages over  
We can write what we want to write  
We gotta make ends meet, before we get much older  
We're all someone's daughter We're all someone's son  
How long can we look at each other Down the barrel of a gun?  
You're the voice, try and understand it  
Make a noise and make it clear  
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo  
We're not gonna sit in silence  
We're not gonna live with fear  
Oh-wo-wo-wo, oh-wo-wo-wo  
This time, we know we all can stand together  
With the power to be powerful  
Believing we can make it better  
We're all someone's daughter  
We're all someone's son  
How long can we look at each other  
Down the barrel of a gun?
