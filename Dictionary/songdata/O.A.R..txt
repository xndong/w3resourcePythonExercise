Pick it up, don't put it down  
Do you recognize the feeling that I'm passing around  
Like your all lit up, feet on the floor  
Everywhere you go feel like you've been there before  
  
It's almost easy  
To believe this is how it could be  
Just to easy  
To see it could happen to me  
  
What a feeling when it takes control of you  
Everything you need is back ten fold  
Like a feeling do it comes and goes  
Then it's gone  
  
Oh no  
  
Then the rain came knocked me sideways  
Hope the wind will break my fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
When the rain just knocked me sideways  
I don't know what I don't know  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
Damn it's getting old  
  
I'm all locked up. I mean I did it again  
Couldn't recognize the feeling that you tried to fit in  
So I might kick back  
I think I'm taking my time  
Underneath the sun without a cloud in the sky  
  
It's almost easy  
It's got to easy  
To see it could happen to me  
  
What a feeling when it takes control of you  
Everything you need is back ten fold  
But like a feeling do it comes and goes then it's  
Gone  
  
Oh no  
  
Then the rain came knocked me sideways  
Hope the wind will break my fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
When the rain just falls on Sunday  
I don't know what I don't know  
Spend my days looking down a highway  
It's just getting old  
Damn it's getting old  
  
You told me you'd break my heart  
Sounds like something you say  
When you knew it from the start  
And it didn't matter anyway  
  
You told me you'd break my heart  
I didn't believe you then  
So why would I hear you now?  
You're undecided  
  
I know the rain may knock you sideways  
Hope the wind will break your fall  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
Damn, it's getting old  
  
When the rain just falls on Sunday  
I don't know what I don't know  
Spend my life looking down a highway  
Now it's getting old  
  
When the rain just knocks you sideways  
I've been lost since I don't know  
I know we all deserve a couple scars  
It's just getting old  
  
Oh, how it gets old.  
Damn it's getting old

Never say that nothing ever came from a mouse anyway  
Crawled into my house, took my cat away  
Don't let your brain tell your mind that it must say  
That nothing ever came from a mouse anyway  
Anyway  
  
Never say that nothing ever came from a gnat anyway  
Flew into my ear and then he done flown away  
Always causing aggravation so can't you ever say  
That nothing ever came from a gnat anyway  
Anyway, anyway, anyway  
  
Something always comes from the music anyway  
Came into my life and it stole me blues away  
Oh, my stereo is my best friend every day  
And this music is my blood, it's my blood  
It always comes and goes, but it never floods  
Something always comes, something always goes  
Something always comes from the music  
Something always comes from the music anyway  
Anyway, anyway, anyway  
  
Don't ya feel that this music flows  
Don't ya feel like it's life  
Well I do, well I certainly do  
I can't live without this music in my blood  
Well it gets me up when I'm feeling down  
And I cannot sleep when this music is around  
I live to move  
And I know that there's something there  
Filling me up, this music  
A wise man once said  
A wise man once said when he told me  
One good thing about music  
When it hits you, you feel no pain  
  
Something always comes and it always goes  
It will be there to the end after everything is gone  
The music  
Ah, it will, to the end  
Something always comes, something always goes  
Something always comes and it goes  
Something always comes from the music anyway  
Anyway, anyway, anyway

Are you low?  
Are you low?  
Take it slow  
Tried to live high ended up so low  
  
Can't believe this is real, somethings got to change  
Got to live my life, but I love to be strange  
Don't wanna be wrapped up in a typical package  
Ran away but couldn't find my way back  
Now I'm low  
I feel low  
  
Stuck in between, it's hard to explain  
Why every new beginning feels exactly the same  
And so I drink, drink still I am famished  
I want to go the distance but never quite finish  
  
Now I'm low  
I feel low  
Take it slow  
Try to live high and you end up low  
  
So here I reside in the middle of pride  
In the middle of the night I lost my ride  
And in a blink, blink everyone vanished  
I know your vision understands my condition  
Now I'm low  
Are you low?  
Take it slow  
Tried to live high, but I lost control  
Now I'm low  
Are you low?  
Take it slow  
Got to slow it down  
And regain control  
  
Pain might take you away from where you wanted to be  
I'm drawing the line  
Somewhere down below  
And then I'm gonna rise up  
Make my way back into the line up  
Oh, must let it go  
If the one-drop undertow tells you so  
Are you low?  
(Or are you waiting?)  
Are you low?  
(While the sun is fading)  
Down below  
(Why are you waiting?)  
You know you can't live high if you can't live low  
If you can't live low  
Are you low?  
(Or are you waiting?)  
Are you low?  
(While the sun is fading)  
Take me slow  
(Why are you waiting?)  
I know you want to be high, but you must be low  
Are you low?  
(Or are you waiting?)  
Are you low?  
(While the sun is fading)  
(Why are you waiting?)  
If you want to be high  
You've got to live low

I see you there,  
But you don't look right  
You got a ten mile stare,  
In your eyes tonight  
Time ain't fair,  
Like it used to be  
  
We're all dressed up,  
Nowhere to go  
We lost our way,  
About halfway home  
And we hurt the ones  
Who get too close  
  
Don't look back,  
You'll never find your way  
There's a million different people  
Who break the same way  
When everything has come undone,  
We got to bring it back to one  
Back to one  
We're all caught up  
In what used to be  
A grounded love,  
And some memories  
Why do I hurt the ones  
Who get close to me?  
Darling, are you listening?  
  
Don't look back,  
You'll never find your way  
There's a million different people  
Who break the same way  
Forget about the things we've done,  
And bring it back to one  
More night,  
Another's on the way  
We're all a little different,  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes undone,  
Bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one more night  
Bring it back to one  
Let's bring it back to one  
Bring it back to one  
It's just beyond my reach  
So bring me back to one  
  
I know forever always asks so much,  
Don't you let it scare you  
Don't you lose your touch  
And when your still waters start to run,  
Bring it back to one  
  
One more night,  
Another's on the way  
We're all a little different,  
But break the same way  
When everything becomes un-  
Everything becomes un-  
Don't look back  
We'll never find the way  
A million different people will break  
The same way  
When everything becomes undone,  
Bring it back to one

On the black rock is where I spend my time  
Writing a memory or writing a rhyme  
Thinking about what is right or wrong  
On the black rock is where I like to go  
After a long night comin' home from the show  
That's where I write my song all day long  
The black rock  
Sometimes, I just look around  
Taking the feeling coming out from the ground  
That's just something I do sometimes  
And then I just come out the door  
Taking the wind coming off of the shore  
And that's just what I'm doing tonight  
On the black rock is where I spend my time  
Writing a memory or writing a rhyme  
Thinking about what is right or wrong  
On the black rock is where I like to go  
After a long night comin' home from the show  
That's where I write my song all day long  
The black rock  
When you are on your own  
Not speaking out is like fighting alone  
And that is the worst damn way to fight  
And when you are scared no more  
You reach your hand out and just open the door  
And that's just what I'm doing tonight  
On the black rock is where I spend my time  
Writing a memory or writing a rhyme  
Thinking about what is right or wrong  
On the black rock is where I like to go  
After a long night comin' home from the show  
That's where I write my song all day long  
The black rock

Going on forever was never the plan,  
I'm just passing minutes staring down to my hands  
Man I gotta sing it, steal my heart, it can rest  
And something started burning in the back of my chest.  
  
All I ever asked for was a shot at the life,  
And when you gave it to me, must have started a fire.  
Burning for you..  
  
Fire  
Come on in and light up my heart  
Come on in and burn through my soul  
Come on turn the heat up  
Pick your feet up  
And let it burn.  
  
I know you got my back, oh I won't let you down  
Something 'bout these alleyways just turns me around.  
Could've been a night in a fight with the dark,  
Or maybe I'm a broken-heart in Battery Park.  
  
And all I ever asked for was a shot in the dark,  
And when you showed it to me, must've lit up a spark  
Burning for you..  
  
Fire  
Come on in and light up my heart  
Come on in and burn through my soul  
Come on turn the heat up  
Pick your feet up  
Sayin' ohhhh-ooh-oh  
  
Fire is burning in every one of us,  
Every one of us all.  
I wish I knew,  
How it was all so real.  
It was just too soon.  
  
Oh I got, somethings got to give  
I feel it inside, burning me out, the fire is real.  
Oh, you know, something's got to give.  
So bring down your walls,  
Down with 'em all,  
Let 'em fall.  
  
After we all started to crawl,  
The fire was real.  
After we all started to crawl,  
The fire was real.  
Looking away won't save the day,  
The fire is real.  
Inside us all, thousand feet tall,  
The fire is real.  
  
Fiiiiiire.  
  
Fire  
Come on in and light up my heart  
Come on in and burn through my soul  
Come on turn the heat up  
Pick your feet up  
Sayin' ohhhh-ooh-oh  
Fire is burning in every one of us.  
Sayin' ohhhh-ooh-oh  
Fire is burning in every one of us, every one of us

Is it me or does it seem  
That life just carries on?  
Now was it him who said  
That life is just a song?  
Now I don't know what will  
Keep me on this little Earth  
I just might use the love  
That's all in the dirt  
  
But every damn time  
That I see you  
I say to myself  
She ain't worth it  
She ain't worth nothing I got  
Ah no no  
Nah nah  
  
Was it you who said  
That my life is over?  
Baby it was over from the very start  
And did you say that I won't be  
Around downtown tomorrow?  
Ah yes I will with a hardened heart  
  
But every damn time  
That I see you  
I say to myself  
She ain't worth it  
She ain't worth nothing I got  
Ah no way  
Na uh  
  
She can have anything she wants  
But she really doesn't know  
About the way she taunts  
It's tearing me apart,  
It's tearing me apart  
Get Away, get up, and get away

From night to dawn  
You soldiered on, did ya?  
Each day is a gift  
But you led us strong  
And kept us on, did ya?  
Like each day is a gift  
  
I never thought that I'd be here with you  
Saying all these words that I have to  
But after all is said and all is done  
I never meant to ever hurt no one  
  
And nothing has to change  
You and I are strange  
Passing in the night  
Between the darkness and the rain  
  
At the crack of dawn  
You grab my arm, did ya?  
Each day was a gift  
You told me, "slow,  
Before I move on  
You must remember each day is a gift."  
I never understood what was for you  
Could never be for me this'll have to do  
But after all you said and all you've done  
I know you never meant to hurt no one  
  
Nothing has to change  
You and I can be strange  
Passing in the days  
Between the morning and the rain [Repeat: x 2]  
  
I can see you now  
Its like you were never gone  
  
From dusk to dawn  
You soldiered on  
Like each day was a gift  
Oh, you led us strong  
But you couldn't hold on  
And that's fine,  
'Cause each day was a gift  
  
I don't know when  
I'll be home  
So save a place for me 'til I get there  
I don't know when  
I'll be home  
So save a place for me  
  
For me [Repeat: x 4]

Baby don't you wait that long  
You told me underneath that song.  
But there's somethin' 'bout the way you move,  
Yeah it gets to me like a melody.  
  
I don't wanna wait all night,  
Cause soon it's gonna pass me by.  
I only wanna make you smile  
Let me get to you like I always do.  
  
Show me how you really feel  
Make it all go and disappear.  
We can dance into the night,  
Come together and we'll make it right.  
Come together and we'll make it.  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To make it all feel right.  
So don't apologize,  
You gotta be wrong sometimes.  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To live inside these lines,  
We were right all along.  
You gotta be wrong  
Gotta be wrong sometimes.  
  
Every little thing you say,  
Got me lifted and I'm on my way.  
Baby come with me, you don't have to stay.  
You follow me like a memory.  
  
Show me how you really feel,  
Make it all go and disappear,  
We can dance into the night,  
Come together and we'll make this right,  
Come together and we'll make it right.  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To make it all feel right.  
So don't apologize,  
You gotta be wrong sometimes.  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To live inside these lines,  
We were right all along.  
You gotta be wrong  
Gotta be wrong sometimes.  
  
Maybe the world will let us stay,  
Give us back what it took away.  
Or maybe I'm just high, so high.  
Somewhere out there in between,  
Being wrong and being clean,  
I see it all inside your eyes.  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To lose our mind  
I'm ready to fall, we gotta be wrong!  
  
You move like a melody,  
Everything they've got you've seen  
That's why you keep coming back to me for so long.  
We got to get wrong  
You move like a melody,  
Everything they've got you've seen  
That's why you keep holding on to me for so long.  
We got to get wrong  
  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To make it all feel right.  
So don't apologize,  
You gotta be wrong sometimes.  
We got more than a lifetime,  
To live inside these lines,  
We were right all along.  
You gotta be wrong,  
Gotta be wrong sometimes.

Woke up with a headache from the night before  
Cause sometimes I drink  
Spent the night with my head in the toilet bowl  
It's where I like to think  
I said cause I don't want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
La-da-da hey-o  
  
Ya ever spend all night thinking about your life  
Well I suggest we try  
Well it's something that you're gonna wanna do with the night  
Cause I tend to cry  
I said cause I don't want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
Lalalala had-ey-o  
  
Ya ever spent all day thinkin' bout the night  
It's something that you do  
When you think away too much you're out of sight  
What ya gonna doi said cause I don't want no one to take a piece of my heart  
I hate to lose all the little bitty pieces from my heart  
Lalalala had-ey-o

I just heard the world  
Is breaking down into bits again  
Tell me, what am I to do?  
You just want me to stay here  
So I'm just going to stay  
the home, our last resort  
I built a castle with an iron door  
Lock the window, pull the shades  
The hazed out sun won't help anyway  
if the world is crumbling down  
I don't want to be alone, no  
Locked up in this place  
I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
There's a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how you're  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
  
fear is bringing me here  
The television got me seeing unclear  
Bravery my neighbor, moved away  
Cause I don't need to be courageous today  
and If that world is crumbling down  
I don't want to be alone, no  
Locked up in this place  
when I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
There's a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how you're  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
There's a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how you're  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
nothing's gonna save me  
I'm hanging from the nearest tree  
Nothing's gonna save me  
I'm hanging from the nearest tree  
when I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
There's a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how you're  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
I heard the world up late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
There's a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how we're  
Caught up in the fight of your life  
  
when I heard the world of late night  
See I'm holding breath tight  
I'm trying to keep my head on right  
There's a chill in the air  
Nobody could care how we're  
We're caught up in the fight of our lives  
I heard the world of late night  
Holding my breath tight  
Trying to keep my head on right  
There's a chill in the air  
Nobody could care  
We're caught up in the fight of our lives

Eh-oh oh oh, eh-oh oh oh  
  
I'm underneath it all tonight  
Out my window there's a million lights  
Thousand hearts feeling just like me  
Man, it feels like Heaven out here in the street  
I know I got a lot to learn  
Breaking bottles only left me hurt  
Play with fire 'til I burn myself  
Don't you know that love will bring us somewhere else?  
  
So you take the left, I'll take the right  
Under arrest, we're under fire  
Oh oh oh oh  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
You take the low, I'll take the high  
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet  
Everybody got a problem with the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
Maybe I should take my time  
And build this life by my own design  
With no direction that is in between  
Everything I love and everything I need  
So bring it back, all I want is understanding  
To live my life the way that I planned it  
Wouldn't change a thing  
Man, it feels like Heaven underneath my feet  
  
So you take the left, I'll take the right  
Under arrest, we're under fire  
Oh oh oh oh  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
You take the low, I'll take the high  
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet  
Everybody got a problem with the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
So raise 'em up, raise 'em up  
All I ever wanted was a shot at your love  
I know, and I believe  
Everything we got is everything we need  
Oh, love will get you higher  
I set my heart on fire  
I know, it's what you see  
Don't wanna go to Heaven if they don't want me  
  
'Cause I'm no criminal  
I'm not your enemy  
All I have is life  
And I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
So you take the left, I'll take the right  
Under arrest, we're under fire  
Oh oh oh oh  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
You take the low, I'll take the high  
You lock the gate, I hear the quiet  
Everybody got a problem with the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
Oh, yeah, raise 'em up, raise 'em up  
Everything you wanted is inside your cup  
Drink up  
Love will get you higher  
Oh, oh, all that your rhythm needs  
I never met no criminal  
And in the end I'll do it again  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in  
  
Oh, I'm not a criminal  
Yeah, I'm no enemy  
It's just the way I live  
I don't wanna go to Heaven if I can't get in

Well there was a time when life caught you by surprise.  
What you see going by is a shadow.  
You've got to live in front of your eyes.  
In a typical way we stray, checking back with the past.  
In a typical day we'll stay to see what's gonna last.  
But I didn't mind at all.  
  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
  
Well there was a place we'd chase through the woods in my juvenile days.  
What a typical waste of space, what a wonderful place to stay.  
But I could have cried but I just left my soul to fly.  
And I could have chilled at will, but I didn't know how to die.  
But I didn't mind at all.  
  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
  
No, I've been woken, and I have been broken.  
But this time it's gonna change  
For,  
I've been lazy, and I been crazy.  
Has been stolen,  
But from,  
From this day on I swear to you true.  
From this day on I swear to you.  
Well there was at time when I could have flown out of the room.  
Yet I didn't care just where I was going after noon.  
Though I didn't know and I chose to live my life so fair.  
And I could have died, but I chose to live here instead  
But I didn't mind at all.  
  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
I didn't mind at all  
  
I've been woken, and I have been broken  
But this time its gonna change  
For, I've been lazy and I have been crazy  
But this time it's not hazy at all  
Cause I've been,  
I've been chose my heart has been stolen  
But from,  
From this day on, I swear to you true.  
From this day on, I swear to you true.  
I say now way back when you and all your friends  
Had some good times we should do this again we'd say  
Hey, hey, hey we should do this again, we'd say.  
But in the mean meanwhile, I'll just walk the mile.  
I won't look back won't forget your smile  
Oh no, hey hey hey we should do this again, we'd say.  
But I swear to you true.  
From this day on I swear to you true I swear I do I.  
  
No.  
I won't give you back.  
No.  
Won't give you back.  
No.  
Won't give you back.  
No.  
Can't give you back.  
No.  
I won't give you back my baby.  
Said I can't give you back.  
No.  
Said I won't give you back.  
No.  
I swear to you true.  
  
From this day on I swear to you true.  
I swear.  
I do, I.  
God, I do.  
My baby, I swear to you true.  
I swear, I do.

I took this girl out last night and we left around 12,  
We walked along lonely streets and got to know ourselves,  
I like to read, she likes to write,  
She likes to sleep, and I like to stay up all night,  
My friends say I'm crazy and I agree,  
But that's okay cause that the way she likes to be  
  
I say now hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,  
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go  
I said hey girl, come with me, and let yourself go, go, go, let yourself go  
  
Well we went out late that night and we danced through the night  
I was holding on to her and she was gripping me tight  
But I didn't care, and she didn't mind  
I was unaware that she liked to act so kind,  
My friends say she's crazy and I agree,  
But that's okay cause that's the way I like to be  
  
Hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,  
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go, go, go,  
Sayin now, just let yourself go  
  
Later on that night I took her home,  
I asked if she felt alright being alone  
So I went inside, she didn't mind,  
Took two to decide that I wasn't going home tonight  
I see we're both crazy, that's alright with me,  
The night was kind of hazy that's the way it's gonna be  
  
I say now hey girl, come with me and let yourself go,  
Hey girl come with me and let yourself go, go, go,  
Saying now, just let yourself go, go, go,  
Just let yourself go, go, go-oh  
Let yourself go

It's been a long, long time since I lost myself.  
Put my pride down on the table, put my fear on the shelf.  
So I bought myself a throne to reside and let myself go.  
But I've traveled much too far, where I've gone, I'll never know.  
  
What a long, long time...  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain...  
  
Losing my mind.  
What a long, long time.  
What a long, long time.  
My days I've spet relaxin' turned to nights relaxin' too  
  
A thousand eyes upon me, but my sights are missing you.  
So this time I swear I will loosen my grip.  
On past times and bad lines and meaningless trips.  
What a long, long time.  
  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain,  
Losing my mind.  
  
What a long, long time.  
What a long, long time.  
So, over and over mile signs pass by my side  
The more you try to find yourself, the more you tend to hide  
  
Behind these - forest trees - and greens that blind your eyes  
To lounge upon that throne I bought,  
Confer there with the wise.  
What a long, long time.  
  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain,  
Losing my mind.  
  
What a long, long time,  
Long time...yeah.  
So here we appear, the rest lost themselves in a pit of fear.  
For who? What can I do? But let them all come through the wall  
  
And though some oppose, many of these things I know,  
I'll stay here alone, and lose myself on the riverways of days.  
I'm coming home.  
What a long, long time.  
  
Long, long time.  
It's been a little old while since I felt so fine.  
Wanderin' in the rain,  
Losing my mind  
  
What a long, long time.  
What a long, long time.

Time is the only thing certain  
When your staring down your son  
And your days will not be forgotten  
If you live them as they come  
When nobody wants to be just your best friend  
Without competition  
With nothing to hide  
Watching your back doubles up your vision  
I make no decisions with unsteady eyes  
  
This world is not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
This world was never free for me  
But it will be for you  
Listen true  
When you fall  
Get up again  
I know this life might be hard to live  
But It's not for me my love  
It's all for you  
  
I tired to vanish  
Into the shadows  
I tired to get away from it all  
I couldn't manage  
Imagine this life  
With nothing to leave you at all  
Then somebody picked me up  
With the quickness  
Wrapped me in blankets  
Of patience and love  
Brought me back from a broken existence  
I feel no resistance to rising above  
  
This world is not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
I'll tell you true  
This world was never free for me  
But it will be for you  
That's what I'll do  
If you fall get up again  
I know that life might be hard to live  
But it's not for me anymore  
It's all for you  
  
You know it's not for me  
Oh no no  
Not for me  
Oh no no  
I know it's not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
  
Not for me  
Oh no no  
This is not for me  
Oh no no  
This is not for me  
Oh no no  
This is not for me  
Oh no no  
  
And when you fall get up one more time  
This life is yours for the taking  
Not mine  
Don't be afraid where you came from  
Oh, man  
You'll take it somewhere new  
This world is not for me, my love  
It's all for you  
You know it's all for you  
  
If you fall get up again  
I know this life can be hard to live  
If you got love  
You should give love  
Get back love  
Take it home with you  
It's not for me, my love  
It's just for you

In a way, I need a change  
From this burnout scene  
Another time, another town  
Another everything  
But it's always back to you  
  
Stumble out, in the night  
From the pouring rain  
Made the block, sat and thought  
There's more I need  
It's always back to you  
  
But I'm good without ya  
Yeah, I'm good without you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter?  
Over the line can't define what I'm after  
I always turn the car around  
Give me a break let me make my own pattern  
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered  
I always turn the car around  
  
I had no idea that the night  
Would take so damn long  
Took it out, on the street  
While the rain still falls  
Push me back to you  
  
But I'm good without ya  
Yeah, I'm good without you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter?  
Over the line can't define what I'm after  
I always turn the car around  
Give me a break let me make my own pattern  
All that it takes is some time but I'm shattered  
I always turn the car around  
  
Give it up, give it up, baby  
Give it up, give it up, now  
Now  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter?  
Over the line can't define what I'm after  
I always turn the car around  
All that I feel is the realness I'm faking  
Taking my time but it's time that I'm wasting  
Always turn the car around  
  
How many times can I break till I shatter?  
Over the line can't define what I'm after  
I always turn the car around  
  
Don't wanna turn that car around  
I gotta turn this thing around

He walks these streets some nights until way past twelve.  
His mind can't decide if he's in heaven...he just can't tell.  
He sees her standing there, smiling by the lamp post shine.  
His heart can't remember ever feeling, oh, so fine.  
  
She gone.  
She not coming back, no way.  
She gone.  
She not coming back to stay.  
  
She gone.  
And as she turns away his eyes lost in her back.  
His feet continue down some ancient railroad track.  
And right then, right there he sees that he's done wrong.  
  
And as he opens his eyes, realizes that she gone.  
Well, she gone, she not coming back, no way.  
She gone, she not coming back to stay.  
Well, she gone, she never coming back again.  
  
She gone, what's he gonna do 'til then?  
She gone.  
She gone.  
She gone.  
  
She gone so far away.  
She gone.

I woke today, felt another way,  
Everything was gonna be fine.  
My head rose up then my legs came too,  
Quarter past nine was the time.  
  
I used to lose floating memories, found myself  
Wishing I'd remember old times.  
But I woke today,  
Felt another way,  
  
Felt free in the sky to fly.  
I stepped out the door, didn't know what for,  
I saw my lady walking along.  
I could have cried out what I wanted to say,  
  
But I am sick of all this terrible charm.  
I used to be into apologies, a regular to shame I  
Was shy.  
But I woke today,  
  
Felt another way,  
Felt free in the sky to fly.  
Well I'm through the gate, got to my house about  
A quarter to eight.  
  
And I made a drink, got about an hour to relax and  
Just think.  
I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same  
Anymore.  
  
And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I  
Was off to a regular day.  
The morning dragged on, I was walking along,  
Missing pieces fell to the ground.  
  
Apparently, I could not see,  
But I saw everything going down.  
So I packed my bags and I was on my way,  
I feel a little different in a different way.  
  
But like I said when I got out of bed, I was off to a  
Regular day.  
I could not hide, I wore my pride,  
It felt good to be on the run.  
  
The air quality was something new to me and I got  
Along fine with the sun.  
And when I rest my heard and I lay down to bed,  
I put the pieces down with the blame.  
  
And if all goes well, at the morning bell,  
I'll wake feeling free just the same.  
Well I'm through the gate, got to my house about  
A quarter to eight.  
  
And I made a drink, got about an hour to relax and  
Just think.  
I'm just bored, nothing's ever gonna be the same  
Anymore.  
  
And with my drink in hand I got up to stand and I  
Was off to a regular day.

Who's that with his arm around you?  
He making eyes at you that way  
He looks in love  
He looks familiar  
Damn it's me  
Never thought I'd see that day  
It's like I came to sleep and there was darkness  
Well I'm holding the daylight by your voice  
Not that I have any choice  
  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that it's forever and it's overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
  
And now we're talking about our future  
Oh and our futures wide open  
Cause your love is the best place I've ever been  
It was you to the rescue  
And I mention that I'd never felt like this before  
I'm powerless to fight it anymore  
  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that it's forever and it's overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
  
Used to watch this game from the sidelines  
Now it's time to get on in and play  
You've been waiting there for me for my whole life  
Now it's all you  
Now it's all you  
  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
Someone that I used to be  
But he is through  
Know that it's forever and it's overdue  
Something coming over me  
I know it's you  
I know  
I know it's you baby  
I know it's you

Oh my  
20 throw down in my fist of rage  
And the man to my left has folded down  
Well Johnny doubled up with a royal flush  
  
I had three jacks and a pair of nines  
My mind is turning - just two shots more  
There's not much left to play  
Well then dude walks in, black hat on top  
  
What am I, if I'm lucky  
Wasn't a county cop  
'Cause I'm just runnin out of time  
Who's up for game two  
  
What to do  
My wallet's gettin thin  
And I just lost my watch last night  
Well I gotta problem  
  
Just one answer  
Gotta throw it all down  
And kiss it goodbye  
Yeah!  
  
That was a crazy game of poker  
(That was a crazy game of poker)  
I lost it all  
(I lost it all)  
  
But someday I'll be back again  
And I, never to fold.  
(Never to fold)  
Who's up for game three  
  
I can barely see the bourbon drowning next to me  
And I just lost it all  
Well there's a man sittin next to me  
Red, was smiling  
  
'Cause it's funny  
I don't have no money tonight  
Yeah  
That was a crazy game of poker

(Never to fold)  
Bop bop bop...  
I say now skittleedat dat,  
  
Well how bout that?  
I'm coming out the front never coming out the back  
And I walked into the bar yesterday  
'Cause I had something to do, something to say  
  
And Johnny walked in right behind me  
And I didn't turn around  
'Til I heard the sound of his feet  
Falling on the ground  
  
I looked over my shoulder and I saw a clown  
And I said what'cha doin' in the bar tonight.  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah  
Jahova!  
And I said, what'cha looking at?  
  
He hit me across the face with a bat  
I grabbed my .45 and I said let's get out and go  
So he opened the door and said  
Do what you're here for  
  
I said I'm wandering round the road four to four  
And I said I been walking  
For about a thousand years.  
And my feet are growing tired  
  
My eyes a little wired  
Don't know what to do unless I retire  
And he just said let's play some crazy poker  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
  
I say revolution, and you say die  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say die dah dah  
Day day oh!  
  
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw  
I said that, was the craziest game of poker that I ever saw  
But I'm not gonna quit and I'm not gonna stop  
Don't give a shit cause I got the drop  
  
Johnny just got two eyes just like mine  
And I'm feeling kinda funky, kinda fine  
And I drank a bottle of whiskey, 'fore I came  
Came to the bar to see what's the same  
  
I saw my man named Johnny sittin' across the table from me  
And to my left was a man, he had no chin  
Didn't really think about starting a scene  
The man to my right wasn't feeling kinda nice  
  
He looked kinda mad and I felt bad  
Because I took his money last night it's kinda funny  
But now I'm just struggling  
I need a honey-bunny.  
  
I don't know what to say anymore  
So I'm just gonna go out, anywho...  
So I said Johnny whatcha doing tonight?  
He looked at me with a face full of fright  
  
And I said, how bout a revolution?  
And he said right.  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah  
  
I say of, you say a  
I say revolution, and you say jah jah jah jahova  
Javhova, is watching over me  
Day day oh!

Light of the candle, bright one's soul shined  
Woke up new morning feeling better than ever, fine  
Chest no hurt no more, something feel better  
What's all the hate for, now something feel better  
  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
Walk through the valley and I'll follow the stars  
I feel it so close now, it can't be that far  
Time some grow lonely, but time isn't done  
  
It's time to go home now, you're not on the run  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
One step forward and I crossed the line again  
  
One step forward and I crossed the line again  
Standing on the edge of a civilization  
No one's around  
Standing on the edge of a civilization  
  
And no one's around and I ain't heard a sound, yeah  
The path is snowed over, the path lies ahead  
Soon we'll be down there, and nothing is said  
There's no need to fear love, don't let love hide  
  
Conquer the mountains way down by the riverside  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I  
To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I, To Zion goes I

Hoping to find something better  
At least better than what ya thought  
So many aisles to venture down  
So many choices you thought  
  
Then a man come walkin down the aisle  
With a smile as wide as the rain  
But mom she's gotta go away again  
And I'm runnin with the pain  
  
Yeah, la la la la  
You ask yourself why you can't stay just five more minutes alone  
And walk away  
You know it, mom knows it, so whatcha want  
  
She says, one toy today, she says  
Why only one or another or none at all  
How come every time I trip I never fall  
Then a man he come walkin down the aisle with a smile as wide as the rain  
  
But mom she gotta go away again and I'm runnin with the pain  
Yah la la la la  
Yah la la la la  
You ask yourself why you can't stay just five more minutes alone  
  
And walk away  
You know it, mom knows it, so whatcha want  
She says, one toy today  
So many aisles to venture down  
  
And there's nothin lookin nice  
How come every time I look once, I have to look twice  
But mom she's comin round the bend  
And I'm buyin another toy  
  
And she said son just come along with me  
But I'm runnin with the boys  
Yah la la la  
Yah la la la  
  
You ask yourself why you can't stay just five more minutes alone  
And walk away  
You know it, mom knows it, so whatcha want  
She says, one toy today, she says

It's been such a long day  
Followed by long nights  
Sit here by my myself  
But it just don't feel alright  
You been talking to me  
Everyone talking at me like  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Try me  
I'll let you live  
I'll let you breathe  
Try me  
I'll pick you up  
And make you believe  
  
You're surrounded and scared, ain't ya?  
Nobody's there for you  
Under it all  
They don't shine away, you do  
But you're tangled up in  
Everything wrong for you  
Come on back to me  
And I will make it be the one  
Everyone talking at ya  
Everyone coming at ya like  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
I know it's been such a long time  
And I still don't let you in  
I know it feels like a long time  
But you're never coming back again  
Are you ever coming back again?  
  
It's been such a long day  
Followed the long nights  
Sit here by myself  
And it just don't feel alright  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Try me (I'll make you believe)  
Try me  
Come on try me (I'll make you believe)

I'll pick you up  
And make you believe

Blue light rain, whoa unbroken chain,  
Looking for familiar faces in an empty window pane.  
  
Listening for the secret, searching for the sound  
But I could only hear the preacher and the baying of his hounds.  
  
Willow sky, whoa, I walk and wonder why,  
They say love your brother, but you will catch it when you try.  
  
Roll you down the line boy, drop you for a loss,  
Ride you out on a cold railroad and nail you to a cross.  
  
November and more, as I wait for the score,  
They're telling me forgiveness is the key to every door.  
A slow winder day a night like forever,  
Sink like a stone, float like a feather.  
  
(instrumental)  
Lilac rain, unbroken chain, Song of the sawhet owl.  
Out on the mountain, it'll drive you insane, Listening to the winds howl  
  
Unbroken chain of sorrow and pearls, Unbroken chain of shy and sea.  
Unbroken chain of the western wind, Unbroken chain of you and me.

Oh my God  
Tell me this won't last forever  
Tell me that I'm not alone  
Tell me this will come together now  
  
Packed my things up just the other day  
Said my goodbyes to all these things I've sayed  
Out in the driveway we laugh under the moon  
Among my friends for now but I'll be leavin' soon  
  
Many days from now I'm sure  
I'll be back among your graces  
And with you I won't pretend  
No not at all, Oh  
  
Crack the morning, up and running quick  
No sleep again last night  
That's the way it is  
Out in the open under broken skies  
I feel every foot step I see everybody's eyes  
  
Oh and this is summer, in another world  
Far from the driveway and my baby girl  
Soon come the winter and with it quiet nights  
And darker days and darker fights  
  
Many days from now I'm sure  
I'll be back among your faces  
And with you I won't pretend  
No not at all  
  
Oh, the theater is burnin over at midnight  
But never like this  
Hot under the fire, the stars are a fallin  
But never like this  
No, I hope you never see this  
  
Wait, wait for my love  
Don't forget me never let me go  
If you wait, wait for my love  
I'll remember never let you go  
  
Until I'm fine, fine, fine  
Until I'm fine, fine, fine  
  
To be back in my room  
I have the same dream every night  
Just me, among my things  
No one else is there, there's no one left to fight, just me  
  
Among my things  
Many nights from now I know  
I'll be back among your graces  
Until then I'll just pretend  
That I'm not cold  
  
Oh my god, tell me this won't last forever  
And tell me that I'm not alone  
Tell me this will come together  
Oh my God you know  
  
Wait, wait for my love  
Don't forget me never let me down  
And just wait, wait for my love  
I'll remember every one of you  
  
And just wait, wait for my love  
Wait, wait for my love  
Wait for my love  
  
Until I'm fine, fine, fine  
Until I'm fine, fine, fine  
I'll be fine, fine, fine  
I'll be fine, fine, fine

Iron winter, got me cold  
Convicted like a criminal  
Sharp and nimble, the wind unfold  
Got me to my feet again  
Past the mountain I hear a cry  
Coming from the pinnacle  
Oh, In the distance a city shines  
Oh, what a welcoming  
  
[Bridge]  
Been to the black rock  
Found my salvation  
Rendered me patient  
But wearing me thin  
So I'm  
  
[Chorus]  
On the way back home  
Seen the big show, thousand times  
Got to get back what is mine  
The only way I know  
Feet been walking, thousand miles  
Got to get back what is mine  
  
Bless the evening, it's showed the way  
Back to where it all began  
Oh, undercover I made my case  
I'm quietly a gentleman  
Man, To be a fool is such a waste  
He'll eat until he's sick of it  
Why not stop when you find your place  
And be happy that you made it in  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What is mine  
Fallen time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On the way back home  
I'm on my way  
You know I'm on my way back  
The only way I know  
  
Getting what is mine  
Gonna get it back, give it back now  
I've come so far tonight

Tell me I'm dreaming  
My feet are stone and my light is dim  
Chasing this demon on his way down  
  
But whatever happened?  
Whatever happened?  
  
Spent the night out on a hill  
And watched the world sleep sound and still  
And over mountains darkness spilled  
Washed me over  
  
Whatever happened?  
Whatever happened?  
  
Its been a long way back  
From the edge of that  
Saw the world from a hill  
And right back where it started  
And it still feels right  
Like the very first time  
Saw the world like a kid  
Yesterday is over,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
City gates of rusted iron  
Can't contain the light inside  
So I spot this devil at the county line,  
And went no further  
  
And whatever happened?  
Whatever happened?  
  
Its been a long way back  
From the edge of that  
Saw the world from a hill  
And right back where it started  
And it still feels right  
Like the very first time  
Saw the world like a kid  
Yesterday is over,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
After all the time is gone,  
I'll have moved on  
  
Its been a long way back  
From the edge of that  
When the world was a kid  
And right back where it started  
And it still feels right  
Like the very first night  
Saw the world like a kid,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
I saw the world from a hill,  
Lets write another story tonight!  
  
I saw the world like a kid,  
Lets write another story,  
Write another story tonight!

I wrote a letter to man, sealed my envelope with hope and a stamp  
Give me a minute and I'll be on my way  
Cause I got something for y'all today  
Well I was walking yesterday, I gave you a smile and then you turned  
I said nothing cause that's all that I could say  
I said nothing cause that's all that I could say  
Give it back to me  
Let me go, let me go, let me go home  
Well I was thinking yesterday, about what I would do and maybe what I would
say  
If I had that minute, if I had it back today  
Cause I got something for y'all today  
Give it back to me  
Let me go, let me go, when can I go, when can I go home?  
You find yourself by alone  
Wondering what to do so you pick up the phone  
But she doesn't say a thing and she isn't even home  
But that's okay because you're on your own  
Let me go, let me go, when can I go home?  
  

A pattern sunrise, swept  
Along the way a sunrise.  
And under these overpasses,  
A towering mountain does rise.  
Don't cross the river not over there,  
There'll be a mystery revealed,  
And I bet you dare.  
And if I am to seek this place you can see,  
Who's chariot to follow so I, can be free?  
  
At night the stars cry,  
I gaze upon a lake of backyard,  
And under these overpasses,  
A towering mountain does lie.  
Don't cross the river not over there,  
There'll be a mystery revealed,  
That were meant to share.  
So if I am to seek this place you can see,  
Who's chariot to follow so I, can be free?  
  
Oh No, here we are again.  
Oh No, here we are again.  
  
My momma told me,  
"Don't go 'cross that river,  
Because you might not make it back,  
The beast gonna eat your heart."  
She said, "Don't go out there,  
Stay upon your track.  
This money has torn my family apart,  
And I cannot buy it back."  
So of course I built my boat,  
And I was half upon my way.  
When I got to the other side,  
The water came rushing down,  
Washed me away.  
  
Who's Chariot? Who's Chariot? Who's Chariot?  
Chariot? Who's Chariot? Whose Chariot?  
Chariot? Chariot? Who's Chariot?  
Chariot? Chariot?  
  
Freedom, Freedom, Who's Chariot?  
Freedom, Freedom, Who's Chariot?  
Freedom, Freedom, Who's Chariot?  
Who's Chariot? Take me home!  
Take me home.  
  
Oh No, said I'm out that door again,  
I left my house, my money,  
And my dearest friend.  
I'm not going back jack.  
I cross the river got a little  
Bit of business that I'm doing today.  
You didn't feel me,  
You can't really see no good,  
I made my life out a stack of wood.  
I've been moving cross the river today,  
But Who's Chariot?  
Take me home! Take me home.  
  
Whose chariot? Take me home.  
Hallaluyah! Coming home.  
Chariot, gotta, where will you take me.  
Chariot will ya, will ya take me.  
Chariot will ya, will ya take me.  
Oh Chariot would ya pick me up, take me.  
Oh Chariot, gotta, oh will you take me!  
Chariot just pick me up and take me!  
Oh Chariot, come and get me.  
Who's Chariot? Take me home!  
Take me home.

It was a hot hot day, middle of may,  
Saw my baby walking my way,  
She is the cutest thing I've ever seen,  
She's got the black black hair,  
Little black dress,  
And a suit of pair  
Little hunny she walked up to me

We don't have no time to stop that day,  
That day was a wonderful day, that day ,  
Was the best damn day that day

I done lost my mind a thousand times,  
And you would too  
If you see the things I do,  
Oo my baby she burns my world down,  
And I cannot thank her enough  
For letting me wear the crown,  
And one day she walk up to me  
And that was the best damn day
