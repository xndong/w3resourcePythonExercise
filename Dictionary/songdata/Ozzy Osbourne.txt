Innocents raped with napalm fire

You think it's all the same but I want you to believe I could be  
So like you  
By now you've figured out that I want you educated cause it's  
So like you  
  
Because it's all the same  
I could be something like you  
Because it's all the same  
Watch you kill for me  
  
Everytime I want to and everyday I will be  
So like you  
Hitting on the helpless smoking with the infants cause it's  
Just like you  
  
So hidden in the picture  
I'm wrapping the world around me  
They've been insisting there's no difference between us  
  
Don't listen turn around  
People might just see you  
Now make yourself a part of me  
A part of me to let you go

[Mott the Hoople cover]  
  
Billy rapped all night about his suicide  
How he'd kick it in the head when he was 25  
Sweet guy, don't wanna stay alive when you're 25  
  
Wendy's stealing clothes from marks and sparks

It's a real mean team  
We can love  
We can love  
And my brother's back at home  
With his beatles and his stones  
We never got if off on that revolution stuff  
It was such a drag, too many snags  
Well I drunk a lot of wine  
And I'm feeling fine  
Gonna race some cat to bed  
Is this concrete all around me, or is it in my head?

It's in the life that we lead  
Set up for money and greed  
As if it isn't enough  
We have to use it all up  
Success  
Excess  
The truth is inconvenient  
  
All in your head, the reasons, let us forget  
You kept your pride in this land  
  
How could you think nothing's wrong  
You won't be smiling for long  
When it's all gone, gone, we can never go back  
  
Gone into the end, at my spend  
Watching the rain come down  
Turn your head away, ignore the fear  
Watching the ice crash down  
  
How 'bout a justice exposure  
How could you screw us all over  
Rape, steal, and murder  
Got us the almighty dollar  
The almighty dollar  
  
Poison the air that we breathe  
Change your industrial need  
Destroy the soul that you steal, the radiation is real  
Beat fate, too late, you built and fueled the fire  
  
You killed my faith, my whole earth desecrate  
Deceived the whole human race  
I know you think nothing's wrong  
We won't be breathing for long  
When it's all gone, gone  
We can never go back  
  
Gone into the end, at my spend  
Watching the rain come down  
Turn your head away, ignore the fear  
Watching the ice crash down  
  
How 'bout a justice exposure  
How could you fuck us all over  
Rape, steal, and murder  
Got us the almighty dollar  
  
Dead human disaster  
The point of no return  
No thing like ever after  
Is it too late to learn  
  
Gone into the end, at my spend  
Watching the rain come down  
Turn your head away, ignore the fear  
Watching the ice crash down  
  
How 'bout it's just an exposure  
How could you fuck us all over  
Rape, steal, and murder, got us the almighty dollar  
The almighty dollar

I get up and I get down  
I don't know how to take it  
All the pain makes me scream and shout  
I wonder if I'll make it  
I love the feeling when the magic is just right  
There's no revealing what is hidden in the night  
Riding on a train that I can't control  
No one else to blame and I can't let go  
In the darkness I can feel  
The things that makes me crazy  
Hands of madness cold as steel  
I find it quite amazing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and the seeds I have to sow  
Riding on a train that I can't control  
No one else to blame and I can't let go  
It's calling me, It's calling me  
It's calling me, It's calling me  
I'm riding on a train that I can't control  
See no evil, fear no fright  
Never lose the living  
Keep the targets in your sight  
Know the cards you're dealing  
Never forsaking what a dreamer needs to know  
Rules meant for breaking and I gotta let, I gotta it go  

Screams break the silence  
Waking from the dead of night  
Vengeance is boiling  
He's returned to kill the light  
Then when he's found who he's looking for  
Listen in awe and you'll hear him  
  
Bark at the moon  
  
Years spent in torment  
Buried in a nameless grave  
Now he has risen  
Miracles would have to save  
Those that the beast is looking for  
Listen in awe and you'll hear him  
  
Bark at the moon  
  
They cursed and buried him  
Along with shame  
And thought his timeless soul had gone  
In empty burning Hell-unholy one  
But now he's returned to prove them wrong  
  
Howling in shadows  
Living in a lunar spell  
He finds his heaven  
Spewing from the mouth of hell  
  
And when he finds who he's looking for  
Listen in awe and you'll hear him  
Bark at the moon

You load the dice and paint the smile upon your face  
With fingers crossed you switch the perfume with the mace  
What kind of dreams to you enjoy inside your bed  
I'll face the lies and shake the evil from your head  
  
Black Illusion  
Is all I ever see  
Black Illusion  
I bring you misery  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
You always seem to know the answer to it all  
You seem to cheat the truth and never take the fall  
Your life is hollow and you simply the rules  
The time will come when you will join the other fools  
  
Black Illusion  
Is all I ever see  
Black Illusion  
I bring you misery  
Oh yeah  
Yeah  
  
I load the dice and fake a smile upon my face  
With fingers crossed I switch the perfume with the mace  
What kind of dreams do I enjoy inside my bed  
You'll face the lies and shake the evil from my head  
  
Black Illusion  
Is all I ever see  
Black Illusion  
I bring you misery  
Oh yeah  
Yeah

What is this that stands before me  
Figure in black which points at me  
Turn 'round quick and start to run  
Find out I'm the chosen one  
  
Oh, no  
  
Big black shape with eyes of fire  
Telling people their desire  
Satan sitting there, he's smiling  
Watches those flame get higher and higher  
  
Oh, god, lease help me  
Oh, no, no  
  
Child cries out for its mother  
Mother screaming in the fire  
Satan points at me again  
Opens the door to push me in  
  
Oh, no  
Oh, god  
  
Is it the end my friend  
Satan's coming 'round the bend  
People running 'cause they're scared  
You people better go and beware  
  
No, no  
Please, god, no

How does it feel  
To treat me like you do  
When you layed your hands upon me  
And told me who you are  
  
I thought I was mistaken  
I thought I heard your words  
But tell me how I feel  
Tell me know how do I feel.  
  
How does it feel  
How should I feel  
Tell me how does it feel  
To treat me like you do  
  
Those who came before me  
Lived through thier vacations  
From the past until completion  
They will turn away no more  
  
I still find it so hard  
To say what I need to say  
But I'm quite sure that you'll tell me  
Just how I should feel today  
  
I see a ship in the harbor  
I can and shall obey  
But if it wasn't for your misfortunes  
I'd be a heavenly person to day  
  
I thought I was mistaken  
I thought I heard you speak  
Tell me how do I feel  
Tell me know how should I feel  
  
Now I stand here waiting  
  
I thought I told you to leave me  
When I walked down to the beach  
Tell me how does it feel  
When your heart grows cold  
  
How does it feel  
How should I feel  
Tell me how does it feel  
To treat me like you do

Listen my son  
One thing I've learned  
And I know it  
Bombers can open bomb bays  
  
Love all you can  
This precious thing  
Called your own life  
Remember bombers can open bomb bays  
  
Might you meet somebody  
That has your mothers eyes and smile  
Might you meet them  
Don't blow them away  
Don't hurt them  
Just hold me  
Make someone happy  
  
The things you do  
It's up to you  
Try being happy  
And I say I can believe it  
And I do  
I do believe there's hope for you  
  
[Bridge:]  
You, there's hope for you (2x)  
  
(Solo)  
  
Listen my son  
I'm in a war and I know it  
Remember bombers can open bomb bays  
  
Complimentary worship  
May close your many open doors  
Might you be cool  
Don't get blown away  
Don't hurt you  
Just hold you  
And make you happy  
  
The things you do  
It's up to you  
Try being happy  
And I say I can believe it  
And I do  
I do believe there's hope for you

So sick and tired of living  
And so afraid to die  
I've lived so many lives  
And still I wonder why  
The way the world perceives me  
Is not the way I am  
The one half thinks I'm crazy  
The other thinks I'm mad  
  
I spent a long long time alone in my room  
I need your help to get me out of this gloom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
Ten thousand million nightmares  
Temptation by the score  
I used to get so high  
And still I wanted more  
You think my time is wasted  
In search of who I am  
I tried to so hard to kill  
The boy inside the man  
  
I spent a thousand years one night in my room  
I've lived so many lives and that is my doom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
I never thought I'd smile again  
Always thought I'd be here on my own  
Sometimes when I'm down  
You come and save me again  
And again  
And again  
And again  
  
I'll never understand it  
It makes no sense at all  
Just look at what I've done  
It's time to count the score  
  
I've spent a long long time alone in my room  
I need your help to get me out of this gloom  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out  
  
Can you hear them  
All the voices in my head  
They freak me out  
Can you hear them  
They won't be happy 'till I'm dead  
They freak me out

There's no present there's no future  
I don't even know about the past  
It's all timeless and never ending  
To take it in it's all too vast  
  
It goes, forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tomorrow  
  
Journey to the center of eternity  
Journey to the center of eternity  
  
The time is coming but also going  
And it's leaving never to return  
Maybe forever it could be heaven  
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn  
  
It goes, forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tomorrow  
  
I got to travel forever  
It's all within my mind  
An endless path to endeavor  
But forever is a long long time  
  
There's no secrets and no corruption  
In the center of infinity  
There's no limits in non-existence  
And no beginning to my destiny  
  
It goes, forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tomorrow  
  
Journey to the center of eternity  
Journey to the center of eternity

Found exploding, and tears are growing  
Chasing rockets and grasping my head  
They can call it justice, a retribution  
But the reasons are never clear  
  
Freedom is just mans' invention  
And a soldier is just a slave  
Self inflicted  
So addicted  
Our habits are hard to break  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm alive  
Watching better turn to worse  
(Watching better turn to worse)  
One more time  
Try to civilize the universe  
(Civilize the universe)  
  
Without the righteous  
Without the faithful  
We would never accept the obscene  
  
A false confession, and priest's obsession  
Is the demon the light to be seen  
Burn the witch and hang his head as  
There's only one choice to be made  
With thought restricted  
And heart afflicted  
The truth be so hard to take  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The righteous and the faithful  
Give the good man to the blind  
The world full of confusion  
From every disease confined  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
Try to civilize the universe  
(Civilize the universe)

Well I know where you live  
I know you live alone  
I'll pay a visit in your darkest hour  
I've got a treat in store  
Won't be the same no more  
And I will demonstrate my holy power  
  
Devil's daughter  
You don't want a holy war.  
Devil's daughter  
You don't want a holy war  
  
You know what I'm about  
I'll cast the demons out  
And I'll persist until the battle's won  
I'll feel your creeping flesh  
If you're to be possessed  
Then I will desecrate what you've become  
  
Devil's daughter  
You don't want a holy war  
Devil's daughter  
  
The time has come at last  
Your future days have past  
No use in fighting battles you can't win  
The final conflict's lost  
You can't afford the cost  
Don't try to expiate your father's sins  
  
Breakdown, breakdown  
Breakdown and cry  
Devil's daughter (I'm watching you watching you)  
Devil's daughter (I'm watching you watching you)  
Devil's daughter (I'm watching you watching you)  
Devil's daughter ha ha ha

Screaming at the window  
Watch me die another day  
Hopeless situation endless price I have to pay  
  
Sanity now it's beyond me there's no choice  
  
Diary of a madman  
Walk the line again today  
Entries of confusion  
Dear diary I'm here to stay  
  
Manic depression befriends me  
Hear his voice  
Sanity now it's beyond me  
There's no choice  
  
A sickened mind and spirit  
The mirror tells me lies  
Could I mistake myself for someone  
Who lives behind my eyes  
Will he escape my soul  
Or will he live in me  
Is he tryin' to get out or tryin' to enter me  
  
Voices in the darkness  
Scream away my mental health  
Can I ask a question  
To help me save me from myself  
  
Enemies fill up the pages  
Are they me  
Monday till Sunday in stages  
Set me free

You're saving the saved,  
Men and women enslaved,  
Propagating the messiah conception  
The rich getting richer,  
Paint you into the picture,  
Give the poor immaculate deception  
  
Where are you Father?  
Why don't you save us?  
The fallen are dying alone  
How can you shut off their cries?  
Ignore a new genocide?  
So come on, Jesus,  
We're all here waiting just for you  
  
How long must we keep on waiting?  
The faithful and blind are keepin' me, keepin' me down  
How long? Cause my faith is breaking,  
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down  
  
Do you live in the light  
Or in the dead of the night?  
Sanctimonious promises broken  
Hypocritical sin,  
Dying slowly within,  
Is the sacred truth forever unspoken?  
  
Life ever after,  
Bohemian rapture,  
Beware the dark side of the sun.  
You're just a self-made messiah,  
Selling brimstone and fire  
So come on, Jesus,  
Don't keep us waiting just for you  
  
How long must we keep on waiting?  
The faithful and blind are bringin' me, bringin' me down  
How long? Cause my faith is breaking,  
The pure and divine are diggin' me, diggin' me down  
  
How will I know you, Mr. Jesus Christ?  
Have you already been here once or twice?  
The son of man are obsolete facade,  
How will I know that you're the son of God?  
Yeah

Found out you're really something  
They talk about you,  
Then turn your confidence against you  
Now into nothing  
  
Grinning from the daze  
Petrified and blazed  
Feels good to know they care  
Special friends simply two faced  
  
You couldn't let go  
Your talking got you here,  
Tearing up everyone  
Respect, you don't know  
  
They say I'm jaded  
Cause they know it's true,  
With all those silly people  
On the wonder wheel  
  
Glizen from the daze  
Purified and crazed  
Feels good to hear them share  
Hateful friends simply two faced  
  
You couldn't let go  
Your talking got you here,  
Tearing up everyone  
Respect, you don't know  
  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live let go  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Let live  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste your fucking time  
Don't waste

Everybody knows all the highs and all the lows,  
And in that nothing ever goes right,  
It's not up to me if you look but you don't see,  
What could obviously be alright?  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere  
  
It's a vision,not religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
Nowhere you can hide,  
So don't blame me.  
  
There's no guarantee what you get is what you see,  
Don't try to find it,just don't try,  
Don't try living in the past,if you want your dreams to last,  
Don't hide behind the mask of lies,  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby,  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere  
  
It's a vision,not religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
So don't blame me [Repeat x4]  
  
Deep inside of me,lives a hunger to be free,  
I know I'll have to pay the prize,  
I may never know when it comes or when it goes,  
I guess it's just a part of life?  
  
Like goin' nowhere,like goin' nowhere baby,  
Nowhere baby, like goin' nowhere, like goin' nowhere,  
  
It's a vision,it's religion,  
And the truth is plain to see,  
It's a feeling,it's revealing,  
Nowhere you can hide,  
So don't blame me [Repeat x4]

You make promise of protection  
To a future after life  
To the final resurrection  
And to eternal paradise  
  
But then I'm blinded with temptation  
And to every mortal sin  
Is it God that sits there waiting?  
Or will the darkness suck me in  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
That I'm facing hell  
  
Oh the children sit and listen  
The belief was in their eyes  
In a land without tomorrows  
Through the night you hear their cries  
  
But then your eyes just skip the pages  
Of a book that never ends  
Is it God that sits there waiting?  
Do you hear the call again?  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
That I'm facing hell  
  
It's just crazy world we live in  
And I'm out of my mind  
You pray tomorrow but your leaving today  
Evil one is coming and he's knocking your door  
Cause today's the day you'll pay  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
  
Let's wake up the dead  
Oh yeah  
It's better that never you know  
More tears are shed  
Oh yeah  
I'm praying that you'll never know  
  
That I'm facing hell  
That I'm facing hell  
That I'm facing hell  
That I'm facing hell

Goin' home, late last night  
Suddenly I got a fright  
Yeah I looked thought the window and surprised what I saw  
Fairy boots were dancin' with a dwarf, all right now!  
  
Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
Yeah I saw it, I saw it, I tell you no lies  
Yeah Fairies wear boots and you gotta believe me  
I saw it, I saw it with my own two eyes, well all right now!  
  
So I went to the doctor, see what he could give me  
He said "Son, son, you've gone too far.  
'Cause smokin' and trippin' is all that you do."

No prayers left for heroes,  
The dead won't see the ending,  
War started by rich men  
Won't stop the poor from dying  
  
I'll grant you, your death wish,  
It's not just time I'm killing,  
Blood's thicker than water,  
It's too late to surrender  
  
This will be your last stand,  
I wash the blood from my hands  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I, I'm fearless  
  
I answer no questions,  
You will obey my order,  
I'll punish all sinners,  
This battle has no borders  
  
No saving salvation,  
Your soul is stained and rusted,  
I follow no leader,  
My vigilante justice  
  
I'd rather die on my feet  
Than live a life on my knees  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I, I'm fearless  
  
My skin and bones drip off of me,  
I'm more than man, more than machine  
  
This will be your last stand,  
I wash the blood from my hands  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I  
  
I am warrior,  
I'm fearless  
No pain,  
No mercy,  
No weakness,  
I, I, I'm fearless

The introduction to his heartache began as a child  
So it's no wonder that he grew up to be so wild.  
So he protected his feelings in walls he imagined  
But castles crumble exposing the frightened child.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.  
  
In solitude he couldn't deal with his own existence,  
The burning questions in the castles have still remained.  
God only knows how he searched in vain for the answers,  
Now castles crumble exposing his naked flames, yeah.  
  
Fire in the sky, can't you see that all my castles are burning.  
Fire in the sky, won't you help me now my castles are burning.

Got a crazy feeling I don't understand  
'Gotta get away from here  
Feelin' like I shoulda kept my feet on the ground  
Waitin' for the sun to appear  
  
Mamma's gonna worry  
I been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin' sorry  
It's somethin' that I enjoy  
  
'Cause you can't see what my eyes see  
(I can see it, I can see it)  
And you can't be inside of me, flying high again  
  
I can see through mountains watch me disappear  
I can even touch the sky  
Swallowing colors of the sound I hear  
Am I just a crazy guy (You bet)  
  
Mamma's gonna worry  
I been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin' sorry  
It's somethin' that I enjoy  
  
If you could be inside my head  
You'd see that black and white is read  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again come on and join me  
  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again come on and join me  
  
Daddy thinks I'm lazy he don't understand  
Never saw inside my head  
People think I'm crazy but I'm in demand  
Never heard a thing I said  
  
Mamma's gonna worry  
I've been a bad bad boy  
No use sayin' sorry  
It's somethin' I enjoy  
  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again  
Flying high again

I hear you breathing though  
You're so far away  
Can you just go where you're  
Going to  
I couldn't give a damn or two  
About a fool like you  
That's true  
Are you just too cool no  
You're just perfectly cold  
And what goes around still  
Comes around  
I think it's all summed up and  
Down in a fool like you  
That's true  
Today is just another day  
You hold your ticket into  
Nowhere  
It's up to you if you will stay  
And turn your day into a  
Nightmare  
  
You think you know it you think  
You know it all  
But you don't even have a clue  
And control is still in view for  
A fool like you  
That's true  
Is there a reason for the way  
That you are  
Or does it just come naturally  
To have an idiosyncrasy and be  
A fool like you  
That's true  
  
You're hearing what you want  
To hear  
Misunderstanding all you see  
An attitude in all of us  
Is it really you and me  
  
He's hiding residing deep within  
The crowd  
A hand out he'll pull you down  
  
You've been found guilty  
Committed every crime  
But still they say you must go  
Free  
Looks like haunted i will be by a fool like you  
Fool like you  
That's true  
  
By a fool like you by a fool like  
You  
Looks like haunted i will be by a  
Fool like you  
That's true  
By a fool like you by a fool like  
You  
Looks like you by a fool like  
You  
Looks like haunted i will be by a  
Fool like you  
That's true

There's something happening here  
What it is ain't exactly clear  
There's a man with a gun over there  
Telling me I got to beware  
  
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
Battle lines being drawn  
Nobody's right if everyone's wrong  
People speaking their minds  
Getting so much resistance from behind  
  
Yeah, stop children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
What a field-day for the heat  
Ten thousand people in the street  
Singing songs and carrying signs  
Mostly say, hooray for our side  
  
I think it's time we stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
Paranoia strikes deep  
Into your life it will creep  
It starts when you're always afraid  
Step out of line, the man come and take you away  
  
Stop, children, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
Stop, hey, what's that sound  
Everybody look what's going down  
  
You better stop!  
Stop  
You better stop!  
Stop  
You better stop!

There's no present there's no future  
I don't even know about the past  
It's all timeless and never ending  
To take it in it's all too vast  
It goes - forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tommorow  
Journey to the centre of eternity  
Journey to the centre of eternity  
The time is coming but also going  
And it's leaving never to return  
Maybe forever it could be heaven  
But if it's hell then you can watch me burn  
It goes - forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tommorow  
I got to travel forever  
It's all within my mind  
An endless path to endeavour  
But forever is A long long time  
There's no secrets and no corruption  
In the centre of infinity  
There's no limits in non-Existence  
And no begining to my destiny  
It goes - forever and ever  
You thought you knew but you never  
There goes  
Tommorow  
Journey to the centre of eternity  
Journey to the centre of eternity

I wish I was infinite and given my way  
I'd be so fucking cool  
When i'm feeling the rush  
I look at you through different eyes.  
I never knew my thoughts televise what you think  
I'm the twin inside you  
  
Its hard to believe what you say  
Uaccepting what you've tried to show us  
And nothing can fix what's incomplete  
Cant get to us never get to us  
  
Refreshing memories of times we've known  
Constantly stumbling over reason where do these words go  
Now so true covering no one esle but you  
Stepping up to freak the day  
Devour every modern day  
  
Fell awake in my dizziness  
I'm blinding  
I wish I was obedient  
Arent I something  
I'll never be rational  
I'm finding my way to everyone in this velvet sky of mine  
  
  
Boredom does nothing for me  
So why does it follow  
Walking with the deadbeats down the street  
I want everything  
  
I'll be your idol  
Be your maker  
Your everything  
Your dirty dream designer  
Be your everything

When I think of all the good times that I've wasted having good times  
When I think of all the good times that 's been wasted having good times  
  
When I was drinking  
I should've been thinking  
When I was fighting  
I could've done the right thing  
All of that boozing  
I was really losing  
Good times  
Good times  
  
When I think of all the good time that's been wasted having good times  
When I think of all the good time that we wasted having good times  
  
All of my lying  
I remember her crying  
All of the talking  
I could've been walking  
Instead of complaining  
I could've been gaining  
Good times  
  
Useless talking  
All that walking  
All of my sinning  
I could've been winning  
I have it too easy  
And its a beginning of a good time  
Good times  
  
When I was drinking  
I should've been thinking  
When I was fighting  
I could've done the right thing  
All of that boozing  
When I was really losing  
All of my sinning  
I could've been winning  
  
Oh yeah, I am ready for a good time  
  
Cheers!

Yeasterday has been and gone  
Tomorrow will I find the sun or will it rain  
Everybody's having fun except me I'm the lonely one  
I live in shame  
  
[Chorus]  
I say goodbye to romance  
Goodbye to friends  
Goodbye to all the past  
I guess we'll meet, we'll meet in the end  
  
I've been the king, I've been the clown  
Still broken wings can't hold me down  
I'm free again  
The jester with a broken crown  
It won't be me this time around to love in vain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I feel the time is right although I know  
That you just might say to me  
What ya gonna do  
What ya gonna do  
'Cause I have to take this chance  
Goodbye to friends and true romance  
And to all of you  
And to all of you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And the weather's lookin fine and I think the sun will shine again  
And I feel I've cleared my mind all the past is left behind again  
  
[Chorus]

I remember all the good times  
Sometimes I'd wonder would it last  
I used to dream about the future  
But now the future is the past  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
  
So now I sit here and I wonder  
Whatever happened to my friends  
Too many bought a one way ticket  
But I'll be with you till the end  
  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
  
You're my religion, you're my reason to live  
You are the heaven in my hell  
We've been together for a long, long time  
And I just can't live without you  
No matter what you do  
I'm here for you  
  
I don't wanna live in yesterday  
Cross my heart until I die  
Don't wanna know just what tomorrow may bring  
Because today has just begun  
No matter whatever else I've done  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you  
I'm here for you

I don't want to be a hero  
I don't ever want to let you down  
No I don't want to let you down  
  
I can try to take you higher  
But I don't want to wear your broken crown  
You know it brings me down  
  
Don't think you'll ever understand me  
I don't even understand me  
Don't have the power to anoint you  
And I don't want to disappoint the fools no more  
The fools no more  
  
I couldn't answer all your questions  
And if you're lost I couldn't find the way  
I couldn't find your way  
  
You know you'll have to face the music  
You change your tune, you don't know what to play  
So don't you run away  
  
Everybody's talking crazy  
So think I am a devil maybe  
I don't want to hear about it  
Don't want to have to scream and shout it  
  
Fools no more  
The fools no more  
  
So I don't want to be a hero  
Don't want to sit upon your crippled thrown  
I've got a life of my own  
  
I am not your destination  
Or a road that's gonna lead you home  
So baby please don't go  
  
Please don't go  
Please don't go  
Please don't go...

You think you're special  
You think you're cool  
You're so invincible  
You're nobody's fool  
  
Dead man walking  
Your ego's high  
No matter who you are  
We're all gonna die  
  
Your time is coming  
Your soul is burning  
Your future's fading  
I Can't Save You  
  
Your demon's waking  
Your will is breaking  
Your body's shaking  
I Can't Save You now, now, now, now...  
  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
  
The years are passing  
The time goes fast  
You're in denial  
With your head up your ass  
  
Can't take it with you  
Leave it behind  
So many ways to live  
There's one way to die  
  
Your god is calling  
Your tears are falling  
You're head's exploding  
I can't save you  
  
No use in trying  
You can't stop crying  
You feel like dying  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you now, now, now, now...  
(You've got to save yourself)  
I can't save you  
  
Tempted by your twisted mind  
You destroyed your self-control  
For fame and fortune you gave it all  
No one said you had to sell your soul  
  
[Solo]  
  
Your time is coming  
Your soul is burning  
Your future's fading  
I can't save you  
  
Your demon's waking  
Your will is breaking  
Your body's shaking  
I can't save you  
  
Your god is calling  
Your tears are falling  
Your head's exploding  
I can't save you  
  
No use in trying  
You can't stop crying  
You feel like dying  
I can't save you now

Cheese is good  
It makes me smile  
But then I watch it fade away  
And I cry  
And I want to die  
Because I like cheese  
But it's not there anymore  
And I realize  
That I like death  
But not as much as cheese  
  
Chorus: I like death, but not as much as cheese  
I like death, but cheese puts me at ease  
I like death, but cheese is better  
Oh oh oh oh yeah cheese cheese cheese  
  
I saw you yesterday  
I'm so misunderstood  
You don't believe that I like cheese  
As much as I say I do  
You think I like death better  
But your wrong  
Satan told me so  
Satan likes cheese  
We like cheese together  
Me and satan  
Eating cheese  
Feeding each other cheese in the moonlight  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
  
I'm not the kind of person you think I am  
I'm a very cheesey old man  
I like death, but cheese is better  
Oh yeah yeah yeah  
Cheese is the anti-christ  
But not as much as me  
Or satan  
Because he's more anti-christ than me  
And we like cheese  
  
(chorus repeats over and over again and slowly fades intil song ends)

You're coming down badly  
You're crippled inside  
A rat in your sewer  
You've no place to hide  
A gut wrenching fever  
Addicted to death  
You don't give a fuck  
If it means your last breath  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But you'll never admit  
You're the junkie  
There's no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror don't lie  
You're the junkie  
  
You crave for the needle to stick in your vein  
Can't for the poison to kill all the pain  
You buy your cheap ticket to take a short ride  
That beautiful flower is eating your mind  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But you'll never admit  
You're the junkie  
There's no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror don't lie  
You're the junkie  
  
Your name means nothing  
You don't know the score  
Body is aching you still crave for more  
Sometimes you wish that you'd never been born  
Tormenting came with a crown full of thorns  
  
You're chasing the dragon  
You're chasing the high  
A bird with one wing  
Who's still trying to fly  
You're all out of spirit  
A dead man alive  
A born again junkie  
You'll never survive  
  
You try so hard to quit  
But you'll never admit  
You're the junkie  
There's no reasoning why  
Cause the mirror don't lie  
You're the junkie  
  
Junkie  
Junkie  
Junkie  
Junkie

If none of us believe in war  
Then can you tell me what the weapon's for  
Listen to me everyone  
If the button is pushed  
There'll be nowhere to run  
  
Giants sleeping giants winning wars  
Within their dreams  
Till they wake when it's too late  
And in god's name blaspheme  
  
Killer of giants threatens us all  
Mountains of madness standing so tall  
Marches of protest not stopping the war  
Or the killer of giants  
The killer of giants  
  
Mother nature people state  
Your case without its worth  
Your seas run dry  
Your sleepless eyes are turning red alert  
  
Killer of giants threatens us all  
Mountains of madness standing so tall  
Rising so proudly it has nowhere to fall  
This killer of giants  
This killer of giants  
  
Killer of giants threatens us all  
Mountains of madness standing so tall  
Marches of protest not stopping the war  
Oh the killer of giants  
Oh the killer of giants  
Killer of giants  
Killer of giants  

I know you think you're all alone  
I haven't been there when you needed me  
I didn't deserve the love you gave  
But now I'm telling you "I'm here, if you need a friend"

But if we bend instead of break  
The choice for us is to make it together  
Lay your world on me  
  
I help you keep it all together  
It's better late than never  
Lay your world on me  
Lay your world on me  
Lay your world on me  
I can take the weight

I wonder who died today  
I feel so numb I might as well be dead  
  
I live on hope and legal dope  
Addicted to the system  
Is it real or does it just live within my head

I can't believe a single word they say  
  
Cry another tear  
'Cause the devil will not wait  
Living in fear  
Why do people love to hate

Condemned to violence  
Arrested by pain  
Inside the soul lies a man insane  
Conceived in anger  
Addicted to hate  
The mutant child of a twisted state  
  
Beware the contradiction  
Beneath the crimson void  
'Cause in the world of fiction  
My Jekyll doesn't hide  
  
A killer's smile with  
A psycho star dream  
Behind the mask things aren't what they seem  
Unholy soldier  
Disciple of sin  
What kind of mind are you living in  
  
You're preaching revolution  
Don't you mean genocide?  
Behind this resolution  
My Jekyll doesn't hide  
  
Waiting to die for the every first time  
All right, that's right  
Waiting to die for the every first time  
I don't give a damn, 'cause I think it's my time, my time  
  
The symbiosis  
Of murder and lies  
What do I see looking through your disguise?  
Fourth Reich dementia  
Subversion ideals  
God only knows what your secret conceals  
  
Who'll be the first offender?  
Who will be victimized?  
In your perverse agenda  
My Jekyll doesn't hide  

The light in the window is a crack in the sky  
A stairway to darkness in the blink of an eye  
A levee of tears to learn she'll never be coming back  
The man in the dark will bring another attack  
  
Your momma told you that you're not supposed to talk to strangers  
Look in the mirror tell me do you uthink your life's in danger here, yeah  
  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
  
Another day passes as the night closes in  
The red light goes on to say it's time to begin  
  
I see the man around the corner waiting, does he see me?  
I close my eyes and wait to hear the sound of someone screaming here  
  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
  
So now that it's over can't we just say goodbye?  
I'd like to move on and make the most of the night  
Maybe a kiss before I leave you this way  
Your lips are so cold I don't know what else to say  
  
I never wanted it to end this way my love my darling  
Believe me when I say to you in love I think I'm falling here  
  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears  
No more tears

[Bonus track]  
  
You must seduce me, the ties with fire  
My one addiction, your sweet desire  
Is living in a world of hate and dreams  
Standing at the end of time  
We had paradise, but that was lost  
Forever to mankind  
  
No place for angels, for you and me  
No place for angels, I'm lost in your reality,  
And life seems so unreal  
  
I feel the madness, the Jesus liar  
The one creation, obsessed by fire  
Well, living in a world of hate and dreams  
Standing at the end of time  
We had paradise but that was lost  
Forever to mankind  
  
No place for angels, for you and me  
No place for angels, I'm lost in your reality  
And life seems so unreal  
  
You may think that I'm just a crazy guy  
And I wear the madman masks  
Do I live my life in a fake disguise?  
Is my world non-fiction yeah

Overbearing woman makin' it so hard for me  
Now you've laid it down for all to see  
Can I ask a question, d'ya think you can take a blow  
This is why I always come and go.  
  
Now you see it, now you don't  
Careful of words that get caught in your throat  
Face the music, take it like a man  
Givin' it to me anyway you can  
  
Everybody's feeling everything you've got to feel  
I've got something that you can conceal  
  
Now you see it  
Now you don't  
Now you see it  
Now you don't  
  
Give me central heating hope that I can pay the bill  
  
Makin' me forget my fear of hell  
Must be luck in odd numbers now you face me  
Upside down  
I'm so far up I'm afraid to come back down

You know my style faggot, 'cause I'm always schemin'  
In jail, niggas holdin' a sink screamin'

Locking open doors again, I'm still afraid of you

Light to dark, then light again, I always thought I knew (come on)  
Young to old and young again, what's left for me to do? (straight up)  
Center of the universe, collecting me in time (come on)  
I'm falling down upon the earth, and singing truth in rhyme (come on)  
If I was a rolling stone, I'd roll until I'm through (come on)  
And if I was a garden I would bloom in black for you

There's no walls that you have to climb  
This is real, this is elementary dear  
Elementary, Watson, Elementary

You don't want this money till it's rich  
Buy my album, coded by Dirty, set you free  
Go against the grain, I got the p  
I know you don't recognize me now  
I dunked your tongue  
How many lightening bulbs do it take to light up a fuck mode?  
Brothers, people, you'd better get the fuck off of me  
We don't need it, it gets more ugly  
Fools tryin' to bust their ass  
Tryin' to get away from me when I said my real name  
I call myself in the niggas butthole  
All the same, all the same, all the same  
  
Ain't nowhere to run

Look into the future  
Look into my eyes and tell me everything's all right  
Tell me where we're going  
I'm so afraid 'cause I don't know what's going on with my life  
  
But it'll be all right tonight  
Will it be all right tonight?  
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?  
  
Sitting by the ocean  
Mapping out my plans of action, baby they include you  
I wish you'd send a message  
Maybe I'm just better off not knowing who knew  
  
But it'll be all right tonight  
I'm gonna be all right tonight  
Are we doin' all right in old L.A. tonight?  
  
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes  
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind  
And I'll never know why  
I'm falling to pieces, pieces  
  
Who could you imagine such a thing could happen to you?  
It's gonna be all right in old L.A.  
  
Those summer nights when I look in your eyes  
I'm falling to pieces, pieces out of my mind  
And I'll never know why

I just can't seem to get enough  
When I'm running good, you know,  
I don't slow down, even the times  
When I know I should go slow  
  
I know this won't ever be easy,  
I don't give up, so won't you get me  
  
Give me some more,

And when I'm six feet under,  
Will you still be there for me?

We'll never stop, so won't you get me

Give me some more,  
I want it one more time  
  
I never wanted to be more than who I am,  
I'm just a lucky son from an unlucky man,  
You'd get me more than anything I ever had  
  
Take away my faith,  
Take away my name,  
Give me one more, one more pain

Over the mountain take me across the sky  
Something in my vision, something deep inside  
Where did I wander, where d'ya think I wandered to  
I've seen life's magic astral plane I travel through  
  
[Chorus]  
I heard them tell me that this land of dreams was now  
I told them I had ridden shooting stars  
And I said I'd show them how  
  
Over and over always tried to get away  
Living in a daydream only place I had to stay  
Fever of a breakout burning in me miles wide  
People around me talking to the walls inside  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me  
You don't need a ticket to fly with me--I'm free  
  
Over and under in between the ups and downs  
Mind on a carpet magic ride goes round and round  
Over the mountain kissing silver inlaid clouds  
Watching my body disappear into the crowd  
  
Don't need no astrology it's inside of you and me  
You don't need a ticket to fly with me, I'm free

They feel they've raised her  
The new queen of evolution  
Her fate wont see to that  
Cause we're gonna know her later  
Grab that girl, get her home lets put her on restriction  
Last time we let her go she missed two days of school  
Lets get her back, get her back  
  
This feels like a real life fantasy  
It feels like you  
This feels like a real life fantasy  
It feels like you  
  
Relaxed in vermin life applause takes place of feeling bad  
So you tried it  
Recalling memories of charm school pantomine turned so bad  
Dainty socialite she changed her point of view  
Now she's bad can't hide it  
I think she really like all the things that she learned.  
  
Be a good girl like  
Your suppose to be  
Dominate your fears  
Be a good girl like  
Your suppose to be  
Dominate your fears  
Good girls you should be  
I think you better know  
  
This feels like a real life fantasy  
It feels like you  
This feels like a true fantasmasy  
It feels like you

Finished with my woman 'cause she couldn't help me with my mind  
People think I'm insane because I am frowning all the time  
All day long I think of things but nothing seems to satisfy  
Think I'll lose my mind if I don't find something to pacify  
Can you help me occupy my brain?  
Oh yeah  
I need someone to show me the things in life that I can't find  
I can't see the things that make true happiness, I must be blind  
Make a joke and I will sigh and you will laugh and I will cry  
Happiness I cannot feel and love to me is so unreal  
And so as you hear these words telling you now of my state  
I tell you to enjoy life I wish I could but it's too late

Into the night I've gotta go  
That's when the juices start to flow  
Everything will be alright  
  
I might be blind but I can see  
I got the power inside of me  
Everything will be alright  
  
I'm never gonna crack under a witch's spell  
Never put her chain's on me  
I'm never gonna break it  
No I'll never tell  
I know she'll never let me be  
  
Party, party with the animals  
Party, no dogs allowed  
Party, party with the animals  
Party, no dogs allowed no more  
  
I like it fast, I like it slow  
There's no direction I couldn't go  
Everything will be alright  
  
I like it loud, I like it mean  
I got the thunder in my machine  
Everything will be alright  
  
Dancing with disaster is a part of me  
I'm never gonna let it go  
Don't know what I'm after I'm deserting me  
The secret that I'll never know

On his way to dinner when it took him by surprise  
And with one pull of the trigger he would vanish overnight  
Dancing by the roadside, holding on for dear life  
The a gun from out of nowhere made a widow of his wife  
  
I don't mind, single file down the runway  
Feelin' fine, and I'll see you my friend  
Over and over again  
  
Who can we get on this case?  
We need Perry Mason  
Someone to put you in place  
Calling Perry Mason  
  
Riding painted horses, oh the kids the love it so  
You can see it on their faces, how they love the wind to blow  
Minding my own business like my mama always said  
But if I don't try to help'um they could wind up on the front page  
  
I don't mind, draw the line then draw me an arrow  
Feelin' fine, then I'll see you my friend  
Over and over again  
  
Who can we get on this case?  
We need Perry Mason  
Someone to put you in place  
Calling Perry Mason  
  
Wake me when it's over, tell me it's all right  
Just keep on talking baby, I've been doing this all night  
How much did you give me, tell me it'll be all right  
  
Who can we get on this case?  
We need Perry Mason  
Someone to put you in place  
Calling Perry Mason, again, again, again, again

Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah  
  
When I look up to the sky  
I see your eyes in a funny kind of yellow  
I rush to bed I soak my head  
I see your face underneath my pillow  
  
I wake next morning tossed and yawning  
I see your face come peeping through my window  
Oh no  
  
Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah  
  
Pictures of matchstick men and you  
Images of matchstick men and you  
All I ever see is them and... you  
  
Oh, Ah, Oh, Ah  
  
Windows echo your reflection  
When I look in their direction  
Gone  
Yeah they're gone  
  
When will this haunting stop  
Your face just won't leave me alone  
Oh no  
  
Pictures of matchstick men and you  
Images of matchstick men and you  
All I ever see is them and you  
  
Oh you're in the sky  
You're with this guy  
You make men cry, you lie  
  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
Pictures of matchstick men  
  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men  
I can see those matchstick men

You can't escape what makes you tragic you know  
Vicious cause you want to be leaving time possessed to please you  
What might have been was never the way you envisioned things  
So difficult to stop pretending  
What's this to you anyway  
  
Turn down the voluptuous  
Keeping close to me again  
Hold back your virtues  
You're fearless in motion  
  
You found your way so why keep asking me  
Nothing common suits you, you live again in solitary,  
Look away for now, beautiful alone,  
Now who decides to settle down  
Maybe nobody really cares  
What's this to you anyway  
  
Turn down the voluptuous  
Keeping close to me again  
Hold back your virtues  
You're fearless in motion  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
You're better off saying nothing,  
Wish for a happy ending  
You're better off saying nothing  
Repent so all's forgiven  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
  
Something dirty's got you dear  
Makes me want to be with you  
Somethings painful's with you dear  
Makes me want to be with you

The midnight hour approaches  
The killing chill takes over him  
His victims will not know  
When he appears  
  
The lust of death's possession  
Will over take his psycho mind  
He won't be happy  
Till he smells the fear  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
Addicted to the madness  
The taste of death that lives within  
He loves it when he  
Tastes their final breath  
  
Stalking gives him pleasure  
Killing is the final act  
He takes no pity  
With his lust for death  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
Playing in his twilight zone  
He knows that he's the best  
Tripping through the streets alone  
Till he finds his victim next  
  
Killing gives him pleasure  
Sleeping gives him pain  
The only time he's feeling good  
Is when he's killed and killed again  
  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
  
When he's killed again  
When he's killed again  
Watch out  
  
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)  
(He's the angel of death, angel of death)  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
Looking for a victim wherever he can  
  
(He's the angel of death)  
Psycho man, psycho man  
(Angel of death)  
He's the killer

Purple Haze all in my brain  
Lately things don't seem the same  
Acting funny but I don't know why  
Excuse me while i kiss the sky  
Purple haze all around  
Don't know if I'm coming up or down  
Am i happy or in misery  
What ever it is that girl put a spell on me  
Help me Help me  
Oh i don't know  
Purple haze all in my eyes  
Don't know if it's day or night  
You've got me blowin,blowin my mind  
Is it tomorrow or just the end of time  
Who knows?  
Help me  
Oh yeah  
Come on know  
Tell me  
Tell me

So what's with your kind  
You scavenge to find  
What makes you  
Sepreme in design  
Accuse you cause they had the fun  
So differently divine  
When my mind goes override  
Its so typical to capture anonyminty  
I choose the crowd to divide  
  
So you'll see I try  
(Jon) cannot ever displace  
You see I'm jaded at times  
(Jon) from nowhere leaving this place  
So you see me die  
(Jon) right in front of your face  
You see I'm jaded at times  
(Jon) from nowhere leaving this place  
  
They made us with a tool  
Then they taught us how to live  
We met the candyman  
He filled us with his contraband  
Then they scared us all away  
  
While your visiting your bubble of reality  
Salivating at the sound of the bells  
I'll be seducing you through your confession  
They've been the ones you've known forever  
Someones been lied to  
With all the rage caught us dismal  
At times we've known forever  
You've been denied of supervision  
Just a test tube life away  
How could you make believe that we've lived through circumsicion  
When it's right here next to me  
Friendships changed to time  
They'd never let us leave  
You took your time too late  
Missing what you've never had  
I'll be the only one who knows  
Just how we've been abused

I was looking back on my life  
And all the things I've done to me  
I'm still looking for the answers  
And I'm still searching for the key  
  
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me  
It just won't leave me alone  
I still find it all a mystery  
Could it be a dream?  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
  
Through all the happiness and sorrow  
I guess I'd do it all again  
Live for today and not tomorrow  
It's still the road that never ends  
  
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me  
It just won't leave me alone  
I still find it all a mystery  
Could it be a dream?  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
  
Ah ah, the road to nowhere's gonna pass me by  
Ah ah, I hope we never have to say goodbye  
I never want to live without you  
  
The wreckage of my past keeps haunting me  
It just won't leave me alone  
I still find it all a mystery  
Could it be a dream?  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
You got to, got to, got to lead to me  
The road to nowhere leads to me  
You got to, got to, got to lead to me  
You got to, got to, got to lead to me  
Ah, the road to nowhere

Spent the last year  
Rocky mountain way  
Couldn't get much higher  
Out to pasture  
I think it's safe to say  
Time to open fire  
And we don't need the ladies  
Crying 'cause the story's sad, oh yeah  
'cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Rocky mountain way, oh  
  
Well he's tellin' us this,  
He's tellin' us that,  
Changin' it everyday  
Say's it doesn't matter  
Bases are loaded and casey's at bat  
Playin' it play by play  
It's time to change the batter  
  
And we don't need the ladies  
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad  
'Cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Rocky mountain way  
  
And we don't need the ladies  
Crying 'cause the story's sad, so sad  
'Cause the rocky mountain way  
Is better than the way we had  
It's better than the way we had  
It's better than the way we had  
So much better  
So much better  
It's so much better  
It's so much better  
  
Rocky mountain way

Now I find peace of mind  
Finally found a way of thinking  
Tried the rest found the best  
Stormy day won't see me sinking  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't conceal it like I know I did before  
I got to tell you now the ship is ready  
Waiting on the shore  
  
Dare to look face the test on the eve  
When you set sailing  
What you've learned what you've earned  
Ship of joy will stop you failing  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wind is high so am I  
As the shore sinks in the distance  
Dreams unfold seek the gold  
Gold that's brighter than the sunlight  
Sail away see the day  
Dawning on a new horizon  
Gold's insight shining bright  
Brighter than the sun that's rising  
  
Three thousand sails on high are straining in the wind  
A raging sea below is this voyage coming to an end

Trapped in a lonely body I'm  
Losin' control  
Can't show my emotions and I'm  
Losing my soul  
Could it be that I'm obsessed  
With feeding my disease  
I couldn't make it know that  
Hidden things that no one  
Sees  
  
Yeah loser I'm a secret loser  
Loser I'm a secret loser  
  
Fighting a losing battle  
Pretending to win  
Repenting to holy unknowns  
Pretending to sin  
All i do is hide the wounds  
Where blood just  
Won't congeal  
Couldn't ever take my soul  
'Cause isn't there to steal  
  
Yeah loser I'm a secret loser  
Loser I'm a secret loser  
  
Though I'm the loser there is  
No winner  
There's nothing left to win  
The hidden reasons now in  
Deletion  
Are lost in sin  
So heed my warning the time is  
Dawning  
I'll tell you here's the twist  
The truth is lying  
Below the surface i don't exist  
  
Loser I'm a secret loser  
Loser I'm a secret loser  
  
Seeing is not believing it don't  
Mean a thing  
Although it appears to be that  
The loser is king  
I can understand that what  
You see you think is real  
But underneath the surface is  
A wound that cannot heal  
  
Yeah loser I'm a secret loser  
Loser I'm a secret loser  
Loser I'm a secret loser  
Loser I'm a secret loser  
Loser I'm a secret loser

Voices, a thousand, thousand voices  
Whispering, the time has passed for choices  
Golden days are passing over, yeah  
  
I can't seem to see you baby  
Although my eyes are open wide  
But I know I'll see you once more  
When I see you, I'll see you on the other side  
Yes, I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side  
  
Leaving, I hate to see you cry  
Grieving, I hate to say goodbye  
Dust and ash forever, yeah  
  
Though I know we must be parted  
As sure as stars are in the sky  
I'm gonna see when it comes to glory  
And I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side  
Yes I'll see you, I'll see you on the other side  
  
Never thought I'd feel like this  
Strange to be alone, yeah  
But we'll be together  
Carved in stone, carved in stone, carved in stone  
  
Hold me, hold me tight, I'm falling  
Far away. Distant voices calling  
I'm so cold. I need you darling, yeah  
  
I was down, but now I'm flying  
Straight across the great divide  
I know you're crying, but I'll stop you crying  
When I see you, I see you on the other side  
Yes. I'll see you. See you on the other side  
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side  
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah  
  
I'll see you. See you on the other side  
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side  
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah  
I wanna see you, yeah, yeah, yeah, see you on the other side  
God knows I'll see you, see you on the other side, yeah  
I'm gonna see you. See you on the other side

A psycho drive twisted in my head  
Silence broken,  
but there's nothing said  
I got a nightmare from a fantasy  
Will the voices ever set me free  
I can hear 'em,  
I can hear 'em,  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see 'em,  
I can see 'em  
I can see 'em  
Over and over again  
I saw it happening like deja-vu  
They tried to tell me,  
But they couldn't get through  
In my head I hear the voices scream  
I need someone to tell me what it means  
I can hear 'em,  
I can hear 'em,  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see 'em,  
I can see 'em  
I can see 'em  
Over and over again  
Whoa  
Who turned off the lights?  
Whoa  
A shadow in the night  
Whoa  
It wasn't meant to be  
I can't take this alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight  
Oh no I can't take it alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight  
Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass  
I wonder if tonight will be my last  
I need an angel who will rescue me  
To save me from my mental symphony  
I can hear 'em,  
I can hear 'em,  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see 'em,  
I can see 'em  
I can see 'em  
Over and over again  
Whoa  
Who turned off the lights?  
Whoa  
A shadow in the night.  
Whoa  
It wasn't meant to be  
I can't take this alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight  
Oh no I can't take it alone  
Don't leave me on my own tonight

I'll never bother keeping up with you  
Burning the candle at both at both ends it's true  
You know the writings on the wall why do you ride to take a fall  
  
Slow down your moving way to fast  
Slow down you know you'll never last  
Slow down your haste is making waste  
Slow down and join the human race  
  
I tried to tell you time and time again  
You know you'll have to pay the consequence  
Now your obsessed with such a pace  
But slow and steady wins the race  
  
Slow down your moving way to fast  
Slow down you know you'll never last  
Slow down your haste is making waste  
Slow down and join the human race  
  
You seem to run around and round in vain  
People are saying that you've gone insane  
Tell me just what you're running from  
One day you're here and the next you're gone  
  
Slow down you're moving way to fast  
Slow down you know you'll never last  
Slow down your haste is making waste  
Slow down and join the human race

What you get and what you see  
Things that don't come easily  
Feeling happy in my vein  
Iceciles within my brain  
  
Something blowing in my head  
Winter's ice, it soon will spread  
Death would freeze my very soul  
Makes me happy, makes me cold  
  
My eyes are blind but I can see  
The snowflakes glisten on the tree  
The sun no longer sets me free  
I feel there's no place freezing me  
  
Let the winter sun shine on  
Let me feel the frost of dawn  
Fill my dreams with flakes of snow  
Soon I'll feel the chilling glow  
  
Don't you think I know what I'm doing  
Don't tell me that it's doing me wrong  
You're the one who's really a loser  
This is where I feel I belong  
  
Crystal world with winter flowers  
Turns my day to frozen hours  
Lying snowblind in the sun  
Will my ice age ever come?

Time has come to say goodbye  
I know it's gonna make you cry  
But you belong to another my love  
And half a love that just isn't enough  
  
I am so tired  
And I just can't wait around for you  
I am so tried  
And I always thought we would see it through  
  
I've waited all this time for you  
Believed your promises were true  
I keep believing that you mean what you say  
You'll leave tomorrow - now tomorrow's today  
  
And I often sit and wonder why  
You're not with me tonight  
I stayed at home remaining true  
While you were out with you know who  
  
I am so tired  
And I just can't wait around for you  
I am so tried  
And I always thought we would see it through

Your cold words deafen  
And silence long forgotten  
The logic never reclaimed  
  
The anger rises  
Sometimes there's no surrender  
No white flag flies  
You won't like me when I'm angry  
  
Stop talking to me  
Just like I don't even bleed  
This cross is heavy when  
You're my soul sucker  
  
Get out of my face  
The past is running in place  
The silvers cut me as you  
Suck the soul right out of me  
  
Soul sucker  
  
You bite down deeper  
Your tongue can cut my heart out  
You've passed the point of return yeah  
  
The storm lightens  
Get ready for the whiplash  
Don't think, don't speak  
Don't, my patience turns to violence  
  
Stop talking to me  
Just like I don't even bleed  
This cross is heavy when  
You're my soul sucker  
  
Get out of my face  
The past is running in place  
The silvers cut me as you  
Suck the soul right out of me  
  
Soul sucker  
  
I'm just a solitary man who wants to live  
A quiet life before where I cease to exist  
I don't need resistance for the things I can't control  
Just turn away and let it go  
  
Stop talking to me  
Just like I don't even bleed  
This cross is heavy when  
You're my soul sucker  
  
Get out of my face  
The past is running in place  
The silvers cut me as you  
Suck the soul right out of me

Now I feel the time is right  
Love will flow like wine tonite  
Give your love and it will come to you  
If you feel that you and me  
Could escape and hold the key  
To a paradise that's true and free  
  
Chorus:  
Steal away, steal away  
Steal away--the night  
You gotta steal it  
C'mon baby  
  
Now I've met your honesty  
You are here and I am free  
Broken chains have fallen all around  
Point my finger at the fools  
Broken chains and broken rules  
Let it be rebellion rules tonite  
  
Chorus:  
Steal away, you gotta steal away  
Steal away--the night  
  
Solo  
  
Can it be a dream come true  
Now that I am here with you  
Tearful eyes of joy is something new  
Runaway with me tonight  
Dream the dream and light the light  
Happiness is what you give to me  
Oooooh yeah!!  
  
Chorus:  
Steal away, steal away  
You gotta steal away--the night  
(3 times)

Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows  
  
Evil thoughts and evil doings  
Cold, alone you hang in ruins  
Thought that you'd escape the reaper  
You can't escape the Master Keeper  
  
'Cause you feel like you're living a lie  
Such a shame who's to blame and you're wondering why  
Then you ask from your cask us there life after birth  
What you sow can mean Hell on this earth  
  
Now you live inside a bottle  
The reaper's traveling at full throttle  
It's catching you but you don't see  
The reaper is you and the reaper is me  
  
Breaking laws, knocking doors  
But there's no one at home  
Made your bed, rest your head  
But you lie there and moan  
Where to hide, Suicide is the only way out  
Don't you know what it's really about  
  
Wine is fine but whiskey's quicker  
Suicide is slow with liquor  
Take a bottle and drown your sorrows  
Then it floods away tomorrows

It's getting near dawn  
When lights close their tired eyes  
I'll soon be with you my love  
To give you my dawn surprise  
I'll be with you darling soon  
I'll be with you when the stars start falling  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love  
  
I'm with you my love,  
The light's shining through on you  
I'm with you my love  
It's the morning and just we two  
  
I'll be with you darling now  
I'll be with you till my seas are dried up  
  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love  
  
I'm with you my love,  
The light's shining through on you  
I'm with you my love  
It's morning and just we two  
  
I'll be with you darling now  
I'll be with you till my seas are dried up, dried up  
  
I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so long  
I've been waiting so long  
To be where I'm going  
In the sunshine of your love

Please allow me to introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
I've been around for a long, long time  
Stole many a man's soul and faith  
I was around when Jesus Christ  
Had his moment of doubt and pain  
Made damn sure that Pilate  
Washed his hands and sealed his fate  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
I stuck around St. Petersburg  
When I saw it was a time for a change  
Killed the Czar and his ministers  
Anastasia screamed in vain  
I rode a tank  
Held a general's rank  
When the blitzkrieg raged  
And the bodies stank  
Oh, pleased to meet you  
Hope you guess my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
I watched with glee while your kings and queens  
Fought for ten decades for the gods they made  
I shouted who killed the Kennedy?  
After all it was you and me  
Let me please introduce myself  
I'm a man of wealth and taste  
I laid traps for the troubadours  
Who get killed before they reached Bombay  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game, oh yeah  
Every cop is a criminal  
And all the sinners are saints  
Heads is tails just call me Lucifer  
I'm in need of some restraint  
So if you meet me have some courtesy  
Have some sympathy, and taste  
Use all your well-learned politesse  
Or I'll lay your soul to waste  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  
What's my name?  
What's my name?  
What's my name?  
I am Lucifer  
Alright you motherfuckers  
What's my name?  
What's my name?  
Come on baby, come on baby, come on baby, come on baby  
Pleased to meet you  
Hope you guessed my name, oh yeah  
But what's puzzling you  
Is the nature of my game  

Well she's a mean hard woman and she knows what she wants.  
She is my tattooed rock n roll dancer, I'm under her thumb  
And when she tells me come, ?oh hi? is the only way I can answer.  
  
They're gonna put me away, put me away, god damn them.  
  
Well I can hear her meaning like a dog that's in heat  
She never takes no for an answer, she's driving me mad,  
She makes it good to be bad, my little tattooed rock n roll dancer.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, god damn them.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, god soul's on fire.  
  
Tattooed dancer, dance for me bitch.  
  
I think I'm in grave danger, goin' over the top  
There is no question only an answer, she can't give me love  
I think I've fallen in lust with my tattooed rock n roll dancer.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, God damn them.  
  
They'll never put me away, put me away, God soul's on fire.  
  
They'll never put me away, God soul's on fire

Like moths to a flame  
Is man never gonna change  
Time's seen untold aggression  
And infliction of pain  
If that's the only thing that's  
Stopping war  
  
Then thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
  
Nuke ya nuke ya  
  
War is just another game  
Tailor made for the insane  
But make a threat of their  
Annihilation  
And nobody wants to play  
If that's the only thing that  
Keeps the peace  
  
Then thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
  
Nuke ya nuke ya  
  
Today was tomorrow  
Yesterday  
It's funny how the time can slip  
Away  
The face of the doomsday  
Clock  
Has launched a thousand wars  
As we near the final hour  
Time is the only foe we have  
  
When war is obsolete  
I'll thank god for the war's  
To end  
But any talk about hell  
Freezing over  
Is all said with tongue in cheek  
Until the day the war drums  
Beat no more  
  
Then thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
Thank god for the bomb  
  
Nuke ya nuke ya

All these tears I cry  
Don't you wonder why  
Is it all a dream  
Never what it seems  
  
Gets under my skin  
Should I let you in  
Don't you think it's bad  
To give me something that I never had  
  
Every word I say  
Everytime I pray  
Look into my eyes  
Distant voices cry  
  
Is there light in me  
Tell me what you see  
You are what I have  
Can't get something that I never had  
Can't get something that I never had  
  
Should I think about tomorrow ohh  
Should I live for just today  
Take the light that burns inside you  
  
Let it burn away  
Let it burn away  
Let it burn away  
  
Will I see the day  
Will I have to pay  
What's inside of me  
You will never see  
  
Won't you let me in  
Don't you let me see  
Do you think I'm bad  
'Cause I want something that I never had  
'Cause I want something that I never had  
  
Give me something that I never had  
Give me something that I never had

You ask me the time of day  
I tell you I don't know  
In darkness I'm light years away  
The voices come and go  
  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
  
Burning bridges in the rain  
The crying embryo  
I seem so bliss-fully insane  
But still the pain won't go  
  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
  
Sacred words the angles wait for me  
They'll set me free  
But I can't see the jokes on me  
  
Babies crying other peoples tears,  
And in thier eyes  
They have reflected wasted years  
  
You ask me who I really am  
I still say I don't know  
The doors have all been tightly slammed  
The poision seeds are sewn  
  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
Save me, all my life I've been a liar  
  
Dying angles falling from above  
I've had enough  
I can not laugh the jokes on me  
Shattered dreams you can not realize  
Won't sympathize  
It's in your eyes  
Why can't you see?  
Am I the liar?  
Tell me who's the liar

I leave my son the legacy of dangers  
The tragedy of synthesizing rhymes  
The genocide that comes from total strangers  
Apocalyptic dreams to kill mankind  
  
I see the mystery unwind  
My spirit's telling me  
  
The sky is dying  
And the whole world's falling down  
  
Don't buy your fate  
From media messiahs  
God gave you breath  
Don't blow it all away  
  
I see the misery unwind  
You must be stupid or be blind  
My spirit's telling me that  
  
The sky is crying  
Burning holes into the ground  
The sky is dying  
And the whole world's falling down  
  
What did you see or don't you know?  
You only reap the seeds you sow  
Oh no  
  
The sky is crying  
Burning holes into the ground  
Messiah's coming  
But will he hang around  
Cause the sky is dying  
And the whole world's falling down

Your thoughts are compromising  
Self - centered, patronized  
Your image supersedes your soul  
You find me mystifying  
Subhuman, so annoying  
You can't have me under control  
You think you live forever  
You don't find that profound  
You won't think, you're so clever  
When you hear thunder underground, all right now  
Your morbid fear of losing  
Destroys the lives you're using  
You only have one point of view  
The stigma of delusion  
Confirms your self illusion  
And after all this could be you  
When you hear thunder underground, here we go now  
Could it be that I have found my mind or have I gone insane?  
Roller coaster of the madness and there's only me to blame  
The ever faithful hand of doom will take the pain away  
I'll never know the answer to it all 'til my dying day  
Your bullshit culture licking  
Can't stop the deathwatch ticking  
You're only mortal after all  
Your appetite for power  
Subverts your every hour  
But every time the mighty fall

The time has come for you  
To make up your own mind (mind)  
Stop looking for the answers  
That you'll never find  
  
Save all your tears for when you  
Really need to cry  
Don't wish your life away  
Just spread your wings and fly  
  
Time waits for no one  
It's never what it seems  
Stop waiting for tomorrow  
Stop living in your dreams  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know it's wasting away  
We don't plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time  
  
Can't hide the clock  
When every line shows on your face (face),  
So take it slow  
You'll never win the human race  
  
Time waits for no one yeah  
Everything must change  
Stop running to the future  
Start living for today  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know it's wasting away  
We don't plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time  
  
Just live every moment of each day  
Cause death is the price we all must pay  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know it's wasting away  
We don't plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time  
  
This life fading away  
This life ticking like a time bomb  
Ready to blow your tortured mind  
I know it's wasting away  
We don't plan for when it goes wrong  
The time that we lose  
We will never find time

Have you read the message, the writing on the wall  
Could it be the answer, the answer to it all  
What's going down in heaven, I'm playing with your head  
Don't believe them when they tell you, you'd be better off dead  
  
Living in the thunder driving me insane  
Can I get a witness to take away the pain  
Walking on the water going nowhere fast  
Feeling like I'm walking with no shoes on broken glass  
You know it  
  
You don't have to leave me lights on  
I'm so used to being blind  
No more goodbyes or yesterdays  
So it's I'll see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow  
  
Welcome to the sideshow, I'll cut to the chase  
Yeah I can hear you thinking it's going all to waste  
I don't mean to offend you when I look you in the eyes  
What's all this commotion? It leaves me mystified  
  
Chasing all the rainbows falling from the sky  
I know your intentions are all a bunch of lies  
I'm running out of patience, falling off track  
You better start to worry, 'cause I may not make it back  
All right now  
  
You don't have to leave me the lights on  
I'm so used to being blind  
One good reason to blow me away  
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow, I'll see you tomorrow  
  
Can it wait 'til tomorrow?  
'Cause tomorrow never comes...  
  
Living in the big house, dying by the rail  
If I wanted your opinion I'd call you in hell  
Could that be the mailman knockin' on the door  
Or just another lightweight finally evening the score  
You know it  
  
You don't have to leave me the lights on  
Now I'm so used to being blind  
No more goodbyes or yesterdays  
So it's, I'll see you tomorrow  
No more good reasons to blow you away  
So it's I'll see you tomorrow  

Now I'm back on the street again  
It never rains unless it pours  
Try to get back on my feet again  
I hear the raging thunder as it roars  
  
[Chorus]  
Tonight tonight is it just a rhapsody  
Or am I right  
Tonight tonight is it all a mystery  
I just can't fight no more  
  
I hear the questions surface in my mind  
Of my mistakes that I have made  
Times and places I have left behind  
And am I ever going to make the grade  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As I beat my head against the wall  
Running round in circles in vain  
I'm feeling three feet tall  
You don't understand I'm fading away  
  
Don't want your pity or your sympathy  
It isn't gonna prove a thing to me  
Good intentions pave the way to hell  
Don't you worry when you hear me sing  
  
[Chorus]

What kind of person lives behind that face?  
Inside your midnight eyes I'm staring into space  
I don't understand  
What kind of man do you think I am?  
  
I'm falling out of control  
You took my body and you tore out my soul  
I don't understand  
I'm just a simple man I am  
I am  
  
I don't really give a damn  
You take me just the way I am  
And only I have the answer  
I'm not owned by Uncle Sam  
And you're still guessing who I am  
I'm your voodoo dancer  
Voodoo dancer  
  
Consider my feelings just one time  
I've done my sentence even though there was no crime  
I'm an innocent man  
I should have learned to walk before I ever ran  
I'm still running  
  
You never know the secrets that I have inside my head I'm clever  
My crystal ball it tells me all the things I wanna know forever  
Now I'm feeling the emptiness inside still concealing  
All the things I tried to hide forever  
I don't understand  
  
I don't really give a damn  
You take me just the way I am  
And I have the ultimate answer  
I'm not owned by any man  
And now you know just who I am  
Yes I'm your voodoo dancer  
  
Would you like to come and play in my fantasy?  
There'll be no one there baby, just you and me

Waiting for darkness  
Doesn't anybody see  
  
Deafened by silence  
Doesn't anybody hear.  
(I'm waiting darkness)  
Playing with fire  
But they're screaming  
When they're burned  
Out of the sunlight  
Hasn't anybody learned  
I know what they find  
Is in their mind  
Its what they want to see  
Spare me from the light  
Here comes the light  
And here I'll stay  
Waiting for darkness  
  
Promise me rebirth  
And then you tear me from the womb  
Give me my freedom  
And then you lock me in a tomb  
  
I'm waiting for darkness  
You gotta believe, you gotta believe its true  
I'm waiting for darkness  
I just can't concieve why darkness is overdue.  
  
Who knows the answers  
Is it friend or is it foe  
Don't ask me questions  
There are things you shouldn't know

Misty morning, clouds in the sky  
Without warning, the wizard walks by  
Casting his shadow, weaving his spell  
Funny clothes, tinkling bell  
Never talking  
Just keeps walking  
Spreading his magic  
Evil power disappears  
Demons worry when the wizard is near  
He turns tears into joy  
Everyone's happy when the wizard walks by  
Never talking  
Just keeps walking  
Spreading his magic  
Sun is shining, clouds have gone by  
All the people give a happy sigh  
He has passed by, giving his sign  
Left all the people feeling so fine  
Never talking  
Just keeps walking  
Spreading his magic  

Woman I can hardly express,  
My mixed emotions and my thoughtlessness,  
After all I'm forever in your debt,  
And woman I will try to express,  
My inner feelings and my thankfulness,  
For showing me the meaning of success,  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
  
Woman I know you understand  
The little child inside the man,  
Please remember my life is in your hands,  
And woman hold me close to your heart,  
However distant don't keep us apart,  
After all it is written in the stars,  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
Ooh well, well, do do do do do do  
  
Woman please let me explain,  
I never meant to cause you sorrow and pain,  
So let me tell you again and again and again,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever,  
I love you (yeah, yeah) now and forever

Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass  
Who could have known tonight would be your last  
Now I'm left with just your memory  
You won't be coming home tonight  
  
A wasted driver twisted in your path  
Your life was taken from you in a flash  
There ain't no reason, just insanity  
Without the answer how can I be free?  
  
I can see you, I can see you  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see it, I can see it  
I can see it over and over again  
  
I saw it happening like deja-vu  
I tried to tell you but I couldn't get through  
And now the victim, what a waste of life!  
I wish to God that you had seen the light  
  
I can see you, I can see you  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see it, I can see it  
I can see it over and over again  
  
Ohh, who turned off the lights?  
Ohh, a shadow in the night  
Ohh, it wasn't meant to be  
You won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
No no, you won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
  
Shattered dreams lay next to broken glass  
Who could have known tonight would be your last  
Now I'm left with just your memory  
I guess some things were never meant to be  
  
I can see you, I can see you  
Someone wake me when it's over  
I can see it, I can see it  
I can see it over and over again  
  
Ohh, who turned off the lights?  
Ohh, a shadow in the night  
Ohh, it wasn't meant to be  
You won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
No no, you won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
  
Ohh, who turned off the lights?  
Ohh, a shadow in the night  
Ohh, it wasn't meant to be  
You won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight  
No no, you won't be comin' home, you won't be comin' home tonight

As soon as your born they make you feel small,  
By giving you no time instead of it all,  
Till the pain is so big you feel nothing at all,  
A working class hero is something to be,  
  
They hurt you at home and they hit you at school,  
They hate you if you're clever and they despise a fool,  
Till you're so fucking crazy you can't follow their rules,  
A working class hero is something to be,  
  
When they've tortured and scared you for twenty odd years,  
Then they expect you to pick a career,  
When you can't really function you're so full of fear,  
A working class hero is something to be,  
  
Keep you doped with religion and sex and TV,  
And you think you're so clever and you're classless and free,  
But you're still fucking peasants as far as I can see,  
A working class hero is something to be,  
A working class hero is something to be.  
  
There's room at the top they are telling you still,  
But first you must learn how to smile as you kill,  
If you want to be like the fool on the hill,  
A working class hero is something to be.  
A working class hero is something to be.  
If you want to be a hero, well just follow me

How many times can you put me down  
Till in your heart you realize  
If you choose to criticize  
You choose your enemies  
  
Everything that I say and do  
In your eyes is always wrong  
Tell me where do I belong  
In a sick society  
  
You're no different to me  
You're no different  
No different to me  
  
Look at yourself instead o' looking at me  
With accusation in your eyes  
Do you want me crucified  
For my profanity  
  
Concealing your crimes behind a  
Grandeur of lies  
Tell me where do I begin  
If you think you're without sin  
The first to cast the stone  
  
Living my life in a way  
That I choose  
You say I should apologize  
Is that envy in your eyes  
Reflecting jealousy  
  
Tell me the truth and I'll admit  
To my guilt  
If you'll try to understand  
But is that blood that's on your hand  
From your democracy

I don't need no doctor  
But I need something to kill the pain  
Don't know what I'm after  
But the pressure driving me insane  
Searching for a different ride  
Had a funny feeling I can't hide  
Hey, hey, do the zombie stomp  
Why can't they just let me be  
Alone without the misery  
Hey, hey, do the zombie, zombie stomp  
Flirting with disaster  
Morning after killing me again  
Hiding from the laughter  
And the demons dancing round my brain  
Always dancing on thin ice  
I guess I'll have to pay the price  
Hey, hey, do the zombie stomp  
Thinking how it could have been  
If I had never let them in  
Hey, hey, do the zombie, zombie stomp  
Take me to the doctor  
'cause I feel it coming on again  
Don't know where I'm going  
'cause I guess I don't know where I've been  
Looking for a different ride  
Always dancing on thin ice  
Hey, hey, do the zombie stomp  
Thinking how it could have been  
If I had never let them in  
Hey, hey, do the zombie, zombie stomp
