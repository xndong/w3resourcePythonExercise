You think I'm cool  
But I am not  
You think that I am nonchalant  
You think I'm hard  
That I lay the part  
Don't be fooled  
You are my heart  
Oh Babe I'm just so tired of being on the run  
  
Babe when I can't feel your touch  
And we've lost another day  
Seems like a million miles away  
I wander in the dark  
Looking for somewhere to stay  
Seems like I'm a million miles away  
  
Without love what have we got  
All these things don't mean a lot  
Let's disregard the past and start  
A new fire  
From this old spark  
Let's take this love  
And make it hotter than the sun  
  
Babe when I can't feel your touch  
And we've lost another day  
Seems like a million miles away  
I wander in the dark  
Looking for somewhere to stay  
Seems like I'm a million miles away  
  
What am I looking for?  
What am I dreaming of?  
When you are the woman that I really love  
  
Babe when I can't feel your touch  
And we've lost another day  
Seems like a million miles away  
I wander in the dark  
Looking for somewhere to stay  
Seems like I'm a million miles away

I can see that look in your eyes  
You're in need of something you can't find  
You're tired of holding on to the pain  
You haven't got the strength to hold the reigns  
You are out of lane  
  
[Chorus]  
I know you can't take it  
I know you can't take it anymore  
I know you can't fake it  
I know you can't fake it anymore  
Now it's time for you to open a new door  
  
You fool yourself when you live a lie  
You spend all of your time getting high  
But drunken nights won't bury your fears  
All the drinks you had just turned to tears  
For too many years  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When you think that nobody cares  
Close your eyes and know that God is there  
And if you reach out He'll do the same  
Just ask for what you need in Jesus name  
Don't be ashamed  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it's time for you to open a new door

I been searching for you  
I heard a cry within my soul  
I never had a yearning quite like this before  
Now that you are walking right through my door  
  
All of my life  
Where have you been  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
And if that day comes  
I know we could win  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
  
A sacred gift of heaven  
For better worse, wherever  
And I would never let somebody break you down  
Until you cried, never  
  
All of my life  
Where have you been  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
And if that day comes  
I know we could win  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
  
At every time I've always known  
That you where there, upon your throne  
A lonely queen without her king  
I longed for you, my love forever  
  
All of my life  
Where have you been  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
And if that day comes  
I know we could win  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
  
All of my life  
Where have you been  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
And if that day comes  
I know we could win  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
  
All of my life  
Where have you been  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
And if that day comes  
I know we could win  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again  
I wonder if I'll ever see you again

(Bob Dylan )  
  
There must be some kind of way out of here  
Said the joker to the thief  
There's too much confusion  
I can't get no relief  
Business men they  
They drink my wine  
Plowmen dig my earth  
No one will ever on the mine  
Nobody of it is worth  
  
No reason to get excited  
The thief he kindly fool  
There are many here among us  
Who feel that life is but a joke  
But you and I we've been through that  
And this is not our fate  
So let us talk falsely now  
The hour's getting late  
Yeah  
  
All along the watchtower  
The princess kept the view  
While all the women came and went  
Bare feet servants too  
Outside in the cold distance  
A wild cat did growl  
Two riders were aproaching now  
And the wind began to howl  
  
Yeah  
All along the watchtower  
Yeah  
All along the watchtower  
Oh come on

Is it the way that you feel when i'm kissing on you  
Or is it the soul I can see in your eyes  
The clothes that you wear or the smell of your hair  
Or is it the way I can't sleep when you're not there  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
  
Is it the way that you feel deep inside  
Or is it the way that I feel so alive  
Your star and your flair are beyond compare  
Or is it the way that we feel when we're on fire  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, Oh I, I've been waiting for you  
Every night, Oh I've been waiting for you  
  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, Oh I, I've been waiting for you  
All my life, I've been waiting for you  
  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you  
I've been waiting for you

My mama said  
That your life is a gift  
And my mama said  
There's much weight you will lift  
And my mama said  
  
Leave those bad boys alone  
And my mama said  
Be home before the dawn  
And my mama said  
  
You can be rich or poor  
But my mama said  
You can be big or small  
  
But I'm always on the run  
  
My mama said  
That it's good to be fruitful  
But my mama said  
Don't take more than a mouthful  
  
And my mama said  
That it's good to be natural  
And my mama said  
That it's good to be factual  
  
But I'm always on the run  
  
My mama said  
Baby don't ride that crazy horse  
And my mama said  
You must push with much force  
  
And my mama said  
Go get all that you're after  
And my mama said  
That love's all that matters  
  
But I'm always on the run

Haven't you heard it could be coming tonight  
Just leave all your things and come and celebrate life  
This time is for love, not for heartache and strife  
There's no time for games and there's no time to fight  
  
Just feel all the love that is in the air,  
The feeling so good and it's everywhere,  
So come on along if you heart's feeling right,  
Just open your wings it's a natural flight  
  
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool,  
And I'll see you in another life  
See you in another life  
  
He walked on this earth so we can party tonight,  
He taught us of faith 'cause it's not about sight  
He taught us of peace and unconditional love  
He led us from wrong and forave us there of  
  
He did all the things 'cause he wanted you  
He died on that cross so you wouldn't have to,  
And now all the worlds such a beautiful light,  
Just open your eyes it's a beautiful sight  
  
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool,  
And I'll see you in another life  
Another life, come on !  
  
You can do what you want, you can say I'm a fool,  
And I'll see you in another life  
See you in another life, oh yeah  
Another life

See you in another life, oh yeah,  
Another life, see you in another life  
Take me higher higher, Oh yeah yeah  
  
Higher higher, higher yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah !  
Higher higher, Come on -(living? you sinners?) yeah  
Higher higher, higher yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Intro after 8  
  
I was born, long ago  
I am the chosen, I'm the one  
I have come, to save the day  
And I won't leave until I'm done  
  
So that's why, you've got to try  
You got to breath and have some fun  
Though I'm not paid, I play this game  
And I won't stop until I'm done  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
I don't know why, we always cry  
This we must leave and get undone  
We must engage, and rearrange  
And turn this planet back to one  
  
So tell me why, we got to die  
And kill each other one by one  
We've got to love, and rub-a-dub  
We've got to dance and be in love  
  
But what I really want to know is  
Are you gonna go my way?  
And I got to got to know  
  
Solo after solo on after nine with pause then  
  
Are you gonna go my way?  
'Cause baby I got to know "talk"  
Yeah

It ain't over till it's over  
  
Here we are still together  
We are one  
So much time wasted  
Playing games with love  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over  
  
How many times did we give up  
But we always worked things out  
And all my doubts and fear  
Kept me wondering if I'd always be in love  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many tears, I've cried  
So much pain inside  
But baby, it ain't over till it's over  
  
So many years we've tried  
To keep our love alive  
But baby it ain't over till it's over

Brothers and sisters,  
Everythings gonna be alright  
We gonna be together in the moonlight  
No more pain or strife or sorrow  
It's a brand new day  
You don't need no money  
'Cause everything's free  
  
Come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
  
Hey look at that smile  
On that pretty girl's face  
She got no positions,  
But she's poised and has grace  
It's an inner beauty thing baby,  
That shines and shines  
It ain't about your appearance  
But the soul, look inside  
  
So come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
  
Rise up, rise up  
Get up, get up  
Come on, come on  
  
Come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
Come with me baby,  
'Cause it's been such a long long time  
It's time for ascension  
To be free, to be wild  
To be wild, to be wild,  
To be free to be wide  
Free

Lord what's the matter  
Am I lost  
This life's a disaster, what is the cause  
Am I a junkie, what is my fate  
Or am I a flunkie who doesn't relate  
Or am I a child so full of hate  
  
Am I a doctor or even a priest  
Or am I a rapist who needs a release  
A psychotic prancer  
Times Square dancer  
The mind can see as long as you'll be  
For real with yourself  
And you'll forever be  
  
Lord what's the matter am I insane  
This life's an illusion that's all it remains  
Are you listening, are you boss  
Am I gonna make it up on that cross  
Believe in Your name and  
You'll forever be

Black girl so fine and bright  
Black girl you shine as the night  
Black girl you move me so right  
I just have to make you mine  
'Cause you make me lose my mind  
  
Black girl with beauty so deep  
Black girl just rock me to sleep  
Black girl good things you will reap  
'Cause you're of the ancient vine  
And you're from another time  
And your history's all in line  
  
Ain't it funny how I used to wonder  
How could such a lovely girl give me love  
Oh oh oh oh oh yeah yeah  
  
Black girl, your ancestry's long  
Black girl, you're where you belong  
Black girls, have got to be strong  
Got to keep your spirits high  
Got to keep yourselves alive  
You're just gonna make it fine  
  
Listen baby you're the jewel of my eye  
Come on girl  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Listen baby  
I just got to make you mine

I know a girl who gets off  
By sticking needles in her vein  
Oh Lord what a shame  
She's got no money so she turns tricks  
  
And plays dirty games  
Oh Lord spare her pain  
What she says she do to you  
You'd have to be insane  
  
The bathroom stall, her bedroom  
The one that's always engaged  
She sleeps and eats with the plague  
She's got a baby in her belly  
  
But she just don't care  
What will be come of the pair  
Oh Lord what can she do  
To get the shit out of her hair  
  
To get the shit out of her hair  
Blues for sister someone  
Oh Lord

Living in lies by the railway line  
Pushing the hair from my eyes  
Elvis is english and climbs the hills  
Can't tell the bullshit from the lies  
Screaming along in south london  
Vicious but ready to learn  
Sometimes I fear that the whole world is queer  
Sometimes but always in vain  
  
So I'll wait until we're sane  
Wait until we're blessed and all the same  
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give  
Englishman going insane  
Down on my knees in suburbia  
Down on myself in every way  
  
With great expectations I change all my clothes  
Mustn't grumble at silver and gold  
Screaming above central london  
Never bored, so I'll never get old  
  
So I'll wait until we're sane  
Wait until we're blessed and all the same  
Full of blood, loving life and all it's got to give  
Englishman going insane  
Down on my knees in suburbia  
Down on myself in every way

Call yourself a family man  
Talking 'bout the families plan  
To bring the sweet talk deep and down  
Works better than an average pick up line  
You put your woman out to pasture  
On the promises you gave her last year  
Peace and love is on your head  
And the grass is greener playing 'round  
Your family seed is what you spread  
Chorus:  
Buddy my friend  
Who you think you fooling  
Buddy my friend  
And what about your woman  
Buddy my friend  
Who you think you fooling  
Buddy my friend  
  
I don't care what you do  
But there's a hypocrite that lives in you  
Cause if your woman gave her love  
In the same way that you do  
You'd feel a-way  
You know you would  
  
Chorus  
  
Buddy my friend  
Treat her that way  
And you'll be X-D soon  
Buddy X-D soon

You are the most beautiful thing  
I've ever seen  
You shine just like sunlight rays  
On a winter snow  
I just had to tell you so  
  
Your eyes sparkle as the stars  
Like the moon they glow  
Your smile could light the world on fire  
Or did you know ?  
  
Your mind's full of everything  
That I want to know  
I just had to let you know  
I just had to tell you so  
You're my butterfly  
Fly high  
Fly fly fly

Temperature's rising  
Fever is high  
Can't see no future  
Can't see no sky  
  
My feet are so heavy  
So is my head  
I wish I was a baby  
I wish I was dead  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
  
My body is aching  
Goose-pimple bone  
Can't see no body  
Leave me alone  
  
My eyes are wide open  
Can't get to sleep  
One thing I'm sure of  
I'm in at the deep freeze  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
  
Thirty-six hours  
Rolling in pain  
Praying to someone  
Free me again  
  
Oh I'll be a good boy  
Please make me well  
I promise you anything  
Get me out of this hell  
  
Cold turkey has got me on the run  
Cold turkey  
Cold turkey  
Got me on the run  
Cold turkey

Sometimes I think I've lost my mind  
I thought I left my past behind  
I live my life and all I know is  
Follow your dream and don't let go  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
It's my destiny  
  
There is no right, there is no wrong  
There is no place where I belong  
  
I've done my time  
I've held it strong and  
My life is all about this song  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
It's my destiny  
  
If I threw them all away would it change?  
No  
I would live my life again, rearranged  
There's a magic in my heart  
That I feel  
Don't you know that god is love  
And it's real  
  
No one can live for me  
No one can see the things I see  
I walk this road  
No one can tell me how to be  
It's my destiny  
  
My destiny  
My destiny  
My destiny  
It's my destiny

Its time to face it come on in

And your dirty white boots, come on  
You know you turn me on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
  
We're gonna get it on  
In your dirty white boots, come on  
Come on, come on  
Yeah!

Yeah  
(Thank you Jesus for the song)  
Hey Hey hey hey...  
Don't do it don't do it  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
  
I'm gonna get it  
But workin' nine to five just doesn't let it  
I feel I'm wastin' time and I regret it  
Can't even feed my kids and my wife  
  
Oh I'm longing to find it  
A taste of the sweeter life oh my  
Only takes a little time  
(No don't do it)  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
  
Oh my oh my  
Ain't got no credit  
Can't even pay my rent  
Where will I get it ?  
  
There's a liquor store right down the block I'll get it  
Can't even feed the pain in my heart  
Oh I'm longing to find  
( I'm longing to find )  
  
A piece of the bigger pie, oh my  
( A different kind )  
Only it takes a little time  
( A little time )  
(No don't do it)  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
  
Oh my oh my oh my ...  
  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Put a bullet in your head, oh my  
  
Oh my, put a bullet in your head, oh my  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Just turn your life around instead  
Don't go and put a bullet in your head  
Oh my, oh my oh my.

I smell the fear that rains inside  
The thought of children who must oblige  
To tainted dreams and polluted seas  
The missing moon and melting trees  
  
A mist of doom and clouds of pain  
Toxic waste and acid rain  
The passing of our ignorance  
A lifetime spent in abstinence  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
  
Conditioning to hate and them to blame  
Their search for God is just the same  
Machines for hearts, how warped a view  
Forgetting that they're human too  
  
Waiting like a branded steer  
Who first will launch the burning spear  
When every day may be your last  
You think we'd learn from our past  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
  
I smell the fear that rains inside  
The thought of so many lives denied  
More wounded soldiers, another burning flag  
And rows and rows of body bags  
  
No time for tears as the night falls cold  
The days survivors crawl back in their holes  
As for the rest they're shipped back home  
Home to the rows of white tomb stones  
  
Living in fear  
Living in fear  
I can't tell you no lies  
Living in fear  
Living in fear

Let's wander slowly through the fields  
Slowly slowly through the fields  
I touch the leaves that touch the sky  
Just you and I through fields of joy  
  
All trouble slowly fades away  
Slowly slowly fades away  
I hold your hand inside my hand  
Across the land through fields of joy  
  
The sound of music that we hear  
The blend of colors in the air  
All cities, mountains disappear from view  
All truth and beauty near to me and you  
  
With you through the fields  
With you through the fields  
With you through the fields  
The fields of joy  
  
Let's wander slowly through the fields  
Slowly slowly through the fields  
I know our love will never die  
Just you and I  
Through fields of joy  
Through fields of joy

The opportunity's takin' me over  
I'm gonna put on a mask  
I've got to be outrageous for my fans  
I am not gonna waste this moment  
Because these moments don't last  
So tonight I will shake it and show my ass  
  
Flash  
makes me feel good  
Feel like a queen  
And it gives me all the panache  
That I want  
That I need  
And it'll all be over in a flash  
  
Roll out the carpet give me some exposure  
'Cause soon I'll be the past  
But anyway I came here to tell you 'bout my plans  
Well  
Let's keep this moving while people still notice  
'Cause my time's going fast  
And when it's over, it's over  
'Cause I've got no class  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
  
Flash  
makes me feel good  
Feel like a queen  
And it gives me all the panache  
That I want  
That I need  
And it'll all be over in a flash

Dressed in purple velvets  
With a flower in her hair  
Feel her gentle spirit  
As the champa fills the air  
  
She wears rubys on her fingers  
Tiny bells upon her toes  
She's the finest thing  
I've ever seen  
Love that ring inside her nose  
  
Flower Child yeah  
Flower Child yeah  
  
She's a psychedelic princess  
On a magic carpet ride  
And where her trip will carry you  
Is somewhere you can't find  
  
She's on a plane of higher consciousness  
Meditation is the key  
She's got her shit together  
'Cause her soul and mind are free  
  
Flower Child yeah  
Flower Child yeah  
  
She's a child of Martin Luther  
As a freedom fighter she  
Speaks of liberation on the land  
And on the sea  
Her eyes are made of sunshine  
And her lips are jelly sweet  
  
Flower Child yeah  
Flower Child yeah

I want to fall in love again  
For the first time  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
I want to press your lips on mine  
  
For the first time  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
Love is something  
You can't get in a five and dime  
  
And love is the question of more time  
And love is something  
That's really hard to find  
Love makes a strong man  
  
Get down on his knees in the crowd  
Just lay your hand  
On mine  
Yeah, for the first time  
  
Makes me kind of wonder if you're still mine  
And I wonder If you'll ever really be mine

You can see it in a clear blue sky  
You can see it in a woman's eyes  
You can hear it in your baby's cries  
You can hear it in your lover's sighs  
You can touch it in a grain of sand  
Yeah hold it right there  
In the palm of your hand  
Feel it 'round you everyday  
And hear what I've got to say  
  
God gave me everything I want  
Come on  
I'll give it all to you  
God gave me everything I want  
Come on  
I'll give it all to you  
  
saw it in the midnight sun  
And I feel it in the race I won  
And I hear it in the windy storm  
And I feel it in the icy dawn  
And I smell it the wine I taste  
And I see it in my father's face  
And I hear it in a symphony  
And I feel it in the love  
You show for me  
  
Yeah  
God gave me everything I want  
Oh come on  
I'll give it all to you  
God gave me everything I want  
  
Come on  
I'll give it all to you  
God gave me everything I want  
I can't stop can't stop  
I'm still looking now  
God gave me everything I want  
Oh come on  
I'll give it all to you  
  
Crazy you said  
It's all in your head  
  
Chorus

God is love  
Through all your trials and tribulations  
God is love  
He'll get you through all situations  
  
God is love  
And if you are ready He always is ready for you  
  
God loves everyone  
That's why He gave His son oh yeah  
And you should feel His pain  
Yet He gave us everything  
  
God is love  
He'll get you through your pain and sorrow  
God is love  
He's coming back maybe tomorrow  
  
God is love  
And if you are ready He's gonna be ready for you  
  
God loves everyone  
That's why He gave His Son, oh yeah  
And you should feel His pain  
Yet He gave us everything  
  
And though much time has passed  
His words and promises always last  
And I am here to say  
That He loves each one of us in every way  
  
God is love  
He makes the rain that makes the flowers  
God is love  
And so amazing are His powers  
God is love  
And if you are ready He's gonna be ready for you  
  
God loves everyone  
That's why He gave His son, oh yeah  
And you should feel His pain  
Yet He gave us everything [Repeat: x 3]

We need a leader  
We can't seem to help ourselves  
Fighting and lying  
We can't seem to let it go  
We live each day  
On a small piece of borrowed time  
Why aren't we trying  
To enjoy this crazy ride  
What are we gonna do about it ?  
  
God save us all  
God save us all  
God save us all  
If we really try  
Maybe we can make it  
  
We need a teacher  
We must learn to see the light  
Let's get together  
This world needs us to do right  
There's too much poverty, sickness  
There's pain and strife  
Why aren't we trying  
To improve this thing called life  
What are we gonna do about it ?  
  
God save us all  
God save us all  
God save us all  
If we really try  
Maybe we can make it

Good morning  
Nice to see you  
How you've been  
The beginning of another lovely day  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Good morning  
  
Get up put your feet on the ground  
Wake up to an ice cold shower  
The coffee's hot but the cream is sour  
  
So get up  
  
Top of the morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Hey  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Can I walk you to the train  
Would you like to get a bagel on the way  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Good morning  
Get on and we go downtown  
Get off and go in the tower  
The boss is old but he has the power  
  
So we're up  
Top of the morning to you  
Good morning to you  
Hey  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
It's another day in the world in which we live  
  
I've got to find a way  
To get past what I can't forgive  
And no matter what we've got to try to move along  
So sing a song  
You can't go wrong  
Good morning  
Nice to see you  
How you been  
The beginning of another, lovely day  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
Good morning

I know where I shouldn't be  
You take my heart and drink it for tea  
You mix me up and walk out the door  
You take my love and hutr me for more  
  
But I gotta have it  
Watch out for the damage  
From New York straight to Paris  
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz  
  
Whenever he is around  
He puts me six feet under the ground  
And when you call he can never be found  
'Cause he is always out on the town  
  
But I gotta have it  
Watch out for the damage  
From New York straight to Paris  
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz  
  
He's so funky and he's looking good  
And he does it like a good man should  
And I would love him if only I could  
But his heart is like a piece of wood  
  
But I gotta have it  
Watch out for the damage  
From New York straight to Paris  
I'm talking Lenny Kravitz

Have you ever been  
Have you ever been  
To Electric Ladyland?  
The magic carpet waits  
For you  
So don't be late  
I wanna show you  
The different emotions  
I wanna run to  
The sounds and motions, heeey  
Electric woman waits for you and me  
So it's time we take a ride  
We can cast all of your hang-ups over the seaside  
While we fly right over the love filled sea  
Look up ahead

Soon you'll understand.  
Make love, make love, make love, make love.

There comes a time  
To be free of the heart  
I want to be ready  
Ready to start  
  
On a love journey  
Got places to go  
Made up my mind  
And I have got to let you know  
  
Heaven help the heart  
That lets me inside  
Heaven help the one  
Who comes in my life  
  
Heaven help the fool  
That breaks through my door  
'Cause I decided right now  
I'm ready for love  
  
A funny feeling's coming  
Over me  
Now I'm inspired and open to being  
In a love place  
  
But it's out of my hands  
I'm telling you baby that you got to understand  
  
Heaven help the heart  
That lets me inside  
Heaven help the one  
Who comes in my life  
  
Heaven help the fool  
That breaks though my door  
'Cause I decided right now  
I'm ready for love  
Ready for love  
  
I can't see what's out there for me  
And I know love offers no guarantee  
I'll take a chance and I'm  
Telling you something babe  
I got to let you know  
  
Heaven help the heart  
That lets me inside  
Heaven help the one  
Who comes in my life  
  
Heaven help the fool  
That breaks through my door  
'Cause I decided right now  
I'm ready for love  
  
Ready for love  
Take a chance  
Take the chance on love  
The heart, the fool

Your unconditional love  
Takes me to paradise

And you

Before you I was blind  
  
But since I've opened my eyes  
And with you there's no disguise  
So I could open up my mind  
  
I always loved you from the start  
But I could not figure out  
That I had to do it everyday  
  
So I put away the fight  
Now I'm gonna live my life  
Giving you the most in every way  
  
I belong to you  
And you

In this garden  
This lovely garden  
I build a temple of love  
Walk with the Father  
Won't be a bother  
To touch the Earth as it was  
  
We'll farm the land each day  
And in the sunshine we will play  
Glory glory for the day He came  
Our tears had gone away  
  
We'll make love in the shade  
And in the ocean we will bathe  
Little fishies in the sea  
Say hooray  
  
I build this garden for us  
  
In this garden  
Our children will grow  
Darling this is a must  
We'll be so happy  
Our little family  
So full of love and trust  
  
And darling when we're old  
We'll close the gates and lock the door  
Our love will never fade away  
When it's pure it's forever last  
  
And darling when you're cold  
I'll hold you tight and keep you warm  
Little darlin' gonna make it through the storm  
You'll never be alone  
  
I build this garden for us  
  
In this garden  
They'll be no war  
No racial prejudice  
You'll be my brother  
  
Of any color  
You'll just be okay with us  
We'll love each day in peace  
In hope that we will one day reach  
  
The rest of the world  
When they are ready to be taught  
The kingdom will come  
Thy will be done  
On Earth as it is in heaven  
  
I build this garden  
I build this garden for us  
  
I build this garden for us

Sometimes I don't feel alive  
Why do I keep running from the truth?  
I can see it in my eyes  
Where's the happiness that I once knew?  
  
I'm so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I can't escape the way I feel about you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I keep my head to the sky  
Waiting for the day that you'll come through  
I am free within my mind  
'Cause I know that it is coming soon  
  
I'm so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I can't escape the way I feel about you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I'm so tired of this place  
I wanna hear your voice  
I wanna see your face  
I can't escape the way I feel about you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I don't wanna know another day without you  
Won't you call my name  
'Cause I can't be without you  
  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know  
I don't wanna know another day with you, ah

I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
My friends wonder what is wrong with me  
'Cause I don't get off on my fame  
I got so much confusion now  
Sometimes I don't even kno my name  
  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
Too many distractions run through my brain  
So many girls they start to look the same  
Too many options no time to choose  
Too many clothes, too many shoes  
  
I've had the world I've done it upside down  
I played the part and I've been the clown  
Now it's my time, it's a brand new day  
To be myself in a different way  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
I got to meet all the wonderful people  
I drank with Dylan boy did we act a fool  
I got to meet all the fabulous people  
I got high with Jagger, it was really cool  
  
I don't want to be a star  
Just want my chevy and an old guitar  
I don't want to be a star  
I don't need the fat cigar  
  
Never.

[Verse 1]  
The clouds are forming  
She comes again  
I'll go and walk with her  
Along the Seine  
Soon she'll be storming  
Here comes the wind  
But that don't bother me  
'Cause she's my friend  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
  
[Verse 2]  
I've held our memories  
All of these years  
So many good times  
And many tears  
I share my dreams with her  
I share my fears  
So I just walk with her until she veers  
Off in the distance  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
  
[Verse 3]  
Oh  
Just as she always does  
She has to leave  
With her she takes my heart  
Into her breeze  
Sometimes I think that she  
Just likes to tease  
Still I'll be waiting  
For her reprise  
  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love the rain  
I love  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
Oh yeah  
I love  
I love  
I love  
I love the rain  
Oh yeah

I got to let it, got to let it, got to let it go  
I got to live so I can enjoy the show  
The only element that's in the way is me  
So love it if you feel it and let it be, let it be  
  
Yeah!  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
No time to stay  
Life is moving much too fast  
Before we know it what we're doin'  
That will be the past  
And if we only knew how much time left we got to live  
We'd stop right, turn around  
And start again, start again  
Start again, start again  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
We got to live this last moment, baby  
Let's take it to the top  
This is our moment  
And has been right here before  
Come on and join me on a trip  
We'll explore this  
  
So come on baby  
Let's be on our way  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer  
  
I can feel it in my bones  
I'm a believer  
But I think I'll do my thing  
I'm a believer

When my memory starts to wander  
I sit back and I ponder  
How the whole world's gone asunder  
I feel the rain and I hear the thunder

Into a world I plunge thru my headphones  
Escape into the streetlight  
I begin to believe in destiny  
When my surroundings in rhythm with me  
I'm just a grain of sand walking in a sea of people  
I look around me and my name is just someone  
For a moment in time I belong  
Where my heart beats the fear is gone  
Like destiny  
  
So move with me I'm strong enough  
To be weak in your arms  
Move with me I'm strong enough  
To be real in your arms  
  
Whispering as I was driving  
Quietly the car was rolling  
Like a bullet  
I was feeling the speed moving  
Me faster. Addicted to the rhythm  
On my ghetto blaster  
That's me supposing  
That the clarity of thought  
Is clear enough to think  
It's real enough to touch  
The wind on me got me tripping  
Can I keep you next to me  
Till the end of the world  
  
Like the joker on the pile  
Never coming or going  
The colour of my true cards was showing  
Keeping in touch with an idea  
That I been growing  
Trust trust I must trust  
With my head on my chest  
I rest with the rest of the restless

Waiting impatiently for you to come  
Wondering if you will always be the one  
Is this good for you  
Is it wonderful for you too  
  
'Cause baby I told you I'm ready for love  
I'm anticipating and waiting for some

And we'll be together just you and me dear

You can have it if you really want  
You can grasp it if you have the thought  
Feel your power that is deep within  
Are you ready ?  
  
On your mark begin  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
  
Do you feel your life's a big mistake ?  
Don't you hate the way it's all so fake ?  
All I want to do is just be real  
And get off of the spinning wheel  
  
All they sell us is a pack of lies  
And we're buying one in every size  
Can't you see it in the children's eyes ?  
It's about to get wild  
  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
Ha yeah  
  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
We should take time out to really love  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
Any you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
  
Hey hey  
We should take time out to really love  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
  
Any you want it  
You can have it any way you want it  
Hey hey  
We should take time out to really love  
  
We should find out who we really are  
You can have it any way you want it  
You can have it any way you want it

I'm just a human  
I never said I was god  
And each day I wonder where you are  
How could our lives once be so together  
Now we're apart  
I know we can make it  
But where do we start?  
Sometimes the scales get unbalanced  
Don't you know the reason why?  
  
The difference is why  
The difference is why  
  
You say you can't trust me  
Have you tried?  
You say you don't love me  
That's a lie  
There are so many so many rainbows  
That we were to climb  
But baby baby why can't we survive?  
We've got to get our heads untangled  
And free our state of mind  
  
The difference is why  
The difference is why  
  
Sometimes the scales get unbalanced  
Don't you know the reason why?  
  
The difference is why  
The difference is why  
Does this have to mean goodbye?

Life brings on unexpected changes  
But we must carry on despite it  
Are we gonna try  
Are we gonna make it  
Why is love so very hard  
Why is peace so very far  
I can't make it  
  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna wither and die  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna say goodbye  
  
We can't control all our situations  
And we can't console underpriviledged  
Nations  
So why don't we try  
To make more smiling faces  
We're so full of disregards  
We feel pain within our hearts  
I can't take it  
  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna wither and die  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna say goodbye  
  
So I'm calling out  
Out to all he races  
We can't gain control  
Without communication  
And we need to learn for future generations  
There is a future in our stars  
There is beauty that is ours  
We're gonna make it  
  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna wither and die  
The future of our space and time  
Is not gonna say goodbye

What's been goin' on  
I've been tryin' to get through to you  
Has it really been that long?  
I've been thinkin' about you baby  
And the way it used to be  
There's so many things I want to say  
But will the words come out all wrong?  
After all that's said and done  
You're still the only one  
  
You're the only one for me  
I'm the only one for you  
Baby can't you see  
You're still the only one  
Each and every night I pray  
Hopin' there'll come a day  
Baby you believe  
You're still the only one  
  
Got to find a way  
To get back inside your heart again  
If I let you walk away  
I'd be dyin' without you baby  
So I just keep holdin' on  
Don't you know we were meant to be  
But then I knew it all along  
After all that we've been through  
You're still the only one  
  
You're the only one for me  
I'm the only one for you  
Baby can't you see  
You're still the only one  
Each and every night I pray  
Hopin' there'll come a day  
Baby you believe  
You're still the only one  
  
And the fire of our love  
Keeps me runnin' back to you  
And no matter where you are  
I will never be that far  
Away  
  
You're the only one for me  
I'm the only one for you  
Baby can't you see  
You're still the only one  
Each and every night I pray  
Hopin' there'll come a day  
Baby you believe  
You're still the only one  
Ain't no need to wonder why  
I'll love you 'till the day I die  
Baby I believe  
You're still the only one  
  
You're the only one  
You're the only one  
You're the only one for me sweet baby  
  
You're the only one  
You're the only one  
You're the only one for me sweet darlin'  
(repeats)  
  
When times are rough and hard  
With you is where I want to be, yeah  
Aw yeah  
  
When I am down and out, oh yeah  
With you is where I'll be  
Oh yeah  
  
Yeah yeah baby  
The only one for me  
Me  
Me, yeah

Where do I live  
Where is my wife?  
I am alone  
What's life worth living for?  
Where am I going and what am I looking towards?  
Where are my kids having their fights?  
Calling my name so I can kiss their sores  
  
I'm just a man on the run  
It's a bore  
  
So father can you tell me again  
Father can you tell me again that I'm livin'  
'Til I meet you on that day on the other side  
  
I'm internationally known  
With platinum and gold  
I've got millions sold  
But after the party, I'm left standing in the cold  
I would like to be a simple man  
I'd buy me a farm and live off the land  
Could a wife and some children be better than being in band?  
  
So father can you tell me again  
Father can you tell me again that I'm livin'  
'Til I meet you on that day on the other side  
  
On the other side  
  
So father can you tell me again  
Father can you tell me again that I'm livin'  
'Til I meet you on that day on the other side  
  
On the other side

If you could feel what I could feel  
Well then you'd know His love is real  
If you could hear what I could hear  
Well then you'd know the King is near  
  
The resurrection is here to stay  
And He's coming back again  
The resurrection is here to stay  
And He's coming back again  
To reclaim all His souls and set us free  
The resurrection is here to say  
That He's coming back again  
  
Look what He's done to me  
Now I am living in another space and time  
He walked on the righteous path  
To keep us from Satan's wrath  
We are not alone  
And we're going home  
  
The resurrection is here to say  
That He's coming back again  
To reclaim all His souls and set us free  
The resurrection is here to say  
  
That He is coming back again  
To reclaim all His souls and set us free.  
The resurrection is here to say  
That He's coming back again  
  
To reclaim all His souls, reclaim all His souls,  
Reclaim all His souls, reclaim all His souls, [Repeat: x 3]

You must be walking  
On shaky ground  
You're always jumping  
At every sound  
  
You've been a hustler for all your days  
A real motherfucker in every way  
  
When you're a loser you're all alone  
So you made up for everything  
That you thought you'd lost  
But you paid a cost  
Hey ...  
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
  
You're always running  
With every game  
First you're pushin' coke and then you're hoin' dames  
You say you can't give nothing better back  
  
Than you got back at home  
Well I tell you that's bullshit brother  
And that's a heavy load  
  
It's an illusion when you think you're the boss  
Oh no no no  
'Cause you really ain't got a thing  
But the crumbs you're tossed  
  
But don't you feel the frost  
Hey ...  
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall  
You can live your life for so long  
But when you're walking on thin ice you will fall

When I was just a boy  
My daddy sat me on his knee  
He told me that he loved  
Me and that we're a family  
  
He spoke about the world  
And all the possibilities  
Then he held me in his arms  
And said be what you want to be  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
It's how I got over  
  
When I became a man  
My daddy said come walk with me  
He said beeing a man  
Comes with responsibility  
  
And all is keep your word  
To the best of your ability  
Then he looked me in my eyes  
And said it's time to set you free  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
It's how I got over  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
It's how I got over  
  
He paved the way for me to follow  
Uncharted terrain now had a name  
It's how I got over

My friends feel it's their appointed duty  
They keep trying to tell me all you want to do is use me  
Uh huh but my answer about all that use me stuff  
  
I want to spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
You can keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
My brother sit me right down and he talked to me  
He told me that I ought to not let you just walk on me  
Well I'm sure that he meant well, yeah but when our talk was throught  
  
I said brother if you only knew you'd wish you were in my shoes  
You can keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
  
Sometimes it's true you really do abuse me  
Oh you get me in a crowd of high class people  
And you act real rude to me  
I said, oh baby, baby, baby, baby, when you love me I can't get enough  
  
I wanna spread the news that if it feels this good getting used  
You can keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up

Come on people  
It's time to get together  
It's time for the revolution!  
  
Here is once again in our face  
Why haven't we learn from our past  
We're at the crossroads of our human race  
Why are we kicking our own ass  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We're on the eve of destruction my friends  
We are about to go to far  
Politicians think that war is the way  
But we know that love has the power  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
The solution is simple and fame  
There won't be peace if we don't try  
In a war there is nothing to gain  
When so many people will die  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast  
  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
We want it yes  
We want peace  
And We want it fast

Did I work on the battlefield?  
Did I do what I thought was right?  
Did I do all that I could do?  
Did I put up a good fight?  
  
Did I love all that I should?  
To everyone in my sight?  
What did I do with my life?  
  
Did I exercise giving and forgiveness with all my might?  
Did I honor my freedom and did I live in the light?  
Did I cherish my moments?  
Did I take a good enough bite?  
What did I do with my life?  
  
You can live any way you want to  
All you have to do is dance  
Achieve anything you thought of  
You just have to take the chance  
You can fall in love with your life  
'Cause that truly is romance  
What did I do with my life?  
  
Did I learn what I came to learn?  
Did I listen with my heart?  
Did I do what I came to do?  
And how did I play the part?  
Did I see all the beauty?  
Because living is an art  
What did I do with my life?  
  
You can live any way you want to  
All you have to do is dance  
Achieve anything you thought of  
You just have to take the chance  
  
Learn to love your life  
'Cause that truly is romance  
Oh what did I do with my life?  
what did I do?  
say it again  
what did I do with my life?  
Oh what did I do?  
With my life  
What did I do?  
What did I do?

My pockets were full and now my money's gone  
My friends come around and now they're gone  
Things come and they come and then they go  
And where they go nobody knows  
  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
  
My cup over runneth with the fullness and grace  
Yet people push bullshit in my face  
The future can't hold what your money can't buy  
My brother keep striving your child relies  
  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
  
This world keeps on spinning does the future know?  
We're destined to screw ourselves one blow  
We've ruined what's pure down from nature below  
You'd better look back it'll all be gone  
  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
  
So children please listen this world is yours  
This message is too deep to ignore  
Your forefathers said but they did not do  
The things that would show that they cared for you  
  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
It's gonna come around  
What goes around comes around  
Comes around comes around comes around  
Comes around comes around comes around  
Comes around comes around comes around

A will we ever understand?  
Or is the fate of man at hand?  
Or will we live or shall we die?  
  
How will we ever know if we never try?  
The government's the Devil's hands  
It's a lie and it's a scam  
  
They wind us up, put us down  
And watch us go  
And if you close your eyes  
There's a big surprise  
  
What the fuck are we sayin'?  
Do we feel what we dream about?  
We've got to keep on a-prayin'  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
I've been lost in the name of love  
And we kill our brothers daily  
In the name of God  
  
We'd better chill before  
We take on some tribulation  
And if we realized  
And then we'll make a little love now sing  
  
What the fuck are we sayin'?  
Do we believe what we read about?  
We've got to keep on a-prayin'  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
What the fuck are we sayin'?  
Do we believe what we dream about?  
We've got to keep on a-prayin'  
And one day we'll see the light  
  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light  
And one day we'll see the light

Little girl with heroin so blue  
You've got to find the future in you  
Your scepters and needles will put you away  
Forever and a day  
  
Your future will haunt you before you get there  
Imagine the planet with no air  
All mute no light no sun only light  
As far away as neverland  
  
As the sky comes tumbling down to the head  
And the valleys are all filed up with dirt  
As many people as there are sands in the sea  
Will die the morning after  
  
So little girl with your heroin so blue  
I guess our future is all up to you  
Through the battle sequence you must fight  
'Til the morning turns to night  
  
So imagine our world with no air  
Just follow the son, he'll take you where  
The night and the seas are all full of light  
'Til the morning turns to night  
  
'Til the morning turns to night

I want to do this thing  
I don't want no drama mama  
It's love I bring  
  
Wait a minute  
You're out of sight  
Girl I wanna give it to you  
Let's make it right  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my life and my passion  
That never goes out of fashion  
I want to know  
Will you marry me  
  
Hey baby  
Will you wear my ring  
You're a queen and I've been waiting  
To be a king  
Baby, baby  
Let's keep it tight  
If you want to get right to it  
Could be tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh  
Come on baby  
Keep it tight  
I know its right  
I wanna have you always in my life  
Hit it  
Oh yeah  
No I like that  
Do that one more time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are my favorite attraction  
You give me real satisfaction  
I want to know  
Will you marry me  
  
You are my life and my passion  
That never goes out of fashion  
I want to know will you marry me

The sun is shining  
But I don't feel the rays  
The boats are sailing  
But I don't want to play  
  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
  
I live life in luxury  
But I believe it's a crime  
When you can't enjoy it  
And all the time cry  
  
Or maybe some kind of spell  
'Cause it feels like a curse  
When there's so much water  
But all the time thirst  
  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
  
My mind is a courthouse  
My soul is a jail  
My life is on death row  
'Cause you are not there  
  
I need a pardon  
I can't stand the pain  
What I'd do for your love now,  
If there's love to regain  
  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you  
I don't think I can make it  
Without you

I'm sorry your situation  
Has let you down  
I know that things did not go as planned  
'cause in this time you're feeling alone and sad  
This is what you must understand  
  
There is a way  
Yesterday is gone  
It's a new day  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
My dear kay  
  
You can't get nowhere  
Staying at home and crying  
You can't go on living in the past  
The one thing constant is that there is always change  
  
There is a way  
Yesterday is gone  
It's a new day  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
Yesterday is gone  
My dear kay

I want to be a better man  
Lord knows that I'm trying  
I want to keep the master's plan  
But sometimes things get wild  
Demons sleep with me in bed  
I can feel their fire  
When darkness gets around my head  
Sometimes I go blind  
  
But you were in my heart  
While the evil eye was searching out was staring at me  
But you were in my heart  
While the maids of doom, were reaching out and tempting me  
  
The world can give you everything  
Anything you want  
Money, fame  
And all it brings  
Whatever turns you on  
But your bloods running through my veins  
And I am standing tall  
But even though you took my place  
You are somehow bound to fall  
  
But you were in my heart  
While the evil eye was searching out was staring at me  
But you were in my heart  
While the maids of doom, were reaching out and tempting me
