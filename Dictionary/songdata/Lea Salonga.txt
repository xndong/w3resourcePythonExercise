(odette quesada)  
  
We used to be one  
I can remember when our hearts were very young  
You said our love would be forever  
But that was such a long, long time ago  
A long, long time ago  
Time and again  
I still remember day after day  
When you'd hold me close to you  
But they are just a part of yesterday  
Such a long, long time ago  
Why did it ever have to be this way?  
You promised me the moon, the sun, the stars above  
How come you suddenly ceased to look my way?  
Tell me the truth that you are certain of  
Look at me now  
The girl you once loved  
Look at me now  
Grown up but still in love with you  
Although it's such a long, long time ago  
Such a long, long time ago  
Why did it ever have to be this way?  
You promised me the moon, the sun, the stars above  
How come you suddenly ceased to look my way?  
Tell me the truth that you are certain of  
Look at me now  
The girl you once loved  
Look at me now  
Grown up but still in love with you  
Although it's such a long, long time ago  
Such a long, long time ago

My head's in a jam  
Can't take you off my mind  
From the time we met  
I've been beset by thoughts of you  
And the more that I ignore this feeling  
The more I find myself believing  
That I just have to see you again  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go  
But I know that I am much too shy  
To let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong words  
And displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
Like a child again  
I'm at a loss for words  
How does one define  
A crush combined with longing?  
Longing to possess you oh so dearly  
I'm obsessed by you completely  
I'll go mad if I can't have you  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go  
But I know that I am much too shy  
To let you know  
Afraid that I might say the wrong words  
And displease you  
Afraid for love to fade  
Before it can come true  
(instrumental)  
I can't let you pass me by  
I just can't let you go  
Let me say the things and say the words  
To let you know  
I would rather say the awkward words  
Than lose you  
Or for love to fade  
Before it can come true  

You with the sad eyes  
Don't be discouraged  
Oh I realize  
It's hard to take courage  
In a world full of people  
You can lose sight of it all  
And the darkness, that's inside you  
Can make you feel so small  
  
But I see your true colors  
Shining through  
I see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow  
  
Show me a smile then,  
Don't be unhappy, can't remember  
When I last saw you laughing  
If this world makes you crazy  
And you've taken all you can bear  
Just call me up  
Because you know I'll be there  
  
And I'll see your true colors  
Shining through  
And see your true colors  
And that's why I love you  
So don't be afraid to let them show  
Your true colors  
True colors are beautiful,  
Like a rainbow

In a while, in a word,  
Every moment now returns.  
For a while, seen or heard,  
How each memory softly burns.  
Facing you who brings me new tomorrows,  
I thank God for yesterdays,  
How they led me to this very hour,  
How they led me to this place...  
Every touch, every smile,  
You have given me in care.  
Keep in heart, always I'll,  
Now be treasuring everywhere.  
And if life should come to just one question,  
Do I hold this moment true?  
No trace of sadness,  
Always with gladness...  
'I DO...'  
(instrumental)  
Now a song that speaks of now and ever,  
Beckons me to someone new,  
Unexpected, unexplored, unseen,  
Filled with promise coming through.  
In a while, in a word,  
You and I forever change,  
Love so clear, never blurred,  
Has me feeling wondrous, strange,  
And if life should come to just one question,  
Do I face each moment true?  
No trace of sadness, always with gladness,  
'I DO...'  
Never with sadness...  
Always with gladness...  
'I...DO....'  

On the poor side of town, lives a girl no one knows  
With her worn out shoes and her ragged clothes  
Her mother tries to provide since her father has died  
But no one even cares if she's alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
She's never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
She'll still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in her eyes there's no teardrops  
In her heart there's no pain  
She's got her love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh, what love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
On the rich side of town, lives a boy no one knows  
With his shiny shoes and his fancy clothes  
He's got everything he needs if he wants to succeed  
But no one even cares if he's alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
He's never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
He'll still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in his eyes there's no teardrops  
In his heart there's no pain  
He's got his love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh, his love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
Isn't life feeling strange and money can't buy  
All you need to get by  
All around the world, there are folks no one knows  
If they're worn out shoes, their fancy clothes  
Will they find more there to give for and open the door  
To know that someone cares if they're alive  
  
And when the rain comes down  
We're never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
We'll still be smiling yet  
  
Cause in our eyes there's no teardrops  
In our hearts there's no pain  
We've got a love as an umbrella from the rain  
Oh, our love is an umbrella from the rain  
  
And when the rain comes down  
We're never getting wet  
And though the skies are gray  
We'll still be smiling yet  
(repeat 4x to fade)

Be still my heart  
Lately its mind is all its own  
It would go far and wide  
Just to be near you  
  
Even the stars, shining up bright  
I've noticed when you're close to me  
Still it remains a mystery.  
  
Anyone who's seen us  
Knows what's goin' on between us  
It doesn't take a genius  
To read between the lines  
  
And it's not just wishful thinking  
Or only me who's dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love.  
  
I ask myself why  
I sleep like a baby through the night  
Maybe it helps to know  
You'll be there tomorrow  
Don't open my eyes (ooh hoo-hoo)  
  
I'll wake from the spell I'm under  
Makes me wonder how (tell me how)  
I could live without you now.  
  
And what about the laughter  
The happy ever after?  
Like voices of sweet angels  
Calling out our names  
  
And it's not just wishful thinking  
  
Or only me who's dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love.  
  
All my life, I have dreamed of this  
But I could not see your face  
Don't ask why to such distant stars  
Can fall right into place.  
  
And it's not just wishful thinking  
Or only me who's dreaming  
I know what these are symptoms of  
We could be in love.  
  
...love.  
  
Oh, it doesn't take a genius  
To know what these are symptoms of  
We could be, oh hoh we could be  
We could be in love, we could be  
We could be in love.

I close my eyes  
And I can feel that you're a part of me  
You are my home  
Though I'm afar I'm in your company  
I'm in you  
  
I play my song  
And I can hear you're in my melody  
My life, my home  
No matter what with you I'll always be  
  
Refrain:  
You're my home  
And together we share this love for us  
To be happy and free  
You're my home  
And together we'll strive to make this world  
A better place to be  
  
Come take my hand  
Come fill your heart with all the love you see  
Let every child  
Be what they are, be what they want to be  
  
You're my home  
And together we share this love for us  
To be happy and free  
You're my home  
And together we'll strive to make this world  
A better place to be  
  
For you and me...
