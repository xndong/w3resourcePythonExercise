Feeling myself all of the time  
All of the time feeling alright  
Taking a while raising a smile makes it all worth while  
  
But if you wanted to find peace of mind  
Then you could find it any time you liked  
You are the afterglow  
  
Feeling my way all of the time  
All of the time doing just fine  
Taking a page out of my life  
Out of my life wouldn't it be nice  
  
But if you wanted to find peace of mind  
Then you couldn't find it any time you liked  
You are the afterglow  
  
You are the midnight show  
The only one I know  
You come and then you go  
And when you finally leave  
You leave nothing for me

Hey  
I would really like to talk with you  
Girl  
Do you have the time to stop  
Say  
All I want to do is rock  
If this was any other day  
I'd turn and walk the other way  
But today  
I'll stay  
Not walk away  
  
Hey  
I'm a foot without a sock  
Without you  
Love  
You seem to work around the clock  
Say  
All I want to do is rock  
If this was any other day  
I'd turn and walk the other way  
But today  
I'll stay  
Not walk  
Just rock  
  
Hey  
Love  
Say  
All I want to do is rock  
If this was any other day  
I'd turn and walk the other way  
But today  
I'll stay  
Okay

I'm a little boy  
In the world today  
Trying to live his life  
In a grown up way  
Sometimes I get so scared  
That I can hardly move  
But I'm a little boy  
With a lot to prove  
Some days go by so fast  
Sometimes I wonder  
How long will this young boy last?  
Now I'm an ancient train  
Going down the track  
I always make my way  
Never turning back  
Because my wheels are old  
Sometimes I ride real slow  
But I'm an ancient train  
With a place to go  
I used to ride so fast  
Sometimes I wonder  
How long will this old train last?  
Sometimes the song goes fast  
Sometimes I wonder  
How long will this old song last?

You can say what you want  
Say what you want  
But it won't change a thing  
Won't change a thing  
  
You can say what you want  
Say what you want  
But it won't change a thing  
Won't change a thing  
  
'Cause I saw you with another guy  
I saw you with another guy  
Yeah, I saw you with another guy  
Holding hands, kissing eye to eye  
  
You can cry all your like  
Cry all you like  
But it don't change a thing  
Don't change a thing  
  
You can cry all your like  
Cry all you like  
But it don't change a thing  
Don't change a thing  
  
'Cause I saw you with another guy  
I saw you with another guy  
Holding hands, kissing eye to eye  
Yeah, I saw you with another guy  
  
'Cause I saw you with another guy  
I saw you with another guy  
Yeah, I saw you with another guy  
Holding hands, kissing eye to eye  
  
You can say what you want  
Say what you want  
But it won't change a thing  
Won't change a thing  
  
You can say what you want  
Say what you want  
But it won't change a thing

Oh baby, baby  
How was I supposed to know  
That something wasn't right here  
Oh baby, baby  
I shouldn't have let you go  
And now you're out of sight  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now,  
Oh because  
  
[Chorus]  
My loneliness is killing me  
(and I)  
I must confess I still believe  
(still believe)  
If I'm not with you I lose my mind  
Give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
Oh baby, baby  
The reason I breathe is you  
Girl you got me blinded  
Oh pretty baby  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
It's not the way I planned it  
Show me how you want it to be  
Tell me baby 'cause I need to know now,  
Oh because  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh baby, baby  
How was I supposed to know  
Oh pretty baby, I shouldn't have let you go  
I must confess, that my loneliness  
Is killing me now  
Don't you know I still believe  
That you will be here  
And give me a sign  
Hit me baby one more time  
  
[Chorus]

When will you carry me home like the wounded star in the movie  
When will you carry me home take it back to the start when you knew me  
'Cause when you talk to me that way, I'll be a million miles away  
I guess it's just another day in love  
  
We're battleships, driftin' in our wee river  
Takin' hits, sinking it's now or never  
Overboard, drownin' in a sea of love and hate but it's too late  
Battleship down  
  
When will you figure it out that you aren't always right little darlin'  
When will you figure it out that it's not worth the fight little darlin'  
'Cause when you can't think what to say, you go and throw it all away  
I guess it's just another day in love  
  
We're battleships, driftin' in our wee river  
Takin' hits, sinking it's now or never  
Overboard, drownin' in a sea of love and hate but it's too late  
Battleship down  
  
But you're too smart and I'm too dumb  
With no heart in the middle  
  
We're battleships, driftin' in our wee river  
Takin' hits, sinking it's now or never  
Overboard, falling into the ocean  
Ship to shore, drownin' in a sea of love and hate but it's too late  
Battleship down

In the days before you were young  
We used to sit in the morning sun  
We used to turn the radio on  
What happened?  
We'd see our lies in the eyes of fate  
And take our cradles to the grave  
But even then we're never saved  
From danger  
  
And if you ever leave me come  
I will be there waiting  
Waiting for you know I will  
I love you for ever  
I'll never say never  
  
But I've only got two hands  
And I'll never learn to dance  
I'll never get a second chance  
Whatever  
I'll take the breath away from your sighs  
And wipe the tears away from your eyes  
And hope the fire never dies  
Inside you  
  
And if you ever leave me come  
I will be there waiting  
Waiting for you know I will  
I love you  
I love you  
I love you...  
  
In the days before you were young  
We used to sit in the morning sun  
We used to turn the radio on  
What happened?

Now you know that I heart everything about you  
And that's why it's quite hard to get through this alone  
  
You're the only one I can talk to about it  
In my darkest night I will be on my own  
  
These walls that we climb are hard to recognize  
They fall when I say your name  
  
Here we go  
Fast and slow  
On the big chair  
  
But we don't know  
Where we're going  
On the big chair  
  
Don't you know it's hard, quite, in the time of confusion  
To tell you that I love you  
  
You see it could have been me instead of you  
It could have been me if I wanted to  
But it wasn't  
So we'll have to face the truth  
  
These walls that we climb are hard to recognize  
They fall when I say your name  
  
Here we go  
Fast and slow  
On the big chair  
  
But we don't know  
Where we're going  
On the big chair  
  
Time to pull the shutters down  
Breakin' clouds don't make a sound?  
  
Here we go  
Fast and slow  
On the big chair  
  
But we don't know  
Where we're going  
On the big chair

When everything  
When everything was out of reach  
The sky was up  
The ground was right below our feet  
  
We played in toes  
We played in toes  
Cardboard boxes  
We played in boxes  
We played in boxes  
Cardboard boxes  
  
We wasted time  
We wasted time before we knew  
Don't punch the clock  
Or time will run away with you  
  
We live in boxes  
We live in boxes  
Concrete boxes  
We live in boxes  
We live in boxes  
Concrete boxes  
  
Now your childhood is over  
You're a man they have said  
You silently shoulder  
All the plans they have made  
You pack down your boxes and ask  
Who am I?  
  
The biggest trick  
The biggest trick they play on you  
To make you think  
The show won't go on without you  
  
We go in boxes  
We go in boxes  
Wooden boss  
We go in boxes  
We go in boxes  
Wooden boxes  
  
Now the room has been emptied  
I'm alone in my bed  
The heart is a box  
Which the soul has fled  
The spell has been broken  
And the last word is said

The snow was falling on his shoulders by the side of the road  
And he watched as the sun went down  
Falling on the building  
Swallowing the children  
It's the gun in your back  
It's the heart attack  
It's the way you look back before you step out  
  
In time to see the number of the bus that's running you down  
A million lonely people with their bead in the sand  
Trying to make some sense of what they don't understand  
Waiting on somebody just to give them a hand  
You're designed to fall apart on the day the warranty ends  
And you try but you just can't stop  
Running round in circles  
Knocking over hurdles  
It's the knife in your back  
It's the heart attack  
It's the way you look back before you step out  
In time to see the shadow of the one that's cutting you down  
  
The snow was falling on his shoulders by the side of the road  
And he watched as the lights came on below  
And the children were sleeping  
And the women were weeping  
There was nobody keeping him here

It's getting colder  
I'm standing looking down  
There's not a sound around the town  
It's getting colder  
Colder  
  
I would show everything  
But everything is too extreme  
We'll wait and see the entropy  
At the end when we all stop lying but the sky is falling down  
And there's an angel on the ground  
  
It's getting colder  
I'm standing looking down  
There's not a sound around the town  
It's getting colder  
  
The sky is falling down  
And there's an angel on the ground  
It's getting colder  
I'm standing looking down  
There's not a sound around the town  
It's getting colder  
  
The sky is falling down  
And all the people on the ground  
Are getting colder  
I'm standing looking down again  
But you can't help me now  
I'm getting colder

Never see you coming around  
They know they got their heads screwed on  
I'm standing in the middle of town  
I know I might never come home  
Just standing where I am with all the people passing by me  
The sound of all these passers-by mixed in with the bus and motor-car  
I must be sure these are the signs  
Cause I've been here a million times before  
  
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around  
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down  
Bringing you round  
  
Tell me if I'm bringing you down  
Cause I was fine till you came along  
You tell me that the tears of a clown cloud  
That I'm confusing while abusing my mind  
So far away I wanna be  
That's not as close to you and me  
The things they call our destiny  
Now why do you have to pick on me at all?  
My walls are coming down  
  
Just tell me when it's coming around, coming around  
I think I see you coming to town, hunting you down  
Coming around

How many times have you walked through my door  
How many times have you heard my song before  
How many lines until the end of time  
These are the days of our lives  
  
How many times did you hear mother say  
You would do fine if you didn't sleep all day  
Oh mother dear, I'll get a job next year  
These are the days of our lives  
  
How many times did you walk down the street  
Avoiding cracks that were thrown at your feet  
These rainy days were sent to make us pay  
But these are the days of our lives  
  
How many roads must a woman walk down  
How many walls will surround the town  
All that I am could get us out of here  
These are the days of our lives  
  
Did you believe in the stories at night  
Weren't you afraid when they turned out the light  
Oh, such a gas, I'm sorry it won't last  
These are the days of our lives  
  
These are the days that some of us regret  
These are the days we learn to forget  
These are the days that turn us out this way  
These are the days of our lives  
  
Of our lives

Don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there  
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead  
And don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by  
On by  
You know love is better than a song  
Love is where all of us belong  
So don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there  
You're there  
Don't be shy just let your feelings roll on by  
Don't wear fear or nobody will know you're there  
Just lift your head, and let your feelings out instead  
And don't be shy, just let your feeling roll on by  
On by, on by, etc.

Everything is open  
Nothing is set in stone  
Rivers turn to ocean  
Oceans tide you home  
Home is where your heart is  
But your heart had to roam  
Drifting over bridges  
Never to return  
Watching bridges burn  
  
You're driftwood floating underwater  
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces  
Just driftwood hollow and of no use  
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you  
  
Nobody is an island  
Everyone has to go  
Pillars turn to butter  
Butterflying low  
Low is where your heart is  
But your heart has to grow  
Drifting under bridges  
Never with the flow  
  
And you really didn't think it would happen  
But it really is the end of the line  
So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood  
But you've been drifting for a long long time  
  
Everywhere there's trouble  
Nowhere's safe to go  
Pushes turn to shovel's  
Shoveling the snow  
Frozen you have chosen  
The path you wish to go  
Drifting now forever  
And forever more  
Until you reach your shore  
  
You're driftwood floating underwater  
Breaking into pieces pieces pieces  
Just driftwood hollow and of no use  
Waterfalls will find you bind you grind you  
And you really didn't think it would happen  
But it really is the end of the line  
  
So I'm sorry that you turned to driftwood  
But you've been drifting for a long long time  
You've been drifting for a long long time  
You've been drifting for a long long  
Drifting for a long long time

You think  
I don't know  
I swear  
That I do  
This time  
On my hands  
  
I've had all this time  
And I got a kick out of you  
Now I'm falling down  
And I'm felling sick how 'bout you  
Oh I'm falling  
  
But you seem  
Out of sorts  
But I know  
We'll be fine  
These chances  
We take  
Time wastes  
So much time  
  
But I can't stand anymore  
Without falling down  
And I'm getting used to the floor  
Forever falling  
  
And I got a kick out of you  
Now I'm falling down  
And I'm feeling sick how 'bout you  
Oh I'm falling  
Yeah I'm falling

When I first held you I was cold  
A melting snowman I was told  
But there was no-one there to hold before  
I swore that I would be alone for ever more  
Wow look at you now  
Flowers in the window  
It's such a lovely day  
And I'm glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up, out in the crowd  
You are one in a million  
And I love you so  
Lets watch the flowers grow  
  
There is no reason to feel bad  
But there are many seasons to feel glad, sad, mad  
It's just a bunch of feelings that we have to hold  
But I am here to help you with the load  
  
Wow look at you now  
Flowers in the window  
It's such a lovely day  
And I'm glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up, out in the crowd  
You are one in a million  
And I love you so  
Lets watch the flowers grow  
  
So now we're here and now is fine  
So far away from there and there is time, time, time  
To plant new seeds and watch them grow  
So there'll be flowers in the window when we go  
  
Wow look at us now  
Flowers in the window  
It's such a lovely day  
And I'm glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up, out in the crowd  
You are one in a million,  
And I love you so  
Lets watch the flowers grow  
Wow look at you now  
Flowers in the window  
Its such a lovely day  
And I'm glad you feel the same  
Cause to stand up, out in the crowd  
You are one in a million  
And I love you so  
Let's watch the flowers grow  
Let's watch the flowers grow

Nobody really knows  
Where they're supposed to go  
Hiding behind a wall  
Afraid that they'll lose it all  
  
But it's alright  
Just follow the light  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
You'll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
But nobody wants to know  
'cos nobody even cares  
Everyone's on the make  
Yeah and everyone's out for themselves  
  
Me I'm on the longest road  
Where everything's overload  
But I've got my heart and soul  
So don't throw me overboard  
  
'cos it's alright  
Just follow the light  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
You'll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
'cos it's alright  
Just follow the light  
And don't be afraid of the dark  
In the moonlight  
You'll dance till you fall  
And always be here in my heart  
  
'cos it's alright, alright now  
And you're alright  
Yeah we're alright now

Wish someone would  
Write me a song  
Or tell me a story  
So I don't need to worry  
I need a little love  
And a hand to hold  
Somebody old  
To watch over me  
I need a little time  
So I don't have to hurry  
  
Oh, you say it all  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x3]  
But  
I don't wanna get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta wake up  
To the situation  
  
I wish someone  
Would answer  
The phone  
Stop leaving me  
Hanging on  
I'm feeling  
Like a little ship  
Out on the ocean  
I need a little love  
And a hand to hold  
Somewhere  
To hold the frustration  
I need a little cause  
For celebration  
  
Oh, you say it all  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x3]  
I don't wanna get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta wake up  
To the situation  
  
Growing up  
Checking notes  
So you know  
Just  
Just which way to go  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x4]  
You've just gotta  
You've just gotta  
You've gotta  
You've just gotta  
You've gotta gotta  
  
Oh, you say it all  
  
You gotta get up [Repeat: x3]  
I don't wanna get up  
You gotta get up  
You gotta get up

I've got a good feeling  
Like I know how I'm feeling  
Scraping me off the ceiling  
Back to that good feeling  
Now I find it hard living  
Wasting our time giving  
When will we all give in  
Into that good feeling  
Now I got a good feelin'  
Like I know how I'm feelin'  
Scrappin' me off the ceiling  
Back to that good feeling  
  
You picked a time a very fine time  
To look at me you'd see that I was fine  
You're happy too just towing on your line  
But you're afraid of what you'll find behind  
  
In twenty years from now I'll be the same  
And you'll be changing all the letters  
In your maiden name  
Ah you're thikin' that we're one  
But we'll never be the same  
  
'cause I got a good feeling  
That I know I'm not missing  
Anything you're giving  
Isn't worth this good feeling

Just a simple suggestion  
That you don't need to follow  
We could make it out of here  
  
We could be there tomorrow  
'Cos there's always tomorrow  
You're so silly, oh so silly  
Especially just ordinary  
We've got nothing to hurt now  
We're green behind the ears  
  
Just a pocket of people  
With their ordinary faces  
As the crow flies  
They got further to fly  
Without a word or a lie

I'm high high high as a kite  
I'm high high high as a kite  
And I just might try and do it tonight  
But only when the time is right  
  
I'm low low low as you go  
I'm low though I've been here before  
If I go any lower you know  
I'm gonna tell you that the time is right  
  
I thought today the grey would all go away  
That the blue was there so roses were red  
But instead the red has gone to his bed  
Oh no  
  
I'm high high high as a kite  
I'm high high high as a kite  
And I just might try and do it tonight  
But only when the time is right  
  
Yeah I just might try and do it tonight  
But only when the time is right

How many hearts  
Does it take to break  
All of the bonds  
That young lovers make  
Hoping to find  
The next golden egg  
One that will shine  
Through the rest of time  
  
How many roads  
Must there need to be  
Hoping inside  
You could mean to me  
Open your mouth  
Build your sermon there  
Give me more time  
Do the best I can  
  
Hopelessly hoping our plan will wake up  
Hoping it all will be fine  
Holding our candles through weather or not  
Love be the enemy now  
Now for the rest of time  
  
A long time ago  
There was only me  
And there was no  
Rings eternally  
Won't be the same  
No one there to blame  
No longer care  
  
And you are, and you are a new age  
  
Hopelessly hoping our plan will wake up  
Hoping it all will be fine  
Holding our candles through weather or not  
Love be the enemy now  
Now for the rest of time  
  
And you are and you are a new age

Turn me on to something  
I don't want to be alone  
My heart is like a stone and it's sinking  
  
Stay with me, I didn't mean to hurt you  
Don't you know  
I didn't get where I am with much thinking  
  
And I'm not sentimental  
But I know where I belong  
  
Come out and fight  
For love and life  
Tell me things 'til I forget my name  
  
Speak your mind  
And learn your lines  
Tell me things 'til I forget my name  
  
The say that if you hate yourself  
You like yourself enough  
You like yourself enough to be a hater  
  
But you can't get enough  
Of all that unrequited stuff  
So open up to love and see what's there  
  
And I'm not much of anything  
But know where I belong  
  
Come out and fight  
For love and life  
Tell me things 'til I forget my name  
  
Sing your life  
And learn your lines  
Tell me things 'til I forget my name  
  
Is this the best that we can do for one another  
Asking the questions thinking of another  
When you better come out fighting for your life  
  
Come out and fight  
For love and life  
Tell me things 'til I forget my name  
  
Speak your mind  
Sing your lines  
Tell me things 'til I forget my name

There's a man on the street,  
And he looks at his feet form his window.  
And he swears at the sun,  
And he curses the moon for its shadow.  
  
Take a leaf from his book  
Take a thread from his suite  
He's a new man  
  
And he prays to his god  
That he reaps his reward  
For his new plan  
  
Oh, the mold has been cast  
The radio's in the bath  
Yeah yeah yeah  
  
Labor tuus nunc ad terminum  
Sed per deos, vade retro  
Nomen nusquan video  
Carbo in culo in aeternitatem  
Placet satanae te vedere

I look around for faces I know  
I never ever want to go home  
My friends are in bed but I'm best on my own  
I'm terrified of driving a car  
  
Afraid I'm afraid of the dark  
But it happened before in a different bar  
And I know it's late but won't you take me home  
I must have thought of getting out now  
  
But how am I gonna get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
  
It's easier to stare at the sun  
Than look at all the things that you've done  
Intentions were good but so was the fun  
And you know it's wrong it can't go on for long  
  
I must have thought of getting out now  
But how am I going to get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
Just the faces change  
  
I must have thought of getting out now  
But how am I going to get out  
When even the names stay the same  
Just the faces change  
Just the faces change

Everything that you know is as wrong as the next  
So you hold on to something and hope for the best  
And you know that it's right 'til you find that it's left  
And I'm doing the same and I have to confess  
  
That I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
All my senses are pushing the whole other way  
I can't see where to look now what's that that you say?  
It's a beautiful world it's a beautiful day  
And I wish I could say if I was feeling the same  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
I need an Obi-wan to tell me if I've gone astray  
  
And I wish it was clearer to see  
If you are what you're made out to be  
But there's no guarantee if you're you and I'm me  
And there never will be, 'til I can see what you see  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be nothing and no one to show you the way  
I know nothing  
When all I do is make it through to the end of the day  
  
When I know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be  
Know nothing  
I never knew that there'd be

Rain on the brain  
Now there's flowers in your window  
She, well she's so strange  
I don't know anything about her  
But if it's all the same to you  
Here's what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna write a song  
Gonna sing it to everyone  
And then I'll sing it to you  
'cos it was you that wrote it too  
This could be the last train  
  
Search within yourself for feelings  
Everybody's got them  
You left me on the shelf  
And now there's no-one to rely on  
But if it's all the same to you  
Here's what I'm gonna do  
I'm gonna buy a gun  
Gonna shoot eberything, everyone  
And then I'm coming for you  
'cos it was you that drove me to  
This could be the last train  
  
Woo-woo  
Woo-woo  
Woo-woo  
Woo-woo  
Rear window  
Wit the room in her hair  
And on her jacket  
There's a picture of che guevara  
As he sits beneath the tree  
But that's not important  
But he look a bit like me  
If you took all the little feelings in your heart  
And took all those little feelings apart  
Oh well now  
What's the point in doing all of that?

Who cheers you up  
When you are down  
Who brings you cups of coffee  
Who picks you up  
When you're in town  
Whatever makes you happy  
And I'm glad you're better now  
But I'm sad you're not around  
Friends  
Won't ever desert you  
Or turn against  
Friends  
Won't love you and leave you  
To mend the fence  
Who wakes you up  
When you're late for work  
Who makes the bed so lovely  
Who found your sock  
Who pressed your shirt  
Whatever makes you love me  
And I'm glad I'm better now  
But I'm just sad you're not around  
Friends  
Will never deceive you  
Or turn against  
Friends  
Won't love you and leave you  
To mend the fence...

It's a long way down  
Above the two tone town  
And it's no funny when you're stuck in the middle  
I'm coming up for air  
I could be anywhere  
It makes no difference when you live in a puddle  
Now that I see it  
How can I breath  
When my heart's in my mouth  
And not on my sleeve  
Better run little rabbit  
Back to your hole in the ground  
It's a long way down  
It's a long way down  
The people look so small  
Sliding off the wall  
Getting dizzy as the fall in the gutter  
I watch the seagull  
Swooping past the steeple  
Crying for his dinner as he shits on the sinners  
Now that I see it  
How can I breathe  
When my heart's in my mouth  
Instead of my sleeve  
Better run little rabbit  
Back to your hole in the ground  
It's a long way down  
Mama  
An eye for an eye  
You'd say you'd never take a side  
Papa  
I'm too young to die  
They're never taking me  
They're never taking me alive  
They're never taking me alive  
They're never taking me alive

If I told you a secret  
You won't tell a soul  
Will you hold it and  
Keep it alive  
  
Cause it's burning a hole  
And I can't get to sleep  
And I can't live alone  
In this lie  
  
So look up, take it away  
Don't look down  
The mountain  
  
If the world isn't turning  
Your heart won't return  
Anyone, anything, anyhow  
  
So take me, don't leave me  
Take me, don't leave me  
Baby, love will come through  
It's just waiting for you  
  
And you stand at the crossroads  
Of highroads and low roads  
And I've got a feeling  
It's right  
  
If it's real what I'm feeling  
There's no make believing  
The sound of the wings  
Of the flight  
  
Of a dove, take it away  
Don't look down  
The mountain  
  
If the world isn't turning  
Your heart won't return  
Anyone, anything, anyhow  
  
So take me, don't leave me  
Take me, don't leave me  
Baby, love will come through  
It's just waiting for you  
  
Oh, look up, take it away  
Don't look down  
  
If the world isn't turning  
Your heart won't return  
Anyone, anything, anyhow  
  
So take me, don't leave me  
Take me, don't leave me  
Baby, love will come through  
It's just waiting for you  
  
Love will come through  
Love will come through  
Love will come through

What's so wrong?  
Why the face so long  
Is it over?  
And where you going that  
You no longer belong here?  
And distance tells you that  
Distance must come between love  
Where have you been luv?  
When the mistake we made  
Was in never having planned to fall in love, luv  
  
Singing this song  
Singing along  
Makes it easier for me to see you go  
But in doing so  
I'm letting you go  
It only serves to show me  
That I'm still in love with you  
  
Singing this song  
Singing along  
Makes it easier for me to see you go  
But in doing so  
In letting you go  
It only serves to show me  
That I'm still in love with you  
  
So what's so wrong?  
Why the face?  
So long  
Are you changing?  
And where you been to that  
You no longer remember?  
And distance tells you that  
Distance must come between love  
Where have you been luv?  
  
It's just the chance we took  
Having never planned to fall in love, luv  
Having never planned to fall in love, luv  
Having never planned to fall in love, luv  
Luv

More than us  
And we are them  
But they don't know  
What's in their hands  
It's more than you  
And it's more than  
I but it's more  
And everybody calls it love  
But I'm not really sure if it's love  
At all  
  
Not anymore  
More than he  
More than she  
They all sleep  
But we just dream  
More or less  
Means more for us  
But it's more  
And everybody wants a hand  
But I'm too busy holding up the world  
To carry on  
  
No not anymore  
I wish that I  
Could fly fly fly away  
And if I should fall  
And you hear me call  
Would you stay  
More than us  
And we are them  
  
But they don't know  
What's in our heads  
It's more than you  
And it's more than  
I but it's more  
And everybody calls it love  
But I'm not really sure if this is love  
At all  
  
Not anymore  
Anymore  
Anymore

Mother take that ride  
You got in my mind  
Tell 'em what you found  
Write it down  
  
What you have is enough  
What you want with so much stuff  
What you need is a hug  
From a passenger you love  
One you love  
One you love  
One you love  
One you love  
  
Write a book  
Change your name  
Run a thousand miles away  
Bite the hook  
Change your game  
In the end it's all the same  
Happy ever after  
Dancing with disaster  
Hold me close and listen to the song  
Why did we wait so long?  
Oh, why did we wait so long?  
  
Once upon a cold and starless night  
Saw a vision or a trick of light  
We know there's nothing wrong  
Days are short, nights are long  
Answer me this question then I'm gone  
Oh, why did we wait so long?  
Oh, why did we wait so long?  
  
Oh, why did we wait so long?  
Oh, why did we wait so long?  
Oh, why did we wait so long?

I didn't ever mean to steal from you  
But how could I resist?  
When everything you are and say and do  
Is perfect as it is.  
  
I didn't really mean to go this far  
But now I've broken in  
And now I wanna stay and stay away  
From every place I've been  
  
You see  
These old record sleeves  
Don't keep me warm at all  
The TV won't answer me  
Like all the people on my wall.  
  
I only want to try to be your friend  
If you don't have enough  
Sometimes I think you know that in the end  
That you and I are us.  
  
You see  
These old record sleeves  
Don't keep me warm at all  
The TV won't answer me  
Like all the people on my wall.  
  
And I don't mind  
If you don't write  
Or call on me  
One day the faces  
On my wall  
Will fall for me.  
  
I don'I how any choice  
A little voice  
Says I belong to you  
And you won't ever be  
Rid of me  
No matter what you do  
  
You see  
These old record sleeves  
Don't keep me warm at all  
The TV won't answer me  
Like all the people on my wall.

I wake up to find you laying awake  
With your hands in your head  
You cannot run, can't escape from the things  
That you say-ay-ay  
  
And you can tell anybody  
Anybody who comes  
You can tell anybody  
But the damage's done  
The new day's begun.  
  
One night can change everything in your life  
One night can make everything alright  
One night can turn all your colors to white  
One night - it's easier said than done  
  
Turning and turning but never returning  
To what you once had  
Learning to care for the ones you hold dear  
But it's too... it's too bad  
  
One night can change everything in your life  
One night can make everything alright  
One night can turn all your colors to white  
One night - it's easier said than done  
  
All that I am  
All that I am  
All that I am  
  
Laying beside you as cold as a statue  
Your hands are still warm  
Trying to wake you as daylight brakes through  
The eye of the storm.  
  
So you can tell everybody  
Everybody who comes  
You can tell everybody  
But the damage's done  
The new day's begun.  
  
One night can change everything in your life  
One night can make everything alright  
One night can turn all your colors to white  
One night - it's easier said than done  
  
One night... one... one night... one...  
One night - it's easier said than done

When the day is done  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be the one  
  
When the day is through  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be with you  
  
Tell me what to do  
Oh Molly Molly  
Let me follow through  
  
'Cause I am lost at sea  
Oh Molly Molly  
Haven't got a clue  
  
All I have to show  
For all the years below  
Only Molly knows  
  
When the lights go down  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will you be around  
  
When the lights are gone  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will you leave the town  
  
Tell me what is wrong  
Oh Molly Molly  
Let me sing a song  
  
'Cause I have lost the will  
Oh Molly Molly  
Cannot carry on  
  
All I have to show  
For all the years below  
Only Molly knows  
  
When the day is done  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be the one  
  
When the day is through  
Oh Molly Molly  
Will I be with you  
  
Tell me what to do  
Oh Molly Molly  
Let me follow through  
  
Where are we to be tomorrow Molly  
Haven't got a clue  
  
All I have to show  
For all the years below  
Only Molly knows

Paperclips, melody  
Hold together all these memories  
Memories  
Memories  
I don't want to think at all  
  
I don't want to be like you anymore  
I don't want to see your face at my door  
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure  
I don't want to be like you anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
Take a trip, down memory lane  
You will never want to go again  
Take your leave  
Take your leave  
I don't want to sing at all  
  
I don't want to be like you anymore  
I don't want to see your face at my door  
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure  
I don't want to live like you anymore, anymore, anymore  
  
Ever talk, decide out  
We get by, we'll get by  
And I won't take this  
No more sadness, no, no  
  
Paperclips, memories  
Hold together all these melodies  
Melodies  
Melodies  
I don't want to sing at all  
  
I don't want to be like you anymore  
I don't want to see your face at my door  
And I'll never leave like you, that's for sure  
I don't want to live like you anymore, anymore, anymore

I read it all, every word  
And I still don't understand a thing  
What had you heard?  
What had you heard  
Was it love, was it take another walk in the dark?  
  
You'll never learn  
I'd pray to God if there was heaven  
But heaven seems so very far from here  
And it all boils down to the same old thing  
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
Whether you win or lose isn't gonna change a single thing  
  
I stood in line and a thought crossed my mind  
I had been dreaming but I didn't mind  
I signed the line and the woman looked right through me  
She didn't smile  
  
I'd pray to God if there was heaven  
But heaven seems so very far from here  
And it all boils down to the same old thing  
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pipe dreams  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
Whether you win or lose isn't gonna change a single thing  
  
I'd pray to God if there was heaven  
But heaven seems so very far from here  
And it all boils down to the same old thing  
Just a yin and a yang or a couple of pints please  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
Whether you win or lose isn't gonna change a single thing  
  
And it all boils down to the same old feat  
Just a link in a chain, just a puppet on a string  
And it all boils down to the same old pain  
  
Whether you win or you lose  
Whether you win or you lose  
Whether you win or you lose  
Whether you win or you lose

Celebrate, don't be late  
Finish what's on your plate  
Be the change you wanna see  
Seek the truth, set it free  
  
And I wanna tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
  
Why does time move so fast?  
Precious things never last  
Figure out, don't forget  
Only love, no regrets  
  
And I gotta tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
  
All of the things you never noticed  
All of the lines you cling to that don't mean a thing  
All of the dates that you were late for  
All of the rounds you should've paid for  
  
And I wanna tell you  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder  
This is a reminder

Cheers  
Thanks for everything  
You hung me out by my heart  
You're just so selfish jean  
Yes you are  
  
Hey you  
Threw it all away  
By holding everything in  
Hey Jean don't rock the boat  
When you can't swim  
  
With a perfect understanding of the finer things in life  
A quite alarming knack of knowing when to twist the knife  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Here's to you  
Who read everything  
Left it out on the shelf  
There's no one else to blame  
Except yourself  
  
Well a perfect combination of good etiquet and charm  
You keep the chocolate biscuits wired to a car alarm  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Well I'm standing on my own  
And this house is not a home  
It's so sad to see you go  
Things are high, things are low  
And it's good to know you know  
If you've got nowhere to go  
Well you could spend the night with me  
There will be no guarantee that I'll be here  
  
In the morning  
Or any time that you call  
I hear you snoring Jean  
Through the wall  
  
So hey  
Here's to everything  
To peace and love in our time  
Ah Jean the slate is clean  
I guess we're fine  
  
Well I don't expect a miracle  
Not asking you to change  
If you can see me happy  
Well just look the other way  
Ooh  
Selfish Jean  
  
Heah  
Selfish Jean  
  
Jean  
Oh yeah  
Jean

She's so strange  
And she wore a black mustache  
And pilfered all the petty cash  
She went to Birmingham  
She'll soon be in the can  
  
She's so cruel  
And she knew what just what to do  
And while the cats were all sniffing glue  
They played their silly games  
And now they'll take the blame  
  
What she'd done  
And she didn't know quite what she did  
And they told her that she better had  
So now she starts to cry  
Without a reason why  
  
She's so poor  
And only now she's looking back  
Sees her story on a paperback  
What will become of her  
There's not much left for her

Baby, you've been going so crazy  
Lately, nothing seems to be going right  
Solo, why do you have to get so low  
You're so  
You've been waiting in the sun too long  
  
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing  
For the love you bring won't mean a thing  
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing  
  
Colder, crying on your shoulder  
Hold her, and tell her everything's gonna be fine  
Surely, you've been going to early  
Hurry, cause no one's gonna be stopped  
  
But if you sing, sing, sing, sing, sing, sing  
For the love you bring won't mean a thing  
Unless you sing, sing, sing, sing  
  
Baby, there's something going on today  
But I say nothing, nothing, nothing,  
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing

Today is the day  
For dancing and for singing  
The birds in the trees and all  
The bells are ringing  
The sun is in the sky  
Is bright as bright second light  
Is bright oh god I hope I'm alright  
  
Cause I'm gonna cry  
Hold on, hold on  
Slow down, slow down  
You're out of touch  
Out of touch  
'Cause there is no design for life  
There's no devil's haircut in my mind  
There is not a wonder wall to climb  
To climb or step around  
But there is a slide show and it's so slow  
Flashing through my mind  
  
Today was the day  
But only for the first time  
Hold on, hold on  
Slow down, slow down  
You're out of touch  
Out of touch  
  
'Cause there is no design for life  
There is no devil's haircut in your mind  
There is not a wonder wall  
To climb or step around  
But there is a sideshow and it's so slow  
Flashing through my mind  
  
Today was the day  
But only for the first time  
I hope it's not the last time

In the church one day you will get hurt  
In the school teacher's such a fool  
And if they would ever come 'round here  
They would ever come  
Blame it on my style, take a pill  
Don't tell me how to feel  
Bad news and tunes  
Sing it from the high  
Singin' some sad song  
Uncle Sam, playin' in the sand  
Understand, hold my hand  
Time is never gonna stop runnin'  
Never gonna stop  
Take me to the top of the trees  
Don't take me for a cracked window pane  
Bad news and tunes  
Are shinin' from the high  
Singin' some sad song  
Don't rehearse, this is the last verse  
In the hearse, goin' through your purse  
And if they would ever laugh, not here  
They would ever laugh  
Blame it on my style, once again  
Don't take me for a ride in the rain  
Bad news and tunes  
Shinin' from the high  
Singin' some sad song  

Like a melody that is impossible to play away  
In my memory there's a part of you that's gone away  
To keep my mind from wondering  
I'm wondering  
To keep myself on falling  
I'm following  
  
[Chorus]  
Something Anything just to keep on living  
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer  
Something Anything just to keep on living  
Just to keep on breathing for a moment longer  
  
I'd tell you anything if I had anything to say ehh  
I keep a battle in 'cause there's a time and there's a place for this  
I keep my story where it is  
An act this it  
Don't even all wanna this  
When all I need is  
  
[Chorus]

Home and away  
Life goes on the same  
We bury the pain  
And hold on to love  
Hear the song  
Sing along  
  
But what does it change this life is so confusing  
Feel like I'm always losing  
  
We come in  
Knowing everything  
But don't say a word  
Till they teach it away  
Words are found  
Too close to the edge that we don't dare say  
  
And this will turn into something else  
Something else  
And when it does I'll be somewhere else  
Somewhere else  
Where else?  
  
And you say I should be myself  
Despite all the wrong (dragging you back)  
Forgive and then forget and on and on and on and on  
  
This life is so confusing feels like I'm always losing  
And this will turn into something else  
Something else  
And when it does I'll be somewhere else  
Somewhere else  
Where else?

You broke the bread  
We drank the wine  
Your lip was bleedin' but it was fine  
Come on inside, babe, across the line  
I love you more than i  
  
But then this bird just flew away  
She was never meant to stay  
Oh to keep her caged would just delay the spring  
  
You broke your word  
Now that's a lie  
We had a deal that you would try  
Come on inside, girl, I think it's time  
High time we drew the line  
  
But then this bird just flew away  
While I looked the other way  
Oh to keep her caged would just delay the spring  
  
Oh you broke my soul  
Dear you stole the plot  
You left an empty shot  
There's nothing left here 'cos you took the lot  
  
An empty cage is all I've got  
'cos when your bird has flown away  
She was never meant to stay  
Oh to keep her caged would just delay the spring  
To keep her caged would just delay the spring

I stayed in town for a while  
Watching cars pass me by  
And I'm trying not to get too high  
But then I realized  
  
Is there only one direction  
Is there only right from wrong  
Got to make the right connection  
On my own  
  
I never said you would cry  
But I lied, now I lied  
Now he's crying just to get by  
Just to find, find out why  
  
There is only one direction  
There is only right from wrong  
Got to make the right connection  
On their own  
  
I stuck around for a while  
Watch the grass getting high  
And I try not to think for a while  
But then I had to smile  
  
'Cause there's only one direction  
Is there only one way home  
Got to make the right connection  
On their own

Do you remember?  
Do you remember?  
Do you remember,  
How you were gonna stay free?  
But they had plans for you  
And things to do  
The same thing goes for me  
Well, well I never  
Saw it coming to me  
But when I turn around to look at you  
It was all that I could do  
  
To see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And I'm no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
In the beginning  
Everything was so close  
And it seems that everywhere you go  
Everybody knows  
You don't remember  
What you wanted to be  
Well they went round the class  
And you were last  
The clock was fast  
So no-one asked  
  
To see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And I'm no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
Well how long can you run?  
How far and what fun?  
How far will you run,  
To get whatever you're after?  
You're after  
You're after  
You're  
  
Well I've been looking  
And I still can't see  
How we get from A to be to see  
And feel like should be  
Well I've been running  
But I've been running around  
Now there's nothing left  
For me to do  
But sit around  
And see the view  
  
And see the distance  
Everybody wants to run  
And I'm no different  
Feeling like the only one  
  
Do you remember?  
Do you remember?  
Do you remember?

When the laughter fade away  
Ma vie  
Tout ma vie  
When there's nothing left to say  
Ma vie  
My oh my  
  
It's the last laugh of the laughter  
Sur la dernier page do chapitre  
On the last day of the year  
Ma vie  
Tout ma vie  
When the spotlight fade away  
  
Ma vie  
C'est la vie  
When the blue skies turns to grey  
Ma vie  
Tout ma vie  
It's the last laugh of the laughter  
Sur la dernier page do chapitre  
On the last day of the year  
Ma vie  
Tout ma vie  
When the laughter fades away  
  
Ma vie  
Tout ma vie  
When there's nothing more to say  
Ma vie  
My oh my  
  
It's the last laugh of the laughter  
Sur la dernier page do chapitre  
On the last day of the year  
Ma vie  
Tout ma vie  
Ma vie

Look at me I'm so disgusting  
I will never find another  
Quite like you  
You make me blue  
With the things you do  
  
Look at you you're so familiar  
We could be so cool together  
All the time  
Could all be fine  
  
We're on the line  
The line is fine  
Open up ma window  
The line is fine  
  
Standing on the ledge  
Well I don't look down  
Looking at the people  
Well they all look fine  
  
It's not just life or death  
Yesterday we talked together  
But tonight it's just the weather  
Chillin' me  
  
What's the point in silly talking  
We could get there quicker walking  
Down the line  
Could all be fine  
But we're on the line  
The line is fine  
  
Open up the window  
The line is fine  
Standing on the ledge  
Well I don't look down  
Looking at the people  
Well they all look fine  
  
But staring at the faces  
Standing in a row  
Thinking of all the places  
That they have yet to go  
they don't know  
  
Open up the window  
The line is fine  
Standing on the ledge  
Well I don't look down  
Looking at the people  
Well they all look fine  
It's not just life or death  
The line is fine  
It's not just life or death  
The worst line is mine  
  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
The line is fine  
  
Fine  
Fine  
Fine

I pulled into Nazareth, was feelin' 'bout half past dead  
I just need some place where I can lay my head  
"Hey, mister, can you tell me where a man might find a bed?"  
He just grinned and shook my hand, and "No" was all he said  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Picked up my bag, went lookin' for a place to hide  
When I saw Carmen and the Devil walkin' side by side  
I said, "Hey, Carmen, come on, let's go downtown"  
She said, "I gotta go, but m'friend can stick around"  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Go down, Miss Moses, there's nothin' you can say  
It's just old Luke, and Luke's waitin' on the Judgement Day  
"Well Luke, my friend, what about young Anna Lee?"  
He said, "Do me a favour, son, won't you stay an' keep Anna Lee company?"  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Crazy Chester followed me, and he caught me in the fog  
He said, "I will fix your rack, if you'll take Jack, my dog"  
I said, "Wait a minute, Chester, I'm a peaceful man"  
He said, "That's OK, just feed him when you can"  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me  
  
Catch a cannon ball now, to take me down the line  
My bag is sinking low and I do believe it's time  
To get back to Miss Fanny, you know she's the only one  
Who sent me here with her regards for everyone  
  
Take a load off Fanny  
Take a load for free  
Take a load off Fanny  
And (and) (and) you can put the load right on me

We're tied to the 90's  
In the middle  
I'm terribly frightened  
I'm takin' it fast  
Takin' it slow  
There's thunder and lightning  
It's terribly frightening  
Lord knows  
Where it goes  
But I know  
That if so  
Well I want to tell you  
We're tired of the 90's  
We're tired of the 90's  
But we're tied to the 90's  
Tied to the 90's  
  
Remember the 80's?  
(they were something)  
Were worse than the 90's  
We're stuck in a path  
Where fashion is fast  
And nothin' is lasting  
Its all ghetto blasting  
And Lord knows  
Where it goes  
But I know  
That if so well I want to tell you  
We're tired of the 90's  
We're tired of the 90's  
But we're tied to the 90's  
Tied to the 90's  
  
Ah oh no  
It's nothing to go on  
The hifi five alive  
That's it I'm stayin' in bed  
'til my hair falls out  
Everything's over  
That said I like my wig  
And I hate myself  
I know its all in my head  
We're tired of the 90's (x3)  
But we're tied to the 90's  
Oh we're tied to the 90's  
We're tied to the 90's  
We're tied to the nines  
Tied to the nines  
Tied to the 90's

I want to see what people saw  
I want to feel like I felt before  
I want to see the kingdom come  
I want to feel forever young  
I want to sing  
To sing my song  
I want to live in a world where I belong  
I want to live  
I will survive  
And I believe that it won't be very long  
  
If we turn, turn, turn, turn, turn  
Then we might learn  
So where's the stars?  
Up in the sky  
And what's the moon?  
A big balloon  
We'll never know unless we grow  
There's so much world outside the door  
  
I want to sing  
To sing my song  
I want to live in a world where I'll be strong  
I want to live  
I will survive  
And I believe that it won't be very long  
  
If we turn, turn, turn, turn  
And if we turn, turn, turn, turn  
Then we might learn  
Turn, turn, turn, turn  
Turn, turn, turn  
And if we turn, turn, turn, turn  
Then we might learn  
Learn to turn

I met a girl in L.A  
The million dollar kind  
She was all for all or nothing  
She was open all the time  
  
But when I called her number  
Her mother's on the line sayin'  
You've no business  
As god's my witness  
  
With a child as young as mine  
So make sure that she's old enough  
Before you blow your mind  
She may look like she knows enough  
  
But look in her eye  
And if so  
Let her go  
You'll let her down in style  
  
I met a girl in paris  
She talked like vera lynn  
And her eyes were full of dew drop  
The moment I walked in  
  
She was awfully nice  
The kind that likes to win  
But if I'd been wiser  
A whole lot wiser  
  
Then I might have thought again

I don't want to rock, baby don't want to rock  
I just feel I'm stuck up against the clock  
I don't really want to rock tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
  
I don't want to roll, baby don't want to roll  
I just feel I'm cold like I'm getting old  
I don't really want to roll tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please, please don't turn out the light  
  
Rock'n'roll village man  
Northern soul peter pan  
Rock'n'roll rocket man  
Skater phase desperate Dan  
Rock'n'roll never sounded better  
  
I don't want to be, baby don't want to be  
I just feel it's me falling off the tree  
I don't really want to be tonight  
I only want to keep you right  
  
I don't want to try, baby don't want to try  
I just feel I'm dry trying to get by  
I don't really want to try tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please, please don't turn out the light  
  
Rock'n'roll rocket man  
Skater phase desperate Dan  
Rock'n'roll village man  
Northern soul peter pan  
  
You can...  
I don't want to rock, baby don't want to rock  
I just feel I'm stuck up against the clock  
I don't really want to rock tonight  
I only want to keep you right  
  
I don't want to roll, baby don't want to roll  
I just feel I'm cold like I'm getting old  
I don't really want to roll tonight  
I only want to hold you tight  
Please, please don't turn out the light

I was walking along in the sun  
Taking pictures of everyone  
And there's something on the tip of my tongue  
Oh  
  
Well it's easy to see from afar  
And it's easy to be on your guard  
But it's harder just to be who you are  
Oh  
  
When all these  
People who will lead you down the back of the track  
They're on your back  
They will try and tear you apart  
But believe and you will see that there's no reason to doubt  
Then you will find  
You can do much better than that  
If you think of all the things that you feel  
All the voices in your head that you hear  
It's a mystery that we are all still holding on  
  
When all these  
People who will lead you down the back of the track  
They're on your back  
They will try and tear you apart  
But believe and you will see that there's no reason to doubt  
And you will find  
You can do much better than that  
  
If you see me hit the ground  
Don't come near don't make a sound  
  
I was walking along in the sun  
Taking pictures of everyone  
And there's something on the tip of my tongue

Our conversation was short and sweet  
It nearly swept me off-a my feet  
And I'm back here in the rain  
Oh and you are on dry land  
  
You made it there somehow  
You're a big girl now  
Bird on the horizon, sittin' on a fence  
He's singin' a song for me at his own expense  
  
And I'm just like that bird  
Oh singin' just for you  
I hope that you can hear  
Hear me singin' through these tears  
  
Time is a jet plane, it moves too fast  
Oh, but what is the use of changing if all we've shared can't last  
I can change, I swear  
Oh see what you can do  
  
I can make it through  
You can make it too  
Love is so simple, to quote a phrase  
You've known it all the time, I'm learnin' it these days  
  
Oh, I know I can find you  
Oh in somebody's room  
It's a price I have to pay  
You're a big girl all the way  
  
A change in the weather is known to be extreme  
What's the use of changing horses in midstream  
I'm going out of my mind  
Oh with a pain that stops and starts  
  
Like a corkscrew to my heart  
Ever since we've been apart
