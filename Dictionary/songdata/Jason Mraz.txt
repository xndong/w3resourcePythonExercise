93 million miles from the sun  
People get ready, get ready  
'Cause here it comes, it's a light  
A beautiful light, over the horizon  
Into our eyes  
Oh, my my how beautiful  
Oh my beautiful mother  
She told me, son in life you're gonna go far  
If you do it right, you'll love where you are  
Just know, wherever you go  
You can always come home  
  
240 thousand miles from the moon  
We've come a long way to belong here  
To share this view of the night  
A glorious night  
Over the horizon is another bright sky  
Oh my my how beautiful, oh my irrefutable father  
He told me, son sometimes it may seem dark  
But the absence of the light is a necessary part  
Just know, you're never alone, you can always come back home  
  
Oh, oh  
  
You can always come back  
  
Every road is a slippery slope  
But there is always a hand that you can hold on to  
Looking deeper through the telescope  
You can see that your home's inside of you  
  
Just know, that wherever you go  
No you're never alone  
You will always get back home  
  
Oh, oh  
Oh, oh  
Oh  
  
93 million miles from the sun  
People get ready, get ready  
'Cause here it comes, it's a light  
A beautiful light, over the horizon  
Into our eyes

You've got the best of both worlds  
You're the kind of girl who can take down a man,  
And lift him back up again  
You are strong but you're needy,  
Humble but you're greedy  
Based on your body language  
And Shoddy cursive I've been reading  
Your style is quite selective,  
Though your mind is rather reckless  
Well I guess it just suggests  
That this is just what happiness is  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
It's like picking up trash in dresses  
  
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you write  
Kind of turn themselves into knives  
And don't mind my nerve you could call it fiction  
But I like being submerged in your contradictions dear  
Cause here we are, here we are  
  
Although you are biased I love your advice  
Your comebacks they're quick  
And probably have to do with your insecurities  
There's no shame in being crazy,  
Depending on how you take these  
Words I'm paraphrasing this relationship we're staging  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
It's like picking up trash in dresses  
  
Well it kind of hurts when the kind of words you say  
Kind of turn themselves into blades  
Kind and courteous is the life I've heard  
But it's nice to say that we played in the dirt  
Cause here, here we are, Here we are  
  
[X7]  
(Here we are)  
  
We're still here  
  
[Chorus]  
And what a beautiful mess this is  
It's like taking a guess when the only answer is yes  
  
And through timeless words and priceless pictures  
We'll fly like birds, not of this earth  
And tides they turn and hearts disfigure  
But that's no concern when we're wounded together  
And we've torn our dresses and stained our shirts  
But it's nice today, oh the wait was so worth it

Let's hit the road and throw out the map  
Wherever we go, we won't look back  
Cause we're going places and we're going there fast  
And let's move to Paris and get ourselves a loft  
Let's live in squalor, and spend all cost  
Let's throw caution to the wind and start over again  
  
Think how many doors we'll open  
Just as many stars are shining  
Who knows where we're going  
Yeah who knows what we'll find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
Let's hike in the mountains and challenge our will  
Let's leap over canyons and get lost in the hills  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
Think how many doors we'll open  
Just as many stars are sure to shine  
Who knows where we're going  
And who knows what we'll find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
  
All of our plans will be at sea  
The sum of all our failures, they cannot hurt us now  
Let's hoist up ourselves  
And shove off to China and climb up a wall  
We'll keep on climbing, looking over it all  
Laughing it up, yeah having a ball  
  
Think how many doors we'll open  
Just as many stars are going to shine  
Who knows where we're going  
And who knows what we'll find  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you  
I want to see the world the way I see a world with you

So thank you guys so much for comin' around, stickin' around.  
Some of you who came to both shows, that's really cool.  
  
Well you see at last  
My love well she's come along  
And my lonely days well they're finally over  
And my life is like a song  
At la-ya-ya-ya-ya-yast, at la-a-a-a-ast, oh at last, at last, oh  
  
Oh, this night above, well it looks like all of you  
But you know, my heart is always wrapped up in Toca  
(audience laughing)  
(Jason: Ha ha)  
Oh, the way he plays the fool-oo-oo  
Well well - do do do do do  
  
Oh, did you bring your french horn tonight with you Mr. T  
(yeah I brought the french horn)  
French me with your horny, horny, horny, horny, horn  
  
Woah-ooo-ooo  
Wah-ah ah  
Woah-ooo-ooo  
Wah  
  
You know he plays the low notes, but he sings the high notes.  
Again this is Mr. Ian Sheridan our friend.  
  
You know what that sounds like?  
Sounds like - love, (laughing) life's sweetest reward  
It's an open sword  
  
(Toca: sword?)  
  
Hey love, exciting and new (laughing)  
Come aboard, we're expecting you  
On the loooove boat (applause)  
Soon we'll be making another run  
On the loooove boat oh-oh-oh  
I'm lookin' to dock my boat - oh  
  
(one, two)

Whenever my head starts to hurt  
Before it goes from bad to feeling worst  
I turn off my phone, I get down low  
And I put my hands in the dirt  
I try to stop the world from moving so fast  
Tryna get a grip on where I'm at  
To simplify this daisy life,  
And get my feet in the grass  
  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
  
The only explanation for our rise,  
Must be that everybody wants to get it high  
And move on up to a deluxe apartment in the sky  
Well, the higher we go, the taller we grow  
We lose sight of our land below  
When you can have your place up in outer space  
'Cause my home is where my food is grown  
  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
  
We are animals  
(We are animals)  
We are wild  
(We are wild)  
Starting with emotions at the bottom of the ocean  
Now we're swinging from the tops of the trees  
Oh, we are animals  
(We are animals)  
We are wild  
(We are wild)  
And we'll truly be forgiven when we start getting back,  
To living with the land in harmony  
  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
Two more times around!  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
  
One more time around the World  
  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
Du du du tu tu tu  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back to work  
I'm going back to the Earth  
I'm going back!

Okay go, go hang your heart on any tree,  
You can make yourself available to anybody,  
'Cause every livin' person knows you are a prize,  
Whichever way you go I'll be easy to find,  
I don't ask for much, just be honest with me  
I don't ask for much, be honest  
  
Think of this song as a promise you can do what you want,  
If you decide you wanna move into a new stage,  
Deleting me from pages in your mission statement,  
My love is unconditional, make no mistake,  
I don't ask for much, just be honest with me,  
I don't ask for much, just be honest with me,  
  
Who we are when love is what it wants to be,  
We are free, and we are having the best day ever by far,  
Being treated to the light like a superstar  
  
I can hold space while you see what your heart has to say about me,  
There's no dotted line to sign away your freedom,  
I'll acknowledge you for what you do to keep strong,  
I'll always get behind you, don't get me wrong,  
I don't ask for much, just be honest with me  
I don't ask for much, just be honest with me  
I don't ask for much, just be honest with me  
  
Who we are when love is what it wants to be,  
We are free and, we are having the best day ever by far, yes we are

Mystery the moon  
A hole in the sky  
A supernatural nightlight  
So full but often right  
A pair of eyes a closin' one  
A chosen child of golden sun  
A marble dog that chases cars  
To farthest reaches of the beach and far beyond into the swimming sea of stars  
  
A cosmic fish they love to kiss  
They're giving birth to constellation  
No riffs and oh no reservation  
If they should fall you get a wish or dedication  
May I suggest you get the best  
For nothing less than you and I  
Let's take a chance as this romance is rising over before we lose the lighting  
Oh bella bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna  
Oh bella do you do  
Do do do do do  
  
You are an illuminated anchor  
Of leads to infinite number  
Crashing waves and breaking thunder  
Tiding the evenflows of hunger  
You're dancing naked there for me  
You expose all memory  
You make the most of boundary  
You're the ghost of royalty imposing love  
You are the queen and king combining everything  
Into twining like a ring around the finger of a girl  
I'm just a singer, you're the world  
All I can bring ya  
Is the language of a lover  
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon  
How you swoon me like no other  
  
May I suggest you get the best  
Of your wish may I insist  
That no contest for little you or smaller I  
A larger chance happened, all them they lie  
On the rise, on the brink of our lives  
Bella please  
Bella you beautiful luna  
Oh bella do you do  
Bella luna, my beautiful, beautiful moon  
How you swoon me like no other, oh oh oh

Love is where this begins  
Thank you for letting me in  
I've never had to pretend  
You've always known who I am  
And I know my life is better  
Because you're a part of it  
I know without you by my side  
That I would be different  
  
Thank you for all of your trust  
Thank you for not giving up  
Thank you for holding my hand  
I've always known where you stand  
Yes I feel my life is better  
So is the world we're living in  
I'm thankful for the time I spent  
  
With my best friend  
  
Thank you for calling me out  
Thank you for waking me up  
Thank you for breaking it down  
Thank you for choosing us  
Thank you for all you're about  
Thank you for lifting me up  
Thank you for keeping me grounded  
And being here now  
  
My life is better,  
Because you're a part of it  
I know without you by my side  
That I would be different  
Yes I feel my life is better  
And so is the world we're livin' in  
I'm thankful for the time I spent  
With my best friend  
  
You're my best friend.

I know exactly how you feel  
You were this close to closing deals  
When everything fell from out your hands  
You were forced to decide on other plans now  
You figured it best to just ignore it  
Otherwise you're only living for it  
And if anyone ever wondered why you did it  
You'd swear they never knew you sold your soul to the  
Burning, burning, burning, burning bridges  
  
You know exactly what I want so  
I don't have to be so damn upfront  
No matter the moment we decide to make our minds up  
I know a man who may need a new assignment  
To hand in his heart and take his last vacation  
Attempting to spoil imagination  
If anyone ever wonders where he went  
I wouldn't say that he spent his time driving over  
Burning, burning, burning bridges  
  
Burning, burning which is  
Nothing more than a longing for being uninvolved  
Uninvolved  
Uninvolved  
Uninvolved  
  
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks  
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks  
Oh, desire can cause heart attacks  
Oh, desire, it won't bring you back

I'm taking a moment just imaginin' that I'm dancin' with you  
I'm your pole and all you're wearing is your shoes  
You got soul, you know what to do to turn me on until I write a song about you  
And you have your own engaging style  
And you've got the knack to vivify  
And you make my slacks a little tight, you may unfasten them if you like  
That's if you crash and spend the night  
  
But you don't fold, you don't fade  
You've got everything you need, especially me  
Sister you've got it all  
You make the call to make my day  
In your message say my name  
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all  
  
Curl your upper lip up and let me look around  
Ride your tongue along your bottom lip and bite down  
And bend your back and ask those hips if I can touch  
Because they're the perfect jumping off point of getting closer to your  
  
Butterfly  
Well you float on by  
Oh kiss me with your eyelashes tonight  
Or Eskimo your nose real close to mine  
And let's mood the lights and finally make it right  
But you don't fold, you don't fade, you've got everything you need  
Especially me  
Sister you've got it all  
  
You make the call to make my day  
In you message say my name  
Your talk is all the talk sister you've got it all  
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all  
  
You make the call to make my day  
In you message say my name  
Your talk is all the talk sister you've got it all  
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all  
  
You've got it all, you've got it all  
  
Doll I need to see you pull your knee socks up  
Let me feel you up side, down slide, in slide, out slide, over here  
Climb in my mouth now child  
  
Butterfly, well you landed on my mind  
Damn right you landed on my ear and then you crawled inside  
Now I see you perfectly behind closed eyes  
I wanna fly with you and I don't wanna lie to you  
'Cause I, 'cause I can't recall a better days  
I'm coming to shine on the occasion  
  
You're an open minded lady  
You've got it all  
And I never forget a face  
If I'm making my own  
I have my days  
Let's face the fact here, it's you that's got it all  
  
You know that fortune favors the brave  
Well let me get paid while I make you breakfast  
The rest is up to you, you make the call  
  
You make the call to make my day  
In your message say my name  
Your talk is all the talk, sister you've got it all  
  
'Cause I can't recall a better day  
I'm coming to shine on the occasion  
You?re a sophisticated lady, oh you've got it all  
  
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all  
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all  
You've got it all, you've got it all, you've got it all  
  
You've got it all, you've got it all  
  
Butterfly, baby, well you've got it all

I remember when we used to walk together  
Used to talk together, go to the park together  
In all kinds of weather we would share  
This common pleasure with most of human kinds  
It was a kind of treasure One that I was surely glad to find  
But I got one right here and I'm okay  
I'm okay, and you're okay, and we're okay  
I'm alright. Everything else is alright sometimes.  
  
Just remember those bones they get broken  
And love is not a token of affection  
It's not even a real thing, it's a word  
So don't you try to but it out with a ring  
Cause it's a verb, to love someone  
Open up and let them in  
Just don't be afraid to set them free again  
  
This ain't no heaven, ain't no hell , ain't no in between  
Cause there's just too many faces and places in this world  
That I ain't ever seen  
I'm gonna keep on keeping on  
I'm gonna reap on being strong  
I got my head on, though misconnected  
It's alright cause I do it protected  
I got a day job. I drive a cheap ride  
Sounds like I'm gonna fine  
You only get one life to learn  
There's only so many brain cells that you can burn  
And life can take a turn and take away that you've earned  
And leave you yearning for more, so much more  
Life is gonna leave you yearning for more, more, more  
Your stomach's gonna be churning  
Wanting more, you're wanting, wanting some more.  
You're wanting some more, more, more  
Do you want some?  
  
Well I got some right here and I'm okay  
I'm okay and you're okay  
Ha ha, we're okay  
Everything else will be fine sometimes.  
Guess what I'm doing okay.

Sipping coffee at a quarter to two  
I wake up and I'm dallin' and my minds running to you  
No wonder I'm a one woman man  
She keeps me hot in a jar on the nightstand  
I should tell her that she couldn't be more  
Opposite then a foot in a door,  
There's no one else I would rather go out with, thats hell when I see them
standing there  
Me and my mouth we don't mean to be rushing  
We talk about deep freely cause we crushing  
I want to shake both sides of the brush ya  
Theatrically I say we rock it  
  
And when the coyotes, they sing in the park  
It's when the city lights start fallin' for the sea  
While them roads are windin' down  
And the flying men'll hit the ground  
Every motion is close to the touch  
And the coyotes sing when they call on your lovin'  
  
Coming back for more,  
You know I'm coming for you  
You know we should be should be together  
While we rock, we won't put a stop  
Not today not tomorrow.  
You better lock your doors  
You know why, cause we want you  
'Cause when I kill a liar  
  
I wish the world was a live like you.  
I wish the world would help me through  
Another repetuity to approach you  
Another telepathic rendezvous  
I wish you would walk when your jogging  
You got a duty to sell in Mexico  
I got to try to keep you acting shady  
I don't like liking you when you walk because  
I gotta figure out the snooze alarm  
I want'a lay in a place till dawn  
I want'a play in the park come on  
Now let me see ya alarm in the lesh hello  
  
And when the coyotes escape to New York  
Then the city lights has crumbles to the sea  
And the girls turned it into lost and found  
The flying metal hit the ground  
Every motion is closer to touching the coyotes singing  
I'm a coyote and I got a taste for your loving  
  
You know I will come for you  
You know we should be, we should be together,  
Because once we work we want to stop  
Not today or tomorrow  
  
Because once we work we want to stop  
Not today or tomorrow  
  
You know I will come for you  
You know we should be, we should be together,  
Because once we work we want to stop  
Not today or tomorrow

I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket  
  
You see it started way back in NYC  
When I stole my first rhyme from the M.I.C.  
At a west end avenue at 63  
The beginning of a leap year, February, '96  
With a guitar picked up in the mix  
I committed to the licks like a nickel back of tricks  
Well look at me now  
Look at me now  
Look at me now, now, now, now  
  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket  
  
Well you're never gonna guess  
Where I've been been been  
And I have no regrets  
That I bet my whole checking account  
Because it all amounts to nothing up in the end  
  
Well you can only count on the road again  
We'll soon be on the radio dial  
And I been payin' close attention to the Willie Nelson style  
Like a band of gypsies on the highway while  
I'm one man pushin' on the California skyline drive  
Up the coast mc brag the most  
I'm pickin up my pace and makin' time like space ghost  
  
Raising a toast to the highway patrol with the most  
Put my cruise control on coast  
'cause I'm tourin' around the nation on extended vacation see  
I got Elsa the dog who exceeds my limitation  
I say, "I like your style, crazy pound pup!  
You need a ride?  
Well come on, girl, hop in the truck!"  
  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket to come on  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
With my hand in my pocket  
And I'm waiting for my rocket  
  
See I'm a down home brother, redneck undercover  
With my guitar here  
I'm ready to play  
And I'm s a sucker for a filly  
Got a natural ability to give the freestyle  
Look at my flexibility  
Dangerous at the mike  
My ghetto hat's cocked right  
The ladies say, "yo, that kid is crazy"  
The backstage betties taking more than they can get  
They say, "what's up with m-are-a-z?"  
  
Hey, hey, something's different in my world today  
Well they changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow  
Hey, hey, something's different in my world today  
They changed my traffic sign to a brighter yellow  
I'm just a curbside prophet  
  
Curbside prophet now  
Curbside prophet now  
Curbside  
Come on, now  
Curbside prophet  
Waiting for my rocket to come

Calm down  
Deep breaths  
And get yourself dressed instead  
Of running around  
And pulling all your threads saying  
Breaking yourself up  
  
If it's a broken part, replace it  
But, if it's a broken arm then brace it  
If it's a broken heart then face it  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And everything will be fine  
Everything will be fine  
Hmm  
  
Hang on  
Help is on the way  
Stay strong  
I'm doing everything  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And hold your own  
Know your name  
And go your own way  
  
And everything, everything will be fine  
Everything  
  
Are the details in the fabric  
Are the things that make you panic  
Are your thoughts results of static cling?  
  
Are the things that make you blow  
Hell, no reason, go on and scream  
If you're shocked it's just the fault  
Of faulty manufacturing.  
  
Yeah everything will be fine  
Everything in no time at all  
Everything  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)  
Are the things that make you panic  
Are your thoughts results of static cling? (Go your own way)  
  
Are the details in the fabric (Hold your own, know your name)  
Are the things that make you panic (Go your own way)  
Is it Mother Nature's sewing machine?  
  
Are the things that make you blow (Hold your own, know your name)  
Hell no reason go on and scream  
If you're shocked it's just the fault (Go your own way)  
Of faulty manufacturing  
  
Everything will be fine  
Everything in no time at all  
Hearts will hold

Did you get my message, the one I left  
While I was trying to convince everything  
That I meant in a minute or less when I called to confess  
And make all of my stresses go bye-bye  
  
Did you get my message, you did not guess  
'Cause if you did you would have called me with your sweet intent  
And we could give it a rest  
'stead of beating my breast  
Making all of the pressure go sky-high  
  
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send  
Do they bend, do they break from the flight that they take  
And come back together again with a whole new meaning  
In a brand new sense, completely unrelated to the one I sent  
  
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message, yeah, oooh oooh ooooh hooo  
  
Uh oh, where did it go, must have bopped past your phone  
And fallen right outta the window  
  
Ooh well, how can I tell?  
Shoulda called the operator maybe she know the info  
But whether or not my message you got was too much or a lot to reply  
  
Why not try this for a fact  
Should you ever come back I'd relax and feel relieved  
Before my panic attack  
  
Ahh hooo oooh  
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo  
  
Did you get my message, the one that I left  
While I was trying to convince everything that I meant  
  
Now the moment is passed  
Not much sand in the glass and I'm standing to lose my mind  
Do you ever wonder what happens to the words that we send  
So they bend, do they break from the flight that they take  
And come back together again with a whole new meaning  
to the matter of our love defense and please be sympathetice to the time I
spent  
  
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message, oooh oooh ooooh  
Did you get my message, yeah oooh oooh ooooh hooo  
Did you get my message  
  
No I didn't hear a word you said  
Did you get my message  
  
No I'm not gonna believe your lies anymore  
Did you get my message that I want to reconnect with you  
Did you get my message  
  
I can hear you say your coming but I don't hear  
Why did you get the message love ?  
That I want to get back with you  
Did you get my message love  
  
That I want to reconnect with you  
Why did you get the message love ?  
Did you get my message  
  
That I want to reconnect with you

Who is he, Mr. Rand McNally?  
I had I dream that mystery was me. Now who else could I be?  
  
I dreamed I went to England and met the spice girls there for tea  
They lost one more they're down from four to my favorite number three  
But they're still quite spicy as the orange flavor  
And oh so nice to do me the favor and lick my icing under the table now  
But I gotta leave town mr. Nally, just as scary spice was about to go down on
me  
And don't ask how mr. Nally and give up the towel mr. Nally and run.  
  
I dreamed I went to Singapore got bored and robbed a liquor store  
What for? Nobody knows I only took a couple of Marlboros  
Oh but that was all they needed and the criminal was soon defeated  
And now in jail I'm waiting for my punishment of caining  
So I gotta think fast mr nally watch your ass, wake up and laugh and run  
  
Better Mr run, mr rand, mr mac, mr nally  
Mr run, mr man, you got the knack for the rally And run.  
  
I had a chance to visit the north pole but it was way too cold to smoke  
Oh my nose was freezing I should could use some coughing and wheezing  
So I tried it anyway and the place went up in flames  
How was I suppose to know you could catch fire to the snow  
Oh lord way to go mr nally, way to go, now you're melting the poles mr nally
so run.  
  
I jumped ship in NYC and headed south to Washington DC  
Didn't think I'd go there but played some shows there fancy lucky me  
But it is really slow there with our new president on TV  
Too many politicians and liberal Christians they're all set out for me  
Singing cast your vote mr nally, castrate your vote, no you don't, just run  
  
I thumbed a ride across the prairie, I got hitched in Vegas, yep, I got
married  
To a lady who loved me she thought it's be funny to gamble all my money  
And I got stranded without my clothes, a little bit of fear and loathing heart
attack  
I got chased by the rat pack once in a flashback. Singing viva Las Vegas.  
  
I settled down in San Diego and smoked a joint with java joe  
And with a grin he took me in spilling coffee on his chin  
And I played my show there and I met my bros there  
And with my throw pillow they kindly let me make my bed there  
There's one more thing before I go there's never been any place like this home  
  
For once in a lifetime maybe I'd be foolish not to stay

Keep your eyes open as if  
Love could come a walkin as if  
Everything else is meaningless, meaningless  
And that's the way it oughta be  
Mysteries, especially she  
Oh everything else  
Is almost meaningless, meaningless  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my name  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my name  
  
Keep your eyes open as if  
Everyone's a poet as if  
Everything else is meaningless, meaningless  
And that's the way it oughta be, yea  
Mysteries, including me  
Oh well everything else  
Is almost meaningless, meaningless  
Oh yea, oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my name  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my name  
  
To be a little bit advanced  
You gotta take a little bit of a second chance  
On life  
You gotta get on up and dance  
You better throw all your precious plans  
Better wave them goodbye  
A buh bye, buh bye, bye bye bye  
Ya gotta keep your eyes open  
As if everything else is just along  
Come along on it's way  
And that's the way it oughta be  
Well mysteries in everything  
Well I say, I say  
Well I, i will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my name  
Oh say  
Well I will always feel that way  
And if a time a change should come  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my  
You'd remember my name  
  
Lyrics by jason mraz

Said I'm fallin all over the world  
Said I'm fallin  
This love affair,  
It isn't all there but it's everywhere  
Said I'm fallin all over, fallin over and over  
But the blue shy, oh blue soul  
And love with the tole it's taken  
A true crime is the perfect role  
I love every more that I take in  
So much that I'd do it again, I'd do it again  
Said I'm fallin all over the world  
It's a breath of air, so rare  
Thick as thunder  
Said I'm fallin all over,  
Every wonder so, full of wonder, so beautiful  
There's magic up above  
Every cliche I learn to love  
But as long as these birds have wings  
Then I'll have songs, and I'll have words to sing  
Sing of fallin over, I'm fallin over the whole damn thing  
Said I'm fallin all over the world  
Said I'm fallin

Fly me to the moon  
And let me play amoung the stars  
And let me know what love is like  
On Jupiter and Mars  
  
In other words hold my hand  
In other words, Darling kiss me  
  
And fill my heart with joy  
And let me sing forever more  
'Cause you are all I've wanted,  
All I've worshipped and all I've adored  
  
In other words please be true  
In other words, In other words  
  
In other words, I love you  
  
And fill my heart with joy  
And let me sing forever more  
'Cause you are all I've wanted,  
All I've worshipped and all I've adored  
  
In other words please be true  
In other words, In other words  
In other words, I love you  
  
... Something like that

Well I heard that it might be raining bed sheets and lover's words  
Let's throw out the hotel comforter and hang the 'do not disturb'  
Sign me up for the storm  
I'll wear my suit for the shower  
'Cause I'll have you to keep me warm in the coldest hour  
  
And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
Well every kiss, every hug is so light on that touch, delicate like a
snowflake  
Well I can taste, I can taste, I can taste, I can taste you all over my face  
And everyone might find it foolish to not be counting on the sun  
But your mouth is my umbrella now  
Because I'm holding your tongue  
  
And when the darkness falls under your hair, there I'll be  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
There's a good chance in hell  
Like cats and dogs we'll be flying  
And I'm no weatherman  
But you are lightning, striking  
  
Here comes the sun, and the rain  
All at once down the sink  
  
In the midst of the morning pull up a blanket of a cloud  
And await for the warning of another come down  
Because the water is healthy for the roses in your cheeks  
My well holds plenty for penny wishin' in your deep end  
And when the lights go out, no doubt, with you I'll be  
  
And crazy is the forecast all week  
  
And if them rains should fall for sure with you I'll be  
Ah because crazy is the forecast all week long  
Crazy is the forecast

I picture something, it's beautiful  
It's full of life, and it is all blue  
I see the sunset on the beach, yeah  
It makes me feel calm  
When I'm calm, I feel good  
  
And when I feel good, I sing  
And the joy it brings makes me feel good  
And when I feel good, I sing  
Of the joy it brings  
  
I see birds fly across the sky  
Everyone's heart flies together  
Food is frying and people smiling  
Like there is no other way to feel good  
  
And when I feel good, I sing  
And the joy it brings makes me feel good  
And when I feel good, I sing  
Of the joy it brings  
  
I say come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
Come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
I say come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
Come on along  
I know you really wanna feel our song  
We've got some life to bring  
We've got some joy in this thing  
  
Can you feel  
Can you feel  
Can you feel  
The joy that it brings  
If you can feel the joy then you should let yourself sing  
Hey  
I love to share my things  
  
'Cause it brings me freedom  
Got to get you some of that freedom  
It's a smile you can feel in your heart beat  
  
Singing freedom  
You deserve your freedom  
It's in the feeling that beauty  
  
Freedom  
Well it's all for you  
All for you  
All for you  
All for you  
  
Freedom  
Got to get you some of that  
Got to get you some of that  
Got to get you some of that  
Freedom

Well the future boy where are you from  
My time machine crashed over yonder  
Syphillis is a bitch but contracting hiv is much worse  
Why are you pushing info into me  
I have no need for it  
I'm from the stars  
  
Well I thought you'd like to know your scoop  
I'm taking babies back with me, yeah  
I'm taking them back home  
So they can see there's a much better place  
  
I've got a sister with an open mind  
And my friends are all junkies  
But there still my friends  
  
Well as long as they don't use monkeys  
We enjoy the heat, the stolen days in this winter of thosand three  
  
Well the future boy said I've got friends  
But you know sometimes it all depends  
On how tall they are, against yourself  
  
Well I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
I am the future boy  
Find your way home  
  
Well my friends have all gone and left me  
So I decided to come here and see  
Myself as a baby  
But it looks like I'm stuck here this time  
Oh shit  
I'm gonna miss my friends  
But I know you're still the future boy  
Yes I'm still the future boy  
I'm gonna build you a time machine to get back home  
You're still the future boy  
Still the future boy  
Still the future boy  
Well I'm still the future boy  
Oh, this whole damn world is your toy boy  
So get back on tour boy  
And find your way home

Well here I am, I'm sitting alone again  
I'm staring up at the sky  
Which at this lonely moment is my only friend  
And suddenly as I gazed upon the night  
Well I notice the stars  
They began to shake and dance and burst  
And fall into the darkness  
They exploded down, I knew what I had to do  
I ran up to the top of the hill  
And I took a hold for you  
You were the sweetest star that fell  
And yes, I held onto it close to the numbness in my heart  
And then I kissed a star, yes I did  
I wrapped it up inside of a golden bow  
And then I ran away just to find you  
'Cause this was your gift, your gift, oh shit  
A star that I kissed  
Oh the galaxy that lives inside your eyes  
Was in need, I said it was in need  
Of a, of a brand new shining light  
I said I wished to the dark sky above  
That all I had was to be captured  
And willingly turned over to you  
I know you better now and at this I smile  
I simply gave to you the symbol of what you are to me  
You are the star that shines  
And explodes with light and I love and embrace  
Love and embrace all that I can  
You better take this blindness and stay away from me  
And let me bask inside of your golden seam  
I never knew such simple astronomy  
I never knew it could come to me and not by the ways of the heart  
And call on me to be one of those strangely dressed wise men  
Who follow the stars to their love  
You are such a perfect star to wish upon  
Well I love you and God and I'm hopeful  
Of what this lonely night may lead me to  
So I said god I'm hopeful  
Of what this lonely, lonely night  
Will lead me tonight  
Oh well, well I'm hopeful that this lonely night  
Well it shines so right, I'm hopeful  
I'm hopeful of all good things to come about  
I'm wishing upon you now, yeah, I'm wishing upon you now  
Free me and let me indulge my view  
Oh, most beautiful you keeper of starlight  
Take on me, oh, oh, oh well here I am  
I'm sitting all by myself again  
I stare up at the sky  
Which at this moment is my only friend  
Say well, suddenly as I gazed upon the night  
Well I notice the stars  
They began to shake and burst  
Oh, it looks like they want to fight, no  
They were dancing, they were romancing  
Oh, they were falling in love  
They falling in love all over  
Falling in love all over  
Falling in love, falling in love, falling in love  
I say falling in love, falling in love all over  
Falling in love, is my best friend  
Falling in love all over, all over again  

Well let the geek in the pink take a stab at it  
If you like the way I'm thinkin' baby wink at it  
I may be skinny at times but I'm fat full 'a rhymes  
Pass me the mic and I'm a grab at it a  
Isn't it delicious crazy way that I'm kissin'  
Cause baby listen to this don't want to miss it while it's hittin'  
Sometimes you gotta fit in to get in  
But don't ever quit so soon I'm gonna let you win but see  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You can vibe without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby I could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldn't be a let down  
But sugar don't forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
We could be the talk across the town  
Don't judge me by the color, confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I'm the geek in the pink pink pink  
I'm the geek in the pink yeah  
  
Well this relationship fodder don't mean to bother nobody  
But cupid's automatic musta fired multiple shots at her  
Because she fall in love too often that's what the matter  
At least I talk about it keep a pattern of flattery and a  
She was staring through the doorframe  
Eyeing me down like already a bad boyfriend  
Well she can get her toys outta the drawer then  
Cause I ain't comin' home, I don't need that attention, see  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You'll get by without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby we could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it shouldn't be the let down  
But sugar don't forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
You could be the talk across the town  
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I am more than you're thinking  
Hey look at me go  
From hero to zero  
Oh take it from a geek like me  
I can save you from unoriginal dumb-dums  
Who wouldn't care if you com...plete him or not  
  
So what I've got a short attention span  
A coke in my hand  
Because I'd rather have the afternoon, relax and understand  
Mm hip hop and flip flops it don't stop with the light rock  
A shot to mock you kinda puts me in the tight spot  
The hype is nothing more than hoo-hah so I'm  
Developing a language and I'm calling it my own  
So take a peek into the speaker and you'll see what I mean  
That on the other side the grass is greener  
  
I don't care what you might think about me  
You'll get by without me if you want  
I could be the one to take you home  
Baby we could rock the night alone  
If we never get down it wouldn't be the let down  
But sugar don't forget what you already know  
I could be the one to turn you out  
We could be the talk across the town  
Don't judge it by the color, confuse it for another  
You might regret what you let slip away  
  
I'm the geek in the pink pink pink  
I'm the geek in the pink yeah

All y'all it's the new color for fall

Moving forward using all my breath  
Making love to you was never second best  
I saw the world thrashing all around your face  
Never really knowing it was always mesh and lace  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
You've seen the difference and  
It's getting better all the time  
There's nothing you and I won't do  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
(You should know better)  
Dream of better lives the kind which never hate  
(You should see why)  
Dropped in the state of imaginary grace  
(You should know better)  
I made a pilgrimage to save this human race  
(You should see why)  
Never comprehending a race that long gone by  
(I'll stop the world)  
I'll stop the world and melt with you  
(I'll stop the world)  
You've seen the difference and it's getting better all the time  
(Let's stop the world)  
There's nothing you and I won't do

I'll stop the world and melt with you  
The future's open wide

I'll stop the world and melt with you  
(Let's stop the world)  
I've seen some changes but it's getting better all the time

Tell me a secret, tell me anything  
What's your weapon? What's your middle name?  
What do you believe in? What's your animal?  
Are you a cat or a dog person?  
What's your outlook? What's your favourite saying?  
  
Hey, maybe you laugh, maybe you laugh a lot  
Maybe you started, but you somehow quit the part  
And you may be a hippie and a democrat,  
Yeah I remember that, I think  
And you might like wine, but you're not the type who likes to drink  
  
What made me, forget everything I know?  
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics, winding to my mind  
So I would like another look inside you,  
Yeah I would love the chance to love you, like I'd never known you  
  
Yeah, maybe you're sleeping on a telephone.  
And maybe you're dreaming of an anglophone with a crooked smile  
And maybe your profile, boasts a brand new nose  
And maybe your new job, it requires that you cannot wear any clothes.  
  
What made me, forget everything I know?  
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics, wired into my mind  
So I would like another look inside you,  
Yeah I would love the chance to love you, like I've never known you  
  
After all, I have fallen  
  
Maybe your favourite colour is brown,  
And maybe your crying and you're not sure why  
Maybe you're living in a whole new town  
And maybe you're back with your old boyfriend and you're busy going down.  
  
What made me, forget everything?  
All my beliefs, are my memories  
All the episodes of you, especially the ones that hurt  
And even the few that made me laugh  
Well I can't get them back,  
That's why I'm asking for some more of you now  
Yes I would love the chance to love you  
And I would love to love you!  
  
What made me, forget everything I know?  
All my beliefs, replaced by scenarios  
Of unintelligent life, echoing in stereo  
On invisible mics, wired into my mind  
So I would like another look inside you,  
Yes I would love the chance to love you, I would love to love you  
  
Yes I would love the chance to love you  
Like I'd never known you

When I look into your eyes  
It's like watching the night sky  
Or a beautiful sunrise  
There's so much they hold  
And just like them old stars  
I see that you've come so far  
To be right where you are  
How old is your soul?  
  
I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough  
I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up  
  
And when you're needing your space, to do some navigating  
I'll be here patiently waiting, to see what you find  
  
'Cause even the stars they burn  
Some even fall to the earth  
We've got a lot to learn  
God knows we're worth it  
No, I won't give up  
  
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily  
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make  
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use  
The tools and gifts we got yeah, we got a lot at stake  
And in the end, you're still my friend at least we did intend  
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn  
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in  
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not and who I am  
  
I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough  
I'm giving you all my love  
I'm still looking up, still looking up.  
  
I won't give up on us (no I'm not giving up)  
God knows I'm tough enough (I am tough, I am loved)  
We've got a lot to learn (we're alive, we are loved)  
God knows we're worth it (and we're worth it)  
  
I won't give up on us, even if the skies get rough  
I'm giving you all my love, I'm still looking up

Go make your next choice be your best choice  
And if you're looking for a boy with a voice, well baby I'm single  
Are you in the mood for some dude, are you in the mood to be subdued  
Or would you rather just mingle?  
Let's get set then to go then and let us jet set we'll be like the jetsons  
You can be Jane my wife. Should I marry Jane tonight?  
  
I would if I could. I'd do most anything spontaneously.  
  
Or we can keep chilling like ice cream filling  
We can cool in the gang if you'd rather hang  
Ain't no thing. I can be lacubrious with you.  
I got no ifs ands ors no wits or what's about it  
But this place is getting crowded and my house is two blocks away  
Or maybe closer  
  
I would if I could. I'd do most anything spontaneously.  
You know I would, if I could. I'll do anything spontaneously.  
  
If you could be nimble, you'd have it simple just like me.  
So go on and try it, do not deny yourself your freedom.  
  
So step on up to the plate get a date with mraz  
See you better act fast because supplies they never  
Now did you know this is limited time offer  
So go make your mind up before our times up  
You better start winding it up because the party's almost over  
(and if you should know girl, go a little bit lower now)  
  
See how I would, if I could. I'd do most anything spontaneously.  
You know I would, and I can prove it. I'll do anything spontaneously.

I try to picture a girl  
Through a looking glass  
See her as a carbon atom  
See her eyes and stare back at them  
See that girl  
As her own new world  
Though a home is on the surface, she is still a universe  
  
Glory God, oh God is peeking through the blinds  
Are we all here standing naked  
Taking guesses at the actual date and time  
Oh my, justifying reasons why  
Is an absolutely insane resolution to live by  
  
Live high  
Live mighty  
Live righteously  
Takin' it easy  
Live high, live mighty  
Live righteously  
  
Try to picture the man  
To always have an open hand  
See him as a giving tree  
See him as matter  
Matter fact he's not a beast  
No not the devil either  
Always a good deed doer  
And it's laughter that we're makin' after all  
  
The call of the wild is still an ordination why  
And the order of the permeates  
All our politics are too late  
Oh my, the congregation in my mind  
Is this assembly singing gratitude  
Practicing their livin' for you  
  
Just take it easy  
And celebrate the malleable reality  
Nothing is ever as it seems  
This life is but a dream

If this life is one act  
Why do we lay all these traps  
We put them right in our path  
When we just wanna be free  
  
I will not waste my days  
Making up all kinds of ways  
To worry about all the things  
That will not happen to me  
  
So I just let go of what I know I don't know  
And I know I only do this by  
Living in the moment  
Living my life  
Easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
With peace in my heart  
Peace in my soul  
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home  
Living in the moment  
  
I'm letting myself off the hook for things I've done  
I let my past go past  
And now I'm having more fun  
I'm letting go of the thoughts  
That do not make me strong  
And I believe this way can be the same for everyone  
  
And if I fall asleep  
I know you'll be the one who'll always remind me  
To live in the moment  
To live in my life  
Easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
Got peace in my soul  
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home  
  
I can't walk through life facing backwards  
I have tried  
I tried more than once to just make sure  
And I was denied the future I'd been searching for  
But I spun around and hurt no more  
By living in the moment  
Living my life  
Easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
Got peace in my soul  
Wherever I'm going, I'm already home  
  
I'm living in the moment  
I'm living my life  
Just taking it easy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
I got peace in my soul  
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home  
I'm living in the moment  
I'm living my life  
Oh, easy and breezy  
With peace in my mind  
I got peace in my heart  
I got peace in my soul  
Oh, wherever I'm going, I'm already home  
I'm living in the moment

Long drive, long night  
The best night of my life  
With you ridin'  
Your hand on my hand  
  
The thought of arriving  
Kinda feels like dying  
I don't want to go home  
And be alone  
  
Could we stay out  
Could you drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going  
As long as I'm with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Chevy Nova  
Front seat sofa  
Getting closer  
To you  
  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going  
As long as I'm with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
I rather stay with you  
We can take the long way out  
  
To the country, out of town  
Let's get lost, I don't want to be found  
Let's get away now  
  
And be careful not to crash  
It's known there's frost and we're steaming the glass  
You hit the road, have a generous shoulder  
We could pull over  
And say we took the long way  
  
Headlights  
Strobe lights  
I can see you  
But not quite  
I can feel you  
Inside  
The timing  
Is just right  
For the moment  
I don't want  
To go home  
  
Take the long way out  
Oh, oh, oh  
Take the long way now  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going now  
Drive a little slower  
Don't matter where we're going now  
Drive a little slower  
Not ready to go home  
I'd rather stay with you  
We can take the long way  
  
Long drive, long night  
The best night of my life

There's a picture on my kitchen wall  
Looks like Jesus and his friends involved  
There's a party getting started in the yard  
There's a couple getting steamy in the car parked in the drive  
Was I too young to see this with my eyes?  
  
By the pool last night, apparently  
The chemicals weren't mixed properly  
You hit your head and then forgot your name  
And then you woke up at the bottom by the drain  
And now your altitude and memory's a shame  
  
[Chorus]  
What about taking this empty cup and filling it up  
With a little bit more of innocence  
I haven't had enough, it's probably because when you're young  
It's OK to be easily ignored  
I like to believe it was all about love for a child  
  
And when the house was left in shambles  
Who was there to handle all the broken bits of glass  
Was it mom who put my dad out on his ass or the other way around  
Well I'm far too old to care about that now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's kinda nice to work the floor since the divorce  
I've been enjoying both my Christmases and my birthday cakes  
And taking drugs and making love at far too young an age  
and they never check to see my grades  
What a fool I'd be to start complaining now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was all about love...

Love is real  
It is not just in novels  
Or the movies  
It is fact and it is standing here  
Right in front of you  
So if you just open your eyes  
Oh what a sweet discovery  
There is hope and there is joy  
And there is exceptance  
So now let all the light collect that collects on your plants  
Keep your wamr make you smile  
And I iwll be there with this pen in my hand  
To record all the while you'll be laughing so loud  
That the house would shake with sound  
And everything will be as new as the day  
It was found  
  
Love is real  
It is not just in long distance commercials  
Or something that you thought you  
Felt back in highschool  
So I will turn black and white  
Become that horoscope your readin'  
It predicts that something good is on it's way  
Oh and I'll send you all the world green and blue  
In a box through the mail  
You can open it up hold it right in your hand  
And be glad that it's there  
And be glad that you're there  
Now you can feel all the knotts in ur stomach  
They start to untie  
And suddenly it's not so hard to say your alright  
  
Oh.. Love is real  
It is not just in poetry and stories  
It is truth and it will follow you  
Everywhere you go from now on  
So if you just cast off your doubts  
Then your lips would answer for you  
Oh my darling when you smile it is like a song  
  
And I can heart it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now... Can hear it now  
And I can hear it now  
I can hear it now  
I can hear it now...

Do you hear me,  
I'm talking to you  
Across the water across the deep blue ocean  
Under the open sky, oh my, baby I'm trying  
Boy I hear you in my dreams  
I feel your whisper across the sea  
I keep you with me in my heart  
You make it easier when life gets hard  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm lucky I'm in love with my best friend  
Lucky to have been where I have been  
Lucky to be coming home again  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
  
They don't know how long it takes  
Waiting for a love like this  
Every time we say goodbye  
I wish we had one more kiss  
I'll wait for you I promise you, I will  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Lucky we're in love in every way  
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed  
Lucky to be coming home someday  
  
And so I'm sailing through the sea  
To an island where we'll meet  
You'll hear the music fill the air  
I'll put a flower in your hair  
Though the breezes through the trees  
Move so pretty you're all I see  
As the world keeps spinning round  
You hold me right here right now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm lucky we're in love in every way  
Lucky to have stayed where we have stayed  
Lucky to be coming home someday  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh

Wake up everyone  
How can you sleep at a time like this  
Unless the dreamer is the real you  
Listen to your voice  
The one that tells you to taste past the tip of your tongue  
Lip and the neck will appear  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna wake before  
The dream is over  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Yes I... I know it  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Yes I'll make it all mine  
  
I keep my life on a heavy rotation  
Requesting that it's lifting you up  
Up up and away  
And over to a table at the gratitude cafe  
  
And I am finally there  
And all the angels they'll be singing  
Ah la la la ah la la la I la la la la love you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And timing's everything  
And this time there's plenty  
I am balancing  
Careful and steady  
And reveling in energy that everyone's emitting  
  
I don't wanna wait no more  
No I wanna celebrate the whole world  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Because I'm following your joy  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Because I I am open  
I'm gonna make it mine  
Yes I... I'm gonna show it  
Yes I'm gonna make it mine  
It's mine  
Yes I will make it all mine

It's been nice to hold your hand  
As we shifted through this twisted abandon  
I would like to think that you will know your way  
We have dodged the ropes of rain  
Well the cats and dogs well they love to play  
On the handsome fella with umbrella  
Who once saved you your day  
  
And I will ask you to open my door from your side  
From the inside after you drive  
Because I wanna stay wet for a little bit longer  
That's why  
  
I warm the engine compartment up  
While I stand here and think it up  
But it's a little too early to bury the worries  
Til this wish is my command  
  
And I wonder, wonder which one of us  
Is gonna state the obvious  
And I wonder if you already know  
That I gotta let you go  
  
I know this ain't the way I planned it  
I guess I ain't the great romantic  
And I'm not doubling back now  
No doubling back  
Doubling back now  
  
Well before I catch you complaining that it hardly rains at all  
Let me stop to lock the top  
For fear of it falling hard  
By the eyes were ears and the arms are  
Scars of where the war was waged on words that we heard as a joke  
How did it drown our love  
  
Oh lord  
When it rains it's sure to pour  
But when I look in your eyes  
I fear I won't see surprise  
That I'm not doubling back cause  
I wonder, wonder which one of us  
Is gonna state the obvious  
And then I wonder if you already know  
That I gotta let you go  
  
I know this ain't the way I planned it  
I guess I ain't the great romantic  
And I'm not doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
Doubling back now  
No doubling back now  
No turning around now  
No going back now  
No

What's the worst thing that could happen?  
We could change our minds.  
That seems to be the hottest topic at this time.  
We are sitting around in the meditation, dragging, chasing,  
Wonderin' whose holdin' whose got the will to draw the line.  
  
I know you've got something burning up inside,  
It's so unhealthy but so good for me, oh!  
Said if I didn't know, and if I didn't know, well if I didn't know that you
loved me would you tell me?  
Well God only knows our contradiction's to quitting, is a hate to love
relationship thing.  
A fire under you is so fulfilling,  
I fear there's nothing more.  
  
I'm giving, giving you, the choke hold,  
My flirting with disaster is mighty loved.  
Ugggh you, you're so bold,  
My wanting to kiss you still is not enough.  
I'm getting over, all the comments.  
I'm feeling statements made by people are nonsense.  
I'm getting stronger, by the minute.  
And once I slip into position I'll swing you and turn you all around.  
  
You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever,  
You're the only way my time is measured.  
You might be the silent type,  
But your appetizing louder now.  
It's crazy how you're killing me.  
Woo, you're killing me, but I like your  
  
Red top and matching bottoms.  
You know the ones, the ones you got on,  
Pull them over your skinny self  
But don't cover your tattoo.  
Woo, cause I like to look at you, yeah,  
I love that smell on you,  
And I got your special place against this face for tasting too.  
  
And I like it natural,  
No need for chemicals.  
Foggin?up my senses  
You're making me sensless  
You're calling it sexual.  
  
And you're going to get yours, my lady.  
Might even be today.  
And it ain't no thing because I'll be rolling right along with you-woo-woo.  
  
You are the sweetest thing I've found since whenever.  
You're the only way my time is measured.  
You might be the silent type.  
But you're appetizing louder now.  
It's crazy how you're killing me.  
And give us both a break.  
And to give us back a taste when the way things were before they made the
laws,  
And to give us both a chance,  
But it won't be the last romance cause when the weekend starts the guilty
party's on.  
  
BREAKDOWN!!  
Weekend party's over,  
Don't stop, let's get closer.  
Friday, got cold shoulder,  
Monday, got a new composure.  
  
Weekend party's over,  
Don't stop, let's get lower.  
I won't blow your cover,  
Opportunistic lover.  
  
Weekend party's over,  
Don't stop, let's get closer.  
Friday's mediocre,  
Monday, I'm self-exposed now.  
  
Weekend party's over,  
Don't stop, let's suppose-ah  
I won't blow your cover  
Opportunistic lover.

Oh love it's a brittle madness, I sing about it in all my sadness  
It's not falsified to say that I found god so inevitably well,  
It still exists pale and fine. I can't dismiss  
And I won't resist and if I die well at least I tried  
  
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  
And pour over everything we say we trust  
It happened again, I listened in through hallways and thin doors  
Where the rivers unwind, rust and in the rain endure.  
The rust and the rain are sins  
And I'm in like Flynn again  
  
So go on place your order now cause some other time is right around the clock  
You can stand in line. it finally begins just around the clock  
You can have your pick if your stomach is sick whether you eat or not  
And there is just one thing that I never forgot  
  
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  
And pour over everything we say we trust  
It happened again, I listened in through hallways and thin doors  
Where the rivers unwind, rust and in the rain so easy  
These are the comforts that be  
  
You see well I'm feeling lucky oh well, maybe that's just me  
You should be proud of me oh hell if you could only see  
That we're gonna grow on up to be, ah yes  
We are thick as thieves  
  
Oh love it's a brittle madness, I sing about it in all my sadness  
It's not falsified to say that I found god  
Inevitably, well it still exists pale and fine I can't dismiss  
And I won't resist and if I die well at least I tried  
  
And we just lay awake in lust and rust in the rain  
And pour over everything we say we trust  
It happened again, I listened in through hallways and thin doors  
Where the rivers unwind and the rust and the rain endure  
(the rust and the rain endure. I'm sure.)  
  
I am insofar to know the measure of love isn't loss  
Love will never ever be insofar to know the measure of love isn't loss  
Love will never ever be lost on me.  
Love will never ever be lost on me.

One (...) going down,  
And then you slipped away,  
One stop at a time (out of town),  
We'll meet again someday.  
  
Cause I,  
I believe in love,  
I still wish on,  
Stars above,  
I believe in love songs,  
Yes, I think that they are real,  
All you have to do is feel.  
  
A chance missed for getting kissed,  
I think there's so much more than this,  
I will,  
Guess I'll have to hold my breath and say..  
  
That I,  
I believe in fate,  
I believe in good things coming to those who wait,  
Although I'm anticipating late,  
And all my hopes were beginning to fade,  
When you will me,  
How will we be,  
  
This is only one,  
Temporary find,  
I'm sure before too long,  
You will change your mind,  
One find,  
And this is only one of a many find,  
I'm sure before too long,  
You're gonna make up your mind.  
  
I know all about it,  
Well, I thought I did,  
So I wrote a song about it,  
And it goes a little something like this.  
  
See now I,  
I believe in love songs,  
Yes, I think that they are real,  
All you have to do, do, do,  
You tell me,  
All I have to do,  
Say,  
All we have to do,  
Is feel,  
Is feel,  
Feel, so right,  
Is feel,  
Feel, so nice,  
And this is so nice,  
And this is so right,  
And this is so right,  
Right, find, and fine by me.

All day I've been inside  
And I've got the feeling  
I'm trapped between the walls  
And underneath the ceiling  
I feel a bit off track  
And now I'm trying to get back  
  
Back in the cool cool air  
Where the sun in shining  
Nothing's gonna stop me  
It's all in the timing  
It's finally again my turn  
It's time to return  
  
Cause I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
I cannot wait to go outdoors  
Mmmhmmhmmhmm  
Hey hey hey (Elmo)  
  
Well open up your door  
And be like me  
Open up your door  
And then breathe free  
Look at all the beauty you'll feel  
Love love love love  
  
Listen to the music of the wind  
And the birdies sing  
We're just one big family  
And all of nature deserves to be  
Loved loved loved loved loved  
  
So I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
I'm sure  
There's no need to run and hide  
Let's go explore  
It feels so great  
  
Let's go outdoors  
  
Do do do do do do do do  
Everyone come on  
Come on out here  
Where the air is fresh and clear  
  
So I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
Let's go outdoors  
  
Jason:  
Well open up your door  
And be like me  
Open up your door  
And then breathe free  
Look at all the beauty  
And you'll find the earth  
And the sky is yours  
So please don't  
There's no need  
There's no need to hide inside  
Let's go explore  
This'll this'll  
It feels so great  
Let's go outdoors  
  
Everybody else(at same time):  
I won't stay inside  
No more no more  
It cannot wait  
I'm sure  
There's no need to run and hide  
Let's go explore  
It feels so great  
Let's go outdoors

Drain the veins in my head  
Clean out the reds in my eyes to get by security lines  
Dear x-ray machine  
Pretend you don't know me so well  
I won't tell if you lied  
Cry, cause the droughts been brought up  
Drinkin' cause you're lookin' so good in your Starbucks cup  
I complain for the company that I keep  
The windows for sleeping rearrange  
And I'm nobody  
Well who's laughin' now  
  
I'm leaving your town again  
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning  
And I'm up in the air so baby hell yeah  
Well Honey, I can see your house from here  
If the plane goes down, damn  
I'll remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down, damn  
  
Damn, I should be so lucky  
Even only 24 hours under your touch  
You know I need you so much  
I cannot wait to call you  
And tell you that I landed somewhere  
And hand you a square of the airport  
And walk you through the maze of the map  
That I'm gazing at  
Gracefully unnamed and feeling guilty for the luck  
And the look that you gave me  
You make me somebody  
Ain't nobody knows me  
Not even me can see it, yet I bet I'm  
  
I'm leaving your town again  
And I'm over the ground that you've been spinning  
And I'm up in the air, so baby hell yeah  
Oh honey I can see your house from here  
If the plane goes down, damn  
I'll remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down, damn  
  
You keep me high minded  
You get me high  
  
Flax seeds, well they tear me open  
And supposedly you can crawl right through me  
Taste these teeth please  
And undress me from these sweaters better hurry  
Cause I'm keeping upward bound now  
Oh maybe I'll build my house on your cloud  
Here I'm tumbling for you  
Stumbling through the work that I have to do  
Don't mean to harm you  
  
By leaving your town again  
But I'm over the quilt that you've been spinning  
But I'm up in the air, said baby hell yeah  
Oh honey I can see your house from here  
If the plane goes down, damn  
I'll remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down, damn  
I'll remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down, damn  
Well I'll remember where the love was found  
If the plane goes down, damn  
  
You keep me high  
You get me high minded  
You keep me high  
You get me high minded

I hear she's kickin' ass across the board  
And rock two hundred thousand higher scorer  
Just in time to save the world of being taken over  
She's a warrior  
I couldn't play again because the game  
It never end it never even landed on the can  
And never let me in to spend my quarter  
There's no love for me no more  
  
Say it isn't so  
How she easily come, how she easy go  
Please don't tell her that I miss her  
Because I don't  
  
She was the girl with the broadest shoulders  
But she would die before I crawled over them  
She is taller than I am  
She knew I wouldn't mind the view there  
Or the altitude with a mouth full of air  
She let me down and doubt came out until the now became later  
  
Say that it isn't so  
How she easily come, how she easy go  
Please don't tell her that I've been meaning to miss her  
Because I don't  
Not for her  
It's not that I'm mad to forgive  
Forget what I said  
  
That I'm crazy like the rest of us  
And I'm crazier when I'm next to her, ha  
  
So why after the all of everything that came  
And went I care enough to still be singing of the bitter end and broken eras  
I told you I don't but  
I am only trying to be the best with my intent to cure  
The rest is sure to lay me ease the plural hurts of the words of reverse
psychology  
That's easier said  
Easier than done  
Please don't dare tell her what I've become  
Please don't mention all the attention I have drawn  
Please don't bother cause she'll feel guilty when I'm gone  
  
Because I'm crazy like the rest of us  
And I'm crazier when I'm next to her  
And it's amazing how she's self-assured  
And I know she'd hate me if she knew my words  
Do I hurt anymore  
Do I hurt, well  
I don't  
I don't  
I don't

This is what I look like today  
And I'm trying not to pull out my hair  
I'm trying hard to grow it but I'm far too shy to grow it back there  
That is probably why I like wearing hats  
There's no denying I'm deferring the facts  
Avoiding confrontation  
Lacks tact in a situation  
Behind every line is a lesson yet to learn  
  
But if you asked me  
The feeling that I'm feeling is overwhelming  
And oh it goes to show  
There's so much to know  
  
I wrote this for my prettiest friend  
But while trying not to prove that I care  
I was trying not to make all my moves in one motion and scare her away  
She can't see she's making me crazy now  
I don't believe she knows she's amazing how  
She has me holding my breath  
So I'd never guess that I'm a nonesuch unsuitable, suitor for her  
  
And if you ask me  
The feeling that I'm feeling is complimentary  
And oh it goes to show  
The moral of the story is boy loves girl  
And so on, but the way that it unfolds is yet to be told  
  
I know that I should be brave  
Even pretty can be seen by the blind  
I know that I cannot wait  
Until the day we finally learn how to find each other  
Redefining open minds  
  
And if you ask me  
The feeling that I'm feeling is overjoyed  
And it's golden, it goes to show then  
The ending of this song should be left alone  
And so on cause the way it unfolds is yet to be told

I want to, I want to hold you  
  
Every time I go home there's another cellphone tower  
Construction getting louder,  
Paving over yesterdays  
You and I, we will try to find the side of it that's pretty  
While our town becomes a city,  
We won't let it be erased  
Empires rise, empires fall  
Will you be my constant through it all?  
  
I will hold your hand and watch the world spin idly around this life we're in  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet  
When it's you I'm with  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet  
When it's you I'm with  
You, you, you...  
  
Every once in a while,  
You know I get these real bad headaches  
Worried about the mistakes  
That I've made along the way  
You and I, we can't hide from the fact that we need each other  
How else will I recover when the fever comes again  
  
Temperatures rise  
Temperatures fall  
Will you be my constant through it all?  
  
I will hold your hand and watch the world spin idly around this life we're in  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with  
You, you, you...  
  
There are no words, no words when  
I'm with you, you, you  
Every time I hear music  
They've added more stuff to it  
Things are always moving into a futuristic place  
Where you and I will try  
We'll try to dance into tomorrow  
But time will have to borrow  
Not a minute left to waste  
  
Heartbeats rise, heartbeats fall  
Will you be my constant through it all?  
  
I will hold your hand  
And watch the world spin idly around this life we're in  
Oh yeah everything goes quiet when it's you I'm with [x4]

Why are there so many  
Songs about Rainbows  
And whats on the other side  
Rainbows are visions  
But only Illusions  
Rainbows have nothing to hide  
  
Whats so amazing  
That it keeps us star gazing  
And what do they think we might see  
Oh, someday we'll find it  
The Rainbow Connection  
The lovers, the dreamers, and me  
  
Have you been half asleep  
And have you heard the voices  
Well, I've heard them calling my name  
Is this the sweet sound  
That calls the young sailors  
The voice might be one and the same  
  
I've heard it too many, many, many times to ignore it  
Oh, who did I think it could be  
Oh, someday we'll find it  
  
The Rainbow Connection  
The lovers, the dreamers and me [Repeats]

His after moan though cries oh no  
He's building up a shine but he take it slow  
And he knows it time to make a change here And time to get away  
And he knows it's time for all the wrong reasons And time to end the pain  
But he sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we Sleep all day over again  
Why don't we?  
  
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord  
Would he take it all back what they've done  
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands  
That was my old man and he said  
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it  
  
Oh what a lovely day to have a slice of humble pie  
Recalling of the while we used to drive and drive here and there  
Going nowhere but for us, nowhere but for the two of us  
And we knew it was time to take a chance here  
And time to compromise our lives for awhile  
And it was time for all the wrong reasons  
But time is often on my side and I give it to you tonight  
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again  
  
As time goes by we get a little bit tired waking and baked another Marlboro
mile wide  
It's sending the boys on the run in the time in hot summer sun  
To swim beneath or over outside as they're reading between the lines  
Then they remember the part in the hallmark card where they read about the
dreams  
And reaching for the stars to hold on a little bit closer to  
And they knew it was time, time to take a chance here  
Time to compromise our little lives for just a little while  
And they knew it was time for all the wrong reasons  
As time is often on my side and I give it to you, oh boy  
And we sleep all, sleep all day, sleep all, we sleep all day over again  
  
She said what would your mother think and how would your father react oh lord  
Would he take it all back what they've done  
No way he said take it, take it and don't break it with your own two hands  
That was my old man and he said  
If all is grounded you should go make a mountain out of it

I'm dreaming of sleeping next to you  
I'm feeling like a lost little boy in a brand new town  
I'm counting my sheep and  
each one that passes is another dream to ashes and they all fall down.  
  
As I lay me down tonight,  
I close my eyes and what a beautiful sight  
  
I'm sleeping to dream about you  
I'm so tired of having to live without you  
But I don't mind  
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired  
  
I found myself in the riches your eyes, your lips, your hair  
Well you were everywhere  
But I woke up in the ditches. I hit the light and I thought you might be here  
but you were nowhere. You were nowhere at home.  
  
As I lay me back to sleep  
Lord I pray that I can keep  
  
Sleeping to dream about you  
I'm so tired of having to live without you  
But I don't mind  
I'm sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired  
  
It's just a little a lullaby to keep myself from crying myself to sleep at
night  
  
Sleeping to dream about you  
I'm so tired of having to live without you  
But I don't mind  
Sleeping to dream about you and I'm so tired

Jason: D.C. 930. How many people from Virginia in here tonight?  
Very cool, very cool. I grew up in Virginia.  
This is the closest Ive ever played to home, so  
This is very very groovy. Lets see what happens.  
  
Strange because I believe it is my future  
Staring back at me  
With eyes so light  
I never dreamed it could be  
Anything else than what they could see  
Oh, they are colors  
That collide and scope  
My heart belongs into  
Magnificent ever-changing patterns do  
Im wide awake at the wheel  
Its oh so crazy because I can see  
It could be my presence  
So pleasantly deprived  
Ive never seen the explained prophecies  
Or anything else it should be  
Oh they are troubled  
And disguised behind wise eyes and wise crackin smiles  
Hypnotized behind a panel  
On a thirty hour drive  
Im not at all what I seem  
But my intentions are practical inventions  
Forgot to mention Im insane by definition  
Were taking pictures on the paper  
No escape, the morning after I outride the wave  
  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Said, all in all, it's unlikely  
But all in all, it's unlikely well succeed  
All in all, I said, it's unlikely  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Ive developed a lovely distaste for your heart on my sleeve, yeah  
(scatting)  
  
We keep it simple  
Keep it clean  
Keep repeating the words as often as you need  
Oh, think, think  
Blinks like a turning signal me to  
Turn, turn away oh  
From anything good, people say  
Oh now, I will be selective, calm, cool and collective  
And listening to the voice and it's perspective  
Hoping that the choices, appropriately respected  
Are protecting me, are protecting me  
Hey, hey, protecting me, protecting me  
And I would like a little sugar in my coffee  
I would like a little dream  
And I'd prefer another smoke before the morning  
Or anything else in between  
  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Said, all in all, it's unlikely  
All in all, it's unlikely well succeed  
All in all, I said, it's unlikely  
But all in all, it's unlikely I'll succeed  
Ive developed a lovely distaste for your wide open spaces  
I sense a delay  
Oh, brushing my mind and scrubbing behind all the places I feel there's decay  
Of information  
Away, I say run, boy  
(scatting)  
  
Oh, oh we keep it  
So wicked and it's wild  
Your past, your former style  
Oh they can make believe in  
Knowing why you're leaving  
Youre just wanting to be on your own  
I said, you're wanting to be on your own  
Yeah, you wanted to be on your own  
I said, you're wanting to be on your own

I see the curtains hangin in the window in the evenin on a Friday eve-night,  
A little light shinin through the window lets me know that everything's
alright  
Summer breeze really makes me feel fine,  
Blowing through the jasmine in my mind  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowing through my makes me feel alright  
Makin me feel makin me feel fine  
Makes me feel fine  
Blowin through the jasmine in my mind  
O, sweet days of summer the jasmines in bloom  
July is dressed up and playing a tune  
And when I come home from a hard day's work  
And your waiting there  
Yes your waiting there without a care in the world  
Sometimes I see the smile waiting in the kitchen food a cookin and a place
there for two  
I see the arms that reach out to hold me in the evenin when the day is through  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine  
Blowin through the jasmine in my mind  
Summer breeze makes me feel fine blowin through my makin me feel alright  
Makin me feel makin me feel fine makes me feel right  
blowin through the jasmine in my  
Blowin blowin  
Blowin through the jasmine in my  
Blowin blowin  
Blowin through the jasmine in my  
Blowin blowin  
Blowin through the jasmine in my  
Blowin blowin  
Blowin through the jasmine in my blowin,  
Blowin through the jasmine in my mind  

She's so big hearted,  
But not so remarkable  
just an ordinary humble girl  
expecting nothing as we're made to think  
Its a pretty person's world  
but you are beautiful and you better go show it  
go look again, you gotta be true to your own  
if you really wanna go to the top  
do you really wanna win?  
Don't believe in living normal, just to satisfy demand  
well if you wanna get free  
and if you wanna do the passionate thing  
and if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart  
you should own your name and stand up tall  
and get real and see the beauty in ugly  
well you are fresh, you're face is fabulous  
don't forget you're one of a kind  
when nobody is checking the deeds you've done  
And nobody is hearing your cries  
you make all of the fashion statements  
Just by dressing up your mind  
Well if you wanna get free  
and if you wanna do the passionate thing  
and if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart  
you should own your name and stand up tall  
and get real and see the beauty in ugly  
and see the beauty in ulgy  
well if you wanna get free  
and if you wanna do the passionate thing  
and if you wanna get smart for the sake of your heart and oh  
you should own your name and stand up tall  
and get real and see the beauty in ugly  
see the beauty in a ulgy

The boy's gone. The boy's gone home.  
  
What will happen to a face in the crowd when it finally gets too crowded.  
And will happen to the origins of sound after all the sounds have sounded  
Well I hope I never have to see that day but by god I know it's headed our way  
So I better be happy now that the boy's going home. The boy's gone home.  
  
And what becomes of a day for those who rage against it  
And who will sum op the phrase for all left standing around in it  
  
Well I suppose we'll all make our judgment call  
We'll walk it alone, stand up tall, then march to the fall  
So we better be happy now that we'll all go home.  
  
Be so happy with the way you are  
Be so happy that you made it this far  
Go on be happy now. Please be happy now  
  
Because this is something else  
This is something else  
  
I tried to live my life and live it so well  
But when it's all over is it heaven or is it hell  
I better be happy now that no one can tell, nobody knows  
I'm gonna be happy with the way that I am  
I'm gonna be happy with all that I stand for  
I'm gonna be happy now because the boy's going home.  
  
The boy's gone home.

Well I'm not just a song anymore  
I just might be the whole damn score  
I might be realing in your head while  
You're sleeping in your bed at night  
Well I'm not just along anymore  
I finally found what I've been lookin for  
I might be sitting in the passenger's  
Side but not along for the ride  
Cause I have control of a home grown situation  
I lay back and then I turn the alarm off and turn out the light  
There's goin to be some quality sleeping  
'cause quality's keeping the quality up at night  
I am fixed to lay with my arms out and learning to fly  
  
Through the darkest space  
Where I try to catch up to the catch phrase  
To human race I say let the games begin  
Under way say in conditions that we play in  
Maybe things are better this way  
May the games begin today awww  
  
Oh well... Cause I'm just above  
The aggrevation of love  
And I raise to opimistical fortune and toasting it twice  
I'm sitting high on an anytime any day night  
And I laugh to think I'm crying my eyes out well isn't it nice  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
An open space when I finally catch up to the catch phrase  
The whole damn world is your toy  
Don't you want some love  
Don't you want things to always stay the same  
Don't you want your love to be the same as the last day

I've got the dynamo of volition  
With po-pole position  
Automatic transmission with lo-ow emissions  
I'm a brand new addition to the old edition  
With the love unconditional  
  
I'm a drama abolitionist  
Damn no opposition to my proposition  
Half of a man, half magician  
Half a politician holding the mic  
Like ammunition  
And my vision is as simple as light  
  
Ain't no reason we should be in a fight  
No demolition  
Get to vote, get to say what you like  
Procreation  
Compositions already written by themselves  
Saying heck is for the people not believin' in gosh  
  
[Chorus]  
Good Job  
Get 'em up way high  
Gimme gimme that high five  
Good time  
Get 'em way down low  
Gimme gimme that low dough  
Good God  
Bring 'em back again  
Gimme gimme that high ten  
  
You're the best definition of good intentions  
  
I do not answer the call if  
I do not know who is calling  
I guess the whole point of it all is  
That we never know really  
  
I'm tryin' to keep with the Joneses  
While waiting for guns and the roses  
To finish what we all suppose is  
That shit's so silly  
  
Oh, fist like pumpin' and wrist lock  
Twisting up a rizla  
Kid Icarus on the transistor  
Nintendo been givin' me the blister  
I bend over take it in the kisser  
  
Best friends are hittin' on my sister.  
Try to tell them that they still wish-a  
Cause she already got herself a mister  
And besides that's gross to want to dis her  
Didn't I say, didn't I say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a representation of good versus evil  
  
I do not keep up with statistics  
I do not sleep without a mistress  
I do not eat unless it's fixed with  
Some kind of sweet like a licorice  
My home is deep inside the mystics  
I'm known to keep diggin' on existence  
I'm holdin' in the heat like a fish-stick  
And my phone it beeps because I missed it  
  
I do not answer the phone if  
I do not know who is calling  
I guess the whole point of it all is  
Fuck's sake, can I get a witness  
  
I'm only a boy in a story  
Just a hallucinatory  
Trippin' on nothing there is  
Living in the wilderness  
  
With a tiger spot on my back  
Living life of a cat  
I just wanna relax here  
And sing another rap tune  
Driving off on your blind man's bike  
You can say just what you like  
Or nothing can stop you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're the best definition of good versus evil  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're a representation of good intention  
You're the best definition of good intention  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
You're the best around  
And nothings ever gonna take you down  
  
You're the best around

Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call me the gangster love  
And some people call me Maurice  
Cause I speak of the competence of love.  
Well, people talkin about me, baby  
They say I'm doing wrong, I'm doing wrong.  
Don't you worry, don't you worry, don't you worry dirty mama,  
Cause I'm right here, right here, right here, right here headin' home.  
  
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, and I'm a sinner  
I play my music in the sun  
I'm a joker, I'm a smoker, I'm a midnight toker.  
I get my lovin' on the run.  
  
You sheltered me from harm  
Kept me warm, kept me warm  
You gave my love to me  
Set me free, set me free  
The finest years I ever knew  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
People talking about me baby  
They say I'm doing, I'm doing, I'm doing you all wrong  
Don't you worry, don't you worry mama  
Right here, right here, right home  
  
Is there someone you know  
You're lovin them so  
But taken them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say  
  
I'm a picker, I'm a grinner, I'm a lover, a sinner  
I play my music in the sun, I play my music in the sun  
I'm a joker, a smoker, and I'm a midnight toker.  
She don't wanna hurt no one  
  
Some people call me the space cowboy  
Some call the gangster love  
And some people call me Maurice  
Cause I speak the competence of love  
I speak the competence  
Cause I speak of love (once again)

Well I saw fireworks from the freeway.  
And behind closed eyes I cannot make them go away  
'Cause you were born on the fourth of july freedom ring  
Now something on the surface it stings  
I said something on the surface  
Well it kind of makes me nervous  
Who says that you deserve this?  
And what kind of god would serve this?  
We will cure this dirty old disease  
Well if you've got the poison I've got the remedy  
  
The remedy is the experience.  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that it's serious.  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end.  
  
I won't worry my life away.  
I won't worry my life away.  
  
Well I heard two men talking on the radio  
In a cross fire kind of reality show  
Uncovering the ways to plan the next big attack  
They were counting down the ways to stab  
The brother in the be right back after this  
The unavoidable kiss, where the minty fresh  
Death breath is sure to outlast this catastrophy  
Dance with me, because if you've got the poison,  
I've got the remedy  
  
The remedy is the experience.  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that it's serious.  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end.  
  
I won't worry my life away.  
I won't worry my life away.  
  
When I fall in love I take my time  
There's no need to hurry when I'm making up my mind  
You can turn off the sun but I'm still gonna shine and I'll tell you why  
  
Because  
  
The remedy is the experience.  
This is a dangerous liaison  
I say the comedy is that it's serious.  
This is a strange enough new play on words  
I say the tragedy is how you're gonna spend  
The rest of your nights with the light on  
So shine the light on all of your friends  
When it all amounts to nothing in the end.  
  
I won't worry my life away  
I won't worry my life away  
I won't and I won't and I won't

Well sometimes the sun shines on  
Other people's houses and not mine.  
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray  
And it takes away my summertime.  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,  
While I struggle to get mine.  
If there's a light in everybody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine.  
  
I want to walk the same roads as everybody else, Through the trees and past
the gates.  
Getting high on heavenly breezes,  
Making new friends along the way.  
I won't ask much of nobody,  
I'm just here to sing along.  
And make my mistakes looks gracious,  
And learn some lessons from my wrongs.  
  
Well sometimes the sun shines on  
Other people's houses and not mine.  
Some days the clouds paint the sky all gray  
And it takes away my summertime.  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,  
While I struggle to get mine.  
A little light never hurt nobody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine.  
  
Oh, if this little light of mine  
Combined with yours today,  
How many watts could we luminate?  
How many villages could we save?  
  
And my umbrella's tired of the weather,  
Wearing me down.  
Well, look at me now.  
  
You should look as good as your outlook,  
Would you mind if I took some time,  
to soak up your light, your beautiful light?  
You've got a paradise inside.  
I get hungry for love and thirsty for life,  
And much too full on the pain,  
When I look to the sky to help me  
And sometimes it looks like rain.  
  
As the sun shines on other people's houses  
And not mine,  
And the sky paints those clouds in a way  
That it takes away the summertime,  
Somehow the sun keeps shining upon you,  
while I kindly stand by.  
If theres a light in everybody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine  
  
You're undeniably warm, you're cerulean,  
You're perfect in desire.  
Won't you hang around  
so the sun, it can shine on me,  
And the clouds they can roll away,  
And the sky can become a possibility?  
If there's a light in everybody,  
Send out your ray of sunshine

Maybe I annoy you with my choices  
Well, you annoy me sometimes too with your voice  
But that ain't enough for me  
To move out and move on  
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love  
  
We don't have to hurry  
You can take as long as you want  
I'm holdin' steady  
My heart's at home  
With my hand behind you  
I will catch you if you fall  
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love  
  
Sometimes the world can make you feel  
You're not welcome anymore  
And you beat yourself up  
You let yourself get mad  
And in those times when you stop lovin'  
That woman I adore  
You could relax  
Because, babe, I got your back  
I got you  
  
No, I don't wish to change you  
You got it under control  
You wake up each day different  
Another reason for me to keep holdin' on  
I'm not attached to any way you're showing up  
I'm just gonna love you like the woman I love  
Yeah I'm gonna love you, oh yeah  
I'm gonna love you  
You're the woman I love

The night.  
She brushed her hands upon my flushed cheek  
Smelled of childhood remnants of a dusty weeping willow  
Clouds soothe, Shredded by the calico  
Were oh so vast and quick as I was on my own now.  
  
This time like every other time I believe that I never find  
Another sweet little girl with sequined sea foam eyes  
Ocean lapping voice smile coy as the brightest quiet span of sky  
And I'm all alone again tonight not again, not again, not again.  
  
And don't it feel alright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely.  
  
Still I'm unable to inhale all the riches  
As I'm awkward as a wound on my bones  
Still I've got cobblestone joints and plate glass points  
As I'm all by myself tonight not again not again  
  
And don't it feel alright. and don't it feel so nice. Lovely.  
  
Well if you should nervously break down  
When its time for the shakedown would you take it  
It's when you cry just a little but you laugh in the middle that you've made
it  
And don't it feel alright. and don't it feel so nice.  
Lovely.  
  
Say it again. Lovely. So lovely. to do it again  
Again. Loving again. It's coming again.  
Lovely.

You can say that I'm one curly fry in the box of the regular  
Messing with the flavor oh the flavor that you savor  
Saving me for last but you better not eat me at all  
Living in a fast food bag making friends with the ketchup and salt  
People say that I'm crazy for not moving on to better things  
Instead I'm sitting around trash talking with the onion rings  
But it's much too soon to leave this easy life  
Pass me the spoon. Pass the analytical knife  
  
Cause your about to get cut and get cut down  
It's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice  
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold  
Better shut up or get shot down. It's all about the know how all just a matter
of taste  
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.  
  
Believe it or not I super sized my sights on the surprise in the cereal box  
My stomachs smaller than my eyes  
so I went to see the doctor and he said "turn your head and then cough"  
I didn't listen to what he said instead I couldn't wait to get off  
He said I can have this but I can't have that  
That I should keep wishing I was living the life of a cat because  
I ain't the one whose gonna be missing the feast  
Just like you ain't the one who seems to be calming the beast  
  
Now your about to get cut and get cut down  
It's all about the wordplay all about the sound in the tone of my voice  
You gotta let me make my choice alone before my food gets cold  
Better shut up or get shot down. It s all about the know how all just a matter
of taste  
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.  
  
Well if you are what you eat in my case I'll be sweet so come and get some  
I'm so over it.  
  
Now your about to get cut and get cut down  
It s all about the know how all just a matter of taste  
Stop telling me the way I gotta play. Too much food on my plate.  
(Get up and get some)  
There's too much food on my plate

Hands in line  
Arms close to my side  
I'm fighting tides of an ocean's undertow  
And I figure I might not make it  
And I'm taking empty  
But seldom keeping  
And the words retreat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold.  
  
My hands are high  
And I'm holding out, holding up  
Because I figure that I just might make it  
And I'm waking empty but seldom sleeping  
And the words repeat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold.  
  
Quality is what you see now in the corner of your eye.  
Don't be surprised if you hear the bells ring  
They form from the sky and they sound bong, bong, bong  
And I'm holding up because I figure that I just make it.  
  
And I'm waking empty but seldom sleeping  
And the words repeat breathing histories into stories untold  
And I unfold.

In a certain row of a garden grove  
A lady learns to sleep  
While surrounded, not where all the flowers grow  
On an empty orchard street  
She is dreaming of her holiday  
From a working glass menagerie  
Oh her hands are cold  
Unimaginable that shes warming up to me  
  
I'm a passerby in a promise land  
And I face no direction  
Somewhere between the towns of lost and found  
In the state of confusion  
Sure our dreaming is pure wonderment  
But our feelings are no accident  
If my heart is cold it won't forever be,  
Cause your warming up to me  
  
And fate is not a mission  
Its an unconditional high  
When I saw you in the garden  
You reminded me  
I can see, the stars are on your shoulders now  
And what the wind and your skin have in common  
Am I taller? Well if feels as though I'm above the ground  
You're inviting me to go down  
  
Are you warming up?  
Are you burning up?  
Warming up to love?  
Are you warming up tonight?

It takes a crane to build a crane  
It takes two floors to make a story  
It takes an egg to make a hen  
It takes a hen to make an egg  
There is no end to what I'm saying  
  
It takes a thought to make a word  
And it takes a word to make an action  
It takes some work to make it work  
It takes some good to make it hurt  
It takes some bad for satisfaction  
  
La la la la la la la life is wonderful  
Ah la la la la la la life is full circle  
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful  
Al la la la la  
  
It takes a night to make it dawn  
And it takes a day to you yawn brother  
It takes a mood to make you young  
It takes some cold to know the sun  
It takes the one to have the other  
  
It takes no time to fall in love  
But it takes you years to know what love is  
It takes some tears to make you trust  
It takes some years to make it rust  
It takes some dust to make it polished  
  
Ha la la la la la la life is wonderful  
Ah la la la la la la life is full circle  
Ah la la la la la la life is so full of  
Ah la la la la la la life is so rough  
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful  
Ah la la la la la la life is full circle  
Ah la la la la la la life is our love  
Ah la la la la la  
  
It takes some silence to make sound  
It takes a loss before you found it  
It takes a road to go nowhere  
It takes a toll to know you care  
It takes a hole to make a mountain  
  
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful  
Ah la la la la la la life is full circle  
Ah la la la la la la life is oh love  
Ah la la la la la la love is all sorts of  
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful  
Ah la la la la la la life is full circle  
Ah la la la la la la life is holla holla  
Ah la la la la la la next up bushwalla-walla  
Ah la la la la la la life is wonderful  
Ah la la la la la

When we die is it just like sleeping?  
Does the light mean that it's light like in air?  
Will I dream? Will I get to meet Jesus?  
Or like the lover will I come right back?  
  
Years go fast live each day like it's the last,  
Need not waste time asking why did my life,  
No holding back  
  
Like a wind we've been solved,  
We sing to the memories of long days  
Gone so do I sing along, I'll remember you  
  
Years go fast, I'm already looking back,  
Me, I know I won't last cause when I cry I don't just cry  
I fold in half  
  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
  
There's a fear about leaving here  
That the devil you will find but if love,  
If love is all there ever was,  
There'll be peace on the other side  
  
Years go fast live each day like it's the last,  
Me, I'll go out dancing cause when I die  
I know I'm gonna fly into an angels hands  
  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved, you are loved,  
You are loved

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening,  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight,  
We're happy tonight,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
And gone away is the bluebird,  
But here to stay, stay, stay is the new bird  
He sings a love song,  
As we go along,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman,  
Then pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say: Are you married?  
We'll say: No man,  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town.  
  
Later on, we'll conspire,  
As we dream by the fire babe  
We'll face unafraid,  
All the plans that we've made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
Later on, we'll conspire,  
As we dream by the fire babe  
We'll face unafraid,  
All the plans that we made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
We'll face unafraid,  
All the plans that we made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.  
  
To face unafraid,  
All the plans that we made,  
We're walking in a winter wonderland.

Well I don't know  
Just what I'm here for  
I want more than words can describe  
I've been deprived  
Can you believe it  
My whole world  
Well it's falling apart  
Well it falls  
Still it falls  
Well it falls apart around me  
  
And you pick me back up  
Oh, said you pick me back up  
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
Said you pick me back up  
Oh, said you pick me back up  
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
Cause I'm drinking all of the tears you cry  
  
And I don't wish to know my ending  
I just say  
I wanna know when I begun  
I wanna know when I begun  
I wanna know where it started from  
Where it all started from  
Cause I feel like I am spinning  
I feel like I'm spinning  
I feel just like I'm spinning  
I'm spinning around  
Said I feel like I am spinning  
All around the summer  
And the winter comes and another storm  
And it falls  
Well it falls  
Still it falls apart around me  
  
And you pick me back up  
Oh, said you pick me back up  
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
Oh my, my, my  
Said you pick me back up  
Oh, said you pick me back up  
Oh, you're gonna pick me back up  
And you get me high  
  
I'm drinking all of the tears you cry  
Breathing every breath that you sigh  
I'm drinking all of the that you cry  
That you cry  
All the tears that you cry  
Breathing every breath that you sign
