And I love you so  
The people ask me how  
How I've lived till now  
I tell them I don't know  
  
I guess they understand  
How lonely life has been  
But life began again  
The day you took my hand  
  
And yes, I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me 'n' the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening get me down  
Now that you're around me  
  
And you love me, too  
Your thoughts are just for me  
You set my spirit free  
I'm happy that you do  
  
The book of life is brief  
And once a page is read  
All but life is dead  
That is my belief  
  
And yes, I know how lonely life can be  
The shadows follow me and the night won't set me free  
But I don't let the evening get me down  
Now that you're around me

Angry, please don't be angry,  
'Cause I was only teasing you!  
I wouldn't even let you think of leavin'  
Don't you know I love you true!  
Just because I took a look at somebody else,  
That's no reason you should put poor me on the shelf!  
Angry, please don't be angry,  
'Cause I was only teasing you!  
Don't believe a thing you hear, just wait 'till you see,  
Then you'll find no cause to show that you're jealous of me!  
Oh! Angry, please don't be angry,  
'Cause I was only teasing you!  
Music by Henry Brunies and Jules Cassard  
With lyrics by Dudley Mecum, 1925  

Arrivederci roma,  
Goodbye, goodbye to rome. ..  
  
City of a million moonlit places,  
City of a million warm embraces,  
Where I found the one of all the faces,  
Far from home!  
  
Arrivederci roma,  
It's time for us to part,  
  
Save the wedding bells for my returning,  
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning,  
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning,  
In her heart!  
  
City of a million moonlit places,  
City of a million warm embraces,  
Where I found the one of all the faces,  
Far from home!  
  
Arrivederci roma,  
It's time for us to part,  
  
Save the wedding bells for my returning,  
Keep my lover's arms outstretched and yearning,  
Please be sure the flame of love keeps burning,  
In her heart!  
  
Arrivederci roma,  
Roma, roma, roma. ..

You must remember this, a kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh, the fundamental things apply,  
As time goes by  
  
An' when two lovers woo, they still say "I love you,"  
On that you can rely, no matter what the future brings,  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight an' love songs never out of date,  
Hearts full of passion, jealousy an' hate,  
Woman needs man and man must have his mate,  
That no one can deny  
  
It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,  
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,  
As time goes by  
  
It's still the same old story, a fight for love an' glory,  
A case of do or die, the world will always welcome lovers,  
As time goes by

And Aubrey was her name,  
And not so very ordinary girl, or name  
But who's to blame  
For a love that wouldn't bloom  
For the hearts that never played in tune ?  
  
Like a lovely melody  
That everyone can sing  
Take away the words that rhyme  
It doesn't mean a thing  
  
And Aubrey was her name  
We tripped the light  
And danced together to the moon  
But where was June?  
No, it never came around  
If it did, it never made a sound  
Maybe I was absent  
Or was listening too fast  
Catching all the words  
But then, the meaning going past  
  
Oh, how I miss the girl  
And I'd go a thousand times around the world  
Just to be  
Closer to her, than to me  
  
And Aubrey was her name  
I never knew her  
But I loved her just the same  
I loved her name  
  
Wish that I had found a way  
And the reasons that would make her stay  
I have learned to lead a life  
Apart from all the rest  
If I can't have the one I want  
I'll go without the best  
  
Oh, how I miss the girl  
And I'd go a million times around the world  
Just to say  
She had been mine for a day!

Ave Maria  
Gratia plena

Benedicta tu in mulierbus  
Et benedictus

Mater Dei)  
  
Ora pro nobis peccatoribus  
Ora, ora pro nobis

Nunc et in hora mortis  
In hora mortis nostres  
In hora mortis nostres  
In hora mortis nostres

The bird with feathers of blue is waiting for you  
Back in your own backyard  
You'll see your castle in Spain through your windowpane  
Back in your own backyard  
  
Oh, you can go to the east, go to the west  
But someday you'll come, weary at heart  
Back where you started from  
You'll find, your happiness lies right under your eyes  
Back in your own backyard  
  
The bird with feathers of blue is waiting for you  
Back in your own backyard  
You'll see your castle in Spain through your windowpane  
Back in your own backyard  
  
Oh, you can go to the east, go to the west  
But someday you'll come, weary at heart  
Back where you started from  
You'll find, your happiness lies right under your eyes  
Back in your own backyard

Someone who would try to understand  
Someone who'd be thrilled to touch my hand  
An' through all eternity, she'd be good for only me  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
Someone who could make her lips so warm  
That my lonely heart could brave each storm  
Someone who'd be miles away, still within her heart I'd stay  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
Or, did I ask too much, when I met you?  
Or, was the task too much to just be a little true?  
I've been told it only hurts a while  
But my broken heart won't crack a smile  
  
Till that someone comes along  
With a love that proves me wrong  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
I've been told it only hurts a while  
But my broken heart won't crack a smile  
Till that someone comes along  
With a love that proves me wrong  
Beats there a heart so true?  
  
So true

Because, you come to me,  
With naught save love,  
And hold my hand and lift mine eyes above,  
A wider world of hope and joy I see,  
Because you come to me!  
  
Because you speak to me in accent sweet,  
I find the roses waking 'round my feet,  
And I am led through tears and joy to thee,  
Because you speak to me!  
  
Because God made thee mine,  
I'll cherish thee,  
Through light and darkness through all time to be,  
And pray His love may make our love divine,  
Because God made thee mine!

When they begin the beguine  
It brings back the sound of music so tender  
It brings back the night of tropical splendor  
It brings back a memory evergreen!  
  
I'm with you once more under the stars  
And down by the shore an orchestra's playin'  
Even the palms seems to be swayin'  
When they begin the beguine!  
  
To live it again is past all endeavor  
Except when that tune clutches my heart  
And there we are swearin' to love forever  
And promising never, never to part!  
  
What moments divine, what raptures serene  
'Till clouds came along to disperse the joys we had tasted...  
Now, when I hear people curse the chance that was wasted  
I know but too well what they mean!  
  
So, don't let them begin the beguine  
Let the love that was once a fire remain an ember...  
Let it sleep like the dead desire I only remember  
When they begin the beguine!  
  
Oh yes, let them begin the beguine, make them play!  
'Till the stars that were there before return above you  
'Till you whisper to me once more, "Darling, I love you!"  
And we suddenly know, what heaven we're in  
When they begin the beguine!  
When they begin, the beguine!

Lord don't she make me proud!  
She never makes a scene  
By hangin' all over me in a crowd!  
  
'Cause people love to talk,  
Lord don't they love to talk!  
But when they turn out the lights,  
I know she'll be leaving with me!  
  
When we get behind closed doors,  
Then she lets her hair hang down  
And she makes me glad that I'm a man . . .  
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors!  
  
My baby makes me smile,  
Lord don't she make me smile!  
She's never far away  
Or too tired to say "I want you!"  
  
She's always a lady  
Just like a lady should be!  
But when they turn out the lights,  
She's still a baby with me!  
  
When we get behind closed doors,  
Then she lets her hair hang down  
And she makes me glad that I'm a man . . .  
Oh no one knows what goes on behind closed doors!  
  
Oh no one knows  
What goes on behind closed doors!  
( Behind closed doors! Behind closed doors! )  
Behind closed doors!

I don't want you  
But I hate to lose you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
I forgive you  
'Cause I can't forget you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come a knockin' at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I keep runnin' back for more!  
  
I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
Hmm, you got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
I ought to cross you off my list  
But when you come a knockin' at my door  
Fate seems to give my heart a twist  
And I keep runnin' back for more!  
  
Hmm, I should hate you  
But I guess I love you  
You got me in between  
The devil and the deep blue sea!  
  
You got me in between  
The devil...and the deep blue sea!...and the deep blue sea!

Lost in the shuffle, I've drifted and strayed  
Bruised by the city, bewildered, betrayed  
With a heart heavy laden with faltering strides  
I have come to the bridge, to the line that divides  
  
What am I doing up here in a daze  
As I gaze at the cold river bed  
Why do I ask myself, shall I go back  
When I seem to be going ahead  
  
To black moonlight  
Where everything reflects your color  
Darkness that is endless  
Nights that leave me friendless, blue  
  
Black moonlight  
You make the lights of Harlem duller  
Just like me you're faded, jaded and degraded, too  
Why must you send  
Ebony moonbeams, depressing, distressing  
Like shadows of love that are gone  
  
Where will it end  
Will it spread on to the starlight, the sunlight  
And darken each promise of dawn  
  
Black moonlight  
I've lost all power to resist you  
Madly, I await you, even though I hate you  
Black, black moonlight

Bless this house, O Lord we pray,  
Make it safe by night and day . . .  
Bless these walls so firm and stout,  
Keeping want and trouble out . . .  
Bless the roof and chimneys tall,  
Let thy peace lie overall . . .  
Bless this door that it may prove,  
Ever open,  
To joy and love . . .  
Bless these windows shining bright,  
Letting in God's Heavenly light,  
Bless the hearth, ablazing there,  
With smoke ascending like a prayer!  
Bless the people here within,  
Keep them pure and free from sin . . .  
Bless us all that we may be,  
Fit O Lord to dwell with thee . . .  
Bless us all that one day we may dwell,  
O Lord! With Thee!

We'll have a blue room,  
A new room, for two room.  
Where every day's a holiday,  
Because you're married to me  
  
Not like a ball room,  
A small room, a hall room,  
Where I can smoke my pipe away,  
With your wee head upon my knee  
  
We will thrive on, keep alive on,  
Just nothing but kisses,  
With mister and missus,  
Own little blue chairs  
  
You sew your trousseau,  
and Robinson Crusoe,  
Is not so far from worldly cares,  
As our blue room, far away upstairs  
  
(They will thrive on, keep alive on,  
Just nothing but kisses  
With mister and missus,  
Own little blue chair  
  
She'll wear her trousseau,  
and Robinson Crusoe)  
Is not so far from worldly cares,  
As our blue room,  
Far away upstairs

My heart is sad an' lonely  
For you I sigh, for you dear only,  
Why haven't you seen it?  
I'm all for you, body an' soul!  
  
I spent my days in longing  
And wondering why it's me you're wronging?  
I tell you I mean it  
I'm all for you, body an' soul!  
  
I can't believe it, it's hard to concede it  
That you turn away romance  
Are you pretending, it looks like the ending  
Unless I could have one more chance  
To prove dear . . .  
  
My life a wreck you're making  
You know I'm yours for just the taking  
I'd gladly surrender myself to you  
Body an' soul!  
  
My life a wreck you're making  
You know I'm yours for just the taking  
I'd gladly surrender myself to you  
Body an' soul!

I'm just breezin' along with the breeze,  
Trailing the rails, I'm a roamin' the seas.  
Like the birdies that sing in the trees,  
Pleasin' to live, livin' to please.  
  
The sky is the only roof I have over my head,  
And when I'm weary, mother nature makes me a bed.  
I'm just goin' along as I please,  
Breezin' along with the breeze.  
  
The sky is the only roof I have over my head,  
And when I'm weary, mother nature makes me a bed.  
I'm just goin' along as I please,  
Breezin' along with the breeze.

When you're weary, feeling small,  
When tears are in your eyes, I'll dry them all,  
I'm at your side,  
Oh! When times get rough,  
And friends just can't be found . . .  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
When you're down an' out, when you're on the street,  
When evening falls so hard, I will comfort you,  
I'll take your part,  
Oh! When darkness comes,  
And pain is all around . . .  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will lay me down!  
Sail on silver girl, sail on by,  
Your time has come to shine, all your dreams are on their way,  
See how they shine,  
Oh! When you need a friend,  
I'm sailing right behind . . .  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will ease your mind!  
Like a bridge over troubled water,  
I will ease your mind!  
Words and Music by Paul Simon  

I got an old slouch hat  
Got my roll on my shoulder  
I'm as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
Got a million friends  
I don't feel any older  
I've got nothing to lose  
Not even the blues  
Just to bumming around  
  
Whenever worries start  
To bothering me  
I grab my coat, my old slouch hat  
Hit the trail again  
  
You see, I ain't got a dime  
Don't care where I'm going  
I'm as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
I hit the trail again  
  
You see, I ain't got a dime  
Don't care where I'm going  
I'm as free as a breeze  
And do as I please  
Just to bumming around  
  
Just to bumming around  
Just to bumming around  
Just to bumming around

Buongiorno Teresa  
Like the sun you brighten up my day  
Good mornin' Teresa  
Smile at me an' send me on my way!  
You sit by the tower,  
The world rushes by,  
Sell me a flower,  
An' straighten my tie!  
I'll walk home this evening  
Through the lonely market place  
I'll sleep well, I'll dream well,  
Because tomorrow I can say "Buongiorno Teresa"  
I love you more each day!  
  
I'll walk home this evening  
Through the lonely market place  
I'll sleep well, I'll dream well,  
Because tomorrow I can say "Buongiorno Teresa"  
I love you more ( I love you more! ) each day!  
Teresa!  
I love you more each day!  
Teresa!  
I love you more each day!

I'll sing to the sun in the sky,  
I'll sing till the sun rises high,  
Carnival time is here,  
Magical time of year,  
And as the time draws near,  
Dreams lift my heart!  
  
I'll sing as I play my guitar,  
I'll cling to a dream from afar,  
Will love come my way,  
This Carnival day,  
And stay here in my heart?  
  
Will true love come my way,  
On this Carnival day,  
Or will I be alone with my dream?

The moon was shining bright in Carolina  
The night we said goodbye so tenderly  
And now that I'm away from Carolina  
Won't somebody tell the moon for me:  
  
Oh, Carolina Moon keep shining  
Shining on the one who waits for me  
Carolina Moon, I'm pining  
Pining for the place I long to be  
  
How I'm hopin' tonight you'll go  
Go to the right window  
Scatter your light  
Say I'm all right please do!  
  
Tell her that I'm blue an' lonely  
Dreamy Carolina Moon!  
  
Tell her that I'm blue an' lonely  
Dreamy Carolina Moon!

[Chorus]  
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket  
Never let it fade away  
Catch a falling star and put it in your pocket  
Save it for a rainy day  
  
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night  
Just in case you feel you want to hold her  
You'll have a pocketful of starlight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For love may come and tap you on the shoulder some starless night  
Just in case you feel you want to hold her  
You'll have a pocketful of starlight  
(Pocketful of starlight, hm,hm,hm,hm,hm,hm)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Save it for a rainy, save it for a rainy, rainy, rainy, day)  
  
For when your troubles start multiplyin' and they just might  
It's easy to forget them without tryin'  
With just a pocketful of starlight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Save it for a rainy day)  
Save it for a rainy day

Oh! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!  
  
But when we kiss, pretty miss, pretty miss, are you thinking of me?  
Caterina  
Ah! Ha! Ha!

Where the jungle trees are tall  
Grows a flower sweet to see  
It's a purdy flower they call "Chincherinchee!"  
There a boy sang all day long  
To a maiden tenderly  
And he called her in his song "Chincherinchee!"  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade  
In the moonlight:  
"Sweet Chincherinchee, you're divine,  
Sweet Chincherinchee say you're mine!  
Say you'll be mine my whole life through!  
Sweet Chincherinchee, I love you!"  
Everyone will agree  
She's as sweet as can be  
She's so kissable and caress-able "Chincherinchee!"  
Everybody can see  
How exciting is she  
She's embraceable, irreplaceable "Chincherinchee!"  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade . . .  
  
Every night they used to meet  
By a tall banyan tree  
Where he sang his heart to sweet "Chincherinchee!"  
While the tom toms played  
He sang his serenade  
In the moonlight:  
"Sweet Chincherinchee, you're divine,  
Sweet Chincherinchee say you're mine!  
Say you'll be mine my whole life through!  
Sweet Chincherinchee, I love you!"  
"Sweet Chincherinchee, you're divine,  
Sweet Chincherinchee say you're mine!  
Say you'll be mine my whole life through!  
Sweet Chincherinchee, I love you!"

It is "He", Christ who is born today  
See Him crying in the manger

Son of God  
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  
  
There He lies  
there with the lam?kin  
Only swaddle for his garment  
With his Holy Mother Mary  
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  
  
Glory, Glory, Almighty God!  
And on Earth,  
Peace to All Men  
Hear the joyful angels singing  
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!  
  
He is born,  
let us adore Him

Christmas bells in the steeple  
Ringing out on Christmas morn'  
But where are all the people  
Where has everybody gone?  
  
They're all busy with their presents  
Snug and warm behind their doors  
Thinkin' no one was forgotten  
Empty shelves in all the stores  
  
Doesn't anyone remember  
As they wake up Christmas morn'  
The 25th day of December  
Little Baby Jesus was born?  
  
Christmas bells in the steeple  
How their ringing seems to say  
O come all ye faithful, get down on your knees and pray  
Don't you know it's Christmas Day?

Watch me now, here I go, all I needs a little snow!  
Starts me off, sets the theme, helps me dream my Christmas dream,  
Every year I dream it, hoping things will change,  
An end to the crying, the shouting, the dying,  
And I hope you will dream it too!  
It's Christmas,  
Remember?  
We've got to remember!  
  
So, light the light, I'm home tonight,  
I need you to warm me, to calm me, to love me!  
To help me to dream my Christmas dream!  
  
Crazy things, said an' done,  
Every single day but one!  
Every night should, I believe,  
Be the same as Christmas Eve,  
Nights should all be silent,  
Days should all slow down,  
An end to the hurry, the noise and the worry!  
And I hope you believe that too!  
It's Christmas,  
Remember?  
Does no one remember?  
  
The whole world needs, a Christmas dream,  
We need it to warm us, to calm us, to love us,  
To help us to dream our Christmas dream!

I'm gonna love you like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain, an' deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
  
I guess when you met me  
It was just one o' those things  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
An' won't it be fine?  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine!  
  
(You're gonna love me like nobody's loved me)  
Come rain or come shine  
(Happy together, unhappy together  
An' won't it be fine?)  
  
Days may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or we're out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine!  
  
(I'm gonna love you...rain...)  
I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you...

Dance, dance, only with me,  
Only with me near your heart  
Dance, dance, cling close to me,  
Never to part!  
Love, love, love only me,  
All of our days from now on  
Dance only with me  
'till all our sweet music is gone!  
  
Love, love, love only me,  
All of our days from now on  
Dance only with me  
'till all our sweet music is gone!  
. . . 'till all our sweet music is gone!

Ho! the band stopped playin'  
An' the couples stopped swayin'  
But we kept on . . . dancin!  
  
The lights went on  
An' the crowd was gone  
But we kept on . . . dancin!  
  
The janitor said, "Please let me sweep the floor!"  
So, I hummed a tune an' we danced right . . .  
through the door!  
  
It started rainin'  
But we both were insane  
An' we kept right . . . on dancin'  
  
We looked a sight  
By the traffic light  
But we . . . kept on dancin'  
  
The signal was red so we just tapped our feet  
When the light turned green  
Well, we danced across the street!  
  
( Couples parked in cars were romancin' )  
They were romancin'  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
( Ba bum ba bum bum' )  
Our clothes were drippin'  
An' we couldn't help slippin'  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
Our feet were sore  
When we reached your door  
But we kept right in dancin!  
  
When I kissed ya goodnight  
My heart started dancin' too  
That's when I knew . . .  
That I would dance my whole life through  
With only you . . .  
  
With only you . . .  
With only you . . .  
My whole life through  
With only you . . .

It takes a certain kind of somethin' special  
Deep in your heart, that's where it starts, deep in your heart  
It takes a certain kind of somethin' special  
Deep in your heart, for love to come your way!  
  
It takes a lot of true consideration  
Deep in your heart, that's where it starts, deep in your heart  
It takes a lot of true consideration  
Deep in your heart, for love to come your way!  
  
It takes a faith and trusting understanding  
Deep in your heart, that's where it starts, deep in your heart  
It takes a faith and trusting understanding  
Deep in your heart, for love to come your way!  
  
. . . for love to come your way!

Sky, so vast as the sky  
With far away clouds just wandering by . . .  
Where did they go?  
Oh I don't know, don't know . . .  
Wind, that speaks to the leaves  
Telling stories that no one believes . . .  
Stories of love  
Belong to you and me . . .  
Oh Dindi . . .  
If I only had words  
I would say all the beautiful things that I see  
When you're with me  
Oh my Dindi!  
Oh Dindi . . .  
Like the song of the wind in the trees  
That's how my heart is singing Dindi, happy Dindi,  
When you're with me!  
I love you more each day,  
Yes I do, yes I do . . .  
I'd let you go away  
If you take me with you!  
Don't you know Dindi . . .  
I'd be running an' searching for you,  
Like a river, that can't find the sea,  
That would be me, without you my Dindi!  
  
Don't you know Dindi . . .  
I'd be running an' searching for you,  
Like a river, that can't find the sea,  
That would be me, without you my Dindi!  
Music by Antonio Carlos Jobim with lyrics by Aloysio De Oliveira  
English lyrics by Ray Gilbert  

There's a song in the air,  
But the fair senorita  
Doesn't seem to care  
For the song in the air.  
So I'll sing to my mule  
If you're sure she won't think that  
I am just a fool  
Serenading a mule.  
  
Amigo mio, does she not have a dainty bray?  
She listens carefully to each little word we play.  
La bella Senorita?  
Si, si, mi muchachito,  
She'd love to sing it too if only she knew the way.  
But try as she may,  
In her voice there's a flaw!  
And all that the lady can say  
Is "E-E-AW!"  
  
There's a light in her eye,  
Tho' she may try to hide it,  
She cannot deny,  
There's a light in her eye.  
Oh! the charm of her smile  
So beguiles all who see her  
That they'd ride a mile  
For the charm of her smile.  
  
Amigo mio, is she listenin' to my song?  
No, no, mi muchachito, how could you be so wrong?  
La bella Senorita?  
Si, Si, la senorita,  
If she knew all the words,  
  
Well, maybe she'd sing along,  
  
Her face is a dream  
Like an angel I saw!  
But all that my darlin' can scream  
Is: "E-E-AW!"  
Senorita donkey sita, not so fleet as a mosquito,  
But so sweet like my Chiquita,  
You're the one for me.  
  
You're, the one, for me!

Fooled, maybe I'm just being fooled  
Maybe I'll be ridiculed but I adore you  
If I'm fooled, then it's heaven being fooled  
For you taught a heart unschooled to live just for you  
  
Those who act cautious and wise  
Never have stars in their eyes  
If I'm in a fool's paradise  
Keep me there for I don't care  
  
If I'm fooled, and my mind is over-ruled  
Still my heart has not been fooled  
'Cause I'll always love you

Don't look so sad, I know it's over,  
But life goes on and this ol' world will keep on turning.  
Let's just be glad we had some time to spend together,  
There's no need to watch the bridges that we're burning.  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow,  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine,  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window,  
And make believe you love me one more time,  
For the good times  
  
I'll get along, you'll find another,  
And I'll be here if you should find you ever need me,  
Don't say a word about tomorrow, or forever,  
There'll be time enough for sadness when you leave me  
  
Lay your head upon my pillow,  
Hold your warm and tender body close to mine,  
Hear the whisper of the raindrops blowing soft across the window,  
And make believe you love me one more time,  
For the good times  
  
For the good times

I've got a lot of memories to last me the rest of my life  
So if you don't want to love me, baby that'll be alright  
I'm gonna take all the lovin' that I have for you  
Gonna take all the loneliness an' sit right down with the blues!  
  
I'm gonna give myself a party, an' serve old memories  
Give my self a party, think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness that once we knew  
Gonna give myself a party, just me an' the blues!  
  
A few of your love letters, a photograph or two  
A gift you gave on my birthday with words of "I love you"  
There's lots of things to think about, when you're feelin' blue  
So I'm gonna take all the loneliness, sit right down with the blues!  
  
I'm gonna give myself a party, an' serve old memories  
Give my self a party, think of how it used to be  
Remember all the happiness that once we knew  
I'm gonna give myself a party, just me an' the blues!  
  
Just me an' the blues!

They were standing in a crowded station,  
So unaware,  
Of all the people there!  
I didn't mean to hear their conversation,  
But anyone could tell,  
It was their last farewell!  
  
Good-bye Sue,  
All the best of luck to you!  
You've been my only gal,  
what's more, my best pal!  
  
Please don't cry,  
Smile until the clouds roll by!  
Don't kiss me dear, just walk away,  
Or I could never ever say,  
Good-bye, good-bye Sue!  
  
(Good-bye Sue) My little Sue!  
(All the best of luck to you!) Good luck to you!  
(You've been my only gal,  
what's more, my best pal!  
My best pal!)  
  
Please don't cry,  
Smile until the clouds roll by!  
Don't kiss me dear, just walk away,  
Or I could never ever say,  
Good-bye, good-bye Sue!

Goodnight, Sweet Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight, Sweet Jesus,  
Guard us in sleep,  
Our souls and bodies,  
In thy love keep . . .  
Waking or sleeping,  
Keep us in sight,  
Dear gentle saviour,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight, Dear Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight Sweet Jesus,  
Pray that each day,  
Of our lives mortal,  
Thus pass away. . .  
Thy love o'er watching,  
Guiding our right,  
Dear gentle saviour,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .  
Goodnight Dear Jesus,  
Goodnight, goodnight . . .

Delighting in your company!  
  
Greensleeves is my delight  
Greensleeves is all my joy  
Greensleeves, my heart of gold  
And who but my lady greensleeves?

To grant whatever you would crave!  
I have both wagered life and land  
Your love and good will for to have!  
  
Greensleeves is my delight

That thou my constant sea may see  
And that yet once before I die  
Thou will doth say to love me!

Happiness comes, happiness goes  
Where it goes, no one knows!  
What's in store, who can guess?  
It could be . . . happiness!  
If you're in love, an' she loves you too  
Oh never break her heart, whatever you may do  
Don't say goodbye ( Don't say goodbye! )  
To a love that's true ( to a love that's true! )  
Because if you should lose your one an' only  
All your life you may be lonely!  
Happiness comes ( Happiness comes! )  
Happiness goes ( happiness goes! )  
Where it goes ( where it goes! )  
No one knows! ( no one knows! )  
What's in store ( What's in store? )  
Who can guess? ( who can guess? )  
It could be . . . happiness!  
  
Happiness comes, happiness goes  
Where it goes, no one knows!

There's a road that someday I'm gonna walk down,  
If I ever find the time!  
I'll dig my toes in that warm and friendly sand,  
And I'll be all through dreamin' yeah,  
Feelin' just like laughin'  
Be a very happy man!  
  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
There's a song that someday I'm gonna sing,  
If I ever find the time!  
And I'll throw back my head and sing just like a songbird,  
And I'll be all through dreamin' yeah,  
Feelin' just like laughin'  
Be a very happy man!  
  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
Time grows short and I haven't done a thing,  
Time grows short for the dreamer and his dream,  
Well a man who won't take a chance,  
He never finds the way,  
But for the dreamer,  
Tomorrow is never today!  
  
( La, la la la, la . . . la la, la la la la! )  
There's a girl that someday I'll say hello to,  
If I ever find the time!  
I'll touch her hair and look into her eyes,  
And I'll be all through dreamin' yeah,  
Feelin' just like laughin'  
Be a very happy man!

Hello, young lovers, whoever you are,  
I hope your troubles are few,  
All my good wishes go with you tonight,  
I've been in love like you.  
  
Be brave, young lovers, and follow your star,  
Be brave, an' faithful, an' true,  
Cling very close to each other tonight,  
I've been in love like you.  
  
I know how it feels,  
To have wings on your heels,  
And to fly down the street in a trance!  
You fly down the street,  
On a chance that you'll meet,  
And you meet, not really by chance.  
  
Don't cry, young lovers, whatever you do,  
Don't cry because I'm alone,  
All of my memories are happy tonight,  
I've had a love of my own.  
  
I've had a love of my own like yours,  
I've had a love of my own!  
I've had a love of my own like yours,  
I've had a love of my own!

Here comes more tears to cry  
Here comes more heartaches by  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
Here comes more misery  
Here comes old memories  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
My arms are open wide  
To let more hurt inside  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
She's sorry once again  
Once more I'll understand  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
My arms are open wide  
To let more hurt inside  
Here comes my baby back again  
  
She's sorry once again  
Once more I'll understand  
Here comes my baby back again

Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody won't end  
Here comes that song again  
  
There's a tender song inside me  
Only your sweet voice can play  
I heard it once but it disappeared  
On the day you went away  
  
As time slipped by  
I thought that I'd forgotten all the lines  
But then last night we met again  
And I heard them one more time  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody won't end  
Here comes that song again  
  
With the early mornin' raindrops  
Dancin' on my window pane  
You hold me and I hear my song  
Keepin' time with the fallin' rain  
  
Now, I don't know what made you go  
Or brought you back last night  
I only know my love for you  
Is a song that feels so right  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms, I hear the words begin  
They promise this time the melody won't end  
Here comes that song again  
  
Here comes that song again  
Soft in your arms I hear the words begin  
They promise this time  
The melody won't end

Oh, there's no place like home for the holidays,  
'Cause no matter how far away you roam,  
When you pine for the sunshine of a friendly gaze,  
For the holidays, you can't beat home, sweet home.  
  
I met a man who lives in Tennessee,  
He was headin' for,  
Pennsylvania, and some home made pumpkin pie.  
From Pennsylvania, folks are travelin'  
Down to Dixie's sunny shore,  
From Atlantic to Pacific,  
Gee, the traffic is terrific.  
  
Oh there's no place like home for the holidays,  
'Cause no matter how far away you roam,  
If you want to be happy in a million ways,  
For the holidays,  
You can't beat home, sweet home.  
  
Take a bus, take a train  
Go and hop an aeroplane  
Put the wife and kiddies in the family car  
For the pleasure that you bring  
When you make that doorbell ring  
No trip could be too far

I believe, for every drop of rain that falls,  
A flower grows...  
  
I believe that somewhere in the darkest night,  
A candle glows...  
  
I believe for everyone who goes astray,  
Someone will come, to show the way,  
I believe, I believe...  
  
I believe, above the storm the smallest prayer,  
Will still be heard...  
  
I believe, that someone in the great somewhere,  
Hears every word...  
  
Everytime I hear a newborn baby cry,  
Or touch a leaf, or see the sky,  
Then I know why, I believe!  
  
I believe, above the storm the smallest prayer,  
Will still be heard . . .

I believe in music,  
I believe in love, love, love!  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
  
Well I can just sit around makin' music all day long,  
Long as I'm makin' music, I can't do nobody no wrong!  
And who knows maybe someday I'll come up with a song,  
That makes people want to stop their fussin' an' fightin'  
Long enough to sing along!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .

I believe in love!  
  
Music is love, love is music, if you know what I mean,  
People who believe in music are the happiest people I've ever seen!  
So clap your hands an' stomp your feet, shake your tambourine,  
( Lift your voices to the sky ) God loves you when you sing!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
  
Music is the universal language and love is the key,  
To brotherhood an' peace an' understandin' to live in harmony!  
So, take your brothers by the hand and sing along with me,  
Find out what it really means to be young, rich an' free!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love!  
I believe in music,  
I believe in love . . .  
  
Words and Music by  
Mac Davis , 1972

Whenever skies look gray to me,  
And trouble begins to brew  
Whenever the winter winds become too strong,  
I concentrate on you!  
  
When fortune cries nay nay to me,  
And people declare you're through,  
Whenever the blues become my only song,  
I concentrate on you!  
  
On your smile, so sweet, so tender,  
When at first my kiss you declined  
On the light in your eyes, when you surrender,  
And once again our arms intertwine  
And so when wise men say to me,  
That loves' young dream never comes true,  
To prove that even wise men can be wrong,  
I concentrate on you!  
I concentrate, I concentrate,  
On you!

I confess to have a willingness and wanting for you  
To have you here by me, near by me, all my life through  
  
You run around  
You run around  
Run around, baby  
Run around, baby  
Some day, maybe  
We'll have a love  
  
Someday you say, yeah, someday you may  
Be my girl  
Hand in hand we walk, through the land we walk  
Around the world  
But right now  
But right now  
  
You run around  
You run around  
Run around, baby  
Run around, baby  
Some day, maybe  
We'll have a love  
  
You'll be with me 'til eternity  
And be mine  
Sent from above, will be my love 'til  
The end of time  
But right now  
But right now  
  
You run around  
You run around  
Run around, baby  
Run around, baby  
Some day, maybe  
We'll have a love  
  
I confess to have a willingness and wanting for you  
To have you here by me, near by me, all my life through

I don't see me in your eyes anymore,  
oh why can't I make them shine as before?  
I don't see you or your heart in your kiss,  
when you should sigh that your mine, you resist!  
  
There was a time life was fine, love was ecstasy  
but now I doubt what the outcome will be!  
I pray you'll say I'm the one you adore  
then I'll see me in your eyes as before!  
  
I pray you'll say I'm the one you adore  
Then I'll see me in your eyes as before!

I gotta right to sing the blues, I gotta right to feel low-down,  
I gotta right t' hang around, down around the river . . .  
  
A certain gal in this ol' town, keeps draggin' my poor heart around,  
All I see for me, is misery . . .  
  
I gotta right to sing the blues, I gotta right to moan and sigh,  
I gotta right to sit and cry, down around the river . . .  
  
I kno' the deep blue sea, will soon be callin' me,  
It must be love, say what you choose,  
I gotta right to sing the blues! (doo doo, doo doo doo, doo doo, doo doo doo)  
  
(He's gotta right to sing the blues) I gotta right to sing the blues!  
(He's gotta right to moan and sigh) I gotta right t' moan and sigh!  
(He's gotta right to sit an' cry) sit an' cryin' down along the river!  
  
I kno' the deep blue sea, will soon be callin' me,  
It must be love, say what you choose,  
I gotta right to sing the blues . . . the blues,  
I gotta right (the right!) tonight (tonight!)  
I gotta right to sing the blues! (doo doo, doo doo, doo wah!)

I had the craziest dream last night, yes I did!  
I never dreamed it could be,  
Yet there you were, in love with me.  
  
I found your lips close to mine, so I kissed you,  
And you didn't mind it at all!  
When I'm awake, such a break never happens,  
How long can a guy go on dreamin'?  
  
If there's a chance that you care, then please,  
Say you do Baby!  
Say it and make my craziest dream come true.

( I Know, I know, oh yes, I know! )  
I know what it means  
To be lost in the dark!  
I know what it means  
To be tossed by the storm!  
I have walked alone  
With a heart of stone  
And despair too heavy for tears,  
But you caught my heart  
And you taught my heart  
To forget it's doubts and fear!  
And now that I know  
The joy of your love  
My head is high, I can face the sky  
And know that heaven is here below,  
I know . . .  
For you I could die,  
For you I will live,  
I know!  
( I Know, I know, I know! )

I have heard the wild bird's sing  
So I know what "freedom" is  
I have looked into the eyes of a child  
So I know what "faith" is  
I have seen a rainbow  
So I know what "beauty" is  
I have planted a tree  
So I know what "hope" is  
I have held a helping hand  
So I know what "kindness" is  
I have seen a blossom burst into bloom  
So I know what "glory" is  
I have lost a friend  
So I know what "sorrow" is  
I have knelt down in prayer  
So I know what "peace" is  
I have seen a mother at her crib  
So I'm sure of the meaning of "love"  
I have seen and I have felt these things  
And now I know what "God" is!

You looked back to see if I looked back,  
And I looked back to see if you looked back  
To see if I looked back to see  
If you were lookin' at me!  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
When you looked back I felt my heart strings snap,  
And heard a thunder clap  
And saw the lightning striking at me!  
Then I stood still, an' you stood still,  
The world stood still, my heart stood still,  
And O' the thrill that suddenly we knew,  
The very, very moment . . .  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin' at you!  
  
Then I stood still, an' you stood still,  
The world stood still, my heart stood still,  
And O' the thrill that suddenly we knew,  
The very, very moment . . .  
I looked back to see if you looked back,  
And you looked back to see if I looked back  
To see if you looked back to see  
If I was lookin' at you!  
( . . . to see if you were lookin' at me! )  
To see if I was lookin' at you, lookin' at me,  
Lookin' at you . . . lookin' at me!

I may be wrong but I think you're wonderful  
I may be wrong but I think you're swell  
  
I like your style, say, I think you're marvelous  
But I can't see, so how can I tell?  
  
All of my shirts are unsightly, all of my ties are a crime  
If dear in you I've picked rightly, it's the very first time  
  
You came along, say, I think you're wonderful  
I think you're grand but I may be wrong  
  
I may be wrong but I think you're swell  
But I can't see, so how can I tell?  
  
All of my shirts are unsightly, all of my ties are a crime  
If dear in you I've picked rightly, it's the very first time  
  
You came along, say, I think you're wonderful  
I think you're grand but I may be wrong

I'm sleepin' an' right in the middle of a good dream  
Like all at once I wake up  
From somethin' that keeps knockin' at my brain  
Before I go insane  
  
I hold my pillow to my head  
An' spring up in my bed  
Screamin' out the words I dread  
I think I love you  
(I think I love you)  
  
This mornin', I woke up with this feelin'  
I didn't know how to deal with  
An' so I just decided to myself  
I'd hide it to myself  
  
An' never talk about it  
An' didn't I go and shout it  
When you walked into my room  
I think I love you  
(I think I love you)  
  
I think I love you  
So what am I so afraid of?  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of  
A love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you  
Isn't that what life is made of?  
Though it worries me to say  
That I never felt this way  
  
I don't know what I'm up against?  
I don't know what it's all about?  
I got so much to think about  
  
Hey, I think I love you  
So what am I so afraid of?  
I'm afraid that I'm not sure of  
A love there is no cure for  
  
I think I love you  
Isn't that what life is made of?  
Though it worries me to say  
That I never felt this way  
  
Believe me  
You really didn't have to worry  
I only wanna make ya happy  
An' if you say, "Hey, go away"  
  
I will  
But I think better  
Still, I'd better stay around an' love you  
Do you think I have a chance?  
  
Let me ask you to your face  
Do you think you love me?  
I think I love you  
  
(Do you think you love me?)  
I think I love you  
(Do you think you love me?)  
I think I love you  
(Do you think you love me?)  
I think I love you

When I'm alone at night,  
And there's no one to comfort me,  
I think of you  
And suddenly my pillow is your face and your arms.  
And when the winter wind comes chasin' after me,  
I think of you  
And it's as though I crawl beneath the blanket  
Soft and warm.  
  
How did I get from dark to daylight,  
Before you happened to pass by?  
How did I find my way through life,  
Before you brightened up my sky?  
Was there a sky at all,  
Until you painted it for me?  
How did I get on,  
'Till you came along?  
  
Who knows how many times I pause in every day,  
To think of you?  
As often as the sun sails out upon the silent sea!  
And if you're wonderin' why it is I only think of you,  
Well it's because I'd like to be as close to you,  
As you've become to me!  
I think of you  
I think of you

I thought about walkin'  
Thought about talkin'  
Thought about singin'  
Singin' the blues!  
  
Thought about cryin'  
Once, I even thought of dyin'  
But, baby, most of all  
I thought about you!  
  
Thought of just bein'  
People I'm seein'  
Thought about doin'  
The things that they do  
  
Thought about livin'  
Thought about forgivin'  
But, baby, most of all  
I thought about you!  
  
Thought about just bein'  
People I'm seein'  
Thought about doin'  
The things that they do  
  
Thought about livin'  
Thought about forgivin'  
But, baby, most of all  
I thought about you!  
  
But, baby, most of all  
Yes, I thought about you!  
Thought about you

I wanna give  
I wanna give my love to you completely  
I beg of you  
I beg of you to listen to my heart  
I've never prayed like this before  
And I'm askin' you not to close the door  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me  
I've never prayed like this before  
And I'm askin' you not to close the door  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me  
I wanna give  
I wanna give you all the strength within me  
To make a world  
To make a world that cannot fall apart  
And you can sit upon a throne  
Oh, I'll give it all just for you alone  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me  
And you can sit upon a throne  
Oh, I'll give it all just for you alone  
For I can tame the wind and smooth the waters  
If you just let me  

If I'm lucky, you will tell me that you care,  
That we'll never be apart  
If I'm lucky, this will be no light affair,  
It's forever, from the start  
  
If I'm lucky, there'll be moonbeams all around,  
Shining bright as day  
You will hold my hand and you'll understand,  
All I cannot seem to say  
  
If I am lucky, there will be a time an' place  
You will kiss me, we'll embrace  
In that moment, every wishful dream I ever knew  
Will come true  
  
If I'm lucky, I will go through the years with you  
If I am lucky, there will be a time an' place  
You will kiss me, we'll embrace  
In that moment, every wishful dream I ever knew  
Will come true  
  
If I'm lucky, I will go through the years with you

If there is someone lovelier than you  
Then I am blind, a man without a mind  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
  
But no, I'm not blind, my eyes have traveled everywhere  
In hopes that I might find, a creature half so fair  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all that's beautiful, such beauty can't be true!  
  
If there is someone lovelier than you  
By all that's beautiful, such beauty can't be true!

We'll just be the same old friends  
If we can't be the same old sweethearts  
Then we'll just be the same old friends  
For I want someone like you just to tell my troubles to  
My happiness on you, it all depends  
  
For I've known you too long to forget you  
And my old dream of love never ends  
Though I know you can't be mine  
We will meet from time to time  
And we'll just be the same old friends  
  
For I've known you too long to forget you  
And my old dream of love never ends  
Though I know you can't be mine  
We will meet from time to time  
And we'll just be the same old friends

I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
Some fellows look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
Some fellows make a winning sometimes  
I never even make a gain  
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows  
Waiting to find a little bluebird in vain  
  
I'm always chasing rainbows  
Watching clouds drifting by  
My schemes are just like all my dreams  
Ending in the sky  
Some fellows look and find the sunshine  
I always look and find the rain  
Some fellows make a winning sometimes  
I never even make a gain  
Believe me, I'm always chasing rainbows  

I'm gonna love that girl  
Like she's never been loved before,  
I'm gonna show that girl  
She's the fella that I adore.  
When she's in my arms again,  
Our dreams will all come true,  
The years between might never have been,  
We'll start our lives anew,  
I'm gonna kiss that girl  
Like she's never been kissed before,  
And tho' I miss that girl,  
She's the fella I'm waitin' for  
We'll never part again,  
She'll hold my heart again  
Forever and ever more  
I'm gonna love that girl  
Like she's never been loved before.

I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna write words so sweet  
They're gonna knock me off my feet  
A lot of kisses on the bottom  
I'll be glad I got them  
  
I'm gonna smile and say  
"I hope you're feelin' better"  
And close with love  
The way you do  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you  
  
I'm gonna sit right down  
And write myself a letter  
And make believe it came from you

I come to the garden alone,  
While the dew is still on the roses,  
And the voice I hear falling on my ear,  
The Son of God discloses  
  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other, has ever, known!  
  
He speaks and the sound of His voice,  
Is so sweet the birds hush their singing,  
And the melody that he gave to me,  
Within my heart is ringing  
  
And He walks with me, and He talks with me,  
And He tells me I am His own,  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other, has ever, known!  
  
And the joy we share as we tarry there,  
None other, has ever, known!

( in these crazy times,  
How very sweet to know,  
Our love is like the love of long ago . . .  
In these crazy times,  
When life is wild and strange,  
Our feelings for each other never change . . . )  
Old things make way for new things,  
Yet we still cling to the true things,  
We will always be ruled by the heart!  
In these crazy times,  
When rockets fly in space,  
When quick success is all they're dreaming of,  
How blessed we are with our love!  
( old things make way for new things,  
Yet we still cling to the true things . . . )  
We will always be ruled by the heart!

How blessed we are with our love!  
( in these crazy, crazy times! )  

Lovers depend on moonlight for a love affair  
Babies depend on mothers for their tender care  
Flowers depend on sunshine and the morning dew  
Each thing depends on something and I depend on you  
  
I can be happy, I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad, it all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble, I can be proud, it all depends on you  
  
I can save money or spend it, go right on living or end it  
You're to blame, honey, for what I do  
I know that I can be beggar, I can be queen  
I can be almost any old thing, it all depends on you  
  
I can be happy, I can be sad  
I can be good or I can be bad, it all depends on you  
I can be lonely out in a crowd  
I can be humble, I can be proud, it all depends on you  
  
I can save money or spend it, go right on living or end it  
You're to blame, honey, for what I do  
I know that I can be beggar, I can be queen  
I can be almost any old thing, it all depends on you

Hide your heart from sight,  
Lock your dreams at night,  
It could happen to you!  
Don't count stars or you might stumble,  
Someone drops a sigh and down you tumble  
  
Keep an eye on spring,  
Run when church bells ring,  
It could happen to you!  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be,  
And it happened to me  
  
It could happen to you  
All I did was wonder how your arms would be,  
And it happened to me

It happened in Monterey, a long time ago,  
I met her in Monterey, in ol' Mexico.  
Stars an' steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine,  
Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine.  
  
It happened in Monterey, without thinkin' twice,  
I left her an' threw away the key to Paradise.  
My indiscreet heart, longs for a sweetheart,  
That I left in ol' Monterey!  
  
( It happened in Monterey, a long time ago,  
He met her in Monterey, in old Mexico. )  
Stars and steel guitars and luscious lips as red as wine,  
Broke somebody's heart and I'm afraid that it was mine.  
  
( It happened in Monterey, without thinking twice )  
I left her an' threw away the key to Paradise.  
My indiscreet heart, longs for a sweetheart,  
That I left in ol' Monterey!

It's impossible, tell the sun to leave the sky, it's just impossible  
It's impossible, ask a baby not to cry, it's just impossible  
Can I hold you closer to me and not feel you goin' through me?  
Split the second that I never think of you? Oh, how impossible  
  
Can the ocean keep from rushin' to the shore? It's just impossible  
If I had you, could I ever want for more? It's just impossible  
And tomorrow, should ya ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it  
I would sell my very soul and not regret it  
For to live without your love--It's just impossible  
  
Can the ocean keep from rushin' to the shore? It's just impossible  
If I had you, could I ever want for more? It's just impossible  
And tomorrow, shouldya ask me for the world, somehow I'd get it  
I would sell my very soul and not regret it  
For to live without your love,  
It's just impossible  
  
Impossible, impossible
