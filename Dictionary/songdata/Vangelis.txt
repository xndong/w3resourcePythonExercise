"Do you like our owl?"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"Is it artificial?"  
  
[Rachel:]  
"Of course it is"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"Must be expensive"  
  
[Rachel:]  
"very"  
  
[Rachel:]  
"I'm Rachel"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"Deckard"  
  
[Rachel:]  
"Its seems you feel our work is not a benefit to the public"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"Replicants are like any other machines"  
  
"They are either a benefit or a hazard"  
  
"If they're a benefit, it's not my problem"  
  
[Rachel:]  
"May I ask you a personal question?"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"sure"  
  
[Rachel:]  
"Have you ever retired a human, by mistake?"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"No" [Rachel:]  
"but in your position that is a risk"  
  
[Tyrell:]  
"Is this to be an empathy test?"  
  
"Capilary dilation of the so called blush response"  
"... fluctuation of the pupil"  
"Involuntary dilation of the iris"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"We call it Voight-Kampf for short"  
[note: named after the people who developed this test]  
  
[Rachel:]  
"Mr. Deckard, Dr. Elden Tyrell"  
  
[Tyrell:]  
"Demonstrate it. I want to see it work"  
  
[Deckard:]  
"Were is the subject?"  
  
[Tyrell:]  
"I want to see it work on a person"  
"I want to see a negative before I provide you with a positive"  
  
[Deckard:]

[Tyrell:]  
"Indulge me"  
  
[Deckard:] "on you?"

Come to me  
While I'm sleeping,  
So their wagging tongues  
Might not find you, my love!  
  
All the while  
They lie down,  
Our lighter souls fuse,  
Fly and dive, my love.  
  
So, stamp this night so strong,  
That I will remember  
And have it ever after!  
  
Come to me  
In my dreaming,  
So their wagging tongues  
Might not find you, my love!  
  
'Round the corner,  
Back of hands,  
They'll still be talking  
Whether or not we'd ever,  
Whether we'd ever, my love.

I can't take it any more  
I can't take it any more  
I can't take it any more  
I can't take it any more  
  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
  
I can't take it any more  
Can you take it any more?  
Can you take it any more?  
Can we take it any more?  
Can we take it any more?  
  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
  
Ha, ha, ha  
Ha, ha, ha  
Ha, ha...  
  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud, too loud  
Too loud...

After the first embrace from you my senses knew  
The look of love was in your eyes  
And after we first make love  
Our senses tingle to the touch  
Oh, how we hypnotize  
  
Oh, to get the feeling on and on  
Oh, just to get the feeling  
  
Holding you closer in my arms we drift to heaven  
Bringing in the morning light  
And after all is said and done there's only us  
We can make it right  
  
So, our love will carry on and on  
Now our love will be free, be free  
  
And when we play, love don't delay, I hear you now  
For what was then, is what is now, anyhow  
As I became a guest of love's tune here again  
We'll carry on together like today  
  
After the first embrace from you I want you too  
After the first embrace from you I want you too

I've seen things...  
So many things that you can't believe,  
Past designs, future designs,  
Cables in the bend.  
  
Second-hand sounds,  
Future sounds,  
Synthesised dialogues,  
Incomprehenseble software.  
  
Hi Jon, let's break some rules!  
Here comes the sun.  
  
We're doing some recordings later  
Same ol' factory you know  
Here's some names for you,  
Polyester Landscape,  
Nylon Oxygen,  
Ashes to Concrete.  
  
Oh, by the way,  
It's been a beautiful morning,  
What a morning,  
Great morning,  
It's a great morning man.

Let it happen  
Honey don't you live on the edge of your life  
Let it happen  
Honey don't you live on the edge of a sigh  
Let it happen  
Honey don't you live on the edge of a smile  
Let it happen  
Honey don't you live on the edge of your time  
Baby all you got to do  
Is let the rhythm get to you  
  
Baby all you got to do  
Is let the rhythm get to you  
  
Let it happen  
Honey take a ride on the wheel of life  
Let it happen  
Open up your heart to the wheel of life  
Let it happen  
You can put your trust to the wheel of life  
Let it happen  
Throw away your fear on the wheel of life  
Baby all you got to do  
Is let the rhythm get to you  
Baby all you got to do  
Is let the rhythm get to you

All you need is love on the wheel of life  
All you need is love on the wheel of life  
All you need is love on the wheel of life

Losing sleep  
In a waking dream  
  
A recurring face I see  
Comes to pass my way  
  
Still, my heart  
Will you please be still, my heart  
In this world of change  
You keep turning me 'round again  
  
In my mind  
Could it be that I'm just a fool for love?  
Is blind to danger  
  
Is this faith?  
Then why should I  
Hesitate when love would dance with a stranger?  
  
Shout it loud from the rooftop high  
Let it burn inside  
And try only to fade and die  
  
If I knew all there was to learn  
Every twist and turn  
Why do I still try?

Years passing by

And again  
Years passing by

Let her stay

Gets a machine

Get the bass

Shine for me  
I'll shine for you  
Each waking dawn  
Each day  
Let these words  
Please, let this song  
Take you so  
Completely  
You have the gift of love  
You have the gift of life  
Take whatever you need  
Be the light  
For once, be sure  
Be the light you are  
You are the sound of love  
You are the sound of life  
Take whatever you need  
More will come as you reopen  
All your senses changing  
Once you have seen  
Be awake to this life song  
Shine for me  
I'll shine for you  
Each waking dawn  
Each day  
You are the gift of love  
You are the gift of life  
Take whatever you need

State of life, may I live? May I love?  
Coming out the sky, I name me a name  
  
Coming out-silver word-what it is  
It is the very nature of the sound the game  
Siamese, Indionese. To Tibet treat the life  
As a game, if you please  
  
(Hey)  
  
Coming up, Carabi, this sense of freedom  
Derives from a mediative state  
  
Movin' on, 'believe' that's it, call it magic  
Third world, it is, I only guessed it  
  
Shablam idi shablam ida  
Shablam idi shablam ida  
Shablam idi shablam ida  
  
Shot to the soul-the flame of Oroladin  
The essence of the word  
The 'state of independence'  
  
Sounds like a signal from you  
Bring me to meet your sound  
And I will bring you to my heart  
  
Love like a signal you call  
Touching my body, my soul  
Bring to me, you to meet me here  
  
Home be the temple of your heart  
Home be the body of your love  
Just like holy water to my lips  
  
(hey, hey)  
Yes I do know how I survive  
(yes I do know) know why I'm alive  
To love and be with you  
Day by day by day by day  
  
(hey, hey)  
Say-aye yaya oh  
(yayah yaya oh)  
'be the sound of higher love' today  
  
(yayah)  
(hey, hey)  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all-in his wisdom-hear  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
Time, time again, it is said  
We will hear, we will see  
See it all-in his wisdom-hear  
His truth will abound the land  
This truth will abound the land  
  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be  
This state of independence shall be

Hi ga Kureru

The day falls into the twilight.  
It is a magic of time.  
The same time tomorrow,  
there'll be another magic.  
It is when colors turn to flavors,  
and flavors turn to colors.  
And it is when  
shadows melt into deep blue....
