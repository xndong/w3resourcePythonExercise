You've been alone  
You've been afraid  
I've been a fool  
In so many ways  
But I would change my life  
If you thought you might try to love me  
  
So please give me another chance  
To write you another song  
Take back those things I've done  
'Cause I'll give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
  
I'm not a saint  
I'm just a man  
Who had heaven and earth in the palm of his hand  
But I threw it away  
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness  
And if you could just  
  
Please, give me another chance  
To write you another song  
Take back those things I've done  
'Cause I'll give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
  
Little girl, you're all I've got  
Don't you leave me standing here once again  
'Cause I'll give you my life (yes I would)  
If you would let me try to love you  
  
So please give me another chance  
To write you another song  
And take back those things I've done  
'Cause I'll give you my heart  
If you would let me start all over again  
Again, oh  
No no  
Oh oh  
  
You know I love you (yeah)  
Give me one more chance  
No no  
No no no no

Love feels lost  
Where is it to be found?  
My heart is still here  
We have to go around and around  
In all the time  
I was loving you faithfully  
And you took my love  
And you turn around on me  
Now I don't wanna fight with you  
I got everything I can do  
Don't you leave me like that, I just want my girl back  
Let me work it out for it is over  
What are we doing?  
What can we see to work it out?  
What are we doing?  
Can we forget what love was about?  
Feels like I'm losing, when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
It's hard to let go  
Girl we ment through so many things  
But for you to grow, have to go on and spring your wings  
I see your tear, you surce for a pride of day  
You should have hold it through  
When you gave my love away  
Now I don't wanna fight with you  
I got everything I can do  
Had to leave it like that, but my thought Imma back  
We tried to work it out  
But it's over  
What are we doing?  
What can we see to work it out?  
What are we doing?  
Can we forget what love was about?  
Feels like I'm losing, when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
Girl it's just too much for me to say  
You were tell me that you love me  
And now I watch you walk away  
But girl the way you fight

That's way I spend it this way  
No, what else to say?  
But girl you know that I still love you, yeah

Can we forget what love was about?  
Feels like I'm losing, when it was everything to me  
And now I realize  
Were just better not together  
I realize  
Were just better not together

I think my heart might explode  
Cause now I feel the weight  
Of your love on me now  
From my head down to my toes  
Cause I can't handle nothin' else  
  
I'm starring at the mirror at these clothes  
That is funny, they mean about as much as yesterday  
Something is calling me home, me home  
I can hear your voice and I'm not afraid  
  
Now I know I'm just a girl  
Trying to make my way through this life  
Now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Like a speeding bullet  
Trying to make my way back through the night  
And now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Boy, I'll take care of the storm  
Let's sneek right pass the cloud of where it sworn  
And I can handle the people  
There just pebble's on the long, long road  
  
I'm starring at the sky at those stars  
And it's funny, they seem about as far as tomorrow  
Something is calling me home, me home  
And I'm not afraid no  
  
Cause I can see everything from high above  
The Earth is a little place next to my love  
I can be strong here where you are  
Just look for me in the sky, I'm not that far  
  
Now I know I'm just a girl  
Trying to make my way through this life  
Now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Like a speeding bullet  
Trying to make my way back through the night  
And now I feel bigger then the world  
With your hand in mine  
  
Now I feel bigger then the trees  
That holds the leaves  
Bigger then the mountains  
That touch the see  
Bigger then the night  
That needs to stay  
Bigger then the waves  
That crash the bay  
  
Bigger oh ooh, bigger oh ooh  
Bigger oh ooh, oh oh ooh

Why can't I see you?  
Stuck in black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you?  
I've been struck by blindness  
  
I close my eyes cause you've been gone  
Such a long time I fantasize  
You close so long fantasy  
Began to see it altered my mind  
Am I crazy?  
When I open my eyes  
Then world was gone  
Reached out when I heard you call my name  
But all I felt was cold  
  
Tell me why can't I see you?  
I'm stuck in black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you?  
I've been struck by blindness  
  
If I close and concentrate  
You illuminate your body slide  
And I let you do the worst mistake  
It's clear as day  
But I can't wrap my mind around it baby  
And when I open my eyes  
Then world is gone, long gone, long gone  
Reached out when I heard you call my name  
But all I felt was cold  
  
Tell me why can't I see you?  
I'm stuck in black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you?  
I've been struck by blindness  
  
Oh, tell me why can't I see you?  
It's like I'm stuck in black and white  
And you're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you? yeah  
I've been struck by blindness  
Why can't I see you?  
In black and white  
You're in technical brightness  
Why can't I see you? Yeah  
I've been struck by blindness  
Blindness, blindness  
Blindness, blindness  
Blindness, blindness

Know 'cause I'm not looking for a change. 'cause I got friends and enemies  
But it just don't bother me, 'cause as long as I believe I can breath.

Moon the Sorceress, Swollen Members an my girl nf, the predators  
And the terminators the tribe cold breath why we hurt em later we  
Do so much damage now. They'll truck em, when I hit them, so much  
Garbage around yells, bells and whistles like carnival sounds  
Phenominal adrenaline from words of my mouth.

Famished and stacked your playin with the praying mantis infact you  
Gigantic you sink like titanic panic attack act up and I'm a? Crash into

Messin up your mental state, we makin ends glow

[Verse 1]  
I got this feeling inside my bones  
It goes electric, wavy when I turn it on  
All through my city, all through my home  
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I got that sunshine in my pocket  
Got that good song in my feet  
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally  
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the lights when everything goes  
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close  
When we move, well, you already know  
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine  
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance  
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you  
So just dance, dance, dance, come on  
All those things I should do to you  
But you dance, dance, dance  
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing

So just dance, dance, dance

So just dance, dance, dance, come on  
  
[Verse 2]  
Ooh, it's something magical  
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on  
I don't need no reason, don't need control  
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket  
Got that good song in my feet  
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops  
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally  
You gon' like the way we rock it, so don't stop  
  
[Chorus]  
Under the lights when everything goes  
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close  
When we move, well, you already know  
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine  
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance  
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you  
So just dance, dance, dance, come on  
All those things I should do to you

The old me, is dead and gone, dead and gone  
  
Ever had one of dem days, you wish woulda' stayed home  
Run into a group of niggas, getting they hate on  
You walk by, they get wrong you reply  
Then shit get blown  
Way outta proportion, way past discussion  
Just you against them, pick one then rush 'em  
Figure you'll get jumped  
That next, they don't wanna stop  
There now they bussin', now you gushin', ambulance  
Rushin' you to the hospital, with a bad concussion  
Plus ya hit four times, plus it hit ya  
Spine paralyzed waist down, now ya wheel chair bound  
Never mind that now, you lucky to be alive,  
Just think it all started you, fussin' with three guys  
Now ya pride in the way, but ya pride is the way you  
Could fuck around, get shot die any day  
Niggas die, every day all over  
Bull shit dope money dice, game ordinary hood shit  
Could this be, 'cause of hip hop music  
Or did the ones, with the good sense  
Not use it, usually niggas  
Don't know what to do, when their back against the wall  
So they just start shootin'  
For red or for blue or for blo' I guess,  
From Bankhead or from your projects  
No more stress, now I'm straight,  
Now I get it now I take time to think,  
Before I make mistakes, just for my family's sake  
That part of me left yesterday, the heart of me is strong today  
No regrets I'm blessed to say, the old me dead and gone away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I ain't never been scared, I live through tragedy  
Situation coulda been dead, lookin' back at it  
Most of that shit, didn't even have to happen  
But you don't think about it, when you out there trappin'  
In apartments hangin', smokin' and rappin'  
Niggas start shit didn't, next thing ya know we cappin'  
Get locked up, then didn't even get mad  
Now think about damn, what a life I had  
Most of that shit, look back just laugh  
Some shit, still look back just sad  
Maybe my homeboy, till be around  
Had I not, hit the nigga  
In the mouth that time, I won that fight, I lost that war  
I can still see my nigga, walkin' out that door  
Who'da thought I'd never see, Philant no more  
Got enough dead homies, I don't want no more  
Cost a nigga his job, cost me more  
Ida took that ass-whoopin', now for sure  
Now think before I risk my life  
Take them chances to get my stripe  
A nigga put his hands on me alright  
Otherwise stand there, talk shit all night  
Cause I hit you, you sue me,  
I shoot you, get locked up, who me?  
No more stress, now I'm straight,  
Now I get it now I take  
Time to think, before I make mistakes  
Just for my family's sake  
That part of me left yesterday  
The heart of me is strong today  
No regrets I'm blessed to say  
The old me dead and gone away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I turn my head to the east  
I don't see nobody by my side  
I turn my head to the west  
Still nobody in sight  
So I turn my head to the north,  
Swallow that pill  
That they call pride  
The old me is dead and gone,  
But the new me will be alright  
I turn my head to the east  
I don't see nobody by my side  
I turn my head to the west  
Still nobody in sight  
So I turn my head to the north,  
Swallow that pill  
That they call pride  
The old me is dead and gone,  
But the new me will be alright  
  
[Chorus]

Oh my, this beat in my heart  
Just in the dark but you're lightning my eyes  
Said I watch you ignite in fire  
And you got a power  
You're damn right  
This life I did  
Not gonna make it if you don't connect tonight right  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
You're reaching my heart fast  
You're searching for something  
That's just how electricity behaves  
Now I need it in somewhere  
The others don't last  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
Glow as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Love won't die  
So what you're giving me girl  
That energy giving  
You know how it goes sometimes  
Love won't die  
Love won't die  
But if you need it girl  
I got energy come and get it  
Sometimes I need to give a little  
Get a little, forget a little  
We could meet any place  
I... You got the power  
Baby you know if you ever go  
And you're back into the light  
  
Stars tried all night  
Body moves lightweight  
You're reaching my heart fast  
You're searching for something  
That's just how electricity behaves  
And I've been needing it so bad  
The others don't last  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
I should've known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady  
  
Wait a minute I'm feeling charged  
I should've known as you glow in the dark  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady uuh  
Wait a minute, I'm to the drops  
I feel it on we get closer till we shock  
You turn it on as I touch you to the sparks  
Electric lady

If you missed the train I'm on  
You will know that I am gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,  
A hundred miles, a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
Lord, I'm one, Lord, I'm two,  
Lord, I'm three, Lord, I'm four  
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home  
  
Away from home, away from home,  
Away from home, away from home  
Lord, I'm five hundred miles away from home  
  
[Instrumental]  
  
Not a shirt on my back  
Not a penny to my name  
Lord, I can't go back home this ole way  
  
This ole way, this ole way,  
This ole way, this ole way,  
Lord, I can't go back home this this ole way  
  
If you missed the train I'm on  
You will know that I am gone  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
  
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,  
A hundred miles, a hundred miles,  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles  
You can hear the whistle blow a hundred miles

I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
  
Now I done banged a heap of Betties in various modes of transport  
'n told them as they exit be sure that they close the damn door  
The quiet country types is usually those I'm scared for[??]  
Some scared at first, but usually those demand more  
Really ain't conceited, I just call myself the cutterbug  
A horny little parasite that all the women love to love  
Tell you what it is today, I ain't concerned with what it was  
Bubba fixin' to get it done, I put that on my brother??  
Hear them in the closet, in the kitchen, justa whisperin'  
Bubba so psst psst knowing that I'm listening  
I ain't gotta chain, boy my peck[?] is all that's glistenin'  
Whachu steamin' on folk, y'all ain't even disciplined  
I ain't leaving nothin', this the house me and my people built  
Huggin' me and dappin' me, buddy I can see your guilt  
It's cold when you're wrong and you lookin' like you need a quilt  
Y'all matter less everytime this margarita tilt  
  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
  
A lot of y'all was thinkin' that Bubba would probably disappear  
Get some show money from ugly and buy a keg of beer  
And another pig to give my other pigs some company  
Rent a doublewide and just live it out in luxary  
In due time, but there's business left to attend to  
I need another farm to bequeath my next of kin to  
And another? Before my great aunt Missy  
Yea, I've been drinkin' but I ain't that pissy  
Thinkin' back to when my daddy told me what it's all about  
He said no matter what I do in life, some of y'all'll pout  
I can deal with that long as all my folks is eatin' good  
Let that channel pass over more than any Easter could  
I'm on the roll again and I ain't talkin' ecstacy  
Tell them folks at Interscope they fixin' to write some checks to me  
Soon as me and Timmy finish up this latest pig schlop  
Man I think you right, it ain't nothing but some hen???  
  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
  
I'm back off in the saddle with smile and that cajolery  
Mama always knew how big a stallion I would grow to be  
Way beyond these suckers both lyrically and vocally  
I doubted for a moment, now it's clear to me I'm supposed to be  
An uncanny whit plus a time that is impeccable  
Make the sharpest cat feel his mind is just a vegetable  
How does Bubba do it, you won't find it in a manual  
Confused them all at first so this time is understandable  
Staring at the ceiling fan, pondering my future now  
Wondering what the hell to do with all this loot I found  
Got my tractor polished up and I'm as drunk as Cooter Brown  
Navigating yet another one of Timmy's supersounds  
  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny  
I could go number one ten times  
Pretty girls that like my rhymes  
You can say Bubba ain't gonna shine  
Guess wha, boy, don't really give a hootnanny...

I just want to enjoy my life  
And show this world how to care  
And nothing brings more joy to my life  
Than knowing a girl will be there  
  
Are ya happy girl?  
(Huh?)  
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two  
(Huh?)  
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you  
Saying you're young and confused  
Well that's a lame excuse  
That's why the only one to blame is you for  
  
Last night  
Can't believe what I was hearing  
Telling me to have a nice life  
So tonight  
I don't think I'll spare your feelings  
You're on your own  
I'm-a do for me what's right  
  
In your eyes a see a second chance  
Maybe I should take another glance  
But for now I'll wash my hands  
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby  
Pharrell say don't do it the same  
But I say ain't playing my games  
But for you my soul still remains  
Cause I love ya baby, love ya baby  
  
Are ya happy girl?  
(Huh?)  
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two  
(Huh?)  
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you  
Saying you're young and confused  
Well that's a lame excuse  
That's why the only one to blame is you for  
  
Last night  
Can't believe what I was hearing  
Telling me to have a nice life  
So tonight  
I don't think I'll spare your feelings  
You're on your own  
I'm-a do for me what's right  
  
I hope you're thinking  
(Tell me girl, when I was your man)  
I hope it senses  
(If you don't understand, then you don't understand)  
We're gonna stop dreaming  
(The way I feel)  
About you  
  
Last night

Ain't gonna play these games with you  
But I still love you  
  
Tell me girl when I was your man  
Ain't nothing gonna take that away  
No no no no, no no-no  
  
See I remember  
In December  
We were walking holding hands  
And I was your man  
Can't we just get back to that?  
Baby?

Just something about you  
The way I'm lookin' at you whatever  
You keep lookin' at me  
You gettin' scared now, right?  
Don't fear me baby, it's just Justin  
It feel good right?  
Listen  
  
I kind of noticed, from one night  
From the club, your front face  
It's kind of weird to me  
Since you're so fine  
If it's up to me your face will change  
  
If you smiling, that should set the tone  
Just be limber  
If you let go, the music should groove your bones  
Just remember  
Sing this song with me  
  
Ain't nobody love you like I love you  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya  
Late at night, I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I touch you  
  
People are so phony  
Nosy 'cause they're lonely  
Aren't you sick of the same thing?  
They say so and so was dating  
Love you or they're hatin'  
When it doesn't matter anyway  
'Cause we're here tonight  
  
If you smiling, that should set the tone  
Just be limber baby  
If you let go, the music should groove your bones  
Baby just remember  
Sing this song with me  
  
Ain't nobody love you like I love you  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya  
Late at night, I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I touch you  
  
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy  
I could change your life  
If you give me that chance  
To be your man  
I won't let you down baby  
If you give me that chance  
To be your man  
Here baby, put on my jacket  
And then  
  
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)  
Girl  
  
Ma, what you wanna do?  
I'm in front of you  
Grab a friend, see I can have fun with two  
Or me and you put on a stage show  
And the mall kids, that's how to change low  
From them you heard "wow, it's the same glow"  
Look at me, I say "yeah, it's the same dough"  
We the same type, you my air of life  
You have sleepin' in the same bed, every night  
  
Go rock with me, you deserve the best  
Take a few shots  
Let it burn in your chest  
We could ride down  
Pumpin' N.E.R.D. in the deck  
Funny how a few words turn into sex  
Play this free, joint called "brain"  
Ma, take a hint  
Make me swerve in the lane  
The name Malicious  
And I burn every track  
Clipse and J. Timberlake  
Now how heavy is that?  
  
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Maybe we'll fly tonight (I just wanna love you baby)  
Girl  
  
Ain't nobody love you like I love you  
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya  
Late at night, I talk to you  
You will know the difference when I touch you  
  
Break this down  
  
You know, I used to dream about this when I was a  
little boy  
I never thought it would end up this way, [drums]  
It's kind of special right? yeah  
You know, you think about it  
Sometimes people just destined  
Destined to do what they do  
And that's what it is  
Now everybody dance.

Hey!  
She's freaky, and she knows it  
She's freaky, and I like it  
  
Listen  
  
She grabs the yellow bottle  
She likes the way it hits her lips  
She gets to the bottom  
It sends her on a trip so right  
She might be going home with me tonight  
  
She looks like a model  
Except she's got a little more ass  
Don't even bother  
Unless you've got that thing she likes  
I hope she's going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
She's freaky, and she knows it  
She's freaky, but I like it  
  
She shuts the room down  
The way she walks and causes a fuss  
The baddest in town  
She's flawless like some uncut ice  
I hope she's going home with me tonight  
  
And all she wants is to dance  
That's why you'll find her on the floor  
But you don't have a chance  
Unless you move the way that she likes  
That's why she's going home with me tonight  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned from everywhere  
She's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Now dance  
Little girl  
You're freaky, but I like it  
Hot damn!  
Let me put my funk on this one time  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned from everywhere  
She's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I have to stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
Man, I swear she's bad, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
She's got me love stoned  
I think I'm love stoned  
She's got me love stoned  
  
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh  
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh  
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh  
  
Those flashing lights come from everywhere  
The way they hit her I just stop and stare  
I'm love stoned from everywhere, and she knows  
I think that she knows  
Think that she knows, oh, oh  
  
And now I walk around without a care  
She's got me hooked, it just ain't fair, but I  
I'm love stoned, and I could swear  
That she knows  
Think that she knows, oh, oh  
She knows, she knows, oh, oh

Walking around middle of the night  
My enemies like with that innocent face  
Cause everything below your neck killin' everything next to it  
It's murder, murder  
You say I need to watch out something might go down  
Good I really wanna take this under the ground, under the ground  
And I'll be down and throw it at that level  
And even when you speak regular it's freaky girl, I say OK  
So come on and leave me cause the deeper you take me the better  
You killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to  
The bed's way under the ground, under the ground  
And I'll be down and throw it at that level  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder  
  
You dancing around, hanging out the window  
Talking real big with your little slim waist  
And with all that below your waist  
Girl, you know the next scene is murder, murder  
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down  
Girl, your body is gonna end up  
Under the ground, under the ground  
I'll be down and throw it at that level  
And even when you dress regular a freak chic  
Girl, you complement my taste  
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better, better  
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to  
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground  
And I'll be down to go to that level  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Ooh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder  
  
Yoko Ono, she got that Yoko Ono  
You know that shit that made John Lennon go solo  
Know that shit gotta be lethal  
If that pussy broke up The Beatles  
Told yah, ruined pop culture  
All them playa days is over  
Got me buying Rovers, rings  
Jumping over brooms and church rooms, kabooms  
That bomb, that P  
It's a problem call the police  
Red bottoms, white sheets that's murder, she a beast  
Faces of death, she fine or what  
Suicide I'm trying to cut, white chalk line 'em up  
Give new meaning to dying to fuck, she's  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder  
  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Oh that girl is murder  
Everybody get down  
Under the lights and sound  
Everybody get down, down  
You know that she's a killer  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Watch it get down, watch it get down  
Murder

My eyes adore ya  
  
Girl you're deep inside each day  
Waiting for the courage  
That never came  
  
So on you went without a clue  
That these adoring eyes they long for you  
I tried to get real close to you  
Hoping that you would see through  
My disguise  
And somehow you know that I  
  
Chorus  
  
I adored ya  
Though I never laid my hands on you  
My eyes adored ya  
My eyes adored ya  
Like you couldn't see  
A millions miles away  
How I adored ya  
So close (so close)  
So close and yet so far  
  
You looked at me  
And saw a friend  
You told me things  
And I'd have to pretend  
That you didn't mean  
The world to me  
And all the while  
Behind the scenes  
I cried with you  
And lived your every dream  
Yes I did  
  
The reality  
The hope's still there  
And dreams run wild  
I'll make time to  
So tell me, tell me baby  
Was I a fool  
Do your eyes adore me, too

If I wrote you a symphony  
Just to say how much you mean to me (What would you do)  
If I told you you were beautiful  
Would you date me on the regular (Tell me would you)  
Well baby I've been around the world  
But I ain't seen myself another girl (Like you)  
This ring here represents my heart  
But there's just one thing I need from you (Saying I do)  
  
[Chorus]  
Because, I can see us holding hands  
Walking on the beach our toes in the sand  
I can see us on the country side  
Sitting in the grass laying side by side  
You can be my baby  
Let me make you my lady, girl you amaze me  
Ain't gotta do nothin crazy  
See all I want you to do is be my love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
Ain't another woman that could take your spot  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
My love (So don't give away)  
Ain't another woman that could take your spot  
My love, my love, my love, my love  
  
Now If I wrote you a love note  
And made you smile with every word I wrote (What would you do)  
Would that make you wanna change your scene  
And wanna be the one on my team (Tell me would you)  
See what's the point in waiting anymore  
Cause girl I've never been more sure (That baby it's you)  
This ring here represents my heart  
And everything that you been waiting for (Just saying I do)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's time to get it JT  
I don't what she hesitatin' for man  
  
Shorty, cool as a fan on the move once again  
But he still has fam from Peru to Japan  
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan  
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can  
Cause the girls really wild, throw they hands up high  
When you wanna come kick it wit a stand up guy  
You don't really wanna let the chance go by  
Cause you ain't seen wit a man so fly  
Friends so fly I can go fly private, cause I handle mine  
B.I., they call me candle guy, simply cause I am on fire  
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny  
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try, you don't come, I ain't gonna die  
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go, why?  
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie  
You say you wanna kick it, when I ain't so high  
Baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy  
Ain't gonna lie, I feel your space  
But forget your face, I swear I will  
Same mark, same bullet anywhere I chill  
Just bring wit me any pair, I will  
  
[Chorus]

Would have given up my life for you  
Guess it's true what they say about love  
It's blind  
Girl, you lied straight to my face  
  
Lookin' in my eyes  
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life  
And all you had to do was apologize  
You didn't say you're sorry  
  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
And now I'm half the man  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
  
You didn't love me enough  
My heart may never mend  
And you'll never get to love me again  
Sadness has me at the end of the line  
  
Helpless, I watched you break this heart of mine  
Loneliness only wants you back here with me  
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me  
And all you had to do was apologize and mean it  
  
But you didn't say you're sorry  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
And now I'm half the man  
  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
You didn't love me enough  
My heart may never mend  
And you'll never get to love me...  
  
Wish like Hell I could go back in time  
Maybe then I could see how  
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try  
But it's too late  
  
Its over now  
You didn't say you're sorry  
I don't understand  
You don't care that you hurt me  
  
And now I'm half the man  
That I used to be when it was you and me  
You didn't love me enough...  
My heart may never mend  
  
And you'll never get to love me again  
Again...  
Again, again, again...  
Never get to love me...

Yea  
Mr. JT, now what you got for me  
Mr. JT, now what you got for me

Mr. JT, now what you got for me  
Mr. JT, now what you got, what you got  
  
You're sneaky  
From the corner of my eye I saw you eyeing me  
I know that you're watching  
Tell me  
What would you do if I encouraged you  
To get next to me  
When nobody's watching  
  
The way your body keeps moving  
Is something that makes me weak

Passing looks at me

My shattered dreams and broken heart  
Are mending on the shelf  
I saw you, holding hands  
Standing close to someone else  
Still I sit, all alone  
Wishing all my feelings gone  
I give my best to you  
Nothing for me to do  
But have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I gotta put you out of my mind  
This time  
Believe that I  
I guess I'm down to my last cry  
[Cry...]  
  
I was here, you were there  
Guess we never could agree  
While the sun shines on you  
I need some love to rain on me  
Still I sit, all alone  
Wishing all my feelings gone  
Gotta get over you [Gotta get over you]  
Nothing for me to do [Yeah..]  
But have one last cry  
  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I gotta put you out of my mind  
This time..  
Believe that I  
I know I've gotta be strong  
Cos my whole life goes on and on  
And on.. And on.... [Oh..]  
  
I'm gonna dry my eyes  
Right after I have my  
One last cry..  
One last cry  
Before I leave it all behind  
I gotta put you out of my mind  
For the very last time  
Believe that I  
I guess I'm down, I guess I'm down  
I guess I'm down to my last cry..

Girl this little game you play  
Don't stop 'till you run too far  
So what's a man like me to say?  
With a bullet laying in my heart  
Damn girl, we go from so hot to so cold  
What am I gonna do about this damn love  
Is that shit in sync or insane, love  
I guess that's the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not

But only when I walk away  
  
What's that, baby, what you say?  
You the one to light up this torch  
'Cause I'm burning down all the way  
Burn it down 'til there ain't no more  
Damn love, how did the sound get so amped up  
Turn off and silence this damn love  
Is that shit insane or in sync, girl  
I guess that's the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
You should see the look on your face  
Baby when I finish what you start  
but I can't hear a word you say  
With a bullet laying in your heart  
Damn love, how did this shit get out of my hands love  
I laid you to rest you said damn love  
This shit's insane, it's insane love  
Ain't that the way we play it  
  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
She loves me now  
She loves me not  
She loves me now  
But only when I walk away  
  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
Only when I walk away

But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away  
But only when I walk away

Come in right here?  
  
Yeah, come on  
  
On that sunny day  
Didn't know I'd meet  
Such a beautiful girl  
Walking down the street  
Seen those bright brown eyes  
With tears coming down  
She deserves a crown  
But where is it now  
Mamma listen  
  
Senorita, I feel for you  
You deal with things, that you don't have to  
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm  
But you could feel this real love  
If you just lay in my  
  
Running fast in my mind  
Girl don't you slow it down  
If we carry on this way  
This thing might leave the ground  
How would you like to fly?  
That's how my queen should arrive  
But you still deserve the crown  
Or hasn't it been found?  
Mamma listen  
  
Senorita, I feel for you  
(Feel for you)  
You deal with things, that you don't have to  
(No, no)

[Snoop Dogg]  
Don't think about it, boy leave her alone  
(Oh ohhh!! Yeah!) nigga you ain't no G!  
She likes my tone, my colone and the way I roll, you ain't no G!  
  
[Verse - Snoop Dogg] (Justin Timberlake)  
Mami, mamasita, have you ever - flown on G5s  
From London - to a beat hah? You gotta have cake  
You'll have Sunday's with chiquitas  
You'll see Venus and Serena, in the Wimbledon Arena  
And I can take you (Uncle Charlie, preach!!)  
  
[Bridge - Uncle Charlie Wilson] (Justin Timberlake)  
Nigga don't be young and foolish  
You don't know what you're doing  
You don't know what you've lost until she's gone (gone)  
And her pretty face, drove you wild  
But you ain't have that Snoop Doggy Dogg Style  
  
[Chorus - Justin Timberlake] (Uncle Charlie Wilson)  
I'm not sure what I see  
Cupid don't fuck wit me!

Hey, yeah, yeah  
Hey, I wrote this song for you  
Listen  
  
Everybody's looking for the fliest thing to say (fliest thing to say)  
But I just want to fly (fly away with you, you, you, you)  
I don't want to be the one to alienate, yeah (alienate)  
You see, I'm trying to find an alien in you (you, you, if it's cool, cool)  
  
We can't take an airplane  
Where we're going is way to high  
Going where the day sky turns into night  
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright  
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride  
  
Hop into my spaceship coupe  
There's only room for two (Me and you)  
And with the top down  
We'll cruise around  
Land and make love on the moon  
Would you like that?  
  
Hop into my spaceship coupe  
There's only room for two (Me and you)  
And with the top of you wrapped up  
In my space lover cocoon  
  
And I love it when I hear you say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Sing to me  
  
I love it when I hear you say  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

Sing to me  
  
Now everybody knows that you're from outer space (outer space)  
But honey, I just want to turn out this space with you (you, you, you, you)  
So drive me to your galaxy where I could play, yeah (that milky way)  
And sugar I'll take my time  
And show you the backseat view, view, if it's cool, cool  
  
We can't take an airplane  
Where we're going is way to high  
Going where the day sky turns into night  
I got the windows special tinted for the stars that get too bright  
And I saved you a seat, so let's ride  
  
Hop into my spaceship coupe  
There's only room for two (Me and you)  
And with the top down  
We'll cruise around  
Land and make love on the moon

Go on and sing to me  
  
Now break it down  
  
Hey  
This is the part  
Where you and me and all of the stars collide tonight  
This is the part  
We take off  
And then we fly far away, far away, far away  
  
Hop into my spaceship coupe  
There's only room for two (Me and you)  
And with the top down  
We'll cruise around  
Land and make love on the moon

Baby, can't you see all the stars?  
They shine, they shine  
Just for you  
I said oh, yeah, yeah  
Just hop into my spaceship coupe  
I saved a seat for you  
Right here next to me  
I'm going to take you to the moon  
And I'll make you say  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh

This is the part  
Where we take off  
And then we fly far away, far away, far away

The beautiful days are long gone  
And I can't seem to breathe  
Feels like it hasn't been that long  
Since you walked away from me  
  
Now I can try to act real strong  
But you and I both know  
I still think of you that way  
You should know that  
  
The beautiful lights, the star-filled nights  
They don't mean a thing  
'Cause you are my star, so it don't seem right  
Without you here with me  
  
Now I can try to act real strong  
But you and I both know  
It's hard for me to say  
You were my soul  
  
Now I could say that I don't love you no more  
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways  
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same  
  
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain  
Now when you're in love it takes time to heal  
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel  
I thought that you would never do me that way  
  
But even after all I still think of you that way  
Now I could say that I don't love you no more  
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways  
  
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same  
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain  
Now love is a game that we both like to play  
When I win or lose, if I go or if I stay  
  
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside  
Girl, you know me inside out  
And I can't get you off of my mind  
And I could say that I don't love you no more  
  
And I could say that I've closed the door for our love  
And I could tell you I feel it's time for us to go our separate ways  
But, baby, I just wouldn't be the same  
'Cause, girl, your love is still on my brain  
La, la, la, la

Ridin' in the drop-top with the top down  
Saw you switchin' lanes, girl  
Pull up to the red light, lookin' right  
Come on, let me get your name, girl  
  
Tell me where your from, what you do, what you like  
Let me get your brain, girl  
And tell me how they that got that pretty little face  
On that pretty little frame girl  
  
But let me show you 'round  
Let me take you out  
Betcha we can have some fun, girl  
'Cause we can it do fast, fast, slow  
  
Which ever way you wanna run, girl  
But let me buy you drinks, better yet rings  
Do it how you want it done, girl  
And who would of thought that you could be the one 'cause I  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't wait to fall in love with you  
You can't wait to fall in love with me  
This just can't be summer love, you'll see  
This just can't be summer love-o-v-e  
  
Come on, and let me show you 'round  
Let me take you out  
Betcha we can have some fun, girl  
'Cause you could dress it up, we could dress it down  
  
Any way you want it done, girl  
Or we can stay home talkin' on the phone  
Rappin' till we see the sun, girl  
Do what I gotta do just gotta show you  
  
That I'm the one, girl  
Well, I'm a freak ya right each and every night  
I know how to do it insane, girl  
'Cause I can make ya hot, make ya stop  
  
Make ya wanna say my name, girl  
Come on, baby, please 'cause I'm on my knees  
Can't get you off my brain, girl  
But who would of thought that you could be the one 'cause I  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Summer's over for the both of us  
(Summer's over)  
But that doesn't mean we should give up on us  
(Don't give up)  
You're the one that I've been thinkin' of  
(You're the one)  
And I knew the day I met you you'd be the one  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Yeah, uh, feels good, don't it?  
Listen, uh  
  
Yeah, this was your city  
You did it all and more, broke every law except for one, babe  
Attraction, are you ready  
I know you feel it  
Pull you nearer 'til you feel it again, oh  
  
I wanna do something right  
But we can do something better  
Ain't no time like tonight  
And we ain't trying to save it 'til later  
Stay out here living the life  
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow  
You got that lil' something I like  
A little something I've been wanting to borrow  
Tonight's the night, come on surrender  
I won't lead your love astray, astray, yeah  
Your love's a weapon  
Give your body some direction  
That's my aim  
Then, we could  
  
Take back the night  
Come on, use me up until there's nothing left  
Take back the night  
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can't catch your breath  
Take back the night  
Ooh, don't know when the sun is rising next  
Take back the night  
So if the feeling's right, then raise your glass and let's  
  
Take back the night, take back the night  
They gon' try to shut us down, but I'll be damned if we gon' let them  
Take back the night, take back the night  
You know you gon' mess around and find out there ain't no one better  
Take back the night, oh  
Yeah  
  
Rare, there's not too many  
No one but you and crowded rooms, we can do anything (yeah)  
Attraction can drive you crazy  
The way you move, you go crazy, that's incentive for me  
  
I wanna do something right  
But we can do something better  
Ain't no time like tonight  
And we ain't trying to save it 'til later  
Stay out here living the life  
Nobody cares who we are tomorrow  
You got that lil' something I like  
A little something I've been wanting to borrow  
Tonight the night's, come on surrender  
I won't lead your love astray, astray, yeah  
Your love's a weapon  
Give your body some direction  
That's my aim  
Then, we could  
  
Take back the night  
Come on, use me up until there's nothing left  
Take back the night  
Dizzy, spinning, sweating, you can't catch your breath  
Take back the night  
Ooh, don't know when the sun is rising next

So if the feeling's right, raise your glass and let's

Sometimes (mmm)  
Sometimes the world gets hard  
Oh na na na  
I'm gonna take it from here girl  
Don't you worry  
  
I want to be your lake, or your bay  
And any problems that you have  
I want to wash 'em away  
I want to be your sky  
So blue and high  
And every time you think of me  
I want to blow your mind  
  
I want to be your air  
So sweet and fair  
So when you feel that you can't breathe  
Ma, I'll be there  
  
I want to be your answer, all the time  
When you see how I put your life before mine  
With no question  
  
When all the love feels gone  
And you can't carry on  
Don't worry, girl

Every morning, every time  
Don't worry, girl

I want to hold your hands  
Review all your plans  
I want to make sure everyone of your dreams is there  
I would be your Broadway show on review  
So I can act out how God was when he made you  
I want to be your lighthouse when you get lost  
I'll light a bright and shiny path to help you across  
I want to be your mother, wait  
See what I see  
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me  
'Cause I love you  
  
When all the love feels gone  
And you can't carry on

And you realize the world is cold

Just as sure as the sun will shine  
Every morning, every time

Give me one reason why we should not be leaving  
This world is so deceiving, the time is now  
Let's fly away speeding  
Through the Garden of Eden  
Where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds  
  
When all the love feels gone  
And you can't carry on  
Don't worry, girl

(No, no)  
See there's the good guys  
And also heartbreak crooks  
Your hearts the real one  
Just take a look inside  
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide  
  
So there you go  
Don't worry  
To help you weather the storm

No matter what place  
You can always count on me

Cause I'm in love with that girl  
So don't be mad at me  
Cause I'm in love with that girl  
So don't be mad at me  
So what you're from the other side of the tracks  
So what if the world don't think we match  
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what  
I'm in love with that girl  
And she told me, she's in love with me  
  
Now we didn't have to fall, but fell in love to the bottom babe  
No one's there to catch us when we fell from heaven that day  
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it babe  
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same  
  
I'm in love with that girl  
So don't be mad at me  
Cause I'm in love with that girl

Pretty lady  
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

But I don't pay attention to the talk baby  
And I don't really care if they stop and stare  
Because they see my number one  
My number one girl  
  
I told you I'm in love with that girl  
So don't be mad at me  
I'm in love with that girl  
So don't be mad at me

So what if the world don't think we match

I'm in love with that girl  
She already told me, that she's in love with me  
  
I'm in love, I'm in love with that girl  
I don't care what people say, people say  
Cause I'm in love with that girl

When the visions around you,  
Bring tears to your eyes.  
And all that surrounds you,  
Are secrets and lies.  
I'll be your strength  
I'll give you hope,  
Keeping your faith when it's gone.  
The one you should call,  
Was standing here all alone.  
Chorus  
And I will take you in my arms,  
And hold you right were you belong.  
'Til the day my life is through...  
This I promise you...  
This I promise you...  
I've loved you forever,  
In lifetimes before.  
And I promise you never...  
Will you hurt anymore.  
I give you my word,  
I give you my heart.  
This is a battle we've won.  
And with this vow,  
Forever has now begun...  
Just close your eyes,  
Each lovin' day.  
And know this feeling won't go away.  
'Til the day my life is through...  
This I promise you...  
Over and over I fall...  
When I hear you call...  
Without you in my life, baby.  
I just wouldn't be living at all...  
Chorus  
And I will take you in my arms,  
And hold you right were you belong.  
'Til the day my life is through...  
This I promise you, baby.  
Just close your eyes,  
Each lovin' day.  
And know this feeling won't go away.  
Every word I say is true...  
This I promise you...  
I promise you...

Red was the color of her eyes  
And she put me in a meditation state  
Her skin was white so white  
Looked like it had no expiration date  
Black is the color of the night  
And it's time for feeding and her body waits  
There's just something 'bout the demon that she brings out of me  
When we raise hell I can't stay away  
  
Aw, give it to me now  
So evil in your dress  
It circulates you start to feel it  
Devil in the flesh  
Once you start to invoke her spirit  
Got you on the floor  
She comes alive when your appearing  
Hungry for some more  
  
I think she's got that true blood  
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you  
She's got that true blood  
I come around and raise the hell out of you  
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming  
Make me wanna build a coffin for two  
She's got that true blood  
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you  
It makes me say  
  
Now I feel my fever on the rise  
In my bones and my body starts to quake  
Straight up from my toes to my mind  
She controls me but I don't want to escape  
All the other ones that have tried  
Find out that they have made their final mistake  
But when she got a bite of my type  
She told me that she found her perfect blood mate  
  
So evil in your dress  
It circulates you start to feel it  
Devil in the flesh  
Once you start to invoke her spirit  
Got you on the floor  
She comes alive when your appearing  
Hungry for some more  
  
I think she's got that true blood  
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you  
She's got that true blood  
I come around and raise the hell out of you  
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming  
Make me wanna build a coffin for two  
She's got that true blood  
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you  
It makes me say  
  
Your pheromones invaded my instinct  
I start to seem like an animal  
Roast me in your perfection, I'm mad, I don't wanna think  
'Cause the others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle  
It feels like  
The others wanna burn with me but they don't hold a candle  
Ooh sometimes it feels like  
  
I think she's got that true blood  
Every time you're 'round I can smell it in you  
She's got that true blood  
I come around and raise the hell out of you  
It's that demon, it's so mean, that's got me screaming  
Make me wanna build a coffin for two  
She's got that true blood  
But baby, I just do it for the thrill out of you  
It makes me say  
Give it to me, that goes to boogie, that goes to high  
Give it to me  
  
Yeah  
Now that you got me  
Tell me what your gonna do with me  
I taste your blood  
I found out you was a perfect fit  
Mmm, come on mama  
Show me what your working with  
Mmm, come on mama  
Go on show me what your working with

[Until the end of time]  
  
Listen  
  
Woke up this morning  
Heard the TV sayin' something  
'Bout disaster in the world, and  
It made me wonder where I'm going  
There's so much darkness in the world  
But I see beauty left in you, girl  
And what you give me lets me know  
That I'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
Because if your love was all I had  
In this life  
Well, that would be enough  
Until the end of time  
So rest your weary heart  
And relax your mind  
Cause I'm gonna love you girl  
Until the end of time  
  
You've got me singing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Everybody sing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
Everybody singing  
Oh whoa, whoa, whoa, yeah  
  
Now if you're ever wondering  
About the way I'm feeling  
Well, baby girl, there ain't no question  
Just to be around you is a blessing  
Sick and tired of trying to save the world  
I just want to spend my time with you, girl  
And what you're give me lets me know  
That we'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You've got me singing

[Black Eyed Peas]  
What's wrong with the world, Mama?  
People livin' like they ain't got no mamas.  
I think the whole world is addicted to the drama,  
Only attracted to things that bring the trauma.  
Overseas, yea, we trying to stop terrorism,  
But we still got terrorists here livin'  
In the usa, the big cia, the blood through the cripts of the kkk.  
But if you only have love for your own race,  
Then you only leave space to discriminate,  
And to disciminate only generates hate,  
And when you hate you're bound to get irate.  
Madness is what you demonstrate,  
And that's exacly how Enga works and operates.  
Man, ya gotta have love to set it straight.  
Take control of your mind and meditate.  
Let your soul gravitate to the love, ya'll.  
  
[Chorus - Justin Timberlake]  
People killin', people dyin'.  
Children hurtin', you here them cryin'.  
Can you practice what you preach,  
And would you turn the other cheek?  
Father, Father, Father, help us.  
Send some guidence from above.  
These people got me, got me, questionin'  
Where is the love?  
(where is the love,  
Where is the love,  
Where is the love,  
The love, the love)  
  
[Black Eyed Peas]  
It just ain't the same.  
Always have changed,  
New days are strange.  
Is the world the same?  
If love and peace is so strong,  
Why would pieces of love that don't belong?  
Nation's dropping bombs,  
Chemical gases filling lungs of little ones,  
With ongoing suffering as the youth die young.  
So, ask yourself, is the lovin' really caused,  
So I can ask myself really what is going wrong  
In this world that we livin' in.  
People keep on givin' in,  
Makin' wrong decisions,  
Only visions of a different end.  
Now we respectin' each other  
And I've my brother.  
A war's going on,  
But the reason's undercover.  
The truth is kept secret  
And swept under the rug  
If you never know the truth,  
Then you never know love.  
Where's the love ya'll (I don't really know)  
Where's the truth ya'll (I don't really know)  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I feel the weight of the world on my shoulder.  
As I'm gettin older ya'll people gets colder.  
Most of us only care about money-makin.  
Selfishness got us followin' the wrong direction.  
Wrong information always shown by the media,  
Negative images is the main criteria.  
Infecting the young minds faster than bacteria.  
Kids wanna act like what they see in the cinemas.  
  
What ever happened to the values of humanity?  
What ever happened to the fairness and equality?  
Instead of spreading love, we're spreadin' anamosity.  
Lack of understanding leading us away from unity.  
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling under.  
That's the reason why sometimes I'm feeling down.  
There's no wonder why sometimes I'm feeling under.  
Gotta keep my faith alive till love is found.  
  
[Chorus:]

Do  
Do do do doooooo  
Dooo doooo  
Oooo  
Mmmmm  
  
You're still captivating  
Even though it's been so long  
You used to love me  
Tell me baby what went wrong  
'cause now you march to a beat of a different song  
I try to understand that we needed space  
But everywhere I turn I see your face  
And I've been wating for you to come home  
'cause I don't want to be alone  
Still Love you  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How am I suppose to carry on now  
With you  
You were my life  
  
I have changed girl since I last saw you  
When you left you don't know what you put me through  
But my heart still racing just being next to you  
I can't escape the magic in your eyes  
Is there a way to make you realize  
There is no one more special to my heart  
But you want us to be apart  
Still Love  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How am I suppose to carry on now  
With you  
  
You were my world  
You ment everything to me  
Your the air I breathe,  
The song I sing  
You were my queen  
I was your King  
But if we can try to work it out  
We'll show the world what love is about  
  
Baby come home  
'cause I can't no more  
Of this loneliness and emptiness  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How am I suppose to carry on now  
Without you  
  
Why did you take away your love  
When did you think to just give up  
How ami suppose to carry on  
Without you  
You were my life
