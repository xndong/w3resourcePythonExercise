Ang Pag-Ibig kong Ito  
Moonstar88  
Umiiyak ang aking pusong nagdurusa  
Ngunit ayokong may makakita  
Kahit anong sakit ang aking naranasan  
'Yan ay ayokong kanyang malaman  
  
Refrain:  
Mga araw na nagdaan,  
kailanma'y hindi malilimutan  
Kay tamis na raw ng pagmamahalan  
Ang akala ko'y walang hangganan  
  
Chorus:  
Ang pag-ibig kong ito  
Luha ang tanging nakamit buhat sa'yo  
Kaya't sa Maykapal  
Tuwina'y dalangin ko  
Sana'y...  
  
(Repeat All)  
  
Kapalaran ko ay magbago  
  
(repeat Refrain)  
  
(repeat Chorus)  
  
Kapalaran ko ay magbago

Awit Kay Inay  
  
May hihigit pa ba sa isang katulad mo  
Inang mapagmahal na totoo  
Lahat nang buti ay naroon sa puso  
Buhay man ay handang ialay mo  
Walang inang matitiis ang isang anak  
Ika'y dakila at higit ka sa lahat  
  
Ang awit na ito ay alay ko sa iyo  
Ang himig at titik ay pag-ibig sa puso ko  
Ika'y nagiisa Ikaw lang sa mundo  
Ang may pusong wagas ganyan ang tulad mo  
  
Lahat ibibigay lahat gagawin mo  
Ganyan lagi ikaw sa anak mo  
Lahat nang buti nya ang laging hangad mo  
Patawad ay lagi sa puso mo....  
  
Walang inang matitiis ang isang anak  
Ika'y dakila at higit ka sa lahat  
  
Ang awit na ito  
Ay alay ko sa iyo  
Ang himig at titik ay pag-ibig sa puso ko  
Ikay nag-iisa ikaw lang sa mundo  
Ang may pusong wagas ganyan ang tulad mo

You're always there for me  
You pick me up when I'm down  
Ever so willing to guide me  
Giving me unconditional love  
Sometimes I refuse to listed  
But I know you're so right  
You only want good things in my life  
I may not say that much  
But how I love you  
And I can only thank God  
For giving me to you  
I can't imagine my world  
Without you, without you  
  
Chorus:  
You've given me life love  
And my heart and my soul  
You taught me kindness  
And compassion  
You let my goodness flow  
You're the constant guiding light  
That shines one me  
And without you  
I can never be me  
  
Ever since I was a child  
I see you so strong  
You're the one that I run to  
When things go wrong  
You're never tires of loving me  
You're always there to take good care of me  
  
Everything good about me  
Is all because of you...  
(Repeat Chorus)

With Juddha Paolo  
  
You can reach me by railway  
You can reach me by trailway  
You can reach me on an airplane  
You can reach me with your mind  
You can reach me by caravan  
Cross the desert like an Aram man  
I don't care how you get here  
Just - get here if you can -  
You can reach me by sail boat  
Climb a tree and swing rope to rope  
Take a sled and slide down the-slope  
Into these arms of mine  
You can jump on a speedy colt  
Cross the border in a blaze of hope  
I don't care how you get here  
Just get here if you can  
There are hills and mountains between us  
Always something to get over  
If I had my way, surely you would be closer  
I need you closer  
  
You can windsurf into my life  
Take me up on a carpet ride  
You can make it in a big balloon  
But you better make it soon'  
You can reach me by caravan  
Cross the desert like - an Arab man  
I don't care how you get here, just - get here  
If you can  
I don't care how you get here, just --get  
Here if - you can

He's always on my mind  
From the time I wake up  
Till I close my eyes  
He's everywhere I go  
He's all I know  
Though he's so far away  
It just keeps getting stronger everyday  
And even now he's gone  
I'm still holding on  
So tell me, where do I start  
Coz it's breaking' my heart  
Don't want to let her go  
[CHORUS:]  
Maybe my love will come back someday  
Only heaven knows  
And maybe our hearts will find a way  
But only heaven knows  
And all I can do is hope and pray  
Coz heaven knows  
My friends keep telling me  
That if you really love him  
You've got to set him free  
And if he returns in time  
I'll know he's mine  
But tell me where do I start  
Coz it's breaking my heart  
Don't want to let her go  
Repeat chorus except last line  
[BRIDGE:]  
Coz heaven knows  
Why I live in despair  
Coz wide awake or dreaming  
I know he's never there  
And all the time I act so brave  
I'm shaking inside  
Why does it hurt me so?  
[REPEAT CHORUS]  
Heaven knows? Heaven knows.

Isang araw sa aking paglalakad  
Nakasalubong ka at nakausap  
At iyong 'tinanong  
Noon ding araw na iyon  
Pangalan ko at tirahan namin  
Kung sa'n naroon  
Hindi ako nakakibo sa iyo  
At 'di ko rin alam ang isasagot ko  
Dibdib ko ay kumakaba  
Ngunit may halong saya  
Ano pa kaya itong aking nadarama  
Chorus:  
Kailan kita muling makikita  
Sa bahay namin ba ikaw ay pupunta  
Ngunit hindi ko na nabanggit kung saan ba  
Kailan nga ba magbabalik ka  
Kailan nga ba  
Ooh...oh  
Hindi ako nakakibo sa iyo  
At 'di ko rin alam ang isasagot ko  
Dibdib ko ay kumakaba  
Ngunit may halong saya  
Ano pa kaya itong aking nadarama  
Chorus:  
Kailan kita muling makikita  
Sa bahay namin ba ikaw ay pupunta  
Ngunit hindi ko na nabanggit kung saan ba  
Kailan nga ba magbabalik ka  
Woh-oh...  
Chorus:  
Kailan kita muling makikita  
Sa bahay namin ba ikaw ay pupunta  
Ngunit hindi ko na nabanggit kung saan ba  
Kailan nga ba magbabalik ka  
Kailan nga ba  
Kailan nga ba

May sikreto akong sasabihin sa 'yo  
Mayroong nangyaring hindi mo alam  
Ito'y isang lihim itinagong kay tagal  
Muntik na kitang minahal  
'Di ko noon nakayang ipadama sa 'yo  
Ang nararamdaman ng pusong ito  
At hanggang ngayon ay naaalala pa  
Muntik na kitang minahal  
  
REFRAIN:  
Ngayon ay aaminin ko na  
Na sana nga ay tayong dalawa  
Bawat tanong mo'y iniwasan ko  
Akala ang pag-ibig mo'y 'di totoo  
'Di ko alam kung ano ang nangyari  
Damdamin ko sa 'yo'y hindi ko masabi  
Hanggang ang puso mo'y mapagod  
Sa paghihintay kay tagal  
Saka ko lang naisip muntik na kitang minahal  
  
'Di ko noon nakayang ipadama sa 'yo  
Ang nararamdaman ng pusong ito  
At hanggang ngayon ay naaalala pa  
Muntik na kitang minahal  
  
REFRAIN:  
Ngayon ay aaminin ko na  
Na sana nga'y tayong dalawa  
Bawat tanong mo'y iniwasan ko  
Akala ang pag-ibig mo'y 'di totoo  
'Di ko alam kung ano ang nangyari  
Damdamin ko sa 'yo'y hindi ko nasabi  
Hanggang ang puso mo'y mapagod  
Sa paghihintay kay tagal  
Saka ko lang naisip  
Muntik na kitang minahal  
  
Hanggang ang puso mo'y mapagod  
Sa paghihintay kay tagal  
Saka ko lang naisip  
Muntik na kitang minahal

Ooh hooh, ahh, ahhhh...  
  
It is time to change our ways  
Speak a one united phrase  
In every song that we sing  
In every dream that we dream  
Telling it is up to us to decide  
  
All the conflicts in our hearts  
Let's forget the way it starts  
Let's be together like then  
Together hand and hand  
For this world can be stronger again  
  
For we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
All the conflicts in our hearts  
Let's forget the way it starts  
Let's be together like then  
Together hand and hand  
For this world can be stronger again  
  
For we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
Oooh one love is all that we need  
Oooh one earth is all that we have  
We were given hearts to love  
By the heavens up above  
  
Yeah... Yeah  
  
Ooh we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
Ooh we were born in love  
That's how we came about  
The time has come for us  
To make our voice as one in sharing  
Replace the hate we have with caring  
So happy we can be  
If we would all agree  
And there would be delight  
For all the things we see  
Let's cherish  
The only world we have  
  
Ooh let's cherish  
The only world we have

Nang minsang ikaw ay nakita  
Puso ko'y nalito at iiwas na sana  
Ngunit bakit sadyang nagpumilit ka  
At sa akin pa nga ay humabol pa  
At 'di na nga naiwasan kita  
  
Bakit kaya 'di ko maunawaan  
Ang aking gagawin ay hindi ko malaman  
'Pag ikaw ay aking nakikita  
Sa iyo ay parang naiinis pa  
Kung wala naman ay hinahanap ka  
  
Chorus  
Tunay kayang may pagtingin  
Ang aking puso't damdamin  
Isip ay nalilito  
Ano nga kaya ito  
Laging naiisip ka  
Kapag 'di na nakikita  
Tunay nga kayang ganyan  
'Pag puso'y nakialam  
  
Ahh...  
  
Repeat 2nd stanza  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Woh  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
Siya na'ng nakialam  
Hoh hoh  
Do do do pa ra  
Do do do pa ra yeah

I want you to stay  
Never go away from me  
Stay forever  
But now, now that you're gone  
All I can do is pray for you  
To be here beside me again  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality  
  
And now I must move on  
Tryin to forget all the memories of you near me  
But I can't let go of your love that has stopped me  
To hold on  
  
I want you to stay  
Never go away from me  
Stay forever  
But now, now that you're gone  
All I can do is pray for you  
To be here beside me again  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality, ooh  
  
And now I must move on  
Tryin to forget all the memories of you near me  
But I can't let go of your love that has stopped me  
To hold on  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality  
  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that love will conquer all  
Why did you have to leave me  
When you said that dreaming was as good as reality  
  
I want you to stay  
Never go away from me  
Stay forever  
I want to stay  
But I have to my way, hmm...

I just, can't tell  
This feeling here inside me  
I feel, so strange  
Whenever you are near me  
Everytime I see you pass I smile  
But then you never seem to realize  
Its for your eyes  
If you would say hello  
It would be nice  
Chorus:  
You're in my mind  
Almost all the time  
Every single minute all I do is think of you  
And deep inside  
In this heart of mine  
I have to go on wishing till it's time  
One day, you came  
And you are oh so near me  
I smiled, and then  
You turn and did not see me  
How am I supposed to get to meet you  
What should I do  
Your in my dreams, I feel it seems  
That you don't feel it quite the way I do  
Repeat chorus  
Yeahhh heyyyy ohhh  
Yes deep inside  
In this heart of mine  
I have to go on wishing till it's time  
Repeat chorus  
Yeaaaaahhh  
Till it's time.......

I recall when you said that you would never leave me  
You told me more, so much more like when the time you whispered in my ear  
There was heaven in my heart  
I remember when you said that you'd be here forever  
  
Then you left without even saying that you're leaving  
I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday  
And I pray that you would stay  
But then you're gone and, oh, so far away  
  
CHORUS  
I was afraid this time would come  
I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within  
I have learned to live my life beside you  
  
Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight  
And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again  
I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end  
  
And then you left without even saying that you're leaving  
I was hurt and it really won't be easy to forget yesterday  
And I pray that you would stay  
But then you're gone and, oh, so far away  
  
CHORUS  
I was afraid this time would come  
I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within  
I have learned to live my life beside you  
  
Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight  
And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again  
I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end  
  
Woh oh yeah  
  
CHORUS  
I was afraid this time would come  
I wasn't prepared to face this kind of hurtin' from within  
I have learned to live my life beside you  
  
Maybe I'll just dream of you tonight  
And if into my dream you'll come and touch me once again  
I'll just keep on dreaming till my heartaches end  
  
CODA  
Keep on dreaming till my heartaches end...

I saw you yesterday with another girl  
When you looked my way  
I just pretended I didn't see you  
What else can I do  
  
Chorus  
You were all I've wanted  
'Cause you just don't seem to care  
You took me for granted  
And I don't think it is fair  
But my heart keeps telling me  
That you'd be there for me  
And I'll just wait and understand  
  
When you looked my way  
I just pretended I didn't see you  
What else can I do  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
But my heart keeps telling me  
That you'd be there for me  
So I'll just wait and understand  
  
Ooh...

What life is all about  
I  
Isn't it right that we be together  
Just like we've always been  
Isn't it time that we start tomorrow  
With what we have today  
Refrain  
Here we are, we live, we laugh and we cry  
We share the dream someday we may find  
A love that is true that will last for all time  
It seems what life is (just) all about  
Ii  
Isn't it love we need to believe in  
Whenever we're in doubt  
It isn't hard to share what we're feelin  
We just have to try  
Refrain  
Refrain  
Coda  
Life's for you and I
