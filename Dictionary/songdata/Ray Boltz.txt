Always Be A Child  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
I was there  
When you drew the breath of life  
And I could hear your voice  
The first time that you cried  
And though you couldn't see Me  
I was very near  
And there's something now  
That I want you to hear  
Chorus:  
You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
And when you need some love  
My arms are open wide  
And even when you're growing old  
I hope you realize  
You will always be a child  
In my eyes  
I was there the first time  
That you prayed  
And I heard  
All the promises you made  
And when you fell before Me  
Crying, Father, I have sinned  
I picked you up  
And held you close again  
Chorus (repeat)

Another Child To Hold  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
She looks down at her angel  
Sleeping in his bed  
She gently kneels beside him  
And then she bows her head  
And just like other mothers  
Who lived so long ago  
She brings her child to Jesus  
And give him to the Lord  
chorus:  
Jesus, here's another child to hold  
Keep this child safe and warm  
This world can be so cold  
Take this child in Your arms  
And never let him go  
Jesus, here's another child to hold  
He watched his only daughter  
Leaving on a date  
He doesn't want to worry  
But now it's getting late  
Waiting in the darkness  
He kneels down on the floor  
And offers up a silent prayer  
As he listens for the door  
Wherever there are children, Lord  
In danger or in need  
May you find someone there  
Praying on their knees  
Oh, please  
chorus

They were watching from a distance  
And they could not take their eyes from You  
You were bleeding, they were weeping  
Faithful sisters, they had followed You  
  
They did not understand, they could not see  
They were mourning their loss  
As the sky turned black and the Earth turned red  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
He was standing near Your mother  
They were so close, they could hear You sighing  
All around them angry voices  
Pierced the darkness and You were dying  
  
But they would not leave, they lingered there  
No matter the cost  
They were staying and they were praying  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
Keep me near the Cross, near the Cross  
May I never stray so far  
That I cannot see what flowed down for me  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
Now I'm standing in Your presence  
And I cannot take my eyes from You  
You have risen, I'm forgiven  
Precious Saviour, oh I worship You  
  
No, I'm not looking back  
I've heard Your voice and I'm staying here  
I've made my choice, for now it's real  
Now I kneel at the foot of the Cross  
  
Keep me near the Cross, near the Cross  
May I never stray so far  
That I cannot see what flowed down for me  
At the foot of the Cross  
  
Keep me near the Cross, near the Cross  
May I never stray so far  
That I cannot see what flowed down for me  
At the foot of the Cross

Awesome God  
Words and Music by Rich Mullins  
Oh, when He rolls up His sleeves  
He ain't just puttin' on the Ritz,  
Our God is an awesome God.  
There's thunder in His footsteps  
And lightning in His fists.  
Our God is an awesome God.  
And the Lord, He wasn't jokin'  
When He kicked 'em out of Eden,  
It wasn't for no reason  
That He shed His blood,  
His return is very close  
And so you better be believin' that our  
God is an awesome God.  
  
[Chorus]  
Our God is an awesome God,  
He reigns from Heaven above,  
With wisdom, power and love,  
Our God is an awesome God.  
  
And when the sky was starless  
In the void of the night,  
Our God is an awesome God.  
He spoke into the darkness  
And created the light.  
Our God is an awesome God.  
The judgment and wrath  
He poured out on Sodom,  
The mercy and grace  
He gave us at the cross,  
I hope that we have not  
Too quickly forgotten that our  
God is an awesome God.  
  
[Chorus](repeat)  
Our God is an awesome God.  
[Chorus](repeat 2X)

And we lift up our hearts in praise

Bethlehem Star  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Mark Pay, Music by Steve Millikan, Ray Boltz,
and Mark Pay  
When God created the heaven and earth  
He said let there be light  
And a million shining stars appeared  
On the canvas of the night  
They all declared the glory  
Of the Father up above  
But only one startled the way  
To His greatest gift of love  
Chorus:  
Bethlehem starhow beautiful you are  
Shining in the darkness  
Guiding strangers from afar  
As your light fills the heavens  
His love fills my heart  
So shine for me mybethlehem star  
From far away the wise men came  
To find the tiny King  
In Bethlehem they worshipped Him  
And gave their offerings  
Star up in the heavens  
Without your holy light  
They would still be searching  
Somewhere in the night  
Chorus (repeat)  
I may not be a wise man  
And I don't have much to bring  
But my heart is my gift of love  
So lead me to the King  
Bethlehem starhow beautiful you are  
Shining in the darkness  
Guiding strangers from afar  
As your light fills the heavens  
His love fills my heart  
So shine for me mybethlehem star  
Oh that I might worship Him  
Shine for mebethlehem star

Bought With Blood  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Said the poor man to the rich man  
Sitting in the shade,  
They say that you have money  
They say you have it made  
Did you know that I have riches, too?  
Perhaps you cannot see  
Theres no greater treasure  
Than what He paid for me  
Chorus:  
Bought with Blood, not with gold  
He gave His life to make me whole  
Theres no doubt God is love  
For my soul was bought with Blood  
Said the rich man to the poor man,  
I believe what you have said  
And he brought him to his table  
And then they broke the bread  
He said, Friend, you are my brother  
We are equal in Gods sight  
And they fellowshipped together  
And sang throughout the night  
Chorus  
You can keep the silver  
You can keep the gold  
Give me the treasure  
Buried in my soul

Caught in the valley of shadow,  
Fear and doubt  
Desperately searching  
There was no way out  
But then the hand of mercy  
Came reaching for me  
Lifted me out of my broken past  
And brought me  
Into the land of the free  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Here in the brave new world  
My faith is standing strong  
Here in the brave new world  
I'm right where I belong  
Its Your amazing grace  
That brought my heart  
Right to this place  
The fear is gone  
I'm living in a brave new world  
  
I stand on a mountain of possibilities  
I hear You calling me to spread my wings  
I know you'll hold me up, Lord  
When I feel too weak to fly  
Cause its through the power of your love  
That keeps me soaring through the sky  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]  
It was a universe of dark despair  
Now I see You shining everywhere  
I know you're always there  
  
[CHORUS (repeat 2X)]

Standing up on the outside,  
Falling down within,  
Looking righteous as a pharisee,  
Filled with guilt and sin,  
Trying to walk with Jesus  
The strait and narrow road,  
Holding on to this world,  
I just could not let go,  
That's such a heavy road.  
Chorus  
Come and break the yoke Lord,  
Come and set this child free,  
Come tear down the walls of pride  
And all I hide beneath,  
Freedom always came to those  
Who receive the words you spoke,  
I receive your word, break the yoke,  
I receive your word, break the yoke.  
Praying with my brother  
Is such a precious time,  
When I confessed my weaknesses  
He joined his hands with mine,  
I know something happened  
When he prayed with me,  
The weight of sin fell off,  
Jesus set me free.  
Come and break the yoke Lord,  
Come and set your children free,  
Come tear down the walls of pride  
And false humility,  
The nail scars in your hands and feet  
Prove your love for us is not a joke,  
Do what you must, break the yoke,  
Do what you must, break the yoke.  
Now I'm back on my feet again,  
A new life's begun,  
Every day I'm walking with Jesus,  
But you know there are days we even run,  
Set free to serve and worship Him,  
All the chains He broke,  
I'll praise His name forever,  
He broke the yoke,  
I'll praise your name Lord,  
You broke the yoke, you broke the yoke.  
  
Behold  
Behold the cross that Jesus bore,  
Behold the crown of thorns that he wore,  
Behold the price that Jesus paid,  
The glorious sacrifice that he made.  
Chorus  
Behold, oh behold, Jesus Christ the Lord,  
Behold, He is the one that we adore.  
Behold the tomb where Jesus lay,  
Behold the stone, it's been rolled away,  
Behold His resurrection power,  
He lives again, He lives this hour.  
Chorus  
Behold the world in slumber lies,  
And then thunder fills the skies,  
An angel shouts, a trumpet sounds,  
The saints of God are glory bound.

And we adore you Lord,  
And we adore your name,  
And we lift up our hearts in praise,

Carry On  
Words and music by Lawrence Chewning  
Carry on, carry on, carry on  
To the students on the campus  
Who are speaking out for Jesus  
As the winds of opposition  
Swirl around you day by day...  
Even if you're mocked and hated  
Don't you be intimidated  
There's a great reward that's waiting  
If you only carry on  
chorus:  
Carry on, carry on  
It won't be long before  
We're gathered 'round God's throne  
Carry on, carry on  
To the lonely missionary  
To the pastor growing weary  
To the parents of the wayward child  
For whom you've prayed so long...  
This is not the time to let up  
It's the time to lift your head up  
When you sow in tears  
You'll reap in joy  
Don't stop, carry on  
chorus  
And if you're facing great temptation  
And you need some consolation  
'Cause the devil's doing all he can  
Just to make you trip and fall...  
Well, the devil will accuse you  
He'll even try to bruise you  
But resist him, and he'll flee from you  
Get up, and carry on  
chorus (repeat)  
Carry on

Church Hop  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and John Higgins  
Once there was a shepherd  
I've been told  
Had some sheep  
Who wouldn't stay in the fold  
Sunday morning, Wednesday night  
Checking out every church in sight  
Shepherd said,  
Kids we gotta have a talk  
The wolves are gonna get you  
If you're not in a flock  
chorus:  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Once you get started  
You just can't stop  
Don't you be doing that church hop  
Some folks go where they get fed  
They do  
Some folks go where they feel led  
Do you?  
Some folks just can't  
Make up their mind  
Changing churches all the time  
They want something hot  
They want something new  
They just can't find that perfect pew  
chorus  
Some for the money  
Some for the show  
Preach about commitment  
And they go, go, go  
Doing that church hop  
Doing that church hop  
Once you get started  
You just can't stop  
Don't you be doing that church hop

Church On Fire  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Out on the streets of Jerusalem  
Something was going down  
People were shouting and praising God  
A crowd was gathered around  
Peter started preaching  
His words were clear and true  
The power was strong and before too long  
Everybody knew  
chorus:  
This church is on fire  
Burning with the power of God almighty  
Serving Him and praising His name  
Is our only desire  
Go and tell your neighbor  
All that God has done for you  
Jesus said you are the light  
And this Church is on fire  
The fire that started long ago  
Is burning bright today  
It's spreading all around the world  
Wherever people pray  
The Church of God is moving  
As long as there's a soul to tell  
That Jesus is the Son of God  
And Jesus is alive and well  
chorus  
I said this  
I said this church  
This church is  
This church is on fire

Dare To Believe  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
You're standing at a mountain  
That you know you cannot climb  
Your enemys approaching  
You hear him coming from behind  
There is trouble all around you  
There's no place to run away  
But there's a voice  
That's deep inside you  
Saying it's time to stand in faith  
Chorus:  
I dare to believe  
That miracles happen,  
That mountains still move,  
And demons must flee  
For the God that we serve  
He is much more than able  
So don't be afraid  
Stand up and say,  
I dare to believe  
There's a miracle inside you  
It's just a mustard seed of faith  
But by the mighty hand of God now  
You know that tiny seed was placed  
And though this world  
May try to crush you  
It can never keep you down  
Soon the life of God inside you  
Will come breaking through the ground  
Chorus  
No matter what the doubters tell you  
No matter what the devil says  
No matter what anybody,  
Anybody else does  
You just keep trusting Jesus  
You'll see and won't be long  
God is right and the doubters are wrong  
Just say,  
Chorus 2X  
No don't be afraid  
Just stand up and say,  
I dare to believe  
No don't be afraid  
Just stand up and say,  
I dare to believe

Does The Light Still Shine?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
He used to run the mission  
This old friend of mine  
And it stood down on the corner  
Underneath a neon sign  
Had a cross that lit up heaven  
And the message "Jesus Saves"  
And each week at the old folks' home  
His question was the same  
Chorus:  
Does the light still shine?  
Does the light still shine?  
Is it bright enough  
For the lost to find?  
Does the light still shine?  
Now how was I to tell him  
They tore the old sign down,  
Explain about electric codes,  
And zoning in the town  
I knew that it would break his heart,  
I didn't want to lie  
So I just held his hand and smiled  
When he asked me the last time,  
Chorus  
In a quiet ceremony  
I began to understand  
After all the testimonies  
For this ordinary man  
He took them in, he gave them food  
He taught them of God's grace  
And as they spoke  
I saw a light  
Shining on each face  
And you may not believe it  
But I tell you that's it true  
The light kept growing brighter  
Until it filled the room  
I heard a voice say,  
This, my friend, is what  
I was speaking of...  
When you touch someone in Jesus' name  
There shines the light of love  
Oh the light still shines  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes it's bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Oh the light still shines  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes the light still shines  
And it's bright enough  
For the lost to find  
Oh the light still shines  
Yes the light still shines

Fallen Not Forgotten  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
He stood beside his daddy  
And watched the solders marching by  
It was Veteran's Day and he wondered  
Why there were tears in daddy's eyes  
Later they laid flowers  
Beside a monument of stone  
He said, My daddy went to fight  
And didn't make it home  
Chorus:  
Fallen, not forgotten  
He was a hero  
He stood so tall  
And forever, we will remember  
With honor and glory,  
He gave his all  
They left behind their families  
And the towns where they were born  
For the rice paddies of Vietnam  
And the sands of Desert Storm  
They were soldiers in Korea  
And World War One  
And World War Two  
They paid the price  
Some gave their lives  
And they fought for me and you  
Fallen, not forgotten  
They were the heroes  
Who stood so tall  
And forever, we will remember  
With honor and glory,  
They gave their all  
Now freedom is a blessing  
But freedom has a price  
And we must remember those  
Who paid it with their lives  
Remember the  
Fallen, not forgotten  
They were the heroes  
Who stood so tall  
And forever, we will remember  
With honor and glory,  
They gave their all  
Fallen, not forgotten  
They were the heroes  
Who stood so tall  
And forever, we will remember  
With honor and glory,  
With honor and glory,  
With honor and glory,  
They gave their all

He Is Great  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
I gave my heart to Jesus  
When I was just a child  
And though it seems like yesterday  
It's been quite a while  
I called upon the Savior  
I bowed my head and prayed  
That's the best decision  
That I ever made  
Every Sunday morning  
In a church outside of town  
Family, friends, and neighbors  
All would gather round  
When you neared the corner  
You could hear the church bell ring  
And when you reached the front door  
You could hear the people sing  
Chorus:  
He is great and greatly to be praised  
In a world that's changing  
He remains the same  
He is faithful  
He still saves  
Give your heart to Jesus  
And He'll wash your sins away  
I went home last summer  
And I tried to find my past  
But all I found were withered boards  
And panes of broken glass  
I thought about that chapel  
As I neared the edge of town  
I couldn't help but wonder  
If it was still around  
And do they sing  
Chorus  
I turned the corner  
And I looked on down the road  
Deep inside I thought it would be gone  
But there were people everywhere  
The parking lot was full  
You know the little church  
Was still going strong  
They had a revival going on

Here we are together  
Start of a new day

And all the things that You do  
I lift my voice  
And start praising You

You're such a good father to me  
Heavenly Father  
There's no place that I'd rather be  
Some days are much better  
Than the ones before  
But everyday I spend with You  
I love You that much more  
Even when I fail You  
And I try to turn and run  
You take my hand  
And I know I'm Your son  
Chorus  
The world rushes by  
Day after day  
There's so much to do  
There's no time to pray  
But I've found with You  
A joy that's complete  
Kneeling at Your feet

Here Comes A Miracle  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
They followed Him on dusty roads  
Wherever He would lead  
Multitudes would gather  
As He healed each disease  
With eyes of wonder they would watch  
As He would stop to pray  
And when He spoke the word of faith  
You could hear them say  
Chorus:  
Here comes a miracle  
Here comes a miracle  
Can't you feel it in the air?  
That look is on His face  
His glory is in this place  
And I know a miracle is near  
The lame could walk  
The deaf could hear  
Blinded eyes could see  
And those who had been  
Bound for years  
Were suddenly set free  
They came in desperation  
The hurting and the poor  
But when they saw Him  
Through the crowd  
They knew what was in store  
Chorus  
And still today we follow Him  
We claim His Word is true  
And nothing is impossible  
What He says He will do  
And though this world may doubt us  
And though they laugh and stare  
Someday all men will see the Truth  
When we see Him in the air

Here comes a miracle

Peace on earth goodwill to men

Gifts of love and guiding lights  
I believe it all began in Bethlehem

Lowly shepherds knelt to pray  
In a manager Jesus lay  
Shhhh sound asleep  
Angels singing in the sky  
Mother Mary at His side  
Precious gifts from far and wide  
At His feet  
I believe in Bethlehem  
Shining stars and making friends  
Peace on earth goodwill to men  
In all the world

I Go To The River  
Words by Ray Boltz and Brent Alan Henderson, Music by Ray Boltz, Brent Alan
Henderson, and Steve Millikan  
I have walked in a garden  
The morning after the rain  
I have watched in silent wonder  
As everything changed  
Oh, what a gift from the Father  
Is the Water of Life  
Like a river that flows  
Deep in my soul  
Its from an endless supply  
Chorus I:  
Where do I go  
When I'm thirsty and dry?  
I go to the river  
And I always find  
Rest for my soul  
Peace for my mind  
I go to the river  
When Jesus prayed in the garden  
His brow was furrowed with pain  
And what appeared to be drops of blood  
Were falling down like the rain  
He found strength for the journey  
He found it down on His knees  
And where He knelt a river flows  
And it flows for you and me

Chorus ii:  
What do I do  
When I'm covered with stains  
I go to the river and I wash them away  
Everythings new  
Everythings changed  
I go to the river  
Its a river of healing  
Its a river of faith  
Its a river of gladness  
Its a river of grace  
Its a river of mercy  
Its a river of love  
Its a river of freedom  
Its a river of blood

I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
I have heard how Christians long ago  
Were brought before a tyrant's throne  
They were told that he would spare their lives  
If they would renounce the name of Christ  
But one by one they chose to die  
The Son of God they would not deny  
Like a great angelic choir sings  
I can almost hear their voices ring  
  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
Now the years have come, and the years have gone  
But the cause of Jesus still goes on  
Now our time has come to count the cost  
To reject this world, to embrace the cross  
And one by one let us live our lives  
For the one who died to give us life  
Till the trumpet sounds on the final day  
Let us proudly stand and boldly say  
  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
To the Lamb of God who bore my pain  
Who took my place, who wore my shame  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb  
With all my strength, with all I am  
I will seek to honor His commands  
I pledge allegiance to the Lamb

I Still Love You  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
There's a fire in my heart tonight  
I feel it in my soul  
It's getting brighter every day  
Lord, you came into my life  
A long time ago  
And here I am tonight  
I've just got to say  
Chorus:  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I am not ashamed  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I'm here to praise Your name  
Some days I must confess  
The feelings aren't the same  
My heart just feels so very cold  
But Your hand of love and mercy  
Keeps me pressing on  
And even when I don't feel it  
Deep inside I know  
Chorus  
This world is full of promises  
None of them are true  
But Your word  
Will never pass away  
I want to follow You  
Chorus  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I am not ashamed  
I still love You  
I still love You  
I am not ashamed  
To praise Your name  
I still love You

I Think I See Gold  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
I see you struggling every day  
You think, How long  
Can I go on this way?  
On and on  
Again and again  
Oh, when will it end?  
You think, I just can't go on  
Much longer  
But inside, my friend,  
Your faith is growing stronger  
You feel the fire burning  
Deep in your soul  
But I want you to know  
Chorus:  
I think I see gold  
I think I see gold in the fire  
Right there in the ashes  
Is all you've desired  
Oh, it's hard  
As you press toward the goal  
Don't give up  
Don't give in  
Don't stop now  
I think I see gold  
Until this moment  
You've always believed  
When life grew darkest  
By faith you could see  
Open your eyes  
Look for the light  
You see, you were right  
These lonely hours  
Like a fire refining  
Something that's precious  
Something that's shining  
There in the darkness  
Surrounded by coals  
Is starting to glow  
Chorus

I Want To See  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan  
He sat in the darkness  
At the edge of the road  
He heard the crowd passing by  
But he couldn't go  
So he started crying  
Like a child at the door  
When they tried to quiet him  
He shouted it more  
Chorus:  
I want to see  
Free me from this darkness  
Sweeping over me  
I want to see  
Son of David, have mercy on me  
Now his heart was trembling  
Could this really be true?  
A voice in the darkness said,  
What do you want Me to do?  
Chorus  
Eyes opened in a moment of grace  
Light filled the skies  
One touch  
And he sees the face of life  
Now I'm like that blind man  
Who lived long ago  
I want to see Jesus  
And I just don't care who knows  
Chorus

I Wouldn't Go Back  
Words and Music by Lawrence Chewning  
I wouldn't go back, I wouldn't go back  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
I wouldn't go back  
I'm never going back again  
That's all behind me  
So don't you remind me  
It's all too vivid in my mind  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
I chose to leave it all behind  
Lead me on, lead me on  
Whatever it takes  
Oh Lord, lead me on  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
Before the night I knelt  
And asked God to forgive me  
Oh, the pain I felt, the tears I shed,  
The loneliness inside  
I wouldn't go back  
I wouldn't go back, not I  
I still recall that night one Fall  
How close I came to ending my life  
Just before You came  
Lying on my bed  
The ceiling over my head kept screaming,  
Who are you anyway?  
What could I say?  
Sitting in my living room  
Tears streaming down my face  
Life was such a waste 'til I met You  
Jesus! I wouldn't go back  
I wouldn't go back  
Never again, never again  
Never again, no  
I wouldn't go back  
To that life I used to live  
I wouldn't go back, I wouldn't go back  
I'll never go back  
I'll never go back  
I'm never going back again

Is There A Heaven For Me?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
She heard him preaching in the church  
She tried but she could not get in  
She was a lonely child on the street  
The wind was cold against her skin  
The wind was cold against her skin  
She heard the sound  
Of strange new words  
That someone else would then explain  
They spoke of heaven  
And a Saviors love  
They said that Jesus was His name  
Chorus:  
Is there a heaven for me?  
A place I wont be hungry or cold?  
That is a place that I would love to see  
Is there a heaven for me  
She waited patiently for hours  
Until at last she saw him leave  
He couldn't understand  
The words she said  
So he asked tell me what she needs  
Chorus (repeat)  
And on that street they knelt and prayed  
And on that night a child was saved  
Listen closely and you'll hear  
More than just a girl  
Youll hear the children of the world  
Youll hear the children of the world

Isaiah 53  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
All we like sheep have gone astray  
We've turned everyone to his own way  
And God laid all our iniquity on Him  
Like a lamb they led Him out  
Yet He opened not His mouth  
And His precious blood poured out  
An offering for sin  
Chorus:  
He was wounded for our transgressions  
He was bruised for our iniquities  
Our punishment was upon Him  
And by His stripes we are healed  
He had no beauty or majesty  
Clothed in lowly humanity  
And though we saw Him  
We could not see  
The glory of His grace  
But every law was satisfied  
The moment He laid down His life  
The power of death was destroyed  
The price was paid

It Won't Be Long  
Words by Ray Boltz, Steve Millikan, and Greg Gilpin, Music by Ray Boltz and
Steve Millikan  
When I got home from work last night  
The news was just coming on  
What a mess this world is in  
Everything's going wrong  
But I won't be discouraged  
I will not fear  
There's a voice inside my heart  
And this is what I hear  
Chorus:  
It won't be long till we see Jesus  
It won't be long till He'll be here  
I'm gonna follow Him all the way  
I'm gonna watch for Him every day  
With all that's going on  
It won't be long  
When I get up and start each day  
I turn it over to Him  
Oh you know I want to serve the Lord  
In any way that I can  
There's a world of people  
Everywhere I go  
They're lost and lonely  
Bound and afraid  
Oh and they need to know  
Chorus  
Jesus said before summer comes  
The leaves start turning green  
And He said before he returns  
We'd see lots of things  
Keep your eyes on the heavens  
And don't you be surprised  
When a trumpet sounds  
And we leave the ground  
And meet Him in the skies

Jesus Real Loud  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
The doors opened up  
And I got on the elevator  
I saw the other people  
Who were standing around  
Everyone was silent  
No one made a sound  
And I thought,  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
Hey!  
Chorus:  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
And did it now?  
Would you think I was a prophet?  
Would you still want me around?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I just lifted up my voice  
Above the crowd?  
Would you think I was a prophet?  
Would you think I was a clown?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
The doors opened up  
And I went in the dentist's office  
They handed me a magazine  
They told me to sit down  
Everyone was waiting  
No one made a sound  
And I thought,  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
Hey!  
Chorus  
It's ok sometimes to whisper  
But hey, listen to me mister  
The way we act can anybody tell?  
Lift your voice a little higher  
Smell the smoke and feel the fire  
Ain't it time somebody  
Started to yell?  
Chorus  
What if I said Jesus real loud?  
What if I said Jesus real loud?

Loving Each Other  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
But that doesn't mean  
That I can't love you  
You've found a place here in my heart  
So take my hand and we can start...  
CHORUS:  
Loving each other, loving the Lord  
Serving together in one accord  
There's no young or old here  
There's no rich or poor  
Loving each other, loving the Lord  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
He gave His life for me and for you  
We all have a place here in His heart  
So give me your hand and we will start...  
CHORUS  
The colors of the sunset  
Of eyes and of skin  
They were all created to glorify Him  
CHORUS  
Your eyes are brown  
My eyes are blue  
That doesn't mean I can't love you

My Father's Song  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
When I was just a little child  
We'd climb in this old family car  
And daddy would start to sing  
Before we rode very far  
I really don't remember  
If his songs were quite on key  
But that didn't matter to me  
It was my Father's song  
CHORUS:  
And he sings a song of love  
And a song of caring  
You sing it with your heart  
You sing it with your life  
And it's a song of giving  
Much more than you're asked  
And knowing that  
What you've done for Christ  
Is all that's going to last  
As I grew up I heard that song  
Time and time again  
A gentle word or a tender touch  
And that song would begin  
I can hear it in his laughter  
And it moves me more and more  
I can see it in his eyes  
When he talks about the Lord  
It's my Father's song  
And if I were the greatest musician  
Who ever walked upon a stage  
If I could sing any song I liked  
Any instrument I could play  
I wouldn't need a piano  
I wouldn't need a violin  
I'd choose a heart filled with his love  
And then I'd begin  
To sing my Father's song  
His song

Never Let You Fall  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
As you step into the unknown  
I know you're frightened  
You feel alone  
There's something you should understand  
You are my child  
You're in my hand  
Chorus:  
And I will never let you fall  
This is a promise to believe  
I will never let you fall  
Any further than your knees  
Now I hear you praying for a child  
You're so afraid they'll go wild  
Don't forget my love is true  
And I will carry them  
Like I've carried you  
And I will never let them fall  
This is a promise to believe  
I will never let them fall  
Any further than their knees  
Chorus

Never Lost  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
They saw the clouds on the horizon  
Nobody seemed to be concerned  
Jesus said they must cross the water  
Now He was sleeping in the stern  
Quick as the flash of summer lightning  
Caught on a sea of crashing waves  
Waking Him up and crying, Save us!  
They didn't need to be afraid  
CHORUS:  
Never lost  
He knows where you're going  
Never lost  
Even though the wind is blowing  
And there may be some stormy seas  
He says you must cross  
But with Jesus at your side  
You're never lost  
We used to rise and face the morning  
Like it was just another day  
But now we know that without warning  
How quickly everything can change  
It's like we're standing in a doorway  
And what lies beyond we cannot see  
As we step into the next moment  
Or into eternity  
CHORUS  
Mountains crumble  
And crash into the sea  
Kings and kingdoms do the same  
But if we place our trust  
In what we cannot see  
Our faith in Jesus will remain  
CHORUS (repeat)  
Never lost

Nobody's Home  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
This house is full of people  
But nobody's home  
They all live together  
But they're living life alone  
Everyone is searching  
For their own identity  
Missing all a family can be  
CHORUS:  
Nobody's home  
Can't you see the man and wife  
Who look so very sad?  
Nobody's home  
Can't you see the little boy  
Who needs his mom and dad?  
If they would only take a little time  
To love eadch other  
They would find the joy  
That they will never find alone  
When nobody's home  
This world is full of people  
But nobody's home  
The streets are always crowded  
But we walk through life alone  
Jesus is calling  
Asking us to change  
And we could be a family in His name  
Nobody's home  
Can't you see the man and wife  
Who look so very sad?  
Nobody's home  
Can't you see the little girl  
Who needs a mom and dad?  
If they would only take a little time  
To love eadch other  
They would find the joy  
That they will never find alone  
When nobody's home  
This house is full of people

Not Long Ago  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Not long ago you were happy  
There was a light in your eyes  
Not long ago how you loved Him so  
Remember when you  
Gave Him your life?  
Can you tell me what happened?  
Did your heart slowly grow cold?  
Did you give in to temptation  
And now you feel so alone?  
Chorus:  
When not long ago  
Seems so far away  
The journey begins  
The moment you pray  
Like a prodigal son  
It's time to come home  
To the One that you loved  
Not long ago  
Not long ago God gave us  
The gift of His own precious Son  
Not long ago, how He suffered so  
For all of the wrongs we have done  
If He suffered to save us  
If He would pay such a cost  
He'll put His arms around you  
And give you back what you've lost

I called out your name

You lifted me out of the mire

One Drop Of Blood  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Standing in the courtroom  
When I heard, how do you plead?  
The accuser of the brethren  
Was staring at me  
He said, we got your number  
There is no escape  
For here are your transgressions,  
Your failures and mistakes  
He pointed to the corner  
Where the scales of justice stood  
I saw so many failures there  
There was nothing good  
And in that very moment  
When it seemed all hope was lost  
I said, I plead the blood of Jesus  
And his death upon the cross  
Chorus:  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered my transgressions  
And all the times I failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
I stood and watched in silence  
As others were brought in  
I saw them start to tremble  
When they turned and faced their sin  
They offered no excuses  
They offered no alibis  
The truth was overwhelming  
And it would not be denied  
Their righteousness like filthy rags  
And nothing they could say  
They bowed their heads in silence  
As they were led away  
But for the true believers  
Each time it was the same  
His glory shown around them  
As they called upon his name  
One drop of blood  
Fell to the scales  
It covered their transgressions  
And all the times they failed  
The enemy was mighty  
He came in like a flood  
He was defeated by one drop of blood  
No greater sacrifice has any other made  
Oh yes he paid the price  
With every drop he gave  
Chorus (repeat 2X)  
1996 Shepherd Boy Musicascap (adm. By Word Music) and Weedom

In the heart of the believer  
Burns a fire for the soul  
To light the way  
And fight against the cold  
But if we all would gather  
Joining hearts in one accord  
The blaze would rise much higher  
United in the Lord  
  
[CHORUS:]  
One single flame  
An everlasting light  
Shining through the darkness  
Shattering the night  
A healing fire  
Lifting up the Saviors name  
May a world of true believers  
Burn one single flame  
  
Sometimes we put up boundaries  
With traditions from the past  
Its hard to move forward looking back  
For the Fathers kingdom  
We must set aside these walls  
Standing undivided  
Let us rise up for his call  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]  
Today and for the future  
Its burning brighter than before  
To those who come behind us  
Let us pass the torch  
  
[CHORUS (repeat)]

Power To Love  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Their leader was gone now  
Their number was few  
Left in the world full of hate  
They gathered together  
And started to pray  
All they could do now was wait  
That's when the power  
Came into the room  
Praise started filling the air  
Suddenly they were no longer afraid  
They felt His love everywhere  
Chorus:  
It's the power to love  
The power to reach out  
To someone in need  
It's the power to love  
The power to conquer  
This world full of greed  
There is no equal on earth  
Below or above  
We have the power to love  
It spread through the city  
And out in the street  
A multitude gathered around  
The power of heaven  
Was filling the earth  
It turned the whole world upside down  
People were singing  
And praising the Lord  
Laughter was filling the air  
Filled with His glorious  
Power and strength  
They took His word everywhere  
Chorus  
We will never lose  
We will conquer through love

Reigning  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
When You were born  
There lived a king  
And whatever he wanted  
His servants would bring  
His power seemed great  
To the people back then  
But his glory faded  
And Yours never will end  
Chorus:  
You are still reigning  
Glorious One  
Mighty Redeemer  
Gods precious Son  
Forever and ever, we worship you  
Jesus the King  
You are still reigning  
When Your return  
Unlike before  
Our eyes will see You,  
The glorious Lord  
All that we know  
Will suddenly change  
But even in heaven  
This is always the same  
Chorus  
You reign in power  
You reign in power and glory  
And You will reign forever  
And ever and ever and ever

Scars  
Words and music by Ray Boltz  
I heard Him call my name  
He said I've come to save you  
But I was so ashamed  
I turned to walk away  
He reached out His hand  
And said I have something to show you  
And what I saw changed my life that day  
  
I saw His scars  
No He didn't try to hide them  
He said, Come and look inside them  
They are a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
I knew it must be true  
I saw His scars  
  
I said Lord my scars are deep  
And I don't want You to see them  
So many of them were caused  
By things I chose to do  
He said, Look again  
At the ones that I am wearing  
Don't you know I chose these scars too?  
  
I saw His scars  
No He didn't try to hide them  
He said, Come and look inside them  
They are a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
I knew it must be true  
I saw His scars  
  
And one day in Heaven  
When we are on our knees  
We'll look up at Jesus  
And I believe we'll see  
We'll see His scars  
No, He will not try to hide them  
He'll say, Come and look inside them  
They're a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
And we'll know that it's true  
We'll see His scars  
We'll see His scars  
No He will not try to hide them  
He'll say, Come and look inside them  
They're a window to my heart  
And don't forget I love you  
Just the way you are  
Oh we'll know that it's true  
Because He died for me and you  
Oh we'll know that it's true  
We'll see His scars

I see a farmer in a field at dawn  
His land is crying out for the rain  
The year's been hard  
His crops are almost gone but he is not to blame  
The morning sun is climbing in the sky  
I see him smiling through the tears  
I wonder how can men like this survive  
But he's been here for years  
Seasons change, barren fields will bloom again  
Seasons change, gentle rains will fall  
Seasons change, better days will come and then  
You will find the blessing is worth the pain  
So just believe and let the seasons change  
I see a farmer in his field at dusk  
With joy he bring a harvest in  
The pride he feels  
Is in the one he trusts and he offers thanks to Him  
Seasons change, barren fields will bloom again  
Seasons change, gentle rains will fall  
Seasons change, better days will come and then  
You will find the blessing is worth the pain  
So just believe and let the seasons change  
Hearts grown cold  
May be warmed by the summer sun  
Dreams you hold  
May be closer than you know let the  
Seasons change, barren fields will bloom again  
Seasons change, gentle rains will fall  
Seasons change, better days will come and then  
You will find the blessing is worth the pain  
So just believe and let the seasons change  

One more time you've heard the story  
Of our Saviors birth  
Heard how few beheld His glory  
When He came to earth  
Oh but soon every eye shall see Him  
Angels at His side  
See Him now on a great white stallion  
In the eastern sky  
CHORUS:  
Sent by the Father  
Jesus go and call my children  
A trumpet sounds and the angels sing  
Like never before  
With shepherds and wise men  
We humbly bow  
And every tongue confess that He is Lord  
When He comes in all His glory  
Comes to claim His own  
We won't need a star to guide us  
Well be going home  
Once a baby in a manger  
No room at the inn  
Now a king who reigns forever  
Over death and sin  
CHORUS (repeat 2X)  

Shepherd Boy  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
One by one Jesse's sons  
Stood before the prophet  
Their father knew a king  
Would soon be found  
And each one passed  
Except the last  
No one thought to call him  
Surely he would never  
Wear a crown  
Chorus:  
But when others see a shepherd boy  
God may see a king  
Even though your life seems filled  
With ordinary things  
In just a moment He can touch you  
And everything will change  
When others see a shepherd boy  
God may see a king  
One by one problems come  
And dreams get shattered  
And sometimes it's hard  
To understand  
But things like chance  
And circumstance  
They don't really matter  
Our Father holds tomorrow  
In His hands  
Chorus  
Well it wasn't the oldest  
It wasn't the strongest  
Chosen on that day  
And yet the giants fell  
And nations trembled  
When they stood in his way  
Chorus

Someone Stood Up For Stephen  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
They grabbed a hold  
Of the preacher boy  
And drug him  
To the edge of the town  
With hate in their eyes  
And rocks in their hands  
They couldn't wait  
To knock him down  
They said,  
He's just another believer  
Getting ready to take a fall  
There's no one here  
Who can save him  
There's nobody here he can call  
chorus:  
But someone stood up for Stephen  
He wasn't standing alone  
Someone stood up for Stephen  
At the Father's throne  
The sky opened up  
And the clouds rolled away  
Stephen saw Jesus and then  
Someone stood up for Stephen  
When Stephen stood up for Him  
Stephen kept right on preaching  
He just wouldn't back down  
He was living for Jesus  
No matter who was around  
Oh, they just couldn't stop him  
Now matter how they tried  
Stephen knew that to live is Christ  
And Christians never die  
chorus  
Don't you know  
You can trust the Lord?  
His Holy Word is true  
If you stand up for Him  
I know He'll stand up for you

Stand Up  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Now when I was just a little child  
Enrolled in elementary school  
That big 'ol teacher  
Would ask me a question  
And I'd sit there  
Trembling like a fool  
So I asked my daddy,  
I said, What's wrong with me?  
He said, Son, if you know the answer  
This is how it's got to be  
He said  
Chorus:  
You've got to stand up  
And be counted  
You've got to raise your hand  
And let them call your name  
You've got to stand up  
If you want to be counted  
Lift your voice  
And don't ever be ashamed  
The next day at school  
The teacher asked a question  
And she shot a look my way  
And I stood right up  
And I said, Teacher  
There's something  
That I've got to say  
You know the grass below is green  
And the sky above is blue  
And Columbus found this country  
In 1492  
You need to stand up  
And be counted  
You've got to raise your hand  
And just let them call your name  
You've got to stand up  
If you want to be counted  
Lift your voice  
And don't ever be ashamed  
Now I believe the Lord  
He's looking for someone  
Who's gonna stand up  
For the Church  
And he wants you to stand up  
On the street  
And where you go to school  
And where you go to work  
And in a world filled with darkness  
That's surrounded by the night  
Someone needs to stand up for Jesus  
And start to shine that Light  
We need to stand up  
And be counted  
We need to raise our hands  
And start to praise His matchless Name  
We need to stand up  
If we want to be counted  
Lift your voice  
And don't ever, ever, ever  
Be ashamed-

Still Her Little Child  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
When she laid him in a manger  
He was still her little child  
In a city filled with strangers  
He was still her little child  
Though the inn was full  
And the night was cold  
She held Him close and smiled  
When she laid Him in a manger  
He was still her little child  
  
When the angels called Him Savior  
He was still her little child  
When the wise men gave Him treasures  
He was still her little child  
When the shepherds bowed before Him  
A star shone all the while  
When the angels called Him Savior  
He was still her little child  
  
When He grew in strength and wisdom  
He was still her little child  
When He spoke the people listened  
He was still her little child  
When He healed the lame and dying  
They would follow Him for miles  
And when he grew  
In strength and wisdom  
He was still her little child  
  
When the people turned against Him  
He was still her little child  
When they shouted crucify Him  
He was still her little child  
And when they nailed Him  
To a wooden cross  
Then we were reconciled  
When she held His broken body  
He was still her little child  
He was still her little child

The Altar  
Words and Music by Ray Boltz  
The service is nearing an end  
The choir is singing "Just As I Am"  
And now as the old song is played  
People at the altar  
Are kneeling down to pray  
Some are finding mercy  
Forgiveness for their sin  
Some are fighting battles  
And they're struggling to win  
The time has come  
To give them to the Lord  
That's what the altar is for  
Chorus:  
That's what this altar is for  
You don't have to carry  
Those burdens anymore  
There's a light in the darkness  
There's a love that's true  
And Jesus is waiting  
He is waiting here for you  
Go quickly now  
Before they close the door  
That's what the altar is for  
A father is praying with his son  
A mother kneels beside them  
Thanking God they've come  
An old man  
Is standing there in tears  
Giving up a part of him  
That he's held back for years  
Hearts are being broken  
Lives are being changed  
And those who call upon Him  
Will never be the same  
The time has come  
To give in to the Lord  
That's what this altar is for  
Chorus (repeat)  
Go quickly now  
Before they close the door  
And you can give your burdens  
To the Lord  
That's what this altar is for

The Bells Are Ringing  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
The high priest would move  
Through the temple  
With bells around the bottom of his skirt  
And as he prepared an offering there  
The sound of the bells could be heard  
Now there in the Holy of Holies  
A sinful priest surely would die  
But the sound of the bells sent a message  
To all those who waited outside  
chorus:  
The bells are ringing, He's alive  
Oh yes, the sacrifice is worthy  
A sound that cannot be denied  
The price has been paid  
And as our hands are being raised  
Let His holy name be praised  
Tell every nation, every tribe  
The bells are ringing, He's alive  
Now Jesus was born the Messiah  
A man sent to save other men  
And scripture proclaims,  
He is the high priest  
Who offered Himself for our sins  
And cold was the tomb  
Where they laid Him  
And there only silence was found  
But on the third day  
The stone rolled away  
And the whole world  
Woke up to the sound  
chorus  
Open up your heart and listen  
Tell me what do you hear  
It's the sound of salvation  
Ringing He's alive  
And there's no need to fear  
chorus (repeat)  
In every nation, in every tribe  
The bells are ringing, He's alive

I've had my share  
Of life's ups and downs  
But you've been good to me  
The downs have been few  
I guess some would say  
That I've been lucky  
Oh but I've got to say  
That it's all because of you  
  
[CHORUS:]  
If anyone should ever write  
My life's story  
For whatever reason there might be  
You'd be there  
Between each line of pain and glory  
'Cause you're the best thing  
That ever happened to me  
  
There have been times  
When times were hard  
But always somehow  
I made it through  
'Cause for every moment  
I spent hurting  
There was a moment  
I spent just loving you

The Gospel Of Grace  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Greg Gilpin and Ray Boltz  
They say in the harbor of heaven  
Is a ship called the Gospel of Grace  
A glorious ship, that once made a trip  
Through the oceans of time and space  
She followed a star to a stable  
She carried the Child of the King  
And when she set sail  
So goes the tale  
All of the angels would sing  
Chorus:  
The Gospel of Grace is sailing  
What a glorious sight to behold  
Her heavenly banners are waving  
Her sails are covered with gold  
They say when a man looks upon her  
The glory will shine on his face  
For therell never be  
A ship on the sea  
Like the glorious Gospel of Grace  
She sailed to the land of the lonely  
To the meek and the lowly she came  
And each one she passed  
From the first to the last  
Would never again be the same  
The voice of the Father had spoken  
A heavenly sign had come down  
And everyone knew  
His promise was true  
The heavens were filled with the sound  
Chorus  
Then one day she sank to the bottom  
At a place called old rugged cross  
But the Child of the King,  
Now her captain  
Came sailing her back to the top  
And then as they sailed  
Off toward heaven  
He called out, Get ready my friends  
I must go away, but therell come a day  
I promise youll see Me again  
And the Gospel of Grace will be sailing  
What a glorious sight well behold  
Her heavenly banners a waving  
Shes coming to carry us home  
For now we see through a glass darkly  
But then we will see face to face  
And as we climb aboard  
Well give thanks to the Lord  
For His glorious Gospel of Grace  
And as we climb aboard  
Well give thanks to the Lord  
For H

I was in the crowd  
The day that Jesus died  
And as He hung upon the cross  
His mother cried  
I saw the crown of thorns He wore  
The stripes upon His back  
The water and the blood ran out  
And then the sky turned black  
My mind was filled with anger  
My heart was filled with shame  
This man brought only healing  
Who could bring Him pain  
Why does it seem the strong  
Always victimize the weak?  
And suddenly I found myself  
Standing to my feet  
And I cried, "Who nailed Him there?  
This Child of peace and mercy  
Who nailed Him there?  
Come and face me like a man  
Who nailed Him there?"  
And the crowd began to mock me  
I cried, "Oh my God, I do not understand"  
Then I turned and saw the hammer  
In my hand  
I am just a Roman soldier  
An ordinary man  
I love my wife and children  
I do the best I can  
How could I have killed Him?  
It must be someone else  
There's got to be an answer  
I just can't blame myself  
And I cried, "Who nailed Him there?  
This Child of peace and mercy  
Who nailed Him there?  
Come and face me like a man  
Who nailed Him there?"  
And the crowd began to mock me  
I cried, "Oh my God, I do not understand"  
Then I turned and saw the hammer  
In my hand  
I nailed Him there  
The child of peace and mercy  
I nailed Him there  
I am the guilty man  
I nailed Him there  
With my sins and my transgressions  
I cried, "Oh my God, now I understand  
When I turned and saw the hammer in my hand"  

Today I faced  
A world of compromise  
I had to fight to stand my ground  
One day I'll leave these struggles  
Far behind  
I will gladly lay them down  
  
[Chorus]  
When we get there  
His voice we'll hear  
Slowly each name He'll call  
When He calls to me  
I will fall to my knees  
And He'll see  
The last time I fall  
  
I only dream  
Of how it's going to be  
But I'll keep fighting until then  
When every loss  
And every victory  
Will be offered unto Him  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Truth has conquered every lie  
Love demands no alibis  
Life has loved us  
Loved enough to die  
  
[Chorus]

The Last To Be Chosen  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Today in the school yard  
They were choosing up sides  
And one child just stood there  
With tears in his eyes  
He'd been there before  
And everyone knew  
He'd be alone  
When the choosing was through  
But high in the heavens  
The Father looked down  
And He saw what happened  
There on the ground  
And angels rejoiced  
When He said to His son,  
Watch what I do with this one  
chorus:  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
And what He does through them  
Will amaze one and all  
It won't be the hero  
That carries the ball  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
Now don't be discouraged  
And don't be afraid  
God is not worried  
With the choice that He made  
Others may laugh or doubt at the start  
But He sees what's there in your heart  
chorus  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call  
And what He does through them  
Will amaze one and all  
Standing for Jesus when others may fall  
The last to be chosen  
Are the first He will call (repeat)

The ornaments are ready  
The place has been prepared  
Strings of lights and holly  
Are draped across the chair  
The family's all together  
I know where they must be  
Everyone is searching  
For the perfect tree  
  
Chorus:  
The perfect tree  
Grew very long ago  
And it was not decked with silver  
Or with ornaments of gold  
But hanging from it's branches  
Was a gift for you and me  
Jesus laid His life down  
On the perfect tree  
  
Mother wants a straight one  
The children want it tall  
Dad just hopes that somehow  
He can get it down the hall  
Soon they'll gather round it  
As proud as they can be  
But when they're looking at it  
I wonder if they see  
  
Chorus (repeat)

Sometimes the truth is lost  
That every step this baby took  
Brought Him closer to the cross

Lord, You've touched my heart today  
That is why I've come to pray  
You see all I have inside  
All the things I try to hide  
Jesus, I believe that You are there  
And You're listening to this sinner's prayer  
Touch this broken heart and make it new  
I believe in You  
Please forgive me for my sin  
All I've done and all I've been  
Serving You forevermore  
Everyday You'll be my Lord  
Jesus, I believe that You are there  
And You're listening to this sinner's prayer  
Knowing You'll remember what You've heard  
I believe Your word  
In Your name this prayer will end  
And a new life will begin  
Now I know, I'm not alone  
Hold my hand and lead me home  

Thrown Away  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Grandpa and me, every week or so  
Wed go walking down a country road  
Looking for something  
Others drove right past  
Maybe they were late  
And they were dogging the throttle  
Maybe they just  
Didnt notice the bottles  
Shining like diamonds in the grass  
We would pick them up  
And wed cash 'em in  
Hed look at me and Id look at him  
And hed say  
CHORUS:  
Thrown away  
Can you believe the things  
They toss aside  
And leave em where they lay?  
Oh, but they can be saved  
If you will take the time  
And try to find the good  
Along the way  
Oh, what this world throws away  
Many years later  
When my age had doubled  
I met a man and his name was Trouble  
He said, Son, Ill give you some advice  
A family is fine  
And theres a time you need them  
But sure enough there will come  
A time to leave em  
You know you only get one life  
He was a lonely man  
Without a single friend  
He looked at me and I looked at him  
And I said,  
CHORUS  
And maybe someday  
When the little ones have grown  
I may have a grandchild of my own  
And if I do, I can promise you  
One day well walk down a country road

A woman came to Simon's house,  
She knew the Lord was there,  
For when she walked into the room  
She was greeted by a stare,  
She surely must have shocked a few  
Of the people gathered there,  
As with tear-filled eyes  
And trembling hands  
She took down her long dark hair,  
And from an alabaster vessel  
Precious ointment filled her hair,  
As she wept she kissed his feet  
And began anointing them.  
Chorus  
With her hands, she was touching him,  
The alpha the omega,  
The beginning and the end,  
And with her hands  
She was holding on to His,  
The source of life  
Was right there in her hands.  
Now Simon said within his heart,  
Lord if you only knew the kind of woman  
That's touching you,  
But Jesus knew about her past,  
He knew about the sin,  
Yet He saw in her a repentant heart  
That had come to worship Him.  
Chorus  
Now tell me why do we gather  
Together in His name,  
Are we like the ones who merely watched,  
Tell me is that why we came,  
Are we like this sister,  
Do we truly enter in,  
In spirit and in truth,  
Have you come to worship Him.  
With your hands, are you touching him,  
And with your heart are you loving Him,  
And with your hands  
Are you holding on to His,  
Then source of life  
Was right there in your hands.

Until All Have Been Served  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
Brother and sisters sharing communion  
Holding the bread of life in their hands  
In just a few hours theyd be going home  
Serving the Lord in faraway lands  
When someone said,  
Has everyone been served?  
This is what was heard  
Chorus:  
No, no, not everyone has been served  
No, no, we need to  
Take them to his word  
How can they know him  
When theyve never heard?  
No, no, not everyone has been served  
With tears in their eyes  
They prayed for the cities  
Where millions of people suffer each day  
They live and they die  
Never knowing why  
No one is there to show them the way  
And the Father says,  
Has everyone been served?  
For so long He has heard  
Chorus (repeat)  
We are the light and we know the truth  
Can we forget what were called to do?  
No, no, not until all have been served  
No, no, we need to  
Take them to his word  
In every nation let this cry be heard  
No, no, not until all have been served  
No, no, not until all have been served  
No, no, we need to  
Take them to his word  
In every nation, let this cry be heard  
No, no, not until all have been served

What Are We Doing Here?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Last days, big city  
What a place to live  
High rise accommodations  
Are so executive  
Real life, just around the corner  
Take a walk aroung the block  
Pass by a family in the alley  
Sleeping in a paper box  
Chorus:  
What are we doing here?  
Do we spend our time  
Waiting on heaven?  
What are we doing here?  
Should we pack our bags  
The moment we're forgiven?  
Oh, there's a world  
That needs to know  
Jesus loves them so  
His commission seems quite clear  
What are we doing here?  
They say we are pilgrims  
Just passing through  
Strangers in a strange land  
That's me and you  
One day we'll be up in glory  
Walking on streets of gold  
But right now my feet  
Are on the pavement  
And I just want to know  
Chorus  
I see a starving brother  
In a foreign land  
I see a homeless child  
Reaching out his hand  
I see a world so angry  
I can feel the rage  
I see a city dying  
Filled with crack cocaine  
I hear the lions roar  
The tires squeal  
A generation saying what is real  
If we know the truth  
If we know the way  
There ought to be something  
We can do or say  
We need to make a stand  
Take a walk  
Win this city,  
Do it block by block  
Stand up tall  
And preach it without fear  
If we won't do it  
Then what are we doing here?

What If I Give All?  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Ray Boltz and Mark Pay  
He heard the preacher say  
A single dime can feed  
A hungry boy or girl  
With nothing to eat  
So he pulled a dollar  
From the pocket of his jeans  
And he asked his mama  
How many will this feed?  
She just smiled  
And when she told him ten  
He reached back again  
chorus:  
What if I give all I have?  
What will that gift do?  
My child, a gift like that  
Could change the world  
It could feed a multitude  
He didn't close his eyes  
Or turn away  
I can see him standing tall  
He saw the need  
And I can hear him say  
What if I give all  
Three birthday dollars  
Could have bought a special toy  
But he reminds me  
Of another little boy  
Who gave to Jesus  
A gift of fish and bread  
I wonder if he said  
chorus (repeat)  
And long ago a Father and a Son  
Saw the children lost in sin  
Can you see the tears  
In the Fathers eyes  
As Jesus says to him  
What if I gave all I have?  
What will that gift do?  
My Son, that gift  
Will change the world  
It will free the multitudes  
What if I give all I have?  
What will that gift do?  
My child a gift like that  
Could change the world  
It could feed a multitude  
We cannot close our eyes  
And turn away  
When we hear His Spirit call  
We see the need  
Now let Him hear us say  
What if I give all?  
What if I give all?

Jesus walked upon the earth,  
On the shores of Galilee,  
He'd say to His disciples,  
Let the little children come to me,  
I wonder if up in heaven,  
Do you suppose we'll see  
Little children asking  
What was I supposed to be.  
Chorus  
What was I supposed to be,  
What were my eyes supposed to see,  
And why did I taste of death  
Before I even drew a breath,  
Laid my head at my mother's breast,  
To sleep.  
Oh Jesus,  
Chorus  
Was I to be a prophet  
Used in the ministry,  
A doctor who would find a cure  
For some terrible disease,  
Even if I'd been born imperfect  
Why couldn't my parents see,  
That I'd have been made perfect  
When you came back for me.  
Oh Jesus  
Chorus  
Oh Jesus, what was I supposed to be,  
Oh Jesus, what was I supposed to be

When He Calls  
Words and music by Ray Boltz and Steve Millikan  
In a land far away  
A little boy lay  
Asleep in his bed  
Then he heard a voice call  
There was no doubt at all  
He knew just what it said  
He had heard it before  
And he could not ignore  
What he thought  
Was too good to be true  
For the words of a wise man  
Had opened his eyes  
And he knew what he needed to do  
chorus:  
When He calls  
When He calls  
Just say, Lord, I am listening  
When He calls  
When He calls  
Just be ready to obey  
For there's no greater joy  
Than hearing Him call your name  
Well, the little boy's gone  
But life still goes on  
Day after day  
And if God spoke back then  
He can do it again  
In a nuclear age  
Have you heard it before  
And just chose to ignore  
What your mind thought  
Was only a dream  
If He's speaking to you  
This is what you should do  
And it's not quite  
As strange as it seems  
chorus (repeat)

When Her Eyes Are On The Child  
Words by Ray Boltz, Music by Steve Millikan and Ray Boltz  
Theres a mother whose name is Mary  
And shes traveled very far  
But shes not thinking  
About her journey now  
Theres a baby in her arms  
And when her eyes are on the child  
She finds all the strength she needs  
All the struggles and the trials  
Just turn into perfect peace  
She can even stop and smile  
When her eyes are on the child  
Theres a soldier whose name is Terry  
And hes serving far from home  
Its the first time  
That hes spent Christmas  
Far away and all alone  
And when his eyes are on the child  
He finds all the strength he needs  
All the struggles and the trials  
Just turn into perfect peace  
He can even stop and smile  
When his eyes are on the child  
Theres a world of lonely people  
Chasing love and chasing styles  
Oh but how different their lives could be  
With their eyes upon the child  
And when our eyes are on the child  
We find all the strength we need  
All the struggles and the trails  
Just turn into perfect peace  
We can even stop and smile  
When our eyes are on the child  
We can even stop and smile  
When our eyes are on the child
