I was sittin' on a bar stool  
In a barbecue joint in Tennessee  
When this old boy walked in  
And he sat right down next to me  
  
I could tell he'd been through some hard times  
There were tear stains on his old shirt  
And he said, "You wanna know what you get  
When you play a country song backwards?"  
  
You get your house back  
You get your dog back  
You get your best friend Jack back  
You get your truck back  
  
You get your hair back  
You get your first and second wives back  
Your front porch swing  
Your pretty little thing  
  
Your bling, bling, bling and a diamond ring  
You get your farm, and the barn  
And the boat, and the Harley  
First night in jail with Charlie  
  
It sounds a little crazy  
A little scattered and absurd  
But that's what you get  
When you play a country song backwards  
  
Well, I never heard it said quite like that  
It hit me in the face 'cause that's where I'm at  
I almost fell flat out on the floor  
He said, "Wait a minute, that's not all  
There's even more."  
  
You get your mind back  
You get your nerves back  
Your first heart attack back  
You get your pride back  
  
You get your life back  
You get your first real love back  
You get your big screen TV, a DVD  
And a washing machine  
  
You get the pond, and the lawn  
And the bail, and the mower  
You go back where you don't know her  
It sounds a little crazy  
  
A little scattered and absurd  
But that's what you get  
When you play a country song backwards  
Oh play that song!  
  
We sat there and shot the bull  
About how it would be  
If we could turn it all around  
And change this C-R-A-P  
  
You get your house back  
You get your dog back  
You get your best friend Jack back  
You get your truck back  
  
You get your hair back  
You get your first and second wives back  
Your front porch swing  
Your pretty little thing  
  
Your bling, bling, bling and a diamond ring  
You get your farm, and the barn  
And the boat, and the Harley  
First night in jail with Charlie  
You get your mind back  
  
You get your nerves back  
Your first heart attack back  
You get your pride back  
You get your life back  
  
You get your first real love back  
You get your big screen TV, a DVD  
And a washing machine  
You get the pond, and the lawn  
  
And the bail, and the mower  
You go back where you don't know her  
It sounds a little crazy  
A little scattered and absurd  
  
But that's what you get  
When you play a country song backwards

When I lose my smile  
When my thoughts get jumbled  
When the air and b.s. get too thick  
Can't take a breath without getting sick  
I've had enough with this concrete jungle  
I drop my truck in drive  
I pick up my baby  
She jumps in with a kiss and a hey  
We exit off that old highway  
Sometimes you gotta go beyond the pavement  
  
[Chorus]  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
You gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Crickets and frogs  
Yeah you're gettin' close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go and you go-go-go  
'Til you hear a banjo, ah there it is  
  
It ain't on no map  
And I'm glad it isn't  
Leave the phone and the GPS,  
Those satellites ain't found it yet,  
Got our own little piece of heaven hidden  
  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
You gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Crickets and frogs  
Yeah you're gettin' close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go and you go, go, go, go  
'Til you hear that banjo, yeah woo  
  
You gotta go deep  
Way on back  
Cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
Hell you gotta get lost  
Way on out  
Yeah crickets and frogs  
Hey you're gettin' close now  
And you kick it into four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go and you go, and you go, and you go, and you go, woo oo  
'Til you hear that banjo, kick it  
  
Gotta go deep  
A way on back  
Yeah cross a few creeks  
And a couple little shacks  
Four wheel drive when you run out of road  
And you go, and you go, and you go  
'Til you hear that, 'til you hear that, 'til you hear that banjo  
  
That's nice  
Let's go  
Kick that thing into four wheel drive  
Let's go  
'Til you hear that  
  
Until you hear that banjo  
Until you hear that banjo

If I had one call to make  
I would dial yesterday and warn myself  
Tell my lips the words to say  
Not let you just walk away  
With someone else  
With someone else  
  
[Chorus]  
Next time, I wont suffer this kind of pain  
Own my mistakes  
Not just pass off all the blame  
If you were here, we could figure this out  
Then I wouldn't be bitter  
I'd just be better now  
  
To be the strong and silent one  
A lot of good that has done  
Yes, you'd agree  
No more tryin' to understand  
Or fix these things because you can  
Guess it's up to me  
Yeah, it's up to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd be much better off  
Much better off, maybe  
If I could just let it go  
With no regrets then  
  
[Chorus]  
Next time, I won't suffer this kind of pain  
Own my mistakes  
Not just pass off all the blame  
You'd still be here,and we'd figure this out  
Then I wouldn't be better (I wouldn't be better)  
Oh, no I wouldn't be bitter  
I'd just be better now  
  
Oh

I set out on a narrow way many years ago  
Hoping I would find true love along the broken road  
But I got lost a time or two  
Wiped my brow and kept pushing through  
I couldn't see how every sign pointed straight to you  
  
That every long lost dream lead me to where you are  
Others who broke my heart, they were like northern stars  
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms  
This much I know is true  
That God blessed the broken road  
That led me straight to you  
Yes it did  
  
I think about the years I spent just passing through  
I'd like to have the time I lost and give it back to you  
But you just smile and take my hand  
You've been there you understand  
It's all part of a grander plan that is coming true  
  
Every long lost dream led me to where you are  
And others who broke my heart they were like northern stars  
Pointing me on my way into your loving arms  
This much I know it's true  
That God blessed the broken road  
That led me straight to you  
Yeah  
  
And now I'm rolling home  
Into your loving arms  
This much I know is true  
That God blessed the broken road  
That led me straight to you  
  
That God blessed the broken road  
Ooh, ooh  
That led me straight to you

Bob that head  
Awwh, awwh, ah  
Yeah yeah, yeah,yeah  
  
Tricked out truck kit  
Runnin' boards black lit  
KC roll bar  
Had to mow an extra yard  
Just so he could  
Install satellite  
Rascal Flattin'all night  
King cab, bass tubes  
Stop light, boom-boom  
Five days, all week  
Two jobs so he can  
  
[Chorus]  
Bob that head  
Every Friday night  
Got the windows rolled down  
The seat reclined  
Givin' everybody that rock on sign

It's just another simple voice mail message  
I'll pick you up and we'll do dinner by the fire  
And we'll watch it snow  
It's from a year ago  
Baby I love you and I can't wait to see you tonight  
I've been thinking 'bout you all day long  
She pushes nine to save  
She still can't erase  
  
'Cause it makes her feel close  
Makes her smile it's like he's with her almost  
Till the tears take over she's still in hell  
But she tells herself she's ready to let him go  
Cause that makes her feel close  
  
It's just a worn out Notre Dame t-shirt  
She's gotten mad and tried to throw  
That thing away at least a hundred times  
But she's got it on tonight  
He used to wear it on the weekend just running around  
Probably he forgot he even left it behind  
She says it keeps her warm  
Oh, but it's so much more  
  
It makes her feel close  
Makes her smile it's like he's with her almost  
Till the tears take over  
She's still in hell  
But she tells herself  
She's ready to let him go  
Cause that makes her feel close  
  
Just sayin' goodbye  
Getting on with her life  
Maybe give love another try  
One more try  
One more try  
  
It makes her feel close  
Makes her smile it's like he's with her almost  
Till the tears take over  
She's still in hell  
But she tells herself  
She's ready to let him go  
'Cause that makes her feel close

I can usually drink you right off of my mind  
But I miss you tonight  
I can normally push you right out of my heart  
But I'm too tired to fight  
  
Yeah the whole thing begins  
And I let you sink into my veins  
And I feel the pain like it's new  
Everything that we were,  
Everything that you said,  
Everything that I did and that I couldn't do  
Plays through tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With every word it grows higher and higher  
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back  
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming  
Come wake me up  
  
Turn the TV up loud just to drown out your voice  
But I can't forget  
Now I'm all out of ideas  
And baby I'm down to my last cigarette  
  
Yeah you're probably asleep deep inside of your dreams  
While I'm sitting here crying and trying to sleep  
Yeah wherever you are baby now I am sure you've moved on  
And aren't thinking twice about me and you tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With everyone it grows higher and higher  
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back  
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming  
  
I know that you're movin' on  
I know I should give you up  
But I keep hopin' that you'll trip and fall back in love  
  
Time's not healin' anything  
Baby this pain is worse than it ever was  
I know that you can't hear me but baby I need you to save me tonight  
  
Tonight your memory burns like a fire  
With everyone it grows higher and higher  
I can't get over it, I just can't put out this love  
I just sit in these flames and pray that you'll come back  
Close my eyes tightly, hold on and hope that I'm dreaming  
Come wake me up  
Oh I'm dreaming  
Come wake me up  
Oh, I'm dreaming

We broke up  
Yeah, it's tough  
Most guys would've been crushed  
Wastin' their time  
Wonderin' where they went wrong  
No way, not me  
Hey, I'm doing just fine  
I'm not afraid to move on  
  
It's easy going out on a Friday night  
Easy, every time I see her out  
I can smile, live it up  
The way a single guy does  
But what she, what she don't know  
Is how hard it is to make it look so  
Easy  
  
The truth is  
That I miss lyin' in those arms of his  
But I don't ever let it show  
I laugh and I act like  
I'm having the time of my life  
As far as he knows  
  
It's easy goin' out on a Friday night  
Easy, every time I see him out  
I can smile, live it up  
Like a single girl does  
But, what he, what he don't know  
Is how hard it is to make it look so  
Easy  
Oh, it's easy  
  
Oh, it's easy goin' out on a Friday night  
Oh, it's easy every time I see him out  
I can smile, live it up  
Forget about the way it was  
But what she  
Oh, what he don't know  
What she don't know  
Is how hard it is to make it look so  
Easy  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, and it's so easy, it's so easy  
Yeah, ooh, ooh

You could've bowed down gracefully  
But you didn't  
You knew enough to know  
To leave well enough alone  
  
But you wouldn't  
I drive myself crazy  
Tryin' to stay out of my own way  
The messes that I make  
  
But my secrets are so safe  
The only one who gets me  
Yeah, you get me  
It's amazing to me  
  
[Chorus]  
How every day  
Every day, every day  
You save my life  
  
I come around all broken down and  
Crowded out  
And you're comfort  
Sometimes the place I go  
Is so deep and dark and desperate  
I don't know, I don't know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I swear, I don't know if  
I'm comin' or goin'  
But you always say something  
Without even knowin'  
  
That I'm hangin' on to your words  
With all of my might and it's alright  
Yeah, I'm alright for one more night-  
Every day  
  
Every day, every day, every day  
Every day, every day  
You save me, you save me, oh, oh, oh  
Every day  
Every, every, every day-  
  
Every day you save my life

When you're ready for love  
And you've conquered your fear  
And you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
When you've had enough hurt  
And you're tired of the tears  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
You're broken and jaded  
Say love's overrated  
But I say girl ain't that a shame?  
With all that he put you through  
I can't really blame you  
But don't let some fool give us all a bad name  
  
When you're ready for love  
And you've conquered your fear  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
When you've had enough hurt  
And you're tired of the tears  
If you wanna fall baby  
Fall here  
  
Fall here  
Right into my world (right into my world)  
Let me catch you, girl  
Let me be the one  
Let me be the one  
  
When you're ready for love  
When you're ready for love  
If you wanna fall I won't let you down girl  
Oh baby let go  
  
When you're ready for love  
And you've conquered your fear  
And you're tired of the tears  
Baby fall, baby fall here  
Yeah, baby fall here  
Oh, baby fall here

There's no gravity up here  
It's kind of hard to explain  
Every time I'm holding you  
It's like backwards rain, yeah  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you, I'm floating and  
Flying around  
Your love's like fallin' upside down  
  
You've got me so lightheaded  
It's a dizzy mood  
Spinning uncontrollably  
And gaining altitude  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you, I'm floating and  
Flying around  
Your love's like fallin' upside down  
  
Look at me  
Used to be, I could keep my feet  
On the ground  
When you said you could take  
Me higher  
You weren't playing around  
(You weren't playing around)  
  
You lift me up like a kite on a string  
Like a bird on newfound wings  
So high on you, I'm floating and  
Flying around  
Your love's like fallin' upside down

Woke up this morning  
With this feeling inside me that I can't explain  
Like a weight that I've carried  
Been carried away, away  
  
But I know something is coming  
I don't know what it is  
But I know it's amazing, can save me  
My time is coming  
And I'll find my way out of this longest drought  
  
[Chorus]  
It feels like today I know it feels like today  
I'm sure it's the one thing that's missin'  
The one thing I'm wishin'  
Life's sacred blessin' in me  
It feels like today I know  
Feels like today  
  
You treat life like a picture  
But it's not a moment that's frozen in time  
It's not gonna wait  
Til you make up your mind, at all  
  
So while this storm is breakin'  
While there's light at the end of the tunnel  
Keep running towards it  
Releasing the pressure, that's my heartache  
Soon this dam will break  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feels like, feels like your life changes  
Feels like, feels like your life changes  
  
It's the one thing that's missin'  
The one thing you're wishin'  
Life's sacred blessin'  
It feels like today I know  
  
Feels like, feels like your life changes  
Feels like, feels like your life changes

Alarm clock, ding-dong, pants up, boots on  
Coffee, cigarette, blue-collar breakfast  
Hard hat, fork lift, dragging through a swing shift  
Stacking up the boxes, watching that clock  
Tick tock, tick tock, tick tock, tick tock  
Working for the man sure makes a man thirsty  
Need a little neon, get a little drink on  
Friday can't come fast enough y'all  
  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Let the good times roll when the guitars play  
Here's to another week gone  
Raise 'em up and sing along  
Friday can't come fast enough  
  
Baby's on the cell phone, calling from a tanning bed  
Hit the mall, got a dress, nails done, hair did  
Running through my money, like a water through a faucet  
Well so dry you can here those dollars  
Drip drop, drip drop, drip drop, drip drop  
Payin' them bills sure make a man thirsty  
Need a little neon, time to get a drink on,  
Friday can't come fast enough  
  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Let the good times roll when the guitars play  
Here's to another week gone  
Raise 'em up and sing along  
Friday can't come fast enough  
  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
Na-na, na-na-na, na  
  
We need a little neon  
Time to get your drink on  
Friday can't come fast enough  
Here's to another week gone  
Raise 'em up and sing along  
Friday can't come fast enough  
(Yeah, friday can't come fast enough)

From time to time I have regrets  
For all the things I didn't say  
That were on my list  
From time to time my memory slips  
But you're the one thing in my life  
I won't forget  
  
There'll never be minute of the day  
I won't think of you  
My feelings are so strong in me  
I feel it through and through  
There'll never be a night that's so dark that we won't shine  
Or a dream that we've lost that we can't find  
You'll always be, oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
  
There'll never be minute of the day  
I won't think of you  
My feelings are so strong in me  
I feel it through and through  
There'll never be a night that's so dark that we won't shine  
Or a dream that we've lost that we can't find  
You'll always be, oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
  
You'll always be, oh the one for me  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between  
Oooo, yeah  
  
You'll always be, Oooo the one for me  
From time to time  
And in between yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah I do  
I think of you from time to time  
And in between, yeah

God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heavenly father  
The blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The Son of God by name  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
Fear not said the angel  
Let nothing you affright  
This day is born a savior  
Of the pure virgin bright  
To free all those who trust in him  
From Satan's power and might  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
And when they came to Bethlehem  
Where our dear savior lay  
They found him in the manger  
Where oxen feed on hay  
His mother Mary knelled down  
And to the Lord did pray  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
God rest ye merry gentlemen  
Let nothing you dismay  
Remember Christ our savior  
Was born on Christmas day

They tried their best to drag him out  
Of a courthouse down in Montgomery  
And now they wanna kick him out of school  
And take him off our money  
They can take those words off of paper and stone  
But he ain't gone, no  
  
[Chorus]  
He ain't the leavin' kind  
He'd never walk away  
Even from those who don't believe  
And wanna leave him behind  
He ain't the leavin' kind  
  
She stayed mad at him for a lot of years  
For takin' her husband  
Started losin' her faith and thinkin' that her life meant nothin'  
But when she looks at those kids she raised all by herself  
She knows she had some help, yeah, she knows  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No matter what you do  
No matter where you go  
He's always right there with you  
  
Even from those you don't believe  
And wanna leave him behind  
He ain't the leavin' kind  
No, no  
  
(He ain't the leavin'...  
He ain't the leavin' kind)  
He ain't the leavin'...  
(He ain't the leavin'...  
  
He ain't the leavin' kind  
He ain't the leavin' kind)  
(He ain't the leavin'...  
He ain't the leavin' kind)  
He ain't the leavin' kind

I know that you're leavin'  
As soon as the sun  
Comes through the window  
There's no talking this over  
The damage is done  
There's just too much hurt  
Too much to forgive  
Oh, but we both know  
We weren't always like this  
  
[Chorus:]  
Help me remember  
The way that we used to be  
When nothin' else mattered  
"cause you were lovin' me  
Just for the night, one last time  
One more good memory  
When I look back  
That's what I wanna see  
  
Oh, help me remember  
  
Those days that were so good  
Those nights that we held  
Held on forever  
When we weren't pretenders  
We were as real as we felt  
Oh, I don't want to fight anymore  
Don't want the last thing I hear tonight  
To be a slammin' door  
Baby, let it be like before  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This could be the last time  
I look in your eyes  
  
Help me remember  
The way that it used to be  
When nothin' else mattered  
'Cause you were lovin' me  
Oh, help me remember  
Oh, help me, help me  
Oh, oh, oh, oh-

There's a place I've been lookin' for  
That took me in and out of buildings  
Behind windows, walls and doors  
And I thought I found it  
Couple times, even settled down  
And I'd hang around just long enough  
To find my way back out  
I know now the place that I was trying to reach  
Was you, right here in front of me  
  
[Chorus]  
And I wouldn't change a thing  
I'd walk right back through the rain  
Back to every broken heart  
On the day that it was breakin'  
And I'd relive all the years  
And be thankful for the tears  
I've cried with every stumbled step  
That led to you and got me here, right here  
  
It's amazing what I let my heart go through  
To get me where it got me  
In this moment here with you  
And it passed me by  
God knows how many times  
I was so caught up in holding  
What I never thought I'd find  
I know now, there's a million roads  
I had to take  
To get me in your arms that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a love I never thought I'd get to get to here  
And if that's the road  
God made me take to be with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'd relive all the years  
And be thankful for all the tears  
I've cried with every stumbled step  
That led to you and got me here, right here  
Oh, baby ohh  
Oh, got me here

I can hear the truck tires coming up the gravel road  
And its not like her to drive that slow, nothings on the radio  
Footsteps on the front porch, I hear my doorbell  
She usually comes right in, now I can tell  
  
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time  
Here comes the start of every sleepless night  
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things had never changed  
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye  
  
I can hear her say I love you like it was yesterday  
And I can see it written on her face that she had never felt this way  
One day I thought id see her with her daddy by her side  
And violins would play here comes the bride  
  
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time  
Here comes the start of every sleepless night  
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things had never changed  
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye  
  
Why does it have to go from good to gone?  
Before the lights turn on, yeah and you're left alone  
All alone, but here comes goodbye  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Here comes goodbye, here comes the last time  
Here comes the start of every sleepless night  
The first of every tear I'm gonna cry  
Here comes the pain, here comes me wishing things had never changed  
And she was right here in my arms tonight, but here comes goodbye

They got three in the front and four in the back of a civic  
Camped out all night on the sidewalk just to get tickets  
With their hands on the fence in the back by the buses and the limousines  
Just to get a glance at a drummer or singer yeah anything  
And they come from miles around  
For that moment when the lights go out  
And they scream  
  
It's the girls in the front row singin'  
It's the boys with the wheels that bring them  
Its lighters in the air and you guys up there  
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do  
Here's to you  
  
There's a silver tongued blonde trying to sweet talk her way back stage  
There's a mom and a dad in the aisle not acting their age  
There a wet Corvette red lipstick print a on Coors Light cup  
And judging by the way she's dancing I'd say she's had enough  
  
The guitars come alive  
And you make us wanna stay all night  
And they scream  
  
It's the girls in the front row singin'  
It's the boys with the wheels that bring them  
Its lighters in the air and you guys up there  
You're the heart and soul and the reason we do what we do  
Here's to you, here's to you

There's a Mountain Dew can with lipstick on it  
Rollin' round his truck bed.  
He just leaves it back there,  
One of the things he has left of her  
When he drives into the late day sun  
You can see a set of footprints.  
He ain't going to clean that windshield,  
He'd rather just live with the hurt.  
  
He's holdin' on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel.  
To the shifter, to the pictures.  
Every precious moment with her.  
Like the left behind colors in the sky  
When the sun is gone.  
He's holdin' on.  
Oh, he's holdin' on.  
  
There's that voice mail on his cell phone  
He don't dare erase.  
She ended with I love you,  
And he saves it just in case  
It might still be true.  
No he ain't through.  
  
He's holdin' on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel.  
To the shifter, to the pictures.  
Every precious moment with her.  
Like the left behind colors in the sky  
When the sun is gone.  
He's holdin' on.  
  
To the past  
To the last time he held her  
The breath on his neck.  
The three words she said.  
  
Oh, oh, oh,  
  
He's holdin' on to the wheel  
To the way she made him feel.  
To the shifter, to the pictures.  
Every precious moment with her.  
  
He's holdin' on  
Yeah, he's holdin' on  
He's holdin' on  
He's holdin on

There's three in the wall from those pictures in the closet  
Two in the bedroom from that night I lost it  
One deep inside me determined to stay  
They don't get any bigger but they don't go away  
  
Holes in and around me I keep falling back into  
Holes digging its around me  
God knows what I'm gonna do  
To fill in these holes left by you  
Left by you  
  
I pour drink after drink but nothing hit bottom  
I've been on my knees admitted my problem  
The love that we made still barely an echo  
I'll try anything in these vacant hollow  
  
Holes in and around me I keep falling back into  
Holes digging its around me  
God knows what I'm gonna do  
To fill in these holes left by you  
Left by you  
  
There's two through my hands and one through my feet  
From this cross that I bear until the day that I see

[Verse 1]  
When she told you goodbye you didn't flinch  
When she looked back you didn't even budge an inch  
You stood there like a stone but now that's she's gone  
  
[Chorus]  
How strong are you now without her around  
You can't even keep one little bitty tear from falling down  
Tell me how strong are you now  
  
[Verse 2]  
Before she left you told yourself it can't hurt that much  
Now your double over like you took a punch  
No she ain't coming back tell me how much can you take of that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
What's that rule that you live by, a tough guy never cries  
How strong are you now, without her around  
You can't even keep one little bitty ear from falling down  
Tell me how strong, tell me how strong are you now  
How strong are you now, oh, what's that rule you live by  
You say tough guys never cry how strong are you now

I don't wanna wait, it's been too long  
I don't wanna lay here all alone  
I don't wanna need this phone  
To hear you breathe  
  
Every second feels just like a year  
Every moment you're not here  
Is like a lifetime of lonely  
Please  
  
Hurry baby  
I need you coming through that door  
Hurry baby  
I can't be without you anymore  
Come and save me  
I'm losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me goin' crazy  
Hurry baby  
  
Every single car that passes by  
My heart beats faster everytime  
I pray it's your headlights coming home  
If I could just speed up that clock  
I'd get you here then make it stop  
I'd wrap you in my arms  
And love you real slow  
  
Hurry baby  
I need you coming through that door  
Hurry baby  
I can't be without you anymore  
Come and save me  
I'm losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me goin' crazy  
Hurry baby  
  
Hurry baby  
Hurry baby  
Come and save me  
I'm losing it  
I swear that this  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me goin' crazy  
Hurry baby  
I can't be without you anymore  
Hurry baby, hurry baby  
Hurry baby  
Not kissin' you, missin' you is got me  
Is got me goin' crazy

I should be out in that driveway stopping you  
Tears should me rolling down my cheek  
And I don't know why I'm not falling apart like I usually do  
And how the thought of losing you is not killin' me  
I feel bad...  
  
That I can stand here strong  
Cold as stone  
Seems so wrong  
I can't explain it  
Maybe it's just  
I've cried so much  
I'm tired, and I'm numb  
Baby, I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I don't feel bad  
  
I could let myself be angry over wasted time  
Sad about just throwing love away  
Yeah, I almost wish my heart was breakin'  
But I can't lie  
All I want to do is turn the page  
I feel bad...  
  
That I can stand here strong  
Cold as stone  
Seems so wrong  
I can't explain it  
Maybe it's just  
I've cried so much  
I'm tired, and I'm numb  
Baby, I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I don't feel bitter, alone  
(It's time to...) I just feel it's time  
It's time to move on  
I just got to move on, and on, and on, and on  
  
Yeah  
  
Maybe it's just  
I've cried so much  
I'm tired, and I'm numb  
Oh baby, I hate it  
I feel bad  
That I don't feel bad  
No, I don't feel bad

I come from California  
Where you say no one grows old  
And y'all drive to fast.  
But you say it so slow.  
In that southern style, baby  
That always drives me crazy.  
And I start to laugh.  
  
Cause, I have never been to Memphis  
But if you're there  
I will pack my bag, and go.  
Cause I don't care, if it never rains here,  
The suns always shining.  
I have never met a girl like you  
And I'm tired of trying.  
I have never been to Memphis.  
  
You're all crazy about Jesus  
Back where you're from.  
You got baptized in rivers  
Where the deep waters run.  
That's alright by me,  
Yeah I love that you believe in  
Something you can't touch,  
Something you can't see.  
  
Cause, I have never been to Memphis  
But if you're there  
I will pack my bag, and go.  
Even though, never been afraid of flying  
But I am afraid to fall.  
I've been painting by numbers you've been  
Just splashing them on the wall.  
And I see the colors running  
It lets me know which way to go.  
  
After all  
(After all)  
Yeah, After all  
(After all)  
I've got to get myself there, oh yeah  
You know I've got to get myself there  
  
Cause I have never been to Memphis  
But if you're there.  
I'm on my way  
(Oh, oh oh oh)  
I'm on my way  
I'm on my way  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
I'm on my way  
Yeah  
I'm on my way.  
Gotta get myself to you baby, yeah  
  
I have never been to Memphis.  
But if you're there  
I have never been to Memphis.  
  
You're all crazy about Jesus  
Back where you're from,  
You get baptized in rivers  
Where the deep waters run.

I love hearing that shower turn on  
Bet there's nothin' but a towel on you  
You sing along with some Timberlake bumpin'  
But he ain't got nothin' on you  
I don't wanna hear the coffee pouring  
A goodbye kiss, then lockin' the door yeah  
Sounds like leavin' you, oh  
  
It's a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
It's way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over, come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
'Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
  
Love the sound of the thunder rollin'  
Makes you move a little closer to me  
Girl I bet that your neighbors hate us  
'Cause we could laugh all night and never sleep  
We can worry 'bout the world in the mornin'  
Light up a candle, lock the door  
Wanna stay right here with you, yes I do  
  
It's a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
It's way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over, come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
'Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
  
Turn your radio on, baby turn down the lights  
I'm ain't goin' nowhere, I'm all yours tonight  
  
It's a little too loud on the highway  
I wanna pull back in your driveway  
It's way too quiet at my place  
Wanna come on over, come on over  
I just wanna hear that ringtone  
I like it turned up when you're blowin' up my phone  
Wanna hear you say come on over  
'Cause when you tell me to come on over  
I like the sound of that  
  
Mmm mmm mmm

Mmm mmm mmm

Mmm mmm mmm  
I like the sound, I like the sound of that  
Yes I do  
I like the sound of that  
Oh

When you light those candles  
Up there on that mantle  
Setting the mood  
I just lie there staring, silently preparing  
To love on you  
I can feel the heat from across the room  
Ain't it wild what a little flame can make you wanna do  
  
I melt  
Every time you look at me that way  
It never fails  
Any time, any place  
This burn in me is the coolest thing that I've ever felt  
I melt  
  
Don't know how you do it  
I love the way I lose it every time  
And what's even better  
Is knowing that forever you're all mine  
The closer you get, the more my body aches  
One little stare from you is all it takes  
  
I melt  
Every time you look at me that way  
It never fails  
Any time, any place  
This burn in me is the coolest thing that I've ever felt  
I melt  
  
I melt  
Every time you look at me that way  
It never fails  
Any time, any place  
This burn in me is the coolest thing that I've ever felt  
I melt  
  
Every time you look at me that way  
I melt  
I melt

Well I guess its in my genes  
Not in horoscopes or cosmic things  
These feelings run in my blood  
Always was and always is  
Comes on strong and it never quiets  
Never had to work that hard at love  
It ain't magic, know it's automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didn't even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
What everybody else calls a mystery  
Sure comes easy to me  
Yeah you might say I'm natural  
Well its got nothing to do with me  
It's all about you and the way you set me free  
To be the man who has it all  
It ain't magic, know it's automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didn't even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born to love (love), give (give)  
Share everything that I'm feeling only with you  
It ain't magic, know it's automatic  
You walk in a room  
Girl I gotta have it  
Cupid didn't even have to let an arrow go  
There was no love potion  
No walking on the ocean  
No miracle hat to break through  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
If you wonder why I love you like I do  
Baby I was born too  
Oh

It's like a storm  
That cuts a path  
It's breaks your will  
It feels like that  
  
You think you're lost  
But your not lost on your own  
You're not alone  
  
I will stand by you  
I will help you through  
When you've done all you can do  
If you can't cope  
I will dry your eyes  
I will fight your fight  
I will hold you tight  
And I won't let go  
  
It hurts my heart  
To see you cry  
I know it's dark  
This part of life  
Oh it finds us all (finds us all)  
And we're too small  
To stop the rain  
Oh but when it rains  
  
I will stand by you  
I will help you through  
When you've done all you can do  
And you can't cope  
I will dry your eyes  
I will fight your fight  
I will hold you tight  
And I won't let you fall  
  
Don't be afraid to fall  
I'm right here to catch you  
I won't let you down  
It won't get you down  
You're gonna make it  
Yeah I know you can make it  
  
'Cause I will stand by you  
I will help you through  
When you've done all you can do  
And you can't cope  
And I will dry your eyes  
I will fight your fight  
I will hold you tight  
And I won't let go  
Oh I'm gonna hold you  
And I won't let go  
Won't let you go  
No I won't

Well you know those times  
When you feel like there's a sign there on your back  
Say's I don't mind if ya kick me  
Seems like everybody has  
Things go from bad to worse  
You'd think they can't get worse than that  
And then they do  
  
You step off the straight and narrow  
And you don't know where you are  
Use the needle of your compass  
To sew up your broken heart  
Ask directions from a genie  
In a bottle of Jim Beam  
And she lies to You  
That's when you learn the truth  
  
If you're going through hell  
Keep on going, Don't slow down  
If you're scared, don't show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
Well I been deep down in that darkness  
I been down to my last match  
Felt a hundred different demons  
Breathing fire in my back  
And I knew that if I stumbled  
I'd fall right into the trap that they were laying, Yeah  
  
But the good news  
Is there's angels everywhere out on the street  
Holding out a hand to pull you back upon your feet  
The one's that you been dragging for so long  
You're on your knees  
You might as well be praying  
Guess what I'm saying  
If you're going through hell  
Keep on going, Don't slow down  
If you're scared, don't show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
Yeah, If you're going through hell  
Keep on moving, Face that fire  
Walk right through it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
If you're going through hell  
Keep on going, Don't slow down  
If you're scared, don't show it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
  
Yeah, If you're going through hell  
Keep on moving, Face that fire  
Walk right through it  
You might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
Yeah you might get out  
Before the devil even knows you're there  
Yeah.

I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents 'neath the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
And you'll be in my dreams  
  
I'll be home this Christmas, darling  
I'll be coming home to you  
And there's nothing in the world  
Gonna get in my way  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can plan on me  
Please have snow  
And mistletoe  
And presents 'neath the tree  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
And you'll be in my dreams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
Till then you'll be in my dreams

I've dealt with my ghosts  
And I've faced all my demons  
Finally content with the past I regret  
I've found you find strength in your moments of weakness  
For once, I'm at peace with myself  
I've been burdened with blame  
Trapped in the past for too long  
I'm moving on  
  
I've lived in this place  
And I know all the faces  
Each one is different  
But they're always the same  
They mean me no harm  
But it's time that I face it  
They'll never allow me to change  
But I never dreamed home would end up where I don't belong  
I'm moving on  
  
I'm moving on  
At last I can see  
(Last I can see)  
Life has been patiently waiting for me  
And I know there's no guarentees  
But I'm not alone  
There comes a time in everyone's life  
When all you can see are the years passing by  
(The years passing by)  
And I have made up my mind  
That those days are gone  
  
I sold what I could  
And packed what I couldn't  
Stopped to fill up on my way out of town  
I've loved like I should  
But lived like I shouldn't  
I had to lose everything to find out  
Maybe forgiveness will find me somewhere down this road  
I'm moving on  
I'm moving on  
I'm moving on

Tell me you've had trouble sleeping  
That you toss and turn from side to side  
That it's my face you've been seeing  
In your dreams at night  
  
Tell me that you wake up crying  
And you're not sure exactly why  
Tell me that something is missing  
In your life, in your life baby  
  
Tell me that you live for love  
That forever is never enough  
That you've waited all your life to see  
That you want so badly to believe  
Tell me that it's not just me  
  
I could have sworn I saw you smile at me  
Standing in the pouring rain  
At a loss for words and running out of time  
I said this crazy ting (crazy thing), I said  
  
Tell me that you live for love  
That forever is never enough  
That you've waited all your life to see  
That you want so badly to believe  
Tell me that it's not just me  
  
Hold me now and tell me that you do believe  
In a soul, a soul mate  
And tell me, and tell me, tell me  
  
Tell me that you live for love  
That forever is never enough  
That you've waited all your life to see  
That you want so badly to believe  
Tell me that it's not just me

Tommy found his daddy's gun  
And Joey had never seen one  
Real cowboy all dressed up  
As he held it in his hand  
Said, "You be good and I'll be bad"  
Then he pulled the trigger back  
Stopped little Tommy in his tracks  
And said, "Get up, man"  
People came from miles to say goodbye  
To the Wilson's youngest son  
His innocent life had just begun  
  
[Chorus]  
It's not supposed to go like that  
It's not intended to end that way  
Life is a journey constantly turning  
Down an unknown path  
But it's not supposed to go like that  
  
Jimmy had his daddy's car  
And the keys to Jenny's heart  
A fifth of whiskey on the floorboard  
Almost gone  
Havin' the time of their life  
Had only one thing on their mind  
Never saw the flashin' lights  
Or the train comin' on  
Now there's a wreath and two small crosses  
On the right side of the road  
Reminders of a love that won't grow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I wonder if guardian angels cry  
When they see it all played out  
And as they stand with their hands tied  
Oh, do they cry out loud  
  
It's not suppose to go like that  
No, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, it's not supposed, it's not supposed to go like that  
No, no, no, it's not supposed to go like that

Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing and jingle bells ring  
Snowing and blowing and pushing of fun  
Now the jingle hop has began  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell, jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell time and jingle bell time  
Dancing and prancing and jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
  
Jingle bell time it's a swell time  
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh  
Gidding up jingle horse, pick up your feet  
Jingle all around the clock  
Mix and mingle and a jingle and beats  
That's the jingle bell rock  
  
What a bright time, it's the right time  
To rock the night away  
  
Jingle bell time it's a swell time  
To go gliding in a one-horse sleigh  
Gidding up jingle horse, pick up those feet  
Jingle all around the clock  
Mix and mingle and a jingle and beats  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell  
That's the jingle bell rock

Lean on me when you're not strong  
And I'll be your friend (I'll be your Friend)  
I'll help you carry on  
For it won't be long till I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on  
  
I said For it won't be long till I'm gonna need  
Somebody to lean on

Seven forty two in the morning  
Eight seconds before it all sinks in  
Put your best face on for the world  
Fake another smile and just pretend  
But you're just puttin' off the pain  
Nothing's ever really gonna change  
  
So let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Let it burn to the worst degree  
May not be what you want, but it's what you need  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
And let it hurt  
Yeah, let it hurt  
  
Three twenty eight in the morning  
Countin' up the spaces between the rain  
You're gettin' used to the rocks at the bottom  
Your heart goes numb, but the lonely stays the same  
And that's the price you're bound to pay  
And there's really nothing anyone can say  
Oh, there's only just one way  
  
So let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Let it burn to the worst degree  
May not be what you want, but it's what you need  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
So go on  
Yeah, let it hurt  
  
You might just find you're better for it  
When you let go and you learn  
To let it hurt, let it bleed  
Let it take you right down to your knees  
Oh  
Sometimes the only way around it  
Is to let love do it's work  
So go on  
And let it hurt  
Oh, let it hurt  
  
Seven forty two in the morning  
Eight seconds before it all sinks in

Whooo umm yeah  
Life's like a road that you travel on  
When there's one day here and the next day gone  
Sometimes you bend and sometimes you stand  
Sometimes you turn your back to the wind  
There's a world outside every darkened door  
Where blues won't haunt you anymore  
Where brave are free and lovers soar  
Come ride with me to the distant shore  
We won't hesitate  
To break down the garden gate  
There's not much time left today  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Life is a highway  
I wanna ride it all night long  
If you're going my way  
I wanna drive it all night long  
Gimme gimme gimme gimme yeah  
  
Through all these cities and all these towns  
It's in my blood and it's all around  
I love you now like I loved you then  
This is the road and these are the hands  
From Mozambique to those Memphis nights  
The Khyber Pass to Vancouver's lights  
Knock me down and back up again  
You're in my blood I'm not a lonely man  
There's no load I can't hold  
A road so rough this I know  
I'll be there when the light comes in  
Tell 'em we're survivors  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
There was a distance between you and I  
A misunderstanding once  
But now we look in the eye  
  
There ain't no load that I can't hold  
A road so rough this I know  
I'll be there when the light comes in  
Tell 'em we're survivors  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x3]

Lying here with you  
I watch you while you sleep  
The dawn is closing in  
With every breath you breathe  
  
I can feel the change  
The change you've made in me  
But will I ever see  
All the things you see in me  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When it comes to love  
I may not know the rules  
But there's one thing I know  
My heart belongs to you, just you  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
You show me you love me  
With a fire that burns deep inside  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
When you say that I'm one of a kind  
Baby, I don't see it but you believe  
That I'm so strong and true, I promise you  
I'll try to be that kind of man  
Because you love me like I am  
  
I am  
I'll never understand  
I don't think I'll ever understand  
Why you love me  
Why you love me just like I am

Sounds like a scene from the silver screen  
Yeah, that's how it was  
Love doens't always look like a picture perfect storybook  
Ah, but sometimes it does  
  
Standing beside her the stars shined even brighter  
And for a moment all the world was, all the world was still  
I knew we belonged together the moment my eyes met hers  
And I thought nothing last forever, but maybe this one will  
  
A deep breath and baby steps  
that's how the whole thing starts  
It's a long slow beautiful dance  
To the beat of a heart  
  
The world starts to spin again, you learn things you didn't know then  
Feels like the bloom is off the rose  
But you weather a few storms and you pull out a few thorns  
And together the garden grows and grows  
  
A deep breath and baby steps  
that's how the whole thing starts  
It's a long slow beautiful dance  
To the beat of a heart  
  
It's a long slow beautiful dance  
  
The house is filled with so much love  
We got more than enough for two  
So we've been thinking about having a baby  
I know it sounds crazy, but it seems like the natural thing to do  
  
A deep breath and baby steps  
that's how the whole thing starts  
It's a long slow beautiful dance  
To the beat of a heart  
  
It's a long slow  
It's a long slow  
It's a long slow

It' s 3 A. M. And you' re still wide awake  
Wonderin' how much more your broken heart can take  
All he left you with is shattered dreams  
I know it' s hard to see right now it' s not as bad as it seems  
  
You' ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it' s way  
Hold on, it won' t be long  
I know the pain you' re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It' s ok, don' t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
I know you said you lost your faith in love  
But it' s not written in the stars above  
I wouldn' t tell you anything but the truth  
Cause I' ve been where you are and I' m living proof  
  
You' ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it' s way  
Hold on, it won' t be long  
I know the pain you' re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It' s ok, don' t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
What' s here right now didn' t come to stay  
The sun' s gonna rise again and the clouds will roll away  
Believe me when I say  
  
You' ll live to love another day  
Happiness is on it' s way  
Hold on, hold on  
I know the pain you' re living in  
Sometimes you gotta lose to win  
It' s ok, don' t you worry baby  
We all live to love another day  
  
Don' t you worry baby cause we all live to love another day

I should have stolen every moment  
Now there's a page with not enough on it  
Where we belong  
I guess I'll never understand it  
Why do we take it all for granted  
Until it's gone  
'Cause then it's gone  
  
Love who you love  
With all that you have  
And don't waste the time that flies so fast  
Love who you love  
And say that you do  
Hold on as tight as they'll let you  
Love who you love  
  
Give all ya' got like its your last day  
Your heart and soul before it's too late  
And pull 'em in  
So close enough that they can feel it  
With every single breath that you're breathin'  
Breathe it in again and again  
  
[Chorus]  
Love who you love  
With all that you have  
And don't waste the time that flies so fast  
Love who you love  
And say that you do  
Hold on as tight as they'll let you  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Love who you love  
Say that you do  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Love who you love)  
Love who you love  
(Love who you love)  
  
Hold on, keep on holding on  
Yeah, with every single breath you're breathing  
  
Love who you love  
Love who you love  
Again and again and again and again.

Now there are days when I don't have a clue where to find me  
My shadow feels like a stranger lagging behind me  
I feel like a king of I can't get a break, bad timing  
But the reason, the questions and my second guessing  
Don't hang around to long  
  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
I can step right into the great unknown  
And always find my way back home  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
  
It's so crazy no matter how much you pour in  
You seem to find a way to fit a little bit more in  
You smile that smile and it feels like a brand new morning  
You're bound and determine and I don't deserve it  
But God knows where I'd be  
  
If you didn't keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
I can step right into the great unknown  
And always find my way back home  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
  
Life can take you, turn you, twist you right in two,  
Oh bring it on  
I've got you  
  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby  
(You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby)  
(You keep lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me, lovin' me baby)  
I can step right into the great unknown  
And always find my way back home  
You keep lovin' me  
You keep lovin' me  
You keep lovin' me  
Oh baby

Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would one day walk on water?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Would save our sons and daughters?  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has come to make you new?  
This child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you.  
  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will give sight to a blind man?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will calm a storm with His hand?  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Has walked where angels trod?  
And when you've kissed your little baby  
Then you've kissed the face of God.  
Oh Mary did you know?  
  
Mary did you know?  
The blind will see the deaf will hear  
The dead will live a-gain  
The lame will leap the dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb.  
  
Oh Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Is Lord of all creation?  
Mary did you know that your baby boy  
Will one day rule the nations?  
  
Did you know that your baby boy  
Is heaven's perfect Lamb?  
And the sleeping child you're holding  
Is the great I am.  
Oh Mary

Sometimes it feels like this world is spinning faster  
Than it did in the old days  
So naturally, we have more natural disasters  
From the strain of a fast pace  
Sunday was a day of rest  
Now, it's one more day for progress  
And we can't slow down ?cause more is best  
It's all an endless process  
  
[Chorus]  
(Well) I miss Mayberry  
Sitting on the porch drinking ice-cold cherry Coke  
Where everything is black and white  
Picking on a six string  
Where people pass by and you call them by their first name  
Watching the clouds roll by  
Bye, bye  
  
Sometimes I can hear this old earth shouting  
Through the trees as the wind blows  
That's when I climb up here on this mountain  
To look through God's window  
Now I can't fly  
But I got two feet that get me high up here  
Above the noise and city streets  
My worries disappear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I dream I'm driving down an old dirt road  
Not even listed on a map  
I pass a dad and son carrying a fishing pole  
But I always wake up every time I try to turn back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bye, bye  
(I miss Mayberry, I miss Mayberry)

Way on down to Southern Alabama  
With the guitars jamming  
That's where we're headed  
Straight up to Butte, Montana  
  
Singin' "Lord, I was born a ramblin' man"  
California to Oregon  
Even New York City  
Got one or two hillbillies  
Ready to hit the road  
  
It's a brother and a sister kind of thing  
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang with  
Me and my gang  
We live to ride, we ride to live  
  
Me and my gang  
Jump on that train  
Grab hold of them reins  
We're gonna rock this thing  
  
Cock this thing  
Me and my gang, yeah  
Yeah, me and my gang  
  
We got hippies, gypsies, freaks and geeks  
High class women in daisy duke denim  
Bangin' on gongs and singing our songs  
Dude named Elrock jammin' on an I-Pod  
  
Beer and bonfires  
Wide open throttle, Coors in a bottle  
It's all for one and one for all, y'all  
  
It's a brother and a sister kind of thing  
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang with  
Me and my gang  
We live to ride, we ride to live  
Me and my gang  
  
Jump on that train  
Grab hold of them reins  
We're gonna rock this thing  
Cock this thing  
Me and my gang, yeah, woo!  
  
It's a brother and a sister kind of thing  
Raise up your hands if you all wanna hang  
With me and my gang  
We live to ride, we ride to live  
  
Me and my gang  
Jump on that train  
Grab hold of them reins  
We're gonna rock this thing  
  
Cock this thing  
Yeah  
  
Yeah, me and my gang  
Jump on that train  
Woo!  
Grab hold of them reins, baby

I hope the days come easy and the moments pass slow,  
And each road leads you where you wanna go,  
And if you're faced with a choice, and you have to choose,  
I hope you choose the one that means the most to you.  
And if one door opens to another door closed,  
I hope you keep on walkin' till you find the window,  
If it's cold outside, show the world the warmth of your smile.  
But more than anything, more than anything  
  
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to,  
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small,  
You never need to carry more than you can hold,  
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,  
I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too,  
Yeah, this, is my wish.  
  
I hope you never look back, but you never forget,  
All the ones who love you, in the place you live,  
I hope you always forgive, and you never regret,  
And you help somebody every chance you get,  
Oh, you find God's grace, in every mistake,  
And always give more than you take.  
But more than anything, yeah, more than anything  
  
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to,  
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small,  
You never need to carry more than you can hold,  
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,  
I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too,  
Yeah, this, is my wish. Yeah, yeah.  
  
My wish, for you, is that this life becomes all that you want it to,  
Your dreams stay big, your worries stay small,  
You never need to carry more than you can hold,  
And while you're out there getting where you're getting to,  
I hope you know somebody loves you, and wants the same things too,  
Yeah, this, is my wish (my wish, for you).  
  
This is my wish (my wish, for you)  
I hope you know somebody loves you (my wish, for you).  
May all your dreams stay big (my wish, for you)

Last night you gave me a kiss  
You didn't know it, but I was awake when you did  
You were quiet, you were gonna let me sleep  
So I just laid there pretending to be  
  
You said some things you didn't  
Know I could hear  
And the words "I love you" never  
Sounded so sincere  
  
It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving  
Now that I know just how much you care  
You finally gave me one good reason not to go  
But staying here is my worst fear  
  
This morning I rolled out of bed  
Recalling all the sweet things you said  
This was the day I was gonna hurt you bad  
Called out your name, but you  
Didn't answer back  
I searched the house to find out what was wrong  
Like a ton of bricks, it hit me you were gone  
  
It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving  
Now that I know just how much you care  
You finally gave me one good reason not to go  
But staying here is my worst fear  
  
All along I knew that there was  
Something missing  
And only one thing left to do  
I had to leave behind this life that  
We'd been living  
But the only thing that left was you  
  
It's gonna make it hard to tell you that I'm leaving  
Now that I know just how much you care  
You finally gave me one good reason not to go  
But being alone is my worst fear  
And staying here is my worst fear

Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
Baby, next to you, next to me  
  
Ridin' down the road in my pick-up truck  
Ya' better be ready 'cause I'm pickin' you up  
With a full moon shinin' and a little bit a' luck  
We'll run outta gas and maybe get stuck  
  
We can get lost, baby, I don't care  
I ain't worried as long as you're there  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
Barbecue chicken in aluminum foil  
Just enough money for my gas and oil  
Who needs your shrimp and your caviar?  
I'd sooner have you just the way you are  
  
Rich people got their money to hold  
Mansion on the hill with diamonds and gold  
Can't compare as far as I can see  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
Radio playin' our favorite song  
Well, I'll change the station if the news comes on  
The signal ain't comin' in too strong  
Make our own music, honey, all night long  
  
If the Good Lord's willin' when we're old and gray  
The kids are grown up and moved away  
We'll be rockin' there side by side  
With a barbeque chicken and the TV guide  
  
Well, there ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
Ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
Next to you, next to me  
As long as you're next to me, baby  
  
Next to you, oh sittin' next to me  
I'd sooner have you just the way you are  
Aw, there ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me  
  
And if the Good Lord's willin' when we're old and gray  
The kids are grown up and moved away  
We'll be rockin' there side by side  
With a barbecue chicken and the TV guide  
Oh, yeah  
There ain't no place that I'd rather be  
Next to you sittin' next to me

She left that loser in a dust cloud  
Heart in his hand, chin on the ground  
Cried her last tear for that clown  
She can see a little clearer now  
She said, "Oh, oh, I gotta go and find me"  
Oh, oh she found the strength to break free  
  
[Chorus:]  
Like a painted wild mustang  
Flyin' out across the open range  
Finally gets to live her life that way  
No fear, no fences, nobody-no reins  
  
No reins  
  
All she's ever felt is held back  
She says, "It's kinda nice to hear myself laugh"  
She's gonna do a lot more of that  
She's makin' plans and makin' tracks  
She said, "Oh, oh I gotta go and find me"  
Oh, oh she found the strength to break free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh she's learnin' how to let go  
Oh, oh whichever way the wind blows  
Oh, oh she's learnin' how to let go  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
No reins

There's nothing in my life I'd say I regret  
But there's something in your eyes that makes me forget  
The times that I believed that love was good as love could be  
I had it all but I was wrong  
  
Thought I'd been touched  
Thought I'd been kissed  
Thought I'd been loved  
But it was nothing like this  
  
You can't describe the sea unless you've been there before  
It's just a mystery until you're standing on the shore  
And moved by every wave  
Taking your breath away  
Like you do to me  
  
Thought I'd been touched  
Thought I'd been kissed  
Thought I'd been loved  
But it was nothing, nothing like this  
  
It's like another life  
Like I hadn't felt a thing  
Until you  
  
Thought I'd been touched  
Thought I'd been kissed  
Thought I'd been loved  
But it was nothing, nothing like this  
It was nothing like this  
Nothing like, nothing like this

Should of been much further than this by now  
A little bit more gone a little less twisted around  
Should of been much better you'd think but I'm not,  
I'm still stuck, I'm still here, in this rut  
  
Looking back on everything that we had  
Holding on to words that we can't take back  
What am I to do with the past, when it's all that I have,  
And I can't get you back  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go, I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been, all we've done, and all the love that we shared  
Once, oh, once  
  
I remember you sayin' I was the one,  
And nothing could change that but you were wrong  
It's funny how life turns on a dime now we don't even talk  
I just stare at these walls  
  
And I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been all we've done and all the love that we shared  
Once, you made the world feel so right  
Once, you were my morning noon and night  
Why'd we slip away, why did it all change,  
How will I ever be the same  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go, I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been, all we've done, and all the love that we shared  
  
Now I wait by the phone in the dark drunk on hope  
I'm so lost, I'm so low, and I just want you to know  
Everywhere that I go, I'm reminded of us  
Where we've been, all we've done, and all the love that we shared  
  
Should of been much further then this by now  
A little bit more gone a little less twisted around

One good love  
Erases all the bitter tears on an empty dance hall  
All those lonely nights when she never called  
It just don't seem so tragic after all  
With one good love  
  
One good love  
And daddy's hands were strong and fair  
And momma understands because she's been there  
And all mistakes were just because they cared so much  
With one good love  
  
One good love  
You bless all my memories  
You soften the fall of my tears  
And in my arms you're more than enough  
You're one good love  
  
Hey, you're one good love  
Yeah, you're one good love  
  
One good love  
You bless all my memories  
You soften the fall of my tears  
And in my arms you're more than enough  
You're one good love  
  
One good love  
And born again means more than pass the plate and bow your head  
Yes, you bury what needs burying, you raise it from the dead  
The very best, you heal the brokenness, give grace to everyone  
With one good love  
  
Yeah, oh, one good love  
Hey, hey, one good love  
Yeah, I'll give you one good love  
Oooo, oooo, oooo, ooooo, oooo, yeah  
Lord, I feel born again, yeah  
You got to give me one good love now  
One good love

Ooooh yeah, ohhhh, uh  
  
Well it's a simple thing  
A look, a laugh, a clover ring  
And all those little scenes, dreams are made of  
And it's evident that when my hopes and prayers are spent  
Well there she came and there I went  
  
Ohhh, someone makes it mistifying  
Baby, there's just no denying that every time we touch  
Heavenly it's so divine, but you know what just blows my mind  
Is the miracle of love, just an ordinary love  
Just and ordinary love  
  
It's just another day  
I kiss goodbye and I'm on my way  
Rushin through the maze right back to your arms  
And it's difficult, just a boy and just a girl  
Out on screen and around the world  
  
Ohhh, someone makes it mistifying  
Baby, there's just no denyingevery time we touch  
Heavenly it's so divine, but you know what just blows my mind  
Is the miracle of love, just an ordinary love  
Just and ordinary love, yeah, ohhh yeah  
  
Ooooh, someone makes it mistifying  
Baby, there's just no denying every time we touch  
Heavenly it's so divine, but you know what just blows my mind  
It's the miracle of love, just an ordinary love  
Just an ordinary love

Front of the line, straight past the bouncer  
Lookin' so fine that the band announced ya'  
Gotcha tight jeans on and your hair done right  
All your girlfriends say we throwin' down tonight  
Let me guess, somebody done you wrong  
And you're lookin' for a way to get your feel-good on  
Get some pictures on the Instagram and show him what he's missin'  
Straight no chaser, girl on a mission  
  
Mmm, baby, I could be your payback  
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back  
Take ya' to the dance floor I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Yeah, I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Gonna have a real good time  
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine  
We can show him what he can't have  
If you wanna play that game  
Yeah, baby, I can be your payback  
  
I bet he's sitting at home all alone in the dark  
Probably texting like mad, wants to know where you are  
'Cause he didn't even know what he had 'til he lost it  
Should have known runnin' around was gonna cost him  
No way that girl is as pretty as you  
I never even seen her but I know that it's true  
If he was even half a man he wouldn't have blown it  
Thinkin' 'bout it that way feels good, don't it?  
  
Mmm, baby, I could be your payback  
Hey, gonna help you get your sway back  
Take ya' to the dance floor I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Yeah, I'm-a lean ya' way back  
Gonna have a real good time  
Don't worry 'bout your tab, girl, put it on mine  
We can show him what he can't have  
If you wanna play that game  
Yeah, baby, I can be your payback

You're a single mom with three kids and just as many jobs  
Your candle burns at both ends but you can't make it stop  
Your a farmer on a John Deer honest work for little pay  
Now throw that thing in park it's time to play  
  
[Chorus]  
Like it's midnight in Vegas  
Mardi Gras in New Orleans  
New Years Eve in New York City  
You know what I mean  
It's like lovers in Paris, Sunset Strip in L.A.  
Doesn't matter where you are  
Well it's alright it's alright to play  
  
Oh yes it is  
  
Where there ain't no drugs or doctors  
Who can get you what you need  
I've got the magic potion  
And it doesn't cost a thing  
Yeah you've seen some hard times  
Life just works out that way  
When your smack dab in the middle  
You gotta play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey hey  
  
Like a kiss in the moonlight  
Barefoot walks on the beach  
Like sipping Champagne straight from a bottle  
You know what I mean  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(It's alright to play it's alright it's alright it's alright to play yeah it's
alright)  
Come on come on come on  
It's alright to play (it's alright to play it's alright it's alright it's
alright to play)  
It's alright to play yeah (it's alright to play it's alright it's alright it's
alright to play)  
Yeah it's alright to play (it's alright to play yeah it's alright it's alright
to play)  
Well it's alright it's alright well it's alright alright to play  
It's alright to play

Oh oh oh oh ooh  
I saw a red Camaro today  
It turned my head around it made me think  
About back when my life was a game  
And we played it all night long just like  
Our favorite song. Summers just around the bend  
Summers just around the bend.  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
I saw a red Camaro today  
And I did a double take  
I thought I saw her face  
We were so reckless and young  
And it all comes back to me  
In storm wash memories  
Summers just around the bend  
Summers just around the bend  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
Looking back looking back  
Sweet wine and sunshine  
Looking back looking back  
Man those were some good times  
Oh oh oh oh  
Everybody sing  
Oh oh oh  
1, 2, 3, 4  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Take the T top down  
And let the chrome shine  
Cruise along the river side  
Feel the wind blow  
Through your hair through your toes  
Got your bare feet hanging out the window  
Oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh  
  
Turn up the music loud  
Turn up the music loud

You say you want a revolution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the world  
You tell me that it's evolution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change the world  
But when you talk about destruction  
Don't you know that you can count me out  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
All right, all right  
  
You say you got a real solution  
Well, you know  
We'd all love to see the plan  
You ask me for a contribution  
Well, you know  
We're doing what we can  
But if you want money  
For people with minds that hate  
  
All I can tell is brother you have to wait  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
All right, all right  
Ah  
  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah...  
  
You say you'll change the constitution  
Well, you know  
We all want to change your head  
You tell me it's the institution  
Well, you know  
You better free you mind instead  
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao  
You ain't going to make it with anyone anyhow  
Don't you know it's gonna be all right  
All right, all right  
All right, all right, all right  
All right, all right, all right

Wish I could reach up and reset that sun  
Reverse these wheels go back and re-pick you up  
Went by so fast oh so sweet  
Make me wanna remake a memory  
Wish I had me a time machine  
  
Oh I float the moon back up in the sky  
Put a cork back into that sweet red wine  
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time  
Untouch your skin  
Unkiss your lips and kiss 'em again  
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind  
  
I turn back that radio dial reopen your door,  
Try to talk George Strait into giving us an encore  
Re-spin you around replay that sound of you laughing when we hit the ground,  
I can see it now how bout we  
  
Float the moon back up in the sky, put a cork back into that sweet red wine  
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time  
Untouch your skin  
Unkiss your lips and kiss em again  
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind  
  
I wanna re-fall and re- fly  
Baby re-live this night  
  
Float the moon back up in the sky, put a cork back into that sweet red wine  
Put your midnight hair back up so you can let it fall one more time  
Untouch your skin  
Unkiss your lips and kiss em again  
So good so right this is one night I'm wishing I could rewind

Whoa! Hey, hey  
Oh what a ride  
What a perfect sky to frame  
Your hazel eyes  
I'd scream on the inside  
But right now it feels like I've  
Been tranquilized  
Oh, what a fool am I  
To be tongue-tied  
Sitting next to her  
The princess and the passenger  
  
You touch the rain and suddenly  
There's waterfalls  
Now every day is something more  
Worth fighting for  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Baby, you make the sun shine down  
You make the sun shine down  
You can paint the darkest clouds  
And turn them into rainbows  
You take your secret smile  
The one that turns me on  
Hey girl, you've been what I've waited for  
  
Feet back on the pavement to the  
Basement  
On the bright side of the road  
Fumbling my lines to a lazy cat  
On the step outside her door  
She opens up  
And I'm in the Polaroid  
Standing next to her  
The princess and the passenger  
  
Touching the rain and suddenly  
There's waterfalls  
Now every day is something more  
Worth living for  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
On a day like this when the world  
Is elevated  
On a day like this when I know just  
Why I waited  
On a day like this when the world  
Is elevated  
On a day like this when I know just  
Why I waited

Ah, yeah  
Ah, yeah, yeah  
  
Before we met I was free  
I never had to worry about anyone but me  
Now that boy is gone and in his place  
Is a man who needs to hold you night and day  
So if I stumble, if I fall  
Forgive me, I'm just learning as I go along  
  
See me through, see me through  
This aching heart has come so far  
To be with you, see me through  
With angel eyes, just look inside  
At all this love I never want to lose  
See me through  
  
I know sometime I let you down  
But I'm still getting used to having you around  
And if I ever make you cry  
There's nothing I won't do to make things right  
I'm not perfect and that's for sure  
A little time is all I'm asking for  
  
See me through, see me through  
This aching heart has come so far  
To be with you, see me through  
With angel eyes, just look inside  
At all this love I never want to lose  
See me through  
  
See me through this mask I wear  
Well, I'm almost there, you know I care  
I am the man you always thought you knew  
  
See me through, see me through  
This aching heart has come so far  
To be with you, see me through  
With angel eyes, just look inside  
At all this love I never want to lose  
See me through  
  
See me through, yeah see me through  
Oh, see me through  
Yeah, yeah -  
Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, see me through  
Oh, we're almost there, can't you see that  
I'm almost, girl I'm almost there  
This mask I wear  
Girl, I'm almost there, I'm almost there  
See me, see me through this mask I wear  
I'm almost there  
Oooo, Oooo, Oooo, girl  
See me through, girl

No limits, no lines are drawn  
The whole world disappears when  
We're alone  
That thin white cotton dress is  
Blowin' in the wind  
She takes my hand and the dance begins  
  
[Chorus]  
With every move she makes  
I'm deeper than I've been  
Holding on and letting go  
She just keeps givin' in  
Takin' me higher and further  
There she goes again givin' more than  
She takes  
'Cause it's more than love she makes  
She goes all the way  
  
No questions, no talking at all  
Only the sound of our hearts as the fall  
No matter what I need, her answer's  
Always yes  
I only have to dream and she does the  
Rest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Oh, oh, oh  
My baby goes all the way, the way  
She goes all the way  
My baby goes all the way  
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah

She got the long blond hair  
Got the red sports car  
And you know she's got the  
Top laid back  
She got the movie star smile  
Got the sun kissed tan  
Santa Barbara in summer  
Yeah, she feels like that  
  
Hey she's like a canyon drive  
In a midnight sky  
Those eyes are deep enough  
To get lost  
Her legs are palm tree tall  
The way she walks  
Like the heat on a runway  
When the cameras go off  
  
She's small town from the country  
She ain't big time but she could be  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey, Hollywood never looked this good  
Bright as the big screen burns  
Hey, I bet drivin' down sunset  
They're lookin' for a face like hers  
Yeah, I've been all around this world  
And she'd be California  
If California was a girl  
  
She's like a red, red wine  
Like a righteous wave  
She's a day at the beach in Corona del Mar  
She's never been out there  
Felt the bright spot light  
But she could have her own star  
On that dreamer's boulevard  
  
I've driven down that coastline  
And I've stood there under that big sign  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'd chase that wild sunset  
I'd be gone on my way,  
Way out west  
Yeah, I've been all around this town  
  
Hey, Hollywood never looked this good  
Bright as the big screen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now she'd be California  
Hey, California  
  
She got the long blonde hair  
Got the red sports car  
And you know she's got the  
Top laid back  
She got the movie star smile  
Got the sun kissed tan  
Santa Barbara in summer  
Yeah, she feels like that  
  
Yeah, she'd be California  
Hey, Hollywood.

She's got a suitcase packed in the trunk, trunk, trunk  
She's got a see you later song that went bump, bump, bump  
She's got a hurtin heavy heart goin' thump, thump, thump  
She's leaving  
She's got a bucket of tears goin' drop, drip, drop  
And that ring on her finger is comin' off, off, off  
She's got a boyfriend yelling to stop, stop, stop  
She's leaving  
  
Should have done this, should have done that  
Should have seen it comin', guess you don't see nothing when you're runnin'
'round  
She's history, wrapped in a memory,  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that will never be  
She's leaving (she's leaving now)  
  
She left your dreams in the washing machine, chine, chine  
Now she's a red light turning to green, green, green  
She's a goner if you know what I mean, mean, mean  
She's leaving  
  
Should have done this, should have done that  
Should have seen it comin', guess you don't see nothing when you're runnin'
'round  
She's history, wrapped in a memory,  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that'll never be  
She's leaving  
Oh no, she's leaving  
  
Look at her go down right over your road,  
Sayin' to herself shoulda done this a long time ago  
  
Should have done this, should have done that  
Should have seen it comin', guess you don't see nothing when you're runnin'
'round  
She's history, wrapped in a memory,  
Tied up tight with a broken heart strings of the things that will never be  
She's, she's, she's leaving!  
She's leaving  
  
She's got a suitcase packed in the trunk, trunk, trunk  
She's got a see you later song that went bump, bump, bump  
She's got a hurtin heavy heart that went thump, thump, thump  
She's leaving (She's leaving)  
She's got a bucket of tears goin' drop, drip, drop  
And that ring on her finger is comin' off, off, off  
She's got a boyfriend yelling to stop, stop, stop  
She's leaving  
She's leaving man  
  
Look at her go down right over your road  
She's leaving, she's leaving, leaving

I was lost in darkness and sinking sand  
Well I was barely nothing, a broken man  
But you picked up the pieces of my heart in your hand  
Then you came and showed to me love's second chance  
  
[Chorus]  
Shine on, shine on, shine on me  
Whenever something's missing  
You're exactly what I need  
Your love has shown me the light and now I finally see  
Shine on, shine on, shine on me  
  
Lord knows that I'm not perfect but I sure do try  
And I see the man that I can be in your eyes  
Well there are times I still get lost in yesterday  
But you out the past behind me and you light my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shine on, shine on, shine on me  
Won't you keep on shining, yeah  
Won't you keep on shining your love  
Down on me, baby  
  
Won't you keep on shining, yeah  
Won't you keep on shining your love  
Yeah, you're exactly what I need, baby  
Yeah, you are

Sarah Beth is scared to death  
To hear what the doctor will say  
She hasn't been well  
Since the day that she fell  
  
And the bruises just won't go away  
So she sits and see waits with her mother and dad  
Flips through an old magazine  
'Til a the nurse with a smile  
  
Stands at the door  
And says will you please come with me  
  
Sarah Beth is scared to death  
Cause the doctor just told her the news  
Between the red cells and white  
Something's not right  
But we're gonna take care of you  
  
Six chances in ten it won't come back again  
With the therapy were gonna try  
It's just been approved  
It's the strongest there is  
I think we caught it in time  
  
Sarah Beth closes her eyes  
She dreams she's dancing  
Around and around without any cares  
And her very first love is holding her close  
And the soft wind in blowing her hair  
  
Sarah Beth is scared to death  
As she sits holding her mom  
Says it would be a mistake  
For someone to take  
A girl with no hair to the prom  
  
Oh, just this morning right there on her pillow  
Was the cruelest of any surprise  
And she cried when she gathered it all in her hands  
The proof that she couldn't deny  
  
Sarah Beth closes her eyes  
She dreams she's dancing  
Around and around without any cares  
And her very first love was holding her close  
And the soft wind is blowing her hair  
  
Its quarter to seven  
That boys at the door  
And her daddy ushers him in  
And when he takes off his cap  
They all start to cry  
Cause this mornin' where his hair had been  
Softly she touches just skin  
  
And they go dancin'  
Around and around without any cares  
And her very first true love was holding her close  
And for a moment she isn't scared

You feel like a candle in a hurricane  
Just like a picture with a broken frame  
Alone and helpless, like you've lost your fight  
But you'll be all right, you'll be all right  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause when push comes to shove  
You taste what you're made of  
You might bend till you break  
'Cause it's all you can take  
On your knees, you look up  
Decide you've had enough  
You get mad, you get strong  
Wipe your hands, shake it off  
Then you stand, then you stand  
  
Life's like a novel with the end ripped out  
The edge of a canyon with only one way down  
Take what you're given before it's gone  
And start holdin' on, keep holdin' on  
  
'Cause when push comes to shove  
You taste what you're made of  
You might bend till you break  
'Cause it's all you can take  
On your knees, you look up  
Decide you've had enough  
You get mad, you get strong  
Wipe your hands, shake it off  
Then you stand, yeah, then you stand  
  
Every time you get up  
And get back in the race  
One more small piece of you  
Starts to fall into place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, then you stand, yeah  
Yeah, baby  
Woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo, woo hoo  
Then you stand, yeah, yeah

I had all but given up  
On finding the one that I could fall into  
On the day before you  
  
There was no such thing as a dream come true  
Oh, but that was on the day before you  
  
Now you're here and everything's changing  
Suddenly life means so much  
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow  
And find out this promise is true  
I will never have to go back to  
The day before you  
  
In your eyes I see forever  
It makes me wish that my life never knew  
The day before you  
Oh, but Heaven knows those years without you  
  
Were shapin' my heart for the day that I found you  
You're the reason for all that I've been through  
Then I'm thankful for the day before you-  
Yeah, yeah  
  
Now you're here and everything's changing  
Suddenly life means so much  
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow  
And find out this promise is true  
I will never have to go back to  
The day before you  
  
Was the last day that I ever lived alone  
And I'm never goin' back  
No, I'm never goin' back  
  
Now you're here and everything's changing  
Suddenly life means so much  
I can't wait to wake up tomorrow  
And find out this promise is true  
I will never have to go back to  
Yeah, I will never have to go back to  
The day before you, the day before you

I guess it's cause and effect  
Your heart and mine  
The way that we connect  
Keeps blowing my mind  
There you go again, it never ends  
What you do to me  
  
[Chorus]  
That I have seen the light of day  
Love is finally going my way  
Is it too good to be true  
Give me one more kiss, one more touch  
Baby, I just can't get enough of you  
This time too good is true  
  
All of a sudden  
I'm not who I used to be  
I had my heart locked  
But you held the key  
And you find a way, everday  
To show me even more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some people say we're too good to be true  
But they don't get to be loved by you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh this time, too good is true  
Yes it is, yeah

Yeah yeah yeah, hey  
  
So, so you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Cracked a rib when you hit the wall  
Yeah, you've had a pocket full of regrets  
Pull you down faster than a sunset  
Hey, it happens to us all  
  
When the cold hard rain just won't quit  
And you can't see your way out of it  
  
[Chorus]  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
You take back what's been taken  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing, don't give in  
It'll come and make you whole again  
It always will, it always does  
Love is unstoppable  
  
Love, it can wear the ring of stone  
Bring you back to being born again  
oh, it's a helping hand when you need it most  
A lighthouse shining on the coast  
That never goes dim  
  
When your heart is full of doubt  
And you think that there's no way out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like a river keeps on rolling  
Like the north wind blowing  
Don't it feel good knowing, yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is unstoppable  
So you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Love, love is unstoppable

Ooh  
So, so you made a lot of mistakes  
Walked down the road a little sideways  
Cracked a brick when you hit the wall  
Yeah, so you didn't do your best  
It pulled you down faster than a sunset  
Hey it happens to us all  
When the cold hard rain just won't quit  
And you can't see your way out of it  
  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
Here's your chance and it's worth taking  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing don't give in  
You've got the strength to raise the wind  
Remember what one dream can do  
You are unstoppable  
  
You, you can weather any storm  
Don't you know that you were born to win  
Oh, you find a helping hand when you need it most  
A lighthouse shining on the coast that never goes dim  
When your back's against the wall  
When you, when you stumble and you fall  
  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
Here's your chance and it's worth taking  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing don't give in  
You've got the strength to raise the wind  
Remember what one dream can do  
You are unstoppable  
  
Like a river keeps on rolling  
Like a north wind blowing  
Don't it feel good knowing  
Yeah  
  
You find your faith has been lost and shaken  
You take back what's been taken  
Get on your knees and dig down deep  
You can do what you think is impossible  
Keep on believing don't give in  
You've got the strength to raise the wind  
Remember what one dream can do  
You are unstoppable  
  
Yes you, you are unstoppable  
So you made a lot of mistakes  
But you got right back into the game  
You, you are unstoppable

Walk The llama llama  
Walk The llama llama  
Take in the panorama  
Walk The llama llama - llama llama  
Don't have to be a drama  
Walk The llama llama - llama llama  
No one could be calmer  
Walk The llama llama  
Walk The llama llama  
Double L. A. M. A  
  
Fluff up your fur  
Stick out your chest  
Walk The llama llama  
Now your looking your best  
Keep out the wind  
Keep out the snow  
Wool by llama from head to toe  
  
Walk The llama llama - llama llama  
Take in the panorama  
Walk The llama llama  
Walk The llama llama  
Double L. A. M. A  
  
Cool in the summer  
Warm in the cold  
A perfect fashion statement  
For the young and the old  
A cloak for the priest  
A hat for the farmer  
You could be looking at the emperor's pajamas  
  
That's way the llama walks so proud  
That's way the llama holds his head up in the crowd  
All of us applaud his generosity  
He's more than just a passing curiosity  
He covers up our pride  
And all those things we have to hide  
In any civilized society  
  
Walk The llama llama

I spent the morning at an old friend's grave  
Flowers and Amazing Grace, he was a good man  
He spent his whole life spinnin' his wheels  
Never knowin' how the real thing feels  
He never took a chance or took the time to dance  
And I stood there thinking as I said goodbye  
Today is the first day of the rest of my life  
  
I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on  
And learn how to face my fears  
Love with all of my heart, make my mark  
I want to leave something here  
  
[Chorus]  
Go out on a ledge, with out any net  
That's what I'm gonna be about  
Yeah I want to be runnin'  
When the sand runs out  
  
'Cause people do it everyday  
Promise themselves they're gonna change  
I've been there, but I'm changin' from the inside out  
  
That was then and this is now  
I'm a new man, yeah, I'm a brand new man  
And when they carve my stone they'll write these words  
"Here lies a man who lived life for all that its worth"  
  
I'm gonna stop lookin' back and start movin' on  
Learn how to face my fears  
Love with all of my heart, make my mark  
I want to leave something here  
  
Go out on a ledge, with out any net  
That's what I'm gonna be about  
Yeah I want to be runnin'  
When the sand runs out  
  
And as the cold wind blows  
Across the graveyard  
I think I hear the voice  
Of my old friend  
Whisper in my ear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to be runnin' when  
The sand runs out  
Ooo, yes I do

There you are standing strong  
I'm a leaf holding on  
You believe like a child  
In this fire running wild  
Oh I love how you see right to the heart of me  
  
You're a waterfall washing over me  
I'm a thirsty man let me drink you in  
I am on my way  
You're a mountain top  
  
When I reach for you  
Your love lifts me up  
And all that I want is to be  
Where you are  
  
I'm the frozen ground  
You're the warm sunlight  
Shining down on me  
Baby, just in time  
  
I have never been in love like this  
Oh, you move my soul every time we kiss  
And I love how you heal  
I can't believe how alive I feel  
  
You're a waterfall washing over me  
I'm a thirsty man let me drink you in  
I am on my way  
You're a mountain top  
  
When I reach for you  
Your love lifts me up  
And all that I want is to be  
Where you are

If I ever write the story of my life  
Don't be surprised if you're where it begins  
Girl, I'd have to dedicate every line on every page  
To the memories we made, while you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me  
  
I'd start with chapter one, love innocent and young  
As the morning sun on a new day  
Even though I know the end, Well I'd do it all again  
'Cause I got a lifetime in, while you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me  
  
I was born the day you kissed me  
And I died inside the night you left me  
But I lived, oh how I lived  
(I lived) While you loved me

In a book in a box in the closet  
In a line in a song I once heard  
In a moment on a front porch late one June  
In a breath inside a whisper beneath the moon  
  
There it was at the tip of my fingers  
There it was on the tip of my tongue  
There you were, and I had never been that far  
There it was: the whole world wrapped inside my arms  
And I let it all slip away  
  
[Chorus]  
What do I do now that you're gone?  
No back up plan, no second chance  
And no one else to blame  
All I can hear in the silence that remains  
Are the words I couldn't say  
  
There's a rain that'll never stop falling  
There's a wall that I've tried to take down  
What I should've said just wouldn't pass my lips  
So I held back, and now we've come to this  
And it's too late now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Are the words I couldn't say  
  
I should have found a way to tell you how I felt  
Now the only one I'm tellin' is myself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What do I do, what do I say?  
And no one else to blame  
All I can hear in the silence that remains  
Are the words I couldn't say

Ooo, ooo, ooo  
  
Do I cry in the night?  
Do I long to hold you tight?  
Do I wake wanting you?  
Yes I do  
  
Do I recall every day  
How you took my breath away?  
Do I remember loving you?  
Yes I do  
  
[Chorus]  
Yes, I do dream of all we had together  
Yes it's true we lost it all forever?  
Do I pray, anyway?  
Yes I do  
  
I don't live in the past  
Wanting love that wouldn't last  
And I don't ache like I used to  
Yes I do  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
Yes I do  
Do I pray?  
Yes, I do dream of all we had together  
  
Yes I do  
And yes, I do

[Chorus]  
Every road that I've been down  
The only truth that I have found  
There's only one thing I can't live without  
You  
  
I was searching for something I thought I would never find  
Losing my mind  
In and out of bad love, I though I was born to lose  
Then came you  
I thought I knew what the real thing was  
But nothing shakes me like your love does  
I've been hypnotized  
Now I realize  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every time I get lost in a temperamental mood  
You still stay cool  
Just when I think this life's about to drive me insane  
You take the reins  
  
Every time I feel I'm drifting off course  
You're my compass, you're my one true north  
In a mixed up world  
You make sense to me world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah, every road baby  
Leads me to you  
And baby, that's all I need to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Every road that I've been down  
The only truth that I have found  
There's only one thing I can't live without  
You  
  
Every road that I've been down in my life  
Every time I feel I'm taking off  
Every road that I've been down in my life  
Every road girl, leads me to you  
Yes it did, yes it did  
Every road girl  
Every road leads me to you
