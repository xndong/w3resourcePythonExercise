I'm sorry, mother I'm sorry, I let you down  
Well, these days I'm fine  
No these days I tend to lie  
I'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam  
Just by my left brain, just by the side of the Tin man  
  
I'm sorry, brother I'm sorry, I let cha down  
Well, these days you're fine  
No these days you tend to lie  
You'll take the West train, just by the side of Amsterdam  
Just by your left brain, just by the side of the Tin man  
  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
But I keep coming up short  
  
I'm sorry, lover You're sorry, I bring you down  
Well, these days I try and these days I tend to lie  
Kinda thought I was a mystery and then I thought I wasn't meant to be  
You said yourself fantastically, "Congratulations you were all alone"  
  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
  
But the rain won't fall for the both of us  
The sun won't shine on the both of us  
Believe me when I say, that I wouldn't have it any other way  
  
Your time will come if you wait for it, if you wait for it  
It's hard, believe me I've tried  
But I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down  
And I won't wait much longer 'cause these walls they're crashing down  
And I keep coming up short

Emma stood in front of me  
Tellin' me what I'm supposed to be  
Jackie loves to run and hide  
Give her love, and she will die  
  
Calling me, oh my oh my  
Cross my heart and hope to die  
Bourbon streets and bicycles  
Holding you in carnivals  
  
Baby is my love too old for you?  
Baby is my love too old for you?  
'Cause Emma I'm for you  
Emma I'm for you  
  
Dinner bells and loaded gun  
Innocence is bound to run  
Enemies are playing from  
But don't you touch that golden sun  
  
Innoncence and sentiment  
Is owned by hope it's where you're at  
Baby is my love too old for you?  
Emma I'm for you  
Emma I'm for you  
  
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it  
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it  
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it  
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it  
  
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it  
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it  
Hell and silence, I can fight it, I can fight it  
Hell and silence, Emma I'm for you  
  
Emma I'm for you  
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you  
Emma I'm for you, you, you, you  
Emma I'm for you  
Emma I'm for you  
Emma I'm for you  
Emma I'm for you  
Emma I'm for you

I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
I'm the colorless sunrise  
That's never good enough  
I'm the wind that's in your head  
It ruffles you up  
You could find the reason  
You could let me know  
I won't blame you  
I'll just turn and go  
  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
Coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
My mind is made up  
My feelings changed and  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
Searching to find myself  
And all I find is you  
I could hardly stand myself  
So what am I to you?  
You could find a reason  
You could let me know  
I won't blame you  
I just didn't go  
  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
Coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
My mind is made up  
My feelings changed and  
I'm coming home to you  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
No matter, no matter  
No matter what we're facing  
It don't matter, it don't matter  
'Cause the reason that I'm here  
Is the same through all these years  
Not changing, not changing anything at all  
  
I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)  
Every night every night every night every night  
Coming home to you (I'm coming home)  
Every night every night every night every night  
  
My mind is made up  
My feelings changed and  
I'm coming home to you (I'm coming home)  
Every night every night every night every night

Run for cover, my sense of fear is running thin  
Undercover, just like a candle in the wind  
  
Tell everybody, tell everybody  
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming  
  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Now we're just gonna ride it out  
  
Every morning, I'm staring shadows in the eye  
Oh good morning, will you just wait until I die?  
  
Tell everybody, tell everybody  
Brothers, sisters, the ending is coming  
  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Now we're just gonna ride it out  
  
Tell everybody, tell everybody  
Tell everybody, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Oh, we are fallen, we are fallen  
Now we're just gonna ride it out  
  
I just want to take it in  
Even when your fire runs out  
Will you start it up again?  
We are fallen

Try to hear my voice  
You can leave, now it's your choice  
  
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right  
Maybe if I leave tonight, I won't come back  
  
I said it before, I won't say it again  
Love is a game to you, it's not pretend  
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right  
  
Can nobody hear me?  
I've got a lot that's on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it, too?  
  
You kiss and you kiss  
And you love and you love  
You've got a history list and the rest is above  
And if you're warm then you can't relate to me  
From the floor to the floor  
And the sky to the sky  
You've got to love and adore and the rest is a lie  
And if you're warm, then you can't relate to me  
  
I said it before, I won't say it again  
Love is a game to you, let's not pretend  
Maybe if I fall asleep, I won't breathe right, right, right  
  
Can nobody hear me?  
I've got a lot that's on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it, too?  
  
Leave your shoes at the door, baby  
I am all you adore, lately  
Come with me and we will run away  
  
Can nobody hear me?  
I've got a lot that's on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it, too?  
Can nobody hear me?  
I've got a lot that's on my mind  
I cannot breathe  
Can you hear it, too?

Did your mother like your Sunday dress  
Astrology eradicated  
So what, so what?  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
I'm not out for us to fly or be set free  
So what, so what?  
I'd show you, you'd show me, so much, so much  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
Your blood, it flows in from the western sea  
Your eyes, they shine in through this shaded tree  
Oh I believe in you  
These places, they have changed  
I don't know anything but you know me,  
Oh, you know me  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
  
It's all that we've got  
It's all that we can give  
Believe it or not,  
It's all that we can give, and I don't mind  
At all

Welcome to the land of fire  
I hope you brought the right attire,  
The crippled man is waiting at the door  
  
He said "your eyes are much too bright"  
The things you say are never right,  
The sins of all the world lie on your head  
  
So when you see me look the other way  
Cause -ohoh- lately all I do is play  
All the glasses in the world say "come with me..."  
  
I need a minute to get my head straight  
Just to hit it before it's too late  
In a sin, considering my middle name is 'shake my body'  
Take a seat it's glittering, I shake you in, I shake my body  
  
Welcome to the land of fail  
I hope you brought your soul for sale  
The greeter's still at home I think he died  
  
The land of smash and fairy tale  
The truth of life is close to hell  
The best you'll be is nearly dead or failed  
  
So when you see me look the other way  
Cause lately all I do is say  
These the plans I make believe all come with me  
  
Oh, perhaps it's all a dream and make believe  
Oh, the last of all my dreams but still leave me

4 am, beside myself  
And what I think of mental health  
All the things that worry me  
All the things you don't believe  
I've been told just what to do  
Where to look, and point my view  
All the things that I could be  
I think I learnt in therapy  
  
Am I just a shadow you drew?  
  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
Looking back into the past and I can see it through  
  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
  
Mocking birds and diamond rings  
Oh I have thought of greater things  
All the things that fly by me  
All the lives that I could lead  
Maybe I was born for that  
Or maybe I was first to last  
You could call it cowardess  
But leave me to my studied bliss  
Am I just a shadow you drew?  
  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
All the things that you had lost will find their way to you  
It comes back to you, it comes back to you  
Looking back into the past and I can see it through  
  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you  
It comes back to you

So this is what you meant  
When you said that you were spent  
And now it's time to build from the bottom of the pit, right to the top  
Don't hold back  
Packing my bags and giving the Academy a rain check  
  
I don't ever want to let you down  
I don't ever want to leave this town  
Cause after all  
This city never sleeps at night  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was  
Now don't you understand  
I'm never changing who I am  
  
So this is where you fell  
And I am left to sell  
The path to heaven runs through miles of clouded hell right to the top  
Don't look back  
Turning to rags and giving the commodities a rain check  
  
I don't ever want to let you down  
I don't ever want to leave this town  
Cause after all  
This city never sleeps at night  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was  
Now don't you understand  
I'm never changing who I am  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was  
Now don't you understand  
I'm never changing who I am  
  
This road never looked so lonely  
This house doesn't burn down slowly  
To ashes  
To ashes  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was  
Now don't you understand  
I'm never changing who I am  
  
It's time to begin, isn't it?  
I get a little bit bigger but then I'll admit  
I'm just the same as I was  
Now don't you understand  
I'm never changing who I am

Take a look inside  
I've got nothing to hide, oh, no  
I'll beat around the bush  
I've got nothing but time, oh no, oh no  
  
You've got me holding on to nothing  
But nothing is all I've got  
  
[Chorus:]  
Leave me, leave me,  
I'm a shut it all down  
You've got a tendency to bring a man down  
I give up, I give up  
You've gotta get a gun to make a woman run  
  
So this is what it feels like  
I'll give you the last word  
It's alright, it's alright, it's alright  
  
Now this is the town, this is the place  
If you are the one to give disgrace a name  
Then So be it  
  
You've got me holding on to nothing  
But nothing is all I've got  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
Oh take my car, oh take my house  
I never liked that beat up motor mouth  
And it only looks so warm tonight  
Just like a stranger in the candlelight  
  
Take take take take  
Take it all  
  
[Chorus 2x]  
  
Leave me now  
Leave me now

[Verse 1]  
There's so much on my mind  
I don't know where to start  
There's that light in your eye filling up the dark  
Though, I lost myself  
I know it's not the end  
You're my shooting star  
You make my heart ascend  
  
[Chorus]  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
  
[Verse 2]  
I know that we're far from where we need to be  
But the world wasn't made in just one day  
Though our journey's long, I know our love is strong  
You're my shooting star  
We're flying high above  
  
[Chorus]  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
  
[Bridge]  
When I'm stuck in the middle of hell and faith  
And I don't know where to turn  
To bend my mind as the silver gate  
You lead me on my way  
  
(Oooooo)  
(Oooooo)  
(Oooooo)  
(Oooooo)  
  
[Chorus]  
(Oooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Oooooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
(Ooooooo)  
(Ooooooo)  
  
[Outro]  
Just levitate, just levitate  
(Ooooooo)  
Just levitate, just levitate

[Intro]  
  
[Verse 1]  
Take me on a whim  
It's not the sun that provides us  
It's not the moon that divides us  
  
[Verse 2]  
I can barely swim  
And the current's coming in  
And the current's coming in again  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Stand up when you hear your name  
'Cus I think that we're the same  
We've got the same old hands  
We've made the same old plans  
  
Bail out to the yellow raft  
It's got a hole but we can last  
We'll watch until it fades away  
  
[Chorus]  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
[Verse 3]  
I've been painted gin  
It's not the colour I came in  
It's not the shirt that I stayin' in  
  
[Verse 4]  
Hang me on a limb  
And the current's coming in  
And the current's coming in again  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Stand up when you hear your name  
'Cus I think that we're the same  
We've got the same old hands  
We've made the same old plans  
  
Bail out to the yellow raft  
It's got a hole but we can last  
We'll watch until it fades away  
  
[Chorus]  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
Stop right there  
I've got a hole inside my chest  
And 'til it fills up  
I won't be satisfied  
  
Stop right there  
I've got a hole inside my chest  
And 'til it fills up  
I won't be satisfied  
  
Stop right there  
I've got a hole inside my chest  
And 'til it fills up  
  
[Chorus]  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
Time is taking over  
Look how far we've come  
Some were never meant to come here  
Some were never meant to leave the ground  
  
It's time to take it over  
Step out into the sun  
  
It's time to take it over  
And look how far we've come  
  
We've come...

Oh, dig my shallow grave  
It's not me you'll save  
Cause I'm a lost cause  
I'm a lost cause  
A lost, lost cause  
  
Wait, all this time that I have spent away  
Makes me think that I might be okay  
For this, the deaf will have to wait  
My head, is holding on to all those things you said  
You taught me to be strong and get through it, the mist of darkness  
In my head  
  
Oh, dig my shallow grave  
It's not me you'll save  
Cause I'm a lost cause  
I'm a lost cause  
A lost, lost cause  
  
Wait, no one said what's lost cannot be found  
You are here to make it safe and sound  
Oh we, can make it, out alive  
Fate, hath its way when all that's learned is sin  
Nothing really matters in the end  
As long, as you, are with me, friend  
  
Oh, dig my shallow grave  
It's not me you'll save  
Cause I'm a lost cause  
I'm a lost cause  
A lost, lost cause  
  
No one can understand me  
Like you can understand  
No one can fill your shadow  
Cause you are all I am  
  
Oh, dig my shallow grave  
It's not me you'll save  
Cause I'm a lost cause  
I'm a lost cause  
A lost, lost cause

Who knows how long  
I've been awake now?  
The shadows on my wall don't sleep  
They keep calling me  
Beckoning...  
Who knows what's right?  
The lines keep getting thinner  
My age has never made me wise  
But I keep pushing on and on and on and on  
  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
  
Below my soul  
I feel an engine  
Collapsing as it sees the pain  
If I could only shut it out  
I've come too far  
To see the end now  
Even if my way is wrong  
I keep pushing on and on and on and on  
  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
  
I keep falling, I keep falling down...  
If you could only save me  
I'm drowning in the waters of my soul  
  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...  
There's nothing left to say now...  
I'm giving up, giving up, hey hey, giving up now...

You've got me feeling like a pantomime  
That's why I only love you part time  
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,  
Don't you, don't you touch me no more"  
  
You got me feeling like a paradigm  
Your friends all want me in the meantime  
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,  
Don't you, don't you touch me no more"  
  
Hey, you got all the money, honey  
Your eyes are looking runny and red  
Hey, you think all your friends are funny  
But all your friends are way overfed  
  
You left me, baby, for another man  
He's looking tall, he's got a deep tan  
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,  
Don't you, don't you touch me no more"  
  
He's got religious with the rhinestones  
Takes care of business on his cellphone  
It's just a matter of "oh, don't touch me,  
Don't you dare touch me no more"  
  
Hey, you got all the money, honey  
Your eyes are looking runny and red  
Hey, you think all your friends are funny  
But all your friends are way overfed  
  
If you've gotta go, I won't stop you  
You'll hear me singing you  
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"  
  
If he's got a chest and some arms  
He'll hear me singing you  
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"  
  
Hey, you got all the money, honey  
Your eyes are looking runny and red  
Hey, you think all your friends are funny  
But all your friends are way overfed  
  
If you've gotta go, I won't stop you  
You'll hear me singing you  
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"  
  
If he's got a chest and some arms  
He'll hear me singing you  
"Glory! Glory! Hallelujah... You've made it easy for the both of us"

[Verse 1]  
I'm a reckless mistake  
I'm a cold night's intake  
I'm a one night too long  
I'm a come on too strong  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm a hold my cards close  
I'm a wreck what I love most  
I'm a first class letdown  
I'm a "shut up, sit down"  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I am a headcase  
I am the color of boom  
That's never arriving, and  
You are the pay raise  
Always a touch out of view  
And I am the color of boom  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Chorus 2]  
How did it come to this?  
Love is a Polaroid  
Better in a picture  
Never could fill the void  
  
[Verse 3]  
I'm a midnight talker  
I'm an alley walker  
I'm a day late two-face  
I'm a burn out quick pace  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Chorus 2]  
How did it come to this?  
Love is a Polaroid  
Better in a picture  
Never could fill the void  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm gonna get ready  
For the rain to pour heavy  
Let it fall, fall  
Let it fall upon my head  
  
[Chorus 1]  
All my life, I've been living in the fast lane  
Can't slow down, I'm a rolling freight train  
One more time, gotta start all over  
Can't slow down, I'm a lone red rover  
  
[Chorus 2]  
How did it come to this?  
Love is a Polaroid  
Better in a picture  
Never could fill the void  
  
Love is a Polaroid

I'm waking up to ash and dust,  
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust,  
I'm breathing in, the chemicals.  
I'm breaking in, shaping up, then checking out on the prison bus.  
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa.  
  
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones.  
Enough to make my systems blow.  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive.  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive.  
  
I raise my flags, don my clothes,  
It's a revolution I suppose.  
Were painted red, to fit right in, whoa.  
I'm breaking in, shaping up, checking out on the prison bus.  
This is it, the apocalypse, whoa.  
  
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones.  
Enough to make my systems blow.  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive.  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive.  
  
All systems go, sun hasn't died.  
Deep in my bones, straight from inside.  
  
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones.  
Enough to make my systems blow.  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age.  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive.  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive.

With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
  
Off in the distance  
There is resistance  
Bubbling up and festering  
Hey Mr.Motion  
Make me a potion  
Shake it all up  
With your mistery  
How come I've never seen  
Your face round here  
I know every single face  
round here  
A man on a mission  
Changing the vision  
I was never welcome here  
We don't have the choice to stay  
We'd rather die than  
Do it your way  
  
With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
  
Checking the casing  
Shaking and pacing  
This is the tunnels life  
Blood in the writting  
Stuck in the fighting  
Look through the rifle's right  
How come I've never seen  
Your face round here  
I know every single face  
round here  
Hearing the heckle  
Holding the shackle  
I was never welcome here  
We don't have the choice to stay  
We'd rather die than  
Do it your way  
  
With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
  
Ooooohhhhh  
Oh oh  
Oooohhhhhh  
Oh ooooohhh oh  
Oh oooohhhh  
Ooooohhhhh  
  
With our backs to the wall  
The darkness will fall  
We never quite thought  
We could lose it all  
  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire  
An empire is falling  
In just one day  
You close your eyes  
And the glory fades  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away  
Ready aim fire  
Ready aim fire away

Where do we go from here?  
Where do we go from here?  
I threw some rocks up at your window  
I broke some rocks right through your window  
  
Timber, timber  
We're falling down  
Let the forest hear our sound  
Boom ba boom ba boom  
Ah ooo ah ooo  
Boom ba boom ba boom  
Ah ooo ah ooo  
Why can't I see  
What's right in front of me?  
  
We fall  
We fall apart  
We fall  
We fall apart  
We fall  
We fall apart  
We fall  
We fall apart

To the top of all the world  
To the tasteless underworld  
To the center of your heart, oh Cleopatra is the only one you loved  
To the demonstrated smile  
To the lonely love child  
Destination desolation, tell me when you reach the brink of life  
Just a picture on your wall  
Thats nice, what a metaphoric fall  
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve  
Oh what an indication  
To the center of the pain  
Through your tattered window pane  
To the middle of your heart  
  
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen  
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing  
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene  
  
This is not what I expect, this is not what I expect  
I can see it in your tears and now they're crowning me the Caesar  
Typically, I was a validation on your sleeve  
Oh what an indication  
To the center of the pain  
Through your tattered window pane  
To the middle of your heart  
  
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen  
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing  
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene  
  
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene  
  
Resolutions and lovers in the kitchen  
Love is clueless and destiny is wishing  
This is my heart, it's on the line, Selene

[Verse 1]  
If only for a second  
Let me have you  
Tell me all your secrets  
Let me know you  
  
Paint me all your pictures  
Hang them on my wall  
Show me all your colors  
Show me all of those  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
  
[Verse 2]  
A fire burns into you  
Purifying all  
And what I saw was opulence  
And that's not for me  
And that's not for me  
And that's not for me  
  
[Bridge]  
Only in the summertime  
Only in the summertime  
Things will change with time  
Only in the summertime  
  
[Chorus]  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
Open up your eyes, open up your mind  
Follow in line with what you're meant to be  
  
[Bridge]  
Only in the summertime  
Only in the summertime  
Things will change with time  
Only in the summertime

In the latest midnight hour  
When the world has gone to sleep  
You gotta get up  
When doubts begin to rise  
And the world is at your feet  
You gotta get up  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself  
  
I'm not a selfless man  
I'm not a man of wealth  
If I had all the world,  
Probably give it to myself  
But the trees begin to walk  
And the ground begins to talk  
And myself  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself  
  
Hold my place  
Don't you give up on me  
Hold on, hold on  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself  
  
Reach, It's not as bad as it seems  
I cleanse in the river for somebody else,  
For anyone but myself

[Verse 1]  
Oh quiet down, I've had enough  
I guess it's now or never  
I've been around, I've settled up  
I'll go soon or later  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I took a photograph of me  
And I was only nineteen  
I looked a little lost at sea  
I keep trying to find me  
  
[Chorus]  
Break for me brother, I need redemption  
I'm just a man, a man on a mission  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
  
Break for me sister, give me a mention  
I've got no faith and oh did I mention  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
I want no trouble, I want no trouble  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll pack it up, and hit the road  
And only take my lighter  
I've seen the glitz, I've seen the glam  
But I prefer the pay dirt  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge] x2  
Maybe you can save my soul  
With all the things that I don't know  
  
[Chorus]

Say goodbye to all your friends  
They will miss you when this trends  
I get so uptight, I get so uptight  
I get so uptight, I get so uptight  
  
(Hey) Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go  
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go  
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it  
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it  
  
When the current drags me in (when the current drags me in)  
Leave me to the hands of men (leave me to the hands of men)  
I get so uptight, I get so uptight  
I get so uptight, I get so uptight  
  
(Hey) Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go  
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go  
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it  
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it  
  
(Hey) Sit tight green light everybody's out at night, go  
Why don't you beeline, outshine, everybody blow your mind, go  
Why don't you see what they're saying, it's crazy, I've seen it  
Those things they believe in, they get hazy, I think I mean it

Up in the morning,  
Up in the evening,  
Picking down talks when the birds get back to me.  
Oh, to me.  
  
Up on the mountain,  
Down in the king's lair,  
Pushing these boxes in the heat of the afternoon.  
Oh, afternoon.  
  
We were never welcome here,  
We were never welcome here at all.  
No.  
  
It's who we are.  
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.  
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.  
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.  
  
Save us,  
What we are,  
Don't look clear,  
It's all uphill from here.  
Ooh.  
  
Up in the attic,  
Down in the cellar,  
Lost in a static,  
Coming back for more.  
Oh, for more.  
  
Out with the reason,  
In with the season,  
Taking down names in my book of jealousy.  
Jealousy.  
  
We were never welcome here.  
We were never welcome here at all.  
No.  
  
It's who we are.  
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.  
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.  
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.  
Because it's who we are.  
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.  
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.  
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.  
  
Save us,  
What we are,  
Don't look clear,  
It's all uphill from here.  
Ooh.  
  
They say we're crazy.  
They say we're crazy.  
They say we're crazy.  
They say we're crazy.  
They say we're crazy.  
They say we're crazy.  
They say we're crazy.  
They say we're, crazy.  
  
It's who we are.  
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.  
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.  
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.  
Because it's who we are.  
Doesn't matter if we've gone too far.  
Doesn't matter if it's all okay.  
Doesn't matter if it's not our day.  
  
Why won't you save us,  
What we are,  
Don't look clear,  
It's all uphill from here.  
Ooh.

Shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
Been a long time coming for the working man  
So shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
When the money is high, we can start to spend  
  
Every little bit goes a little of a long way  
Life gets hard and I'm headed for the highway home, home  
Caught up in the middle of a headache and a heartbreak  
Just when I thought I was clear of the mistakes,  
No, no oh oh  
  
So tell me, tell me, tell me  
What am I to do  
I think that this life is darker than the view  
So help me, help me, help me  
Be a little more like you  
When everything is falling  
I'm gonna do the things you do  
  
Shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
Been a long time coming for the working man  
Shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
When the money is high, we can start to spend  
Shake it  
  
Everything is serious and everything is fatal  
That's what they tell you  
And that's how they make you know, know  
I'm tired of the books and I'm tired of the tables  
Everything is made with the same old labels  
No, no oh oh  
  
So tell me, tell me, tell me  
What am I to do  
I think that this life is darker than the view  
So help me, help me, help me  
Be a little more like you  
When everything is falling  
I'm gonna do the things you do  
  
Shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
Been a long time coming for the working man  
Shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
When the money is high, we can start to spend  
When the money is high, we can start to spend  
Shake it  
  
Shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
Been a long time coming for the working man  
Shake it, shake it  
And we're moving again  
When the money is high, we can start to spend  
Shake it, Shake it  
Shake it, Shake it
