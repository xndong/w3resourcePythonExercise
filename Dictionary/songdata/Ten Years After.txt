The love that you gave me has gone with the rain  
The joy that just filled me has turned into pain  
  
My face in the mirror reminds me of you  
It's the one that you lied to when you said you'd be true  
  
The tears in my eyes are all that you'll find  
The scars on my face just deepen my mind  
  
The love that you gave me has gone with the rain  
The joy that just filled me has turned into pain

A thousand cities in the night  
Each one waiting for the light  
Ten million people plan their day  
As the sun still burns away  
  
As the earth just spins in space  
People plan their daily race  
As the sun still burns away  
Few say "Thank you for the day"  
All the people in their ties  
Forget to look up at the sky  
they exist another day  
As the sun still burns away  
  
I wonder just how long we'll last  
When the final die is cast  
Every day brings forth the time  
When the sun forgets to shine

Baby, won't you let me rock 'n' roll you  
Baby, won't you let me, let me stroll you  
Baby, won't you let me rock 'n' roll you now  
  
Baby, won't you let me, let me shake you  
Baby, won't you let me, let me break you  
Baby, won't you let me really take you now  
  
Well, you remember, baby, how it used to be  
I used to rock 'n' roll you around my knee  
Well, I tell you, honey, gonna be alright  
Gonna rock 'n' roll you all through the night  
  
Baby, won't you let me, let me shake you  
Baby, won't you let me, let me break you  
Baby, won't you let me really take you now  
  
I tell you, baby, gonna be alright  
I'm gonna rock you all through the night  
Well, you [Incomprehensible] how it's gonna be  
[Incomprehensible]  
  
Baby, won't you let me sock it to you  
Baby, won't you let me sock it to you  
Baby, won't you let me rock 'n' roll you now

You ruin my day  
You ruin my night  
You ruin everything I do  
You're killing in my way  
You're killing in my life  
You're killing in everything I do  
  
You're hurting my heart  
You're hurting my pride  
You're hurting everything I own  
You're choking my head  
It's choking inside  
Why don't you leave my life alone  
  
I just want to do it like it used to be  
So, why don't you leave it up to me  
I want to tell you if you think it's right  
Baby, won't you do it right?

Choo choo Moma, won't you ride the train?  
My life without you is just misery and pain, come back to me  
I'll treat you best I can  
Choo choo Moma, you should have a choo choo man  
  
Choo choo Moma, won't you ride a rail?  
I need your loving, can't you hear me wail, come back to me  
You know I love you so  
Choo choo Moma, won't you get a choo choo home?  
  
Choo choo Moma, won't you ride the track?  
I need your loving, won't you bring some back on home to me  
I need your loving, babe  
Choo choo Moma, don't you know you drive me mad?  
  
Choo choo Moma, you're a cheery thing  
I love you, baby, can't you help me sing, come back to me  
I want you back again  
Choo choo Moma, won't you get a choo choo train?

I'd like to reach out to you  
And learn just how do you do  
So we can still relate  
I'd like to open my mind  
  
So you can come in and find  
How we communicate  
There's a chemical reaction  
And it's causing an attraction  
  
From you to me  
I am not one for convention  
But I have a good intention  
For you from me  
  
Rain is falling and a thunderbolt is crashing through my head  
And there's people and pain all around me  
Someone is calling and electric sparks are everywhere I tread  
My life, it seems, is a sequence of dreams  
And there's people and pain all around me  
  
I'm going down in a black elevator  
'Cause the big masturbator's got his eye on me  
I'm going down 'cause my brain is on fire  
And my soul is a liar 'cause I tried to be free  
Tried to be free, tried to be free...  
  
Freedom in your mind you can have when you dead  
Freedom in your life just depends on your head  
Freedom in your heart can alas never be  
'Cause no one on this earth has been born to be free  
Born to be free, born to me free...  
  
All of my life I have tried to be free  
All of my life I have learned all I see  
All of my life I have searched for a clue  
All of my life I have tried to be true  
Tried to be true, tried to be true...

Here they come, and they fly with the power of the sun  
Here they come, and they're going to touch everyone  
Far, far, have they come  
  
Here they come, and the fire on their wings doesn't burn  
Here they come, and they know everything we must learn  
Round, round, we must turn  
  
Watch out, you, sinners  
Don't you know that your time has come?  
Watch out, you, winners  
Now it's the same for everyone  
  
Here they come, and the stars in their eyes seem to glow  
Here they come, and the fear in our hearts starts to go  
Now, now, now we all know

Love is all around, I want you to see it from here  
Love is just a sound, I want you to hear it from here  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
But it's all around us just the same  
I don't know that you don't know my name  
You don't know that I don't know your name  
  
Love is all around, I want you to live it from here  
Love is just a sound, I want to sing it for here

But it's all around us just the same

You don't know that I don't know your name  
  
Peace is all around, I want you to need it from here

I may be wrong, but I won't be wrong always  
I may be wrong, but I won't be wrong always  
I love you, baby, love you in my own sweet way

When I ask questions, don't tell no lies  
Just look me in the eyes  
Don't say no and don't say maybe  
And don't ask me why  
Just say yeah, yes, yes is what to say  
Just say yeah, yes, and go along your way, ooh baby now  
  
When you need me, well I'll come running  
And that's the way to be  
Just call on me when you want some loving  
And I'll give it all for free  
I'll say yeah, yes, yes is what to say  
I'll say yeah, yes, and we'll go along a way, ooh baby now  
  
Well, we don't need no shove  
Cause I just fall in love with you, child  
Well we don't need no push  
Cause we just dig the rush with you

I woke up this morning  
My baby was gone  
I woke up this morning, Lord  
My baby was gone  
I thought that she loved me  
It seems that I'm wrong  
Yes, I am wrong  
  
I cried every night, darling  
For you to come home, yes, I do  
I cried every night, darling  
For you to come home  
I'm feeling so lonely, darling  
I'm left all alone  
Yes, I'm left all alone  
  
I woke up this morning, Lord  
The rain was falling down  
I woke up this morning, Lord  
The rain was falling down  
I'm getting so lonely, darling  
Oh, yeah, baby, I wish I could cry  
Oh, yes, the rain is falling on the ground

May be right, or may be wrong  
But I gotta do something before the day is gone  
Could be small, or could be big  
But I gotta do something that I can dig  
May be good, or may be bad  
But I gotta do something or I'm going mad  
May be cool, or may be hot  
But I gotta do something I need a lot  
  
Oh baby, don't cry, don't dry, don't cry  
You shouldn't do that  
  
I'm coming on  
Well, baby, I'm coming on  
Yeah, babe, I'm coming on

There's someone somewhere who can't go on  
Their life is crying, it's all gone wrong  
What can I say now to help you through  
Except to say that I've been there too?  
  
Your soul is aching, you can't see it through  
But time is healing each day you do  
Keep looking forward, forget the past  
It's up to you now, don't let it last  
  
You got to wake up, shake up  
You got a right to live  
Shake up, don't break up  
You've got a lot to give  
  
You'll wake up one morning, you start to feel good  
The sun in the blue sky looks like it should  
Cause time is a healer, it's strange but it's true  
So, keep looking forward, the sun will come through  
  
You got to wake up, shake up  
You got a right to live  
Shake up, don't break up  
You've got a lot to give

Let the sky fall  
Let the sea sink  
Let the earth shake  
Let the sun blink  
Let the universe  
Go spinning free  
If my darling  
Ever leaves me  
  
Let the air freeze  
Let the moon cry  
Let the stars go out  
Let the world die  
Let the eyes go blind  
Let the grass turn blue  
If I ever  
Think of leaving you  
  
Let our love be  
With our minds free  
Let our hearts beat  
Let our eyes see  
Let the universe  
Share our love  
Let me be  
What you're thinking of

You roly-poly  
All over town  
But you come on back to me  
When things are down  
Love like a man  
Love all you can  
  
Your satisfaction  
Is growing less  
If you come on back to me  
Use my address and let you  
Love like a man  
Love all you can  
  
You are the woman  
You can't deny  
You look so good to me, girl  
You make me high  
  
I'll tell you something  
I think you know  
When you flash those eyes at me  
All systems go and let you  
Love like a man  
Love all you can

My baby left me  
She wouldn't tell a lie  
Cause she said she would, she did  
And she left me high and dry  
My baby left me  
Last night I heard her cry  
She wouldn't tell me why  
She just said bye-bye  
  
I used to sing the blues  
I thought I sang for real  
Now I know the feel  
And it hurts too much  
My baby left me  
She left me all alone  
She's never coming home  
And I want to die  
  
My baby left me, my baby left me

Well, I got no worry, and I got no pain  
'Cause when I get rid of them, they come back again  
I just keep on doing what I want to do  
If I keep on trying, I'm sure to come through  
  
Well, money's no problem, it comes and it goes  
It stops me from starving, it keeps me in clothes  
There's a God and a devil, I'm sure it must be  
But why should I bother them, they don't bother me  
  
So, I'll keep on playing and do what I do  
These strings on my fingers are all that is true

Once there was a time I'd rob my mama  
For a good meal and a smoke  
Once there was a time I'd sell my brother  
For a dollar when I was broke  
  
But I'd never sell my guitar  
And my strings were always sharp  
Cause if I don't have a guitar  
I'll be strumming on some angels harp  
  
And if I don't get to heaven  
And I go down there below  
Better be a guitar when I get there  
Or, I will refuse to go  
  
Once there was a time I was hungry  
And I'd find my food in some bin  
But I'd never, never sell my guitar  
Cause that would, darling, that would be a sin

One of these days, boy  
Gonna see my baby  
Gonna see my baby  
Coming down the road  
She'll have my pardon  
Pardon in her apron, oh, Lord  
Gonna see the governor  
Who said release my man  
  
She's coming down the road, boy  
She's coming down the road  
Red dress on, yeah  
She's got her red dress on  
She's coming down the road, boy  
She's coming down the road  
Her bags down low  
She's got her bags down low  
  
One of these days, boy  
Gonna see my woman  
She'll have my children  
Children on her knee  
I'll run up to my woman  
And hold her in my arms  
Tears in her eyes  
She says I'm glad you're free

I got water on the brain  
My mind is like a drain  
Here I go again  
Over the hill  
  
My eyes don't seem too clear  
I'm not sure what I hear  
It seems I'm going clear  
Over the hill  
  
Like a cripple and his crutch  
I have leaned a bit too much  
Seems that I should never touch again  
Now it seems it's plain to see  
That this stuff is killing me  
Got to quit, so, I'll be free again  
  
I got too much to lose  
No one can fill my shoes  
Think I'll leave the blues  
Over the hill

I never really understood religion  
Except it seems a good excuse to kill  
I never really could make a decision  
I don't surpose I ever really will  
  
I can't relate to any power structure  
Where ego is the driving energy  
I let mine go long, long time ago, now  
When I decided that I would be free  
  
Only thing I understand is living  
The biggest sacrifice to make is death  
Once you're dead, there's noting left for giving  
The life means fighting your every breath

We did some rock and roll up in Texas  
And the folks from the coast towns said  
You better watch yourself up in Texas  
Or you, you might just end up dead, boy  
But the people I found  
Grooving to the sound  
Of rock and roll music in the air  
We all had a ball  
With no hassles at all  
Pretty soon I'm gonna go back there  
  
I'm singing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Ain't no relation  
To the United Nations  
Keep rock and rolling to the world  
Give peace a chance  
Get up and dance  
  
When I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
I'm gonna scream  
I'm gonna shout  
Get my emotions  
And work them all right out  
  
I want to live  
Just like I give  
No need to fight  
Wait for tonight  
When I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Ain't got no calling  
Except for balling  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Don't need no boost  
Just turn me loose  
And I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world  
I tell the truth  
I ain't no star  
I only shout  
And leave the rest to my guitar  
  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Rock and roll music to the world  
Ain't no relation  
To the United Nations  
Keep rock and rolling to the world  
Don't need no boost  
Just turn me loose  
And I sing  
Rock and roll music to the world

She lies in the morning  
Red sky is the warning, yes it is  
She lies in the morning  
Red sky is in her eyes  
She cries cause the morning is too long  
She tries, but she still can't carry on  
She lies to escape the morning sun  
She dies and the world still caries on  
  
Where did you go?  
Why did you fall?  
She didn't know there's nothing at all  
  
You killed yourself, my love  
There's nothing left for me  
Life was a pain, but now you're free  
You shot your soul, my love  
Blew all you had  
Now, I'm left here feeling bad  
You shot your life away  
For the unreal  
Now, there's nothing left to feel  
You made your tracks, my love  
You made them deep  
Now, there's nothing left but sleep

Get on the ball, boys. Let' catch that train and get on.  
  
Well, run your Chevy down the highway, doing 95  
Got his V-8 engine buzzing like a hive  
Gotta catch that mail train, just to stay alive  
  
Well, he wrote his baby a letter when he was in pain  
Well, he told his little baby "Don't want to see you again"  
Well, he's gotta drop that letter, gotta catch that train  
  
Gotta beat it to the crossing before he gets to town  
Got to keep that whistle humming, keep it to the ground  
Gotta catch that mail train, gotta flag it down  
Roll on, boy  
  
Well, he's squealing around the bend, tracks are getting near  
Well, the roaring of the engine, passing in his ear  
Well, he ain't gonna make it

I'm a spider in my web, I'm just waiting to catch a fly  
Spider in my web, baby, sitting and waiting to catch a fly  
Sitting in my web, darlin', just waiting for you to pass me by  
  
Sitting here, darlin', sitting here all alone  
I'm sitting here, baby, sitting all alone  
Baby, when I catch you, I'm gonna take you to my home  
  
My web isn't very sticky  
Pretty soon, you should know  
Baby, when I catch you, I will never let you go  
  
Spider in my web , darlin', I'm waiting to catch a fly  
Sitting in my web, baby, waiting for you to pass me by  
  
I said I'm a spider in my web, I'm just waiting to catch a fly  
Spider in my web, and I'm waiting to catch a fly  
Sitting in my web, darlin', waiting for you to pass my by  
  
Don't you know the spider  
Oh, baby, pretty soon, you're sure to find  
Well, I'm a spider, pretty soon, you're sure to find  
I'm a spider in my web, baby  
But baby, spider can be kind

Well, I'm standin' at the station  
And the rain don't make a sound  
Got a Bible in my pocket  
Cause my plane was just shot down  
My mind is all confusion  
I believe I'm in a play  
Throw my Bible out the window  
As the train goes on i'ts way  
  
Gonna leave my blues behind me  
Gonna find another town  
Gonna try and find some people  
Who this time won't bring me down  
As I step out of the carriage  
The station looks the same  
As the one I left behind me  
Though it has another name

She gonna love him, stoned out of mind all the time  
She gonna keep him, stoned out of his mind all the time  
She don't see nothing  
She just has loving and she keeps on puffing all the time  
I keep on praying  
She'll just have a flash  
She'll hear what I'm saying all the time  
Well, she's a stoned woman, baby, it's true  
Well, she's a stoned woman  
Baby, baby, baby, I don't know, really, what to do  
  
She gonna love him, stoned out of mind all the time  
She gonna keep him, stoned out of his mind all the time  
She don't see nothing  
She just has loving and she keeps on puffing all the time  
All the time  
I keep on praying  
She'll just have a flash  
She'll hear what I'm saying all the time  
All the time  
All the time  
All the time

Having a good time, baby  
You're having a ball  
Your daddy don't dig what you look like  
Don't dig it at all  
Don't understand  
What you're going through  
No, no, no, no, no, no, he don't  
  
He says there's only one way that you stay alive  
Keep working for your pension till you're sixty five  
Hey, no, no, don't dig it at all  
  
You've grown up a big girl, baby  
You're doing all right  
You sleep in the daytime, baby now  
You're leaping all night  
Got your own scene  
Said you're doing fine  
My, my, my, doing fine, girl  
  
Live like you want, let them call you a freak  
You'll be a baby factory when you're married a week  
Oh, no, no, no, can you live in a box? Get out, get out  
  
You're having a good time, baby  
You're loving your life  
There's more things ahead now, baby  
Than being a wife  
Well, I love your mind  
'Cause you know it's free  
Little darlin'  
  
Don't worry about the people who scream and shout  
Just give them fifty years and they might forget it out  
Hey, yeah, I've gotta have me a good time  
Darling, let it all hang out

All right, oh, yeah  
Come on, baby, yeah  
  
Hey baby, sure love you fine  
You got a way of moving, mama  
Make me lose my mind  
You know, mama, what you got  
Something I need, sure need a lot  
I got the rhythm, and you sure got the style  
So, shake it, mama, please stomp around a while  
Shake on  
  
Hey, baby, yes, you're doing fine  
You're stomping so good, mama  
You got the boys in the line  
Foxy mama  
You sure got what it takes  
And when you're stomping, darling  
Boy, it really shakes  
Foxy woman  
You don't tell no lies  
What you got, darling  
Sure would like to advertise  
Hear the boys say  
Look at that, mama, don't she look fine  
Love that woman, make her mine  
And you know, baby, that's where it's at  
Just stomp around, mama  
Shake it, shake it out  
Shake it, mama, oh, mama, mmm  
Shake it, mama  
Mmm, yeah, baby  
Mmm, oh, mama, yeah, yeah  
Oh, yeah  
Do the stomp  
Stomp around

Think about the times when you're happy  
Think about the times when you're sad  
Think about the life you're living  
Think about your life and be glad  
  
You are living  
You are in the world  
And your life belongs to you  
  
You are living  
You are of the earth  
And the earth is of you, too  
  
There'll be times when you're lonely  
There'll be times when you're down  
There are times when you remember  
With a smile or a frown  
  
You are living  
You are in the world  
And your life belongs to you  
  
You are living  
You are of the earth  
And the earth is of you, too

You know, tomorrow I'll be out of town  
Baby, before the sun goes down  
There's an agent and he's made a bet  
That I'll be sitting on a jumbo jet  
Baby, I'd like to stay here  
Baby, I'd like to play here  
But I made a deal  
And though it don't seem real  
Just another day  
I'll be three thousand miles away  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll  
  
You know, tomorrow I'll be on my way  
Flying through an other day  
Places turn into a dream  
I can't remember where I've been  
Baby, I'd like to stop here  
Baby, I'd like to drop here  
But in a month or so  
Then I will have to go  
But it does no good  
Still it's in my blood  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll  
  
Man must do what a man must do  
No time to sit and wait  
One day he's gonna realize  
That it is too late  
  
You know, tomorrow I'll be on my own  
Flying through an other zone  
Faces turn into a dream  
I can't remember who I've seen  
Baby, I'd like to lay here  
Baby, I'd like to stay here  
But there's an other show  
And I just have to go  
Still keep coming through  
Don't know how I'll do  
I got to pay my dues  
You know I sing the blues  
Got to do my thing  
All I do is sing rock and roll

It's a cold and winter's night and the rain is falling down  
It's so cold, cold outside, snow is laying all around  
There is blackness in my window, and the silence is the only sound  
  
Well I'm sitting and I'm thinking though I like to watch T.V.  
It just fills my head with garbage that my eyes ain't supposed to see  
Got the turned off T.V. blues now, but I'm lonely as you see  
  
Well I've got a worried feeling, all the pain and misery  
Well, it's happening in the world now, even though I cannot see  
Though my body is now with you, still my mind is running free  
  
There's just nothing I can do now, though I search from day to day  
But the truth is so hard to tell you, and you know it, anyway  
It's a cold and winter's evening, I wish my blues would go away

I've been working on the road about fifteen years  
Been blowing my mind, I've been blasting my ears  
Don't you know, babe?  
I've been sleeping all day and working all night  
I made a lot of money, but it don't feel right  
Don't you know, babe?  
  
Well, I've seen the world and it's seen me  
In a strange kind of way I guess I'm free  
Don't you know, babe?  
Well, I've seen it bad and I've seen it good  
But, now, I want to clear my blood  
Don't you know, babe?  
  
I've got a feeling for home  
Somewhere that I call my own  
  
Well, I tried to live the way I should  
I've shed some tears and sweated blood  
Don't you know, babe?  
And I think it's time I took a break  
'Cause I have took all I can take  
Don't you know, babe?  
  
I've got a feeling for home  
Somewhere that I call my own  
Take me home, babe

They took me down the grading station  
And they classified me zed  
'Cause of over population  
They told me that I would soon be dead  
  
But I slipped out of the force field  
And hid beneath the monorail  
But the automatic blood hounds  
Lord, they're soon hot along my trail  
  
Now if I had been a scholar  
With computer working hard  
Then my molecular structure  
Would not be on the grader's card  
  
So, I know that they will get me  
Put my index in the brain  
Then, the atoms of my body  
Will be disposed of, Lordy, down the drain  
  
They took me down the grading station  
And they classified me zed  
'Cause of over population  
They told me that I would soon be dead

You can't win them all  
'Cause sometimes you fall flat on your face on the floor  
You can't win them all  
It's no good at all if you feel that your life is a bore  
  
You've got to hang loose to keep from the noose  
And you've got to learn to use your brain  
You've got to live right and keep to the right  
Then, you're free if you don't go insane  
  
I've seen a lot of people  
They've all blown it out  
You can't win them all is what they all shout  
You've got to keep tryin'  
Got to stand up a gain  
You can't lose them all, babe  
'Cause one day you'll win  
  
You've got to have taste or life is a waste  
And you don't ever tune yourself in  
You've got to keep on or they'll get you, my son  
And they know that you just can't win

You give me loving that I can't return  
You give me money that you know I'll burn  
I'll give you something that you can't give back  
Then, I'm moving right on down the track  
You've given everything you've got to me  
But, still you cannot really set me free  
My life is changing and I'm on the run  
I'll see you later when I've had some fun  
  
I keep running, 'cause I know the score  
You'll never find me coming back for more  
I'll catch you later 'cause I'm gonna split  
You give a lot, I only need a bit  
You give me loving that I can't return  
You give me money that you know I'll burn  
You give me loving just for your own sake  
You only give it so that you can take  
  
You give me loving and it's plain to see  
You want to give it to me all for free  
But, I can't take it 'cause you need it back  
The art of giving is the one I lack  
You give me loving and you drive me mad  
You give me money and it makes me sad  
'Cause I meed freedom more than I need gold  
And so I'll leave before I get too old
