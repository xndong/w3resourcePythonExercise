Empty bottle was half empty, tide was low, and I was thirsty  
I saw her sitting at the bar, well you know how some girls are  
Always making eyes, well she wasn't making eyes  
So I sidled up beside her, settled down and shouted, "Hi there"  
My name's Stewart Ransom Miller, I'm a serial lady-killer"  
She said, "I'm already dead," that's exactly what she said  
So we tripped the lights fantastic, we was both made of elastic  
Midnight came and midnight went and I though I was the President  
She said, "Do you have a car?" and I said, "Do I have a car?"  
What's so great about the Barrier Reef?  
What's so fine about art?  
What's so good about a Good Times Van  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man, yeah  
My heart wasn't in it, not for one single minute  
Oh then I went through the motions with her  
Her on top, and me on liquor, didn't do no good, well I didn't think it would  
What's so great about the Barrier Reef?  
What's so fine about art?  
What's so good about a Good Times Van  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man?  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man?  
When you're working on a broken, working on a broken  
Working on a broken man?  

I've been lightin' matches in the boiler room  
Wearing sulfur perfume, don't I smell nice?  
You come sniffin' around just like you own the joint  
You know it's rude to point, don't make me tell you twice  
Well, I like the way you walk, that's why I left my door unlocked  
I must be going off half-cocked, I sometimes do  
You think it's funny but I know it ain't no joke  
There's nothing left to read in here, there's nothing left to smoke  
Before the band kicks in, the getting better start  
I'll stomp a mud hole in your heart  
You poured whiskey in my Slurpee, swear to God you got me drunk  
Now, I'm thinking that I'm sunk and I can't swim  
I'm drowning in the back seat of a '61 Bel Air  
I got a mouthful of your hair, a handful of skin  
I ain't suffocating, I'm just sick and tired of waiting  
Stop this pointless hesitating, pull me in  
There's an awful lot of stars out here, an awful lot of sky  
I'm turning on the radio, they're playing 'Ready to ride'  
Before the band kicks in, the getting better start  
I'll stomp a mud hole in your heart  
We could cruise the lake like psychos  
Scare the kids on motorcycles, there ain't nothing I would rather do  
It's 3-D on the TV but it's empty on the street  
If it weren't for me and you, the avenue would be incomplete  
And I should say this before this whole thing even starts  
I'll stomp a mud hole in your heart  

Big brown eyes and a gust of wind  
And the cherry burns the corner of the page that says  
"The end is coming soon", but not soon enough  
Restring all your guitars, pack up all your stuff  
'Cause if Robert's dad is right  
We might not make it through the night  
And I'd hate to go alone  
Please pick up the phone  
Well, a box of red and a pill or three  
And I'm calling time and temperature just for some company  
I wish you were here, I wish I was too  
I'll drink myself to sleeplessness, I always do  
You don't want me anymore  
Since fame and fortune broke down our door  
You don't give me no respect  
What did I expect?  
If that phone don't ring one more time  
I'm gonna lose what's left of my mind  
You made a big impression for a girl of your size  
Now I can't get by without you and your big brown eyes  
Her hands are cold, her breath is warm  
She's a port in a storm  
I'm worried now but it won't be long  
It takes a worried man, you know, to sing a worried song  
I've got issues, yeah  
Like I miss you, yeah  
And I wish I weren't so thick  
I'm making myself sick  
If that phone don't ring one more time  
I'm gonna lose what's left of my mind  
You made a big impression for a girl of your size  
Now I can't get by without you and your big brown eyes  

I left you last night on the left coast  
I'm writin' you a letter right now  
The things that you do are rendering you  
Something I can't live without  
Maybe maybe I've got a pulse now  
Maybe my heart's on fire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Left you last night on the left side  
The land of the free to be burned  
Well the heat of your touch is makin' it such  
That I've forgotten everything I've learned  
Maybe maybe I've got a problem  
Maybe my heart's a liar  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Yeah a bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
Left you last night on the left half  
Of the bed, the half that used to be mine  
The way that you sleep is the image I'll keep  
Always on the edge of my mind  
Maybe maybe I've got a reason  
For livin' even though I'm so tired  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
Yeah a bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
And I may be a bird in a cage  
But it least it's your cage  
Maybe maybe you are the only  
One my heart's desired  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  
A bird in the hand is worth a bird in a cage  
Is worth a bird on a telephone wire  

These storms they gather forces unbeknownst to fools like me  
They hide on the horizon too far gone to see  
I could have swore the heart you wore upon your sleeve was mine  
I could not see in front of me you were leaving I was blind  
Blinding sheets of rain that's what I'm blaming  
I must have been blind not to see that you would leave  
Now you are gone and the world is an ugly place  
And I pray good Lord send more blinding sheets of rain  
I love you, lost it's meaning to shipwrecked fools like me  
The rain is never ending there's no ships out to see  
We have not seen a good night since these thunderstorms rolled in  
I pray God please send them back and make me blind again  
Blinding sheets of rain that's what I'm blaming  
I must have been blind not to see that you would leave  
Now you are gone and the world is an ugly place  
And I pray good Lord send more blinding sheets of rain  
And I pray good Lord send more blinding sheets of rain  
And I pray good Lord send more blinding sheets of rain  

She drove a blue car around Bloomington  
She was a thin girl but she had substance  
She said that most girls who come to Bloomington  
Only come here to find husbands  
The existence of God was confirmed  
By the way she unfolded herself alongside  
And I tried to harden my heart  
But she wouldn't let me, she wouldn't let me  
Oh oh Bloomington, Bloomington  
When the rest of the world is over and done  
Oh oh you'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington  
In a park that doubled as a parking lot  
There was music it was free  
Oh the girl in pink took a sip of my drink  
And laid down next to me  
Yeah the way she unfolded herself  
Was an earthquake a hurricane tidal wave flood  
This is love baby this is love  
The moment she let me, the moment she let me  
Oh Bloomington, Bloomington  
When the rest of the world is over and done  
Oh oh you'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington  
She drove a blue car around Bloomington  
She was a thin girl but she had substance  
She said that most girls who come to Bloomington  
Only come here to find husbands  
Bloomington, Bloomington  
When the rest of the world is over and done  
Oh oh you'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington  
She drove a blue car around Bloomington  
She was a thin girl but she had substance  
She said that most girls who come to Bloomington  
Only come here to find husbands  
Bloomington, Bloomington  
When the rest of the world is over and done  
Oh oh you'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington  
Bloomington, Bloomington  
When the rest of the world is over and done  
You'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington  
You'll still be the only one  
I'll ever love Bloomington  

Rowboat lightning I kissed her yeah it didn't mean a thing  
Seems like years ago it was yesterday  
Fire drill yell freeze don't hang around long face disease  
I got a book of poems that's gonna set you free  
Well it's bad luck and it's a hard luck story  
And I'm sorry I ain't sticking around  
I got a real bad feeling that a book of poems ain't enough  
Well it's a sick world and sixteen days  
I got nightmares every night  
I got a real bad feeling that a book of poems ain't enough  
Hardcore uptown not the kind of place you wanna settle down  
I only walked her home but that was bad enough  
Two trains yell freeze it was a head-on cold now it's a love disease  
I got a book of poems you gotta see to believe

The hat on your head the ghosts before breakfast  
The lump in your throat the name on her necklace  
She's certain she'll never be caught  
You can buy her things now but she'll never be bought  
The cat on her mind the ring in her tan-line  
The lowering lids the perfume is white wine  
She's certain her karma is good  
Glass houses won't burn but you know this would  
So take her inside she's your borrowed bride  
And you'll never guess how much she has not cried  
Life comes apart at the seams it seems  
Life comes apart at the seams  
It rings only once when you sit down to dinner  
You knew all was lost when she named you the winner  
You are certain of nothing at all  
Except that it's late but it's not the last call  
So take her inside she's your borrowed bride  
And you'll never guess how much she has not cried  
Life comes apart at the seams it seems  
Life comes apart at the seams it seems  
Life comes apart  

In a hotel room just off Times Square it's like a closet  
I can watch the dancing class go round  
But in a hotel room that costs as much as my apartment  
I can watch the working class go down  
And it's enough to make a crooked man go straight  
Broadway, Broadway  
In a hotel room just off Times Square they made a monster  
He was unaware of what went down  
Fattening him up just like calf before a slaughter  
But he'd had his fill of hollow town  
And it's enough to make a stupid man think straight  
Broadway, Broadway  
And it's enough to make a crooked man go straight  
Broadway, Broadway, Broadway, Broadway  

You're gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
You'll regret the things that you done  
One of these days you're gonna rue  
All the messed up things you do  
You're gonna die the way you live  
And the way you drink you're like a river  
Bound for falls and not much fun  
You're gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
You're gonna wake up in your shoes  
No one you love, watching you  
You'll hate you're face when the morning shines  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind, go  
You're gonna crash on the barrelhead son  
And do the walls know what you done?  
And do they listen in on you?  
Do the walls know what you do?  
You're gonna wake up in your shoes  
No one you love, watching you  
You'll hate you're face when the morning shines  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind  
On the mirror frame and your guilty mind  

Cryin', cryin'  
Cryin' drunk  
Walker lives on the island  
I'm still stuck in the south  
Walker lives off his hands now  
I still live off my mouth  
The only difference is you've got integrity, I don't  
Only difference is I'll do a lot of things you won't  
You'd like to think I'm sleeping very peacefully, I'm not  
I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin'  
Walker says you're a Cancer  
I just think you're a flu  
Oh, but then again I'm a Virgo  
I'm no match for you  
Yeah, the only difference is that I pretend that it's alright  
So cut up pretendin' I can make it through the night  
You'd like to think I'm sleeping very peacefully, I'm not  
I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk  
I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin', I'm cryin' drunk  
The only difference is you've got integrity, I don't  
Only difference is I'll do a lot of things you won't  
You'd like to think I'm sleeping very peacefully, I'm not  
I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk, I'm cryin' drunk  
I'm cryin'  

In a western town, beneath the northern lights,  
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night,  
You believe in cards and you believe in signs  
And I'll be leavin' soon, but I'm here tonight  
  
On a mountainside, well below the stars  
Keep your lovers eyes in mason jars  
And I should be scared but I feel no fear  
Cause I'll be leavin' soon, tonight I'm here  
  
And even if you are the one  
And even if the cards are all true  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
  
Well the southern pea moved her family down  
Then along came me to her sleepy town  
I don't believe in cards, I don't believe in signs  
But I'll be leavin' soon. I'm here tonight  
  
And even if you are the one, and even if I tried to be true  
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls, oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
  
In a western town, beneath the northern lights  
Where the pine trees pine for the fall of night  
Don't believe in me, did I make that clear?  
Cause I'll be long gone soon, but tonight I'm here  
  
And even if you were the one  
I didn't wanna walk out on you  
But when the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?  
When the curtain calls  
Oh baby, what's a boy to do?

Underneath the foreign stars  
In a foreign place where they don't love you  
I do care,  
In the pale moonlight  
Your eyes are wide  
And the band plays...  
Everybody wants you  
  
And he takes your hand tenderly  
And he whispers  
Sweet surrender, nothing  
How he feels about girls like you  
Your flip flop smiles,  
And your big blue eyes  
On vacation  
  
[Chorus]  
Dance with me into the ocean  
Roll with me into the sea  
Don't tell me the world is in trouble  
  
Do you want to dance with me?  
  
Go, changes hands as the big waves  
Crash and dream don't die  
But I do  
Where were you when I needed you  
Right now  
The telephone just rings,  
I'm gonna find you...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you want to dance with me, oh  
Do you want to dance with me?  
  
Underneath the foreign sun  
With a foreign man who is gone and almost forgotten  
Take everything you see  
And remember us and wonder,  
If you will be forgiven...  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't tell me the world is in trouble  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do you want to dance with me  
Do you want to dance with me, oh  
Do you want to dance with me?

When I first met Doreen  
She was barely seventeen  
She was drinking whiskey sours in the bar  
The way she tossed 'em back  
I would've had a heart attack  
But as it is I let her drive my car  
We galloped through the boroughs  
Like a pair of horny thoroughbreds  
Until I said, "Stop the car, Doreen"  
Well, you can roll your eyes and nod  
But I swear that I saw God in the moonlight  
On a side street in the wreckage we call Queens  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean, Doreen, come clean, Doreen  
Well, I'm pulling into Cleveland  
In a seven-seater tour van  
There's eight of us, so I'm sleeping on the floor  
The guy that plays the banjo  
Keeps on handing me the old crow  
Which multiplies my sorrow, I can't take it anymore  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean Doreen, come clean, Doreen  
Now I'm begging and I'm pleading  
"Well pull over guys, I'm bleeding  
There's a fina off the highway with a phone"  
I'm calling you, Doreen  
But it rings and rings and rings  
Where is it that you are, if you aren't in our bed at home  
Doreen, Doreen, last night, I had an awful dream  
You were laying in the arms of a man I'd never seen  
Come clean, Doreen, come clean, Doreen  

I've been reading books when no one's lookin'  
I've been listenin' to the sirens in the night  
Robert says, "I'm goin' straight to hell, yeah"  
If I hang around here I just might  
And I'd like to take some medicine  
And like to drink some wine  
I'd like to wake up numb like all my friends  
There's a road to where I came from  
It gets longer all the time  
There's a road to where I'm goin'  
It never ends  
And my moon, it always sways  
And my guitar always plays and plays  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
I've been writing fairy tales on postcards  
Writing down the story of my life  
Carrie says, "I make everything so hard"  
Carrie says, "I'm difficult, she's right"  
And I'd like to take some medicine  
I'd like to take you home  
I'd like to get that woman off my mind  
Well I like your pouty lips  
I like your pert little bones  
But I'm sleeping with the porcelain tonight  
And my cloud, it always rains  
Ken's feedback always fades  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  
Drowning in the days  

I got a four leaf clover  
And it ain't done one single lick of good  
I'm still a drunk I'm still a loser  
Living in a lousy neighborhood  
  
I got a real live horseshoe  
And I hung it upside down above my door  
But it ain't done nothing to attract you  
So I don't know what the hell it's for  
  
Why don't you come over  
I'll show you my four leaf clover  
Who am I tryin' to kid  
I'm not the kind of guy you'd go for  
  
I got a four leaf clover  
But I ain't got no hope of getting you  
  
I gotta oooooooooo  
Oh I got a lucky silver dollar  
My granddaddy gave it to me now he's dead  
At times like this I wish that I could join him  
So I can stop this pounding in my head  
  
Why don't you come over  
I'll show you my four leaf clover  
Who am I tryin' to kid  
I'm not the kind of guy you go for  
  
I got a four leaf clover  
But I ain't got no hope of getting you  
Well I ain't got no hope of getting you  
No I ain't got no hope of getting you

I was a debater  
Was not a stoner nor an inline skater  
Was not a player nor a player hater  
I was just a bookworm on a respirator  
Who's to say that's wrong  
I was in the chess club  
Didn't have a swimming pool much less a true love  
Didn't have a dalliance much less a hot tub  
I was just a brain whose brain never let up  
Who's to say that's wrong  
The twelve years after five  
Are years we're lucky to survive  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away  
Went out for the football team  
Found out the hard way that you can't live your Dad's dream  
Had pretty thin skin to be in the machine  
Then I found a guitar and the rest's a fanzine  
Who's to say that's wrong  
The moral of the song  
Is that the high school kids are wrong  
You know they have been all along  
Come graduation day you'll be gone  
Hang in there friends forever  
In memory far away

Outside St. Ignatius, outside of the law  
You walk by so gracefully, I just stand in awe  
You're a goddess, you're the hottest oddity I've found  
We can go swimmin' in our skin and hope that we don't drown  
I could save the water just by drinking it tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
Tanked up out on Elm Street, looking for a ride  
Stretched out on concrete, running out of pride  
You need help dear, and I'm sincere, let me be the one  
I'm not a big star but I've got a big car, you're too weak to run  
You could save the highway if you'd crash with me tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I could save the water just by drinking it tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
Someday when we're older, deep in loneliness  
Things we said today won't matter, no one could care less  
We're just shadows, just ask Plato, it was all a dream  
I've had it with Dallas, let's burn down the Palace, I'll bring the kerosene  
I could save this song if I'd just sing real loud tonight  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  
I can't find the words to make it right, to make it right  

Well I must have been stoned when this whole started,  
'Cause I just can't seem to think straight anymore.  
  
Can't figure out where I'm at, maybe Memphis, maybe Mexico.  
I think you're swell but I ain't gonna tell you so.  
I think you're great but it's late and I'd better go.  
  
Hitchhike to Rhome. Take the Greyhound to Fredericksburg.  
Well I'm flat broke, I've been smoking butts for days.  
  
You say,

I've been down, I've been down too far to care  
I keep getting in my car but I'm not going anywhere  
And I've been had, well at least that's how it looks  
And it's not funny like on TV and it's not smart like it is in books  
And I wonder, yeah, I wonder how the world keeps spinnin' around  
Where's a boy with bad intentions gonna settle down?  
And I don't know what you've been told  
The streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
I recall, when I was twenty-three  
Wondering how anyone could fall in love with me  
But now I'm old, hell, I'm well past twenty-five  
And I can't seem to fall in love no matter how I try  
And I wonder where I'll wind up but I'm headed west I know  
Wind my way through Texas and into New Mexico  
And I don't know what you've been told  
The streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
And I don't know what you've been told  
The streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  
Yeah, the streets of where I'm from are paved with hearts instead of gold  

The new kid he's got money  
The money I deserve  
I should be rolling in it  
I've been a working stiff  
As for the justice  
No one knows where it went  
  
I'm gonna toil away  
Until my judgment day  
I will be rewarded for the good things I did  
Believe me every year  
There is another one here  
Don't you see I used to be the new kid?  
I am sorry to say, you'll get carried away  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
I'll tell you again  
Don't get too settled in  
You will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
  
the new kid he's got my girl  
The girl I used to have  
He's got the looks  
You know, got them from his dad  
I should be kissin' that girl  
We should be so in love  
There is no justice  
There's just dark stars above  
  
I'm gonna toil away  
Until my judgment day  
I will be rewarded for the good things I did  
Believe me every year, there is another one here  
Don't you see I used to be the new kid?  
Believe me every year  
There is another one here  
Don't you see I used to be the new kid?  
I am sorry to say  
You'll get carried away  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
I'll tell you again  
Don't get too settled in  
Oh you will be replaced  
You will be replaced  
By the new kid  
By the new kid  
By the new kid  
By the new kid

One old brown shoe falls in slow motion  
And the bedsprings hover right above your head  
As bed springs do, when you're beneath them  
Someone else just climbed into your bed  
By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix  
She'd arranged for your shoes to be filled  
Well, you've got your pride and a blue-steel '45  
Waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall  
Dig a double grave out in the meadow  
And you'll curse the rain that turns the dirt to mud  
You'll take 35 south towards Laredo  
And you'll try to find a doctor that'll prescribe an elixir  
That'll make everything better except your late wife and her lover  
By the time she thought you'd probably got to Phoenix  
She'd sealed her fate and gotten herself killed  
You've got your pride and a blue-steel '45  
Waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall  
And you waited for the other shoe to fall  

I got a time bomb, in my mind, Mom  
I hear it ticking but I don't know why  
I call the police but they don't like me  
I hear 'em whispering when I walk by  
  
I got a land mine in my bloodline  
I'm not immune to getting blown apart  
She's like a claymore, that's what she's there for  
She's waiting 'round here to get blown apart  
  
Having her on my brain's like getting hit by a train  
She's gonna kill me, oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
Oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
  
I got a time bomb, in my mind, Mom  
It's gonna go off but I don't know when  
I need a doctor to extract her  
I got a feeling she'd get right back in again  
  
I got a time bomb, in my mind, Mom  
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl  
She's gonna kill me and I don't mean softly  
I got it badly for a stick-legged girl  
  
Having her on my brain's, getting hit by a train  
She's gonna kill me, oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
Oh, Celeste, oh, Celeste  
  
Oh, Celeste

You're a bottle cap away  
From pushing me too far  
Well the problem's gettin' big  
An empty compact car  
So I won't feel so bad  
I did all I could do  
Now I'm on wounded knee  
And we're at Waterloo  
So please get out of my car  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was "I won't be home no more"  
  
You're a rattle trap tonight  
My ears are gettin' tired  
So listen for awhile  
Before this thing expired  
Oh it was bound to fail  
All because of where I'm from  
Now the moon's at four o'clock  
And it's high time kingdom come  
So please get out, of my car  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was "I won't be home no more"  
  
I was born in the backseat of a mustang  
On a cold night in a hard rain  
And the very first song that the radio sang  
Was "I won't be home no more"

You belong to my heart  
Now and forever  
Though our love had it's start  
Not long ago  
  
Well we were gathering stars  
And a million guitars  
Played our love song  
  
When I said I love you  
Every beat of my heart  
Said it too  
  
Was a moment like this  
When I first found you  
And your eyes threw a kiss  
When they met mine  
  
Now we own all the stars  
And a million guitars  
Are still playing  
  
Now you are a song  
And you'll always belong  
To my heart  
  
Now you are a song  
And you'll always belong  
To my heart
