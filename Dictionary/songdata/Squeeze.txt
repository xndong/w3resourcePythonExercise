She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
Her life was changed in an instant  
The van was filled up  
And tied to the rack  
Her home that now seemed so distant  
Kissing goodbye  
To her friends on the stairs  
She felt a loss deep within her  
Sat in the front seat with stuff everywhere  
The neighbours said they would ring her  
They moved to the sea front  
And loved their new view  
Of tides coming in on the shingle  
She and her daughter  
Found new things to do  
At last it was good to be single  
And in the summer  
The place came alive  
Lights on the pier in the evening  
The fresh sea air  
And could cut with a knife  
Such a wonderful feeling  
  
She worked in a pub  
Where bands would appear  
On a tiny stage in the corner  
She watched them load in  
With tattered old gear  
The place would get like a sauna  
London had gone now  
Her new life was strong  
She found herself a new karma  
She fell for a man  
Who played with a band  
And took her life from it's drama  
  
She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
The past was neatly extinguished  
He was much younger  
But she lived with that  
He struggled hard with his english  
She felt his loving  
And proudly reclaimed  
All of the warmth she'd been lacking  
They lay in bed  
Looking out at the rain  
No more moving or packing  
  
She moved from Clapham  
And didn't look back  
Her life had changed in an instant

She goes for her medical  
She's passed, its' a miracle  
She's up over the moon  
She whistles nonsense tunes  
She wants drinks for everyone  
She's found a chord that she can strum  
Emotions peaking out  
Her paints all over town.  
  
[Chorus]  
What's that she's playing?  
Annie get your gun  
What's that she's taking  
The song has to be sung  
She's gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
That's unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Don't pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Don't shoot that singer  
You're shooting number one, number one  
  
He's not into miracles  
Sees life all to cynical  
The cat has got his tongue  
Now she bangs on his drum  
He says pull the other one  
Bells ring, look what you have done  
Emotions leaking out  
Her paints all over town.  
  
What's that she's playing?  
Annie get your gun  
What's that she's taking  
The song has to be sung  
She's gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
That's unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Don't pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Don't shoot that singer  
You're shooting number one  
  
Get your gun  
Get your gun  
She's gone electric  
Annie wipe them out  
That's unexpected  
Strum that thing and shout  
Don't pull that trigger  
Annie get your gun  
Don't shoot that singer  
Annie, Annie, Annie, Annie

I can't stop my heart from beating beating  
Bang bang bang bang (bang bang bang bang)  
I would like to be like peter peter  
Pan pan pan pan (bang bang bang bang)  
  
[Chorus]  
Staying younger by the day  
My good looks will never fade  
I hope i can can can can  
(bang bang bang bang)  
  
Napoleon was very brave  
Incomplete he took to his grave  
Josephine was such a joke  
Kept her letter inside his coat  
  
V. van gogh was so i hear  
One to send his love an ear  
Some impression this would make  
This was to be his big mistake  
  
Catherine lost her pretty head  
She wasn't very good in bed  
Didn't wear a hat again  
She got so wet out in the rain  
  
I can't stop my heart from beating beating  
Bang bang bang bang (bang bang bang bang)  
I would like to be like peter peter  
Pan pan pan pan (bang bang bang bang)  
  
[Chorus]  
[Chorus]  
Can can can can (bang bang bang bang)

The liberator of sin  
The giver of delight  
I took the drug  
And went out like a light  
I giggled on the bed  
As I stared at the wall  
I was the one who felt ever so small  
I couldn't take it  
I couldn't win with my thoughts  
Forever playing chess  
And keeping reports  
On whatever I saw  
And whatever moved  
I was emperor for an hour  
I had nothing else to do  
  
The universe caved in  
My legs fell away  
I took the drug but you didn't say  
That I would be you and you would be me  
When I took the pill  
That put me to sleep  
I couldn't take it  
I couldn't spin all the plates  
Forever in a mind field of personal games  
What could I do  
I was Caesar of Rome  
Thank God I woke up  
To find you had come home

There's a stain on my notebook  
Where your coffee cup was  
And there's ash in the pages  
Now I've got myself lost  
I was writing to tell you  
That my feelings tonight  
Are a stain on my notebook  
That rings your goodbye  
With the way that you left me  
I can hardly contain  
The hurt and the anger  
And the joy of the pain  
Now knowing I am single  
They'll be fire in my eyes  
And a stain on my notebook  
For a new love tonight  
From the lips without passion  
To the lips with a kiss  
There's nothing of your love  
That I'll ever miss  
The stain on my notebook  
Remain all that's left  
Of the memory of late nights  
And coffee in bed  
Now she's gone  
And I'm back on the beat  
A stain on my notebook  
Says nothing to me  
Now she's gone  
And I'm out with a friend  
With lips full of passion  
And coffee in bed

Sherman Tanks and Tommy Guns,  
Telegrams and Hot Cross Buns,  
See the Gerries on the run,  
Battleships well here I come,  
Commando raid in bed tonight,  
Under the covers with torch light.  
(chorus)  
Rat-a-tat tat Rat-a-tat tat,  
Out of the trench into combat,  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts,  
Turning the page for more blood and guts  
  
Kamicaze crashes plane,  
Shits himself but all in vain,  
Fix the mine under the tray,  
And get away in time again,  
The cap-I-tan is on the bridge,  
Pulls the pin from his sandwich.  
  
Rat-a-tat tat Rat-a-tat tat,  
Out of the trench into combat,  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts,  
Turning the page for more blood and guts.  
  
Prison camps and sorry sarge,  
Biting harder than his bark,  
Got a bullet in his arm,  
Pulled it out and took em' on,  
Commando raid in bed tonight,  
Under the cover with torch light.  
  
Rat-a-tat tat Rat-a-tat tat,  
Out of the trench into combat,  
Covered in bruises covered in cuts,  
Turning the page for more blood and guts,  
More blood and guts,  
More blood and guts,  
More blood and guts.  
  

I know that I'm bonkers  
Stupidity conquers  
Forgive me I know not what I do  
The cunning behavior  
Takes up every acre  
Of emotional cage in the zoo  
You know how it goes  
The volcano blows  
Eruptions hold the duvet down  
The words on the lips  
The sticking out ribs  
As I try to push my weight around  
  
I'm sorry please witness  
This act of forgiveness  
It's all I can do for her to see  
That I was the sad case  
A mouse in the rat race  
Won't somebody pass me the cheese  
  
The size of her breasts  
Like woodpeckers nests  
Would comfort me on winter nights  
The brains in my pants  
Create milli amps  
Of pleasure with seconds of delight  
  
I'm bonkers believe me  
A Federico Fellini  
I'm swinging on the windmills of my mind  
Where I have been ground down  
I'm still walking down town  
I'm leaving all this madness behind  
  
Laid back on the couch  
With me the old slouch  
For an Oscar on the silent screen  
There's no time to waste  
As I fill my fat face  
With a pizza slice and custard cream  
  
I'm sorry I hurt you  
I'm bonkers believe me

When you're down and you're lonely  
Come to me I'll be your only  
Always remember  
I'll be by your side  
Call me up daytime or night  
I'll always listen every time  
If you need me  
Then please believe me, don't you cry  
  
I'll show concern  
And I'll keep my word  
I won't stay away  
Now and then when your heart's in pain  
I'd like to say  
Always remember  
I'll be forever  
By your side  
  
Friends like this  
Are hard to find  
With time to talk  
And to confide  
If you need me  
Please believe me  
I'm by your side  
  
The secrets kept as we lie in bed  
I can't keep away  
Now and then when your heart's in pain  
I'd like to say  
Always remember  
I'll be forever  
By your side

She was married and then divorced  
Things seemed to happen that way  
The children were confused, sometimes they'd fight  
Sitting in their toys and games  
To them she's mother and I am their friend  
Who sits with them on his lap  
And sleeps on the sofa on alternate weekends  
No substitute for their dad  
She's a very good mum  
As she tries to explain  
Everything that she can  
But a child's mind is sharp  
They imagine the worst  
Sometimes can't understand  
That there's so much to learn  
When you open a can of worms  
  
So to the park to play on the swings  
To give their mother a break  
When I saw their father walking down the path  
Heading down towards the gate  
I froze on the spot, heart in my throat  
I hoped he'd not see us there  
He soon disappeared and the kids on the slide  
Were happy and unaware  
  
I read the papers and made scrambled eggs  
The kids got ready to leave  
Their father was taking them for the weekend  
With pocket money and sweets  
They were excited as they waved goodbye  
And I went straight back to bed  
Their mother stood and watched as they drove away  
Standing on the front door step

Mary and Joseph drove into town,  
Searching for a place to stay.  
The moon was up, and his foot was down  
A miracle was on its way.  
  
They tried the hotels, the motels, the bed-and-breakfast  
Locals, but no one seemed to have any room.  
  
Better find a double room soon!  
  
[Chorus]  
So where would Christmas be without  
Mary and Joseph?  
Walk of the Wise?  
Laurel and holly?  
Cracker Surprise?  
Lights on the pine tree?  
And more aftershave?  
I'm not forgetting Jesus who was born on Christmas Day!  
  
They found a place with the neon lights  
TV, Pool, and Vacancies  
The man at the desk didn't hear them right  
When the two of them booked for three.  
  
They watched the TV  
And deeply, she thought about the needing  
Of the heavens to deliver this way  
And it happened on Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
Christmas Day  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mary and Joseph were so surprised  
With admirers around the crib  
There was something in their son's eyes  
They identically took one in.  
  
Like a Messiah, and a Fire  
Like the tread around a tire  
That grip all roads  
It's to bond you there.  
  
And it happened on Christmas Day!  
Christmas day.  
Christmas day.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
"Not forgetting Jesus."

The cigarette of a single man  
Burns in the ashtray by his bed  
He pulls the ring of another can  
And holds it up beside his head  
The book he reads is on the floor  
He's read it several times before  
What you got to go home to?  
  
The cigarette of a single man  
Sits in the ashtray on the bar  
He sits and sifts through several plans  
But knows alone he won't go far  
He needs the love another has  
To help him, if another can  
  
The cigarette of a single man  
Lays in the gutter by his side  
Now he's one of those little lambs  
Who strayed too far from the flock to find  
He's better off without the grief  
That people wear between their teeth  
  
And in his mouth as he's asleep  
The cigarette of a single man

My head was stuck in the cat flap on the door  
Where I could see her walking on the kitchen floor  
Down on my knees  
Just like a dog  
Begging for scraps that she said she hadn't got  
She took her pen she poked me in the eye  
As through the lock I looked to see my world inside  
I kicked and swore  
Void of all brain  
I couldn't see that I was the one to blame  
  
Cold shoulder  
Like a slaughtered cow in a butcher's fridge  
Cold shoulder  
She had laid the plans where we built our bridge  
To a better life  
Cold shoulder  
  
I had been chased by a hairbrush that she threw  
Life was blurred when the hand of fate came into view  
It smacked my face  
I was released  
I came back home where life became a feast  
  
Cold shoulder  
Like a slaughtered cow in a butcher's fridge  
Cold shoulder  
She had laid the plans where we built our bridge  
To a better life  
Cold shoulder  
Then I fell over  
Into a bush

The Indians send signals  
From the rocks above the pass  
The cowboys take positions  
In the bushes and the grass  
  
The squaw is with the corporal  
She is tied against the tree  
She doesn't mind the language  
It's the beating she don't need  
  
She lets loose all the horses  
When the corporal is asleep  
And he wakes to find the fire's dead  
And arrows in his hat  
  
And davy crockett rides around  
And says it's cool for cats  
The sweeney's doing ninety  
'Cause they've got the word to go  
  
They get a gang of villains  
In a shed up at heathrow  
They're counting out the fivers  
When the handcuffs lock again  
  
In and out of wandsworth  
With the numbers on their names  
It's funny how their missus'  
Always look the bleeding same  
  
And meanwhile at the station  
There's a couple of likely lads  
Who swear like how's your father  
And they're very cool for cats  
They're cool for cats  
  
To change the mood a little  
I've been posing down the pub  
On seeing my reflection  
I'm looking slightly rough  
  
I fancy this, I fancy that  
I want to be so flash  
I give a little muscle  
And I spend a little cash  
  
But all I get is bitter and a nasty little rash  
And by the time I'm sober  
I've forgotten what I've had  
And everybody tells me that it's cool to be a cat  
Cool for cats  
  
Shake up at the disco  
And I think I've got a pull  
I ask her lots of questions  
And she hangs on to the wall  
  
I kiss her for the first time  
And then I take her home  
I'm invited in for coffee  
And I give the dog a bone  
  
She likes to go to discos  
But she's never on her own  
I said I'll see you later  
And I give her some old chat  
  
But it's not like that on the T.V.  
When it's cool for cats  
It's cool for cats

He stalks the club with cupid's toy  
Foremost in his mind  
Jacks his body into shape  
And leaves the rest behind  
He has a pea for a brain  
A spud for a heart  
A scar on his cheek  
And a rubber duck in his bath  
This boy doesn't give love  
This boy doesn't get love  
  
He stalks the club with eagle eyes  
Springing on his heels  
Likes to throw a hand of dice  
Then hang them in his wheels  
He has a crease in his jeans  
A frown on his face  
The scent of a man  
Who thinks he has taste  
  
She smiles as he buys her a drink  
Standing at the end of the bar  
He feels helpless when she looks in his eyes  
Suddenly there's love in his heart  
  
He stalks the club with such a smile  
Forever on the move  
He takes pride in looking smart  
And knowing when to groove  
He has a heart on a chain  
His picture inside  
A ring in one ear  
Dark glasses at night

When I was crowned a mummy's boy by friends I didn't like  
I made a meal of trips to school upon my father's bike  
I used to sit between his legs, perched on a piece of wood  
If it ever rained on us, I'd slip beneath his hood  
And at home the radio was on  
From Julie Andrews to Jerry Garcia  
Life was all fun and games  
I was out of my head and underneath my bed  
Playing with electric trains  
  
At home the stereo was on  
My head was filled with rock  
I played a willow cricket bat guitar  
And soloed round the clock  
My records stacked up in a pile  
Collected from the charts  
And Top of the Pops  
  
Kneeling with torchlight shining  
Before me in my bed  
My eyeballs stuck in readers wives  
Pubic hairs proudly counted everyday  
Manhood took me slowly  
Out into the milky way  
  
I chased the girls and made them cry  
My hair grew down my back  
The passing of my teenage years  
Were spent down in the sack  
I played guitar and formed a band  
I puked up all night long  
  
As people came to sit and stare  
While I raced through my songs  
The sound of music passed by me  
Just like the Grateful Dead

She's interested in me  
I'm interested in her  
But there's a distance  
Each morning as she walks  
Our eyes exchange a thought  
Our hearts, an interest  
I've seen her at the club  
Expanding with the funk  
She looks so brilliant  
She sticks close to her friends  
And when the music ends  
She is the Indian  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
I'm interested to meet  
The girl that looks at me  
I will be trying  
Her color unlike mine  
Her hair the plaited vine  
I will be climbing  
My leg is always pulled  
By friends who really would  
But say they wouldn't  
The joke's against my heart  
Immediately she's barred  
Their hearts are wooden  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  
I'm interested in her  
She's interested in me  
Her distance shortens  
She walks towards the light  
I walk towards the lines  
That seem important  
I'm counting up to ten  
By five she's gone again  
Into the distance  
I'll try again to nudge my  
Courage for the love look  
Without resistance  
I'd like to meet the elephant girl  
I feel we know each other so well  
From eyes that meet the love they seek  
Interested to get close to you  
Interested to get close to you  

I wrote her name on a bar mat  
She had a peculiar bonnet,  
But a youngish damsel figure  
With her tongue tied to a trigger,  
She seemed a total killer  
Her face all filled with filler,  
Her face a painting palette  
I stomached all her habits,  
Sipped her snow balls poshly like a judge  
But left her lipstick traces on her mug.  
We watched each other closely  
She looks like Bela Lugosi,  
She asked me for a ride home  
I felt around for my comb,  
And in the bar room mirror  
I combed right through her figure,  
She wiggled through the car park  
Into the pit of my heart,  
Sat herself beside me in my van  
A ring on every finger of her hand.  
She lived down by the river  
A flat the council give her,  
Wallpaper very scenic  
Her outlook very beatnik,  
We watched the close and weather  
Then through the door he entered,  
Short sleeves and arms of iron  
And me with just my tie on,  
She said the lodger's used to this by now  
I'd handled all the bull but not the cow.  
Behind her velvet sofa  
I found myself back sober,  
She kept an old acoustic  
She never ever used it,  
A gift for me with a capo  
A six string with an f-hole,  
We made the strangest couple  
A Laurel and Hardy double,  
I learnt to play her favorite country songs  
With one or two chords always going wrong

Everybody's dancing  
To the farfisa beat  
All the girls are crazy  
Acting out the heat  
Tie and shirts and cuff links  
Well that's pretty neat  
  
[Chorus]  
Flash flash mirror ball  
Stereo and disco  
Wow wow ain't she tall  
Moved off my feet  
To the farfisa beat  
  
Pulling my side glances  
To the one across the way  
She wears a lot of makeup  
But they all do these days  
Pretty horny tee shirt  
Well might you explain  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Beat for beat for beat for all  
Cut there in the yea  
Everybody's got their girl  
So is there any spare  
For five foot seven  
Of heavy duty wear  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
Moved Off My Feet To The  
  
[Chorus]

There's evil in goodness and goodness in bad  
Remember the first kiss, the first kiss you had  
Choked on her tongue and bit on her lip  
She gave her number but that was it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Did the first thing wrong, did the first thing wrong  
Oh eyes to the ceiling and pants on the floor,  
I did the first thing wrong  
  
Drove to the city to see the bright lights  
The boys on the corner looked ready to fight  
I stuck my neck out and I looked at his face  
I left her standing, I was caught in a chase  
  
[Chorus]  
But its four in the morning and I knock on the door  
She says "how you doin ? " and I say "I'm not sure"  
I kick the bottles all downstairs  
Guys are freaking out - so what? I don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
Did the first thing wrong  
Did the first thing wrong  
Did the first thing wrong

I spent too much money, I looked far too glad  
Now I have so little of what I once had  
I had too many parties I had too much time  
I got so lazy and fell well behind  
Now the summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now  
Footprints in the frost  
The summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
  
We did so much damage deep in our insides  
The party's over it's going home time  
The cathedral is empty, no one's at home  
Winter's approaching paradise postponed  
  
Now the summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost,  
The rain won't stop falling and the people look lost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost.  
  
I rang lots of numbers and walked many miles  
I watched the flinstones and I turned my dial  
To a brand new station where the beat comes in  
Now it's all over the winter begins  
  
The summer is over I can count the cost  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost  
People with umbrellas disappear in the fog  
Footprints on the beaches are now footprints in the frost

Like trying to knock down pins with marbles in my hand  
She wouldn't take a hi from me the average man  
Funny what money can do to people  
But she had a light that had sparked up her evil  
Trying to chat up women who rate themselves so high  
Shouldn't be my subject but I felt like I should try  
Funny what drink can do for soldiers  
Well she must into men a little bit older  
  
Funny how it goes, how money steals the show  
And all her diamonds twinkle as she dances and what's it got for me  
Hung over in my tree?  
I saw the sun shine bright in front of  
  
Trying to get her dancing was not an easy job  
She made out like Houdini when I said do you bop  
Funny what rhythm does it kills me  
Like champagne women only seem to spill me  
Trying to get the picture, I settled down to a drink  
When up came Cinderella, so what was I to think  
Funny how these shoes fit a dragon  
Well she's like the sharks that you get in Manhattan  
  
Funny how it goes, how money steals the show  
And all her diamonds twinkle as she dances and what's it got for me  
Hung over in my tree?  
I saw the sun shine bright in front of

The saddest thing I've ever seen  
Was a starving face on my TV screen  
The desperate face that I saw  
Had my disbelief hanging from my jaw  
Our harvest could be shared around  
Instead it's buried in the ground  
The saddest thing I've ever seen  
Was a football fan dying for his team  
The toughest thing I have ever known  
Was a soldier boy who never made it home  
It's fiction live before our eyes  
It leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
The greatest thing I've ever seen  
Was a newborn child looking up at me  
The greatest sound I've ever heard  
Was a baby's cry in this wicked world  
The innocence of that cry  
Leaves me cold and my heart cries  
  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
It's a heartbreaking world if you want it to be  
And you're the one that breaks it for me

Bar illuminations shiver  
Shadows on the street  
The Cypriot sailors  
Find the world back at their feet  
Endless days of tobacco nights by the radio  
I wonder if they'll ever go to heaven  
The beer mats are wading  
In a table of froth  
The bar girl is serving  
With a check drying cloth  
She'll bend over backwards even though she's knackered  
I wonder if there'll have her up in heaven  
  
Like the sailors I walk home, it's six a.m.  
Heaven's round the corner in a comfortable bed  
And I love her.  
  
The officers and seamen  
Elbow places at the bar  
Words that tempt the goddess  
Don't leave beats upon the heart  
But she'll service his pleasure  
And never know the treasure  
That his wife keeps forever up in heaven  
  
The first light of the morning  
Proves too much for the street  
No one sees each other  
Just their presence there to meet  
Your chin takes to stubble at the sight of a funnel  
And the gangplank is no trouble up to heaven

You're no dame, I'm no duke  
Somehow love is a fluke  
We've survived thick and thin  
Taking knocks on the chin  
In the eyes of the sad  
We may be barking mad  
But the truth has been ceased  
We are like chalk and cheese  
You wind me up and I drive you mad  
It's a fact of life, it goes hand in hand  
And I know that look, it's read like a book  
And I realize  
  
I don't care what the world has to say  
You should know that I love you  
I love you  
I love you today  
  
When the boat starts to rock  
Then my ears start to block  
All the words that you say  
Through the night, through the day  
Where there's muck there is brass  
And the storm soon will pass  
Then it's back to the norm  
All the cold turns to warm  
  
Sometimes I think life crawls like a snail  
And all of our dreams become the wind in your sails  
Without wealth it's true, who cares what you do  
And I realize  
  
I can feel the eyes behind us as we walk  
I can see the ears that listen when we talk

Up in the morning  
Politely yawning  
There's frost on the roof of the car  
First cigarette puffs  
Gold links in my cuffs  
Egg on the shirt of my heart  
  
Fingerprints in the dust with my name  
Squint my eyes to see from my fame  
Spot the words that fall from my lines  
The deafness hides the light from the blind  
  
Stop starting journey  
The road returns me  
Back to the world in the evening  
The stage rehearsals  
Voice on the circles  
Blah blah my way to the ceiling  
  
I can't see the walls from the chairs  
Are there people sitting out there  
Feed me with a frown or a laugh  
Featureless the faces that ask  
  
Tonight I'm cracking  
I'm murder acting  
Footlight the visual of my lines  
I'll smoke and drink it  
I'll eat and think it  
Miserable the murder plot unwinds

I think to myself when we kiss  
Your husband is watching  
From his portrait his eyes are looking down  
On the slipper and stocking  
Back against the bookcase  
Down upon the floor  
Empty the decanter  
Slur again for more  
His house, her home, our future in a lover's world  
Her son, her heart, her love for me, tomorrow's world  
  
I laugh at myself when your son  
Is watching cartoons  
In the morning he's looking up at me  
When we're in the bathroom  
Sees me kissing mother  
Doesn't blink an eye  
Asks a lot of questions  
Answers hard to find.  
  
I talk to myself when I'm drunk  
And she is still sober  
Words are so few and far between  
My arms reach to hold her  
Hungry for the love  
I rescued from the grave  
The past is just a portrait  
The future's ours to frame

Off to the airport to check in the bags  
Proud of my suntan and good times I've had  
Laying on beaches and writing out cards  
Back to the humdrum and bashing out cars  
Into the aircraft I look for my seat  
A nervous tension builds inside me  
Onto the runway I pretend I'm elsewhere  
In minutes we're flying through the hot evening air  
Down there toy town the twinkle of lights  
The long white beaches of holiday time  
Suddenly someone has pulled out a gun  
His shout for attention has everyone stunned  
Hands on our heads there's a new kind of fear  
We're over the barrel with the hits of the year  
  
Held up to ransom assured we'll be safe  
The yellow ribbon comes out again  
How many gods can there be in one sky  
All so important and all so involved  
Here on a trigger a disciple of fear  
As we wait without knowing if we're hits of the year

You're banging your drum  
You blow your own trumpet  
Your ship came in  
And your fanfare sunk it  
The tide has turned  
Our love's gone forever  
I stand on the shore  
As it floats down the river  
  
[Chorus:]  
I had such hopes  
I had such visions planned  
The frames were shot  
But now our future's canned  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down  
  
I'm banging my head  
You watch without malice  
(You watch with no interest at all)  
I bet all your friends  
Compare this to Dallas  
(I might as well talk to a brick wall)  
  
So under the arm  
I feel the cold shoulder  
So I'll once again  
Have to play the wild rover  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Do I need all this pressure  
Do I bury my temper  
I had my hopes so high  
They fell right down

I feel like I'm pounding on a big door  
No one can hear me knocking,  
I feel like I'm falling flat to the floor  
No one can catch me from falling.  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand,  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands.  
The crew have abandoned ship  
The lights are on but now one is in.  
  
Takeittothebridge throwitoverboard

Noonesinthehouse everyoneisout

I feel like I'm calling on a telephone  
No one can hear the ringing,  
I feel like I'm running up a steep hill  
No one can stop me from running.  
The hourglass has no more grains of sand  
My watch has stopped no more turning hands.  
The little hand shakes it's fist  
The face is hanging out on a spring.

She was full of lies and boredom  
It came as no surprise that she would cheat  
Her nails were long and sharp  
But she didn't play the harp  
She wasn't an angel I told her  
But she wasn't able to understand my words  
Rich pickings in reverse  
I wasn't Shakespeare  
It's simple  
Did she expect me  
To kiss her feet  
  
A very acidic tongue  
Waggled in her head  
Life was lots of fun  
At times I had to smile  
In front of everyone  
We seemed the best of friends  
Life had just begun  
When on the roof a tile began to slip  
The house of love caved in and that was it  
  
She was full of tears by nature  
It came to me so clear that she would creep  
Her eyes were stale and spun  
Like marbles in the sun  
She wasn't a princess I told her  
And so I witnessed the slaying of my life  
That lasted half the night  
  
I wasn't Jesus  
Believe me  
Our love was seedless  
And incomplete

I can't get up anymore, my heart ticks so slow  
There's nothing to do, I'm picking my nose  
I'm counting the days that you have been gone  
My heart went to jail, my love's out of song  
I can't get up anymore, I'm lying in bed  
I'm watching the day through a hole in my head  
I turned myself down, I can hardly be heard  
Now I'm without a heart, now I'm without a girl  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
I can't get up anymore I'm a cold piece of toast  
The doormat is full, the newspapers and post  
There's a letter from you, but I'm growing a beard  
It will never be read, cause I'm going so weird  
Look what women can do I've bolted the door  
Now I'm losing a screw  
All this hunger and trial won't achieve a result  
But a nut cant keep tight without the help of a bolt  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I won't get up anymore  
I won't get up anymore  
(I won't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I can't get up anymore  
(Won't get up anymore)  
I won't get up anymore  
(I can't get up anymore)  
I won't get up anymore  
I can't get up anymore  

In the corner by the D.J. unit  
The flag of beauty my eyes salute it,  
She likes love  
By luck or labour  
She likes love  
But not for favour - can't hold on  
She keeps her lips on the straw she's sucking  
Looks up to me but her eyes see nothing,  
Love's her stare  
The steps to her heart  
Love's the climb  
The bite not her bark.  
I pour the milk into the cat's saucer  
I'm John Wayne as I'm walking towards her,  
She'd like to dance  
But not this minute  
She's the fish I'd love to fillet.  
I draw first with a stammer of verbal  
We dance like pigeons forever in circle,  
She likes to dance  
Her cocktails shaken  
She likes love  
And it's temptation  
  
The lights flash green  
My envy lights up  
The lights just flash  
And I feel tied up,  
Love's for sale  
And I am sold on  
But there's no way  
That I can hold on  
I can't hold on

She's been good to me  
And her aim is plain,  
With an open mind  
And a tender way.  
As she looks through boxes of secondhand clothes  
She's a first class person as her best friend knows.  
She's been good to me  
Helped me not to lie,  
Listens to my words  
And the truth she finds.  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.  
I learnt how to pray  
Every night,  
To relieve the pain  
Deep inside.  
  
I was serious with a furrowed brow  
I just fell in love what do I do now?  
As I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.  
  
It didn't work for us the lesson I learnt  
The fire was lit and I got burnt.  
And I fell in love with my very best friend  
I didn't realise that our friendship would end.

Funny words I cannot read  
Trams and boats where Strauss is street  
Milky way and far out looks  
On your bike and Anne Frank books  
  
Down the disco it's clockworktime  
Where's the humour where am I  
This world's got smaller  
I'm shaking lots of hands  
  
Saying lots of things  
That no one understands  
You can shake my tree  
But you won't get me  
  
Where am I  
I think I'm go go, go go, go go  
  
Liquor store and rodeos  
P I X and rock and roll  
The freckled face the thin and fat  
The drive-in films and drive-in macs  
  
Strip and porno neon signs  
Where's the building where am I  
  
Buckingham Palace trains all late  
Funny little men all out in the rain  
Car front deals and after pubs  
Tenth year plays and seedy clubs  
  
Iffy people don't seem to mind  
Where's the action where am I

You took all you could  
And gave all you had  
Knowing that I would have to understand  
As you changed the locks  
And threw out my socks  
There was peace at hand  
You sat in my chair  
Your chin on your knees  
I'm no longer there  
And you look so pleased  
I don't think that I know what to say  
In my heart I love you anyway  
  
I want you today  
How can I score points  
And win back your trust  
Where our two hearts join  
There's a sign of rust  
From the tears you've cried  
With the times I've lied  
To the two of us  
I don't think that I know what to say  
In my heart I want you anyway  
  
I can see the road behind me as I walk  
I can feel the hurt that's burning as I talk  
  
I can see the kids  
As they play outside  
I can read their lips  
Their eyes open wide

When daylight appears  
Through a crack in the curtain  
I'm laying in bed  
Staring up at the skirting  
I'm alone in my room  
But someone is turning the key in the door  
And I wake up to find  
It's still daylight outside  
There's a taste in my mouth  
Like the thoughts in my mind  
And I wake up to find  
That I left on the light the world can take a jump  
I'm feeling like a lump when daylight appears  
Through a crack in my mind  
I won't ever go drinking again  
When daylight appears  
It's the third time around  
And I swear I won't drink  
Ever again with that crowd  
What on earth did I say  
Did I let the side down I've been guilty before  
And I wake up to see  
The old wonderful me  
All naked and wrinkled  
From knots in the sheets  
And I get up to see  
My hair like a tree  
The world can shut the door  
Because I'm feeling so sore when daylight appears with my eyes full of sleep  
I won't ever go drinking again  
  
Aaaaah how my head's like an anvil  
Aaaaah go the sparks as I angle  
Aaaaah goes the spray from the shower  
How could I smell like a flower  
When I feel like weed in the rain  
I won't ever go drinking again

If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
Watching you play in the bath  
A soap suds stickle back navy  
A scrubbing brush landing craft  
Your skin gets softer and warmer  
I pat you down with a towel  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
My mind goes out on the prowl  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
  
If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
I'm playing your stereogram  
Singles remind me of kisses  
Albums remind me of plans  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
The wind plays over the coals  
Passionate looks are my fancy  
But you turn the look into stone  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
If I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you, mmm  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
  
If I didn't love you, I'd hate you  
Cocoa mugs sit side by side  
It's time to poke at the fire  
But it's not tonight  
Looks I find  
Taking a bite on a biscuit  
The record jumps on a scratch  
Tonight it's love by the fire  
The door of your love's on the latch  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I, if I  
If I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you  
Would you sit and glow by the fire  
If I didn't love you  
Would you make me feel so  
Maybe love me  
Oh if I didn't love you, mmm  
  
If I, if I, if I, if I  
Didn't, didn't, didn't, didn't  
Love you, love you, love you, love you

You've left my ring by the soap,  
Now is that love?  
You cleaned me out you could say broke,  
Now is that love?  
The better better better it gets  
The more these girls forget  
That that is love.  
You won't get dressed you walk about,  
Now is that, is that  
A teasing glance has pushed me out,  
Now is that, is that  
The tougher tougher tougher it gets  
The more my lips frequent  
Now that is love.  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
You've called my bluff I'm not so hot,  
Now is that love  
My assets froze while yours have dropped,  
Now is that, is that  
It's the cupid cupid cupid disguise  
That more or less survived  
Now that is love.  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
You've made my bed the finger points  
Now is that, is that love  
The more you more you more you cool down  
The easier love is found  
Now that is love.  

He smokes himself into double vision  
Leaves his mind on an indecision,  
Thinks he's invented imagination  
Says that god is some relation.  
He leaves his cigarette burning on the desk  
His clothes and magazines make up such a mess,  
Sitting up in bed transistor on his chest  
In quintessence.  
  
He and his friends sit around all evening  
Leaving their laughter upon the ceiling,  
Seems so funny yet it leaves me yawning  
Then I find it's the following morning.  
He says his girlfriend lives too far away  
Always at a friend's house or on holiday,  
His bible of romance hides itself away  
In quintessence.  
  
A 15 year old's browse through life,  
Is fine with his quintessence safe and sound in mind,  
Life's an adolescence from time to time  
With us all  
In quintessence.  
  
In the corner with his book and tissue  
All he can do is pretend to miss you,  
Closes his eyes as he sees her body  
Pulls funny faces and that's his hobby.  
On the other hand love ain't a happy word  
On the other hand love ain't a piece of skirt,  
Makes for something special in your football shirt  
In quintessence.

In the morning  
It is raining  
And umbrellas block the pavement  
In the cafae  
People waking  
With a cigarette and coffee  
And she sits there with her paper  
Half asleep into a picture  
In the morning  
In the morning  
It's all over  
That's another night of business  
With the punters  
On the corner  
Of estates around the river  
And she adds up all the takings  
Hid behind her wilting paper  
In the morning  
In the morning  
Soaked in bath oil  
Dressed in pink towels  
And a sweater  
Looking out at all the people  
Walking under their umbrellas  
In the morning  
There's a feeling  
Of resentment and expectance  
It's a fear that comes with working  
On the dark streets for a living  
She's attending  
To her wet hair  
At the window in the evening  
Getting ready in a short skirt  
With her stockings around her ankles  
It'?s a flame that gets attention  
In a darkness without light  
And the children need a cuddle  
As she walks into the light  
Of the morning

Time is a corridor that winds through my life  
Out of each door comes a day  
And when that door closes and I've said good night  
Another door opens again  
Down in the corridor there will be a time  
When I shall run out of doors  
I'll scramble through windows and pull up the blinds  
In another room I'm still not too sure  
That there's no room for me down here  
I shall be sorry  
It will be clear  
And I'll regret not seeing her more  
In today's room love's at the door  
  
I look at my wrist watch, the hands ever turn  
Her face is there I can see  
I'll always regret it but I'll never learn  
Time is so precious to me  
Out in the corridor she sits in a chair  
Here I am pacing the floor  
I've not got the courage, my hand combs my hair  
In today's room I'm still not too sure  
  
That there's no room for me down here  
Will I be sorry  
Well that won't be clear  
And I'll regret not seeing her more  
In today's room love's at the door  
  
In today's room, strawberry jam  
No hope of blue skies holiday plans  
In today's room, trips to the shops  
She's on the doorstep carrying a box

I have no reason to lie to her  
I've been a pig  
I'm a coward out of character  
Here's what I did  
I stole money from out of her purse  
Then I got drunk  
And just to make matters worse  
I then fell in love  
Is it too late to unload that gun  
Is it too late to change her mind  
Is it too late to kick me in the teeth  
Is it too late, knock them down my throat  
Hope I choke on them forever this time  
Is it too late, is it too late, is it too late  
  
Now my cards are all on the table  
My fish is cooked  
Now someone else has rocked my cradle  
Funeral's been booked  
I feel so rotten to have done this  
But now it's been done  
And drink was my only accomplice  
And we fell in love  
  
I have no reason to lie again  
Once is enough  
I played my best hand and lost the game  
Losing is tough  
I barked and wagged my tail in the air  
I got off the lead  
I had all the fun of the fair  
That I'll ever need

You've left my ring by the soap,  
Now is that love?  
You cleaned me out you could say broke,  
Now is that love?  
The better better better it gets  
The more these girls forget  
That that is love.  
  
You won't get dressed you walk about,  
Now is that, is that  
A teasing glance has pushed me out,  
Now is that, is that  
The tougher tougher tougher it gets  
The more my lips frequent  
Now that is love.  
  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
  
You've called my bluff I'm not so hot,  
Now is that love  
My assets froze while yours have dropped,  
Now is that, is that  
It's the cupid cupid cupid disguise  
That more or less survived  
Now that is love.  
  
Beat me up with your letters, your walk out notes,  
Funny how you still find me right here at home.  
Legs up with a book and a drink,  
Now is that love that's making you think.  
  
You've made my bed, the finger points  
Now is that, is that love  
The more you more you more you cool down  
The easier love is found  
Now that is love.

She used to do a topless down at the Surrey Docks  
With tassels on her whatsits she did a t'riffic job  
Of raising all the eyebrows of every lunchtime mob  
She went with all the tossers who kick about a ball  
They say their club's the greatest, and she has kissed them all  
At the Arndale Center, she's up against the wall  
I can't name names cause that's not cricket  
I can't name names that would put me in it  
But that's another story in the finish  
I saw them at the pictures a tangled heap of love  
He had so many women, but only classy stuff  
I saw him at the clinic, a pink card up his cuff  
One holiday in Bognor a stag night hit the town  
The groom is in the car park with his trousers down  
But that's another story that won't be going round  
I can't name names cause that's not cricket  
I can't name names that would put me in it  
But that's another story in the finish  
  
The Deptford had a beano to Southend for the night  
With forty crates of lager, to see the Southend lights  
The got home for their breakfast pissed out of their minds  
This girl gave me the minces so I asked her for a dance  
And in the death I kissed her and so I took a chance  
And when I went to touch her, she tried to break my arm  
I can't name names cause that's not cricket  
I can't name names that would put me in it  
But that's another story in the finish

Hey wait a minute  
That's not right  
I didn't want this to cause a fight  
All I'm saying is  
Nothing new  
Listen to me, believe it's true  
What's there to hide, it baffles me  
Throw out those thoughts of jealousy  
So don't you cry and hold your head  
It's over  
So wait a minute  
Let me explain  
Out of the blue she called again  
To offer me  
A peaceful meal  
So we can talk see how we feel  
It's nothing more than face to face  
So trust in me I know my place  
I know it's hard to let me go  
It's over  
All over  
  
Have confidence  
Have faith  
There is no attraction there  
And believe me  
This way  
I can wash her from my hair  
  
Hey wait a minute  
What's going on  
I'm coming home where I belong  
It's nothing more than face to face  
Give me the time to pack my case  
I know it's hard to let me go  
It's over  
  
What's there to hide it baffles me  
Why should you waste your energy  
But I won't leave if you're not sure  
It's over  
It's all over

Well you'd better not tell I've had a good night  
Me and this bird she's a bit of alright  
Dancing to the sounds as the arches get searched  
She is the business for a bit of old skirt  
It's so dirty when it's in the right mood  
Give it some brandy and some chinese food  
Take her for a spin with your stereo jack  
Tell her she's the best girl you've ever had  
Give it some gold to put round its neck  
Bet here old man puts you on the deck  
But its so dirty with me - it so dirty with me  
Its so dirty with me - its so dirty with me  
  
Well you'd better watch out here comes a tornado  
You'll end up looking like a mashed potato  
If her old man gets word of what's going on here  
You'll end up at the bottom of someone's next beer  
  
Well I've got a bud ain't frightened by shooters  
So lets have a drink for a couple of troopers  
No her old man won't know I've been giving it some  
Unless you tell him the news but we know that ain't done

I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
  
Last night I played the drunken fiddle  
Disabled love with a word of dribble  
On and on about some jumbled subject  
I said your friends were a bunch of muppets  
  
Said your sister should've grown a moustache  
Said you didn't need to take off your mask  
Down the staircase I made my stagger  
I left you cryin' but it didn't matter  
  
And so I sat inside my car in wonder  
A headache in my head like the thunder  
I chewed my nails like a guilty victim  
I couldn't see or feel the night or nothin'  
I wanted to explain, but oh so clever  
Love was like it was some endeavor  
Then I don't remember who said what, when  
On a stack of paper I placed my pen  
  
And when I woke up in the mornin'  
Beside you in the bed  
My mouth was full of nothin'  
My arms around your head  
I don't know how I got there  
But I didn't want to check  
Now back between each other  
We're salvaging our wreck  
Now I've returned  
  
You throw our jigsaw all over the floor  
We're at the deepest deep  
I thought our love had died forever  
But it just went to sleep  
  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned  
I've returned

She's screaming into his collar  
Beating him on the chest  
He's showing her no emotion  
Their love's put to the test  
He thinks that he makes her happy  
By simply being there  
As the silences get longer  
The more she pulls her hair  
Love can be damaged by silence  
Tied to a ball and chain  
Love can be driven to violence  
From what once seemed so tame  
Wearing his dinner this evening  
Jolly comes home again  
  
The mule's sitting by the fire  
The house at his control  
He hops around the channels  
His eyes on film patrol  
She's driven from her senses  
Her mundane life erupts  
She leaps out of the sofa  
And jumps upon her lump  
  
The room was all dark and quiet  
In bed there side by side  
There in the small of her back  
An olive branch tonight  
He wants to say that he's sorry  
She wants to make him beg  
For all the pain that she's suffered  
In her heart and in her head

She left in the middle of the night with the kids  
Wrapped in a blanket with a packet of crisps  
Heading for her mothers on another estate  
The kids looked up at the light and the rain  
In the middle of the night such adventures made  
For two little kids staying up late  
It was rainy and windy as winter was bleak  
At four in the morning on King George Street  
She couldn't get to sleep where on Earth had he gone  
The door opened wide and the light went on  
He was drunk as a lord with a tyre mark hat  
Falling in the hall on top of the cat  
Singing Viva Espana to a crying wife  
He took a swing at the shade on the light  
They were knocking on the doors dressed like refugees  
In the pouring rain on King George Street  
  
She won't have that behaviour in her house any more  
He's got to sober up or get kicked out of the door  
Down on the corner the kids at his feet  
As daddy comes home on King George Street  
  
They stood around the kettle and watched as it brewed  
Sneezing into hankies hands all blue  
The next evening he came around to the house  
With a bunch of flowers they locked him out  
He peered through the window  
Mouthed words through the air  
Her lips to a cup she saw him out there  
The kids came running but were they happy to see  
Their daddy back home on King George Street

It all went wrong when I grew jealous  
I didn't realize my strength  
Could take the life of one so precious  
Together we were known as good friends  
  
Did you ever read the words  
That said love would end I read them tonight  
Mistakes I can't defend  
I didn't stop to think  
And I upset her  
I said good night tonight the last time forever  
I think of her tonight  
She keeps me from my sleep but what can I do  
With all of these memories  
I used to be so shy  
And hide my temper  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever  
  
It all went wrong when I grew jealous  
I didn't realize my strength  
Could take the life of one so precious  
Together we were known as good friends  
  
Did you ever read the words  
That say I love you I read them tonight  
But what good can they do  
I regret what I have done  
It wasn't clever  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever  
I've said good night tonight the last time forever

She plaits her hair, I bite my nails  
We balance love on the scales  
I wind the clock and go to bed  
Our love is hanging on a thread  
She gets undressed, I undress too  
The draft is cold in my bedroom  
We cuddle up and say goodnight  
It's all the love there is tonight.  
I can't be brave enough  
She cannot say what we're feeling  
Day after day  
We're going through the motions  
We find it hard to let each other go  
  
She boils the eggs, I make the tea  
Outside the sun shines on the street  
We're at that point here love has gone  
The fuse is lit, it won't be long  
I take a walk, she cleans the house  
This is the end, I'm in no doubt  
But neither one of us can show  
The slightest sign of letting go

The first circle comes around  
You don't want to leave her side  
You're staying in and don't go out  
You're having such a perfect time  
You make your bed and you lie in it  
And time is precious every minute  
The next circle comes around  
And so domestic you become  
In your matching dressing gowns  
You think your life time's just begun  
You cut the cake but just the one slice  
You're crawling back all through the night  
  
Love circles up above  
It waits until your love  
Breaks down and weeps  
Then it's out of your reach  
Love circles up above  
It waits for your love  
Down on the floor  
Then you're there in its claws  
Love circles up above  
  
The last circle comes around  
You're making plans to fill your days  
You're always wanting to stay out late  
And you can feel love start to fade  
You fall asleep or read a book  
The phone goes back upon the hook  
  
When I lay awake at night  
And love can't be found  
The first circle's on my mind  
It goes round and round and round and round

The full moon's glowing  
Blood red in the sky  
It hangs like fire  
On this winter's night  
I sit on feelings  
That hang in suspense  
Nothing in my life makes sense  
A question mark hangs with the stars up above  
As I'm driving home to the one that I love  
Sometimes I can't see the trees for the wood  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight  
The moonlight changes  
From red into white  
It sits on treetops  
Asleep for the night  
I see the signpost  
The road slowly bends  
Nothing in my life makes sense  
A flashing tail light speeds across the sky  
My head's cooking trouble as thoughts seem to fry  
The last temptation was misunderstood  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight  
I'm faced with the ultimate truth  
What if I see that things don't improve  
I know they could  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
Loving you tonight feels good  
The sun is rising  
There's mist all around  
She sleeps beside me  
And I feel so proud  
Am I in heaven  
With her by my side  
This is how love feels tonight  
Loving you tonight  
Loving you tonight

(deciphering the song we have yet to see.  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness  
The chilly winter nights bring the scarves from the drawer  
A crowd starts to gather on paving stone squares  
Teeth start to chatter as the staff leave the store  
And daughters meet mothers and fathers meet sons  
It's too dark to walk home without anyone  
The shopping precinct's closed, it's like a graveyard  
The chain falls through the spokes as I unlock my bike  
I cycle to the pub where I meet with my friends  
And I know that it's love as she pours me my pint  
And strangers meet strangers and friends share their lives  
I look at her again and feel butterflies  
I pull the pillow to my side  
And I imagine it is her  
As I slip into the night,  
I know what I prefer  
But I hope and I pray that one day she will say  
That's it's true  
I can't live without loving you  
Now there's no one around I push the bike home  
The rain's a lovely sound as it runs down the path  
There's our lights in the road, they amber the night  
And there's nobody home, so I soak in the bath  
And bubbles meet bubbles as they become one  
I think about the world and what I have done  
I pull the pillow to my side etc  
Supermarket lights burn in the darkness (repeat to fade)

She wants to give up love for good  
She kicks the fence and splits the wood,  
She cries her eyes out in the rain  
She swears aloud and so again,  
She feels messed around.  
She takes her coat off as it pours  
The passing daytime she ignores,  
Sits with a problem on a bench  
And with her heel she digs a trench,  
She feels messed around.  
She rips her skirt and tears her dress  
Climbing over his garden fence,  
Mud on her mourning as tears still fall  
She's in no mood for his love at all,  
She feels messed around  
  
Her door won't shut, her match won't light,  
The bulb went out, her skirts too tight,  
She feels messed around.  
The words don't match, her heart won't heal,  
The phone won't pip, her fruit won't peel,  
She feels messed around.  
  
She left herself open for him all the time  
But always kept off of his cloud,  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Have come to mess her around.

Hitched a hiker  
Up above the border  
She'd spent some time  
In Morocco and Gibraltar  
And stole my wallet  
With a picture of my misses  
With fond remembrance  
Of everything with kisses  
From the Isle of Dogs  
To the Egyptian sands  
Where the Arabs chew on dates  
And I haven't forgot what it's like to be  
With misadventure and her mates  
I miss the East End  
High up on the Khyber  
And I'm the target  
For a dozen rebel snipers  
It's not so bad though  
With some beers in the freezer  
And something fancy  
In the air conditioned sleeper  
In moving carpets  
Through the customs at Dover  
Thinking my journey  
Was going to be over  
Then they discovered  
A shipment of Moroccan  
And said excuse me sir  
There's something you've forgotten

She's ahead of her time and she's never lazy  
But something changed your mind and she could drive you crazy  
Volunteers for winter coats and summer clothes that shine  
Volunteers for magazines I read them all the time  
But that's all right  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do da da da  
Down the runway  
Do do do do do do do do do do - do do do do do do do  
She's so ugly  
  
Tidy work never suffers when you stage your abuse  
Cocktails in the evening when you're completely nude  
Models at the motor show and I dribble at the thought  
Models looking like lobsters, convertibles and sports

Eyebrows plucked and toenails cut,  
I'll pick you up with a little luck, all prim and proper.  
Shaven legs and calls to Fred,  
It all depends o' alright then, I can not stop her.  
The makeup box has always got,  
Ever such a lot of odds and sods, in there to offer.  
She needs paints to make her face,  
And make her late again and again  
So I'll knock her  
The tick is tocker.  
Mumbo jumbo words to say,  
Are you coming out,  
Coming out,  
Coming out to play?  
With a broken nose on a sunny day,  
I would bet,  
I would bet,  
None of these girls would ever care,  
Or get upset.  
Or get upset.  
  
Short and fat with a fishnet hat,  
And a hungry cat in a nice new flat, with her Scrabble.  
Sits by the phone when she's all alone,  
And on her own it's a mental home, full of babble.  
Writes with charm to uncle farm,  
With a broken arm in a broken barn, feeds the cattle.  
She hears the hens as she takes the pen,  
And it's now and now it's then [and now and then a little arab friend],  
She would saddle.  
The dip is dabbled  
  
Kissing curls and boyish girls,  
For all the pearls in all the world, wouldn't have me.  
If I had oil and money to spoil,  
I'd mix with loyal and I get some royal, little lassie.  
I'm up at nine down the line,  
To watch the time 'till half past five.  
I wish they'd sack me  
She's at home the milkman's home  
To have a farm and seeds to sow  
It makes her happy  
The chip is chappie.

I'm faced with the facts  
And a fist full of threats  
I stand quite amused  
At the end of the bed  
I have no defense  
For what I have said  
As a handful of love  
Whacks me right round the head  
She's growling and stalking  
And grabs from a pile  
A book that she throws  
And it missed by a mile  
I'm holding a pillow  
And as naked as sin  
I'm backed to a corner  
With a wastepaper bin  
Then up on the mattress  
There's no place to go  
I'm guilty yes guilty  
But there's no place like home  
  
I rewind the hours  
To see what went wrong  
I plead for forgiveness  
And I'm hit like a gong  
It seems that I'm guilty  
Of smiling too long  
When recalling lovers  
That now are long gone  
I'm guilty you're guilty  
So let me be stoned  
The past is the present  
When there's no place like home  
  
Off with the shoes  
And a whack round the head  
Your ear rings like a phone  
Some explanation  
Might patch and mend  
A love that's lost control  
Now there's no place like home

Head on my shoulder  
Tears on my shirtsleeve  
What did I say wrong  
Hurt by a gesture  
Not by reaction  
Is love saying so long  
Inside my heart  
Young young young wise people  
Young young young loud sound  
Onto the dance floor  
Out of the sadness  
Tears without tempo  
Swim in their beauty  
Swim in their upset  
The bell will ring  
For me and my girl  
Up to the altar time standing still  
When he says will you you say you will  
  
It's the proposal  
She thought she'd never  
Hear on a dance floor  
Joy finds its features  
Upon her lipstick  
Kissed with an answer  
Inside my heart-  
All up to day break  
All up to dropsake  
I hear a slow song  
Close gets the love ones  
Onto the dance floor  
The bells are ringing  
For me and my girl  
Nothing can alter nothing can change  
I'll go to pieces, pieces of eight

You find a hair on my jacket  
And you know it's not mine  
You look at my pillow  
But you're wasting your time  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your smile no longer sings  
I'm so out of touch with you  
Now your phone forever rings  
  
You see a code in my book  
And it doesn't ring a bell  
And this girl I am seeing  
Says she really couldn't tell  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
I have seen another heart  
I was so in love with you  
Love and thanks I can I can't  
  
I won't comb my hair for you anymore  
I won't be in early  
I won't be in late  
I won't be in at all so don't sit in and wait  
  
You hear a howl in the dark  
And you hope that it is me  
But there's no chance  
Now there's no one else to see  
  
Because I'm out of touch with you  
Your trap will never be sprung  
I'm so out of touch with you  
So the final verse is sung

In Peyton Place my heart now beats  
And floor boards creak where an angel sleeps  
Her hair hung across her face  
Like a bush hangs across a wall  
She was short with a tidy smile  
I could hear temptation call  
From a fly in her ointment  
To the big feather in her cap  
It's a small world we discover  
I had once worked for her dad  
I was in gear making up stories  
And we laughed at each other's tales  
I watched her lips I wanted to kiss them  
My train of thought went off the rails  
  
In Peyton Place my heart now beats  
And floor boards creak where an angel sleeps  
In Peyton Place  
I lie awake and hear the sound  
That the angels make  
In Peyton Place  
  
The party was now ending  
So she gave me a lift back home  
Somehow I felt so nervous  
She drove so slowly on the road  
Next thing I knew she was in my arms  
Her hair was all over my face  
I brushed it aside she invited me in  
Now my heart beats in Peyton Place  
  
Her hair hung across her face like  
A bush hangs across a wall

She's not a picture above somebody's fire  
She sits in a towel with a purple hair dryer,  
She waits to get even with me.  
She hooks up her cupcakes and puts on her jumper  
Explains that she'll be late to a worrying mother,  
She meets me in Piccadilly.  
A begging folk singer stands tall by the entrance  
His song relays worlds of most good intentions,  
A fiver a ten p in his hat for collection.  
  
She talks about office she talks about dresses  
She's seen one she fancies her smile is impressing,  
So maybe I'll treat her someday.  
We queue among strangers and strange conversation  
Love's on the lips of all forms of engagements,  
All queuing to see tonight's play.  
  
A man behind me talks to his young lady  
He's happy that she is expecting his baby,  
His wife won't be pleased but she's not been round lately.  
  
The girl was so dreadful we left in a hurry  
We escaped in the rain for an Indian curry,  
At the candle lit Taj Mahal.  
My lips to a napkin I called for a taxi  
The invite of eyes made it tense but relaxed me,  
My mind took a devious role.  
  
The cab took us home through a night I'd not noticed  
The neon club lights of adult films and Trini Lopez,  
My arm around love but my acting was hopeless.  
  
We crept like two thieves from the kettle to the fire  
We kissed to the sound of the silence that we'd hired,  
Now captured, your love in my arms.  
A door opened slightly a voice spoke in worry  
Mum went to bed without wind of the curry,  
Our secret love made its advance.  
  
Like Adam and Eve we took bite on the apple  
Loose change in my pocket it started to rattle,  
Heart like a gun was just half of the battle.

Swallow me say swallow me  
Take me to your nest of china dolls  
Call me up your closest friend  
Join me in my neighbourhood patrol  
Happy me say happy me  
Chinese whispers bounce from ear to ear  
The night is young I feel so old  
See the stars above the night's so clear  
I used to come home late and lie, lie, lie  
She used to see through that but still I tried  
I couldn't cover up the tracks I'd made  
That's how it used to be but not today  
  
Race around I race around  
Focused on the here and now with you  
Every smile's a valentine  
What harm can a little loving do  
Fall about then fall about  
Drunk on love I can't stand on my feet  
Before I try please take my hand  
I've so many words left I should eat  
  
Tickle me please tickle me  
Laughter climbs the walls above our bed  
This night we have is built on love  
Help me so I do not lose the thread  
  
Swallow me say swallow me  
Happy me say happy me  
Race around I race around  
Fall about then fall about  
Tickle me say tickle me  
Love me do sing love me do

I can't remember what happened last night  
Was there trouble or was there a fight  
I was out with what was her name  
What I did will I ever do again  
And if I did it then what did I do  
Would you let that happen to you  
I'll give this morning back to my bed  
I can't remember I might be dead  
Cupids arrow sliding through the sky  
See you tomorrow come around tonight  
I can't remember what your kiss is like  
I can't remember if you're black or white  
I wish I could, I wish I would remember what  
I can't remember what happened at all  
  
I found my suit all over the hall  
My telephones looking upside down  
Was there paint all over the town  
Is it sunny and is it July  
Does it matter and if so then why  
I'll give this morning back to my cot  
I can't remember if I've been shot  
  
I can't remember which body is mine  
Is it the left or is it the right  
Maybe I had an excess of drink  
What's this mess I find in the sink  
Ashtrays emptied all over my shoes  
Everytime I this booze  
Can't find time for words on the phone  
I'll leave today to play on its own

You make-believe celebrities  
Taking bows in front of me  
In your dickey-bow ties  
In your dickey-bow ties  
  
Pick your nose beside the stage  
Jesus Christ has come of age  
So you've had a good cry  
So you've had a good cry  
  
Reach out there's people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isn't very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
  
In the dressing room you find  
Telegrams with good luck lines  
So nice to be known  
So nice to be known  
  
The curtain falls so that's the end  
You hit the bottle once again  
So you've had a good crowd  
So you're one of the crowd  
  
Reach out there's people in the stalls  
A Blackpool season isn't very small  
Reading commercials on TV  
Is just as good as a bad Page 3 review  
  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you  
Revue  
We all know it's so hard for you

Yes I cried the moment that her hand slapped my face  
A mouth full of sandwich went all over the place  
She left like a tornado the door of course slammed  
I stood in the kitchen a very confused man  
The thump thump of her foot steps went right up the stairs  
The cat ran for cover to the living room chairs  
But what was the problem what on earth could be wrong  
To deserve a slapped face it all seemed far too strong  
  
Rose I said, heaven knows what we've done  
Rose I said, water flows under the bridge  
Rose I said, heaven knows is this love  
Rose I said, curtains close back to read the script  
  
Up to the bedside where she lay in tears  
The drawers were left half open, her clothes laying near  
A suitcase tipped sideways at the end of the room  
I swallowed my sandwich and picked up her boots  
She turned just like an actress, a glare came my way  
I said what's the matter, what have I done today  
She spat out the name of the girl across the road  
I'll never forget the way she flared her nose  
  
Rose was the girl who some days I'd drive to work  
She worked in the office as an articled clerk  
Sometimes we had lunch in the pub along the street  
There was nothing between us, just good company  
I admit that I liked her but that's all it was  
I stood at the bedside in a state of shock  
She heard it different from a friend she met today  
Who says she saw us kissing down an alleyway  
I felt like two people a Jekyll and a Hyde  
I'd really made my bed to lay in this time  
I picked with my tongue at the bread stuck in my teeth  
There through the window, her house on the street  
I knew I was guilty, I told myself to lie  
It seemed to make no differen

Hand me a tissue  
Hand me your hand  
I feel like crying please understand  
I have been foolish  
  
I crossed that line  
That borders friendship  
In this bed of mine  
We slept together  
  
And it felt so wrong  
Now I know forever  
That that friendship has gone  
She wore the night shirt  
  
You would have worn  
If you'd been there  
If I had've tried  
To stop myself acting  
  
Like I chose to do  
Is this the end  
Need we pretend  
I slept with a friend  
  
And hurt you  
  
Hand me your pencil  
Hand me your heart  
I feel like writing where do I start  
We drank together and jumped into bed  
  
I had the pleasure  
Then I lost my friend  
We slept together and the guilt's so strong  
Now I know forever  
  
That that friendship has gone

Slightly drunk once again  
All alone with my pen  
I thought I'd write to you  
How can I say how I feel ?  
Falling down on a deal  
This last night with you  
Is it the cold that makes me shake?  
I just hope that I'm awake  
I say alright I knew  
(I knew)  
  
[CHORUS:]  
I was wrong you were right  
(That's a line I cannot find)  
I could not say goodbye  
(to explain just why I lied)  
Why's it always feel the same?  
(slightly drunk what you said to me)  
I'm in love once again  
(can't fall in love without misery)  
  
I'm pretty sad but so what?  
I should be glad but I'm not  
I'm confused once more  
All tangled up in your love  
Without it now so that's tough  
My heart cries for  
  
A little talk to anger me  
Out on the road especially  
Back to you once more  
(once more)  
  
[CHORUS ]  
Slightly drunk once again  
All alone without friends  
Had it all, I know I lied  
All my ends seem untied  
I cannot say how I feel

Some Americans are very pretty  
Some Americans are very shy  
Some Americans are Disney people  
Some Americans eat apple pie  
Some Americans scare me, the leader of the pack  
Living in this theater  
I'm waiting for the trap to drop in the show  
Some Americans gung ho  
  
Some Americans are very happy  
Some Americans will always win  
Some Americans are party people  
Some Americans go out and sing  
  
Some Americans are very lucky  
Some Americans are very poor  
Some Americans are burger people  
Some Americans say no to war

She gave to me her tenderness  
Her friendship and her love  
I see her face from time to time  
There in the sky above  
We grew up learning as we went  
What a voyage our life could be  
It took us through a wilderness  
Into the calmest sea  
Her smile could lift me from the pain  
I often found within  
She said some things I won't forget  
She made a few bells ring  
So simple her humility  
Her beauty found in grace  
Today she lives another life  
In some fantastic place  
She showed me how to raise a smile  
Out of a bed of gloom  
And in her garden sanctuary  
A life began to bloom  
She visualized a world ahead  
And planned how it would be  
She left behind the strongest love  
That lives eternally  
I have the hope that when it's time  
For me to come her way  
That she'll be there to show me around  
Whenever comes that day  
Her love was life and happiness  
And in her steps I trace  
The way to live a better life  
In some fantastic place, some fantastic place.

I bought a toothbrush, some toothpaste  
A flannel for my face  
Pyjamas, a hairbrush  
New shoes and a case  
I said to my reflection  
Let's get out of this place  
Past the church and the steeple  
The laundry on the hill  
Billboards and the buildings  
Memories of it still  
Keep calling and calling  
But forget it all  
I know I will  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
What's been going on  
Now that you have gone  
There's no other  
Tempted by the fruit of another  
Tempted but the truth is discovered  
I'm at the car park, the airport  
The baggage carousel  
The people keep on crowding  
I'm wishing I was well  
I said it's no occasion  
It's no story I could tell  
At my bedside empty pocket  
A foot without a sock  
Your body gets much closer  
I fumble for the clock  
Alarmed by the seduction  
I wish that it would stop  
I bought a novel, some perfume  
A fortune all for you  
But it's not my conscience  
That hates to be untrue  
I asked of my reflection  
Tell me what is there to do

It felt so bad that I'm in pain  
Then why don't I say no not again  
Your love has failed and all's gone sour  
You have to see her every hour  
When you can't sleep your mind is blank  
But you don't love no longer thinks  
You lose the grip you thought you had  
She smiles at you but you are sad  
So if then heaven sees in you  
Then suddenly its over, through  
You take your life into your hands  
Forgetting all your other plans  
  
And your so sad you cut your wrists  
And they can show you what they missed  
You labor now a point in pain  
But will your worst day ever end  
When you lose or when you've gained  
Don't give up, Don't start again  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take you're life, you're gone for good  
You'll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue you're looking pale  
Love can kill you suck you down  
Suicidal up - side down  
Love's a mystery to us all  
So don't be mistaken what a call  
  
Remember when we used to fight  
And fists would fly throughout the night  
Your face is filled with cherry blood  
And so I feel my time has come  
You tore me from the world I knew  
And suddenly its finished, through  
Your feelings burned like forest wood  
You take you're life, you're gone foor good  
  
You'll miss her bed but not her brains  
There is no need to mention names  
My reasons strong that all has failed  
Your face is blue you're looking pale

Business as usual at the harmony home  
Up for the weekend to see my father  
So I'm the one beneath the unturned stone  
I begin the ritual fortnight saga  
Get in the cab, bags packed with clothes  
Cassette player, the jungle of hose  
A pair of shoes for walking in  
Out of the cab, the doorbell rings  
  
Hungover greetings from the man in my life  
A hug, a kiss, and a mug by the fire  
He says I should need a woman I might like  
I drop my bags and walk right by her  
  
Get in the bath, bubbles up high  
Cassette player plays in the night  
She's at the door, wants to come in  
I'm in the bath, I loudly sing  
  
Business as usual at the harmony home  
I can't believe it how time flies  
I'm waving

I had finally beat my nerve  
To watch her on the stage  
Removing all her clothes  
Revealing only age  
Some men stared with a stun  
Some sat in married guilt  
That night I chewed a brick  
For ideals I had built  
And there we were in each other's arms  
The very 1st dance that seemed to last  
For ever  
  
Our heads they almost touched  
Our feet beneath us moved  
Professional her dance  
And me the horses hoof  
The lights the beat the vision  
I'd conjured in my head  
Had magically appeared  
And disappeared again  
  
The music stopped we parted  
But only for a bar  
Off to the Bahamas  
Back into her arms  
The excitement of a kiss  
Quenched my lovers thirst  
We walked into the cold night  
A night to remember

She's independent  
She's a modern woman  
She needs no prompting  
On her should 'n' shouldn't  
It's always bosses  
Who wish that she wouldn't  
Files in the cabinet so neatly numerical  
Makes all the clients so neatly alphabetical  
Turn of twenty one  
She's looking at the map  
Looking at her watch  
Bags on the rack  
It seems like she's there at the top  
  
There for her service  
Comfy red Granada  
Up to the midlands  
  
With a taped Sinatra  
Plans all the hotels  
And the airplane charters  
Found under covers with some representative  
The deal is effected but still only tentative  
  
Shorthands a letter  
Heading on the paper  
Slimline her lunch break  
Will it ever make her  
Slender and modern  
So all the men will take her  
Back to the mirror in the empress hotel  
Where the businessman smiles and the object is sell

As much as I love you  
As much as I care  
I just can't pretend that  
The problem's not there  
We know all the boundaries  
From where we both stand  
Our life has been happy  
Without any plan  
But now I feel sorrow  
As friendship turns stale  
Our love's still on track but  
Without a third rail  
The moon has come up now  
The sun has gone down  
A million or more times  
Since you've been around  
Our life still goes on but  
It won't be the same  
As when we're together  
Love only knows pain  
With words that are tender  
Our love will prevail  
But can our love go on  
Without a third rail  
  
White clouds appear like cotton wool  
The wind bends trees to bow  
As we farewell this love of ours  
Like some old sacred cow  
As sure as heaven's above us  
And hell is down below  
Without a third rail to drive us  
We'll have no place to go  
  
There's a lump in my throat  
I'm choked as I say  
Our love has reached twilight  
Let's call it a day  
We kiss on the platform  
The doors slowly close  
Like theatre curtains  
Pulled after the show  
We both know it's over  
And somehow we've failed  
Love's going in circles  
Without a third rail

I lost the children  
But they can be found  
Home in a red house just across town  
Sitting in boxes  
Of opened up toys  
Watching The Simpsons  
And making some noise  
I lost the children  
But they're in great hands  
When I cook the dinners  
Right out of tin cans  
I lost the children  
And I have to pay  
Some heavy duty on life everyday  
Cupboards need filling  
With deadlines to meet  
Here in my cheque book  
My fountain pen weeps  
I should be thankful  
And thankful am I  
I went to the cleaners  
And came back with my life  
For a moment it all looked so grim  
It looked like I would not get a thing  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
I lost the children  
They haven't lost me  
We're still together and happy to be  
Out in the summer  
On beaches in parks  
Home in the winter and up with the larks  
I should be thankful  
And thankful am I  
I went to the cleaners  
And came back with my life  
From pushchairs to games of football  
My back was against every wall  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
For a moment it all looked so grim  
It looked like I would not get a thing  
For a moment it all looked so sad  
But now it's so good to be a dad  
I lost the children  
They haven't lost me

She left her school for the factory  
From pocket money to a salary,  
From a pac-a-mac to a compact case  
And every morning she inspects her face.  
She discovers pulling pints in pubs  
That the good looks will never cover up for  
Her dumbness in taking the stock  
Sees her reflection in a butcher's shop.  
She finds it all quite rare  
That her meat's all vanity fair.  
  
She has her eyes on medallion men  
Who get her home on the dot at ten,  
She combs her hair when she gets excused  
The deal she wants always ends up screwed.  
Paints her nails on the bathroom scales  
Gargles her breath like a landed whale,  
Her beauty is as deep as her skin  
Keeps her eyebrows in a tobacco tin.  
She poses foot on the chair  
Coconut shy but vanity fair.  
  
In her vanity case her compact case  
In her compact case her eyes,  
Not bad for a sister  
But her vanity's fair and her sense of humour's dry.  
She comes home late with another screw loose  
She swears to have had just a pineapple juice,  
Falls asleep fully clothed in her bed  
With her makeup remover by her head.  
And she might not be all there  
But her dream's all vanity fair.

I need some help  
Help to decide  
Whether it's our love  
That steps out of time  
You say you need  
Time on your own  
Time to accept how  
Our love has grown  
And when you think about  
All of the bad in me  
Think about this too  
How me and you could forever be  
  
In need of help  
Help to expand  
With each others minds  
Together to plan  
Time in our lives  
Time on our own  
So one day we'll see  
Our love has grown  
  
And when that day arrives  
I don't know where we'll be  
But I hope that trust  
Can be for us  
And you'll still love me  
  
I need some help  
Help to be found  
When you are alone  
I won't let you down  
We all need time  
Time on our own  
So we can step back  
And see how love's grown  
  
And when I'm stepping back  
I hope that I will see  
That faith can play a part today  
For both you and me  
  
And if love needs help  
And if love needs time  
Give love the strength  
To walk a straight line

A black and white photograph  
Of me up the garden path  
Wrapped up in my football scarf  
It sits here in my hand  
And there mother smothered me  
And how she would mother me  
She knew how to suffer me  
Like all mothers can  
Now she is everywhere  
The comb that runs through my hair  
My posture on a chair  
But that's not who I am  
He ran from the arguments  
And sat on the garden fence  
And lived in the passing tense  
That fell from her lips  
He tended the house so well  
And each time she rang his bell  
He'd climb back from where he fell  
And gathered his wits  
Now I fear the mold is mine  
A vibration shakes my spine  
As I walk the crooked line  
Reality hits  
  
So let me walk free from you  
You know that you want me to  
Let me try something new  
Let me walk away  
  
If it's not one thing it's your mother  
How I love her  
How I love her  
How I love her  
But it's not so easy to say  
Please won't you let me walk away  
Let me walk away  
Let me walk away  
  
So let me walk on my own  
And finish my ice cream cone  
If we are to make it home  
Then all will be well  
Look see I'm a father now  
I'm raising my own eyebrow  
And being in my own row  
And making life hell  
This is me, see here I am  
Doing the best that I can  
This life has a subtle plan  
But you couldn't tell

Pacing through the flickering light  
A velvet patch upon his eye  
His pacing creaks the floorboards loose  
As he tailors his thoughts for the truth around truths  
But his butler keeps eyes through a hole in the door  
What the butler don't see ain't a lot that's for sure  
Francesca lays across the couch  
They fight with words from mouth to mouth  
And then with handfuls of her flesh  
See how the zipper broke off of her dress  
Strangling her neck with his hands in her gloves  
The port and the brandy mix cocktails of love  
  
The porch light, the torchlight  
The frosted morning lawn  
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn  
On the tale of what the butler saw  
  
He kept his world all to himself  
And locked it tight inside his belt  
But she preferred his belt undone  
She bathed in his fortune but never his fun  
He cracked on a mixture of opera and drink  
The butler still fetches and carries for him  
  
The butler dragged down to the lake  
Francesca's body in a cape  
No private eye was gonna trace this  
The old man was shaking, his marbles were missed  
The shadows and footprints and flickering lights  
The butler's up late with a cold in his eye  
  
The porch light the torchlight the frosted morning lawn  
The cloak of daylight has finally been drawn  
On the tale of what the butler saw

When the hangover strikes  
And I open my post  
And the coffee is on  
And I'm burning my toast  
  
I let the battle commence  
I see a sun in the trees  
And a draught at the door  
With my head in my lap  
  
There's a day to explore  
But I'm left without sense  
As the hangover strikes  
And I turn on the tap  
  
But the water's too loud  
And I'm caged by the fact  
That the battle's not lost  
Is it the hair of the dog  
  
Or the Baa of a Lamb  
In a sheepish attempt  
To be half of the man  
That I might be or was  
  
When the hangover strikes  
And a mirror reveals  
That it's Midnight or bust  
And a drink does appeal  
  
Now the battle is won  
So the cure of the can  
Pours its heart out on me  
Though I'm feeling locked up  
  
But I can't find the key  
Well no damage was done  
  
Poor poor poor, poor shaken one  
Pour pour pour, pour me another one

I could smell the rain  
Dripping through the fresh cut grass  
I could spell your name  
On the wet and steamed up glass  
But you were just a name, a face I had conceived  
As being beautiful, very beautiful  
And so hard to believe  
I could catch the drops  
As they fell from on the roof  
I could hardly stop  
Feeling so long in the tooth  
Before I had to guess at what you might be  
And being beautiful, very beautiful  
Is the face I still see  
  
Who are you?  
Imagination painted you  
Who are you?  
With its finest brush  
Who are you?  
Each stroke with tender love  
Who are you, who are you, who are you?  
  
I could see her face  
Magically there she was  
My mouth drew a taste  
So sweet it lingered on  
And there she was by me, walking through the square  
And being beautiful, very beautiful  
At last I found her there

Who's that kissin' in the corner?  
And who's that talkin' on the phone?  
Who's that smilin' like a soldier?  
And why you tellin' me to go?  
  
Who's that drinkin' all the Daniels?  
And who's that sittin' in the rain?  
Who's that readin' all my annuals?  
And why's it sunny once again?  
  
As blind as a bat  
As wise as an owl  
Let go of me, let go of me now  
Who is that, who is that, who is that?  
  
Who's that playin' a sonata?  
And who's that mimicin' my nerves?  
Who's that actin' like Sinatra?  
And why has angel dressed in furs?  
  
So who's that walkin' like the penguin?  
And who's that handin' me a stout?  
Who's that always never ending?  
And no I didn't even come.  
  
So who's that dancin' kind of reggea?  
And who's that askin' for a fight?  
Who's that? Is it necassary  
To kick me out into the night?  
  
Who's that drinkin' all the Daniels?  
And who's that sittin' in the rain?  
Who's that readin' all my annuals?  
And why's it sunny once again?

I had the rug pulled from under my feet  
But I didn't feel a thing  
I can't believe the luck I seem to have  
And the joy that good luck brings  
When I die Ill return as a housefly  
And land upon her wall  
So I can see who shell end up with  
If its anyone at all  
Did I say that  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel  
I sat and listened to the radio  
A landscape of moving noise  
She was busy looking through the curtains  
Her nose in a distant void  
Then I thought I would come back as a spider  
Because she hates them so much  
They get sprayed down the bathroom plughole  
Can I expect the same touch  
Maybe not then  
Because beneath it all were wicked and cruel  
  
Shut up, listen to the radio  
I can't help feeling I've been stepped on  
She likes to kick like a mule  
Did I say that  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel  
  
If I come back as her would I love me  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel  
  
She likes to think I'm a fool  
Two fools in love  
How could anyone be so wicked and cruel

Within these walls of without you  
I feel naked and without a friend  
Love was once there all around you  
Now I feel our relationship end  
I can't put my finger on a reason  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
Within these walls a heart broken  
And memories of a holiday  
The sea leaves my heart so unspoken  
With the lights folding up on the waves  
  
I don't think I'll ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall  
  
No unhappy memories are there of you  
When I close my eyes I see  
An image of your love forever true  
But not forever for me  
  
I don't think I'll ever have the answer  
I have no answer to give at all  
Within these walls of without you  
I sit crying but the tears will not fall

I feel so empty  
As the plane takes off  
I see the ground below  
I know that one day  
It won't be long  
That you will also know  
Just how it feels  
To leave you now, a hollow shell  
A broken bow  
I feel so empty high up in the air  
Where heaven's meant to be  
The distance gets me  
When I'm on my own  
Without you here with me  
  
My world is turning  
But it's upside down  
Now you're so far away  
While you are learning  
How this world spins round  
I'm in some other day  
What can i do  
But give my heart  
From far away  
A distant spark  
  
I feel a challenge  
For both you and i  
That's how it has to be  
In life there's balance  
I hope time will fly  
Without you here with me  
  
What i am hoping for  
As life moves on  
And we reach finer years  
We won't be thinking  
Of the time that's gone  
Or wading through our tears  
We'll smile as one  
And speak with pride  
How life has swung  
Back on our side  
  
I feel tomorrow  
Can't come by too soon  
To bring you back to see  
That love will follow  
Like the red balloon  
And you'll come home to me  
I want you here with me

The crown of the kingdom is given to the woman  
The kingdom of the kitchen where she says she shouldn't,  
There on the stainless steel her cigarettes and matches  
Whistles to the radio to every hook she catches,  
  
But the frowns  
Eider downs,  
Tie her down  
But she likes to wear the crown of the kingdom.  
  
She like the recipes a touch of oriental  
Steaming up the windows burning egg on metal,  
Sees in a catalogue a shiny new appliance  
Another role swallowed by the wonders of science,  
  
Lobster hands  
Omelette pans,  
Understand  
How the crown can stick like jam in her kingdom.  
  
He's been so busy and she's been neglected,  
The problem is computed and always it's rejected,  
Out of her heart I catch a spark,  
And being smart  
The crown is left out in the dark now there's no kingdom.  
  
Fed up with the glory she abdicates her title  
Sitting at a bar stool she gives her day's recital,  
The family watch in horror  
As she staggers up the hallway  
Makes herself a sandwich  
As they're looking through the doorway,  
She goes to bed  
Leg by leg,  
Nothing's said  
There's no crown upon her head there's no kingdom.  
  
Press the button on the toaster  
It's a woman's world,  
Tuck the sheets in on the bed  
It's a woman's world,  
Take your apron from your holster  
It's a woman's world,  
Shoot the crown off of your head  
It's a woman's world.

Across the ocean she's been waiting to hear  
If love's a secret to all the things she fears  
Was it tiptoe around my pillow talk  
They'll come the only boy she had with any thought  
  
The heart pretends I'm not so far away  
She said tomorrow and I'm here today  
  
I miss her now and I say it's only true  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
  
I'm forgettin' to remember to forget  
All the memories locked in my head  
I'll be home then you'll hear what I say  
It seems forever started only yesterday  
My heart keeps time which passes very slow  
When you're lonely without a place to go  
I've got the lonesome ocean blues  
I feel like I'm on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
  
Across the ocean there's a heart that beats for me  
Beat, beating, waiting patiently  
Pulls us together when we're apart  
Keeps the devil from playing with your heart  
But I'll pretend we're not so far away  
I'm home tomorrow or maybe it's today  
Across the ocean there's nothing else to do  
It feels like you're on the wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon) Wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)Wrong side of the moon  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)  
(Wrong side of the moon)
