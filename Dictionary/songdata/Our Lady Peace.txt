(Story about a girl)  
(Story about the world)  
  
Suddenly I'm something I'm not  
I'm something that you bought  
Was it something I said  
My friend  
Little girl are you tripping on this  
Are you tripping all over it  
You better come up for air  
  
A Story about a girl  
A Story about the world  
  
Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding, holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise I'll always, always  
Be there  
  
Baby girl, stand up and fight  
This is not some paradise  
It's just where we live  
Finally you think you're alright  
Then it eats you up alive  
You better get used to it  
  
A story about a girl  
A story about the world  
  
Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding, holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise I'll always, always  
Be there  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are  
  
I know  
It's stuck inside your head  
You're alone  
You better get used to it  
And I know  
The feeling has to end  
You're strong  
It sucks you in again  
And you're lost  
You can't make any sense  
This world  
It tears you limb from limb  
And hold on  
You're nothing but the best  
  
Are you waking up slowly  
Nothing but lonely  
Are you waking up  
Holding, holding your breath  
Are you looking for something  
I promise you one thing  
I promise I'll always, always  
Be there  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are  
  
With all my faith  
And all my heart  
And all those simple things you are

Fell asleep today  
North Ontario  
Woke up far away  
A place I didn't know  
  
A woman smiled at me  
She said, "welcome to my home"  
Life is different here she said it's not  
Camouflage with gold  
  
And hey, leave the light on for me  
And hey, leave the light on for me  
  
Might not make it home  
Can't leave here tonight  
Not afraid to live  
Not afraid to die  
  
And hey, leave a light on for me  
And hey, leave a light on for me.

A suburban man  
At my door  
But I don't think I'll let him in  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
Control over the way I live  
  
He wants the best for me  
Old school philosophy  
So I can't turn my back on him  
He'd buy me anything  
But I just need a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all for you  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
You're the blood, I'm the seed  
And it's all that I need  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
You've got me, oh, you've got me  
  
Jack Kerouac  
Kerouac  
On the road and in my head  
I need relevance  
Intelligence  
A new tattoo and lots more sex  
  
Broken families  
Are the new enemies  
And you will not make up for this  
This suburban man  
He wants discipline  
Discipline  
But I just need a friend  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where you want  
  
Alone  
Leave me alone  
  
It's all for you  
You've got me where you want  
It's all for you, oh  
Just stop breaking my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's all for you  
(Just stop breaking my heart) [Repeat x6]  
  
Leave me alone

You, looked at me as you walked in the room  
Like the red sea, you split me open  
Somehow I knew these wings were stolen  
All you did was save my life  
  
Tried to run but I couldn't move  
Well I paid for these concrete shoes  
But like a singer that sings the blues  
You saw hope in the hopeless  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm not dying  
All you did was save my life  
Pulled me out of that flat line  
Put the heartbeat back inside  
I'm not dying  
All you did was get me through  
I owe every breath to you  
Heart and soul unparalyzed  
All you did was save my life  
  
Save my life  
  
I'm not for sale but I've been sold  
The more I hear the less I know  
And the lies are swallowed whole  
In their insignificance  
The story's been told a million times  
But it's different when it's your life  
I won the lottery tonight  
The lottery tonight  
The lottery tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I started to come around  
The dogs are backing down  
I'm not afraid to see  
  
The devil's gone underground  
This tightrope's been cut down  
And I can finally breathe  
  
You, looked at me as you walked in the room  
Like the red sea you split me open  
Somehow I knew these wings were stolen  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All you did was save my life  
(Put the heart beat back inside)  
All you did was save my life  
(Put the heart beat back inside)  
All you did was save my life.

You're a little bit shy  
A little too quiet  
You're the mixed up girl  
That everybody leaves behind  
A little bit weird  
A little too bright  
But you just might be  
That little bomb at their side  
They'll pull your hair  
They'll leave you wide-eyed  
But did anybody wonder  
What Annie might have in mind  
Oh, no  
  
There's something in the way she explains to me  
"Please be careful, I exist in someone else's head"  
Oh, no  
There's something in the way that she makes believe  
Please be careful,  
Annie dreams that everyone is dead  
  
You're a little bit dry  
A little uptight  
You're the messed up girl  
That every body tries to hide  
You've had enough  
They're too unkind  
But did anyone consider  
What Annie might have in mind  
Oh, no

You, you're me  
I'm the lock, you're the key  
You're the air, the air, I breathe.  
But tonight I'm choking  
  
You are my life  
You are my life  
  
You, you're the sea  
I'm the waves crashing  
On the ground  
The ground under your feet  
I'm a liar, a thief  
And I'm, I'm an apology  
  
You are my life  
You are my life  
  
You are my life  
You are my life  
  
Don't go  
Don't go  
Don't go  
Don't go  
Don't go.

Your life has seemed so hard  
It's been dried up  
Angels that can't keep guard  
I'm trying to reach your hand  
But I'm on fire  
I never planned to fade away  
Stay with me  
  
Stop pretending  
When they say that your nothing  
Are you sad, are you holding yourself  
You shouldn't be  
Are you sad, are you locked in your room  
You shouldn't be  
I'm drowning inside your head  
Help me to answer  
  
Help understand  
But its been so long  
Since we talked like friends  
Please forgive me  
I'm just a man  
Whose made  
Mistakes.

And Sara thinks she's died here once before  
She's crazy  
A pop-up book of flowers from grade four  
Are driving her insane  
  
No-one knows why  
She's sad tonight  
No-one can help her find  
Crying, she couldn't afford the view  
Crying, these automatic flowers won't do  
  
Another brick  
Another window frames the confusion  
Her garden blooms but Sara can't see straight  
She's drinking herself blind  
  
No-one knows why  
She's stares outside  
No-one can help her find  
Crying, she couldn't afford the view  
Crying, these automatic flowers won't do  
These automatic flowers won't do

I looked  
I looked up to the sky  
Your face was drawn in black and white  
Tonight we're stuck inside a lie  
The fear is we won't get out alive  
The stink is in the air  
The air is getting thin  
  
Where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
Stay down where you are  
And where you goin  
Is is better than here?  
  
The truth... . how we turned into a joke  
And it's truth IMd give anything to hold  
Tonight, tonight I stay  
But you, you slip away  
  
Where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
Stay down where you are  
And where you goin  
Don't let them come after you  
  
I trip trip trip in vain  
I like to get a away  
You like it like you do  
I like to be with you  
I like to live up there  
But I wake up and I  
I wake up and I  
I wake up and I'm here  
Tonight I am stuck here  
And tomorrow I,  
I disappear  
  
And where you goin  
As fast as you can run  
And where you goin  
You hide behind the sun  
Stay down low  
And stay down where you are  
Cause it's better there  
And it's better than we thought

I've never seen your breath before  
But I'm disgusted by the thought of  
Waiting anymore  
If I look up in your eyes  
Will you notice me or notice it or  
Fade into this accident  
I don't want to find  
The big dumb rocket on your mind  
Its mostly you and mostly me  
And a tired gun that's not empty  
I've never been this sad before  
But I'm disgusted by my fingertips  
And what they've done  
If I look into your eyes  
If it must be true you must believe  
I've never held such violent things  
I've never talked to God before tonight  
But I'm disgusted by

From Demo  
  
Well I want to know what's happening  
I want to know the time  
You're talking to God and looking the other way  
You're losing your mind  
  
And when you close your eyes  
The celebration ends  
And there'll be no more lies  
It's just another blind (blind) anniversary  
Blind (blind) Anniversary-hehaheyeaahhhhhhh  
  
Well I want to know where the country is  
And I want the other side  
You're fighting the pain  
And fighting the push and pull  
And leave it behind  
  
And when you realize much more than this  
But I'm too limb to celebrate this blind (blind) anniversary  
Blind (blind) Anniversary-hehaheyeaahhhhhhh  
  
It's just another blind (blind) anniversary  
Blind (blind) Anniversary-hehaheyeaahhhhhhh  
  
It's just another blind (blind) anniversary yeah  
Around we go  
Around we go  
Around we go  
Round and round we go  
  
And I want to and you want to  
And you want its happening  
  
And I want to and you want to  
And you no no no no  
  
But maybe that's just me

Lately I can't breathe  
Waiting they're chasing me  
No one listens but I'm OK with it (don't touch me)  
  
Only I wonder why  
If only my hands weren't tied  
The world's a blister  
But I'm OK with it (don't trust me)  
  
What if I was there  
What if I was scared  
I'm waiting for  
They're at my door  
But I'll be back again  
  
Lonely, I'm wandering  
Patrolling for enemies  
No one listens but I'm OK with it

A little white house  
It's everything we've  
Dreamed about  
I wanted you to know  
I'm hanging up my ego  
We shouldn't have to fight  
Or worry about the bills tonight  
I wanted you to know  
I want to be your shadow  
The mystery's gone  
So bring back the sun  
We'll bury this hate  
And build it with love  
The grass wasn't greener  
I found  
I wanted you to know  
I dug you up a rainbow  
I know, I know I failed you  
I hope, I hope we get to  
Sunny days again

You know you're not a strong man  
And you're just about to cry  
Hang on it's all right  
You worry about the future  
The sign said "yoga class for cats"  
It's okay  
The dynamite is waiting  
They bankrupted the sky  
You're frustrated by the cracks in  
The pavement  
And every mother's back  
Once again  
The carnival closed down  
But if this world ever turns around  
You'll be there  
When everyone is sane you'll be there

The telephone is ringing, disconnect the line  
The tension is building but I'm alright  
The stars are colliding, so you might as well let me go  
The television is burning because I set it on fire  
The wheels they keep turning, but I'm fine  
What about the questions we have locked up inside  
Somewhere, somehow  
We've been denied  
Hand in hand we walk behind pretending,  
Defending while our souls are tied  
It's only the third hour, my conscience subsides  
But something reminds me that you lied  
What about the consequences?  
This can't be right

Don't like the direction you are going to  
Seems to lack the attention, that it used to  
Stay out all night and get high with your friends  
Wonder why you don't get one thing done  
Don't like the direction you are going to  
Ahhh la da la da ahhh la da la da  
  
Don't like the direction you have come to  
Now it has the attention that it's used to  
Stay home all night with the tv and wife  
Comfortable life's not all it's cracked up to be  
Don't like the direction you have come to  
  
It's easy to get caught and the weight of the world  
Is falling on your face, so unsure that you...  
Don't like the direction You are going to  
Seems to lack the attention that it's usted to  
Stay out all night and get high woth your friends  
Wonder why you don't get a one thing done  
Don't like the direction you are going to  
Ahhh ahhh  
  
Yeah it's easy to get caught and the weight of the world  
Is falling on your face, so unsure that you...  
Don't like like the direction you are going to  
Seems to lack the attention that it's usted to  
Stay out all night and get high woth your friends  
Wonder why you don't get a one thing done  
Don't like the direction you are going to  
Ahhh ahhh. ..

So you feel that stain of dried up discussions without weight  
It's that feeling you will not have to destroy  
It's that feeling that you will not have to ignore  
The dirty walls  
So you've been plagued, but is everything okay  
I cannot bear the shallow words they throw  
It's that feeling that you will not have to employ  
It's that feeling that you will not  
It's got to go  
This conversation is going nowhere  
It's transparent as fuck  
This conversation must be over  
Because all I see is mud

I crawled out from the pain of yesterday  
I crawled to you and  
I said all the things that you said to say  
Have I said enough?  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
  
I know how you're playin' these dirty games  
They're killing me and  
I know how you love to watch me beg  
So here I am  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't want to be the puppet for you  
I don't want to bite the hand that's feeding  
I don't want to be a sucker for you  
Ah yes, you  
I hate myself for begging  
I hate myself for staying  
I hate myself for listening to, you  
  
It's too little too late, I can't escape  
So I'm begging you please  
I changed all the things that you told me to change  
And now I'm on my knees  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to get out  
Stuck inside of this  
Waiting for something else  
Waiting to exist  
Can you offer me help?  
Help for what I've missed  
I've missed  
I've  
  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah  
Do you like it, yeah yeah, yeah yeah, yeah yeah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For listening to you, ah  
For listening to you, ah  
For listening to you, ah

Last time I talked to you  
You were lonely and out of place  
You were looking down on me  
Lost out in space  
We laid underneath the stars  
Strung out and feeling brave  
I watched the red orange glow  
I watched you float away  
  
Down here in the atmosphere  
Garbage and city lights  
You've gone to save your tired soul  
You've gone to save our lives  
I turned on the radio  
To find you on satellite  
I'm waiting for this sky to fall  
I'm waiting for a sign  
And all we are  
Is all so far  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
Hope you remember me  
When you're homesick and need a change  
I miss your purple hair  
I miss the way you taste  
I know you'll come back someday  
On a bed of nails I'll wait  
I'm praying that you don't burn out  
Or fade away  
And all we are  
Is all so far  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see  
I know you're out there  
Oh  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
You're falling back to me  
The star that I can see, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
You're falling out of reach  
Defying gravity, yeah  
I know you're out there  
Somewhere out there  
  
You're falling back to me  
I know , I know  
You're falling out of reach  
I know

I'm looking for a sign that I can't see  
The good the bad is somewhere in between  
These warning signs, and the servant grinds, me down  
The kids are building fires by their homes  
The smoke is sending signals out in code  
These safety suits, these parachutes  
I don't know  
  
Gotta stop, drop, roll  
  
When all these walls come down  
They'll shake us  
We fight not to be, not to be weightless  
Oh when all these stars hit ground  
They'll wake us  
We fight not to be, not to be weightless  
  
I'm choking on the words that I cant say  
My lungs are full but everything's misplaced  
And these junkyard dogs, these cherry bombs, go off  
The sun, the sky, the moon will fall apart  
Come tumbling down just like a house of cards  
These fire escapes, and this lush landscape, it fades  
  
When all these walls come down  
They'll shake us  
We fight not to be, not to be weightless  
Oh when all these stars hit ground  
They'll wake us  
We fight not to be, not to be weightless  
Weightless  
  
I can feel this heavyweight hanging around my neck  
I can feel your heartbeat bringing me back  
Back again  
  
When all these walls come down  
They'll shake us  
We fight not to be, not to be weightless  
Oh when all these stars hit ground  
They'll wake us  
We fight not to be, not to be weightless  
Be weightless  
Be weightless

Over there well he's wondering  
Is Oskar there is Oskar all right  
Was never cool not allowed to fit  
He never knew what he liked  
Over there he's the rubberman  
A rubber dress with Betty Page eyes  
Was never cool he'll never settle down  
He's not allowed to drive  
He'll build a bridge then walk around  
Don't ever call him dumb he's not that bright  
He's just not himself  
I will take you somewhere  
Somewhere to unwind  
You're tangled up in all this shit  
I will make you mine  
Over there he's a superstar  
A taxi man and a young Einstein

Hope climbs atop of the piano  
Reaching out towards the warmth of the sun  
Some man tries to ask her down  
But now maybe that's where she belongs  
My God she said,  
I'm the sunflower who wants  
My god he said,  
This woman is gone  
Into the dark  
Is there anybody there  
My god she said  
He climbed up top to find that she was slipping  
Let her go, let her go, let me go  
How long must we leave before we're winning  
They don't know, they don't know they just don't know  
If she can't be there I know it's best that  
Nothing is denied  
If she can't be there it's best that  
Everyone change sides

I could be your greatest accident  
I could be the blood on your fingertips  
Nothing's wrong  
Nothing to regret  
Just want to breathe you in  
  
If this is it  
  
I could be your greatest confidant  
And I could be the head laying on your breast  
Just want to breathe you in  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The light, the love, the hope is near  
The weight we're under disappears  
If this is it  
  
I could be your greatest accident  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Imagine there's no heaven  
It's easy if you try  
No hell below us  
Above us only sky  
Imagine all the people living for today  
Imagine there's no countries  
It isn't hard to do  
Nothing to kill or die for  
And no religion too  
Imagine all the people living life in peace  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope some day you will join us  
And the world will be as one  
Imagine no possessions  
I wonder if you can  
No need for greed or hunger  
A brotherhood of man  
Imagine all the people sharing all the world  
You may say I'm a dreamer  
But I'm not the only one  
I hope some day you will join us  
And the world will live as one

Oh, Johnny wishes he was famous  
Spends his time alone in the basement  
With Lennon and Cobain and  
A guitar and a stereo  
  
While he wishes he could escape this  
But it all seems so contagious  
Not to be yourself and faceless  
In a song that has no soul  
  
I remember feeling low  
I remember losing hope  
I remember all the feelings  
And the day they stopped  
  
[Chorus]  
We are  
We are all innocent  
We are all innocent  
We are  
We are [Repeat x2]  
  
Oh, Tina's losing faith in what she knows  
Hates her music, hates all of her clothes  
Thinks of surgery and a new nose  
Every calorie is a war  
  
And while she wishes she was a dancer  
And that she'd never heard of cancer  
She wishes God would give her some answers  
And make her feel beautiful  
  
I remember feeling low  
I remember losing hope  
I remember all the feelings  
And the day they stopped  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One day  
You'll have to let it go  
You'll have to let it go, no  
One day  
You'll stand up on your own  
You'll stand up on your own, yeah  
  
Remember losing hope  
Remember feeling low  
Remember all the feelings  
And the day they stopped  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x2]  
  
(Interwind 2nd chorus and next verse)  
  
One day  
You'll have to let it go  
You'll have to let it go, no  
One day  
You'll stand up on your own  
You'll stand up on your own, yeah  
  
We are  
We are all innocent

I can be anything  
That you want me to be  
A punching bag  
A piece of string, no  
That reminds you not to think  
  
They found the note down in your car  
It's not your fault it gets this hard  
Gets this hard  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold your head high  
Don't look down  
I'm by your side  
I won't back down  
You wanted a hero tonight  
Well I'm not made of steel  
I'm not made of steel  
But your secret's safe with me  
  
I can be anything  
That you want me to be  
A holy cross  
Some sympathy, no  
That reminds you how to bleed  
  
They found the note down in your car  
You climbed up here to fall apart  
Fall apart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, your secret's safe with me  
  
They knock you down  
I'll pick you up  
They laugh at you  
I'll shut them up  
  
But I'm not made of steel [Repeat x4]  
But your secret's safe with me  
Yeah, your secret's safe with me  
Yeah  
  
Hold your head high  
Don't look down  
I'm by your side  
I won't back down  
You wanted a hero tonight

I gave up on you.  
And your exercise  
And the world that I knew  
Then, I fell back on you.  
Cause I need more time  
And I need an excuse  
  
I'm a thief, a liar  
An angel in the fire  
I'm a king, a drug  
The push that comes to shove  
I'm a freak, a star  
I'm everything you are  
I'm your Jesus, I'm your pride  
  
We're made to heal  
  
I depend on you  
For the wings of life  
And the air that you move  
And I defended you  
For this one last time  
For the nerves you abuse.  
  
I'm a thief, a liar  
An angel in the fire  
I'm a king, a drug  
The push that comes to shove  
I'm a freak, a star  
I'm everything you are  
I'm your Jesus, I'm your pride  
  
We're made to heal

Oh, well I woke up in hell today  
I woke up depressed and drained  
But that's OK 'cause I promised  
Not to hurt you again  
And apparently I'm to blame  
But apparently I've been framed  
By a memory that  
Won't help me when its happening  
Out of the mind  
Out of the soul  
Out of the light  
Out of control  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
Until it will be okay  
Well, I promised you I would I change  
But I'm an asshole and I'm ashamed  
And I'm upset 'cause  
I betrayed everything that you gave  
Will you ever let me explain  
Can I beg you to let me stay  
Don't quit me 'cause ill never let this happen  
Out of the mind  
Out of the soul  
Out the light  
Out of control  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
And it'll be okay  
  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
And it'll be okay  
Standing in the middle of yesterday  
Where it all went wrong  
Where we made the mistakes  
I'm sorry for the things I forgot to say  
But it won't be long  
And it'll be okay  
Oh, I want to make it up to you  
Make it up to you  
I'm gonna make it up to you  
Oh, oh  
Oh, I want to make it up to you  
Make it up to you  
I'm gonna make it up to you  
Oh, oh

Sleep  
  
Sleep tonight  
  
And may your dreams  
  
Be realized  
  
If the thunder cloud  
  
Passes rain  
  
So let it rain  
  
Rain down on him  
  
So let it be  
  
So let it be  
  
Sleep  
  
Sleep tonight  
  
And may your dreams  
  
Be realized  
  
If the thundercloud  
  
Passes rain  
  
So let it rain  
  
Let it rain  
  
Rain on him

Cover of Sons of Freedom song  
  
Last night I saw you standing in the rain  
So tired, I must have been dreaming again  
It ain't easy, easy, when you're on your own  
It ain't easy, easy, when you're all alone  
  
I'll revenge you  
I'll revenge you  
I'll find you  
Nobody sees your pain  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
  
Last night I saw you backing up all afraid  
So tired, I must have been dreaming again  
It ain't easy, easy, 2nd Avenue  
It ain't easy, easy, those things you put me through  
  
I'll revenge you  
I'll revenge you  
Revenge you  
I found you  
Nobody sees your pain  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
Just make sure you don't sell your soul  
  
How long now, baby?

Makin' plans for your escape  
Get between all the ricochets  
Assume positions in the sky  
Fly away with the butterflies  
Rest your head in Pacific grove  
Lose yourself down in Mexico  
Wanna taste of the monkey brains  
Take a bite man, don't be shy  
  
[Chorus]  
They're comin' after you!  
They're comin' after you!  
It's all you can do  
They're comin' after you!  
  
Got your file and your DNA  
Membership in the NRA  
On the list with the FBI  
Yearbook pics from the junior high  
Camouflage in your orange and black  
Soar above all the ground attacks  
Safe and sound on this coastal plane  
Celebrate with the cheap champagne  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Generations trying to find a home  
A thousand miles away from what they know  
It's time to go  
  
Generations trying to find a home  
A thousand miles away from what they know  
It's time to go  
  
[Chorus]

Cover of Pixies song played in Texas in 1995  
  
There was a guy  
An under water guy who controlled the sea  
Got killed by ten million pounds of sludge  
From new york and new jersey  
This monkey's gone to heaven  
  
The creature in the sky  
Got sucked in ahole  
Now there's a hole in the sky  
And the ground's not cold  
And if the ground's not cold  
Everything is gonna burn  
We'll all take turns  
I'll get mine, too  
This monkey's gone to haven  
  
Rock me joe!  
  
If man is 5 [3x]  
Then the devil is 6 [5x]  
Then God is 7 [3x]  
This monkey's gone to heaven

Are you there, and is it comfortable?  
Did you want to escape, try to escape the population?  
The pressure is deceiving,  
And for you particularly should we let a young man die?  
Let him die if he wants to?  
I can't live here anymore  
It's hard when you reach for that floor and  
And there's something that tears me inside, so I can't  
Go brother are you there?  
Now tell me is it wonderful  
Or were you hoping to find something a little more?  
Climbing down the hours I need to know now  
Do the hands of time only rule this chapter  
I'll have to try once again, I'll have to try when I want to  
There he's on his knees again  
Trying hard to understand  
Why Naveed would let a young man die  
Convinced that he might break he reaches for that phone  
And then another day has gone

All you people can feel it waiting  
Innocence and love, wrapped in the arms of the burning neon  
I feel it, I feel it  
It's so entertaining and so wonderful  
It magically calls for you  
Big neon crossing show me the way  
Save my soul today  
Don't you worry and don't be afraid  
Does it send you to the world appealing  
Where there is spoken word that I can't take  
So I'm the liar, I'm the liar  
You'd be so disappointed  
To find out that the magic was not  
Really meant for you

She sits quiet  
In the shadow of the sun  
She looks tired  
Her life that's come undone  
She turns, turns, turns, turns  
  
She likes hockey  
And summers by the lake  
We're not talking  
Because of my mistakes  
I burn, burn, burn, burn  
  
[Chorus]  
If you walk out that door  
I just don't know what I'd do  
I'll never get over you  
In my heart  
I just don't know what I'd do  
I'll never get over you  
  
End the silence  
But it's never been so loud  
I try to fight it  
But the words just don't come out  
I burn, burn, burn, burn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's no hiding  
From your silence  
There's no hiding  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you go  
Don't you go  
Don't you go  
Don't you go

Early version of Birdman from Demo  
  
You sit alone, marking time  
Hiding behind disposition  
Birdman wants to get inside of your mind  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right open the blinds  
People, I know you people Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right its all on the outside  
  
Through the cracks you hear it live  
Let's talk about information  
You sit back and criticize, you criticize  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right you give him a ride  
People, I know you people Get it on Get it on Get it on Get it on  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right its all on the outside  
  
This man, a lunatic wants to be right  
To realize one disguise  
But I'm doing fine  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right its all on the outside  
  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right the birdman wouldn't lie  
Nobody's wrong, nobody's right People, I know you people Get it on Get

Lying on the bed I say  
Everybody feels this way  
But anybody else, and me  
And are you worried about the way you know  
You're worried about your fancy clothes  
But anybody else, believe  
  
Not afraid  
I'm not alone  
I'm just hanging on way too long  
Let me out, let me in  
Oh let me stumble when I fall  
You noticed me, I noticed you  
But it's the simple things I feel you knew  
Let me out, let me in, again  
  
And are you worried about how I feel you know  
Funny I've been hit to know  
But anybody else, believe  
And are you going on you know you say  
I'm bleeding blood of yesterday  
But anybody else oh, believe  
  
Not afraid  
I'm not alone  
I'm just hanging on way too long  
Let me out, let me in  
Let me stumble when I fall  
You noticed me, I noticed you  
But it's the feeling that I feel you knew  
Let me out, let me in, again  
  
Let me out, let me in  
Let me know I feel you when  
You wanted more  
You wanted this  
You wanted more  
More more more  
More more more  
More more more  
  
Let me say, Let me know  
Let me feel I know you'd fall  
You wanted more  
You wanted this  
You wanted simple things I miss  
Well again, again  
  
It's like the sky is falling down  
It's like the weigh in the ground  
It's like the sight in the night  
Like the feeling, but I am just alright  
I know, I know, and I know  
  
Not afraid  
I'm not alone  
I'm just a hanging on way too long  
Let me out, let me in  
Let me stumble when I fall  
You noticed me, I noticed you  
But it's the simple things I...  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that I need  
Simple things that...

There's nothing you can say  
Nothing you can do  
There's nothing in between  
You know the truth  
  
Nothing left to face  
There's nothing left to lose  
Nothing takes your place  
  
When they say  
You're not that strong  
You're not that weak  
It's not your fault  
And when you climb up to your hill  
Up to your place  
I hope you're well  
  
There's nothing left to prove  
There's nothing I won't do  
There's nothing like the pain  
I feel for you  
  
Nothing left to hide  
Nothing left to fear  
I am always here  
  
When they say  
You're not that strong  
You're not that weak  
It's not your fault  
And when you climb up to your hill  
Up to your place  
I hope you're well  
  
What you want  
What you lost  
What you had  
What is gone is over  
  
What you got  
What you love  
What you need  
What you have is real  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
It's not enough, I'm sorry  
  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
It's not enough  
  
When they say  
You're not that strong  
You're not that weak  
It's not your fault  
And when you climb up to your hill  
Up to your place  
I hope you're well  
  
It's not enough  
No  
It's not enough  
It's not enough

Take these plastic people  
Read their lips, now let it linger  
Is there anything that makes them sound sincere?  
Tightly hold your hand  
Take a deep breath, give them the finger  
Are you worried  
That your thoughts are not quite clear?  
(Twitch)  
Overlooked, unfit appearance  
  
I remember falling  
I remember marching  
Like a one man army  
Through the blaze  
I know I'm coughing  
I believe in something  
I don't want to remember falling  
For your lies  
  
Unbutton your clothes  
Undress your soul, show them your vigor  
Are those inhibitions easiest to fear?  
Take this gasoline tin  
Head up high, walk like a winner  
Let the bare feet be the last sound that they hear  
  
(Twitch)  
Overlooked, unfit appearance  
  
I remember falling  
I remember marching  
Like a one man army  
Through the blaze  
I know I'm coughing  
I believe in something  
I don't want to remember falling  
For your lies  
  
Falling  
I remember falling  
I remember marching  
Like a one man army  
Through the blaze  
I know I'm coughing  
I believe in something  
I don't want to remember falling

Unreleased rarity played live  
  
Does it have to get me in the morning (in the morning)  
  
Don't believe there's a face that you can't see  
  
Does it stay all alone (alone)  
  
Don't believe, that it's not you, it's not me, it's not hope, not free  
  
It's an ordinary day  
  
Got it, you got it, you got it [?]  
  
Ordinary day  
  
Got it, you got it, you got it [?]  
  
Ordinary, ordinary  
  
(From here on the song is hard to hear but most of it sounds like Raine's just
repeating the beginning.)  
  
High, high [?]  
  
Does it have to get me in the morning (in the morning)  
  
Don't believe you to say that you can't see  
  
Does it wait all alone (alone)  
  
Don't believe, that not you, not me, not hope, not faith

Waiting by the telephone,  
Breathing through a giant rubber hose.  
God only knows  
Photographs of you and me,  
Pictures of the friends,  
You used to know,  
Where did they go?  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't take my picture down  
Don't erase everything that we had.  
Don't think I'd let you down  
I might be gone, but we'll meet again  
Can't find you  
So I'll call your name  
  
Riding on the satellite  
Sun faded and sweaty, but that's all right,  
'Cause I'm still alive  
I'm stranded in this memory,  
Your mouth is wide open, you can't scream  
Oh you can't scream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Please pick up the phone,  
Please pick up the phone,  
Please pick up the phone,  
Please pick up the phone,  
I wanted you to know,  
I wanted you to know,  
I wanted you to know,  
I wanted you to know.  
  
[Chorus]

We live, we die  
I don't know the reasons we ask why  
We hate, we push  
Recent tests show we are all misunderstood  
  
Something's seizing  
You know you lost your mind  
You know we all need saving  
She found you late last night  
You feel the madness gaining  
You know you just can't win  
You know this  
But I'm just so tired of waking up on the ground  
I never knew the girl  
And I never knew the world hurt  
  
We beg, we pray  
But everything still happens anyway  
Something's teasing  
Your conscience can't decide  
She stopped your will from caving  
But left you paranoid  
  
You feel the constant straining  
She reappears divine  
You noticed  
But I'm just so tired of waking up all alone

I picked you up, I held you out.  
I love you. I love you.  
I placed you down, I held my breath.  
I wonder. Yeah, I wonder.  
What'd I do? You're not around.  
  
It's a fall.  
I've got to tell you,  
That this wall, was not meant for you.  
I see sides all, sides all around.  
Get through.  
You'll get through this.  
  
The moon strikes one. You rest your head.  
This refuge, oh this refuge.  
The sun comes up, and life begins.  
There's danger, oh there's danger.  
What'd I do if you weren't around?  
  
It's a fall.  
I've got to tell you,  
That this wall, was not ment for you.  
I see sides all, sides all around.  
You'll get through, you'll get through.  
  
The human condition, needs a hiding place.  
This human condition, needs a hiding place.  
A hiding place.  
  
It's a fall.  
I've got to tell you,  
That this wall, was not meant for you.  
I see sides all, sides all around.  
You'll get through, you'll get through,  
You'll get through, through, you'll get through.

You haven't seen the world outside for days  
You sleep, you hope, you wait  
Imagination disappears  
And all the dreams you have you save  
Confrontation like a mirror  
They try to take your mind away  
  
I don't know, but I believe in yesterday  
And what it means  
To bleed and know that you're okay  
  
Are you waiting?  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what, I'm always right there behind you [Repeat x2]  
  
Bombarded by the atmosphere  
You breath, you choke, you breath again  
Conversation disappears  
You realize they're not your friends  
The panic of the future rears  
You dig, you jerk  
You find another way  
  
I don't know, but I believe in yesterday  
And what it means  
To bleed and know that you're okay  
  
Are you waiting?  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what, I'm always right there behind you  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what, I'm always right there behind you  
  
You open up my veins now I don't feel the same  
No no no  
You open up my brain but I won't be replaced  
  
No matter what you say  
No matter what you do  
No matter what I'm always right there behind you

How do you feel  
How do you hate  
How do you wake up with the smile that's on your face  
Out on the moon  
If I was an astronaut could I get back to you?  
I'm out of my head  
I'm out of excuses so I'm staring at the bed  
And it's you  
It's you  
  
I hold on, I hold on  
(I can't let go)  
And you don't know how I feel  
Hold on, I hold on  
(I'd sell my soul)  
And you don't know how I feel  
  
Losing my heart  
Losing my pride  
I'd burn our initials in the sun if it would shine  
I need a fresh start  
I was in heaven until this one fell apart  
Out on the run  
Out on this empty space since all of this begun  
I try  
I try  
  
I hold on, I hold on  
(I can't let go)  
And you don't know how I feel  
Hold on, I hold on  
(I'd sell my soul)  
And you don't know how I feel  
  
Hold on, hold on  
(I can't let go)  
And you don't how I feel  
  
And nothing seems to help  
And nothing seems to work  
And nothing isn't beautiful  
I'm old enough to take all the blame for all of us  
There's all the games and all the faces  
I'm bleeding by myself and I'm okay  
  
Hold on, I hold on  
(I can't let go)  
And you don't know how I feel  
Hold on, I hold on  
(I'd sell my soul)  
And you don't know how I feel  
  
Hold on, I hold on  
(I can't let go)  
And you don't know how I feel  
I hold on  
(I can't let go)  
And you don't know how I feel

I'm not lookin' for trouble. I'm takin' one in the chin.  
I don't know where I'm goin', or where to begin.  
Alone in this room, thinkin' of you nd what could've been.  
  
The trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble got to me.  
And there's no signs of life in here at all.  
The sound of quiet is defining.  
I'll wait for you to call.  
And there's no sings of life in here at all.  
All the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble, won't get the best of me.  
  
Ah la la la la la  
Ah la la la la la  
Ah la la la la la la  
  
I'm sending you out a signal.  
Over land, over sea.  
From the top of the great lakes, down the Mississippi.  
Alone in the room, thinkin' of you and those possibilities.  
  
The trouble that I've seen.  
This trouble got to me.  
And there's no signs of life in here at all.  
The sound of quiet is defining.  
I'll wait for you to call.  
And there's no signs of life in here at all.  
All the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble.  
Ah the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble won't get the best of me.  
  
There's no signs of life in here at all.  
The sound of quiet is defining.  
I'll wait for you to call.  
There's no signs of life in here at all.  
Ah the trouble that I've seen.  
The trouble.  
Ah the trouble that I've seen.  
And trouble won't get the best of me.

Souls, although where we meet. This  
Hose a lazy Morphine.  
But I, I'm stretching to see over  
Your shoulders and past your priest  
And paper cups and paper shoes  
Give backs to me, but I see right  
through  
And I know why you overslept  
So gray, gray, slow rain.  
  
I'm happier than you.  
And I'm too high to follow through  
Home, like the bedpan he needs.  
And the hose, that's not supposed to be  
But I, I'm stretching to see over your  
Flowers and Time magazines  
Now I believe in what you do  
The pain will cease  
Well I know why you overslept  
To be home, to be

Today's a reason for living  
Today's the blood from a stone  
Today's a light from a candle  
Helping us to find our way home  
  
Today we carry each other  
Today the past is a freak  
Today's a time for forgiveness  
You were never that good to me  
  
(Welcome to this world of mine)  
  
I'm sorry, I can't lie  
I'm wasting too much time  
Drowning I've been blind  
But I've opened up my eyes  
Sorry, I can't lie  
So I just say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Yeah  
  
Today's tasting the honey  
Today's the strike of a match  
And today's the lines in the pavement  
Helping us to find our way back  
Today's the crosses we carry  
Today's the strength that we need  
And today's the hand of an angel  
You were not the kind to believe  
  
(Welcome to this world of mine)  
  
I'm sorry, I can't lie  
I'm wasting too much time  
Drowning I've been blind  
But I've opened up my eyes  
Sorry, I can't lie  
So I just say goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Yeah  
  
Oh what a day, oh what a day, oh my God  
Oh what a day, oh what a day, oh my God  
Oh what a day, oh what a day, oh my God  
And oh my God, and oh my God, yeah  
  
Today we carry each other  
Today we do what we should  
Today's a time for forgiving  
Today I wish I could  
  
I'm sorry, I can't lie  
I'm wasting too much time  
Drowning, I've been blind  
But I've opened up my eyes  
Sorry, I can't lie  
So I just say goodbye, goodbye, goodbye  
Another bye, goodbye, goodbye  
Another bye, goodbye, goodbye, yeah  
Another bye, goodbye, goodbye  
Another bye, goodbye, bye

I let go of the world that was holding  
A passenger that could not fly  
In search of souls  
Souls in search of something  
Let it go  
Let it slide  
When I find out what went on  
I'll bring it back  
It won't be easy  
They won't believe how a man  
He could drown  
In a starseed  
I hoped to find why this world wasn't glowing  
Glowing it darkens as we end this ride  
I've fallen back under the equator  
I'm back inside, I'm back inside  
When I find out what went on  
I'll bring it back but it won't be easy  
They won't believe the man he could  
But I'd choose starseed over nothing  
Nothing

Do you worry that you're not liked  
How long till you break  
You're happy cause you smile  
But how much can you fake  
An ordinary boy an ordinary name  
But ordinary's just not good enough today  
  
Alone I'm thinking  
Why is superman dead  
Is it in my head  
We'll just laugh instead  
  
You worry about the weather and  
Whether or not you should hate  
Are you worried about your faith  
Kneel down and obey  
You're happy you're in love  
You need someone to hate  
An ordinary girl an ordinary waist  
But ordinary's just not good enough today  
  
Alone I'm thinking  
Why is superman dead  
Is it in my head  
We'll just laugh instead  
  
Doesn't anybody ever know that the world's a subway

I've read the bible, I've read Dylan,  
I'm reading people now  
Because it is much more chilling  
I sit on a satellite  
With the stars made of gold  
There's life through that hollow lens  
I know supersatellite  
I watch the traffic,  
I find the seeds  
There's one man in particular  
Who's not what he seems  
I can't focus in  
On the lies in his head  
He's convinced that his blood is blue  
But it's red  
Supersatellite  
Nothing dazzles me,  
I am in his dreams  
Nothing is shocking,  
Transparent human being  
On the soul inside the world  
Far better than the eye inside the mind  
Fuck you, I am you, you hear me  
Stop crying, stop crying
