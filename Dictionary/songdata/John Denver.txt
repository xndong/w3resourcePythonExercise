African sunrise, shine on a brand new day  
African sunrise, show us a brand new way  
Give us a brand new morning  
Show us forever beginning to stand on our own  
African sunrise, smile on my African home  
  
In this hour of quiet contemplation  
The stillness of the dawning calms my mind  
I face the day with heartfelt exaltation  
The light is both a promise and a sign  
  
In the darkness we have lost the son of our sister  
Though the beauty of his spirit lingers still  
This was a child of love, a child of laughter  
Who cannot understand the way I feel  
  
Is it not the sun that gives the seasons  
Is it not the sun that brings the rain  
Our throats are choled with dust, but we're still singing  
Our song will not be silenced by the rain  
  
All around the village I could hear the roosters crowing  
There was a time it was like music to my ears  
Now all I can hear is the sound of hungry babies crying  
I pray for rain to wash away their tears  
  
African sunrise, light of a brand new day  
African sunrise, light of a brand new way  
With one who will be our brother  
And one who will be our partner and teach us to know  
  
African sunrise, smile on my African home  
African sunrise...  
African sunrise...

When I was a child and I lived in the city  
I dreamed of Alaska so far away  
And I dreamed I was flying over mountains and glaciers  
Somehow I knew that I'd live there one day  
  
Well it took me some growin' and a fair bit of schoolin'  
And a little bit of trouble to get on the move  
And I felt like a loser but I turned out the winner  
When I came to Alaska the land that I love  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
I was born in a cabin on little Mulchatna  
Raised in hard times but I had a good life  
From the first time I flew with my father a singin'  
I knew that I'd wind up a bush pilot's wife.  
  
We sleep near the sound of a slow running river  
And wake up most mornings to a drizzling rain  
And we live every day like the first or the last one  
With nothing to lose and heaven to gain.  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
Oh, for a fire on a cold winter's night  
Once more to gaze at the great northern lights  
For all of the beauty my children will see  
Here's to Alaska and me.  
  
Here's to Alaska, here's to the people  
Here's to the wild and here's to the free  
Here's to my life in a chosen country  
Here's to Alaska and me  
Oh, here's to Alaska and me

All of my memories lay in the life of the highway  
All of my nights in old motels and sleeping alone  
All of my days on the road with no one beside me  
All of my dreams of a place that I can call home  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere in the shade near the sound of a sweet singin' river  
Somewhere in the sun where the mountains make love to the sky  
Somewhere to build me a faith, a farm and a family  
Somewhere to grow older, and somewhere a reason to try  
  
Cause I'm tired of big cities and so tired of big city ways  
Scratchin' off sunsets, and walkin' around in the maze  
Some sweet taxi dancer's tryin' to save me from bein' alone  
Ah, it's much worse than lonely, there is no place that I really belong  
I want to be home  
  
I'm leavin' this city life In my mind I'm flyin' away  
I'm leavin' tomorrow and all of the old yesterdays  
I'm leavin' the trash cans, the bright lights, the telephone lines  
I'm leavin' my sorrows and all of my memories behind  
To see what I find  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somewhere to grow older, somewhere to lay down and die

All this joy, all this sorrow  
All this promise, all this pain  
Such is life, such is being  
Such is spirit, such is love  
  
City of joy, city of sorrow  
City of promise, city of pain  
Such is life, such is being  
Such is spirit, such is love  
  
World of joy, world of sorrow  
World of promise, world of pain  
Such is life, such is being  
Such is spirit, such is love  
  
All this joy, all this sorrow  
All this promise, all this pain  
Such is life, such is being  
Such is spirit, such is love  
Such is spirit, such is love

I had a '56 t-bird  
Then i was king of the highway  
Trying to make it look fast and easy  
And dreamin' of doin' it my way  
Let's put the top down baby  
Feel the wind in our hair  
  
We were too young to know better  
And too cool to care  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride  
  
Rock and roll on the radio  
Let's turn it up and get down  
  
Convertible dreams running wild in the streets  
In the all time american town  
When you played the thrill queen, baby  
I heard the jazz of joy  
You were every girl in the world  
But i wasn't every boy  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby, you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride  
  
Memory pink and charcoal grey  
Are the clours i painted this song  
You were 19 and perfect, baby  
But no one stays perfect too long  
  
All i wanted was you by my side  
Baby you're only along for the ride  
Only along for the ride

There is a river that runs from the mountains  
That one river is all rivers  
All rivers are that one  
  
There is a tree that stands in the forest  
That one tree is all forests  
All trees are that one  
  
There is a flower that blooms in the desert  
That one blossom is all flowers  
All flowers are that one  
  
There is a bird that sings in the jungle  
That one song is all music  
All songs are that one  
  
It is the song of life  
It is the flower of faith  
It is the tree of temptation  
It is the river of no regret  
  
There is a child that cries in the ghetto  
That one child is all children  
All children are that one  
  
There is a vision that shines in the darkness  
That one vision is all of our dreams  
  
It is a vision of heaven  
It is a child of promise  
It is the song of life  
It is the river of no regret  
  
Let this be a voice for the mountains  
Let this be a voice for the river  
Let this be a voice for the forest  
Let this be a voice for the flowers  
Let this be a voice for the ocean  
Let this be a voice for the desert  
Let this be a voice for the children  
Let this be a voice for the dreamers  
Let this be a voice of no regret

Going up to Alaska  
Up to the land of the midnight sun  
Where the whale and the polar bear run  
O'er the icy blue sea  
  
Going up to Alaska  
Up to the north and the pioneer life  
Where courage and strength still survive  
And a man can be free  
  
American Child, does the call of the wild  
Ever sing through the mist of your dreams  
Does it fly with the wind when you waken again  
When it's gone do you know what it means  
  
Can you picture the time when a man had to find  
His own way through the cold  
To come back again to all that you've been  
Can't you see that it's time to come home  
  
To the flowers and seas and the rivers and the trees  
And the earth who's the mother of all  
A promise once made - will it shine, will it fade  
Will we rise with the vision or fall  
  
Going up to Alaska  
Up to the land of the midnight sun  
Where the whale and the polar bear run  
O'er the icy blue sea  
  
Going up to Alaska  
Up to the north and the pioneer life  
Where courage and strength still survive  
And a man can be free  
  
Men can be free  
Going up to Alaska  
Going up to Alaska  
Going up to Alaska

In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sings  
Of the dreams that he brings from the wide open sea.  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who sleeps  
While the river bank weeps to the old willow tree.  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who dies  
Full of beer, full of cries in a drunkin' down fight.  
But in the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who's born  
On a muggy, hot morn by the dawns early light.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam where the sailors all meet  
There's a sailor who eats only fish-heads and tails.  
He will show you his teeth that have rotted too soon.  
That can swallow the moon that can haul up the sails.  
And he asks to the cook with his arms open wide.  
Bring me more fish, put it down by my side.  
And he wants so to belch, but he's too full to try.  
So he gets up and he laughs and he zips up his fly.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam you can see sailors dance.  
Haunches bursting their pants, binding woman to paunch.  
They've forgotten the tune that their whiskey voice croaks.  
And they're aplitting the night with the roar of their jokes.  
And they turn and they dance and they laugh and they lust.  
To the rats it sounds of the accordion burst.  
Then it's out into the night with their pride in their pants.  
With a slut that they tow underneath the street lamps.  
  
In the port of Amsterdam there's a sailor who drinks.  
And he drinks and he drinks and he drinks once again.  
He drinks to the health of the whores of Amsterdam.  
Who have promised their love to a thousand other men.  
And they darken their bodies and their virtue long gone  
For a few dirty coins. And then when he can't go on  
He plants his nose in the sky And he wipes it up above  
And he splits like I cry for an unfaithful love.  
In the port of Amsterdam.  
In the port of Amsterdam.  
In the port of Amsterdam.  

Two days before the moon was round  
You felt the urge of sun's light beams  
The muffled world of dolphin sound  
Slipped down and back into your dreams  
  
For nine full months that passed before  
You learned of all of life's ancient rhymes  
Then mother sensed a farther shore  
And brought you forth into these times  
  
So taste the air of your new world  
And gently guide us to your mind  
It knows the winds and sails unfurled  
And holds to heart the dolphin kind  
  
Welcome precious earth made child  
We met you first in your father's songs  
And mother's smile and waters wild  
It's in this place you now belong  
  
I know you know of all these things  
And feel the faith of a dolphin's sigh  
For you were born on silver wings  
To taste the high blown crystal sky  
  
To sing one day to all of us  
The songs you learned in dolphin lair  
Giving hope to life as all we must  
And teach us how their grace to share

A mansion on a hill is a lovely sight to see  
But like any other house it's only temporary  
Home is anywhere you choose to put your heart  
If there's no love inside, it will soon fall apart  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Buildings will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love  
  
You can drive around in a long limousine  
If you don't know where you're going, it don't mean a thing  
He who'd walk a mile just to hold an empty hand  
Knows what it means to be a wealthy man  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Palaces will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love  
  
Worldly treasures will all pass away  
There's just one thing that was put here to stay  
  
Ashes to ashes, dust into dust  
Kingdoms will crumble, bridges will rust  
Mountains will disappear, rivers will dry up  
And so it goes with everything but love

See the sun rise  
Open up your eyes  
Today is the very first day  
Watch the morning come  
Now the night is gone  
Yesterday is so very far away  
Trouble, you get out of my sight  
You know I can't look at you when the sun is so bright  
You know everything's coming together now  
Can't you see  
  
And I live my life in cel-e-bra-tion  
That I've got a life to live  
And I sing my song in rev-e-la-tion  
That I've got a song that I can give to you  
And you know I do  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la  
  
I was blind but, now I can see  
You know, I'm just learning how it feels to be free  
You know I never really knew just what it could be before  
  
And I live my life in cel-e-bra-tion  
That I've got a life to live  
And I sing my song in rev-e-la-tion  
That I've got a song that I can give to you  
And you know I do and you know it's true.  
  
La la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la

See the sunlight through the pine  
Taste the warm of winter wine  
Dream of softly falling snow  
Winterskol Aspenglow  
  
As the winter days unfold  
Hearts grow warmer with the cold  
Peace of mind is all you know  
Winterskol Aspenglow  
  
Aspen is a life to live  
See how much there is to give  
See how strongly you believe  
See how much you may receive  
  
Smiling faces all around  
Laughter is the only sound  
Memories that can't grow old  
Winterskol Aspenglow  
  
Aspen is a life to live  
See how much there is to give  
See how strongly you believe  
See how much you may receive  
  
See the sunlight through the pine  
Taste the warm of winter wine  
Dream of softly falling snow  
Winterskol Aspenglow

Here I am closing my eyes again  
Tryin' so hard not to see all the things that I see  
Almost willing to lie again  
I swear that it just isn't so, it just isn't me  
We are never alone, even though we'd like to be  
Then I go and open my eyes again  
Love in your eyes is the thing that I'd most like to see  
I'd be willing to die again  
to know of a place and a time that it always will be  
  
Chorus: This is my autograph  
Here in the songs that I sing  
Here in My cry and my laugh  
Here in the love that I bring  
To be always with you  
And you always with me  
  
Say a prayer and open your heart again  
you are the ove and the light that we all need to see  
always willin' to shine and then  
Peace on this Earth is the way that it always can be  
  
Chorus

I've been out on this highway now  
Five days in a row  
My words all run together  
My feet are moving slow  
I've got to stop and eat  
While it's still light  
There's a local angel sitting on my right  
Do you believe in love at first sight  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
I'm ordinarily very shy  
And I'd be polite if I had time  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
Tomorrow, I'll be good and gone  
Please don't make me wait that long  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
I get off at eleven, she said  
And walked away  
She poured a cup of coffee and  
She brought it on a tray  
She said, "it would be nice if you could stay  
You're the best idea I've had all day."  
Usually I put up a fight but  
Baby, you look good to me tonight.  
  
Well I'm ordinarily very shy  
But I grinned at her as I ate my pie  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I thought I must be in a dream  
When she asked me if I wanted cream  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
  
All in all you know  
It's not a bad life on the road  
If you've got wheels to roll  
And lucky stars above  
Your destiny's your own  
You go as far as you can go  
And if there's time to sleep  
There's time to make love  
  
I came, I saw, I conquered  
But I rode off in the sun  
But I know the look she left with me  
Keeps telling me she won  
Her face is the only thing I see  
Whispering those words of prophesy  
  
I may come easy, but I don't come free  
You're never gonna see the last of me  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I was born to love you now can't you see  
Baby, you look good to me tonight  
I'm ordinarily very shy  
But I take the time to satisfy  
Baby, you look good to me tonight

Five hundred will buy you a stack  
Bet it on the red or the black and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
You tell me you are a gambling man  
Try to beat the house if you can and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
If you're looking to get an inside slant  
If you're looking for something so good you can't refuse  
Bet on the blues  
Find a man who thinks he's over the hump  
And I'm here to tell you he's a kind of a chump, you can use  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Lucky old sun is shining today  
Even money says you'll be paying some dues  
Bet on the blues  
You say you found your lady fair  
Eight to five says she's wearing her traveling shoes  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues, bet on the blues  
Five hundred will buy you a stack  
Bet it all on the red or the black and you lose  
Bet on the blues  
If you're looking to get an inside slant  
If you're looking for something so good, you can't refuse  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
Bet on the blues  
You better, bet on the blues  

Packed up all my cares and woes  
Here I go soft and low  
Bye, bye, black bird singing in the dead of night.  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arise  
  
Black bird sing in the dead of night  
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see  
All your life, your were only waiting for this moment to be free  
Black bird fly, Black bird fly  
Into the light of the black dark night  
  
Black bird fly, black bird fly  
Into the light of the dark black  
  
Black bird singing in the dead of night  
Take these broken wings and learn to fly  
All your life, you were only waiting for this moment to arrive  
  
Make my bed, and light the light I'll be home late tonight  
Black bird, bye, bye

She was a levelheaded dancer on the road to alcohol,  
I was just a soldier on my way to Montreal.  
Well, she pressed her chest against me about the time the jukebox broke.  
She gave me a peck on the back of the neck, and these are the words she spoke.  
  
Blow up your tv, throw away your paper, go to the country, build you a home.  
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, try and find Jesus on your own.  
  
I sat there at the table, and I acted real naive.  
Cause I knew that topless lady, she had something up her sleeve.  
She danced around the room awhile and she did the hoochy coo.  
Yeah, singing a song all night long, telling me what to do.  
  
Blow up your tv, throw away your paper, go to the country, build you a home.  
Plant a little garden, eat a lot of peaches, try and find Jesus on your own.  
  
Well, I was young and hungry, and about to leave that place.  
Just as I was going. She looked me in the face.  
I said "You must know the answer," she said "No, but I'll give it a try."  
To this day we've been living our way, here is the reason why.  
  
We blew up your tv, threw away your paper, went to the country, build us a
home.  
Had a lot of children, fed 'em on peaches, they all found Jesus on their own.

I'll have a blue Christmas without you,  
I'll be so blue thinking about you.  
Decorations of red  
On a green Christmas tree  
Just won't mean a thing if  
You're not here with me  
  
And when those blue heartaches start hurting,  
I'll have some blue memories for certain,  
You'll be doing all right  
With your Christmas of white,  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.  
  
Decorations of red  
On a green Christmas tree  
Just won't mean a thing if  
You're not here with me  
  
And when those blue heartaches start hurting,  
I'll have some blue blue memories for certain,  
You'll be doing all right  
With your Christmas of white,  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.  
Yes I'll have a blue, blue Christmas.

Because he called the forest brother  
Because he called the earth his mother  
They drove him out into the rain  
Some people even said the boy from the country was insane  
  
Because he spoke with fish in the creek  
He tried to tell us that the animals could speak  
Who knows, perhaps they do  
How do you know they don't  
Just because they've never spoken to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Boy from the country, he left his home when he was young  
Boy from the country, he loves the sun  
  
He tried to tell us that we should love the land  
We turned our heads and laughed  
And we did not understand  
Sometimes I think that the boy from the country  
Is the only one who sees  
Because the boy from the country  
Doesn't want to see the forest for the trees  
  
[Chorus]

This song appears on three albums, and was first released on the Higher Ground

As we go marching, marching  
In the beauty of the day  
A million darkened kitchens  
A thousand mill lofts grey  
Are touched with all the radiance  
That a sudden sun discloses  
For the people hear us singing  
Bread and roses, bread and roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We battle too for men  
For they are women's children  
And we mother them again  
Our lives shall not be sweetened  
From birth until life closes  
Hearts starve as well as bodies  
Give us bread, but give us roses  
  
As we go marching, marching  
We bring the greater days  
For the rising of the women  
Means the rising of the race  
No more the drudge and idler  
Ten that toil where one reposes  
But the sharing of life's glories  
Bread and roses, bread and roses  
  
Words by James Oppenheim (1912), music by John Denver

The sun is slowly fading in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again  
  
There's a heavy fog between me and the mountains  
It's enough to make a grown man sit and cry  
It's enough to make you wonder  
It's enough to make the world roll up and die  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way the people work with their machines  
Serenity's a long time coming to me  
In fact I don't believe I know what it means  
  
In the east a shaded moon is hanging lazily  
I do believe I saw the old man smile  
I do believe I did  
I do believe he's been laughing all the while  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way the people work with their machines  
Serenity's a long time coming to me  
In fact I don't believe I know what it means  
Anymore  
  
The sun is slowly fading in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again  
The sun again, sun again woo oo oo.

To sail on a dream on a crystal clear ocean,  
To ride on the crest of a wild raging storm  
To work in the service of life and living,  
In search of the answers of questions unknown  
To be part of the movement and part of the growing,  
Part of beginning to understand,  
  
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,  
The things that you've shown us,  
The stories you tell  
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,  
The men who have served you so long and so well  
  
Hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh  
Oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee  
Doo-dle ay ee  
  
Like the dolphin who guides you, you bring us beside you  
To light up the darkness and show us the way  
For though we are strangers in your silent world  
To live on the land we must learn from the sea  
To be true as the tide and free as a wind swell  
Joyful and loving in letting it be  
  
Aye Calypso the places you've been to,  
The things that you've shown us,  
The stories you tell  
Aye Calypso, I sing to your spirit,  
The men who have served you so long and so well  
  
Hi dee ay-ee ooo doo-dle oh  
Oo do do do do do doo-dle ay yee  
Doo-dle ay ee  
  
He dee Ay-ee  
Hi dee oh ooo  
Hi dee ayee  
Hi dee oh ooo

Casey joins the hollow sound of silent people walkin'  
Down the stairway to the subway in the shadows down below  
Following their footsteps through the neon darkened coridors  
Of silent desperation, never speakin' to a soul  
  
The poison air he's breathin' has the dirty smell of dyin'  
'Cause it's never seen the sunshine and it's never felt the rain  
But Casey minds the arrows and ignores the fatal echoes  
Of the clickin' of the turnstile and the rattle of his chains  
  
"Oh", she said "Casey it's been so long since I've seen you"  
"Here" she said, "Just a kiss to make a body smile"  
"See" she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey can you only stay awhile"  
  
Casey leaves the underground and stops inside the Golden Crown  
For somethin' wet to wipe away the chill that's on his bones  
See'ing his reflection in the lives of all the lonely men  
Who reach for anything they can to keep from going home  
  
Standing in the corner, Casey drinks his pint of bitter,  
Never glancing in the mirror at the people passing by  
Then he stumbles as he's leavin' and he wonders if the reason  
Is the beer that's in his belly or the tear that's in his eye  
  
"Oh" she said, "I suppose you seldom think about me"  
"Now" she said, "Now that you've a family of your own"  
"Still" she said, "It's so blessed good to feel your body"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey, it's a shame to be alone"  
  
"Oh" she said, "Casey, it's been so long since I've seen you"  
"Here" she said "Just a kiss to make a body smile"  
"See" she said, "I've put on new stockings just to please you"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey, can you only stay a while"  
"Lord" she said, "Casey it's a shame to be alone"

Do you remember days  
Not so very long ago  
When the world was run by  
People twice your size  
And the days were full of laughter  
  
And the nights were full of stars  
And when you grew tired you  
Could close your eyes  
Yes the stars were were there for wishing  
And the wind was there for kites  
And the morning sun was  
There for rise and shine  
And even in the sniffles  
Kept you home from school in bed  
You couldn't hardly  
Stay there after nine  
  
And I wonder if the  
Smell of mornings faded  
  
What happened to the robins  
Song that sparkled in the sky  
Where's all the water gone  
That tumbled down the stream  
Will I ever catch another butterfly  
  
Right in your own backyard  
Wondering how airplanes could fly  
And the hours spent just playing  
With a funny rock you found  
With crystal specks as  
Blue as all the sky  
  
Now I watch my son  
He's playing with his toys  
He's happy and I  
Give him all I can  
But I can't help feeling  
Just a lime inside  
When to hear him say  
He wants to be a man

A heritage of vision  
Was given to us all  
To smell the rose's fragrance  
To hear the songbird's call  
To watch the distant moonlight fill  
The coming of the tides  
To understand that life is more  
Than always choosing sides  
  
And some have seen what can be seen  
Of sailing ships and kings  
And some are given feet of clay  
And some are given wings  
And some must struggle just to breathe  
Some have a golden spoon  
And some will never leave the nest  
While some walk on the moon  
  
And don't you know the life that lives  
Within the silent hills  
Is just as rich and beautiful  
And just as unfulfilled  
As man with all his intellect  
His reason and his choice  
Oh, who's to say the nightingale  
Has any less a voice  
  
The silver dolphins twist and dance  
And sing to one another  
The cosmic ocean knows no bounds  
For all that lives are brothers  
The whippoorwill, the grizzly bear  
The elephant, the whale  
All children of the universe  
All weavers of the tale  
  
So palomino lie back down  
And dream yourself to sleep  
The hawk flies with the morning dove  
The lion with the sheep  
As far away as you may go  
We'll never be apart  
It's in your dreams that you will know  
The seasons of the heart

Tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day,  
Driving the cattle over snow covered plains.  
All of the good gifts given today,  
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.  
  
Back in the cities they have different ways,  
Football and eggnog and Christmas parades.  
I'll take my blanket, I'll take the reins,  
It's Christmas for cowboys, wide open plains.  
  
A campfire for warmth as we stop for the night,  
The stars overhead are Christmas tree lights.  
The wind sings a hymn as we bow down to pray,  
It's Christmas for cowboys and wide open plains.  
  
It's tall in the saddle we spend Christmas Day,  
Driving the cattle over snow covered plains.  
So many gifts have been opened today,  
Ours is the sky and the wide open range.  
  
It's Christmas for cowboys, wide open plains.

Riding on the City of New Orleans  
Illinois Central, Monday morning rail  
Fifteen cars and fifteen restless riders  
Three conductors and twenty-five sacks of mail  
All along a southbound odyssey  
The train pulls out of Kankakee  
Rolls along past houses, farms and fields  
Passin' towns that have no name  
Freight yards full of old black men  
The graveyards of the rusted automobiles  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying, don't you know me I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Dealing cards with the old men in the club car  
Penny a point, ain't no one keeping score  
Pass the paper bag that holds the bottle  
Feel the wheels a rumbling beneath the floor  
  
And the sons of Pullman porters  
And the sons of engineers  
Ride their fathers' magic carpet made of steel  
And mothers with their babes asleep  
Rockin' to the gentle beat  
And the rhythm of the rails is all they feel  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done  
  
Night time on the City of New Orleans  
Changing cars in Memphis, Tennessee  
Halfway home and we'll be there by morning  
Through the Mississippi darkness rolling down to the sea  
But all the towns and people seem  
To fade into a bad dream  
And the steel rails still ain't heard the news  
The conductor sings his song again  
The passengers will please refrain  
This train has got the disappearing railroad blues  
  
Singing good morning America, how are you?  
Saying don't you know me, I'm your native son?  
I'm the train they call the City of New Orleans  
I'll be gone 500 miles when the day is done

Oh, Oh Claudette  
Oh, Oh Claudette  
  
I got a brand new baby and I feel so good  
She loves me better than I thought she would  
I'm on my way to her house and I'm all out of breath  
And when I see her tonight I'm gonna squeeze her to death  
  
[chorus]  
  
Claudette  
Pretty little pet, Claudette  
Never let me fret, Claudette  
Well she's the prettiest little girl that I have ever met  
I get the best lovin' that I'll ever get, from Claudette  
Oh, oh Claudette  
  
Well I'm a lucky man - my baby treats me right  
She's gonna let me hug and kiss and hold her tight  
When the date is over and I'm at her front door  
And when I kiss her goodnight I holler more, more, more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When me and my new baby have a date or three  
I'm gonna ask my baby if she'll marry me  
I'm gonna be so happy for the rest of my life  
When my brand new baby is my brand new wife  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mmm, mmm Claudette  
Oh, oh Claudette  
Mmm, mmm Claudette

Lullay, thou little tiny child, by, by, lully, lullay.  
Lullay, thou little tiny child, by, by, lully, lullay.  
O sisters too, how may we do, for to preserve this day,  
This poor youngling for whom we sing, by, by, lully, lullay.  
  
Herod the king in his regime charged he hath this day,  
His men of night, in his own sight, all children young to slay.  
Then woe is me, poor child, for thee, and ever mourn and say,  
For thy parting not say, nor sing, by, by, lully, lullay.

Played a wedding for the money and I wish I could have told the bride and
groom  
Just what I think of marriage, what's in store after the honeymoon.  
I was rumbling through the verses about how men and women ought to live apart,  
How a promise never made could not be broken and would never break a heart.  
  
Suddenly from out of nowhere this little girl came spinning across the floor  
Her crinolines were billowing beneath the skirt of calico she wore.  
As her joy fell on the honored guests each one of them was drawn into her
dream  
And they laughed and stamped and clapped their hands and hollered at her,
dance little jean!  
  
They said:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.  
  
Well this cynic's heart just melted as I figured what this get together meant  
And how it ended years of tears and sad confusions that the little girl had
spent.  
They told the band to pack it up about the time the couple cut the cake  
But we stayed and we played all night long for love and laughs and little
jeanie's sake  
  
We played:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.  
  
We sang:  
Dance little jean, this day is for you,  
Two people that you love stood up to say 'i do.'  
Dance little jean, the prayer that you had was answered today-  
Your momma's marrying your dad.

Everybody's got the dancin' fever  
Everbody'd love to rock and roll  
Play it loud and baby play it better  
Funky music gotta stretch your soul  
  
Just relax and let the rhythm take you  
Don't you be afraid to lose control  
If your heart has found some empty spaces  
Dancin's just a thing to make you whole  
  
I am one who dances with the mountains  
I am one who dances with the wind  
I am one who dances on the ocean  
My partner's more than pieces more than friends  
  
Were you there the night they lost the lightning  
Were you there the day the earth stood still  
Did you see the famous and the fighting  
Did you hear the prophet tell his tale  
  
We are one when dancing with the mountains  
We are one when singing in the wind  
We are one when thinking of each other  
More than partners much more than pieces more than friends  
  
Words and music by John Denver

Yes I've been dreaming about you every day  
Each and every day  
Had I been thinking about you all night long  
I even wrote a song  
  
Just to try to tell you how I really feel  
To make you understand my love is real  
That you're on my mind all the time  
I wish to God you were mine once again  
  
I remember talking to you  
I remember walking with you  
I remember laughing all the time  
And you were mine  
Now the days seem so long  
I can't face a night alone  
I beg you please won't you please come home  
  
I remember talking to you  
I remember walking with you  
I remember laughing all the time  
  
I remember singing to you  
I remember dreaming with you  
I remember loving you alone  
And now the days seem so long  
I can't face a night all alone  
I beg you please won't you please come home

I like to deal with the ladies  
I like to give 'em a real hard time  
Like to make 'em sigh  
Like to make 'em cry over me  
I like to swing with the good times  
I like to have me a real live ball  
Doing what I can like a dirty old man  
  
Like to have 'em just hanging around  
Wondering where I've been  
Like to see 'em with their big brown eyes  
Just a drinking me in  
  
I like to deal with the ladies  
I like to hang em up on my line  
Treat 'em kinda rough  
But they never got enough of me  
Rat a tat tat tat tat

Dearest Esmeralda, in another age  
Antiques would be modern, we would be the rage  
Silk would be in fashion, we would dress in lace  
Love would be the passion and the saving grace  
  
I slept one rainy night with you in Paris  
Made up for a thousand wasted years  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
I close my eyes and you make love appear  
  
Dancing in the shimmer of a crystal chandelier  
Shadows singing so low only we could hear  
Moving to the glimmer, shaking to the storm  
Outside it was raging, but inside it was warm  
  
We said goodnight in the candlelight and thunder  
Now I wake and find you're never there  
I'm becoming old enough to wonder  
Happy that I'm still too young to care  
  
Masterpieces crumble, empires tumble down  
Refugees and fantasies go underground  
Romance lasts forever, love don't fade away  
They may take our future, but they don't stop yesterday  
  
Cause somewhere in the cloudy skies of Paris  
we were part of some artist's design  
Dearest Esmeralda, you are magic  
In the gray around me how you shine  
  
Oh oh, how you shine

I caught a ride on the Dreamland Express last night  
I was sailing on an ocean of blue  
And right there by my side, much to my surprise, was you  
  
I said, come on over baby, let me look in your eyes  
Let me see the very heart of you  
And I couldn't believe it, or conceive that my dream would come true  
  
'Cause you said, hey there sweet daddy, everything is alright  
You know for miles there's not a telephone line  
There's not a soul to disturb us  
Just come and be mine  
  
You said, let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love, oh  
Let me be the one that you love  
  
But now it's four in the mornin', I can't sleep  
I can't seem to get you out of my mind  
I keep tossin' and turnin', I'm yearnin' for the sun to shine  
  
I'd like to send you a ticket on the Dreamland Express  
And take you far away with me  
I've got a vision of heaven, you livin' there with me  
  
Let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love, oh, oh  
Let me be the one that you love  
  
Let me be the end of your rainbow  
Let me be the stars up above  
Let me be the one that you long for baby  
Let me be the one that you love, oh  
Let me be the one that you love

If I had my druthers I'd go fishing  
Find myself a lake and a lazy day  
If I had my druthers I'd quit wishing  
Get off the old caboose get on my way  
  
Give me, whole lots of laughter  
Great big barrels of fun  
Nighttime full of romance  
Daytime full of fun  
  
If I had my druthers I'd go flying  
Looking for the things I'd like to see  
If I had my druthers I'd be trying trying  
The only way to be what I can't be  
  
Give me somebody to love me  
Make me feel like the only one  
Something that's worth doing more  
I feel good when it's worked  
  
If I had my druthers I'd go sailing - yes I would  
Catch me camping out on the open sea  
If I had my druthers I'd be singing  
Just how good this good life feels to me - feels so good  
  
It just needs someone to talk to  
Something you can't share  
You don't need no reason for living long  
It's already there - yes it is - ooh ooh  
  
It makes me giggle  
I can't sit down

This song was first released on the Rocky Mountain Holiday Album. It is the
only album it has been released on.  
  
  
You know I love the trail I'm on  
And the friends who ride with me  
The country that we're passing through  
Is a paradise to see  
A haven for my spirit  
The homeland of my dreams  
My heart flies through the wilderness  
And on an eagle's wings  
And oh I love the waterfall  
And the way the river sings  
From snowcapped peaks both proud and tall  
Through forests deep and green  
The highway of the mountains  
The lifeblood of the land  
I can hear my mother speak to me  
And hold my father's hand  
  
Durango mountain caballero  
Take me for a ride  
On the backbone of this mighty land  
The continental divide  
To the place where earth and heaven meet  
The mountains and the sky  
In the heart of Colorado  
Rocky mountain high  
And oh I love the campfire  
And the circle that I'm in  
The stories and the laughter  
They should never ever end  
Forever in my memory  
Forever in my song  
On a San Juan mountain trail ride  
I'll carry you along  
  
Words and music by John Denver

Horses are creatures who worship the earth  
They gallop on feet of ivory  
Constrained by the wonder of dying and birth  
The horses still run they are free  
My body is merely the shell of my soul  
But the flesh must be given its due  
Like a pony that carries its rider back home  
Like an old friend that's tried and been true  
  
I had a vision of eagles and horses  
High on a ridge in a race with the wind  
Going higher and higher and faster and faster  
On eagles and horses I'm flying again,  
  
Eagles inhabit the heavenly heigths  
They know neither limit nor bound  
They're the guardian angels of darkness and light  
They see all and hear every sound  
My spirit will never be broken or caught  
For the soul is a free-flying thing  
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought  
To rise up on glorious wings  
  
I had a vision of eagles and horses  
High on a ridge in a race with the wind  
Going higher and higher and faster and faster  
On eagles and horses I'm flying again,  
I'm flying again, I'm flying again  
  
My body is merely the shell of my soul  
But the flesh must be given its due  
Like a pony that carries its master back home  
Like an old friend that's tried and been true  
My spirit will never be broken or caught  
For the soul is a free-flying thing  
Like an eagle that needs neither comfort nor thought  
To rise up on glorious wings  
  
I had a vision of eagles and horses  
High on a ridge in a race with the wind  
Going higher and higher and faster and faster  
On eagles and horses I'm flying again,  
I'm flying again, I'm flying again

My way was the hard way  
Didn't know it at the time  
I could've made it by now  
But I 'as too busy trying  
Your way was too easy  
Thank God you came along  
You took me to a special place  
Where nothing can go wrong  
  
Easy, on easy street  
You're the one who gave me love  
That made my love complete  
Easy, on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything I'll ever need  
Is here with you on easy street  
  
I know you're up to something  
What's on your little heart  
It really doesn't matter, 'cause  
I know I'll love my part  
  
Easy, on easy street  
You're the one who gave me love  
That made my love complete  
Easy, on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything I'll ever need  
Is here with you on easy street  
  
Is here with you on easy street  
The dream I pictured in my mind  
Could never be this sweet  
Everything I'll ever need  
Is here with you on easy street

The sun is slowly fadin' in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again  
  
There's a heavy smog between me and my mountains  
It's enough to make a grown man sit and cry  
It's enough to make you wonder  
It's enough to make the world roll up and die  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way that people work with their machines  
Serenity's a long time comin' to me  
The fact I don't believe that I know what it means  
  
In the east a shaded moon is hangin' lazily  
I do believe I saw the old man smile  
I do believe I did  
I do believe he's been laughin' all the while  
  
I think it's kind of interesting the way things get to be  
The way that people work with their machines  
Serenity's a long time comin' to me  
The fact I don't believe that I know what it means any more  
  
When the sun is slowly fadin' in the western sky  
Sometimes it takes forever the day to end  
Sometimes it takes a lifetime  
Sometimes I think I'll never see the sun again  
  
The sun again  
Sun again

Every day, it's a-getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.  
Love like yours will surely come my way.  
Every day, it's a-getting faster, everyone says go ahead and ask her.  
love like yours will surely come my way.  
  
Every day seems a little longer, in every way my love's a little stronger.  
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?  
  
Every day, it's a-getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.  
Love like yours will surely come my way.  
Every day, it's a-getting faster, everyone says go ahead and ask her.  
love like yours will surely come my way.  
  
Every day seems a little longer, in every way my love's a little stronger.  
Come what may, do you ever long for true love from me?  
  
Every day, it's a-getting closer, going faster than a roller coaster.  
Love like yours will surely come my way.  
Love like ours will surely be here to stay.

Are  
  
Thank you for this precious day  
These gifts you give to me  
My heart so full of love for you  
Sings praise for all I see  
Oh sing for every mother's child  
For every childhood tear  
Oh sing for all the stars above  
The peace beyond all fear  
  
This is for the refugees  
The ones without a home  
A boat out on the ocean  
A city street alone  
Are they not some dear mother's child  
Are they not you and I  
Are we the ones to bear this shame  
And they this sacrifice  
  
Or are they just like falling leaves  
Who give themselves away  
From dust to dust from seed to shear  
And to another day  
If I could have one wish on earth  
Of all I can conceive  
T'would be to see another spring  
And bless the falling leaves  
  
Thank you for this precious day  
These gifts you give to me  
My heart so full of love for you  
Sings praise for all I see  
Oh sing for every mother's child  
For every childhood tear  
Oh sing for all the stars above  
The peace beyond all fear  
  
Words and music by john denver

This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
First of all there's no one to talk to  
When there is they just don't seem to hear  
Words don't seem to matter much anyway  
They can't describe the pain  
They can't explain the fear  
  
Then the nights grow cold and hard to live through  
Still you hate to see the morning come  
Somehow tomorrow doesn't matter much anymore  
The future holds no promise  
Your life's already done  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
The you find your heart no longer flutters  
You no longer look through a lover's eyes  
What's to see when the world falls down around you  
You simply can't believe it  
But it comes as no surprise  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
  
What's the sense of failure  
It's such an incredible loss  
It's all the things you'll never do  
And all the dreams that will never come true  
  
This is what it's like falling out of love  
This is the way you lose your very best friend  
This is how it feels when it's all over  
This is just the way true love ends  
Oh this is just the way a true love ends  
I don't believe a true love ever ends

Welcome to my morning  
Welcome to my day  
I'm the one responsible  
I made it just this way  
To make myself some pictures  
See what they might bring  
I think I made it perfectly  
I wouldn't change a thing  
  
Welcome to my happiness  
You know it makes me smile  
And it pleases me to have you here  
For just a little while  
While we open up the spaces  
Try to break some chains  
And if the truth is told  
They will never come again  
  
Welcome to my evening  
The closing of the day  
I could try a million times  
Never find a better way  
To tell you that I love you  
And all the songs I play  
Are to thank you for allowing me  
Inside this lovely day  
  
Welcome to my morning  
Welcome to my day  
Yes, I'm the one responsible  
I made it just this way  
To make myself some pictures  
And see what they might bring  
I think I made it perfectly  
I wouldn't change a thing

This song was first released on the it's about time album. it is the only
album it has been released on.  
  
  
Oh, i have slipped the surly bonds of earth  
And danced the sky on laughter silvered wings  
Sunward i've climbed and joined the tumbling mirth  
Of sun-split clouds and done a hundred things  
I've wheeled and soared and swung high in the sunlit silence  
Hovering there i've chased the shouting winds aloft  
And flung my eager craft through footless halls of air  
  
The higher we fly, the farther we go  
The closer we are to each other  
The darker the night, the brighter the star  
In peace go my sisters and brothers  
  
Up, up, the long delirious burning blue  
I've topped the wind-swept heights with easy grace  
Where never lark nor even eagle flew  
And while with silent lifting mind i trod  
The high untresspassed sanctity of space  
Put out my hand and touched the face of god  
  
The higher we fly, the farther we go  
The closer we are to each other  
The darker the night, the brighter the star  
In peace go my sisters and brothers

Music by lee holdridge  
Adopted from the poem by john gillespie magee jr.  

All of her days have gone soft and cloudy  
All of her dreams have gone dry  
All of her nights have gone sad and shady  
She's getting ready to fly  
  
Fly away fly away fly away.  
  
Life in the city can make you crazy  
For sounds of the sand and the sea  
Life in a high-rise can make you hungry  
For things that you can't even see  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.  
  
In this whole world there's nobody as lonely as she  
There's nowhere to go and there's nowhere  
That she'd rather be.  
  
She's looking for lovers and children playing  
She's looking for signs of the spring  
She listens for laughter and sounds of dancing  
She listens for any old things  
  
Fly away, fly away, fly away.

It's by far the hardest thing I've ever done  
To be so in love with you and so alone  
  
[Chorus]  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
  
It's long been on my mind  
You know it's been a long, long time  
I've tried to find the way that I can make you understand  
The way I feel about you and just how much I need you  
To be there where I can talk to you  
When there's no one else around  
  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way and all around  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me  
  
You see I'd like to share my life with you  
And show you things I've seen  
Places that I'm going to places where I've been  
To have you there beside me and never be alone  
And all the time that you're with me  
We will be at home  
  
Follow me where I go what I do and who I know  
Make it part of you to be a part of me  
Follow me up and down all the way  
Take my hand and say you'll follow me

Ill walk in the rain by your side  
Ill cling to the warmth of your hand  
Ill do anything to keep you satisfied  
Ill love you more than anybody can  
  
And the wind will whisper your name to me  
Little birds will sing along in time  
Leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime  
  
Ill be there when you're feelin down  
To kiss away the fears if you cry  
Ill share with you all the happiness I've found  
A reflection of the love in your eyes  
  
And Ill sing you the songs of the rainbow  
A whisper of the joy that is mine  
And leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime  
  
Ill walk in the rain by your side  
Ill cling to the warmth of your tiny hand  
Ill do anything to help you understand  
And Ill love you more than anybody can  
  
And the wind will whisper your name to me  
Little birds will sing along in time  
Leaves will bow down when you walk by  
And morning bells will chime

Just a look in your eyes again  
Just to lay in your arms  
Just to be the first one always there for you  
Just to live in your laughter  
Just to sing in your heart  
Just to be everyone of your dreams come true  
  
Just to sit by your window  
Just to touch in the night  
Just to offer a prayer each day for you  
Just to long for your kisses  
Just to dream of your sighs  
Just to know that I'd give my life for you  
  
For you for the rest of my life  
For you all the best of my life  
For you alone, only for you  
  
Just to wake up each morning  
Just to you by my side  
Just to know that you're never really far away  
Just a reason for living  
Just to say I adore  
Just to know that you're here in my heart to stay  
  
For you for the rest of my life  
For you all the best of my life  
For you alone, only for you  
  
Just the words of a love song  
Just the beat of my heart  
Just the pledge of my life, my love, for you

Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
  
Guess I'll go out to Alberta, weather's good there in the fall  
Got some friends that I can go to working for  
Still I wish you'd change your mind, if I asked you one more time  
But we've been through that a hundred times or more  
  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
  
If I get there before the snowflies, and if things are going good  
You could meet me if I sent you down the fare  
But by then it would be winter, nothing much for you to do  
And the wind sure blows cold way out there  
  
Four strong winds that blow lonely, seven seas that run high  
All those things that don't change come what may  
Now our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.  
Yes our good times are all gone, and I'm bound for moving on  
But I'll look for you if I'm ever back this way.

Oh, spring is here and love is in the air  
Overflowing with life and I don't have a care  
I'm gonna see you shining like your diamond ring  
Every cell in our body is singing  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh, oh, gimme your love gimme your love  
  
All around I see signs of rebirth  
Resurrection, renewal, celebration of life on earth  
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow  
I love you, I want you, please say you'll  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh, oh, gimme your love gimme your love  
  
People think I'm crazy as I walk along the street  
I don't understand 'em anyway  
All I know is since you came my life has been so sweet  
And that's the way I know it's gonna stay  
  
Baby won't you stay with me and watch your garden grow  
I love you, I want you, please stay you'll  
  
Gimme your love forever  
Gimme your love  
Gimme your love forever  
Oh, oh, gimme your love gimme your love

It's five o'clock this morning, and the sun is on the rise  
There's frosting on the window pane, and sorrow in your eyes  
The stars are fading quietly, the night is nearly gone  
And so you turn away from me, and tears begin to come  
  
And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
It seems a shame to leave you now, the days are soft and warm  
I long to lay me down again, to hold you in my arms  
I long to kiss the tears away, give you back the smile  
Other voices beckon me, to go a little while  
  
And it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave  
  
Have to go and see some friends of mine, some that I don't know  
Some who aren't familiar with my name,  
It's something that's inside of me not hard to understand  
It's anyone who listens to me sing  
  
And if your hours are empty now, who am I to blame  
You think if I were always here, our love would be the same  
As it is the time we have, is worth the time alone  
And lying by your side, the greatest peace I've ever known  
  
But it's goodbye again, I'm sorry to be leavin' you  
Goodbye again, as if you didn't know  
It's goodbye again, and I wish you could tell me  
Why do we always fight when I have to leave

The prodigal son, he'd been away awhile  
He was workin' his way back home now  
Over many a ragged mile  
When he finally crossed the river  
And his father saw him near  
There was a joyful sound for all the world to hear  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
People tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Jesus, He did not doubt His gift  
Though He knew that He had not long to live  
He took care of the business  
Teaching us how to fly  
Then He bowed His head  
And laid down to die  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
And people tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Jerusalem, I see is standin' high  
But if you lose your salvation  
There'll be no tears left to cry  
Now some men worship a golden calf  
While others are bought and sold  
And if we live like that, brother, we pay the toll  
I listened to what the Good Book said  
And it made good sense to me  
Talkin' 'bout reapin' what you're sowin'  
And people tryin' to be free  
Now we got new names and faces  
This time around  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  
Still goin' down  
Still goin' down  
Gospel changes, Lord  
Still goin' down  

Ever since the day I met you  
I feel like I'm walking on air  
And lately I'm convinced it's no coincidence  
I run into into you everywhere  
  
And though I've heard your love is taken  
I gotta believe what's in your eyes  
Would I be out of line if I suggested a time  
And we got together one of these nights?  
  
[Chorus]  
Got my heart set on you  
You're everything I've ever wanted  
Got my heart set on you  
Can't be anything but love  
Baby, I'm bettin' on it  
  
I don't want to give you the wrong impression  
I'm not the kind who rushes in  
But, baby, every time I see you, before I even leave you  
I can hardly wait to see you again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't mean to be coming on strong  
Or taking everything for granted  
But love is a thing that just comes along  
You don't understand how it got out of hand  
But you're in it right from the start  
  
[Chorus]

When I was a little bitty boy just up off the floor  
We used to go down to grandma's house every month end or so  
We'd have chicken pie, country ham  
Homemade butter on the bread  
But the best darn thing about grandma's house  
Was the great big feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed  
  
After supper we'd sit around the fire, the old folks'd spit and chew  
Pa would talk about the farm and the war  
And granny'd sing a ballad or two  
And I'd sit and listen and watch the fire till the cobwebs filled my head  
Next thing I'd know I'd wake up in the morning  
In the middle of the old feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed  
  
Well, I love my ma and I love my pa, I love granny and grandpa too  
I've been fishin' with my uncles, I wrestled my cousin  
I even kissed Aunt Lou, ew!  
But if I ever had to make a choice I guess it oughta be said  
That I'd trade them all plus the gal down the road  
For grandma's feather bed  
  
It was nine feet high and six feet wide  
And soft as a downy chick  
It was made from the feathers of forty 'leven geese  
Took a whole bolt of cloth for the tick  
  
It could hold eight kids and four hound dogs  
And a piggy we stole from the shed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed  
We didn't get much sleep but we had a lot of fun  
On grandma's feather bed

Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little Christmas  
Make the Yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little Christmas now

Let the mountains talk  
Let the rivers run  
There is wisdom here  
There is much to learn  
There is much to know  
Much to understand  
In this healing time  
All across the land  
  
You have heard my songs  
Oh so many years  
You have laughed with me  
Washed away my tears  
You have shared my joy  
You have felt my pain  
In this healing time  
Walk with me again  
  
Through these darker days  
On this narrow line  
Help me find my way  
Help me see the signs  
I am not afraid  
I am not alone  
You have taught me well  
You have brought me home  
  
Let the mountains speak  
Let the rivers run  
As the world awakes  
To the rising sun  
In each brand new day  
In our own rebirth  
In this healing time  
On our mother earth  
  
Let the mountains talk  
And let the rivers run  
There is wisdom here  
There's so much to learn  
In each brand new day  
In our own rebirth  
In this healing time  
For our mother earth  
  
In each brand new day  
In our own rebirth  
In this healing time  
Here on mother earth

There are children raised in sorrow  
On a scorched and barren plain  
There are children raised beneath a golden sun  
There are children of the water  
Children of the sand  
And they cry out through the universe  
Their voices raised as one  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live  
  
Have you gazed out on the ocean  
Seen the breaching of a whale?  
Have you watched the dolphins frolic in the foam?  
Have you heard the song the humpback hears five hundred miles away  
Telling tales of ancient history of passages and home?  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live  
  
For the worker and the warrior the lover and the liar  
For the native and the wanderer in kind  
For the maker and the user and the mother and her son  
I am looking for my family and all of you are mine  
  
We are standing all together  
Face to face and arm in arm  
We are standing on the threshold of s dream  
No more hunger no more killing  
No more wasting life away  
It is simply an idea  
And I know its time has come  
  
I want to live I want to grow  
I want to see I want to know  
I want to share what I can give  
I want to be I want to live

This song was first released on the whose garden was this? Album. It is the
only album it has been released on.  
  
I wish I could have been there on the highway  
When the people came from miles around to see  
The children of the flowers come together  
  
I wish I could have been there in the sunshine  
With the sound of lovely laughter in the air  
And the music makers first began to play  
To hear them play  
  
And I wish I could have been there in the rain  
When the clouds were full of castles in the sky  
And I wish I could have heard the people sing  
As the rhytmn and the words came floating by  
  
I wish I could have been there in the starlight  
When the country side was trying once again  
And the music and the makers the poets and the singers  
And the children of the flowers have all gone  
  
Words and music by john denver

And I wish I knew how  
It would feel to be free  
I wish that I could break  
All the chains holding me  
I wish I could say  
All the things that I'd like to say  
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear  
For the whole round world to hear  
I wish I could share  
All the love that's in my heart  
Remove every doubt  
That keeps us apart  
And I wish you could know  
What it means to be me  
Then you'd see and agree  
Every man should be free  
I wish I could live  
Like I'm longin' to live  
And I wish that I could give  
What I'm longin' to give  
And I wish I could do  
All the things I'd like to do  
You know they're still here's quite a few  
Yes sir, and I'm way, way over due  
I wish I could be  
Like a bird up in the sky  
How sweet it would be  
If I found out I could fly  
So long to the sun  
And look down upon the sea  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels to be  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels  
And I sing because I know  
How it feels to be free, yeah  

(Lady's Chains)  
Jessie went away last summer, a couple of months ago.  
After all our time together, it was hard to see her go.  
She called me right up when she arrived, asked me one more time to come,  
but living on an LA freeway ain't my kind of having fun.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
  
When we were just beginning, it was such an easy way.  
Laying back up in the mountains making love for sunny days.  
She got tired of picking daisies and cooking my meals for me,  
she can live the life she wants to, yes, it's all right with me.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
  
I'd rather live on the side of a mountain than wander through canyons of
concrete and steel.  
I'd rather laugh in the rain and sunshine and lay down my sundown in some
starry field.  
  
Oh, but I miss her in the morning when I awake alone.  
The absence of her laughter is a cold and empty sound.  
But her memory always makes me smile and I want you to know,  
I love her, yes I love her just enough to let her go.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy, I think I'd rather ride the range.  
I think I'd rather be a cowboy than to lay me down in love and lady's chains.

I'd sing you a song, without a word  
Still you would hear my tune  
I'd give you a day, without a time  
So it won't end too soon  
  
Anything, I would do  
And that really is my point of view  
If ever, my darling in my life  
I ever had a chance to love you  
  
I'd build you a world made of the dream  
That dances on your head  
Take a rainbow with colours bright  
To hang over your head  
  
Anything, I would do  
And that really is my point of view  
If ever, my darling in my life  
I ever had a chance to love you  
  
Fate's been waiting for the right time  
To put us in each other's arms  
But why should we sit and waste time  
To start right now would do no harm  
  
Give me a sign and I will show you  
The magic of when I speak  
Open your heart, let me come in  
My love is yours to keep  
  
Anything, I would do  
And that really is my point of view  
If ever, my darling in my life  
I ever had a chance to love you  
  
If I ever had a chance to love you  
If I ever had a chance to love you

I don't know why  
We still live together  
We're so far apart  
So much of the time  
I don't know why  
This beautiful weather  
Is breaking my spirit  
And tearing my mind all apart  
  
Are you so lonely  
Are you so sad  
Have you lost your purpose  
The faith that you had  
If life is a question  
I don't understand  
If time is the reason  
Then nobody can  
  
In my heart it is just an illusion  
It's not even real  
Much more than you think  
It's much more than you feel  
  
My ears are still ringing  
There's nothing to say  
Why look to the ocean  
To wash me away  
There goes my best friend  
There goes my last dime  
If love is the answer  
I'm wasting my time  
  
In my heart it is just an illusion  
It's not even real  
Much more than you think  
It's much more than you feel  
Do you feel  
Is this real  
How I feel  
In my heart

Islands call out to me  
Like the highlands that I always see  
In my dreams of home  
I am never alone when I am there  
  
Islands like so many dreams  
Are like canyons but off the main stream  
And there's no one there  
The dreamer is always alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And the mighty blue ocean  
Keeps rolling on every shore  
Like the spirit that binds us together  
We are so much more than islands  
  
Islands belong to the sea  
Like the dark sands of my memory  
When the morning comes  
They are stepping stones to the sun  
  
[Chorus]

This song was first released on the Back Home Again album. It is the only
album it has been released on.  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go it's up to you  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Following your heart, playing your own part  
You and me out on a farm, let the sun be our alarm  
Kickin' off your shoes, doin' what we choose  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Knowing that your mine anytime you want to be  
But I don't want to own you  
I just want to hold you  
I don't want to need you  
I just like to see you smile and stay for awhile  
And if the times get rough, being free might be enough  
To see us through the storm and keep our feelings warm  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Looking back and knowing that we helped each other find  
You can do whatever you want to do  
Wherever you want to go it's up to you  
And wouldn't it be fine  
Following your heart knowing from the start  
It's up to you  
It's up to you  
It's up to you

When Jenny was a little girl, she only dreamed of trains  
She never played with dolls or lacy kinds of things  
Jenny counted boxcars instead of counting sheep  
She could go anywhere when she went to sleep  
  
All she ever talked about was getting on to ride  
She was living in another time you could see it in her eyes  
And every day after school she'd head down to the track  
Waiting for the train that was never coming back  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
The depot's been boarded up, the rails have turned to rust  
There hasn't been a train through here since the mill went bust  
No one believed her when she said she heard the train  
Said she was just a little girl acting kind of strange  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
Jenny laid a penny on the track one day  
In God we trust she walked away  
The very next morning all she could find  
Was a little piece of copper squashed flatter than a dime  
  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
When the nighttime came  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains  
  
Nobody knew how she made it come true  
Jenny dreamed of trains

Get up Jimmy Newman, the morning is come.  
The engines are rumbling.  
The coffee's all brewed.  
Get up Jimmy Newman, there's work to be done.  
And why do you lie there still sleeping.  
There's a waiting line forming  
To use the latrine.  
And the sun is just opening the skies.  
The breakfast they're serving just has to be seen.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
Get up Jimmy Newman my radio's on.  
The news is all bad, but it's good for a laugh.  
The tent flap is loose and the peg must be gone.  
And why do you lie there still sleeping.  
The night nurse is gone  
And the sexy one's here.  
And she tells us such beautiful lies.  
Her uniform's tight.  
Oh her marvelous rear.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
Get up Jimmy Newman you're missing the fun.  
They're talking us next, Jim.  
It's time to go home.  
It's over for us there's no more to be done.  
And why do you lie there still sleeping.  
It's state side for us, Jim.  
The folks may not know.  
And we'll let it be such a surprise.  
They're loading us next, Jim we're ready to go.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
And you've only to open your eyes.  
Get up Jimmy open your eyes.  

Way down in Louisiana close to New Orleans  
Way back up in the woods among the evergreens  
There stood a log cabin mad of earth and wood  
Where lived a country boy name of Johnny B. Goode  
He never ever learned to read or write so well  
But he could play a guitar just like a-ringing a bell  
  
[Chorus]  
Go, go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go, go Johnny go  
Go Johnny B. Goode  
  
He used to carry his guitar in a gunny sack  
Go sit beneath the tree by the railroad track  
The engineers would see him sitting in the shade  
Strumming to the rhythm that the drivers made  
People passing by would they would stop and say  
Oh my but that little country boy can play  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well his mama told him some day you will be a man  
You will be the leader of a big old band  
Many people coming from miles around  
Just to hear you play your music till the sun go down  
Maybe some day your name will be in lights  
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight  
  
[Chorus]

Motorcars, handlebars, bicycles for two  
Brokenhearted jubilee  
Parachutes, army boots, sleeping bags for two  
Sentimental jamboree  
  
Buy, Buy says the sign in the shop window  
Why, why says the junk in the yard  
Ya da da da da La da da da  
  
Buy, Buy says the sign in the shop window  
Why, why says the junk in the yard  
Ya da da da da da da la la la la la  
  
Candlesticks, building bricks, something old and new  
Memories for you and me

Oh, at first it was just like heaven in your heart and in your arms  
And paradise discovered in the sweetness of your charms  
Yes, and every day a miracle to awake and be with you  
And every night in your embrace another dream come true  
Oh, but castles sometimes crumble, some rivers still run dry  
And fairy tales are witches tales when the truth becomes a lie  
And a pocket full of promises won't buy a diamond ring  
And every word you said to me just didn't mean a thing  
It's over now, you've gone too far I can't take anymore  
Be careful now, don't hurt yourself when you walk through the door  
I can hardly stand to look at you it makes me want to cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Oh, I suppose I'll never know why things turned out this way  
And why the one you love the most is the one you drove away?  
Yes, and I suppose I'll never, ever really understand  
How I could think that you'd make me a happy married man  
So now I sit and contemplate the reason for it all  
The climb to heights of ecstasy, the failure and the fall  
If a broken heart is purposeful it's in the lesson learned  
But no matter what the reason is it hurts when you get burned  
Now I don't care, I don't think I'll ever love again  
Kemosabe used to mean "a good and trusted friend"  
But now it stands for therapy and all the tears I cry  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  
Bye, bye goodbye  
Get your tongue out of my mouth because I'm kissing you goodbye  

He was born in International Falls a long, long time ago  
Moved to Tucumcan when the ironwork got show  
He was cornbread and hard scrabble and scratching for every dime  
Till he threw it in and he kilt the road to walk that endless line  
  
Now he's The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Leaving here  
  
Now he's The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Away from here  
  
He tried his hand at lots of jobs  
And he did 'em all with pride  
From shoeing mules to driving trucks,  
He mastered what he tried  
It must have been Ramona,  
She was all he cared about  
When she ran away and left him  
You could see the fire go out  
  
Now he's The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Away from here  
  
We hardly ever see him  
Once or twice and he would stay a day or two  
He'd ask about Ramona  
Then he'd say that he was only passing through  
Now he knows every railroad bull along the right of way  
And every hobo jungle from New York to Santa Fe  
He's looked for his Ramona on the far side of the hill  
Now his sun is sinking lower and he's looking for her still  
  
Now he's The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Leaving from here  
  
Now he's The Last Hobo  
Riding the last boxcar  
On the last freight train  
Away from here

That last train done left town  
That last train done left town  
I heard the whistle moaning low  
That last train done gone down  
  
My sweet baby's on that train  
My sweet baby's on that train  
I wonder if I will see her again  
That last train done gone down  
  
I heard that whistle moanin' low  
I heard that whistle moanin' low  
I'm begging and pleading, please don't go  
That last train done gone down  
  
I'm sorry for what I've done  
I'm sorry for what I've done  
Too late good-bye, my sweet baby cried  
That last train done left town  
  
That last train done left town  
That last train done left town  
I heard that whistle moanin' low  
That last train done gone down

There's lonely hearts in Arkansas  
There's truckers in Des Moines  
All there to keep me company in the early morn  
A world unknown to daytime  
Is forever going on  
The airways of the nation  
Between midnight and the dawn  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio  
  
Well I turn the dial  
A little bit past one-o-one point two  
In time to catch the news  
And see who's shooting who  
Then I hunt around for old songs  
They're so good to hear again  
To think of how it was  
Imagine how it might have been  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio  
  
La La La I sing along  
'Cause I never know the words  
La La La La La La La La La  
I'd love to call a talk show  
But I haven't got the nerve  
La La La Oh Oh Oh radio  
  
The Lord is still my shepherd  
But these preachers got to go  
This time of night my interest  
Lies in U.F.O.'s  
So I turn the dial a little  
Past fifty-six point three  
To find myself a lullaby  
To rock me off to sleep  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio  
  
Late night radio  
Take it everywhere I go  
Best friend when I'm lonely  
Is my late night radio

When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
  
And when the broken hearted people living in the world agree  
There will be an answer, let it be  
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer, let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah  
There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be  
  
And when the night is cloudy there is still a light that shines on me  
Shine until tomorrow, let it be  
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  
There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  
There will be an answer, let it be  
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be

I am the son of a grassland farmer  
Western Oklahoma 1943  
I always felt grateful to live in the land of the free  
I gave up my father to South Korea  
The mind of my brother to Vietnam  
Now there's a banker who says I must give up my land  
There are four generations of blood in this topsoil  
Four generations of love on this farm  
Before I give up I would gladly give up my right arm  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
I had a son and my son was a soldier  
He was so like my father, he was so much like me  
To be a good comrade was the best that he dreamed he could be  
He gave up his future to revolution  
His life to a battle that just can't be won  
For this is not living, to live at the point of a gun  
I remember the nine hundred days of Leningrad  
The sound of the dying, the cut of the cold  
I remember the moments I prayed I would never grow old  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
For the first time in my life I feel like a prisoner  
A slave to the ways of the powers that be  
And I fear for my children, as I fear for the for the future I see  
Tell me how can it be we're still fighting each other  
What does it take for a people to learn  
If our song is not sung as a chorus, we surely will burn  
What are we making weapons for  
Why keep on feeding the war machine  
We take it right out of the mouths of our babies  
Take it away from the hands of the poor  
Tell me, what are we making weapons for  
Have we forgotten all the lives that were given  
All the vows that were taken saying never again  
Now for the first time this could be the last time  
If peace is our vision let us begin  
Have we forgotten all the lives that were given  
All the vows that were taken saying never again, never again  
Now for the first time this could be the last time  
If peace is our vision, let us begin, let us begin  

Usually in the morning I'm filled with sweet belonging  
And ev'rything is beautiful to see  
Even when it's raining, the sound of heaven singing  
Is simply joyful music to me.  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like I'm all alone without you.  
  
So many diff'rent places, a million smiling faces  
Life is so incredible to me  
Especially to be near you and how it is to touch you  
Oh paradise was made for you and me.  
  
I know that life goes on just perfectly  
And ev'rything is just the way that it should be  
Still there are times when my heart feels like breaking  
And anywhere is where I'd rather be.  
  
Oh and in the night time I know that it's the right time  
To hold you close and say I love you so  
To have someone to share with  
And someone I can care with  
And that is why I wanted you to know  
  
Sometimes I feel like a sad song  
Like I'm all alone without you, without you.

Mo boys, is you right  
Done got it right  
All I hate about linin' track  
These ol' boys are gonna break my back  
  
[Chorus:]  
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)  
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)  
Mo boys, can't you line 'em (track a lack)  
See Eloise gonna line 'em track  
  
Down in the holler below the fleld  
Angels working on the chariot wheel  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mary and the babe was a sittin' in the shade  
Thinking on the money that I ain't made  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Moses stood on the Red Sea shore  
Gotta batten down the waves with a two by four  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now if I could I surely would  
Stand on the rock where Moses stood  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Matthew, Mark, Luke and John  
All them disciples dead and gone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Mo boys, is you right  
Done got it right  
All I hate about lining track  
These ol' boys about to break my back  
  
[Chorus]

Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year, oooo.  
Well, way up north where the air gets cold,  
there's a tale about Christmas that you've all been told.  
And a real famous cat all dressed up in red,  
and he spends the whole year working out on his sled,  
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.  
  
Just a little bobsled, calls it old Saint Nick,  
But he sparks the buggy with a full speed stick.  
He's candy apple red with a ski for a wheel,  
Then he gives gas and just watch him peel, yeah,  
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.  
  
Run run reindeer, run run reindeer, run run reindeer,  
run run reindeer, run run run, yeah!  
  
He's rolling through the snow at a frightful speed  
with a half dozen deer with Rudy to lead.  
He's gotta wear his goggle cause the snow really flies,  
and he's cruising every path with a little surprise,  
it's a little Saint Nick, it's a little Saint Nick.  
  
Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year,  
(run run run run reindeer!)  
Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year,  
(run run run run reindeer!)  
Oo, merry Christmas, Santa only comes this time each year,  
(run run run run reindeer!) all right, that's nice. Sorry.

On the road of experience, I'm trying to find my own way.  
Sometimes I wish that I could fly away  
When I think that I'm moving, suddenly things stand still  
I'm afraid 'cause I think they always will  
  
And I'm looking for space  
And to find out who I am  
And I'm looking to know and understand  
It's a sweet, sweet dream  
Sometimes I'm almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
And sometimes I'm deep in despair  
  
All alone in the universe, sometimes that's how it seems  
I get lost in the sadness and the screams  
Then I look in the center, suddenly everything's clear  
I find myself in the sunshine and my dreams  
  
And I'm looking for space  
And to find out who I am  
And I'm looking to know and understand  
It's a sweet, sweet dream  
Sometimes I'm almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
And sometimes I'm deep in despair  
  
On the road of experience, join in the living day  
If there's an answer, it's just that it's just that way  
  
When you're looking for space  
And to find out who you are  
When you're looking to try and reach the stars  
It's a sweet, sweet, sweet dream  
Sometimes I'm almost there  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle  
But sometimes I'm deep in despair  
Sometimes I fly like an eagle,  
Like an eagle  
I go flying flying

I didn't think it could happen again  
I'm just too old and set in my ways  
I was convinced I would always be lonely  
All of the rest of my days  
Maybe I give up on romance  
In my longing to give up the pain  
I just didn't believe I would ever love again  
  
I was like one who had shut myself in  
Closed the windows, locked all the doors  
Afraid of the dark and the beat of my heart  
Yet knowing there had to be more  
Though it sounds like a great contradiction  
It's the easiest thing to explain  
You see, I was afraid I might never love again  
  
What does it take for a blind man to see  
That there's more there than just meets the eye  
What are the ways that the magic comes in  
That can turn a song into a sigh  
Sometimes I think that I'm dreaming  
Or maybe I'm going insane  
Or maybe it's just that I'm falling in love again  
  
Here I am standing beside you  
Oh life's such a wonderful game  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love  
Look at me now, I'm falling in love again

Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Open yourself to the first celebration  
Open your eyes to the joy and pain  
Life is the fruit of your own creation  
Every new birth is a soul regained  
  
Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Drinking my life from a silver fountain  
Sweet water running to the cold salt sea  
Old man moon on a white-top mountain  
Sound of the wind singing dreams for me  
  
Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me  
  
Follow your heart like a flying stallion  
Race with the sun to the edge of night  
Form your truth like a gold medallion  
Dance in the circle of the love and the light  
  
Love is everywhere, I see it  
You are all that you can be, go on and be it  
Life is perfect, I believe it  
Come and play the game with me

Living on free food tickets  
Watering the milk from the hole in the roof  
Where the rain came through  
What can we do?  
Tears from your baby sister crying  
'Cause she doesn't have a dress  
Without a patch for the party to go  
Ah, but you know she'll get by  
Because she's living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mommy's gonna love you just as much as she can  
And she can  
It's a good thing you don't have bus fare  
It would fall through the hole in your pocket  
And you'd lose it in the snow on the ground  
Walkin' to town to find a job  
Tryin' to keep your hands warm  
But the hole in your shoe lets the snow come through  
And it chills to the bone  
Boy, you better go home where it's warm  
And you can live in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mummy's goin' to love you just as much as she can  
And she can  
Livin' on dreams ain't easy  
But the closer the knit, the tighter the fit  
And the chills stay away  
You take them in stride, family pride  
You know faith is your foundation  
With a whole lot of love and a warm conversation  
And many a prayer  
Making you strong, where you belong  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mummy's goin' to love you just as much as she can  
Yeah  
Living in the love of the common people  
Smiles from the heart of a family man  
Daddy's goin' to buy you a dream to cling to  
Mummy's goin' to love you just as much as she can  
Yeah  

Had an uncle named Matthew  
He was his father's only boy  
Born just South of Cobly, Kansas  
He was his mother's pride and joy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yes, and joy was just the thing that he was raised on  
Love is just the way to live and die  
Gold is just a windy Kansas wheat-field  
And blue is just a Kansas summer sky  
  
And all the stories that he told me  
Back when I was just a lad  
All the memories that he gave me  
All the good times that he had  
  
Growin' up a Kansas farmboy  
Life was mostly havin' fun  
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders  
Behind a view beneath the sun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I guess there were some hard times  
And I'm told some years were lean  
They had a storm in forty-seven  
A twister came and stripped them clean  
  
He lost the farm and lost his family  
He lost the wheat and lost his home  
But he found a family Bible  
Faith as solid as a stone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So he came to live at our house  
And he came to work the land  
He came to ease my Daddy's burden  
And he came to be my friend  
  
So, I wrote this down for Matthew  
And it's for him the song is sung  
Ridin' on his Daddy's shoulders  
Behind a mule beneath the sun  
  
[Chorus x 2]

When I was a young man  
I ran away from home  
I went to join the circus  
Went to see the cotton candy whirl  
And make me lots of money on my own  
For Molly, oh, my pretty Molly  
But she's waiting all alone  
Someday soon I will return to her  
  
Then I made the big time  
Bright 11ghts, show biz  
I'm really in the circus  
There's only one thing wrong  
  
I haven't saved a penny on my own  
For Molly, oh, my pretty Molly  
But she's writing everyday  
Molly understands, so it's okay  
  
Ride a windy box car  
See a thousand children young and old  
Oh, that grease paint smile  
Can hide your soul  
Here comes a carousel  
Guess which town it is  
Feel the thrill  
Grease paint covers everything  
But winters chill  
  
I'm reading Molly's letter  
The ink is fading  
And the page is fuming yellow  
Long ago, I promised Molly  
Don't you know I  
I will close my eyes and go to her?

This song was first released on the Live at the Sydney Opera House album.  
It is the only album it has been released on.  
  
One Sunday morning as I was walking  
By Brisbane Waters I chance to stray  
I heard a convict his fait bewhaling  
As on the sunny riverbank he lay  
  
I am a native of Erin, Ireland  
But banished now from my native shore  
They stole me from my independence  
And from the maiden whom I do adore  
  
I've been a prisoner at Port Macquarie  
At Norfolk Island and Emu Plains  
At Castle Ule and Curstune Garbby  
At all these settlements I've been enchained  
  
But of all places of condemnation  
And penal stations in New South Wales  
To Moreton Bay I have found no equal  
Excessive tyranny each day prevails  
  
For three long years I was beastly treated  
And heavy irons on my legs I wore  
My back from flogging was lacerated  
And oft times covered with my crimson gore  
  
And many a man from downright starvation  
Lies smouldering now beneath the cave  
And Captain Logan he had us mangled  
On the triangles of Moreton Bay  
  
Like the Egyptians and ancient Hebrews  
We were oppressed under Logan's yoh  
Till a native black lying bare and ambush  
Did deal out tyrant with his mortal stroke  
  
My fellow prisoners be exhilerated  
Let all such monsters like death shall find  
And when from bondage we're extricated  
Our former suffering shall will fade from mind  
  
One Sunday morning as I was walking  
By Brisbane Waters I chance to stray  
I heard a convict his fait bewhaling  
As on the sunny riverbank he lay

Knew a man Bojangles and he danced for you  
In worn out shoes.  
Silver hair, ragged shirt and baggy pants.  
The old soft shoe.  
He jumped so high, he jumps so high.  
Then he'd lightly touch down.  
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles dance.  
  
Met him in a cell, in New Orleans it was.  
Down and out.  
He looked to me to be the eyes of age as he,  
he spoke right out.  
He talked about life, he talked of life.  
He laughed, slapped his leg instead.  
  
He said the name Bojangles and he danced a lick  
Across the cell.  
He grabbed his pants and took a stance and he jumped so high.  
He clicked his heels.  
He let go a laugh, he let go a laugh.  
Shook his clothes all around.  
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles dance.  
  
He danced for those at minstrel shows and county fairs  
Throughout the South.  
And he spoken in tears of 15 years how it's dogging him.  
They traveled about.  
The dog up and died he up and died  
after 20 years he still grieves.  
  
He said I dance now at every chance and honky tonks  
For drinks and tips.  
But most the time I spend behind these county bars.  
'Cause I drink a bit.  
And he shook his head now, he shook his head.  
And I heard someone ask please  
Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles, Mr. Bojangles dance.

This song was first released on the rhymes and reasons album. it is the only
album it has been released on.  
I told you that I loved you  
You said that is so good  
I called you my darlin'  
I thought I always would  
But now you've gone and left me  
I don't know what to do  
So my little darlin'  
I write these words to you  
You dun stomped on my heart  
And you mashed that sucker flat  
You just sortta stomped on high aorta  
You started going out with guys  
I felt us drum apart  
And every step you took  
Was a stomp upon my heart  
I onty hope that someday you get  
Them low down blues  
In some smokey honky tonk  
You looked down at your shoes  
You'll think about that tender heart  
That you crushed beneath them soles  
With your cold bustin' stompers  
You left my head so full of holes

My old man had a rounder's soul.  
He'd hear an old freight train.  
Then he'd have to go.  
Said he'd been blessed with a gipsy bone.  
  
That's the reason they guessed  
He'd been cursed to roam.  
Came into town back before the war.  
  
Didn't even know what it was  
He was looking for.  
He carried a tattered bag for his violin.  
  
It was full of lots of songs  
Of places that he'd been.  
He talked real ea-sy had a smiling way  
  
To pass along to you  
When his fiddle played.  
Making people drop their cares and woes.  
  
To hum out loud those tunes  
That his fiddle howed.  
Till the people there began to join that sound.  
  
And everyone in town was laughing.  
Singing, dancing round.  
Like the fiddler's tune was all they heard that night.  
  
As if some dream said  
"All the world is right"  
His fiddler's eye caught one beauty there.  
  
She had that rollin' flowin'  
golden kind of hair.  
He played for her as if she danced alone.  
  
He played his favorite songs.  
Ones he called his own.  
He played until she was the last to go.  
  
He stopped and packed his case  
And said he'd take her home.  
  
All the nights that passed a child was born.  
All the years that passed.  
That love would keep them warm.  
All their lives they'd share a dream come true.  
  
All because she danced  
while his fiddle tuned.  
My old man had a rounder's soul.  
  
He'd hear an old freight train.  
Then he'd have to go.  
All that I recall said when I was so young.  
  
No one else could really  
Sing those songs he sung.

Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me  
Did you think our time together was all gone  
Lady, you've been dreaming, I'm as close as I can be  
And I swear to you our time has just begun  
  
Close your eyes and rest your weary mind  
I promise I will stay right here beside you  
Today our lives were joined, became entwined  
I wish that you could know how much I love you  
  
Lady, are you happy, do you feel the way I do  
Are there meanings that you've never seen before  
Lady, my sweet lady, I just can't believe it's true  
And it's like I've never, ever loved before  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Lady, are you crying, do the tears belong to me  
Did you think our time together was all gone  
Lady, my sweet lady, I'm as close as I can be  
And I swear to you our time has just begun

They are minstrels and beggars  
Always in the sight of the king  
Sometimes they sleep in the daytime  
Come out in the night time and sing  
They come into the castle  
Through whatever window they can find  
They come into your mind  
Dreams of flying  
Dreams of being free  
Nobody can take my dreams from me.  
Nobody can take my dreams from me.  
  
You can bind me in chains  
Lock me up in a jailhouse to rot  
And if you come to see me  
You might think I'm there, but I am not  
They can sail into prison  
Find a way through any basement door  
They can offer you more  
Dreams of flying  
Dreams of being free  
Nobody can take my dreams from me  
Nobody can take my dreams from me  
You can take my money  
Take my reputation  
Even take my colour TV  
Nobody can take my dreams from me  
Nobody can take my dreams from me

A frosty Christmas Eve, when the stars where shining,  
I traveled for the home, where westward falls the hill.  
And for many, many a village, in the darkness of the valley,  
distant music reached me, peels of bells were ringing.  
  
Then spread my thoughts to olden times, to that first of Christmases  
when shepherds who were watching, heard music in the fields.  
And they sat there and they marveled, and they knew they could not tell  
whether it were angels, or the bright stars a singing.  
  
But to me heard a far, it was starry music,  
the singing of the angels, the comfort of our Lord.  
Words of old that come a traveling, by the riches of the times,  
and I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.  
And I softly listened, as I stood upon the hill.

Life is just too short for some folks  
For other folks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure tea's too strong  
  
Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride the middle  
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north  
  
In a small suburban garden  
Not a single neighbour knows our name  
I know the woman wishes we would move some place  
Where the houses aren't all the same  
  
Jesse, I wish you would take mewhere the grass is greener  
I couldn't really say where it may be  
Oh, some place high on a montain top  
Bown by the deep blue sea  
  
And there we'll do just as we please  
It ain't nothing but a breeze  
  
One day I'll be old gray Grandpa  
All the pretty girls will call me "Sir"  
Now where they're asking me how things are  
Soon they'll ask me how things are  
  
Well, I don't mind being an old gray Grandpa  
As long as you'll be my gray Grandma  
But I wish we would move with our tea and cookies  
To the shade of the old pawpaw  
  
There we'll do just as we please  
It ain't nothing but a breeze  
  
Life is just too short for some folks  
For other foks it just drags on  
Some folks like the taste of smokey whiskey  
Others figure tea's too strong  
  
Well, I'm the type of guy who wants to ride in the middle  
I don't like all this bouncing back and forth  
Me, I want to live with my feet in Dixie  
And my head in the cool blue north  
  
Words and Music by Jesse Winchester

Rocky mountain Christmas and Christmas like a lullaby  
Oh holy night  
The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of the dear savior's birth  
Long lay the world in sin and error pining  
'Til he appeared and the soul felt  
Its worth  
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and  
Glorious morn.  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the  
Angel voices.  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night  
Oh holy night  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the  
Angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night  
Oh holy night

The old folks don't talk much  
They talk so slowly when they do  
They are rich they are poor  
Their illusions are gone  
They share one heart for two  
  
Their homes all smell of time  
Of old photographs  
And an old fashioned song  
Though you may live in town  
You live so far away  
When you've lived too long  
  
Have they laughed too much  
Do their dry voices crack  
Talking of things gone by  
Have they cried too much  
A tear or two still always seems  
To cloud the eye  
  
They tremble as they watch the old silver clock  
When day is through  
Tick tock oh so slow  
It says yes it says no  
It says I wait for you  
  
The old folks dream no more  
Their books have gone to sleep  
The piano's out of tune  
The little cat is dead  
And no more do they sing on a Sunday afternoon  
  
The old folks move no more  
Their world become to small  
Their bodies feel like lead  
They might look out a window  
Or else sit it a chair  
Or else they stay in bed  
  
And if they still go out  
Arm in arm, arm in arm  
In the morning chill  
Its to have a good cry  
To say their last goodbye  
To one who's older still  
And then they go home  
To the old silver clock  
When day is through  
Tick tock so so slow  
It says yes it says no  
It says I wait for you  
  
The old folks never die  
They just put down their heads  
And go to sleep one day  
They will hold each others hands  
Like children in the dark  
But one will get lost anyway  
And the other will remain  
Just sitting in a room  
Which makes no sound  
It doesn't matter now  
The song has died away  
And echo's all around  
  
You'll see them as they walk  
Through the s

When I was a child, my family would travel  
Down to western Kentucky where my parents were born  
And there's a backwards old town that's often remembered  
So many times that my memories are worn  
  
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County  
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay  
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking  
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away  
  
Well sometimes we'd travel right down the Green River  
To the abandoned old prison down by Adrie Hill  
Where the air smelled like snakes and we'd shoot with our pistols  
But empty pop bottles was all we would kill  
  
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County  
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay  
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking  
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away  
  
And the coal company came with the world's largest shovel  
And they tortured the timber and stripped all the land  
Well, they dug for their coal till the land was forsaken  
Then they wrote it all down as the progress of man  
  
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County  
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay  
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking  
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away  
  
And daddy won't you take me back to Muhlenberg County  
Down by the Green River where Paradise lay  
Well, I'm sorry, my son, but you're too late in asking  
Mister Peabody's coal train has hauled it away

Peaceful valleys, animals and children asking me  
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin  
  
A kid knows what he wants to be before he's nine or ten  
Cowboys, clowns, and men of war and someone else's friend  
But nine grows into big boys' pants and then to scars and pain  
Twenty's fast and hard as nails but doesn't come again  
  
There's days to fall and days to rise and days for making haste  
Days for seeking out yourself but no days you can waste  
Nighttimes filled with love so good it aches to rest it down  
Endless hallways dark with sleep and rivers dark with sound  
  
Peaceful valleys, animals and children asking me  
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin  
  
Children climbing on my arms and pigeons on my head  
Get thee up my little man and dream a dream instead  
dream a dream of rocking chairs and flying through the night  
Dream until the morning's gone and turned the dark to light  
  
Then come and get your daddy if he hasn't blown away  
Rock him in your children's hands and help him find his way  
Take him to your hiding place and let him come inside  
He'll never tell your secret, cross my heart and hope to die  
  
Peaceful valleys, animals and children asking me  
Tell the story that you told of sailors drinking tea  
Tell the one about the man who saddled up the wind  
Pegasus and flying fish and woodsmen made of tin

Perhaps love is like a resting place  
A shelter from the storm  
It exists to give you comfort  
It is there to keep you warm  
And in those times of trouble  
When you are most alone  
The memory of love will bring you home  
  
Perhaps love is like a window  
Perhaps an open door  
It invites you to come closer  
It wants to show you more  
And even if you lose yourself  
And don't know what to do  
The memory of love will see you through  
  
Oh, love to some is like a cloud  
To some as strong as steel  
For some a way of living  
For some a way to feel  
And some say love is holding on  
And some say letting go  
And some say love is everything  
And some say they don't know  
  
Perhaps love is like the ocean  
Full of conflict, full of pain  
Like a fire when it's cold outside  
Or thunder when it rains  
If I should live forever  
And all my dreams come true  
My memories of love will be of you

I've been lately thinking  
About my life's time  
All the things I've done  
And how it's been  
And I can't help believing  
In my own mind  
I know I'm gonna hate to see it end  
  
I've seen a lot of sunshine  
Slept out in the rain  
Spent a night or two all on my own  
I've known my lady's pleasures  
Had myself some friends  
And spent a time or two all on my own  
  
And I have to say it now  
It's been a good life all in all  
It's really fine  
To have a chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire  
And watch the evening tire  
While all my friends and my old lady  
Sit and pass the pipe around  
  
And talk of poems and prayers and promises  
And things that we believe in  
How sweet it is to love someone  
How right it is to care  
How long it's been since yesterday  
And what about tomorrow  
And what about our dreams  
And all the memories we share  
  
The days they pass so quickly now  
Nights are seldom long  
And time around me whispers when it's cold  
The changes somehow frighten me  
Still I have to smile  
It turns me on to think of growing old  
For though my life's been good to me  
There's still so much to do  
So many things my mind has never known  
I'd like to raise a family  
I'd like to sail away  
And dance across the mountains on the moon  
  
I have to say it now  
It's been a good life all in all  
It's really fine  
To have the chance to hang around  
And lie there by the fire  
And watch the evening tire  
While all my friends and my old lady  
Sit and pass the pipe around  
  
And talk of poems and prayers and promises  
And things that we believe in  
How sweet it is to love someone  
How right it is to care  
How long it's been since yesterday  
What about tomorrow  
What about our dreams  
And all the memories we share

A country dance was being held in a garden  
I felt a bump and heard an  
Oh, beg your pardon  
Suddenly I saw polka dots and moonbeams  
All around a pug-nosed dream  
  
The music started and was I the perplexed one  
I held my breath and said  
May I have the next one  
In my frightrnrd arms, polka dots and moonbeams  
Sparkled on a pug-nosed dream  
  
There were questions in the eyes of other dancers  
As we floated over the floor  
There were questions but my heart knew all the answers  
And perhaps a few things more  
  
Now in a cottage made of lilacs and laughter  
I know the meaning of the words ever after  
And I'll always see polka dots and moonbeams  
When I kiss my pug-nosed dream

Somewhere out on the prairie  
Is the greatest cowboy that's ever been  
And when he lays his hands upon the ponies  
They shudder with an understanding skin  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
When the storm clouds in the west  
Are quickly gathering  
The ponies they run wild there  
Before it rains  
  
You'll see their sleek dark bodies  
Brightly gleaming  
You know the fire is flying through  
Their brains  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
And he says ponies  
Now ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
  
And he says ponies  
Ponies don't you worry  
I have not come to steal your fire away  
I want to fly with you across the sunrise  
Discover what begins each shining day  
I want to fly
