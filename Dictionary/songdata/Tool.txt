My compassion is broken now.  
My will is eroded,  
And my desire stolen and it makes me feel ugly.  
I'm on my knees and burning.  
My piss and moans are the fuel that set my head on fire.  
So smell my soul burning.  
I'm broken, looking up to see the enemy.  
I have swallowed the poison you feed me  
But I survive on it,  
And it leaves me guilt fed, hatred fed, weakness fed.  
And I feel ugly, and dead inside.  
Shit adds up at the bottom.  
You've left me no choice but to go inside and rebuild  
What's broken.  
Too much, too far, too late to lie down now.  
I must arm myself to fight you  
By making weapons out of my imperfections.  
It's all I have left.  
There's no other choice.  
I'm shameless, nameless, nothing, and no one now.  
But my soul must be iron for my fear is naked.  
I'm naked and fearless.  
But I'm dead inside.  
You see, shit adds up, now I'm dead inside.  
Hatred, weakness, and guilt keep me alive  
At the bottom.

You crawled away from me.  
Slipped away from me.  
I tried to keep a hold,  
But there was nothing I could say.  
You slid and crept away  
And there was nothing I could say.  
So what you're trying to say  
Is you don't wanna play.  
But what you want and what you need  
Doesn't mean fuck to me.  
Because I can see your back is turning.  
If I could I'd stick the knife in.  
This is love.  
This is my love for you.  
Get up.  
Now.  
Say you won't go.

Half a cup of powdered sugar  
One quarter teaspoon salt  
One knife tip Turkish hash  
Half a pound butter  
One teaspoon vanilla-sugar  
Half a pound flour  
A hundred and fifty g ground nuts  
A little extra powdered sugar  
And no eggs  
Place in a bowl  
Add butter  
Add the ground nuts and  
Knead the dough  
Form eyeball-size pieces from the dough  
Roll in the powdered sugar  
And say the Magic Words:  
"Sim sala bim bamba sala do saladim"  
Place on a greased baking pan and  
Bake at two hundred degrees for fifteen minutes  
And no eggs  
Bake at two hundred degrees for fifteen minutes  
And no eggs.

And the angel of the lord came unto me  
snatching me up from my place of slumber.  
And took me on high and higher still  
Until we moved to the spaces betwixt the air itself.  
And he brought me into a vast farmlands of our own midwest.  
And as we descended cries of impending doom rose from the soil.  
One thousand nay a million voices full of fear.  
And terror possessed me then.  
And I begged "Angel of the Lord what are these tortured screams?"  
And the angel said unto me,  
"These are the cries of the carrots, the cries of the carrots!  
You see, Reverend Maynard,  
Tomorrow is harvest day and to them it is the holocaust."  
And I sprang from my slumber drenched in sweat  
Like the tears of one million terrified brothers and roared,  
"Hear me now, I have seen the light!  
They have a consciousness, they have a life, they have a soul!  
Damn you! Let the rabbits wear glasses! Save our brothers!"  
Can I get an amen? Can I get a hallelujah? Thank you Jesus.  
Life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on life feeds on.  
This is necessary.  
It was daylight when you woke up in your ditch.  
You looked up at your sky then.  
That made blue be your color. You had your knife there with you too.  
When you stood up there was goo all over your clothes.  
Your hands were sticky.  
You wiped them on your grass, so now your color was green.  
Oh Lord, why did everything always have to keep changing like this.  
You were already getting nervous again.  
Your head hurt and it rang when you stood up.  
Your head was almost empty.  
It always hurt you when you woke up like this.  
You crawled up out of your ditch onto your gravel road and began to walk,  
waiting for the rest of your mind to come back to you.  
You can see the car parked far down the road and you walked toward it.  
"If God is our Father," you thought, "then Satan must be our cousin."  
Why didn't anyone else understand these important things?  
You got to your car and tried all the doors.  
They were locked. It was a red car and it was new.  
There was an expensive leather camera case laying on the seat.  
Out across your field, you could see two tiny people walking by your woods.  
You began to walk towards them.  
Now red was your color and, of course,  
Those little people out there were yours too.

He had a lot to say.  
He had a lot of nothing to say.  
We'll miss him.  
So long.  
We wish you well.  
You told us how you weren't afraid to die.  
Well then, so long.  
Don't cry.  
Or feel too down.  
Not all martyrs see divinity.  
But at least you tried.  
Standing above the crowd,  
He had a voice that was strong and loud.  
We'll miss him.  
Ranting and pointing his finger  
At everything but his heart.  
We'll miss him.  
No way to recall  
What it was that you had said to me,  
Like I care at all.  
So loud.  
You sure could yell.  
You took a stand on every little thing  
And so loud.  
Standing above the crowd,  
He had a voice so strong and loud and I  
Swallowed his facade cuz I'm so  
Eager to identify with  
Someone above the ground,  
Someone who seemed to feel the same,  
Someone prepared to lead the way, with  
Someone who would die for me.  
Will you? Will you now?  
Would you die for me?  
Don't you fuckin' lie.  
Don't you step out of line.  
Don't you fuckin' lie.  
You've claimed all this time that you would die for me.  
Why then are you so surprised to hear your own eulogy?  
He had a lot to say.  
He had a lot of nothing to say.  
Come down.  
Get off your fuckin' cross.  
We need the fuckin' space to nail the next fool martyr.  
To ascend you must die.  
You must be crucified  
For our sins and our lies  
Goodbye

What's coming through is alive.  
What's holding up is a mirror.  
But what's singing songs is a snake  
Looking to turn this piss to wine.  
They're both totally void of hate,  
But killing me just the same.  
The snake behind me hisses  
What my damage could have been.  
My blood before me begs me  
Open up my heart again.  
And I feel this coming over like a storm again.  
Considerately.  
Venomous voice, tempts me,  
Drains me, bleeds me,  
Leaves me cracked and empty.  
Drags me down like some sweet gravity.  
The snake behind me hisses  
What my damage could have been.  
My blood before me begs me  
Open up my heart again.  
And I feel this coming over like a storm again.  
I am too connected to you to  
Slip away, to fade away.  
Days away I still feel you  
Touching me, changing me,  
And considerately killing me.  
Without the skin,  
Beneath the storm,  
Under these tears  
The walls came down.  
And the snake is drowned and  
As I look in his eyes,  
My fear begins to fade  
Recalling all of those times.  
I could have cried then.  
I should have cried then.  
And as the walls come down and  
As I look in your eyes  
My fear begins to fade  
Recalling all of the times  
I have died  
And will die.  
It's all right.  
I don't mind.  
I am too connected to you to  
Slip away, to fade away.  
Days away I still feel you  
Touching me, changing me,  
And considerately killing me.

Black then white are all I see in my infancy.  
Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.  
Lets me see.  
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine  
Drawn beyond the lines of reason.  
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.  
  
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.  
Withering my intuition, missing opportunities and I must  
Feed my will to feel my moment drawing way outside the lines.  
  
Black then white are all I see in my infancy.  
Red and yellow then came to be, reaching out to me.  
Lets me see there is so much more  
And beckons me to look through to these infinite possibilities.  
As below, so above and beyond, I imagine  
Drawn outside the lines of reason.  
Push the envelope. Watch it bend.  
  
Over thinking, over analyzing separates the body from the mind.  
Withering my intuition leaving all these opportunities behind.  
  
Feed my will to feel this moment urging me to cross the line.  
Reaching out to embrace the random.  
Reaching out to embrace whatever may come.  
  
I embrace my desire to  
Feel the rhythm, to feel connected  
Enough to step aside and weep like a widow  
To feel inspired, to fathom the power,  
To witness the beauty, to bathe in the fountain,  
To swing on the spiral  
Of our divinity and still be a human.  
  
With my feet upon the ground I lose myself  
Between the sounds and open wide to suck it in,  
I feel it move across my skin.  
I'm reaching up and reaching out,  
I'm reaching for the random or what ever will bewilder me.  
And following our will and wind we may just go where no one's been.  
We'll ride the spiral to the end and may just go where no one's been.  
  
Spiral out. Keep going, going

Excuse me? Doctor? Do you have a moment?  
  
A moment? What's the question?  
  
More of a situation, a gentleman in exam 3  
  
What's the problem?  
  
That is the problem, we're not sure  
  
You got the chart?  
  
Right here  
  
Not much here to say  
  
No doctor, no obvious physical trauma. Vitals are stable  
  
Name?  
  
No sir  
  
Did someone drop him off?  
Maybe we could speak to them  
Let's get some background on this fella  
  
No ID. Nothing  
And he won't speak to anybody  
  
Well, let's say hello  
Good morning, I'm Dr. Lawson  
How are you today? How are you today?  
Look son, you're in a safe place  
We wanna help in whatever way we can  
But you need to talk to us  
We can't help you otherwise  
What's happened? Tell me everything

Figlio di puttana, sai che tu sei un pezzo di merda?  
Hm? You think you're cool, right? Hm? Hm?  
When you kicked out people out of your house  
I tell you this, one of three Americans die of cancer,  
You know? Asshole. You're gonna be one of those.  
I don't have the courage  
To kick your ass directly.  
Don't have enough courage for that,  
I could, you know.  
You know you're gonna have another accident?  
You know I'm involved with black magic?  
Fuck you. Die. Bastard.  
You think you're so cool, hm? Asshole.  
And if I ever see your fucking face around,  
In Europe or Italy,  
Well I'll, that time I'm gonna kick your ass.  
Fuck you. Fucking Americans, Yankee.  
You're gonna die outta cancer, I promise.  
Bang bang, deep pain  
No one does what you did to me.  
You wanna know something? Fuck you.  
I want your balls smashed, eat shit. Bastard.  
Pezzo di merda, figlio di puttana.  
I hope somebody in your family dies soon.  
Crepa, pezzo di merda, e vai  
A sucare cazzi su un aereo!  
(1) Son of a bitch, do you know you are a piece of shit?  
(2) Piece of shit, son of a bitch.  
(3) Die, piece of shit, and go suck dicks on a plane!

Choices always were a problem for you.  
What you need is someone strong to guide you.  
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow,  
What you need is someone strong to use you  
Like me,  
Like me.  
If you want to get your soul to heaven,  
Trust in me.  
Don't judge or question.  
You are broken now,  
But faith can heal you.  
Just do everything I tell you to do.  
Deaf and blind and dumb and born to follow.  
Let me lay my holy hand upon you.  
My God's will  
Becomes me.  
When he speaks out,  
He speaks through me.  
He has needs  
Like I do.  
We both want  
To rape you.  
Jesus Christ, why don't you come save my life.  
Open my eyes, blind me with your light now  
And your lies.

We barely remember who or what came before this precious moment,  
We are choosing to be here right now. Hold on, stay inside  
This holy reality, this holy experience.  
Choosing to be here in  
  
This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in  
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal  
All this pain is an illusion.  
  
Alive, I  
  
In this holy reality, in this holy experience. Choosing to be here in  
  
This body. This body holding me. Be my reminder here that I am not alone in  
This body, this body holding me, feeling eternal  
All this pain is an illusion.  
  
Twirling round with this familiar parable.  
Spinning, weaving round each new experience.  
Recognize this as a holy gift and celebrate this chance to be alive and
breathing.  
  
This body holding me reminds me of my own mortality.  
Embrace this moment. Remember. We are eternal.  
All this pain is an illusion.

I know you well.  
You are a part of me.  
I know you better than I know myself.  
I know you best,  
Better than anyone.  
I know you better than I know myself.  
You don't judge.  
You can't speak.  
You can't leave.  
You can't hurt me.  
You're just here for me to use.  
I know you best,  
Better than one might think.  
I know you better than I know myself.  
It's time for you  
To make a sacrifice.  
It's time to die a little.  
Give it up.  
You are a part of me.

I will choke until I swallow  
Choke this infant here before me.  
What is this but my reflection?  
Who am I to judge and strike you down?  
But you're  
Pushing and shoving me.  
You still love me and you pushit on me.  
Rest your trigger on my finger,  
Bang my head upon the fault line.  
Take care not to make me enter.  
Cause if I do we both may disappear.  
But you're pushing me,  
Shoving me. Pushit on me.  
Slipping back into the gap again.  
I'm alive when you're touching me,  
Alive when you're shoving me down.  
But I'd trade it all  
For just a little bit of  
Piece of mind.  
Put me somewhere I don't wanna be.  
Seeing someplace I don't wanna see.  
Never wanna see that place again.  
Saw that gap again today  
As you were begging me to stay.  
Managed to push myself away,  
And you, as well.  
If, when I say I may fade like a sigh if I stay,  
You minimize my movement anyway,  
I must persuade you another way.  
There's no love in fear.  
Staring down the hole again.  
Hands upon my back again.  
Survival is my only friend.  
Terrified of what may come.  
Just remember I will always love you,  
Even as I tear your fucking throat away.  
But it will end no other way.

I have come curiously close to the end, down  
Beneath my self-indulgent pitiful hole,  
Defeated, I concede and  
Move closer  
I may find comfort here  
I may find peace within the emptiness  
How pitiful  
  
It's calling me  
  
And in my darkest moment, fetal and weeping  
The moon tells me a secret, my confidant  
As full and bright as I am  
This light is not my own and  
A million light reflections pass over me  
  
Its source is bright and endless  
She resuscitates the hopeless  
Without her, we are lifeless satellites drifting  
  
And as I pull my head out I am without one doubt  
Don't want to be down here feeding my narcissism.  
I must crucify the ego before it's far too late  
I pray the light lifts me out  
Before I pine away.  
  
So crucify the ego, before it's far too late  
To leave behind this place so negative and blind and cynical,  
And you will come to find that we are all one mind  
Capable of all that's imagined and all conceivable.  
Just let the light touch you  
And let the words spill through  
And let them pass right through  
Bringing out our hope and reason  
Before we pine away.

Angels on the sideline  
Puzzled and amused.  
Why did Father give these humans free will?  
Now they're all confused.  
  
Don't these talking monkeys know that Eden has enough to go around?  
Plenty in this holy garden, silly old monkeys,  
Where there's one you're bound to divide it  
Right in two  
  
Angels on the sideline  
Baffled and confused  
Father blessed them all with reason.  
And this is what they choose.  
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground  
  
Silly monkeys give them thumbs,  
They forge a blade, and where there's one they're bound to divide it  
Right in two.  
Right in two.  
  
Monkey killing monkey killing monkey over pieces of the ground  
Silly monkeys give them thumbs, they make a club  
And beat their brother down.  
How they survive so misguided is a mystery.  
Repugnant is a Creature who would squander the ability  
To lift an eye to heaven, conscious of his fleeting time here  
  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
  
Fight over the clouds, over wind, over sky and  
Fight over life, over blood, over air and light,  
Over love, over sun, over another.  
Fight for the time, for the one, for the rise and  
  
Angels on the sideline again  
Been so long with patience and reason  
Angels on the sideline again  
Wondering when this tug of war will end  
  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Cut and divide it all right in two  
Right in two  
Right in two

I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them fall away  
Mildewed and smoldering. Fundamental differing.  
Pure intention juxtaposed will set two lovers souls in motion  
Disintegrating as it goes testing our communication  
The light that fueled our fire then has burned a hole between us so  
We cannot see to reach an end crippling our communication.  
I know the pieces fit 'cause I watched them tumble down  
No fault, none to blame it doesn't mean I don't desire to  
Point the finger, blame the other, watch the temple topple over.  
To bring the pieces back together, rediscover communication  
The poetry that comes from the squaring off between,  
And the circling is worth it.  
Finding beauty in the dissonance.  
There was a time that the pieces fit, but I watched them fall away.  
Mildewed and smoldering, strangled by our coveting  
I've done the math enough to know the dangers of our second guessing  
Doomed to crumble unless we grow, and strengthen our communication.  
Cold silence has a tendency to atrophy any  
Sense of compassion  
Between supposed lovers  
I know the pieces fit

There's a shadow just behind me,  
Shrouding every step I take,  
Making every promise empty,  
Pointing every finger at me.  
Waiting like a stalking butler  
Who upon the finger rests.  
Murder now the path called "must we"  
Just before the son has come.  
Jesus, won't you fucking whistle  
Something but the past and done?  
Why can't we not be sober?  
I just want to start this over.  
Why can't we drink forever.  
I just want to start things over.  
I am just a worthless liar.  
I am just an imbecile.  
I will only complicate you.  
Trust in me and fall as well.  
I will find a center in you.  
I will chew it up and leave,  
I will work to elevate you  
Just enough to bring you down.  
Trust me.  
Mother Mary won't you whisper  
Something but what's past and done.  
Trust me.  
I want what I want.

Something has to change.  
Un-deniable dilemma.  
Boredom's not a burden  
Anyone should bear.  
Constant over stimulation numbs me  
And I wouldn't have  
It any other way.  
It's not enough.  
I need more.  
Nothing seems to satisfy.  
I don't want it.  
I just need it.  
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.  
Finger deep within the borderline.  
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.  
Relax, turn around and take my hand.  
I can help you change  
Tired moments into pleasure.  
Say the word and we'll be  
Well upon our way.  
Blend and balance  
Pain and comfort  
Deep within you  
Till you will not want me any other way.  
It's not enough.  
I need more.  
Nothing seems to satisfy.  
I don't want it.  
I just need it.  
To breathe, to feel, to know I'm alive.  
Knuckle deep inside the borderline.  
This may hurt a little but it's something you'll get used to.  
Relax. Slip away.  
Something kinda sad about  
The way that things have come to be.  
Desensitized to everything.  
What became of subtlety?  
How can it mean anything to me  
If I really don't feel anything at all?  
I'll keep digging till  
I feel something.  
Elbow deep inside the borderline.  
Show me that you love me and that we belong together.  
Shoulder deep within the borderline.  
Relax. Turn around and take my hand.

My warning meant nothing.  
You're dancing in quicksand.  
Why don't you watch where you're wandering?  
Why don't you watch where you're stumbling?  
You're wading knee deep and going in.  
And you may never come back again.  
This bog is thick and easy to get lost in  
When you're a stupid, dumb ass, belligerent fucker.  
I hope it sucks you down.  
Wander in and wandering.  
No one even invited you in.  
But still you stumble in stumbling.  
So suffocate  
Or get out while you can.  
No one told you to come.  
I hope it sucks you down.

I'm sweating,  
And breathing  
And staring and thinking  
And sinking  
Deeper.  
It's almost like I'm swimming.  
The sun is burning hot again  
On the hunter  
And the fisherman,  
And he's trying to remember when,  
But it makes him dizzy.  
Seems like I've been here before.  
Seems so familiar.  
Seems like I'm slipping  
Into a dream within a dream.  
Must be the way you whisper.  
The sun is setting cool again.  
I'm the thinker  
And the fisherman  
And I'm trying to remember when  
But it makes me dizzy.  
And I'm sweating,  
And breathing,  
And staring and thinking  
And sinking  
Deeper  
And it's almost like I'm swimming.  
Seems like I've been here before.  
Seems so familiar.  
Seems like I'm slipping  
Into a dream within a dream.  
It's the way you whisper.  
It drags me under  
And takes me home.

Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.  
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.  
Desperate to control all and everything.  
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.  
  
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.  
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.  
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.  
Terrified of being wrong. Ultimatum prison cell.  
  
Saturn ascends, choose one or ten. Hang on or be humbled again.  
  
Clutch it like a cornerstone. Otherwise it all comes down.  
Justify denials and grip 'em to the lonesome end.  
Saturn ascends, comes round again.  
Saturn ascends, the one, the ten. Ignorant to the damage done.  
  
Wear the grudge like a crown of negativity.  
Calculate what we will or will not tolerate.  
Desperate to control all and everything.  
Unable to forgive your scarlet lettermen.  
  
Wear the grudge like a crown. Desperate to control.  
Unable to forgive. And we're sinking deeper.  
  
Defining, confining, controlling, and we're sinking deeper.  
  
Saturn comes back around to show you everything  
Let's you choose what you will not see and then  
Drags you down like a stone or lifts you up again  
Spits you out like a child, light and innocent.  
  
Saturn comes back around. Lifts you up like a child or  
Drags you down like a stone  
To consume you till you choose to let this go.  
  
Give away the stone.  
Let the oceans take and trans mutate this cold and fated anchor.  
Give away the stone.  
Let the waters kiss and trans mutate these leaden grudges into gold.  
Let go.

Who are you to wave your finger?  
You must have been out your head  
Eye hole deep in muddy waters  
You practically raised the dead  
  
Rob the grave to snow the cradle  
Then burn the evidence down  
Soapbox, house of cards, and glass  
So don't go tossin' your stones around  
  
You must have been high  
You must have been high  
You must have been  
  
Foot in mouth, and head up ass  
So what you talkin' 'bout?  
Difficult to dance 'round this one  
Till you pull it out, boy  
  
You must have been so high  
You must have been so high  
  
Steal, burrow, reefer  
Save your shady inference  
Kangaroo done hung the juror with the innocent  
  
Now you're weeping shades of cozen indigo  
Got lemon juice up in your eye  
When you pissed all over my black kettle  
You must have been high, high  
You must have been high, high  
  
Who are you to wave your finger?  
So full of it  
Eyeballs deep in muddy waters  
Fucking hypocrite  
  
Liar, lawyer, mirror show me  
What's the difference?  
Kangaroo done hung the guilty with the innocent  
  
Now you're weeping shades of cozen indigo  
Got lemon juice up in your eye  
When you pissed all over my black kettle  
  
You must have been  
  
So who are you to wave your finger?  
Who are you to wave your fat fingers at me?  
You must have been out your mind  
  
Weeping shades of indigo  
Trapped without a reason  
Weeping shades of indigo  
  
Liar, lawyer, mirror for you  
What's the difference?  
Kangaroo be stoned  
He's guilty as the government  
  
Now you're weeping shades of cozen indigo  
Got lemon juice up in your eye  
When you pissed all over my black kettle  
  
You must have been high, high, high, high  
  
Eyeballs deep in bloody waters  
You're balls deep in muddy waters  
Ganja? Please!  
You must have been out your mind
