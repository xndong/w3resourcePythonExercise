Oh oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky  
I need you to shine in my life  
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time  
Better believe it  
  
Oh oh, whenever you're not in my presence  
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah  
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night  
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah  
  
You think I'm biased  
To my significant other  
You hit it right on the head  
Only been missing my lover  
Got a whole lotta texts in my phone and I don't reply  
The next eight bars tell you why  
  
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah,  
Ain't worried about nobody else  
If it ain't you, I ain't myself  
You make me complete  
  
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah,  
What's a king bed without a queen  
There ain't no "I" in team  
You make me complete  
You're all that matters to me  
  
Take the gas out the car it won't drive  
That's how I feel when you're not by my side  
When I wake up in the morning up under you, and only you  
  
Oh oh, grateful for your existence  
Faithful no matter the distance  
You're the only girl I see  
From the bottom of my heart, please believe  
  
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah  
Ain't worried about nobody else  
If it ain't you, I ain't myself  
You make me complete  
You're all that matters to me, yeah, yeah  
What's a king bed without a queen  
There ain't no "I" in team  
You make me complete  
You're all that matters to me  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're all that matters to me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You're all that matters to me

Ooh whoa, ooh whoa, ooh whoa  
You know you love me, you know you care  
Just shout whenever and I'll be there  
You are my love, you are my heart  
And we will never, ever, ever be apart  
  
Are we an item? Girl quit playin'  
We're just friends, what are you sayin'  
Said there's another, look right in my eyes  
My first love, broke my heart for the first time  
  
And I was like baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no  
Like baby, baby, baby oh  
I thought you'd always be mine (Mine)  
Baby, baby, baby oh  
Like baby, baby, baby no

Oh for you, I would have done whatever  
And I just can't believe we ain't together  
And I wanna play it cool  
But I'm losin' you  
I'll buy you anything  
I'll buy you any ring  
And I'm in pieces, baby fix me  
And just shake me, til you wake me from this bad dream  
I'm goin' down, down, down, down  
And I can't believe my first love won't be around

Baby, baby, baby oh

Luda, when I was thirteen, I had my first love  
There was nobody that compared to my baby  
And nobody came between us no one could ever come above  
She had me goin' crazy  
Oh I was starstruck  
She woke me up daily  
Don't need no Starbucks  
She made my heart pound  
And skip a beat when I see her in the street and  
At school on the playground  
But I really wanna see her on the weekend  
She know she got me dazin'  
'Cause she was so amazin'  
And now my heart is breakin'  
But I just keep on sayin'  
  
Baby, baby, baby oh

Gone, gone, gone I'm gone gone

Across the ocean, across the sea,  
Starting to forget the way you look at me now  
Over the mountains, across the sky,  
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes  
  
Through the storm and through the clouds  
Bumps on the road and upside down now  
I know it's hard, babe, to sleep at night  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the sorrow, and the fights,  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
All alone, in my room  
Waiting for your phone call to come soon  
And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles,  
To be in your arms, holding my heart  
  
Oh I,  
Oh I,  
I love you  
And everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the long nights  
And the bright lights  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
You know that I care for you  
I'll always be there for you  
I promise I will stay right here, yeah  
  
I know that you want me too,  
Baby we can make it through anything  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the sorrow, and the fights,  
Don't you worry  
'Cause everything's gonna be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
Be alright, ai-ai-ai-aight  
  
Through the sorrow, and the fights,  
Don't you worry  
Everything's gonna be alright

Believe, believe, believe

I knew it wouldn't be easy  
But your faith in me was so clear  
It didn't matter how many times I got knocked on the floor  
But you knew one day I would be standing tall  
Just look at me now  
  
'Cause everything starts from something  
But something would be nothing  
Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me  
Where would I be, if, if you didn't believe  
Believe

There were nights when I was doubting myself  
But your kept my heart from foldin'

You knew one day I would be standing tall  
And just look at us now

Nothing if your heart didn't dream with me  
Where would I be, if, if you didn't believe

Would you know, how it feels  
To touch the sky, if you didn't believe  
Believe, believe, yeah

Gotta believe in me  
Believe me like a fairytale

And know I won't I won't  
Ever ever let you down (no)  
Like a seesaw let you down (oh)  
You know why  
'Cause we ain't in the playground no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
Whoa oh  
Remember when my heart was young  
You were still bigger than me  
Is that the reason that you stayed  
Most would've got rid of me  
Now the bully's in the school yard  
Can't take our hugs and our kisses from us  
Because we ain't pushovers no more baby  
  
We're big enough  
To stand in the picture  
We're big enough  
To stand next to love  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
  
(Remember those stroll down street) I remember that  
(Don't like Edle Lane?) Like yesterday  
(They shine on me) We were little then  
(In class I dreamed about you) My baby  
You wow wow (You wow wow)  
Since then all I can remember is the love only got bigger  
  
I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,

I was a player  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
A heart-breaker  
When I was little  
But now I'm bigger  
I'm bigger  
And all the haters  
I swear they look so small from up here  
'Cause we're bigger,  
And love's bigger,  
I'm bigger and you're bigger  
Oh

Verse 1:  
I messed up the first part of our love. I messed up our relationship. I know
what we had came from above. But I don't know if this is it. Every day I talk
to your picture. Hangin on my wall. Sayin how much I miss her, I miss it
all...  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
Verse 2:  
I messed up your life. I messed up my time. I know what we had was all right.
But I don't know if you cry at night. Sayin to your parents, saying I am bad.
Telling them. "he was all that I had."  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
Verse 3:  
What we had is dead and gone. It will be too long. Before me and you are
together. But I guess not anymore...  
  
Chorus:  
All the girls are laughing, while I am crying, saying to myself I shouldn't
have let you go. All the girls are fine, and I'm losin time, but I just can't
get you off my mind.  
  
(Yeah) (yeah) woahhhh! (yeah) (yeah) can't get you off my mind.

[Verse:]  
I just sit here waiting for you to call  
Then I wonder if you're even calling at all  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I'm still sitting here waiting for much more (Text me or something)  
I can't take this, I'm walking out that door  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Verse 3:]  
I pack up my things and get on that plane  
Cause without you I can't be tamed  
So many thought go through my mind  
Wish you can be here all the time  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just live without you  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
[Bridge:]  
Please girl stay with me  
My heart is waiting for you  
I can't take this no more  
There's nothing I should do  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without  
  
I'm breathing in, I'm breathing out  
Being with you is just no doubt  
I'm going crazy and there's nothing I should do  
I can't, Can't live without you  
  
Cause I'm lost without you and I can't just doubt you  
And there's everything about you, I just can't live without you

The sun comes up on another morning  
My mind never wakes up without you on it  
And it's crazy to me, I even see you in my dreams  
Is this meant to be? Could be happening to me?  
  
We were best of friends since we were this high  
So why do I get nervous every time you walk by  
We would be on the phone all day  
Now I can't find the words to say to you  
Now what I'm supposed to do  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
In my head we're already together  
I'm cool alone, but with you I'm better  
I just wanna see you smile  
You say the word and I'll be right there  
I ain't never going nowhere  
  
I'm just trying to see where this can take us  
'Cause everything about you girl is so contagious  
I think I finally got it done  
Now it's left to do now, lets get out the mirror  
And say it to her, her yeah  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
Should I tell her how I really feel (how I really feel)  
Or should I moving closer just be still  
How would I know?  
'Cause if I take a chance, and I touch her hand  
Will everything change?  
How do I know if she feels the same?  
  
Could there be a possibility  
I'm trying to say what's up  
'Cause I'm made for you, and you for me  
Baby now is time for us  
Shall I give it all together  
But enough is enough  
They say we're too young for love  
But I'm catching feelings, catching feelings  
  
Catching feelings, catching feelings

[Verse]  
What about the children?  
Look at all the children we can change  
What about a vision?  
Be a visionary for a change  
We're the generation  
Who's gonna be the one to fight for it?  
We're the inspiration  
Do you believe enough to die for it?  
  
[Chorus]  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Who's got the heart? Who's got it?  
Whose heart is the biggest?  
Wear it on your sleeve  
Bet we can make a difference  
Oh yeah  
  
Who's got the heart?  
Oh yeah

Hello!

It's a holiday  
Spend it with you baby  
I think that I am in love this Christmas, yeah  
Just hang your stockings on the fireplace  
You know that Santa's coming to town  
I'm the one who wants to take you on a sleigh, right now  
  
So today is all about you babe  
The mistletoe can pull us closer  
It's what I'm waiting for  
It sorta feels like it's Valentine's, Valentine's  
  
So in on top of your roof  
Them sleigh bells is ringing  
I'll be up all night with you  
Don't care what they're saying  
Japan to Peru, baby me and you  
This Christmas Eve  
  
Be my date this Christmas Eve  
Be my holiday, my dream  
Lay your head on me  
I got you babe, whoa oh  
  
Kissing underneath the tree  
I don't need no presents girl  
You're everything I need  
Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
You leave some cookies out,  
I'ma eat 'em up  
Nobody can see me but you  
It's so magical  
  
When we use imagination,  
We can fly to never never land  
The North Pole, ain't that cold  
If you wanna go  
I got you baby  
  
Be my date this Christmas Eve  
Be my holiday, my dream  
Lay your head on me

Let me give you all of me  
Together on this Christmas Eve  
  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve  
Be my, be my, Christmas Eve

I can see  
All the children around the world  
Crying tears of deceit  
And their parents are to blame  
Christmas is dead  
And that children should cry no more  
All of it is just fake  
There's no sense to believing in  
Putting your kids health at risk  
And its causing mental illnesses around the world  
So, Christmas is dead  
And pretend its just another day  
  
Santa claus is fake  
And children will cry  
In order to admit the truth  
When you say Christmas is the perfect time of year  
I should put you to the test  
I will say  
You are careless  
That's wrong  
And you'll understand  
How the truth will set you free and change you  
Christmas is dead

Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away  
  
Tv light of blue and white  
Just can't fall asleep at night  
Move over to the space where you should be  
Even half way seem so far  
Over mountains and diamond stars  
Everybody has their own way home  
  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
All my life I've dreamed of love  
Never thought it would hurt this much  
To kiss goodbye and wait for your return  
So I'll be strong and hold on to  
A picture and a thought of you  
Getting all the love that you deserve  
  
So come home to me  
Come home to me  
Back into my arms  
Home where you belong  
Come home to me  
Come home to me  
If home is where you are  
Home is way too far away  
  
If home is where you are  
Then home is way too far away

Just a fraction of your love  
Fills the air  
And I fall in love with you  
All over again, woo woo woo  
You're the light that feeds the sun  
In my world  
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl  
Out of all the things in life that I could fear  
The only thing that would hurt me,  
Is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't wanna go back to just being one half of the equation  
You understand what I'm sayin'?  
Girl, without you I'm lost  
Can't face this compass at heart  
Between me and love,  
You're the common denominator  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Common denominator  
Oh, yeah, woa  
  
Before you're love was low  
Playing girls was my high  
We chase the game that would put  
My cot in the side, aye  
When broken hearts rise up to say,  
Love is a lie  
You and I would stand to be love's reply  
  
Out of all things in life that I could fear, yeah  
The only thing that would hurt me is if you weren't here, whoa  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can't imagine life without your touch  
And every kiss that you give, can fill me up  
And to all the heart aching  
Jealous females hatin'  
Imma hold it down for you, you  
You, woah, oh, woah  
You're the common denominator  
Oh yeah woah  
  
I don't wanna go back  
I don't want to go back  
To just being one half of the equation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just a fraction of your love fills the air  
And I fall in love with you all over again

Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright,  
Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright  
  
Say you love me  
As much as I love you yeah  
Would you hurt me baby  
Could you do that to me yeah  
Would you lie to me baby  
'Cause the truth hurts so much more  
Would you do the things that drive me crazy  
Leave my heart still at the door?  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl  
  
(Mhm, uh huh, yeah yeah, alright) Ooh, baby I know loving you ain't easy  
But it sure is worth a try  
  
Ooh, if there is a reason to call me a fool  
'Cause I love too hard  
Are there any rules baby  
If this a lesson  
Then baby teach me to behave  
Just tell me what I gotta do  
Just to stay right next to you  
  
Oh, I can't help it I'm just selfish  
There's no way that I could share you  
That would break my heart to pieces  
Honestly the truth is  
  
If I could just die in your arms  
I wouldn't mind  
'Cause every time you touch me  
I just die in your arms  
Ooh, it feels so right  
So baby baby please don't stop girl

We've both been waiting so long  
For this day to come  
Now that it's here lets make it special  
I can't deny  
There's so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJ's playing my favorite song ain't no chaperon's this could be  
The night of our dreams  
  
Only if you give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give your first dance to me  
I'm gonna cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a life time  
  
I couldn't ask for more, we're rockin' back and forth  
Under the disco ball, we're the only ones on the floor  
(I can't deny), so many thoughts in my mind  
The DJ's playing my favorite song, now we're all alone, here's the opportunity  
  
Only if you give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle, I know we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give your first dance to me

Everybody says that we look cute together lets make this a night  
The two us remember, no teachers around to see us dancin' close  
I'm tellin' you our parents will never know  
Before the lights go up and the music turns off  
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss,  
Your glass slippers in my hand right here, we'll  
Make it before the clock strikes nine  
  
If you just give, give the first dance to me  
Girl I promise I'll be gentle but we gotta do it slowly  
If you give, give the first dance to me we'll cherish every moment,  
It only happens once, once in a lifetime

No complaining only moaning  
  
Dominicans, Puerto Rican, you know they do it for me  
See me in a Ferrari where my where my madder thing is from  
If it has some wings, we'd be flying, we'd be soaring  
Ah-ah-ah  
When I'm in it I'll be thinking I don't want this thing to stop  
No-o-o  
But I'm thinking that you're winning if you make it to the top  
That probably means you make me feel some type of way  
Shout-out Miami for having so many foreign babes  
  
She only been here for two weeks  
Came with the girls and they tryna leave with me  
She workin' hard like she tryna get a visa  
The way she twerk it I just might pull out my Visa

I have often dreamed  
Of a far off place  
Where a hero's welcome  
Would be waiting for me  
Where the crowds will cheer  
When they see my face  
And a voice keeps saying  
This is where I'm meant to be  
  
I'll be there someday  
I can go the distance  
I will find my way  
If I can be strong  
I know ev'ry mile  
Will be worth my while  
When I go the distance  
I'll be right where I belong  
  
Down an unknown road  
To embrace my fate  
Though that road may wander  
It will lead me to you  
And a thousand years  
Would be worth the wait  
It might take a lifetime  
But somehow I'll see it through  
  
And I won't look back  
I can go the distance  
And I'll stay on track  
No, I won't accept defeat  
It's an uphill slope  
But I won't lose hope  
'Till I go the distance  
And my journey is complete  
  
But to look beyond the glory is the hardest part  
For a hero's strength is measured by his heart  
  
Like a shooting star  
I will go the distance  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
I don't care how far  
I can go the distance  
'Till I find my hero's welcome  
Waiting in your arms  
  
I will search the world  
I will face it's harms  
'Till I find my hero's welcome  
Waiting in your arms

Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
Don't be afraid to stand alone  
Don't be afraid to stand outside all by yourself  
I know it's hard away from home  
It ain't easy all alone  
Relationships over the phone  
Talkin' to your significant other all night long  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
  
[Pooh Bear]  
Should've been adjusted to my life  
Had the opportunity to stay and wait for the last time  
Now you're standin' right in front of me  
It is mean and though, that life  
Try to protect your feelins  
Givin' in between the lines  
Hope your heart is totally healed and  
  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality  
Even though you might get mad at me  
Sometimes it's hard to face reality

But yesterday we were  
I don't understand?  
  
We started out it was perfect  
Nothing but fun  
And my heart was convinced  
To say that you're the one  
  
And I thought it would last the rest of our lives  
Boy was I in for a big surprise,  
With no doubt looking round  
Thinking that I'm so cool  
  
Same place, same time  
Every day of my life could we meet after school  
Finally if I didn't make her cry  
She wouldn't be with another guy  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Now I'm all tore up taking up  
When I was at your door  
For the first time when you said  
Forever I'll be yours  
Started walking your hand in my hand  
Feelings got stronger  
  
We made a promise.  
  
And whenever I leave it feels like you're still with me  
But it all came crashing down  
Sitting in my room  
I gotta get out of here  
What am I to do when I look up  
And you're not there.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Say I'm to young for love  
I got so much live to live ahead  
But if only this love?  
I could get over  
I know I have to deal with the pain.  
  
Nothing can cure my headache  
Cause I'm experiencing  
What they call heartbreak  
It's going to hurt worse  
As long as I stay here  
I know but man just let me lay here.  
  
Cause this is something that I can't shake  
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak  
They say it's only just as worse as you make it  
I know but man just let me lay here

[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you love me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Verse]  
I close my eyes, I take it slow  
Lay on down and let me rest my soul  
I've been so high, I've been so low  
I'm just tryna find my way back home  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Can't help but roam  
My signal's gone  
Guess this journey's left me on my own  
I don't care why  
I'm alone, alone, alone  
  
[Chorus]  
And if I could  
Forget about the way you loved me  
Forget about the world we set in stone  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
I never thought that I'd be broken  
I never thought I'd be this far from home  
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
If only I could hit the ground  
  
[Bridge]  
Take it one day at a time  
Reach for the stars now  
Ooh just leave the past behind  
That's a part of living, woah  
That's a part of living, woah, oh yeah  
  
[Outro]  
If only I could hit the ground  
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be falling down  
Yeah, woah if only I could hit it  
If only I could hit the ground  
If I could hit the ground  
Then I'd be touching down  
If only I could hit the ground

Every birthday, every birthday  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
  
Don't let this go to your head  
But you're the best, I've ever had  
Not to mention  
That thing is swollen  
You got me oh so in a trance  
  
Something like a Ziploc, but a lip lock  
Want you wrapped around my arm like a wrist watch  
Oh, so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
  
Got me tossing, turning in the bed  
Your place is where I rather be instead  
You don't know your strength  
Missing you is like adrenaline  
Oh, when you got me in a gridlock  
What a great spot  
Yeah, that turned up kind of love and it just won't stop  
No, so hard walking out  
Got me stuck like crazy glue, ooh babe  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go, no babay  
  
Holding back the faces I would make  
I'm a fan and you're the rock star  
Making it hard on me  
Visualize a monster  
'Cause you're too bad for me  
Shot that arrow, I'm hit  
Need you right near me  
Trying to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away (no, no)  
I try to maintain, so don't mind if I turn away  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go  
(Lips won't let me go, lips won't let me go, oh)  
  
They hold on tight  
Yeah, they hold on tight  
Ooh, they hold on tight  
Them lips won't let me go

Looking out the window  
Waiting for your headlights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight  
You're scared that I won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Pacing down the hallway  
Trying to fight the urge to call  
I could almost hear a pin drop  
'Cept for the clock on the wall  
And I'm scared you won't make it through the storm  
You should be here with me, safe and warm  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
I'm praying that you make it home tonight  
So we can lay down by the fireside  
You and I till Christmas morning  
There's nothing else that I want this year  
More than just to have you here, whoa  
I'll be waiting  
  
I'll be waiting under the mistletoe  
While you're driving here through the winter snow  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
When the only gift that I really need  
Is to have your arms wrapped around me  
Baby think of me if it helps to get you home  
Home this Christmas  
  
Looking out the window  
Waiting for your head lights  
To pull up in the driveway  
It's really coming down tonight

Verse 1:  
The strands in your eyes  
They color them wonderful  
Stop me was stealing my breath  
The emeralds from mountains  
The thrust toward the sky  
Never revealing their depth  
Tell me  
That we belong together  
Dress it up with the trappings of love  
I'll be captivated  
I'll hang from your lips  
Instead of the gallows of heartbreak  
That hang from above  
  
Chorus:  
And i'll be you're crying shoulder  
I'll be love suicide  
And i'll be better when I'm older  
I'll be the greatest fan of your life

Verse 2:  
I've dropped out

On the way to the mattress, said she loved the Panamera  
In the trap with J-B with my phone chirpin' like beepers

He never seen a nigga like me  
Hoppin' out the Chevy, step up with the minks, gold chain, Mr. T

Would tell you 'bout my mansion but I bet they watching me  
I'm a vegetarian, all I want is some lettuce and some broccoli  
Mansion out in Beverly, your bitch calling me call me your majesty  
  
[Verse 5: Offset]  
My bitch is so gorgeous, I might pay her mortgage  
I run to the money like Forrest  
My life is historic  
Travel 'round the world like I'm in orbit  
I take your bitch and dunk her like Ben Gordon  
I watch her like a telescope  
I beat it and kill it like I'm Lil Terrio  
I got your bitch, she watching me like Tyler Perry shows  
I'm young and always riding in a Phantom Ghost  
I paint a picture for niggas like Michelangelo

[Verse 1]  
For all the times that you rain on my parade  
And all the clubs you get in using my name  
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness' sake  
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Verse 2]  
But when you told me that you hated my friends  
The only problem was with you and not them  
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong  
And tried to make me forget where I came from  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
And I didn't wanna write a song cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still
care  
I don't but, you still hit my phone up  
And baby I be movin' on and I think you should be somethin'  
I don't wanna hold back, maybe you should know that  
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone  
And I never like to admit that I was wrong  
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on  
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
  
[Bridge]  
For all the times that you made me feel small  
I fell in love, now I fear nothin' at all  
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable  
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself  
Cause if you like the way you look that much  
Oh baby you should go and love yourself  
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'  
You should go and love yourself

[Verse 1]  
Love is in the air  
Candles all around us  
There's no need to see, nothing, nothing  
Baby I'm yours, yours until forever  
Cause you know that I would never ever want this to change  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love, yeah  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love  
Madly in love babe  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
  
[Verse 2]  
Babe, you are the reason to breathe  
And babe, you know you're all that I need  
Remember when you took my hand  
And ran away (it was just us two babe)  
And wandered off to Chinatown  
Laughing 'bout nothing at all  
When I look into your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love, yeah  
It's all about the magic  
All about the madness in your eyes  
Madly in love  
Madly in love babe  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
Madly in love  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)  
(Madly in love)

She says she met me on a tour  
She keeps knocking on my door,  
She won't leave me, leave me alone  
This girl she wouldn't stop, almost had to call the cops  
She was scheming, ooh, she was wrong

And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection

Now she's in the magazines, on TV, making a scene  
Oh she's crazy, crazy in love  
And she's all over the news, saying everything but the truth  
She's faking, faking it all  
  
'Cause she wanted all my attention, yeah  
And she was dragging my name through the dirt, no  
She was dying for my affection  
But she got mad 'cause I didn't give it to her  
  
I'm talking to you, Maria  
Why you wanna do me like that?

[Chorus]  
Mark my words, that's all that I have  
Mark my words, give you all I got  
In every way I will  
You're the only reason why  
Oh I don't wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words  
  
[Verse]  
So you heard it all before  
Falling in and out of trust  
Trying to rekindle us  
Only to lose yourself  
But I won't let me lose you  
And I won't let us just fade away  
After all that we've been through  
I'ma show you more than I ever could say  
  
[Chorus]  
Mark my words, that's all that I have  
Mark my words, give you all I got  
In every way I will  
You're the only reason why  
Oh I don't wanna live a lie  
Mark my words  
Mark my words

It's the most beautiful time of the year  
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
I don't wanna miss out on the holiday, but I can't stop starin' at your face  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
  
Everyone's gatherin' around the fire  
Chestnuts roastin' like a hot July  
I should be chillin' with my folks I know, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
Word on the street Santa's comin' tonight  
Reindeer flyin' through the sky so high  
I should be makin' a list I know, but I'ma be under the mistletoe  
  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, shawty with you  
With you, under the mistletoe  
  
Aye love, the Wisemen follow the star, the way I follow my heart  
And it lead me to a miracle, hey love  
Don't ya buy me nothin', 'cause I am feelin' one thing  
Your lips on my lips, that's a merry merry Christmas  
  
It's the most beautiful time of the year  
Lights fill the streets, spreadin' so much cheer  
I should be playin' in the winter snow, but I'ma be under the mistletoe

Oh oh oh yeah yeah yeah  
Kiss me underneath the mistletoe, show me baby that you love me so oh oh

Ooh no, ooh no, ooh  
They say that hate has been sent  
So let loose the talk of love  
Before they outlaw the kiss  
Baby give me one last hug  
  
There's a dream  
That I've been chasing  
Want so badly for it to be reality  
(Reality, reality)  
And when you hold my hand  
Then I understand  
That it's meant to be  
  
Cause baby when you're with me  
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven  
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)  
Cause when I stare in your eyes  
It couldn't be better  
(Don't want you to go oh no so)

Cause this life's to long  
And this love's to strong  
So baby know for sure  
That I'll never let you go  
  
I got my favorite girl  
Not feelin' no pain or fear  
(Pain or fear, pain or fear, no pain)  
Oh no, don't have a care in the world  
Why would I, when you are here  
(You are here, you are here)  
There's a moment I've been chasin'  
And I finally caught it out on this floor  
(On this floor, in this floor)  
  
Baby, there's no hesitation,  
No reservation by taking a chance and more  
Oh no, because  
  
It's like an angel came by, and took me to heaven  
(It's like you took me to heaven girl)  
Cause when I stare in your eyes  
It couldn't be better

Take my hand, lets just dance  
Watch my feet, follow me  
Don't be scared, girl I'm here  
If you didn't know, this is love  
  
(Let the music blast)

[Intro: Kyla]  
Baby I like your style  
  
[Verse 1: Justin Bieber]  
Lips on your neck  
We're never too close now  
Nothing like you and me  
I don't know your name  
But I'm sure that you know me  
A little life with the music  
The feeling is mutual  
Loving the way you move on me  
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed  
And you're all that I can see  
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money  
And when this song comes on, you know  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
I need a one dance  
1942 in my hand  
One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me  
  
[Verse 2: Justin Bieber]  
You know, I like that you're wild  
So make your way over here right now

Celebrate life with me babe  
Don't be in a rush to go now  
Oh girl  
  
[Chorus: Justin Bieber]  
I need a one dance

One more time 'fore I go  
Body lockin', put a hold on me

[Verse 1: justin bieber]  
Damn damn j.b, where the hell you been  
Yeah I got a new necklace, diamonds  
2 big face rollies, no I ain't lyin'  
Making momma so proud that she cryin'  
Yeah you say I'm crazy? guess that makes two  
But I never knew that dreams really came true  
Started playing drums, when I was only 2  
Now we kick it in japan, kung-fu  
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating  
I swear otis redding will be oh-so ready  
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with kenny  
And we steady getting many, I mean money  
Riding in an all-black benz with the all black rims  
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses  
  
[Justin bieber]  
Wait... I'm not done  
  
[Verse 2: justin bieber]  
I thanked jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell  
Call me zack morris I'm saving you by the bell  
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves them perfect persons  
Perfectly personally I think she is perfectly perfect  
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me  
I swear I got honey bee's cause baby I'm a money tree  
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny  
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y  
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible  
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically  
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally  
There's a bigger me inside this little me  
Screaming out, I should make history  
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me  
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me  
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory  
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?  
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos  
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot  
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time  
Playing with camera claiming that "it's not mine"  
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry  
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry  
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurry

Knowing that things ain't right  
Its in the papers, its on the TV,  
Its everywhere that I go  
Children are crying  
Soldiers are dying  
Some people don't have a home  
  
But I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Can you tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
  
I lose my appetite,  
Knowing kids starve tonight  
Am I a sinner,  
'Cause half my dinner is still there on my plate  
Ooh I got a vision, to make a difference  
And its starting today  
  
'Cause I know there's sunshine behind that rain  
I know there's good times behind that pain  
Heaven tell me how I can make a change  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and  
Pray for the broken-hearted  
I pray for the life not started  
I pray for all the lungs not breathing  
I pray for all the souls in need  
I pray  
Can you give 'em one today  
I just can't sleep tonight  
Can someone tell how to make a change?  
  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and pray  
I close my eyes and I can see a better day  
I close my eyes and I pray  
  
I pray  
I pray

Can talk to you, you're being rude, and there's no need to cry you departed

To let you know that I am a changed man  
Verse 2  
You tell your friends, that you don't know, what ima do next  
You're scared of me, no need to be, it's not like I'm your ex

Things seemed strange this morning  
As I packed my bags for school  
The smiles I'm used to seein' just weren't there  
I heard my father talking  
To my mother down the hallway  
Above the whispers all that I could hear... Was  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
I was feeling kinda helpless  
About the words that I just heard  
Could it be the family 2 doors down  
They said a couple months of bad luck  
Had them up against the wall  
And though it may seem small  
I know there's something I can do...  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
Make room at your table  
For your friends and family  
Take the time to share your day  
Just laugh talk and eat  
  
Chorus:  
Set a place at the table  
For someone who might need it  
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat  
Kick their shoes off  
Put their feet up  
Forget about their troubles for awhile  
When there's a place at your table  
There's little hope for you and I  
  
... There's a little hope for you and i

She don't like the fame, baby when we're miles apart  
And she getting to the point where it's too much for  
And throw us all away, it's too much for

I hope she waits a little bit longer  
'Cause I don't wanna live life, without her by my side  
'Cause she gets the light that is in me  
But she don't know, she don't know

She don't like the lights  
She don't, she don't, she don't

Someday at Christmas men won't be boys  
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys  
One warm December our hearts will see  
A world where men are free  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars  
When we have learned what Christmas is for  
When we have found what life's really worth  
There'll be peace on earth  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas we'll see a land  
No hungry children and no empty hand  
One happy morning people will share  
Our world where people care  
  
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears  
All men are equal and no men have fears  
One shining moment my heart ran away  
From our world today  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
  
Someday at Christmas man will not fail  
Take hope because your love will prevail  
Someday a new world that we can start  
With hope in every heart  
  
Someday all our dreams will come to be  
Someday in a world where men are free  
Maybe not in time for you and me  
But someday at Christmas time  
Someday at Christmas time

[Verse 1]  
You gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty,  
You know I try but I don't do too well with apologies.  
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?  
Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness.  
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice,  
By once or twice I mean maybe a couple a hundred times.  
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight,  
Cause I just need one more shot at second chances.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, yeah,  
Sorry.  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to,  
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two.  
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth,  
Can we both say the words and forget this?  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm not just trying to get you back on me (oh, no, no),  
Cause I'm missing more than just your body, your body!.  
Is it too late now to say sorry?  
Yeah I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, oh,  
Sorry.  
Yeah, I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?  
I'm sorry, yeah,  
Sorry, oh,  
Sorry.  
Yeah, I know that I let you down,  
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?

When the memmories and contant thoguhts wont go away.  
There's something about you that I can't let go  
But if we never meet there's nothing to show.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
You talk to everyone except me.  
How do you expect this thing to be?  
I don't want to say good-bye  
Because you've reailed me in so fast,  
Befor I was tought how.  
  
I go mornings and nights thinking about how it could have been,  
But the pain inside didn't want to give in. And somehow I the tears seem to
fade away.  
Thinking to myself maby one day...  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.  
I don't want to give this love up,  
But I can't forget the things you said.  
  
Nomater what happens to our love  
I'll always remember your touch,  
And the way you talk  
Ohh, the way you walk.  
  
So why did you leave me so speechless?  
I can't believe you let it get to your head.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nippin' at your nose (Yeah)  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight

They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and many goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly

And so, I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

Hey lonely lady with the big brown eyes,  
I'm making you're sadder than you realize  
I could make you smile and feel a little more related.  
We really click, would it be so wrong if we just dated?  
Let us goooo... Jump on my skateboard, eat some cake, along  
The lake  
I'll do all your favorite stuff right off the cuff cause we're  
Spontaneous.  
Let's hop a bus to shop, we'll check out Filene's, and  
Get chunky jewelry at Chico's.  
I'll buy you a panini, and some Spanks to make you teeny  
... You're the lady with the big brown eyes

[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I stayed by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
  
[Verse 1]  
I gave you attention when nobody else was paying  
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you saying?  
To keep you warm  
I showed you the game everybody else was playing  
That's for sure  
And I was on my knees when nobody else was praying  
Oh lord  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I stayed by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
Need you the most  
  
[Verse 2]  
I gave you my heart when you said yours was broken  
Yes I did  
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open  
Just admit it  
See I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping  
Can't deny it  
Now I'm all alone and my joys turn to moping  
Tell me...  
  
[Chorus]  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Where are you now?  
Where are you now that I need you?  
Couldn't find you anywhere  
When you broke down, I didn't leave you  
I was by your side  
So where are you now that I need you?  
I need you the most

Certain people don't like me no more  
New shit don't excite me no more  
Guess that they don't really make em like me no more  
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself  
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself  
But still, let them girls in and tell them all  
Leave their cell phones on the table where we see them  
I'm all day with it man, A. M to the P. M  
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
That's that ish that drives me crazy  
And that's all I've been getting lately  
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in

Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you

There's no need to run  
And now that I've made it

[Sean Kingston]  
I see them coming, yeah.  
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop.  
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.  
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.  
I, I see them coming, coming.  
They try to bring me down, but I won't stop.  
They want me in the ground, but I won't stop.  
'Til I'm dead, man, I won't stop. No.  
  
Yeah, I think they mad 'cause I'm driving in the fast lane  
But I've been grindin' for years, ask hype game  
It's funny how stuff doesn't change  
From sleepin' in the car to coppin' me that Range  
I'm all world star  
All them other blogs  
All them haters hatin' cause I am a heart throb  
But do I want it all?  
All the negativity is not gonna get rid of me  
I'm here to make history  
I'm speakin' it real  
Back track to the days when I ain't have me a deal, yeah  
So Imma show the world that I'm I'll  
Every beat that I get on best believe I'ma kill  
So you can have all the jewelry  
Have all the cars  
Have all the fame  
Have all the broads  
You can have the fact that I'm a star  
Just so you can listen to these bars  
  
[Justin Bieber]  
I see them coming. Yeah.

Yeah, they talk. Yeah, they talk.  
They don't walk the walk I walk.  
I won't stop, 'til I drop.  
Until then, I reach the top.  
Imma rock to where I need to be.  
  
Walk the path of destiny.  
Definitely been neglected, but God is always testin' me.  
Rest in peace to all the men that died that were protecting me. Objectively, I
need to tell you what just gets the best of me.  
Essentially, people in this world just wanna let it be.  
A lot of men ain't different though, just let it be.  
Set it free.  
Never be scared to make change, effectively.  
Always look at things from different ways, perspectively.  
Every person in this world can do good.  
I just want this message understood.  
Alright... Stop.  
Everybody's gotta listen make the decision to envision a better place with no
division.  
Religion.  
Everybody needs a mission. Haters need to stop it, just listen.

What day is it? And in what month?  
This clock never seemed so alive  
I can't keep up and I can't back down  
I've been losing so much time  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
  
All of the things that I want to say just aren't coming out right  
I'm tripping on words  
You've got my head spinning  
I don't know where to go from here  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
  
There's something about you now  
I can't quite figure out  
Everything she does is beautiful  
Everything she does is right  
  
Cause it's you and me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to lose  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you  
And me and all of the people with nothing to do  
Nothing to prove  
And it's you and me and all of the people  
And I don't know why, I can't keep my eyes off of you

You've got the mother load.  
You've got the stuff I like.  
Everytime I'm with you babe,  
I just get psyched.  
Like bling in your mouth but it's just old fillings.  
Dry skin on your hands, and your so cracked,  
Like (this part is mumbled in the video),  
Sittin on ur bed with your jacked up back.  
Hey girl, I want to watch you do you pilates, and skip  
The hard part.  
Cuz baby, you've got the mother load.
