All the walls are falling down  
As all the nations praaise  
And all the world will hear this shout  
Can you hear the sound of faith?

Lord I thank you  
For your love  
For this grace divine  
Love and mercy  
Undeserving

To every outcast  
A friend and comforter

Did you feel the mountains tremble?  
Did you hear the oceans roar?  
When the people rose to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the risen one  
  
Did you feel the people tremble?  
Did you hear the singers roar?  
When the lost began to sing of  
Jesus Christ, the saving one  
  
And we can see that God, You're moving  
A mighty river through the nations  
And young and old will turn to Jesus  
Fling wide Your heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord  
  
Open up the doors and let the music play  
Let the streets resound with singing  
Songs that bring Your hope  
Songs that bring Your joy  
Dancers who dance upon injustice  
  
Did you feel the darkness tremble  
When all the saints join in one song  
And all the streams flow as one river  
To wash away our brokeness  
  
And here we see that God, You're moving  
A time of Jubilee is coming  
When young and old return to Jesus  
Fling wide your Heavenly gates  
Prepare the way of the risen Lord

Here I am waiting, abide in me, I pray  
Here I am longing for You  
Hide me in Your love, bring me to my knees  
May I know Jesus more and more  
  
Come live in me all my life, take over  
Come breathe in me, I will rise on eagle's wings  
Come live in me all my life, take over  
Come breathe in me, I will rise on eagle's wings  
  
Here I am waiting, abide in me, I pray

That God can make miracles happen today  
Would you believe me if I said  
That you don't need to wait for the answer before  
You step out in faith  
Would you believe me if I said  
That nothin' is ever impossible for God  
  
Just live you life with God inside  
You won our regret one moment of it  
And give all that you can for God. for God

Was born on Christmas Day  
To save us all from Satan's power  
When we were gone astray  
  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
Comfort and joy  
Oh tidings of comfort and joy  
  
From God our heav'nly Father  
A blessed angel came  
And unto certain shepherds  
Brought tidings of the same  
How that in Bethlehem was born  
The son of God by name  
  
Now, to the Lord sing praises  
All ye within this place  
And with true love and brotherhood  
Each other now embrace  
This holy tide of Christmas  
All others doth deface

Verse  
The light of the world  
Shining in love  
Taking the fall upon Your shoulders  
You shattered the dark  
As You rose to life again  
  
You search all the earth  
For those who are lost  
And leaving the rescued for the fallen  
You're leading us home  
As we call upon Your Name  
  
Chorus  
You're the God who saves  
You're the hope of all  
Reaching out Your hand  
As Your people call  
  
Verse  
Our Saviour has come  
Let Your will be done  
Your kingdom on earth as in the heavens  
Our freedom is found  
Lord in no other name  
  
You are the Way  
The Truth and the Life  
Your mercy has overcome our failings  
The battle is won  
Jesus in love You reign  
  
Bridge  
Here in Your light ever brighter  
We lift Your Name higher and higher

You lay aside Your throne  
And to this world  
You have come  
  
You offered up Your life  
The debt You paid  
Was not Yours  
  
Your grace abounds to me  
Your grace abounds to me  
Jesus  
In You I find all that I need  
  
A gift I could not earn  
Your open arms  
Are undeserved  
  
Enabled by Your grace  
Now to live  
Is Christ alone  
  
All powerful  
All glorious  
There's nothing like the Name of Jesus  
  
All powerful  
All glorious  
There's nothing like Your Name

Saved by Your mercy,  
Found in Your grace,  
Totally surrendered to Your embrace,  
And there's nothing more than You.  
  
See Your perfection,  
I'm lost in Your peace.  
Your faithfulness sings over me,  
And Your love is the light of my soul.  
  
And I lift my eyes to You,  
Creator of the world.  
  
And I stand in awe of You,  
Of Your glory,  
And I live to worship You,  
Son of God, King of heaven.  
  
And the angels round Your throne,  
Cry out holy,  
To the One who is to come,  
Hear us sing hallelujah.  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah, hallelujah.

Oh blessed Lamb once slain  
Will reign for evermore  
His hands once bound now save  
Our God will never fail  
  
He is Lord  
He is Lord  
Sings my soul  
He is the Lord  
And He lives  
Yes He lives  
I?m alive  
Cause Jesus lives  
  
'Tis at the cross of Christ  
Where earth and heaven meet  
Where sin is overcome  
To God the victory  
  
And now  
Let the earth resound with praise  
For our Saviour God He reigns  
He is high and lifted up  
Arise  
For the King of glory waits  
He is coming back again  
He is coming back again

Call upon the name of the Lord  
And be saved

have never walked on water  
Felt the waves beneath my feet  
But at Your word Lord  
I'll receive Your faith to walk on oceans deep  
  
And I remember how You found me  
In that very same place  
All my failings surely would have drowned me  
Still You made a way  
  
[Chorus]  
You are my freedom  
Jesus You're the reason  
I'm knelling again at your throne  
Where would I be without You  
Here in my life  
Here in my life  
  
You have said that all the heavens  
Sing for joy at one who finds the  
Way to freedom truth of Jesus  
Brought from death into this life  
  
And I remember how You saw me  
Through the eyes of Your grace  
And though the price was Your beloved for me  
Still You made a way

In Your courts, You'll find me  
In worship at Your feet

In the shadow of Your wings  
Where I will be  
Where I will be  
  
Your love is all I need  
So desperately I have sought Your face  
I know You hear my every cry  
And petition that I make  
  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure

Down on my knees again  
Surrendering all

Find me here

Drench my soul

I hunger and thirst

With arms stretched wide  
I know you hear my cry  
Speak to me now  
Speak to me now

I belong to You  
I will bless You while I live  
And I will lift my hands up in Your name  
  
Jesus, You alone are holy  
You alone are holy  
Name above every name  
Lord Jesus, You alone are worthy  
You alone are worthy  
Jesus, the Lamb that was slain  
  
Nailed to the cross for me  
Died and rose again  
You redeemed me to the Father by Your blood  
You cleansed me from all sin

Your eye is on the sparrow  
And Your hand, it comforts me  
From the ends of the Earth to the depth of my heart  
Let Your mercy and strength be seen  
  
You call me to Your purpose  
As angels understand  
For Your glory, may You draw all men  
As Your love and grace demand  
  
And I will run to You to Your words of truth  
Not by might, not by power but by the spirit of God  
Yes I will run the race till I see Your face  
Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace

You gave me courage to believe  
That all Your Goodness I could see  
Cause if it had not been for You  
Standing on my side  
Where would I be  
  
Chorus:  
If not for Your Goodness  
If not for Your Grace  
I don't know where I would be today  
If not for Your Kindness  
I never could say, I'm still standing  
If not for Your Mercy  
If not for Your Love  
I most likely would have given up  
If not for Your Favor  
I never could say, I'm still standing  
But by the Grace of God  
  
To You I lift my offering  
And set my heart on higher things  
Cause if it had not been for You  
Standing on my side  
Where would I be  
  
On Christ, The Solid Rock I'll Stand  
All other ground is sinking sand  
On Christ, The Solid Rock I'll Stand  
But by the Grace of God  
  
I'm still standing, I'm still standing  
I'm still standing  
But by the Grace  
But by the Grace of God

In Your name  
There is hope when all seems lost  
There is freedom in the power of the cross  
Let the world see

Understanding that makes sense of our days

Verse  
You tore the night apart  
And ripped the silent skies in half

Yet place Yourself here into mine

Our great eternal hope arrives  
This great design drawn out for me  
  
Bridge  
In our silence

In our darkness  
Glory pierced the night  
  
We were broken  
But now we're lifted up  
King of heaven

Hallelujah  
Angels cried aloud  
Singing holy  
All the praise resound

I need you here... I need you here..  
You're like the rain that falls  
Fall on this heart and make me new  
  
I look to you... I look to you....  
You're king king above the earth...  
And you have put heaven in my heart...  
  
I only want to bwe where you are....  
  
Holy, holy is the Lord king of glory..  
Forever saviour of the world...  
  
Though mountains may be moved...  
And fall into the raging seas...  
You'll never let me fall....  
You hold me in your nail-scared hands

In the quiet, in the stillness  
I know that You are God  
In the secret of Your presence  
I know there I am restored  
When You call I won't refuse  
Each new day again I?ll choose  
There is no one else for me  
None but Jesus  
Crucified to set me free  
Now I live to bring Him praise  
In the chaos, in confusion  
I know you're sovereign still  
In the moment of my weakness  
You give me grace to do Your will  
So when You call I won't delay  
This my song through all my days  
There is no one else for me  
None but Jesus  
Crucified to set me free  
Now I live to bring Him praise  
All my delight is in You, Lord  
All of my hope, all of my strength  
All my delight is in You, Lord, forevermore  

Hold me in Your arms  
Never let me go  
I wanna spend eternity with You  
  
I stand before You, Lord  
And give You all my praise  
Your love is all I need  
Jesus, You're all I need  
  
My life belongs to You  
You gave Your life for me  
Your grace is all I need  
Jesus, You're all I need  
  
Hold me in Your arms  
Never let me go  
I wanna spend eternity with You  
  
And now that You're near  
Everything is different  
Everything's so different, Lord  
And I know I'm not the same  
My life You've changed  
And I wanna be with You  
I wanna be with You  
  
And I will sing for You always  
'Cause in Your presence God is where I wanna stay

O Holy Night  
Oh holy night! The stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Saviour's birth

Till He appeared and the soul felt it's worth  
A thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn.  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night divine.  
  
Truly He taught us to love one another  
His law is love and His gospel is peace  
Chains shall He break for the slave is our brother  
And in His name all oppression shall cease  
Sweet hymns of joy in grateful chorus raise we  
Let all within us praise His holy name  
  
Christ is the Lord! O praise His Name forever  
His power and glory evermore proclaim  
  
Fall on your knees! Oh, hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, Oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, Oh night, Oh night Divine
