I was waiting for so long  
For a miracle to come  
Everyone told me to be strong  
Hold on and don't shed a tear  
  
So through darkness and good times  
I knew I'd make it through  
And the world thought I had it all  
But I was waiting for you  
  
Hush now  
I see a light in the sky  
Oh it's almost blinding me  
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel  
With love  
  
Let the rain come down  
And wash away my tears  
Let it fill my soul  
And drown my fears  
Let it shatter the walls  
For a new sun  
A new day has come  
A new day has come  
  
Where it was dark now there's is light  
Where there was pain, now there's joy  
Where there was weakness, i found my strength  
All in the eyes of a boy  
  
Hush now  
I see a light in the sky  
Oh it's almost blinding me  
I can't believe I've been touched by an angel  
With love  
  
Let the rain come down  
And wash away my tears  
Let it fill my soul  
And drown my fears  
Let it shatter the walls  
For a new sun  
A new day has come  
A new day has come

I couldn't live  
I couldn't live without your love  
For one kiss  
Well I'd give everything up  
There's no words I can describe  
What I feel deep inside  
So I let this song say it all  
  
Then I hope you'll understand  
Once you've listened 'till the end  
  
Heard the music in my head  
So before I could forget  
  
I start singing  
Yeah I was singing  
This song  
For you  
  
Just made up the words  
La la la oh, oh, yeah  
My heart with a melody  
  
So I am singing  
This song  
For you

I've seen the tears and the heartache, and I felt the pain  
I've seen the hatred in so many lives, and lost in vain  
And yet through this darkness there's always a light that shines through  
And takes me back home  
Takes me back home  
  
All of the promises broken  
And all of the songs left unsung  
Seems so far away as I make my way back to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
You gave me faith and you gave me a world to believe in  
You gave me your love to believe in  
And feeling this love I can rise up above  
And be strong and be whole once again  
  
I know that dreams we hold on to, can just fade away  
And I know that words can be wasted, with so much to say  
And I when I feel helpless there's always a hope that shines through  
And makes me believe  
Makes me believe  
  
  
And I see for one fleeting moment  
A paradise under the sun  
I drift away and I make my way back to you  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Bridge:]  
Life goes on  
Can leave all sweet sorrow and pain  
And life, hold on  
To all that you are  
To all that we'll be  
And I can go on once again  
  
[Chorus:] x2  
  
Because your love hears my soul once again  
I can live and I can dream once again  
Because you made me love you

Christ the Lord

Used to be easy, used to have truth hangin' round  
Never had secrets, always singing your praises now good and loud  
All I got is questions, and you left me wondering why  
Why you keep your distance, every lonely night  
  
When love was bound together  
We lived it by the letter  
Can't close my eyes forever  
'Cause everything has changed and now  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
Its all about giving, its not about winning the game  
My mind was open, ready or not you closed it up again  
Still I keep asking, if you got something to hide  
I never stop learning, all the reasons why  
  
It took about a minute  
To find the point and hit it  
Gotta take this life and live it  
'Cause everything has changed and now  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
When all the lights go out so suddenly, I loose my way  
So baby tell me  
Is something going on  
You gotta free me, this time I'm gonna be strong  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
I ain't gonna look the other way, no more  
After all the clouds go by, its just another empty sky  
I ain't gonna wait to see the rain, no no  
Nothin's gonna make it right, look at me 'cause I choose life  
  
Gonna do it gonna make it alright  
Gonna do it gonna choose this life  
Nothing's gonna make it right  
Look at me 'cause I chose life (Oh baby)  
  
Nothing's gonna make it right  
Used to be easy, oh

Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but not am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers, toils, and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace that brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  
  
And when this flesh  
And heart shall fail  
And mortal life shall cease  
I shall possess  
Within the vale  
A life of joy and peace  
  
(coor)  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright, shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we first begun  
  
(Celine)  
Amazing Grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but not am found  
Was blind but now I see

So many 25th's of December  
Just as many 4th of July's  
And we're still holding it together  
It only comes down to you and I  
  
I know you can still remember  
Things we said right from the start  
When we said that this could be special  
I'm keeping those words deep down in my heart  
  
Another year has gone by  
And I'm still the one by your side  
After everything that's gone by  
There's still no one saying goodbye  
Though another year has gone by  
  
I never been much for occasions  
You never let another birthday go by  
Without announcing how much you love me  
But the truth was always there  
Right there in your eyes  
  
And we're still holding hands when we're walking  
Acting like we've only just met  
But how can that be - when there's so much history  
I guess that's how true lovers can get  
  
Another year has gone by  
And I'm still the one by your side  
After everything that's gone by  
There's still no one saying goodbye  
Though another year has gone by  
  
Another year has gone by  
And I'm still the one by your side  
After everything that's gone by  
There's still no one saying goodbye  
Though another year has gone by

  
Don't look away  
An innocent face  
Cries, and searches for some comfort  
Love will provide  
What fate has denied  
All they ask is simply someone  
  
With arms that reach  
And words that teach  
Will be their strength  
In times of need  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Aren't they all our children after all  
  
Who will be there  
To show them love and care  
They are this world's living treasure  
The heart of a child  
Is born to wear a smile  
And feel joyful without measure  
  
With arms that reach  
And words that teach  
Will be their strength  
In times of need  
We'll hold their hearts  
In loving hands  
Help them believe  
In love again  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Aren't we all their children after all  
  
And as they grow  
They will always know  
That love will ease their troubled road  
And you and I  
Are their wings  
To help them fly  
  
Every boy and girl  
Should dance on dreams  
Around this world  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Who will dry their tears  
And lift them up  
If they should fall  
Aren't they all our children after all  
Aren't they all our children after all  
  
Aren't they all our children after all

At last my love has come along  
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song  
Oh yeah yeah at last the skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped up in clover, the night I looked at you  
  
I found a dream, that I can speak to  
A dream that I, can call my own  
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
Oh yeah yeah, you smiled you smiled and then the spell was cast  
And here we are, in Heaven  
For you are mine at last  
  
I found a dream, that I could speak to  
A dream that I, can call my own  
I found a thrill, to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I have never known  
Oh yeah you smiled you smiled oh and then the spell was cast  
And here we are, in Heaven  
For you are mine at last at last, at last

sun is creeping down  
behind the hill  
everything is calm  
everything is still  
so baby close your eyes  
and rest your weary mind  
let me hold you close  
I'll sing you this lullaby  
let your worries go  
you fall asleep  
think of nothing more  
memories will keep  
your dreams will turn to gold  
and you will wake and find  
that you hold a smile all day  
from this lullaby  
maybe somewhere in the silence  
you may wake and you're all alone  
just call and I'll be there  
even when I'm gone  
each day will end  
so I'll say good night  
till we meet again  
now baby close your eyes  
and rest your weary mind  
II'll let you know the joy you bring  
every time you hear me sing  
you this lullaby

(David Foster, Junior Miles)

You're a beautiful boy  
With all your little toys  
Your eyes have seen the world  
Though you're only four years old  
And your tears are streaming  
Even when you're smiling  
Please never be afraid to cry  
  
You're a beautiful boy  
With all your little ploys  
Your mind has changed the world  
And you're now forty years old  
You got all you can carry  
And still feel somehow empty  
Don't ever be afraid to fly  
  
All you beautiful boys  
Creating multiple plays  
You like to fence in your world  
And settle down when you're old  
You can run from pole to pole  
And never scratch your soul  
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back  
Don't be afraid to go to hell and back  
Don't be afraid to be afraid  

(Alan Menken, Howard Ashman)  
  
Tale as old as time  
Truth as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Than somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
Just a little change  
Small, to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the Beast  
  
Ever just the same  
Ever a surprise  
Ever as before  
Ever just as sure  
As the sun will arise  
  
Tale as old as time  
Tune as old as song  
Bittersweet and strange  
Finding you can change  
Learning you were wrong  
  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as rhyme  
Beauty and the beast.

For all those times you stood by me  
For all the truth that you made me see  
For all the joy you brought to my life  
For all the wrong that you made right  
For every dream you made come true  
For all the love I found in you  
  
I'll be forever thankful baby  
You're the one who held me up  
Never let me fall, you're the one  
Who saw me through, through it all  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldn't speak  
You were my eyes when I couldn't see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  
You gave me faith 'cause you believed  
I'm everything I am  
Because you loved me  
  
You gave me wings and made me fly  
You touched my hand, I could touch the sky  
I lost my faith, you gave it back to me  
You said no star was out of reach  
You stood by me and I stood tall  
I had your love, I had it all  
  
I'm grateful for each day you gave me  
Maybe I don't know that much  
But I know this much is true  
I was blessed because I was loved by you  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldn't speak  
You were my eyes when I couldn't see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  
You gave me faith 'cause you believed  
I'm everything I am  
Because you loved me  
  
You were always there for me, the tender wind that carried me  
The light in the dark shining your love into my life  
You've been my inspiration, through the lies you were the truth  
My world is a better place because of you  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldn't speak  
You were my eyes when I couldn't see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  
You gave me faith 'cause you believed  
I'm everything I am  
Because you loved me  
  
You were my strength when I was weak  
You were my voice when I couldn't speak  
You were my eyes when I couldn't see  
You saw the best there was in me  
  
Lifted me up when I couldn't reach  
You gave me faith 'cause you believed  
I'm everything I am  
Because you loved me  
I'm everything I am  
Because you loved me

She's a fool and don't I know it  
But a fool can have her charms  
I'm in love and don't I show it  
Like a babe in arms  
  
Love's the same old situation  
Lately I've not slept a wink  
Since this crazy situation  
Has me on the blink  
  
I'm wild again, beguiled again  
A whimpering, simpering child again  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I  
  
Couldn't sleep, wouldn't sleep  
Love came and told me, shouldn't sleep  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I  
  
I lost my heart, but what of it  
She is cold I agree  
She might laugh, but I love it  
Although the laugh's on me  
  
I'll sing to her, bring spring to her  
And long, for the day when I'll cling to her  
Bewitched, bothered and bewildered, am I

I'll have a blue Christmas without you  
I'll be so blue thinking about you  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
  
Won't be the same if you're not here with me  
And when those blue snowflakes start fallin'  
And when those blue melodies start callin'  
You'll be doin' all right with your Christmas of white  
  
But I'll have a blue blue blue blue Christmas  
Decorations of red on a green Christmas tree  
Won't mean a thing, if you're not here with me  
  
I'll have a blue Christmas that's certain  
And when that blue heartache starts hurtin'  
You'll be doin' all right, with your Christmas of white,  
But I'll have a blue, blue Christmas

From the fire in your words  
To the dagger in your eye  
I just have to lay my body down  
Go and lay my body down  
I pretend to be asleep  
But I know you hear me cry  
I just have to lay my body down  
Go and lay my body down  
  
But if I  
Really want a change  
Then I must admit  
That I'm the one to blame  
  
If I could break away  
Cut the cord  
For worse or better  
If I could turn the page  
At last and say  
Goodbye forever  
But on the other side  
Of yesterday  
Beyond the heartache  
What if all I am  
Without the pain  
Is empty hearted  
I could break away  
  
Is it true what people say  
That it's darkest before dawn?  
I just have to lay my body down  
Go and lay my body down  
Any hope we might have saved  
Is too weak to let live on  
I just have to lay my body down  
Go and lay my body down  
  
And if I  
Really want a change  
Then tonight I'm gonna need  
All of my strength  
  
If I could break away  
Cut the cord  
For worse or better  
If I could turn the page  
At last and say  
Goodbye forever  
But on the other side  
Of yesterday  
Beyond the heartache  
What if all I am  
Without the pain  
Is empty hearted  
I could break away  
  
Oh, anything is better than this  
I know  
Anything is better  
  
If I could break away  
Cut the cord  
For worse or better  
If I could turn the page  
At last and say  
Goodbye forever  
But on the other side  
Of yesterday  
Beyond the heartache  
What if all I am  
Without the pain  
Is empty hearted  
  
If I could break away  
If I could turn the page  
But on the other side  
Of yesterday  
Beyond the heartache  
What if all I am  
Without the pain  
Is empty hearted  
I could break away

Close the door  
Shut the world away  
All the fight's gone from this wounded heart  
Across the floor  
Dreams and shadows play  
(Call) call the man  
Who deals in love beyond repair  
He can heal the world  
Oh hearts in need of care  
(Shine) shine a light ahead  
When the next step is unclear  
Call the man  
He's needed here  
I close my eyes  
I remember when  
Your sweet love filled this empty room  
The tears I cry  
Won't bring it back again  
Unless the lonely star should fall  
Needed in the chaos and confusion  
From the plains to City Hall  
Needed where the proud who walk the wire are set to fall  
Woah, call the man  
Who deals in once upon a time  
Maybe he  
Can mend this broken heart of mine  
Shine a light ahead  
Now the future isn't clear  
Isn't clear  
Call the man  
He's needed here  
Call the man  
He's needed here  
Oh yeah  
Ah, mmm  
He's needed here  
Right here  
He's needed here, right now, yeah  

A desert road from Vegas to nowhere  
Some place better than where you've been  
A coffee machine that needs some fixing  
In a little cafe just around the bend  
  
I am calling you  
Can't you hear me  
I am calling you  
  
A hot dry wind blows right through me  
The baby's crying and can't sleep  
But we both know a change in coming  
Coming close sweet release  
  
I am calling you  
I know you hear me  
I am calling you oh

I feel a little peculiar  
Feeling kinda strange  
I don't know what it is  
But I like the change  
That comes over me  
Whenever he's around  
It's as if my feet  
Don't even touch the ground  
  
Cause when I'm feeling down  
He's there to pick me up  
and when I talk too much  
He doesn't interrupt  
Let me tell you there's no better guy  
This is how it makes me feel inside  
  
I wanna dance (dance) mmm  
I wanna play (play)  
Well can you hear my heartbeat (boom boom)  
A million miles away  
He won't stop (stop) no no  
Till I drop (drop) yeah  
And every day and night he tells me  
I'm so special he could never give me up  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm hooked on a feeling  
A natural high  
You better believe it  
And the reason why  
It's a thing called love  
It makes me feel so alive  
And I can't fight the feeling  
  
Somebody told me once  
You only get one chance  
So live your life  
And do the best you can  
Once a day goes by  
You never get it back  
So live every minute  
Like it was your last  
  
Just dance (dance) mmm  
Come on play (play)  
And tell somebody you love them (I love you)  
At least once a day  
And don't stop (stop)  
Till you drop (drop)  
I didn't know that wanting someone so special  
Would come along to steal my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love, love, love  
And don't let it slip  
That was all you need  
If you taste it once  
It won't be enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can't fight the feeling  
I said, no, can't, can't, can't  
Can't fight the feeling  
Can't fight, oh!  
You better believe it  
You better believe it  
Can't fight the feeling

(Jean-Jacques Goldman)  
  
Y'a tant de murs qui te retiennent  
Trop d'inaccessibles? Chelles  
Dans tes are? Ves et dans tes mots  
  
Tu as choisi l'envers? La peine  
Ailleurs o? D'autres arcs-en-ciel  
Tracent des mondes plus beaux  
  
Cherche encore  
Tant que br? Lera ta flamme  
Le paradis qui dort  
Dans les secrets de ton? Me  
Cherche encore  
Suis ta lumi? Re et tes lois  
Si tu peux cherche encore plus fort  
Et si jamais tu te perds  
Je serai l?, je serai l?  
  
Je veux rester dans ton histoire  
Une petite porte ouverte  
Dans le couloir o? Tu fuis  
Derri? Re les barreaux de ta m? Moire  
M? Me o? La raison d? Serte  
Je t'entendrai sans un cri  
  
Va plus loin cherche encore  
Tant que br? Lera ta flamme  
Le paradis qui dort  
Dans les secrets de ton? Me  
Cherche encore  
Suis ta lumi? Re et ta foi  
Si tu peux cherche encore plus fort  
Et si jamais tu te perds  
Je serai l?, je serai l?  
  
Et le temps les gens continuent d'avancer  
Si tu tombes avant je saurai te porter  
Et les vents, les ans, continuent de tourner  
Si l'oubli t'attend, moi aussi je l'attendrai

Snow falling gently on the ground  
'Tis is the night before  
And in my heart there is no doubt  
That this is gonna be  
The brightest holiday  
'Cause here you are with me  
Baby, baby, I can't wait  
  
To spend this special time of year with someone who  
Makes me feel the special way that you do  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
We'll stay up late tonight  
Decorate the tree  
Just look into my eyes  
And I will tell you truthfully  
That I don't need no Santa Claus  
To hear my Christmas wish  
I got you in my arms  
And what could be a better gift  
Than to spend my very favorite time of year  
With the one I really love so near, Oh Yeah  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
And the bells are ringing when I hear you say  
We'll do it all again on Christmas Day  
I can't wait  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and they can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
Walkin' with you in a winter's snow  
Kissin' underneath the mistletoe  
People smiling everywhere we go  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love  
  
Ooh, you make the season bright  
With the lights reflecting in your eyes  
All my dreams are comin' true tonight  
It's Christmas Eve and I can see we're in love

I will always love you  
no matter what  
no matter where you go  
or what you do  
knowing you  
you gonna have to do things your own way  
and that's okay  
so be free  
spread your wings  
and promise me  
just one thing  
(chorus)  
if you ever need a place to cry  
baby come to me  
come to me  
I've always known that you were born to fly  
but you can come to me  
if the world breaks your heart  
no matter where on earth you are  
you can come to me  
don't walk around  
with the world on your shoulders  
and your highest hopes  
laying on the ground  
I know you think  
you've gotta try to be my hero  
but don't you know  
the stars you wish upon  
they fall that's true  
but I still believe in you  
(chorus)  
and those seven seas you sail  
or the winding road you roam  
leave you lost and feeling all alone  
let my heart be your beacon home  
(chorus)

Did you ever fall in love  
At the right time or place  
Does it always have to move  
At its own kinda pace  
  
When you're driving on cruise control  
Coming up a bumpy ride  
And your heart is back in shape  
Then it hits you with no chance to hide  
  
But don't you miss out on the way  
Don't find a reason to say  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
But I didn't do that  
(You gotta) Give it a shot  
Better believe  
And don't say you  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
(But I didn't do that)  
Just throw in everything you've got  
'Cause in love there's no holding back  
  
Tell me that you played it safe  
'Cause you're afraid to hurt your neck  
On the rollercoaster train,  
Never knowing what you get  
  
You think you want to be cynical,  
Want to date the best in me  
Giving up the greatest trash,  
Who knows what it turns out to be  
  
Don't you miss out on the way  
Don't find a reason to say  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
(But I didn't do that)  
(You gotta) give it a shot  
Better believe  
And don't say you  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
(But I didn't do that)  
Just throw in everything you've got  
Coz in love there's no holding back  
  
Ooohh  
It's meant to be,  
But don't think about it  
Let love run free,  
'Cause you're on your way  
  
Follow your heart where it's calling on you,  
Don't you say  
  
But I didn't do that,  
I didn't do that baby  
Gotta believe it  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
Oh!, but I didn't do that  
You gotta give it a shot  
Better believe  
And don't say you  
  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
But I didn't do that  
Just throw in everything you've got  
'Cause in love there's no holding back  
  
Didn't do that  
Coulda Woulda Shoulda  
Just throw in everything you've got  
'Cause in love there's no holding back

Back when I was a child  
Before life removed all the innocence  
My father would lift me high  
And dance with my mother and me  
And then spin me around 'til I fell asleep  
Then up the stairs he would carry me  
And I knew for sure I was loved  
If I could get another chance  
Another walk, another dance with him  
I'd play a song that would never ever end  
How I'd love, love, love  
To dance with my father again  
  
When I and my mother will disagree  
To get my way I would run from her to him  
He'd make me laugh just to comfort me, yeah, yeah  
Then finally make me do just what my mama says  
Later that night when I was asleep  
He left a dollar under my sheet  
Never dreamed that he would be gone from me  
If I could steal one final glance  
One final step, one final dance with him  
I'd play a song that will never, never end  
'Cause I'd love, I'd love to dance with my father again  
  
Sometimes I'd listen outside her door  
And I'd hear how my mama cried for him  
I pray for her even more than me  
I pray for her even more than me  
  
I know I'm praying for much too much  
But could you send back the only man she loved  
I know you don't do it usually  
But dear Lord, she's dying  
To dance with my father again  
Every night I fall asleep  
And this is all I ever dream

Come on, yeah  
  
You are my knight in armor  
The hero of my heart  
When you smile at me I see  
A true world go up  
The river is getting deep, believe it  
You're all these arms of mine wanna hold  
All wrapped up with a river  
Baby, I'm giving you this heart of gold  
  
So listen up, it's you I trust  
I feel magic every time that we touch  
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above  
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love  
(Hey of love)  
  
Just like Juliette belonged to Romeo  
You can stay prepared that I won't be letting you go  
In the heat of the night  
So right you taste my sweetness on your lips  
I'll make it better than you ever dreamed  
And the rest of your life will be just like this  
  
(Baby) So listen up, it's you I trust  
I feel magic every time that we touch  
(Baby) I pledge allegiance to the heavens above  
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love  
  
So listen up, it's you I trust  
I feel magic every time that we touch  
(Yeah) I pledge allegiance to the heavens above  
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love  
  
Declaration of love (love)  
Declaration of love (heh)  
Declaration of love (oh)  
Declaration of love (no no no no)  
Declaration of love (to you baby)  
Declaration of love (oh)  
  
In the heat of the night  
So right you taste my sweetness on your lips  
I'll make it better than you ever dreamed  
And the rest of your life will be just like this  
  
(Baby) So listen up, it's you I trust  
I feel magic every time that we touch baby, baby  
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above  
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love  
  
So listen up, it's you I trust  
I feel magic every time that we touch  
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above  
Tonight to you baby I make my declaration of love  
  
So listen up, it's you I trust  
Don't you know, don't you know  
I pledge allegiance to the heavens above  
I swear to you baby  
  
So listen up, it's you I trust  
(Ooh) I pledge allegiance to the heavens above

You say you still don't know the reason  
Why I walked away  
I know you thought you were so good to me  
I didn't see it that way  
My love's not something you can buy and sell  
Like pearls on a string  
And if you want to know where we went wrong  
You ought to stop and think  
  
Did you give enough love? Did you show that you cared?  
When I needed understanding were you really there?  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love?  
  
Good intentions you know I had  
Right from the start  
But if you wonder why we didn't last  
Just look inside your heart  
  
Did you give enough love? Did you show that you cared?  
When I needed understanding were you really there?  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love?  
  
Did you give enough time, when I was alone  
When I needed you there to make me feel I belonged  
You just don't know what you did to me  
I just had to be free  
  
Did ya, did ya, did ya give enough  
Did ya, did ya, did ya give enough  
  
Did you give enough love? Did you show that you cared?  
When I needed understanding were you really there?  
Whenever I was down did you try to pick me up?  
Maybe you should ask yourself  
Did you give enough love?  

I thought I had it long ago,  
I held on, but It let go.  
It kissed me on a subway train  
And I melted  
  
It got my hand it brushed my cheek,  
It moved right in, it cut me deep.  
You know it even had a name,  
I really felt it.  
  
I didn't know love,  
Not even close,  
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever known,  
It's making me weak,  
Making me strong,  
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up  
And find it gone,  
I didn't know love.  
  
It's a blessing, it's a curse.  
You know you've found it when it hurts.  
It can drive you off a cliff,  
But it's worth it.  
  
Careful where you spend the night,  
It's complicated when it's right.  
You can make me such a mess,  
Yeah you're perfect!  
  
But I didn't know love,  
Not even close,  
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever know,  
It's making me weak,  
Making me strong,  
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up  
And find you gone,  
I didn't know love.  
No, I didn't know love.  
  
Now you're lying in my arms, beside me.  
In the past I'd settled for a touch,  
I'd tell myself it was enough,  
I was lying, lying, lying.  
'Cause I didn't know love  
  
I didn't know love,  
Not even close,  
This is more beautiful and frightening than I've ever known.  
It's making me weak,  
Making me strong  
It's making me afraid I'm gonna wake up and find you gone.  
  
I didn't know love,  
No, I didn't know love,  
I didn't know love.  
I didn't know love.

Don't get so busy that you miss  
Giving just a little kiss  
To the ones you love  
Don't even wait a little while  
To give them a little smile  
A little is enough  
  
How many people are crying  
People are dying  
How many people are asking for love  
  
Don't save it all for Christmas Day  
Find a way  
To give a little love everyday  
Don't save it all for Christmas Day  
Find your way  
Cause holidays have come and gone  
But love lives on  
If you give on  
Love  
  
How could you wait another minute  
A hug is warmer when you're in it  
And Baby that's a fact  
And saying "I love you's" always better  
Seasons, reasons, they don't matter  
So don't hold back  
  
How many people in this world  
So needful in this world  
How many people are praying for love  
  
Don't save it all for Christmas Day  
Find a way  
To give a little love everyday  
Don't save it all for Christmas Day  
Find your way  
Cause holidays have come and gone  
But love lives on  
If you give on  
Love  
  
Let all the children know  
Everywhere that they go  
Their whole life long  
Let them know love  
  
Don't save it all for Christmas Day  
Find a way  
To give a little love everyday  
Don't save it all for Christmas Day  
Find your way  
Cause holidays have come and gone  
But love lives on  
If you give on  
Love  
Love

If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try

I learned from the past  
Not everything lasts  
I understand that now  
Everything changed  
When you walked away  
But I'll survive somehow  
Though I have regrets  
I'll learn to forget  
And just keep moving on  
'Cause when love is gone  
You have to be strong  
  
[Chorus]  
Once touched by pain  
You're not the same  
But time can heal  
Your heart again  
So let the clouds  
That bring you down  
Just fade away  
Away  
  
So I try to smile  
But after a while  
The memories come back  
But I won't give in  
'Cause I know that then  
My heart will fade to black  
  
And this time I learned  
That love can burn  
There's no right or wrong  
I've got to be strong  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know that one day I'll find that feeling again  
But until I do I'll do it fine by myself  
  
Once touched by pain  
You're not the same  
But time can heal  
Your heart again  
So let the clouds  
That bring you down  
You know that  
  
Once touched by pain  
You're not the same  
But time can heal  
Your heart again  
So let the clouds  
That bring you down  
So let the clouds  
That bring you down  
Just fade away  
Away

Don't be afraid to feel this way  
Gonna make you understand  
It's not about you, cause I am the fool  
Building castles in the sand  
  
If I am crazy, just don't care  
It doesn't mean I don't want you near,  
This is the story about me and you  
And it's called  
  
Faith!  
Right beside you is where I'll stay  
Oh Faith!  
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith!  
  
So many times and so many ways  
I didn't know just where to go,  
You gave me a sign and opened my eyes  
That's the reason why I know  
  
That you are different, you're still here  
I guess you figured me out right then  
Now I believe that we can make it through  
And that's called  
  
Faith!  
Right beside you is where I'll stay  
Oh Faith!  
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith! have faith!  
  
So don't be afraid, to feel this way  
Just hear me out!  
Stay  
  
And that's called,  
  
Faith!  
Right beside you is where I'll stay  
It's not too late  
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith, in me!  
  
Oh yeah!  
Just take me as I am, so please, have faith!

If I could  
I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes  
Give you courage in a world of compromise  
Yes, I would  
  
If I could  
I would teach you all the things I've never learned  
And I'd help you cross the bridges that I've burned  
Yes, I would  
  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine  
I've watched you grow  
So I could let you go  
  
If I could  
I would help you make it through the hungry years  
But I know that I can never cry your tears  
But I would  
If I could  
  
If I live  
In a time and place where you don't want to be  
You don't have to walk along this road with me  
My yesterday  
Won't have to be your way  
  
If I knew  
I'd have tried to change the world I brought to you to  
And there isn't very much that I can do  
But I would  
If I could...  
Oh baby... mummy wants to protect you  
And help my baby through the hungry years  
It's part of me  
And if you ever... ever need  
Sad shoulder to cry on  
I'm just someone to talk to  
I'll be there... I'll be there  
I didn't change your world  
But I would  
If I Could!

(S. Peiken, A. Roman)  
  
She can feel you  
Drifting far away  
But she can't see through  
What you do not say  
Take a step back  
Don't lose your ground  
Remember how you felt before  
And if you care about her  
Show her that you're sure  
  
If I were you  
My prized possessions  
Would be the ones I'd hold so close  
'Cause when you lose your love  
You lose what means the most  
If I were you  
I'd hold affection  
  
Higher than any star in sight  
Take this to heart  
And you'll never part  
These are the things that I would do  
If I were you  
  
Simple pleasures  
The hardest to be found  
Can't be measured  
'Till they're not around  
Maybe she'll go  
Maybe she'll stay  
But she'd rather go than fade away  
Sometimes the sweetest sorrow  
Is the saddest fate  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Take a step back  
Don't lose your ground  
Remember how you felt before  
And if you care about her  
Show her that you're sure  
  
If I were you  
I'd hold affection  
Higher than any star in sight  
Take this to heart  
And you'll never part  
These are the things that I would do  
If I were you  
Take this to heart  
You'll never part  
These are the things that I would do  
If I were you

You bought me flowers and you sold me a line  
You gave me compliments and too much wine  
I've played that game, I know all the moves  
  
You show emotion but you hide what you feel  
You play the innocent but I've watched you steal  
I rest my case, you stand accused  
  
But I must confess I was quite impressed  
You seduced me with your easy charm  
And I must admit I could fall for it  
  
But if love is out the question  
There's no point to this affection  
I gotta have more than ecstasy  
Make me believe  
I'm all you'll ever need  
'Cause if love is out the question  
Put a little heart in your intention  
I gotta have more than ecstasy  
Make me believe  
I'm all you'll ever need  
  
You talk in circles when I need a straight line  
You've got your principles and I've got mine  
We all need commitment that's all I ask  
(Is that a crime?)  
  
And I must confess I was quite impressed  
I was losing to your winning ways  
But I must resist there's no point to this  
  
But if love is out the question  
There's no point to this affection  
I gotta have more than ecstasy  
Make me believe  
I'm all you'll ever need  
  
'Cause if love is out the quesion I just gotta stop  
Little point to this affection I just want to stop  
It makes no sense to carry on like this  
If there's nothing between us you don't know  
what you'll miss  
  
No love  
There's no love  
Baby it's true  
There's no love  
  
But if love is out the question  
There's no point to this affection  
'Cause if love is out the question  
Put a little heart in your intention

(Walter Afanasieff, John Bettis)  
  
Here they come  
Every night the same  
Silent stars  
Light from a distant flame  
Just like the memories of you  
That I hold inside  
I see you touch  
But all the warmth has died  
  
Empty rooms  
Crowded by the past  
Time is my enemy  
Days keep moving faster  
But the nights alone can be  
An eternity  
That never heals the scars  
Of foolish pride  
  
If only you could see me now  
Goodbye is not so easy now  
The freedom that I walked away to gain  
Is nothing but these chains  
That you alone can break  
And you would free me now  
Your heart would come undone  
Just looking at me once  
And my love would bring you back  
If only you could see me now  
  
Here I am  
Stranger to a smile  
Trying to fight the tears  
Missing by a mile  
I'm not the one who laughed at you  
On that yesterday  
When you warned me not to throw your love away  
  
If you could only see me now  
Goodbye is not so easy now  
The freedom that I walked away to gain  
Is nothing but these chains  
I know your heart would break  
If you could hear me now  
Your heart would come undone  
If you could hear me once  
Hoping love will bring you back  
If only you could see me now  
  
[Bridge:]  
  
Like the lonely moon  
You see above  
That sails the dark alone  
Forever  
I have no light of my own  
Other the love we've known  
So long ago  
Together  
  
If you could feel me now  
Your heart would come undone  
If you could touch me once  
I know love will bring you back  
If only you could see me now

I never found out why you walked away  
And never said good-bye  
But now that I see you  
I'm torn inside, but I've still got my pride  
  
I understand that some things are better left unsaid  
I'm afraid of the truth  
But what can I do if I still want you  
  
If we could start over again  
I know if we try our love could be stronger  
If we could start over again  
I'm sure, we oh  
We'd never have to let go  
  
For so many years now  
I've held inside things I meant to say  
But faced with the past now I realize  
I can't let that stand in our way  
  
I never knew that a love so strong would never fade  
But what can we do  
If I still want you  
And you want me too  
  
How can we walk away  
From something that was once so strong  
Have we the strength to say we're wrong

Used to be that I believed in something  
Used to be that I believed in love  
It's been a long time since I've had that feeling  
I could love someone  
I could trust someone  
I said I'd never let nobody near my heart again, darlin'  
I said I'd never let nobody in  
  
But if you asked me to  
I just might change my mind  
And let you in my life, forever  
If you asked me to  
I just might give my heart  
And stay here in your arms forever  
If you asked me to  
If you asked me to  
  
Somehow ever since I've been around you  
Can't go back to being on my own  
Can't help feeling, darlin', since I've found you  
That I've found my home  
That I'm finally home  
I said I'd never let nobody get too close to me, darlin'  
I said I needed, needed to be free  
  
(But if you asked me to)  
  
Ask me to, I will give my world to you baby  
I need you now  
Ask me to, I'll do anything for you baby  
For you baby  
  
If you asked me to  
I'd let you in my life forever  
If you asked me to

Do you realize how long it's been  
Where does all my time with you go?  
And all the memories  
We shared as friends  
Reflected, in my heart  
Is where they show  
  
I'm loving every moment with you  
I'm living in a dream that's comin' true  
I'm lost in everything you do  
I love you  
I'm saving every moment for you  
You're hidden in a place that's safe and true  
Lovin' everything we do  
  
With every second  
You hold me near  
I'm closer to a place I want to be  
To hear you whisper  
But no one else can hear  
I want your love  
To stay forever, inside of me  
  
In our silence  
Looking in your eyes  
I hear words you don't need to say  
Just hold on Baby  
'Cause it's reason, I'm prayin'  
You feel what I feel  
In every way

Whole world is watching us now  
It's a little intimidating  
But since there's no way to calm down  
Let's give them some amazing  
  
Let's make them remember  
Using one word  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Let's make them remember  
We were incredible  
Simply incredible  
  
We even counted us all  
We were real sure we'd make it  
But, we learned no matter what they dish out  
It's nothing we can take it  
  
We'll go down in history  
They'll describe our love as  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Let's make them remember  
We were incredible  
Simply incredible  
  
Everybody say oh  
Say oh  
Say no  
Say oh  
  
Let's make them remember  
They'll describe our love as  
Incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Oh, incredible (oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Let's make them remember  
We were incredible  
Simply incredible  
  
Simply incredible  
  
Let's give them some amazing  
Let's give them some amazing

There were nights when the wind was so cold  
That my body froze in bed  
If I just listened to it  
Right outside the window  
  
There were days when the sun was so cruel  
That all the tears turned to dust  
And I just knew my eyes were  
Drying up forever  
  
I finished crying in the instant that you left  
And I can't remember where or when or how  
And I banished every memory you and I had ever made  
  
But when you touch me like this  
And you hold me like that  
I just have to admit  
That it's all coming back to me  
When I touch you like this  
And I hold you like that  
It's so hard to believe but  
It's all coming back to me  
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  
  
There were moments of gold  
And there were flashes of light  
There were things I'd never do again  
But then they'd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than any laws allow  
Baby baby  
  
If I kiss you like this  
And if you whisper like that  
It was lost long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
If you want me like this  
And if you need me like that  
It was dead long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
It's so hard to resist  
And it's all coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But it's all coming back to me now  
But it's all coming back  
  
There were those empty threats and hollow lies  
And whenever you tried to hurt me  
I just hurt you even worse  
And so much deeper  
  
There were hours that just went on for days  
When alone at last we'd count up all the chances  
That were lost to us forever  
  
But you were history with the slamming of the door  
And I made myself so strong again somehow  
And I never wasted any of my time on you since then  
  
But if I touch you like this  
And if you kiss me like that  
It was so long ago  
But it's all coming back to me  
If you touch me like this  
And if I kiss you like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  
(It's all coming back, it's all coming back to me now)  
  
There were moments of gold  
And there were flashes of light  
There were things we'd never do again  
But then they'd always seemed right  
There were nights of endless pleasure  
It was more than all your laws allow  
Baby, baby, baby  
  
When you touch me like this  
And when you hold me like that  
It was gone with the wind  
But it's all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
Then we see what we want to see  
All coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall  
But it's all coming back to me now  
  
If you forgive me all this  
If I forgive you all that  
We forgive and forget  
And it's all coming back to me  
When you see me like this  
And when I see you like that  
We see just what we want to see  
Al coming back to me  
The flesh and the fantasies  
All coming back to me  
I can barely recall but it's all coming back to me now  
  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And when you kiss me like this  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And when I touch you like that  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
If you do it like this  
(It's all coming back to me now)  
And if we

There's something in your eyes that's far too revealing  
Why must it be like this a love without feelin'  
Something is wrong with you I know  
I see it in your eyes  
Believe me when I say  
It's gonna be Okay  
  
I told you from the start I won't be demanding  
I won't be demanding  
If you have a change of heart I'll be understanding  
I'll be understanding  
When love becomes a broken heart and dreams begin to die  
Believe me when I say  
We'll work it out some way  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
We've lost that loving touch we used to feel so much  
I try to hide the truth that's in my eyes  
The love without feeling  
But when I feel we're not in love, I know I'm losing you  
Believe when I say  
We'll work it out some way  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
Don't say goodbye  
  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try  
Believe me when I say  
It's hard to say goodbye  
  
I'll never try to hold you back  
I wouldn't try controlling you  
If it's what you want  
It's what I want  
I want what's best for you  
And if there's something else that you're looking for  
I'll be the first to help you try

I've got the world on a string  
I'm sittin' on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world, what a life, I'm in love  
  
I've got a song that I sing  
I can make the rain go  
Any time I move my finger  
Look at me, can't you see, I'm in love?  
  
Life is a beautiful thing  
As long as I hold the string  
I'd be a silly so-and-so  
If I should ever let you go  
  
I've got the world on a string  
I'm sittin' on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world, what a life, I'm in love  
  
Life is a beautiful thing  
As long as I hold the string  
I'd be a silly so-and-so  
If I should ever let you go, yes  
  
I've got the world on a string  
I'm sittin' on a rainbow  
Got a string around my finger  
What a world,  
And this is the life, hey now  
I'm so in love!

Douceur d'un ciel d'Amerique  
Reveur comme une musique  
J'oublies deja que tu es tout en pleurs  
C'est deja novembre sans toi  
Je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi  
Non je ne le veux pas  
Je ne veux pas que tu sois bien  
Quand je suis loin de tes bras  
  
Promesses dans le vent  
Poesies sans rimes  
Fumee sans flames  
C'est deja novembre  
  
Frissons des yeux d'aquarelle  
Passion de polichinelle  
Tout ce bonheur que je croyais prendre  
C'est deja novembre sans toi  
  
Je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi  
Non je ne le veux pas  
Je ne veux pas que tu sois bien  
Quand je suis loin de tes bras  
  
Je ne veux pas que tu sois bien  
Quand je suis loin de tes bras  
  
Nous deux c'etait Babel  
Comment se comprendre  
Tu parlais trop  
Et c'est deja novembre  
  
Je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi  
Non je ne le veux pas  
Je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi  
Non je ne le veux pas  
  
Je ne veux pas que tu sois bien  
Quand je suis loin de tes bras  
  
Nous deux c'etait Babel (et)  
Comment se comprendre  
Tu parlais trop  
Et c'est deja novembre  
  
Mmmm je ne veux pas  
Mmmm je ne veux pas  
Je ne veux pas  
  
Je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi  
Non je ne le veux pas  
Je ne veux pas que tu te moques de moi  
Non je ne le veux pas  
  
Je ne veux pas  
Je ne veux pas  
Je ne veux pas

I know I never loved this way before  
And no one else has loved me more  
With you I've laughed and cried  
I have lived and died  
What I wouldn't do just to be with you  
  
I know I must forget you to go on  
I can't hold back my tears too long  
Though life won't be the same  
I've got to take away  
And find the strength I need to let you go  
  
Just walk away  
Just say goodbye  
Don't turn around now you may see me cry  
I mustn't fall apart  
Or show my broken heart  
Or the love I feel for you  
  
So walk away  
And close the door  
And let my life be as it was before  
And I'll never never know  
Just how I let you go  
But there's nothing left to say  
Just walk away  
  
There'll never be a moment I'll regret  
I've loved you since the day we met  
For all the love you gave  
And all the love we made  
I know I've got to find the strength to say  
  
Just walk away  
Just say goodbye  
Don't turn around now you may see me cry  
I mustn't fall apart  
Or show my broken heart  
Or the love I feel for you  
  
So walk away  
And close the door  
And let my life be as it was before  
And I'll never never know  
Just how I let you go  
But there's nothing left to say  
Just walk away

Si j'ecrivais le livre de ma vie  
Je parlerais de mon amie Madeleine  
Que j'ai vu rire et pleurer a la fois  
Un matin en sortant de chez moi  
  
If I was writting the book of my life  
I would talk about my friend Madeleine  
Who I saw laughing and crying at the same time  
One morning going ouf of my home  
Ce qu'elle a dit  
Je ne l'oublierai pas  
(Que Dieu benisse ta maison)  
M'a dit Madeleine  
  
What she told me  
I will never forget  
"God blesses your house"  
Told me Madeleine  
Et moi j'ai compris la chance  
Que le ciel m'avait donne  
De naitre ou les caresses sentent bon  
Si je dois courir le monde  
Mes pas me rameneront  
Toujours sur les chemins de ma maison  
  
And I understood the chance  
The sky has given me  
To born where caresses smell good  
If I have to run over the world  
My steps will take me back  
Always on the paths of my house  
See'est la que j'ai grandi  
La que l'on m'a aime  
La que j'ai couru  
La que j'ai chante  
L'odeur do feu de bois  
La chaleur do bon pain  
Mon dieu mon dieu  
  
It's there that I've grown up  
There that I have been loved  
There I ran  
There I sang  
The smell of the wood fire  
The warmth of the good bread  
My god my god  
Si j'ecrivais le livre de ma vie  
Il s'ouvrirait avec le coeur  
De ceux qui m'aiment  
Tous ceux qui aussi veulent faire  
En se levant chaque jour  
Un monde ou les caresses sentent bon  
Ceux qui sont dans mes prieres  
Et tous ceux qui m'attendront  
Toujours sur les chemins de ma maison  
  
If I was writting the book of my life  
It would open with the heart  
Of those who love me  
All those who also want to do  
Waking every morning  
A world where caresses smell good  
Those who are in my prayers  
And all those who will wait me  
Always on the paths of my house  
Sur les chemins de ma maison  
Sur les chemins de ma maison  
  
On the paths of my house  
On the paths of my house

Quand marcher sans autre but  
Plus de pas demain fourbu  
Dans le n'ant du froid de la rue  
  
Quand les mots n'existent plus  
Quand l'esp?rance oubli?e, dissolue  
Quand les alcools m?me ne sao?lent plus  
Restent les phrases ?corch?es  
De ces phrases qu'on jette avant de renoncer  
  
Les derniers seront les premiers  
Dans l'autre r'alit  
Nous serons princes d'?ternit?  
  
Un billet sur le trottoir  
Dans un journal d'autres histoires  
Un rayon de soleil au hasard  
  
Une fleur abandonne  
Ce que les autres ont laisse de c'ete  
Plus assez neuf, plus assez  
Quand ta place est au-dehors  
Ne reste que ces phrases comme l'autre soir  
  
Les derniers seront les premiers  
Dans l'autre r'alit  
Nous serons princes d'eternite

A million stars' light  
This beautiful night  
This is not a night to die  
Let me sing and dance beneath the sky  
I have such love to give...to give  
I want a chance to live  
  
Live, for the one I love  
Love, as no one has loved  
Give, asking nothing in return  
  
Free, free to find my way  
Free to have my say  
Free to see the day  
Be like I used to be  
Like I'm wild bird free  
With all of life in me  
  
Live, for the one I love  
Love, as no one has loved  
Give, asking nothing in return  
  
Though this world tears us apart  
We're still together in my heart  
I want the world to hear my cry  
And even if I have to die  
Love will not die  
Love will change the world  
  
Live, for the one I love  
Love, like no one has loved  
Give, asking nothing in return  
  
I'll love until love wears me away  
I'll die and I know my love will stay  
And I know my love will stay

Tu dis qu' je suis trop jeune  
Pour vivre avec un homme  
Moi je te dis  
Je m'en fous, je m'en fous  
I love you  
  
Si tu ne veux pas prendre  
L'amour que je te donne  
Je pourrais te rendre fou, rendre fou  
Jusqu'au bout  
  
Lolita n'est pas trop jeune pour aimer  
N'est pas trop jeune pour se donner  
Quand le desir d?vore son corps  
Jusqu'au bout de ses doigts  
Jamais trop jeune pour aimer  
Jamais trop jeune pour se donner  
Mais tu ignores le feu qui dort  
Au fond de moi  
  
Toutes ces nuits que j'ai pass?es  
Seule ? te caresser  
Il faut que tu me les rendes, me les rendes  
Une ? une  
  
Toutes ces nuits toute seule dans le noir  
De ma chambre  
? r?ver que tu viens me prendre  
Me feras-tu encore attendre des jours, des mois  
  
Si tu ne viens pas, ce s'ra un autre  
Si ce n'est pas toi, ce s'ra ta faute  
Si je regrette toute ma vie  
Ma premi?re nuit d'amour  
  
Trop jeune pour aimer  
Qu'est-ce que ?a veut dire  
Lolita r?pond je m'en fous, je m'en fous  
I love you

Tu this qu je suis trop jeune  
  
Pour vivre avec un homme  
  
Moi je te this  
  
Je men fous, je men fous  
  
I love you  
  
You say that I'm too young  
  
To live with a man  
  
And I'm telling you  
  
I don't give a damn, don't give a damn  
  
I love you  
  
Si tu ne veux pas prendre  
  
Lamour que je te donne  
  
Je pourrais te rendre fou, rendre fou  
  
Jusquau bout  
  
If you don't want to take  
  
The love I'm giving you  
  
I could make you crazy, make you crazy  
  
Until the end  
  
Lolita nest pas trop jeune pour aimer  
  
Nest pas trop jeune pour se donner  
  
Quand le desir dvore son corps  
  
Jusquau bout de ses doigts  
  
Jamais trop jeune pour aimer  
  
Jamais trop jeune pour se donner  
  
Mais tu ignores le feu qui dort  
  
Au fond de moi  
  
Lolita is not too young to love  
  
Is not too young to give herself  
  
When desire consumes her (lit.: devours her body)  
  
Completely (lit.: to the ends of her fingers)  
  
Never too young to love  
  
Never too young to give herself  
  
But you don't know the fire which lies dormant  
  
Inside of me  
  
Toutes ces nuits que jai passes  
  
Seulete caresser  
  
Il faut que tu me les rendes, me les rendes  
  
Uneune  
  
Toutes ces nuits toute seule dans le noir de ma chambre  
  
Rever que tu viens me prendre  
  
Me feras-tu encore attendre des jours, des mois  
  
Si tu ne viens pas, ce sra un autre  
  
Si ce nest pas toi, ce sra ta faute  
  
Si je regrette toute ma vie  
  
Ma premire nuit damour  
  
All those nights I spent  
  
Alone caressing you  
  
You have to give them back to me, back to me  
  
One by one  
  
All those nights all alone in the darkness of my room  
  
Dreaming that you would come to take me (" take me" in the sense of " make
love to me")  
  
Will you again make me wait for days, months  
  
If its not you, it will be another guy  
  
If its not you, it will be your fault  
  
If I am sorry my whole life  
  
About my first night of love  
  
Trop jeune pour aimer  
  
Quest-ce que ca veut dire  
  
Lolita rpond je men fous, je men fous  
  
I love you  
  
Too young to love  
  
What does that mean  
  
Lolita answers, I don't give a damn, give a damn  
  
I love you  
  
Je men fous  
  
I love you  
  
I don't give a dawn  
  
I love you

Somewhere past midnight  
When the moment is just right  
We ride the streets of desire  
We take it slow and  
Always get where we're goin'  
'Cause where there's smoke there's a fire  
  
There's no denying  
We don't need to keep trying  
Let's face the music and dance  
  
Well it's all semantic  
What we never say  
But what we feel ain't goin' away  
  
So I wonder, how could we be feeling  
More than this  
Tell me true  
What it is, 'cause  
  
Something has to make us feel this way  
Love by another name  
Doesn't matter 'cause it's still the same love  
Won't depend upon the words we say  
Love by another name  
Something happens when we're making love  
  
Si ce n'est pas l'amour  
Qu'est-ce que c'est?  
  
We're superstitious  
When every day is like Christmas  
No promise spoken  
Hearts don't have to get broken  
More than a four letter word  
  
If we're just pretending  
We can write a new ending  
If we don't like where it leads  
  
Well it's new romantic  
Action over words  
The sweetest nothings that I've heard  
  
I can't tell you everything I'm feeling  
More than this  
Do you know  
What it is, 'cause  
  
I know that I can't describe  
What I'm feeling inside  
Maybe I'll learn  
I guess I live with the fear  
This could all disappear  
If I try to put it in words

There ain't a dream that don't have a chance  
To come true now  
It just takes a little faith baby  
Anything that we want to do  
We can do now  
There ain't nothing in our way baby  
Nothing our love couldn't rise above  
We can get through the night  
We can get to the light  
Long as we got our love to light the way  
  
With a little faith  
Just a little trust  
If you believe in love  
Love can move mountains  
Believe in your heart  
And feel, feel it in your soul  
And love baby love can love can move mountains  
  
Oceans deep and mountains high  
They can't stop us  
Because love is on our side baby  
We can reach the heavens and touch the sky  
Just believe it, believe in you and I baby  
If we got love that is strong enough  
We can do anything, make it through anything  
'Cause through it all love will always find a way  
  
With a little faith...  
  
You believe in me  
I'll believe in you  
If we believe in each other  
Nothing we can't do  
If we got love that is strong enough  
Love will find a way  
  
With a little faith?

[Chorus]  
Love doesn't ask why  
It speaks from the heart  
And never explains  
Don't you know that  
Love doesn't think twice  
It can come all at once  
Or whisper from a distance  
  
Don't ask me if this feeling's right or wrong  
It doesn't have to make much sense  
It just has to be this strong  
'Cause when you're in my arms I understand  
We don't try to have a voice  
When our hearts make the choices  
There's no plan  
It's in our hands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I can feel what you're afraid to say  
If you give your soul to me  
Will you give too much away  
We can't let this moment pass us by  
Can't question this chance  
Or expect any answers  
We can try  
But love doesn't ask you why  
  
So let's take what we found  
And wrap it around us  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love doesn't ask why

She was living in a perfect house  
With pictures of smiling faces  
But there's a different story told inside  
Underneath it all  
With the sunglasses and makeup on  
Blaming the stairs at Macy's  
They all knew  
(No one even asked, is a something wrong?)  
So they wait  
Now she's gone  
  
I don't understand the concept of  
The power of one is stronger  
Why don't people seem to care at all  
As long as it's not about them  
I say  
I guess we've underestimated love  
Or why would we hurt each other  
Don't you find that ironical  
When love is all we need  
Oh yeah  
  
He is living down his sunset strip  
Singing the blues for money  
It's easy just to look the other way  
When you have it all  
He's reaching out to find a helping hand  
But nobody seems to bother  
Hear them say  
(It's not my problem so it's not my call)  
You're on your own  
Through it all  
  
Chorus  
  
When it all becomes too real  
We have a tendency to be  
Too scared to face it  
It's breaking my heart to see  
When love is all we need  
  
Chorus

Waking up alone  
In a room that still reminds me  
My heart has got to learn to forget  
Starting on my own  
With every breath I'm getting stronger  
This is not the time for regret  
Cause I don't need to hang on to heartbreak  
When there's so much of life left to live  
  
Love is on the way  
On wings of angels  
I know its true, I feel it coming through  
Love is on the way  
Time is turning the pages  
I don't know when  
But love will find me again  
  
I am not afraid  
Of the mystery of tomorrow  
I have found the faith deep within  
There's a promise I have made  
There's a dream I'm gonna follow  
There's another chance to begin  
And it's coming as sure as the heavens  
I can feel it right here in my heart  
  
Love is on the way  
On wings of angels  
I know its true, I feel it coming through  
Love is on the way  
Time is turning the pages  
I don't know when  
But love will find me again  
  
(Oh I know, I know down deep  
down in my heart I know that)  
  
Love is on the way  
On wings of angels  
I know its true, I feel it coming through  
Love is on the way  
Time is turning the pages  
I don't know when  
But love will find me again  
  
I don't know when  
But love will find me again

On est venu de la Terre  
En explorateurs d'univers  
On a quitt? La Voie Lact? E  
Il y a d? J? 50 ann? Es-lumi? Re  
  
De tous les temps sur tous les continents  
Des hommes sont pass? S en conteurs d'histoires  
Laissant derri? Re eux amour, espoirs  
Comme lumi? Re pour? Clairer le noir  
  
O? Sont ces hommes? Je voudrais le savoir.  
On en aurait besoin chez nous  
  
Parlez-nous, parlez-nous de vous  
Parlez-nous parlez-nous parlez-nous de vous, de vous  
  
(bis)  
  
Je veux savoir  
Qui sont ces hommes, o? Sont-ils pass? S?  
On a besoin de ces hommes chez nous  
  
Parlez-nous, parlez-nous de vous, de vous  
Parlez-nous parlez-nous parlez-nous de vous  
Parlez-nous, parlez-nous de vous  
  
L'univers a besoin d'amour  
L'univers a besoin d'amour  
L'univers a besoin d'amour  
L'univers a besoin d'amour  
  
L'univers...

White chocolate kisses under the stars  
Riding on horses, boys with guitars  
If you really wanna get the root of me  
You don't have to try so hard  
Give me a reason to dance in the dark  
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart  
If you wanna know how to get to me  
Follow the map to my heart  
I cry for no reason  
I laugh at awkward moments  
There's no manual that explains where I'm going  
So show me the way, show me the way  
White chocolate kisses under the stars  
Riding on horses, boys with guitars  
If you really want to know how to get to me  
Follow the map to my heart  
You played that thing like you're talking again  
You strum those strings like an angel of love  
Did you notice I can't focus on nothing else?  
What's making me come out of my shell?  
Sometimes it's so hard to tell  
I don't even know myself when you do, yeah, you do  
Oh baby, don't ask for directions  
I'm tired of explaining  
There's no book I've read that says what I'm saying  
So show me the way, show me the way  
Give me a reason to dance in the dark  
Be there to catch me and I'll fall apart  
If you really want to get the root of me  
You don't have to try so hard  
If you wanna know how to get to me  
Then follow the map to my heart  
Just follow it, baby, to my, to my heart  
Just follow
