The bars are crowded with wasted youth  
You just went, you didn't know the truth  
You don't know that kid when you look back  
You remember the music, paint it black  
  
You had a brother in the movement and he burned his card  
He's got a job in the white house, ain't life hard  
You came back a hero on a stolen horse  
You say you don't fit in, you can't stay the course  
  
I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong  
It's a veteran's song  
I may be right, don't care if I'm wrong  
It's a veteran's song  
  
The band paraded playing "Oh gung ho""  
Your country needs you, you've got to go  
When you came over they said "Soldier go back"  
When you came home they put you on the rack  
  
Between agent orange and the jungle and fear  
You're just surviving to get out of here  
You smoke some more herb and you keep your head down  
Could be your number is on the next round.

I got a maseratti two by two  
With snakeskin upholstery  
Charge account at goldblatz  
But I aint got you  
I got a closet full of clothes  
And no matter where I goes  
You keeps a ring in my nose  
But I aint got you  
I got a tavern, a liquor store  
I play the numbers, 444  
I got mojo don't you know  
Im all dressed up with no place to go  
I got women to the right of me  
I got women to the left of me  
I got women all around me  
But I aint got you, no I aint got you  
I got a tavern, and a liquor store  
I play the numbers, 444  
I got mojo don't you know  
But I aint got you  
No, I aint got you  
No, I aint got you  
No, I aint got you

So you've run outa numbers  
And you've run outa lovers  
They won't deliver that pizza  
  
You're hungry under the covers  
You're all alone in the moonlight  
Got to get ready for daylight  
  
All night, all night  
Listening to the all night radio  
  
You could have been sleepin'  
You could have done anythin'  
But everbody's singin'  
Good morin'  
  
All night, all night  
Listening to the all night  
All night radio

I know you  
You always rode so tall in the saddle  
You are the answer  
But I know that you are only causin' trouble  
Take all you want, leave me the rest behind  
You're a user  
A winnin' no new friends, just make one small step  
You're a user  
You never came to anyone's call  
Spent all your life head on the wall  
While you're up there, there's only one way to fall  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Will never put you together again  
  
You still got your chances  
The one thing the whole world loves is a winner  
You can't walk on water  
With your heat the ice you're on is gettin' thinner  
You used to be so wise  
But you are fooled by your own lies  
And I see right through your disguise  
  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Will never put you together again  
All the king's horses and all the king's men  
Will never put you together again

So your plane was late  
You missed that date  
And your horse can't win  
So you drink another bottle of gin  
  
And your shares went down  
They touched the ground  
And your best laid plans  
Have slipped right out of your hands  
  
So you think you're fat  
Well that's a fact  
But your well ran dry  
So you had to walk another mile  
  
Think about them, think about them  
Think about those who'll never see another year  
Think about them  
Think about those who never saw  
  
So your car won't start  
Needs a special part  
But you made your choice  
Now you're stuck with all your big boys toys  
  
Now the word's around  
You've gone aground  
And you've lost your wind  
You'll never see your ship come in  
  
Think about them, think about them  
Think about those who'll never see another year  
Think about them  
Think about those who'll never see another year  
  
Mother's, father's  
Sister's, brother's  
Old man, young man  
Whale song, all gone  
Where did we go wrong  
  
Think about those who'll never see another  
Those who'll never see another  
Those who'll never see  
Think about them, think about them.

You didn't listen when you went to school  
You dressed like a clown and you behaved like a fool  
But now your education is about to begin  
The difference between love and the mess that you're in  
You figured you're cool I'll bend all the rules  
I'll get them going red flags to a bull  
It's not like the movies no duel in the sun  
You need the answer to get your love done  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
You know the business or so you believe  
You set all your sights but you aim to deceive  
You think you'll hit the target every time that you fire  
You think you know the difference between love and desire  
But someone's waiting to turn you around  
She'll shoot you down and put your feet on the ground  
It's not like dreamin' you can make mistakes  
A lesson learned is not so easy to take  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
You're doin' numbers but you don't keep the score  
They're scratchin' the surface but they don't  
Reach the core  
You only bought the ticket 'cause the price was "all in"  
You'll never reach the heart until you've broken the skin  
You're busy running but you never relax  
Live now pay later including the tax  
But now your education is about to begin  
Forget about the stories and the places you've been  
Now you're going back to school  
Now you're going to learn the rules  
Now you're going back, you're going back  
You're going back to school  
Back to school back to school

Presidents and peace spreading poets  
Getting gunned down in the streets  
Shown to us on our prime time screens  
For our tea time treat  
Lunatics we voted for denying  
Everything that they swore  
We sit around and shout about it  
But we don't do nothing more  
  
Drafted for police action  
But they decided on a war  
Telling us we were saving mankind  
Why don't you ask Cambodia  
We were solving it with marijuana  
We were sure that we could  
Always leavin' it to someone else  
Just knocking on wood  
  
We're goin' back to the trenches  
We're goin' back to the trenches  
  
Well you say you got a say so  
But you're knowin' that it ain't so  
And you turn away  
You think it's safer to ignore it  
But the score is your children have to pay  
Everybody wants better  
Everybody talkin' 'bout it  
Are we wastin' time  
Gotta stop only lookin', talkin'  
We're all guilty of the crime  
  
We're goin' back to the trenches  
We're goin' back to the trenches  
  
We gotta move, we got everything to lose  
We gotta move, we got everything to lose  
  
We're all headed for the front  
But everybody's fightin' for a good address  
It's time we made the changes  
Or we'll be burnin' with the rest  
We just ain't communicatin' and I don't  
Mean conversations on the telephone  
When Nero starts to fiddle this time  
There's a lot more gonna burn than Rome  
  
we're goin' back to the trenches  
we're goin' back to the trenches  
we're goin' back to the trenches  
we're goin' back to the trenches

The backroom boys are playin' real hard  
There's a lot of money rollin' on the next card  
Some are goin' up some are goin' down  
Some'll never make it to the next round  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
You gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
They got--a room full of women  
A table full of booze  
Gettin' meaner with the dealer--'cause he can't lose  
Someone shouts out,"it's a goddamn shame"  
The dealer's gettin' meaner with the cocaine  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
Up all night, playin' it right  
Backroom boys  
Look in your eye, never say die  
Backroom boys  
  
The backroom boys are all the same  
Even take your money when they play games  
Take you when you're up, kick you when you're down  
You'll always be a loser in their town  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
Up all night, playin' it right  
Backroom boys  
Look in your eye, never say die  
Backroom boys  
  
The backroom boys are all the same  
Even take your money when they play games  
Take you when you're up, kick you when you're down  
You'll always be a loser in their town  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
  
Stone me it don't come free  
Gotta be a winner  
If you want to be a backroom boy  
Can't stay home get uptown  
Get your ear to the ground  
If you want to be a backroom boy

I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
Said I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
  
Come take me to your house  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
Well I made my first kill  
With the old town girl  
  
She was the apple of her daddy's eye  
Well that woman looked up at me  
And I said honey we'll be  
Together 'till the day I die  
  
But I lied  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
Come take me to your house  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
There seems to be no end  
  
Of women who are lookin' for a man  
My services don't come cheap  
But I help out when I can  
Tell them lies that they want to hear  
  
And I really lead em on  
Spend all of their money  
And I'm long, gone  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
Come take me to your house  
  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
  
I've got tastes for fast cars  
I don't want to settle down  
The good life sure come s easily  
With all the mugs around  
  
The women they just come to me  
I don't have to look around  
I move into their homes with them  
Then I move on  
  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
And I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
I'm gonna steal your love  
  
Come take me to your house  
Then I'm gonna rip you off  
I'm a bad, bad, bad, bad, bad,bad, bad, bad, bad,bad,bad, bad, boy  
I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm bad, I'm such a, such a bad, bad boy  
  
I'm gonna rip you off  
Just take control of your mind  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
I'm gonna steal your love  
  
I'm a bad, bad, boy  
I'm gonna steal your love  
I'm gonna rip you off  
Just take control of the time  
  
I'm a bad, bad,bad,bad,bad  
You know I'm a bad boy  
I'm so bad...

If this is heaven, then I'm in hell  
If trust is misfortune, then wish me well  
  
While I think of sadness, baby  
Your light shines through  
Your light shines through  
Your light shines through  
  
[Chorus]  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
  
I've lost control of my darker side  
A world, all for free on a nastier ride  
  
And I have crossed myself in anger  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
  
It's beggar's day  
You know it's beggar's day  
Because it's beggar's day  
  
See this love I've stored for you  
Wheel it and deal it, but our feelings are true  
  
And I have crossed myself in anger  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
All your mercy can't save me  
  
[Chorus x 2]

A shoe shine boy gave me a nickel  
With a smile on his face  
The school kids would give me some gin  
If I would let them in  
They were shaking all over  
  
Ran into a friend with a lonely lady on his arm  
Woke up in my garage, I was holding my own  
Can't remember where I'd been  
I was aching all over  
From rolling on the stone  
I was aching all over from rolling on the hard stone.  
  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy  
  
Kissin' cousins just ain't my style  
Not like some knight in shining armor  
Touring with the sideshow  
That was my blow  
But we hung on for the fun  
Lots of fun for everyone  
  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy  
  
Till the danger man with his danger plan  
He took me aside  
And then he took me apart  
I was a young man with love in my heart  
Oh, how he made me pay  
It was the hard way  
It was the hard way  
  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a real big boy  
Ooh, what a night you can have when you're a big boy  
Ooh, what a night!

Born under the wrong sign  
Trouble is my middle name  
Born under the wrong sign  
Every day turns out the same  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Cast out'a the wrong mold  
Sorry is no way that I feel  
Cast out'a the wrong mold  
Singin' my blues is for real  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
  
Born under the wrong sign  
Trouble is my middle name  
Born under the wrong  
Every day turns out the same  
But it's so hard to see the light  
When you're born under the wrong sign  
Wrong sign  
Wrong sign

Hey, you, who are you talkin' to  
Hey, boy, haven't you heard the news  
No one can fight more than these boys  
No one can bite more than these boys  
  
Hey, hose, who do you want to know  
Hey, punk, get off my case and go  
No one can fix more than these boys  
No one can kick more than these boys  
  
The boys in the band  
  
You can back down  
Yours is no disgrace  
No slack clown  
It's time to close your face  
  
Hey, now, what have you got that's new  
Come on boy what are you trying to prove  
No one can take more than these boys  
'Cause no one can shake more than these boys  
  
The boys in the band  
  
You can break down  
Yours is no disgrace  
No slack clown  
It's time that you knew your place  
  
Come on break down  
'Cause yours is no disgrace  
No slack clown  
It's time to close your face

She knows all about me  
She knows all my felonies  
She got the moves to-a-make me tremble  
She's got me on my knees  
She's got life-time guarantees  
'Ain't got no time for my innuendos  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
She say I'm to blame  
She say men are all the same  
She got the signed, sealed, testimony  
She knows a woman's place  
She knows where to rest her case  
She got her mind on alimony  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Hey, baby, bring it on home to mama  
Hey, hay-makin' baby, bring it on home to mama  
She wears a heart of gold  
Says her needs are many fold  
I got no reason or need to doubt it  
She knows she leads the dance  
She knows how t'wear those pants  
She got the full metal matching outfit  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
I don't mind if you make a dime baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bump 'n' grind in your own time baby  
Bring it on home to mama  
You can go blind, gimme what's mine  
If y'wanna keep this love alive, (keep this love alive)  
Bring it on home to mama  
Don't talk back, just get another kick-back  
This ain't no jive, (this ain't no jive!)  
Bring it on home to mama  
Bring it on home, bring it on home  
Bring it on home, bring it on home  
Bring it on home, bring it on home to mama  
Bring it on home!

She used to be someone you could depend on  
To brighten up your coldest winter day  
But the one she leaned upon  
Let her down, now has moved on  
  
And morning brings another empty day  
Now she's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way  
  
She used to be a girl of simple pleasures  
A breath of spring to chase your blues away  
But now she bears a cross, for a love that she has lost  
No sunshine in her life just clouds of gray  
  
Now she's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way  
  
She's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way  
  
Now she's only a broken down angel  
She's only a bird that's broke her wing  
She's only someone, someone who's gone wrong  
She's only a child that's lost her way

If it takes them so long  
So long to say yes  
Why don't they just say no?  
They don't need anyone to be put to the test  
Why don't they let us go  
  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
  
We needed a plan, we needed defenses  
We couldn't raise a smile  
As the world looked on, they raided our senses  
There can be no reconcile  
  
Burning down, burning down, burning down, burning down  
  
There was a time before life was taken for granted  
'Will never come again  
Our flower is dead, the seed is unplanted  
They put it all to flame  
  
Burning down, burning down, burning down, burning down  
  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be, livin' for the right  
Livin' for the right to be free  
  
Burning down, burning down , burning down , burning down

My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes  
And I'm busted  
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound  
But I'm busted  
I got a cow that went dry and a hen that won't lay  
A big stack of bills that gets bigger each day  
The county's gonna haul my belongings away  
'Cause I'm busted.  
  
I went to my brother to ask for a loan  
'Cause I was busted  
I hate to beg like a dog without his bone  
But I'm busted  
My brother said there ain't a thing I can do  
My wife and my kids are all down with the flu  
And I was just thinking about callin' on you  
And I'm busted.  
  
Well I am no thief but a man can go wrong  
When he's busted  
The food that we packed that last summer is gone  
And I'm busted  
The fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow  
Me and my fam'ly got to pack up and go  
But I'll make a living just where I don't know  
'Cause I'm busted.

Blind in my one good eye  
My mind just won't reply  
Somethin' from way down south  
Kinda formin' a dust in my mouth  
Lookin' for a place to hide  
Lookin' for a space to die  
Rattlin' like an old tin can  
I'm cruisin' like a laundry van  
Hot 'n' cold fever down to my knees  
Wearin' out all of my rosary beads  
  
Can't shake those shakes  
Can' t shake those shakes no more  
Can't shake those shakes  
Feels like I'm dyin' when I'm already dead  
  
Date with my medicine man  
He got the remedies I understand  
Gotta find the price to pay  
Gonna send me on my way  
Gotta desperate need, gotta feed the fire  
I got a chemical love and a burned out desire  
  
Can't shake those shakes  
Can't shake those shakes no more  
Can't shake those shakes, eels like I'm dyin'  
When I'm already dead, I'm dead.  
  
Don't care for sentiment, don't even pay my rent  
Got enough bad habits to blame  
Got enough of them to keep me sane  
Losin' altitude in this neighborhood  
Can't break the fall, though I know that I should  
  
Can't shake those shakes

Cat's eye, apple pie, what am I going to do,  
The woman I loved walked out on me,  
What am I going to do.  
Hound dog, bull frog, she just up and gone,  
The woman I love has done me wrong,  
What am I going to do.  
Green beans, black eyed peas,  
What am I going to do,  
The woman I love has let me down,  
What am I going to do.  
  
She's a delta queen know what I mean,  
As mean as wildfire lightnin',  
She can win and break the heart of any man,  
She's the delta queen of New Orleans,  
And she loved me somethin' frightnin',  
But she left me for a dollar wavin' man.

When I was younger I used to understand  
That when you're with a girl, you gotta act like a man  
Mama told me that's the way it should be  
And I know my mama never lied to me.  
  
What do you think about you're changin' times  
Cause when I'm with you I just can't make up my mind  
Since I met you don't know right from wrong  
Somebody tell me just what's goin' on  
  
Just can't get myself thinkin' straight  
I'm all shook up and in a terrible state  
Sometimes I think I got it all figured out  
Then you do something new and it just knocks me right out  
  
Someday baby I'm going to have to make a stand  
The way that you treat me baby  
Don't make me feel too much like a man  
And baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
You're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.  
  
Tellin' myself that time is on my side  
You're gettin' this feelin' that my mind's on the slide  
Dumped on the floor, I feel I'm trapped in a spin  
Don't know how to end, can't think of where to begin  
  
She don't care I know she don't even try  
But when she turns it on  
You know she gets me so high.  
  
She's a lady that's making my life a sin  
You know that I'm runnin' in a losin' race  
There ain't no way I can win  
Baby, baby, the changes you're goin' through  
They're drivin' me half crazy  
Can't make up my mind what to do about you.

Legs up to her shoulders  
All the way back down  
She's not playin', she knows what she's doin'  
And the word's out on the town  
She want to be a cheerleader  
A cheerleader  
She got the moves  
  
She got the grooves  
All the boys need her  
  
Oh oh that's the way she wants to be  
Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three  
See her - she want to be a cheerleader  
  
Now she's gettin' bolder  
Now she gets around  
She's not takin no for an answer  
She's not getting down  
  
She's a no teaser  
A no pleaser  
She got the drive  
She got the jive  
She's a big squeezer  
  
Oh oh that's all she wants to be  
Shake a little tush for the boys to see  
Want to be her - a cheerleader  
But what she wants the most  
To be the perfect host  
She wants to play the field all over  
  
She needs it most of all  
When it's too close to call  
She wants to rock and roll all over  
Yes all over  
  
Legs up to her shoulders  
All the way back down  
She's not playin', she knows what she's doin'  
The word's out on the town  
  
She want to be a cheerleader  
A cheerleader  
She got the moves  
She got the grooves  
All the boys need her  
  
Oh oh that's all she wants to be  
Shake a little tush for the boys to see  
Want to be her - a cheerleader  
  
Oh oh that's all she wants to be  
Cruisin' the touch line at a quarter to three  
See her - she want to be a cheerleader  
  
See, her, want to be a cheerleader

I am just a child in the sun  
Just another soul on the run  
One more of your unwanted sons  
Tell me where can I go  
  
I had a line I tried for a while  
Now I'm walkin' mile after mile  
On my face no trace of a smile  
Why does time pass so slow  
  
Take me down to the river  
Take me down to the sea  
Where I can drown all my sorrows  
Wash all my troubles away  
Watch all my cares sail away  
  
I have no ties my hands are unbound  
There is no friend no love I have found  
I have no ups I'm fixed to the ground  
Tell me river where you flow.

You can have girls and girls  
You can have boys and boys  
You can have sex and violence  
You can have space age toys  
You can have anything that you think will fit  
As long as it's box office, as long as it's a hit  
  
Cinema, cinema  
  
You can have birdmen and snowmen  
You can have women in red  
Hero taxi drivers talk about evil dead  
Black hats and white hats you know what I mean  
A flashdance welder and Jesus in jeans  
  
Cinema, cinema  
  
Norma Jean has gone with the wind  
And we'll never, never see her no more  
Jimmy Dean you drove that machine  
Chased a dream, chased a dream  
  
We've been up the junction, down the yellow brick road  
We've got beauty with beast  
And a prince with a toad  
We've got future adventures  
You believe man can fly  
Put on your 3-d glasses  
Get a shark in the eye

What gives you this crazy thought  
That you can talk to my woman  
What's your claim to fame  
What gives you half a mind  
To even think her name  
What's your claim to fame?  
What's your name?  
  
Gonna give you just one more chance  
To make amends to my woman  
You got yourself to blame  
Only thing that's left to do  
Is to think real hard about what you're gonna do  
About your crazy game  
What's your name?  
  
What's your name?  
Who the hell do you think you are?  
What's your game?  
Are you some 'Top of the Pops' star?  
  
What gives you this crazy thought  
That you think you can talk to my woman  
What's your claim to fame?  
What gives you half a mind  
To even think her name  
What's your claim to fame?  
What's your name?

If you want to go out  
You've got to take her out, cocaine  
And if you want to get down  
Down on the ground, cocaine  
She don't lie  
She don't lie  
She don't lie, cocaine  
  
Well if you've had bad news  
You want to kick your blues, cocaine  
And if your day is done  
But you just got to run on, cocaine  
She don't lie  
She don't lie  
She don't lie, cocaine  
  
Feeling is gone but you just  
Got to ride on, cocaine  
But don't forget this fact  
You just can't get it back, cocaine  
  
She don't lie  
She don't lie  
She don't lie, cocaine  
  
She don't lie  
She don't lie  
She don't lie, cocaine

You are a girl from the country  
Your eyes remind me of the sun  
You came to visit in the city  
And won the heart's of everyone  
  
You are a girl from the country  
Your hair is colored like the corn  
I have never been outside the city  
I am no friend to anyone  
  
[Chorus]  
Country girl won't you stay a while  
Won't you stay a while with me  
Country girl won't you stay a while  
Let me see you smile for me  
  
You are a girl from the country  
Before you came I was alone  
Please say you'll take me to the country  
And let me share your country home  
  
[Chorus]

Can you help me  
Help me get out of this place  
Slow sedation  
Ain' t my style ain' t my face  
Givin? Me a number  
Nine, seven, eight  
  
Gimme back my name  
  
Crazy  
But I don' t think that I can see  
You can hear them  
Only talkin? At me  
Livin? On the outside  
Lookin? Inside to be free  
  
Feel so good for awhile  
You don' t know why  
Cry while you lie  
You are true... You are true... You are true  
  
Save me  
Is there nothing that I can use  
Please believe me  
Am I conforming to your views  
Promise you anything  
Watch me cryin? Out to you  
  
Gimme back my name  
Let me make my statement  
  
(lead)  
  
Crazy..... Crazy..... Crazy..... Crazy  
Crazy..... A suitable case for treatment  
Crazy, crazy...... Just a suitable case for treatment  
Crazy, crazy  
Crazy.... Crazy..... Crazy...... Etc.

You came 'round today  
You never even knocked on my door  
Your note tried to say  
That you don't love me no more  
  
Bridge:  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man  
  
I had to be told  
From people that I meet in the street  
They are turning cold  
Without you I would not be complete  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man  
  
Why did you write me in a letter  
A word from you would be much better  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man  
  
Don't cast me aside  
Without you I could never survive  
Why did you decide  
To kill the love that keeps me alive  
  
I want you by my side cause  
I want to be your man  
I'm burning up inside cause  
I want to be your man

Locked up on Monday  
Lord I lost my way  
I couldn't breathe her name  
You know she's after my life  
Lately I'm stickin' to drinkin'  
And I'm headed down desolation road  
Habit -a- growin'  
Set it up just right  
I do away my life  
On a turn of the dice  
Lately I'm runnin' and hidin'  
Slidin' down desolation road  
(lead)  
No one to turn to  
Losing my best friend  
My name is just bad news  
And my account's in the red  
I'm in need of understandin'  
I'm landin' in desolation road

What you gonna do if the fashion changes  
Have you got a good song, can you go on  
Will you be so strong you can rearrange it  
Will you still have the thought to rely on  
Will you cut your hair, do you dye it yellow  
Are you still the right flavor to be tasted  
Will you have your name in the sunday papers  
Do you tell them you are straight or get wasted  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Did you ever think when you picked the front line  
Are you gonna back up on your promises  
Did you tell the folks you could make the changes  
Are you gonna play it different than the last one  
You got the address and you got the power  
Are you gonna use it right or abuse it  
Taking all the trust that you know youre given  
Are you gonna play the game or just lose it  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Do you have the looks  
Do you have the profile  
Do you have your fingerprints or a record  
If they come to you for some information  
Looking for a secret would you sell one  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do  
Do you think about it, do you think about it  
Do you think about it, Ill bet you do

Lord I swear, the perfume you wear  
Is made out of turnip greens  
And every time that I kiss you girl  
It tastes like pork and beans  
Even though you're wearin' them  
Citified high heels  
I can tell by your giant steps  
That you've been walkin' through cotton fields  
Oh, you're some down home girl  
Your shoes are green, your dress is red  
And your wiggy head is powder blue  
But underneath all of that mess,  
Well you're still the same old messy you  
You're sittin there in that fancy chair  
Just drinkin' champagne like a movie star  
When ya oughta be sittin' on a sidewalk  
Drinkin' white lightnin'  
Out of a jelly jar  
Oh, you're some down home girl  
Dimples in your pretty cheeks  
And dimples in your knees  
You walk by and baby I  
Can smell magnolia trees  
You tell me you're from New York baby  
But I know you're from way down South  
I can hear a Mississippi mama  
Evey time you open up your mouth  
Oh, you're some down home girl  
Oh, you're some down home girl

Dream on  
Though it's hard to tell  
Though you're foolin' yourself  
Dream on  
  
You can hide away  
There is nothing to say, so dream on  
Dream on  
Though it's hard to tell  
Though you're foolin' yourself, dream on  
  
You can laugh at me because I'm crying  
You can tell your friends how much  
I begged you to stay  
You can live your fantasy without me  
But you'll never know how much I needed you  
  
Dream on  
It's so easy for you  
Though I'm broken in two, dream on  
Dream on  
You can never see  
What you're doing to me, so dream on  
  
You can cross your heart and still be lyin'  
You can count the reasons why you've thrown it away  
You can dream your life away without me  
But you'll never know how much I needed you  
  
You can laugh at me because I'm crying  
You can tell your friends how much  
I begged you to stay  
You can live your fantasy without me  
But you'll never know how much I needed you  
  
Dream on  
It's so easy for you  
Though I'm broken in two, dream on  
Dream on  
You can never see  
What you're doin' to me, so dream on  
Dream on  
Though it's hard to tell  
Though you're foolin' yourself,dream on  
Dream on

Here we are in the west  
And our cars are glistenin'  
The bear he roars in the east  
But we ain't listenin'  
We won't play games in his backyard  
But we let him build his wall  
We say our god is on our side  
Hope he's listenin' to us all  
  
While we talk  
  
He's gettin' dressed, he's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill  
  
We got eyes in the stars  
But we don't care what they see  
We put a man on the moon  
We all see it on t.v.  
We all protest about his bombs  
He hopes we keep it going  
And while we rest he's marchin' on  
His fuse has started glowin'  
  
While we talk  
  
He's gettin' dressed, he's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill  
  
What have you got to hide at home  
His arms are stained but never empty  
The things that you think you own  
Are only for the few  
Don't you think it's time, don't you think it's time  
We got ready, we got ready  
  
We got right on our side  
So our leaders say today  
Count the size of the threat  
We can slide a different way  
Our planes are flyin' in your sky  
We know just what they're sayin'  
You see the writing on the wall  
Your nerves are tearin',frayin'  
  
While we talk  
  
He's gettin' dressed  
He's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill  
  
He's gettin' dressed  
He's lookin' for his thrills  
He's gettin' dressed to kill.

Now you say you're leaving  
Leaving me without a friend  
How can you do what you're doing to me  
How can you say you want to be free of me  
  
Now you say it's over  
And your walkin out my door  
Tellin me you're going away for good  
Never coming back and I'll never see you again  
  
Chorus:  
  
You left me here with my empty arms  
My empty rooms  
And my empty heart is crying  
  
Nothing is left for me now you're gone  
It just aint right and I know it can't last I'm dying  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Lead

She was my guiding light  
She was my day and night  
I hung on every word, no matter wrong or right  
She could raise me up to heights I've never seen  
  
And the coming of age is every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
  
She was the first for me  
She wet my thirst for me  
If I was feeling down  
She was a nurse for me  
She could take me up to heights I've never been  
And the coming of age is every young man's dream  
  
Oh, oh, she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
  
Oh, tu es toujours dans mon coeur  
I like to raise my glass  
I like to praise the past  
Some things go on forever  
Some things never last  
She could raise me up  
She was my fantasy  
And the coming of age is every young man's dream  
  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
Oh, eres siempre en mi mente  
  
She was my guiding light  
She was my day and night  
I hung on every word, no matter wrong or right  
She could raise me up to heights I've never seen  
And the coming of age is every young man's dream  
  
Oh, oh, she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream  
Oh, oh she's every young man's dream

If you're ready for the street  
You want to mix it in some fight  
Let me tell you somethin'  
Now I don't want to get you uptight  
But if you're in a corner  
And you can't find no way out  
Don't look around for no help  
No, no there won't be any around  
  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
  
So you think you got a case  
And you think you know the score  
No you don't want to listen  
You can't be told no more  
But wait'll you get out there  
You better do it right  
'Cause the streets are lined with things that kill  
And they're hidin' in the night  
  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
  
Feel that you can cut it  
You think you got the time  
They'll only give you one chance  
Better get it right first time  
And the game you're playing  
If you lose you gotta pay  
If you make just one wrong move  
You'll get blown away  
  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy  
Expect no mercy, expect no mercy

I'm a freewheeler, an underground dealer  
The kind of guy you never get to know  
So you can quit thinking about stoppin' my drinkin'  
You know I'll go the road I choose to go  
  
I'm a freewheeler, living undercover  
When things get hot I have to move out fast  
When they know I'm lyin', the women come cryin'  
But still I go the road I choose to go  
  
No-one's ever going to re-arrange me  
No-one's ever going to try to change me  
You know I'll go the road I choose to go  
  
I'm doin' fine, takin' my time  
I don't want to settle down  
No,no,no

Just sit yourself down friend  
Pull up a chair friend  
There ain't nobody here friend  
But the people you need  
  
Roll yourself a joint friend  
Empty your head friend  
Make yourself at home friend  
This is where you belong  
  
[Chorus]  
Put your feet up on the fire  
If it makes you feel much better  
Have a glass of homegrown wine  
Don't you think it tastes fine  
  
Tear you away friend  
On a planet to space friend  
Faster than you can think friend  
You'll be there before you know

Look at you  
You're the son of the neighborhood strays  
You can walk in your prison for days  
But you'll never get anywhere  
It's a pain  
But the shine on the edge of your blade  
Couldn't give all the waiting away  
You were recognized everywhere  
Turn away  
You are not just ashamed of yourself  
You're a part of the scenery,damned to hell  
  
Can't you see  
We are not going to play at your games  
We are not going to ask you for names  
Or for some of your history  
Did you know  
That your father said it's all wrong  
Just to keep it going along  
It's a part of our mystery  
It's our job, you see  
  
You'll agree  
There is no point in letting you go  
We can wait till the end of the show  
Till the audience fades away  
Turn around  
You can laugh at the mess in your room  
It's a nightmare that never can end for you  
  
Can't you see  
We are not going to play at your games  
We are not going to ask you for names  
Or for part of your history  
Did you know  
That your father said it's all wrong  
Just to keep it going along  
It's a part of our mystery  
It's our job you see  
  
You'll agree  
There is no point in letting you go  
We can wait till the end of the show  
Till the audience fades away  
Turn around  
You can laugh at the mess in your room  
It's a nightmare that never can end for you  
  
Can't you see  
We are not going to play at your games  
We are not going to ask you for names  
Or for part of your history  
Did you know  
That your father said it's all wrong  
Just to keep it going along  
It's a part of our mystery.

Well only you know what your thinkin'  
Come on say what's on your mind  
Tell me one way or the other  
I ain't got much time  
Gimme what's mine, gimme what's mine  
  
Well I don't want you to be wastin'  
All my lovin' or my time

Please gimme what's mine, gimme what's mine  
  
How can I get through to you woman

Yeah sometimes when I see you  
I'm scared to state my case  
Got to take my chances  
Will you leave or will you stay?  
Got to know the way, got to know the way  
  
I'm so tired of waitin'  
Somethin' that I got to know  
If there's one chance that you love me  
Then we got to let it grow  
We got to let it grow, we got to let it grow  
  
I just got to get through to you woman  
I want your lovin' so bad  
I'll take all that you give me  
I'll give you all that's mine.

Some girls got it some girls don't  
Some girls do it some girls won't  
Some girls want to run your life  
Some want to sink your boat  
  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Make you break you girls don't care  
Wake you shake you get you there  
Some girls like to play it cool  
  
Some like to kiss and tell  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
It's not new but it's gotta be faced  
A man can be turned by a pretty face  
  
Can't live with them  
Can't live without them  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls in movies girls in space  
Girls on T.V. girls that race  
  
Some girls want to tie you down  
Some girls don't want to know  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
It's not true but it's gotta be faced  
  
A man can be turned by a pretty face  
Can't live with them  
Can't live without them  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
  
Some girls got it some girls don't  
Some girls do it some girls won't  
Some girls want to run your life  
Some want to sink your boat  
  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls - Sweet sweet girls  
Girls - Sweet sweet sweet girls

[Chorus]  
Gonna go down fightin'  
Gonna go down fightin'  
Cause I know that I'm right and  
I'm gonna go down fightin' for your love  
  
Well I know what your thinkin'  
You got me up against the wall  
But the higher that your flyin'  
The further down you gotta fall  
Now don't you be fooled by my shakin' knees  
Cause I can fight dirty and when I'm scared  
I get mean  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I know you're thinkin'  
That the odds is on your side  
But the first thing you gotta learn is  
That it just don't come down to size  
I can see the seeds of doubt  
Begin to grow on your face  
If you want to back down now  
You know that's no disgrace

It was a red hot night night in Mobile  
Sweat glistened on the reverend's chin  
His mohair suit was shinin'  
  
He told us all about sin  
  
It could be wall to wall in Wall Street  
We could be livin' hand to mouth  
Jesus loved a Yankee  
But God saved the south  
  
Across the street in the pool hall  
Bubba put the eight ball down  
It's a high five celebration  
They passed the Jack around  
  
It's wall to wall in Wall Street  
We're livin' hand to mouth  
Jesus loved a Yankee  
But God saved the south  
  
God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Yes, God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Shut your mouth  
  
Some long haired boys with guitars  
Playin' behind the chicken wire  
They're goin' up to New York City  
Gonna sing about Atlanta's fire  
  
It could be wall to wall in Wall Street  
We could be livin' hand to mouth  
Jesus loved a Yankee  
But God saved the south  
  
And God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Yes, God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
  
Yes, God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
And God saved the south  
So,Yankee boy shut your mouth  
  
And God saved the south  
Yankee boy shut your mouth  
Yes, God saved the south  
So, Yankee boy shut your mouth  
  
God saved the south  
So, Yankee boy shut your mouth

Black cat, don't you look back at me  
Good luck, don't hang around me  
I been down so long I can't see  
Need something that's gonna set me free  
  
[Chorus]  
I need some good love  
I need some good, good love  
  
New love, just passes me by  
So bad, I don't even try  
Shot down and I ask myself why  
Needin' someone who's gonna save my hide  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Black cat, don't you look back at me  
New love, don't wander 'round me  
Well I try but I just ain't no use  
I need someone who's gonna turn me loose  
  
[Chorus]

Yes baby, I've been drinkin'  
Shouldn't come by anymore  
But I found myself in trouble darlin'  
And I have no place else to go.  
  
I got some whiskey, from a bottle  
Got some cocaine, from a friend  
And I had to keep on movin' darlin'  
Till I was back in your arms again.  
  
And I'm guilty, I am guilty  
And I'll be guilty for the rest of my life  
  
How come I'm never gonna do  
What I'm supposed to do  
Seems like everything I do  
Never turns out right  
  
That's how it is with me darlin'  
You know I just can't stand myself  
But it takes a whole lot of medicine darlin'  
For me to pretend that I'm somebody else.

Hard living, every day of my life  
Hard living, every night on the wine  
  
Never givin', any one any time  
Always losin', all I had all the time  
  
Yes I'm a selfish kinda man  
All I need is a helping hand  
  
Bad loser, never had anyone  
Bad chooser, never owed never won  
  
Fast mover, everyday on the run  
Never knowing, if I feel or I'm done  
  
Hard living, every day of my life  
Hard drinking, every night on the wine

It was a night, it was just another night  
She was sayin lots of nothing  
She was none too bright  
But youll listen much to anythin  
When anythins in sight, wont ya!  
  
Double back trouble like a temperance hall  
Shes dealin with the ceilin  
And the writings on the wall  
Then youre wishing it was over, like an endless fall.  
  
Its a lane side fight  
Oh no! Another main line ride  
Oh no! There aint a train in sight  
Oh no! Settin my soul on fire  
Try her and buy her  
Hire and fire her  
Playin the game his latest flame  
  
Now its a fine line between passion and dread  
Foolin and a droolin  
Starts rulin your head  
To seduction, destruction  
Were so easily lead  
  
And then the dawn, the so impatient telephone  
The smell of disappointment  
Mirror wants to pick a bone  
Its a cup of cold coffee  
Like the taste of stale beer  
Lets get outta here  
  
Its a lane side fight  
Oh no! Another main line ride  
Oh no! There aint a train in sight  
Oh no! Settin my soul on fire  
Try her and buy her  
Hire and fire her  
  
Carry the flame and make it last  
Carry the blame and kiss your ass goodbye.

Why don't you tell me that it's over  
Why do you keep this hangin' on  
Pack up your bags and run for cover  
Say what you mean and see it done  
Why don't you cut me loose, you don't need me  
Lift up your dress and walk away  
There's nothin' left you can say to please me  
You're just a dog who's had it's day  
You beat around the bush and mumble  
About the good old days we had  
Your face grows longer as you crumble  
You had the good now taste the bad  
Let it all hit the fan  
Let it all hit the fan  
You promised me nothing would change you  
More empty words from an empty soul  
The same old stories you still cling to  
The truth be told you leave me cold  
You used to lead the dance and fumble  
Howl in the night you could not sleep  
You climbed to the top of the hill then tumbled  
Too many promises come cheap.

Holy roller, lookin' down  
Where you think you know  
All the answers  
Arrogance and pride....are sin  
Better look to your, own chances  
  
[Chorus]  
Holy roller can you save your own soul  
Can you save your own soul  
Holy roller  
  
Standin', up for jesus  
That's your thing  
But you're standin' on peoples hearts  
Charity is a virtue  
To be praised  
Better get back on...Jesus' track  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holy roller, practice what you preach  
Heaven, it's still within your reach  
  
Holy roller, don't you judge  
What you think is goin' wrong  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Sad to be alone  
Your only comfort is the telephone  
Homesick again  
Thoughts of far away  
Silence is the only way to say  
Ain't it a shame  
What's goin' down, she don't understand  
Can't you be with her every night  
Why must it be, you're away so long  
But she plays along, and it's alright  
People all around  
You don't see or hear them make a sound  
It's not the same  
What's goin' down, she don't understand  
Can't you be with her every night  
Why must it be, you're away so long  
But she plays along, and it's alright  
  
Countin' out the days  
That don't help to ease the days away  
The price you pay  
Homesick again

I don't want to  
Go on without you  
It's so bad to be alone  
Oh baby come home  
I need you  
My room is so blue  
I keep seein' your face  
Oh, every place  
Here in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
I hold her memories  
And smell her sweet perfume  
I can't stand to  
Live on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
C'mon back to me  
Here in the gloom  
Of my lonely room  
I hold her memories  
And smell her sweet perfume  
I can't stand to  
Live on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
C'mon back to me  
I can't stand to  
Go on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
Go on without you  
Can't stand to (no, no, no, no,)  
Go on without you  
Oh my darlin' hear my plea  
Go on without you  
I can't stand to

I had a dream  
I had a dream  
I saw the mission band, playing on the green  
It was the saddest thing, I have ever seen  
What did it mean, what did it all mean?  
  
And in my dream, in my same dream  
I saw the soldiers marching, on the green  
The band played a funeral march  
Many a tear was seen  
All in my dream, all in my dream  
  
Lead  
  
I heard the lesson read, I heard the choir  
I saw the falling leaves, landing everywhere  
I saw the family gathered, crying in despair  
I was not there, I was not there

We made a promise  
But what's the difference  
Call me friend, what you calling for  
You couldn't take me as I am  
But that was only party chat, I ran.  
  
You asked me up here  
You said it was "gear"  
So Liverpool but  
We never understood the slang  
We couldn't sing it like they sang  
But that was carnaby excuses, I ran.  
  
Like rent-a-driver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You can only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you leave it  
  
Call me baby, how our love grows  
Supremely simple  
Like baby, baby, baby  
You're out of time  
  
Shine, shine shine  
Don't call me shine  
But there's no rhythm to your rhyme, I ran.  
  
Like rent-a-driver  
Insurance freeway  
You can never tell  
You only drive because experience  
Turns the corner now  
See what happens when you  
Break a promise  
But what's the difference  
Call me friend--what you callin' for  
You couldn't take me as I am  
But that was only party chat, I ran.

You have your rules and regulations,  
You say his love is my salvation  
Then talk of faith and segregation,  
You say that I must wait,  
He will communicate,  
I will not join your congregation.  
  
You force me into situations,  
Preach bad of sin and fornication,  
Forget your sworded celebration,  
My heart fills up with rage  
Who are you to gauge,  
The purpose of my world's creation.  
  
I cannot see the light your seeing,  
I have my own thoughts to believe in,  
I will not heed the words your hearing,  
I will not be accused, my liberty abused,  
You chose the cross that you are bearing.  
  
why want me to believe the word's you read  
But I don't believe in what your good book says,  
I just believe that when I'm dead, I'm dead.  
You say I must repent,  
Bow down and show respect,  
I am a man and I will not be led.

If you see my baby  
With another man  
Keep it a secret if you can  
  
If you see my baby  
With another man  
Don't tell me even if you can  
  
You know I could not stand the pain  
So if you think you are my friend  
  
I hope you never see her  
With another man  
But if you do don't you understand  
  
You know I could not stand the pain  
So if you think you are my friend  
  
She's everything I longed for  
She took so long to find  
But I'd be lost if she changed her mind  
  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby  
If you see my baby

I walked into a diner  
And the blonde behind the counter  
She asked if she could help in any way  
Hell, I knew by her smile  
Her number I could dial  
If I was in the need of company  
But as I bought some Java  
Instead she brought me a cup of chicory  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
Don't pour me water just fill up my cup  
You know it takes a lot just to keep me up  
Cost may be more than you care to pay  
What good is money compared to fightin' pain  
Don't try to cheat  
It's impossible to beat  
The only pick me up that's here to stay  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, oh coffee  
Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
The taste of Java is like a cocaine rush  
Nobody's gonna stop me from drinkin' too much  
Down in Bolivia the people are insane  
They want as much for coffee as they do for cocaine  
Don't try to cheat  
It's impossible to beat  
  
The only pick me up that's here to stay  
I got those Java blues  
Coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
The coffee's got me now  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee  
You know that I'll stay high  
I'll drink coffee 'till I die  
I got the Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, coffee, coffee  
Java blues  
Oh the coffee's got me  
Java blues  
Oh coffee, oh coffee  
Java Blues!

I'm goin' back to New York city  
Times square sure will be shinin' bright  
I know it sure looks pretty  
But I don't go down every night.  
  
I'm gonna take in Memphis  
You know the one down in Tennessee  
And if you want to boogie  
Now that's the place to be.  
  
Sittin' in a bar in Macon  
Drinkin' something called Rebel Yells  
When I thought I heard someone ringing  
I guess she's a southern bell.  
  
We just cut out of El Paso  
It just fries there in that desert sun  
And if you've ever been down there man  
Then you know why we run.  
  
I got jet lag  
And livin' out an overnight bag  
Time changes every day  
They do things a different way  
Back in the U.S.A.  
  
Tryin' hard to make a phone call  
"Long distance over seas"  
"Yes ma'am I did say Scotland"  
"Could you spell that again for me please"  
  
You know that it just blew my mind  
I'd love to go back there next trip  
I sure hope we get some time.  
  
Driving down a Detroit freeway  
Just lookin' at those concrete walls  
Hey but it's a good town to rock 'n roll in  
"What do you mean the police closed the god damned hall?"  
  
Flyin' home tomorrow  
To be there's gonna be just great  
And after some time with my lady  
I'm gonna be back to rock 'n roll in the States.

See the girl with the changing faces  
See the boy with the aching smile  
Empty love's burned out traces  
See them walking down midnight mile  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you  
Watch them dancing on a frozen ocean  
See them skate where the ice is thin  
Empty love that's a cold emotion  
See the tears falling in the rain  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you  
See the mist on the magic mountain  
Watch the moon in a blood red sky  
Empty love that's a dried up fountain  
Never change and never ask him why  
Juliet look what love has done to you  
Juliet love has made a fool of you.

Who took the smile out of your face  
Who put the tears and sadness in its place  
Who took the sun out of your sky  
don't turn around or ask for reasons why  
No place to run, nowhere to hide  
Its just another love turned bad  
Some smoke that's gettin in your eyes  
  
Its just another heartache, just another heartache  
Just another hurt to take  
Another bridge for you to cross  
Its nothing but a heartache, nothing but a heartache  
Just another big mistake  
Another game you have lost  
It aint nothing but a heartache  
  
Always wore your heart out on your sleeve  
You said youd always cared and needed to believe  
There comes a time to give, there comes a time to take  
But a sentimental heart will be the first to break  
don't try to run  
don't try to hide  
Its just another love turned bad  
Some smoke that's clouded up your eyes.

I know that she don't like me  
She knows that I don't care  
I could mistreat and bad mouth that woman  
Turn around and she'd be there  
She ain't got no pride she don't even try to hide  
What she does  
It's a buzz  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
She'll do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rock'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her head's full of rock 'n' roll dreams  
She's exactly what she seems  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
  
Hangin' around hotel bars  
Droppin' someone's name  
Usin' those lines that you heard before  
Playin' the same old games  
She ain't got no style  
Eyes that never smile  
Feel like you're on trial  
She ain't worth while  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
She'll do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her head's full of rock 'n' roll dreams  
She's exactly what she seems  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
  
She wants to interview  
Says the world should know your views  
With someone you can see right through  
She's just comin' on  
Tryin' to pretend that it's  
Just a yawn  
Ah, come on  
  
To be seen in your limousine  
She'll do strange bedroom scenes  
She likes rock'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it  
Her head's full of rock 'n' roll dreams  
She's exactly what she seems  
She likes rock 'n' roll, she would give her all  
Just to get into it

I got no time to eat  
I got no time to sleep  
I got a truck full of stuff  
Should've been there last week  
I've been livin' in truck stops  
My body feels used  
Got the hamburger that's right, yeah  
The kentucky fried blues  
  
Flyin' high in my cab  
Got my foot on the gas  
Got to get there tonight  
Showin' nothin' but a pass  
Tired of livin' in truck stops, have mercy  
My body feels used  
Got the hamburger, that's right, yeah  
Kentucky fried blues  
  
Even in the fast lane  
Seems to slow down my brain  
Got one hell of a deadline  
Riggers do not complain  
Tired of livin' in truck stops  
Lord my body feels used  
Got the hamburger that's right yeah, yeah, yeah  
Kentucky fried blues.

Two bucks an hour  
You can hire a car  
You can go most anywhere  
That depends on who you are  
You can be your own boss  
Takin' your own time  
The sun shines all the time  
California girls look fine  
You can truck on down the strip any time of night  
Pull an L.A. Lady to treat you right  
Stay home call her on the phone  
Sayin' come on over baby I hate to be alone  
L.A. Girls in the sunshine  
L.A. Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya, gonna go back again  
I'm gonna go back again  
Every one's in movies  
And every one's a star  
But most of them are fillin' in time  
Workin' in some bar  
They sure don't live in Bellaire  
Like they planned to be  
Their names ain't in the sidewalk  
For everyone to see  
But you can truck on down the strip any night  
Pull an L.A. Lady to treat you right  
Stay home call her on the phone  
Sayin' come on over baby I hate to be alone  
L.A. Girls in the sunshine  
L.A. Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya, gonna go back again  
I'm gonna go back again  
Word gets 'round the band's in town  
They're bustlin' 'round the hall  
Readin' last months Rolling Stone  
Talkin' Rock and Roll  
They got all the answers  
For everything you say  
And even if you pass them by  
They gonna tell you anyway  
But you can truck on down the strip any time of night  
Pull an L.A. Lady's gonna treat you right  
Stay home call one on the phone  
Sayin' come on over baby I hate to be alone  
L.A. Girls in the sunshine  
L.A. Girls in the rain  
I want to tell ya, gonna go back again  
I'm gonna go back there again

When the sun crashes into your world  
Look around and you try and find your girl  
And you're daring, too sick of what you see  
Out of town is the only place to be  
  
When your life starts to run out of juice  
Feel like dyin' and you just want to get loose  
Prayin' moves don't make much sense to you  
Seeing red before your feeling is blue  
  
Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn  
  
Going back, getting out of this town  
Stretch it lean and mean, it turns you around  
Take your dreams and stretch them out on the street  
Take your turn to get back on your feet  
  
Feel the wheels singin' over the ridge  
Feel the song like "Oakland" take you  
All the time you knew you had the itch  
All the girls were glad to see you  
  
Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn  
  
Girl in ol' "V" won't pray  
Don't give you a hard time  
All the girls from Brooklyn say  
Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn  
  
Do you remember the day you left the block  
Your mama said you would live to regret it  
Coming home, coming stoned, come in hope, coming ready  
Are you holding steady  
  
Last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn, last exit Brooklyn

If you tell me what to do  
I could do it quite well  
Give detailed desires, I'd be tryin' like hell  
You could leave a little clue  
I would follow it through  
You got to say somethin'  
If there's anything you want me to do  
  
Let me be the slave you can faithfully flog  
Let me be your dog  
  
I got no way a'knowin' what show is in town  
I could be your pacifier  
I could be your favorite hound  
Just gimme some proof, I'll deliver in style  
On a hot tin roof, I'll be burnin' the tiles  
  
Let me be the friend of a friend  
Of a stepmother's brother  
Of the slave you can faithfully flog  
Let me be your dog  
  
Roll me right over, I'll crawl and I'll beg  
Casanova rover, bitin' your leg  
Cause what goes around, comes around  
Simple as that  
You'd be doin' yourself a favor  
Cuttin' the crap  
  
Let me be your cross-breed, off the lead  
Chasin' my tail  
I could make you feel better  
Like a check in the mail  
Like a poll-position for the closin' down sale  
Like a hog in a synagogue  
Let me be your dog  
  
Call me Rover  
Let me be your dog  
C'mon baby, I'll be good  
Like I know I could  
Let me be your dog  
Hey baby, please baby  
Let me be your dog

Let me be your leader  
Let me have control  
The way I see it  
It's got to be right for you  
  
I could be your pilot  
Through the stormy seas  
The way you see it  
It's just a case of trust in me  
  
I could be your hero  
I'll be your piece of mind  
The way that I see it  
It's got to be good for you  
  
I want to be your brother  
If you need a friend  
The way you see it  
It's got to be right by me  
  
Winners--losers  
Takers--users  
What do you see in your crystal ball for you?  
Do you see an old wound fade into the blue?  
  
I will be your lifeline  
If your ship goes down  
The way that I see it  
You've got to have faith in me  
  
I want to be your partner  
Through the darkest nights  
The way you see it  
It's always just you and me  
  
Midnight screamers  
Daytime dreamers  
What do you see in your crystal ball for you?  
Do you see an old wound fade into the blue?

Here I am, sitting on my porch  
Thinkin' my life has got to be beyond reproach  
Have I forgot some friends close to me  
Real ones that don't use me  
And does my woman love me now  
Like she loved me then  
Here I am,my defenses are down  
Will she remember me when I'm not around  
Will she still dream by me  
Or will she find a new life  
Will I ever get used, to being alone at night  
I'll never know, but would it do me any good if I did  
Life is a strange brew, maybe we should not lift the lid  
Lift the lid  
I'll never know, but would it do me any good if I did  
Life is a strange brew, maybe we should not lift the lid  
Lift the lid

When the light comes down  
We're gonna cuddle up close  
Gonna paint this town  
We're gonna rub their noses  
Hey mama -want to know  
Why I'm never lonely?  
want to know  
Why I'm never sad?  
  
When the night comes out  
And the sandman rides  
We're gonna sing and shout  
I'm gonna take you places  
Hey mamma then I'll show you  
Why you'll never be lonely  
Then you'll know  
How you'll never be sad  
  
On your marks with the sun still pouring in  
Hold steady 'till we're ready for the evening  
Gettin' set, for a ride all around the town  
Then you take me where you want to go  
  
On your mark with the sun still pouring in  
Hold steady 'till we're ready for the evening  
Gettin' set, take a ride all around the town  
Then you tell me where you want to go  
  
When the light comes down  
We're gonna button up tight  
And lose this daytime frown  
We're gonna smile all night long  
Hey mamma and I know  
That you'll never be lonely  
want to show you  
That you'll never be sad  
  
When the light comes down  
We're gonna cuddle up close  
We're gonna paint this town  
We're gonna rub their noses  
  
Baby when the light comes down  
Yes when the light comes down  
Baby when the light comes down  
Yes when the light comes down  
Yes when the lights come down  
When the light comes down

Locked in a shadow  
Praying for release  
You found my prison  
Your love was the key  
So come on, light my day  
And come on, light my way  
  
Lonely's just a word now  
Something from my past  
Horizon's look brighter  
Loving you will last  
So come on, light my day  
And come on, light my way  
  
The world's now my oyster  
Had me marked "reject"  
You changed the story  
Gave me back respect  
So come on, light my day  
And come on, light my way

I don't want to take you prisoner  
Or do it against your will  
I wouldn't ever take you over  
Only want a little part of you  
Only want a little part of you  
  
I would never leave you stranded  
Alone on some point of view  
Couldn't ever hold you under  
Only want a little part of you  
Only want a little part of you  
  
I know that the world  
All it's diamonds and it's pearls  
Could never buy you  
Could never even try to  
  
Wouldn't ever bring you sadness  
Leave you standing in the rain  
Never thought you would be easy  
Only want a little part of you  
Only want a little part of you  
  
I know that the world  
All it's diamonds and it's pearls  
Could never buy you  
Could never even try to

It's three o'clock in the morning  
And they're sayin' you've had enough  
But you want another drink  
Good old north or southern stuff  
You're a boy from way down south  
Folks from the old north  
And it's Friday night  
It's party night for you  
  
King George he sent the excise men  
The Yankee revenuers  
It don't matter what they try  
They'll never stop the brewin'  
Because a man will take a glass  
To make his spirits fly  
On a Friday night  
It's party night for you  
  
They bring out laws and taxes  
Try to cut you down  
If you can't go to the corner bar  
Then you'll go underground  
So come on down to your local still  
And buy yourself a thrill  
On a Friday night  
It's party night for you  
  
(1) Whiskey the water of life  
There's more to it than the pourin'  
Oiled the reel on the fiddle bow  
And sent the music soarin'  
My old man and his old man  
They knew what they were doin'  
Lovin' malt from the old land  
And the corn from Tennessee  
  
If you're feelin' lowdown  
You don't need no pill  
Come along and join the clan  
Support your local still  
You can win your bar-room blues  
Find that hazy delight  
On a Friday night  
It's party night for you  
  
Whiskey the water of life  
There's more to it than the pourin'  
Oiled the reel on the fiddle bow  
And sent the music soarin'  
My old man and his old man  
They knew what they were doin'  
Lovin' malt from the old land  
And the corn from Tennessee  
  
It's three o'clock in the morning  
And they're sayin' you've had enough  
But you want another drink  
Good old north or southern stuff  
You're a boy from way down south  
Folks from the old north  
And it's Friday night  
It's party night for you.

I'm runnin' tired of this deception  
I have no wish to play this game  
Too many times a bad connection  
And you're still holding me away  
We're living under false pretenses  
Foolin' ourselves, believe the lies  
I could not take one more rejection  
You wanted more but would not try  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
We're trapped within our own defenses  
The walls we made all look the same  
There is no love without affection  
We've come to far to break the chain  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
I'm growing tired of this deception  
We fall apart and wonder why?  
Our hearts now pull in new directions  
We don't know how to say goodbye  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night  
  
Something's gone wrong with us  
Something ain't right  
Why are we lonely in the night  
Why are we lonely in the night

Lovely Loretta  
I'd like to know you better

Goin' on in your head  
Sweet juicy Lucy go crazy if you chose me  
Sure would like to help you  
Stop fallin' out'a your bed  
Lovely Loretta you know I'm scared to bet ya  
I don't know if I went if I'd win or I'd lose  
Stronger tha whiskey, ya got to be a Frisky  
But ya got something I'd really, like to use  
  
Lovely Loretta  
I saw ya in a magazine  
Set my details to the gettin' scene  
Lovely Loretta you're lookin' so good to me  
Helps to make my dreams reality  
Lovely Loretta, you know I've got to get ya  
You know that its only a simple matter of time  
Save my sanity,Oh , girl you gotta use me  
Loretta come and help me stop goin' out'a my mind  
Loretta come and help me stop goin' out'a my mind  
Lovely Loretta  
Lovely Loretta  
Lovely Loretta

Love hurts,  
Love scars,  
Love wounds and marks  
Any heart not tough or strong enough  
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud, it holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
  
I'm young,  
I know,  
But even so  
I know a thing or two, I learned from you  
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a flame It burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
  
Some fools think  
Of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves, I guess  
They're not foolin' me  
I know it isn't true I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie made too many blue  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
  
I know it isn't true  
I know it isn't true  
Love is just a lie made too many blue  
Love hurts,  
Ooo-oo love hurts  
Ooo-oo, love hurts, Ooo-oo

Love, now that you're gone,  
I just can't carry on,  
Love left a space,  
I can't erase that face,  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew,  
What will I do without her.  
  
Love, where is she now,  
I sit and think of how,  
She used to be,  
Happy to be with me,  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew,  
What will I do without her.  
  
Love, left me for good,  
I never thought she would,  
Now I'm alone,  
Wondering where she's gone,  
Love that I knew gone like the morning dew,  
What will I do without her.

One more promise soaked in rye whiskey  
One more word that bites the dust on some bar room floor  
I'm the man who travels 'round doing  
Hey, we don't talk about that  
I'll get the favor done for you  
No one will ever know  
  
Then I'll run to Mexico  
  
Cold as stone my eyes fall on another  
Just another name that's runnin' through my mind  
At your request I'll do whatever you require  
You give me the light, I supply the fire  
  
Then I'll burn for Mexico  
  
Pretty senorita, she lies to me  
Smiles sweetly in the morning when I wake up cold sweating  
'Cause some day I'll be in the sights  
  
One more call when someone finds a target  
Only guarded whispers never mentions names  
Money on the line will be just fine  
You'll never be involved  
And even if a clue shows you'll never know  
  
'Cause I'll be in Mexico

Light with the mornings goes  
I live a long, forgotten shadow  
Love with the morning goes  
And what to do I just don't know  
The moon is on the run  
Another day to up and lay low  
Mad dogs and noonday sun  
I need the darkness to show  
  
Moondance, moondance  
  
There goes a setting sun  
That's when we turn from strobe to struttin'  
Turn on the city lights  
Cause you know I'm moody blue  
  
Moondance, moondance  
  
The women shadow box  
They're dancing tough but the ice is melting  
The music gives what it's got  
The moon is looking at you  
  
Moondance, moondance, moondance

Walk me out in the morning dew  
Walk me out in the morning dew today  
I can't walk you out in no morning dew  
I can't walk you out in no morning dew at all  
  
Thought I heard a young girl cryin' mama  
Thought I heard a young girl cry today  
You never heard no young girl cryin'  
You never heard no young girl cry at all  
  
Thought I heard a young boy cryin' mama  
Thought I heard a young boy cry today  
You didn't hear no young boy cryin' buddy  
You never heard no young boy cry at all  
  
Thought I heard a young man cryin' mama  
Thought I heard a young man cry today  
You never heard no young man cryin'  
You never heard no young man cry at all  
  
Now there is no more morning dew  
Now there is no more morning dew  
What they've been sayin' all these years is true  
Now there is no more morning dew.

My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
Riding all around the street  
Four o'clock and they're all asleep  
I'm not tired and it's so late  
Moving fast everything looks great.  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
See that man, he's all alone  
Looks so happy but he's far from home  
Ring my bell, smile at him  
Better kick over his garbage bin  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
The rain comes down but I don't care  
The wind is blowing in my hair  
Seagulls flying in the air  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle  
  
Policeman shouts but I don't see him  
They're one thing I don't believe in  
To find some charge but it's not leavin'  
  
Lift both hands, his head in disgrace  
Shines no light upon my face  
Through the darkness, we still speed  
My white bicycle and me  
  
My white bicycle, my white bicycle

She came from New York  
Seems like a bright spark  
Knew all the answers to the game  
Moved to a new town  
Soon pushed her way around  
But you're a lady just the same  
  
She went the wrong way  
Tryin' to catch that boy  
He only used her  
Then broke her like a toy  
Like a New York broken toy  
  
Moved with the wrong pack  
Hard headed, well stacked  
Drop her guard if you drop her name  
Made all the wrong moves  
Knew all the lines to use  
Too many got burned in her flame  
  
She went the wrong way  
Tryin' to catch that boy  
He only used her  
Then he broke her like a toy  
Like a New York broken toy  
  
Since the news got around  
Someone I brought up town  
Needed a friend but no one came  
She tried to change her views  
But still she wasn't bad news  
Don't ever lose at your own game  
  
She went the wrong way  
Tryin' to catch that boy  
He only used her  
Then he broke her like a toy  
Like a New York broken toy.

She's a night woman of my dreams  
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam  
Silver stardust in her eyes  
In the way she leaves her sighs  
Last night I fell asleep  
Thought I heard her voice begin to speak  
My mind is in distress  
On my cheek I felt her breath  
I could feel her body's warmin' glow  
My frozen blood begn to flow  
She's a night woman of my dreams  
And I saw her glidin' on a moon beam  
Comes, stays, then disappears  
In the morning sun my vision clears  
I could smell the roses in her hair  
But when I awoke she was not there  
  
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream  
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream  
Oh, oh,  
She's a night woman of my dream  
Oh, oh, night woman of my dream

Slim Jim was a stool pidgeon  
On the payroll of the f.b.i.  
Reverend Fred sold instant religion  
With a license from the man in the sky  
Billy the kid was a gunslinger  
Edgar Wallace was a dead ringer  
Me, I'm just a rock'n'roll singer  
  
Keyhole Pete was a keen watcher  
Had a telephoto lens in each eye  
Jack the ripper was a cool stalker  
But his birds no longer fly  
James Joyce was a mudslinger  
Jesus Christ was a forgiver  
Me, I'm just a rock'n'roll singer  
  
I'm not fakin' it  
Foolin' myself that I'm makin' it  
I'm not fakin' it  
  
Tricky dicky was a fast talker  
But his promises were always a lie  
Nostradamus was a doomwatcher  
Predicted when we're gonna die  
Cleopatra was a love giver  
Jesse James was a born killer  
Me, I'm just a rock'n'roll singer

Ain't nothin' so good  
As a Sunday morning  
When the day is dawnin'  
Kinda makes you feel good  
  
There ain't nothing so fine  
As a lazy weekend  
Just hangin' out with your best friend  
There ain't nothing so good  
There ain't nothing so good as a good time  
  
There's nothing so right as the right time  
I said please don't count on me  
Said please don't count on me  
There's nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There ain't nothing so good  
  
Ain't nothin' so strong  
As the strength of a good love  
I can't get enough  
Can't ever get too much love  
  
There ain't nothing so right  
As the sound of your voice  
I'm gonna make it my choice  
And get into something good  
  
There ain't nothing so good as a good time  
There ain't nothing so right as the right time  
I said please don't count on me  
Said please don't you count on me  
There's nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There ain't nothing so good  
  
Sail away  
Can't drift too far  
Gotta get away  
Be where you are  
Sail away, sail away  
Sail on far  
Gotta find a way  
Into your heart  
  
Ain't nothin' so good  
As a Sunday morning  
When the day is dawning  
Kinda makes you feel good  
  
There ain't nothing so fine  
As a lazy weekend  
Just hangin' out with your best friend  
There ain't nothing so good  
There ain't nothing so good as a good time  
Ain't nothing so right as the right time  
I said please don't count on me  
Said please don't count on me  
There's nothing so good as a good time  
Maybe there should  
There ain't nothing so good  
  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good  
Nothin' so good as a good time  
Good, good, nothin' so good

I'm beggin' forgiveness  
But it's gonna take a miracle  
'cause I've been lyin'  
She don't want to know and I think it's impossible  
  
Said open up woman  
I know that you're sad and lonely  
If I could hold you  
We could make it again  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
Open up woman  
Give me a chance  
  
No more lyin'  
No more secrets  
If I could make you  
I would take you away and cover up your sadness  
I keep sayin' open up woman  
But you don't want to hear my promise  
If I can't have you  
Then I don't need a heart  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
Open up woman  
And give me a chance  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
  
Livin' in silence  
Of my own makin'  
Though she won't show me  
I know that her heart and soul are achin'  
  
Open up woman  
I know that you're lost and let down  
I'm gonna keep tryin'  
'Stead of losin' again  
  
Listen all you men  
Be good and be warned  
Hell hath no fury  
Like the wrath of a woman scorned  
  
Open up woman  
And give me a chance  
  
Open up woman  
Open up woman

Theres a paper sun  
In a paper sky  
Theres an empty place  
And I don't know why  
That paper sun  
In that paper sky  
Can't help me now shes gone  
I'm on my own  
Can't help me now, I'm all alone  
Theres a painted moon  
In a painted night  
Theres an empty plate  
And it don't seem right  
That painted moon  
In that painted night  
Can't help me now shes gone  
I'm on my own  
Can't help me now, I'm all alone  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all  
Theres a falling star  
And it wont touch down  
Theres and empty face  
Another lonely clown  
That falling star that wont touch down  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all  
And all the pain  
And all the rain that falls  
Can't bring her back  
She don't want me at all.. Ll.. Ll  
Ahhhh

I know the night is silent I'll be insane  
Got to find a new place where I can hide from the rain  
I'll wait for the weekend to get wasted and then  
Gonna get on up so I can fall down again  
  
Party down, party down, party down  
  
This world is crazy, everybody party down  
  
You bring the bottle baby I'll bring the glass  
I'll be the animal,you can be the class  
I know that memory that can shed us some light  
This kind of magic keeps me flyin' all night  
  
Party down, party down, party down  
  
This world is crazy, let's all party down  
  
I'm just tryin' to feel better  
I just want to feel better  
Don't waste your life away  
Eeverybody party down  
  
Gonna shimmer my shoes on down to the red dog saloon  
Just waitin' for the sunset to give way to the moon  
Been sleepin' all day so I can party all night  
Hallucinating at the northern lights  
  
Party down, party down, party down

Party in the Kremlin  
People seein' red  
Lenin got the elbow  
It's a different mob instead  
Party in the Kremlin  
It's the only place to be  
You better wear your Rolex  
Like a true new revolutionary  
  
Party in the Kremlin  
No more KGB  
So what is it they do now?  
Can anybody see?  
Party in the Kremlin  
It's the hottest spot in town  
Discos and casinos  
Never let you down  
  
Trippin' in Siberia  
Rock and roll hysteria  
Vladivostok to Moscow  
And all points in between  
It's a new place  
Got a new face  
And a brand new dream  
  
Party in the Kremlin  
Suits from Tokyo  
Guccis are a shinin'  
Smokin' Marlboro  
Party in the Kremlin  
Drivin' foreign cars  
You better find an angle  
If you want to play a part  
  
Dancing bears and presidents  
Acting under influence  
We got bank loans  
And cell phones  
And Levis to wear  
They got us linin' up  
For Mickey D's in Pushkin Square  
  
Vsea govorjat dal  
  
Party in the Kremlin  
Party in the Kremlin  
Party in the Kremlin  
Party in the Kremlin

Didn't I make you feel  
Like you were the only one  
Didn't I give you everything  
That a man possibly can  
But all the love I give you  
It's never enough  
But I'm going to show you baby  
That a man can be tough  
Come on come on come on come on  
And take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good  
You're out on the street looking good  
And you know deep down in your heart it ain't right  
And you never never hear me  
When I cry for you each night  
Sometimes I tell myself I can't stand the pain  
But when I hold you in my arms  
I say it again  
Come on come on come on come on  
And take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
You know you've got it if it makes you feel good  
Sometimes I tell myself I can't stand the pain  
But when I hold you in my arms I say it again  
Come on come on come on come on  
And take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
You know you've got it  
So take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart  
Take it take another little  
Piece of my heart  
Break it break another little  
Piece of my heart  
Have it have another little  
Piece of my heart

Is there a place in your heart left for me?  
Is there some space where the parkin' sign says free?  
Maybe there's just one little spot  
Maybe some corner that you forgot  
Is there a place in your left for me?  
  
Well I know you got so many you can choose from  
There's always flowers lyin' by your door  
I betcha your phone it never stops  
Bet you're the queen at the local hops  
I bet you get valentines but never keep the score.

Please don't Judas me  
Treat me as you like to be treated  
Please don't blacklist me  
Leave me as you'd wish to find me  
Don't analyze me, sacrifice me  
Please don't Judas me.  
  
Please don't chastise me  
Show me just one shred of kindness  
Try to help me see  
Guide me in my eyes of blindness  
Don't despise me, categorize me  
Please don't Judas me.  
  
No, no don't Judas me  
No, please don't Judas me

Make no lies to me  
I can see the way the wind blows  
Don't deface me, annihilate me  
Please don't Judas me.  
  
Please don't number me  
Don't betray my trusted promise  
Please don't anger me  
I find it hard to bear no fairness  
Don't frustrate me, manipulate me  
Please don't Judas me  
  
No no don't Judas me  
No,please don't Judas me

The phone call was wrong  
The i.b.m.'s have already gone  
Talkin's too late  
The future has ended now  
Can't change our fate  
  
So sorry now  
But that don't change a thing anyhow  
Let the games begin  
The dealer laid hands out that no one can win  
  
What made us this way  
Something I'm doing or something I say  
But could it be a fact  
That I never thought I'd get caught in the act  
  
And I, I don't know why I still keep  
Hangin' around when I know that it's time  
Popped the silo  
Pushed the button  
It's the big one this time  
  
Doctor strange love, we're all in your movie now  
You get no change love  
Your bill is too high  
  
The threat's on it's way  
The package from hell that you ordered today  
Pray to your sign  
Your wish has been granted this time  
  
And I, I don't know why I still keep  
Hangin' around when I know that it's time  
Popped the silo  
Pushed the button  
It's the big one this time.

I'm preserving myself with make-up  
Lookin' in the mirror  
I'm preserving my life, I can take it  
Shinin' in the spotlight  
  
Preservation, lookin' in the mirror  
Preservation, but they don't know that I'm scrapin' it all off  
Every night  
  
I'm reserving my rights, reputation  
Livin' in a movie, it's keepin' me lookin' right  
When the secret is out to the public  
Seein' is believin', they still want to be me at night  
When the parts get shorter, the parties get harder  
But that's alright  
  
Preservation, lookin' in the mirror  
Preservation, but they don't know that I'm scrapin' it off  
Every night  
  
They're linin' up to make their entrance  
When the word's out I'm in town, they're not nice girls  
But that's alright  
They're lookin' so much better when the lights go down  
But nice girls is just a frame of mind  
  
Preservation, lookin' in the mirror  
Preservation, but they don't know that I'm scrapin' it off  
Every night

Hear the whistle blowin' so long  
Tellin' me I gotta move along  
Coast to coast gonna steal highway  
Railroad boy up in the guiding daybreak  
  
Get no sleep in a boxcar  
Get no piece of line  
They catch you jumpin' a freight train  
They give you such a hard time  
  
Movin' fast as my time runs out  
Coal is something I can live without  
Railroad fever got me a route  
Like tumbleweed I ain't got no roots  
  
You know no peace in a boxcar  
Just can't sleep on a line  
They catch you jumpin' a freight train  
They give you such a hard time  
  
East coast towns they are  
Dark and cold  
West coast ladies  
They get right to my soul  
  
But you know  
Can't stand long  
Bet all railroader's  
Are singin' my song

Round about midnight  
I feel the chill closin' in  
Living my stage fright  
I need the sun to begin - tomorrow  
  
Thinking 'bout my life  
And all the changes she made  
And when she went running out  
All the colors fade - to midnight  
  
[Chorus:]  
What a bad week I've had  
There's rain on the window  
What a bad week I'm sad  
There's rain on my window  
  
Will I be staying  
Or am I moving in  
Am I still standing  
I've gotta wait - she's choosing  
  
[Chorus]  
What a bad week I've had  
There's rain on the window  
What a bad week I'm sad  
There's rain on the window  
  
When the sun comes up, it dries that rain on the window [Repeat: x5]

We've got to get it together  
You bring the wine, we'll bring the weather  
We haven't come to be clever  
Let's make it now cause this could be never  
Were gonna razamataz ya tonight  
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night  
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet  
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance  
  
Now that we've come to a showdown  
We won't allow you a second to slow down  
The moment has come to deliver  
You as the taker, and we as the giver  
Were gonna razamataz ya tonight  
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night  
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet  
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance  
All of the world loves a raver  
We're playin for ravers who savor the flavor  
You all appear calm and collected  
Razamanazin' you never expected  
Were gonna razamataz ya tonight  
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night  
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet  
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance  
Were gonna razamataz ya tonight  
Were gonna razamanaz ya all night  
Razamataz razamanaz up on your feet  
Let's see ya dance, dance, dance

Down at the house with the red light  
She works from seven til dawn  
You'll find her there any time that you like  
Some days a week she'll be on  
Down at the house with the red light  
  
I was a boy not to sure of myself  
When I was first taken down  
Down to the house with the red light  
Two miles west of town  
I paid my fee and I went on in  
  
Into the house with the red light  
Pull up a chair up the stairs  
The key was cold and dampened my hand  
Opened the door, heard her say  
"Into my room and set yourself down"  
  
She let us lie on this shiny brass bed  
Curtains and flowers in her hair  
She played my soul and she shattered my head  
Could not believe I was there  
Down at the house with the red light  
  
I fell in love with that lady  
First love I knew, she gave me  
Seven days a week, you can find her  
Down at the house with the red light  
  
I fell in love with that lady

Revenge is sweet and I can't wait  
Walk down the street, girl don't be late  
  
Now I don't want your sympathy  
So don't go sheddin' no tears  
For ev'ry wrong that you did to me  
I'll give you back in fear  
  
Now it's too late for apologies  
You've been through this trick before  
A million lies that you laid on me  
You knocked me down on the floor  
  
I'm gonna get you back  
It's just a matter of time  
It's a grudge I'll nurse  
I'll pay you back in kind, you'll find  
  
You had the chance to put things right  
But you preferred to be cruel  
I'm sick of pleadin' on my knees  
I'm tired of watchin' you drool  
  
I'm gonna get you back  
It's just a matter of time  
This is one grudge I'll nurse  
I'll pay you back in kind, you'll find  
  
Revenge is sweet and I can't wait  
Walk down the street, girl don't be late  
  
I'm gonna get you back  
It's just a matter of time  
This is one grudge I'll nurse  
I'll pay you back in kind, you"ll find  
  
Revenge is sweet, revenge is sweet

My head is dancin' like a ball full of fire  
Burnin' up with the flames gettin' higher  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like you know you really should  
  
We never have to say a thing to one another  
The band is hot 'n' there playing it like a mother  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like why'know you really should  
  
Get you on the rebound, catch why'when you fall  
Singin' "Long Tall Sally", gonna rip it up, rip it up  
  
Sweet is drippin' from the ceiling an' the walls  
Word is out.I hear the curtains gonna fall  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like why'know you really should  
  
Get you on the rebound, catch why'when you fall  
Singin' "Long Tall Sally", gonna rip it up, rip it up  
  
Rip it up, rip it up good  
Rip it up like why'know you really should  
  
Get you on the rebound,catch why'when you fall  
Singin' "Long Tall Sally", gonna rip it up, rip it up  
  
Ooh, rip it up, rip it up (rip it up)  
Ooh, rip it up, rip it up (rip it up,rip it up)

Said, don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever get sad when you go out on the road?  
No, don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever get sad when you come here to seattle  
On a four day show of the tour  
And you got nothing but groupies and promotors to love you  
And a pile of laundry by the hotel door.  
Don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever make a young man blue?  
Don't it ever get lonesome?  
Don't it ever make a young man where he'll just wanna go back home?  
When the p.a. system eats it,  
And the band plays some of the most terriblest shit you've ever known.  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you.  
I swear someday I ain't never,  
I'm never gonna go out on the road again.  
I swear someday I ain't never, never, never, never,  
Never, never, never, never, never, never  
Gonna roam the country side.  
No more.  
I'm gonna hang up them ol' holiday inns, dude  
And watchin someone do it on the floor  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you ever miss your house in the country  
And your hot little mamma there?  
Don't you better get a shot when you find out what the  
Road ladies do to you.  
What the road ladies do to you!  

When Willie met Ronnie he was runnin' up a track  
He was bent down, burned out, carryin' a sack  
Come on boy, you got to stop and help me some  
And keep this money hidden when the police come  
  
Ronnie was shiverin' and makin' funny sounds  
He was lookin' like a fox  
That was runnin' from the hounds  
Sure little buddy, I can lighten up your load  
  
You half it up, I'll hit it up, I'll take it down the road  
  
Never had a better combination been planned  
'Cause Willie was a roadie with a rock 'n' roll band  
They were heads back, celebratin', drinkin' moonshine  
Heads down, here we go across another state line  
  
Tanked up and bullet proof  
They couldn't give a monkey's  
Damn if he didn't hide the money in a drum case  
Pack 'em up, hit em up, do another show  
  
The robber and the roadie got a long way to go  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
  
Anytime they wanted they would pull another job  
Anywhere they found a place  
And it was fat enough to rob  
If Ronnie saw the police he would make a little sign  
  
Then Willie stuck the money in the band's back line  
In the main racks, bass stacks  
Anywhere he thought it could  
Be hidden out of sight  
  
Until the finished out in Hollywood  
Split it down the middle  
When they took it out the sound  
The robber and the roadie got enough to go around  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
The robber and the roadie  
  
Forty seven days and they had only one to go  
When the telegram arived  
To say the band wouldn't show  
The crowd was getting' nasty and it turned into a rage  
  
The bottles and the bodies started coverin' the stage  
Then the cops came running in  
And breaking up the riotin'  
When they saw the money falling  
  
Out the back of everything  
Hey little buddy think it's time to run and duck  
The robber and the roadie could be runnin' out of luck  
  
Willie and Ronnie had to skip it out of town  
They were sittin' by the highway like Jackson Browne  
They were stickin' out their thumbs  
In the middle of the night  
  
When they saw the car comin' with the spinnin' red light  
Wide eyed, tongue tied feelin' pretty stranded  
No use in runnin' they were caught red handed  
Pull 'em in, lock 'em up, put 'em in a row  
The robber and the roadie got nowhere to go  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
The robber and the roadie  
  
We got state police and the FBI  
Willie and Ronnie  
You get a big reward  
If you can make these boy's mamas cry  
The robber and the roadie  
We got the national guard and the bear in the sky  
  
Willie and Ronnie  
You get a big reward if you can make these mothers cry  
The robber and the roadie

She would never say where she came from  
And yesterday don't matter if it's gone  
When the sun is bright  
Or on the darkest night  
No one knows, she comes and goes  
  
[Chorus:]  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
No question why she needs to be so free  
She'll tell you it's the only way to be  
She just can't be chained  
To a life where nothing's gained  
And nothing's lost, at such a cost  
  
[Chorus]  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you  
  
There's no time to lose I heard her say  
Cast your dreams before they slip away  
Tired all the time  
Lose your dreams and you will lose your mind  
Ain't life unkind  
  
[Chorus x4]  
Goodbye ruby Tuesday  
Who could hang a name on you  
When you change with every new day  
Still I'm gonna miss you

Every song I sing's a sad song,  
Every note seems out of key,  
Every line I write falls out of rhyme,  
Since you're far away from me.  
  
Every night I watch the stars fall,  
Watch them till I'm fast asleep,  
But when I'm sleeping, I'm not dreaming,  
Since you're far away from me.  
  
Oh but I need you,  
Honest I do,  
You know that I miss you,  
I'll always miss you.  
  
Every song I hear's a sad song,  
Every word applies to me,  
Loneliness is something I know about,  
Since you're far away from me.

Hey sailor, what you think, hey buy a girl a drink  
That was the first thing she said to me  
I was on dry land but I was back at sea  
She was so pretty but she was so mean  
Cmon boys, Im sure youve been  
  
Chorus:  
  
Na, na, na, na, na salty salty  
Na, na, na, na, na salty salty  
  
Hey mama whats your name, hey whats it matter  
You just tied up from your long voyage  
Im sure gonna make you feel better  
She was a beauty she was so good  
Doin her duty now its understood  
  
Chorus:  
  
Hey lady, whats your game, hey can I play it  
Everybody knows when the price is right  
So just come out and say it  
She was a beauty she was so good  
Doin her duty now its understood.

Here we are  
We sail on a ship made of dreams  
  
And I  
I only exist to believe  
The stars  
The stars that I see watching me  
  
Hold me close  
Your arms and your love comfort me  
The sea  
Is deep and it waits endlessly  
Oh why  
To give just to take it from me  
  
Here we are  
We sail on a ship made of dreams  
And I  
I watch for a sign constantly  
The sea  
Is deep and it waits ceaselessly.

His necktie is bright red  
From lookin' in one direction  
No flower child in his bed  
He's got oil well protection  
Just had to be a blind dog  
Chewin' on everything  
Took a slice of the blackbird pie  
She began her singing  
  
I know that your oil is black  
But your dipstick is pearly white  
Ten gallons on your head  
That ain't what I need tonight  
  
Showdown at the border  
Showdown at the border  
Showdown at the border  
  
The rendezvous was neutral  
He don't want no gossip headlines  
Her Polaroid blackmail  
He said,"No way I've had mine"  
Just too much for him to lose  
Because of some Cuervo passion  
Cold, cold forty-five, answered in Texas fashion  
  
I know that your oil is black  
But the dipstick is pearly white  
Ten gallons on your head  
That ain't what I need tonight  
  
Showdown at the border  
Showdown at the border  
Showdown at the border  
  
Bright red went to his head  
Tequila tension rising  
  
This is no business for the weak at heart  
This is no business for those with a  
Nervous disposition  
  
Tanned man from the f.e.d.'s  
Cool mohair buying off the squeeze  
  
Showdown at the border

Swingin' my sweet chariot low  
Gotta make it home to georgia  
Excise lawman on my trail  
I'm a silver dollar forger  
I see a road block on my right  
Engine take me through the night  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.  
  
Twenty miles from that Georgia state  
I can hear the sirens wailing  
If only I can cross that line  
And leave the police trailing  
I see a red light at my rear  
Now I'm sweatin' cold steel fear  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.  
  
I'm tired of all this running  
Hiding from the light  
I want to walk out in the sun  
  
I'll soon be home I can see the clay  
I'll soon be in Atlanta  
If only I can hold that line  
I can live just how I want to  
I see the state line in my lights  
Engine take me through the night  
Gotta make it home to the arms of my sweet baby.

I prayed to God and Jesus  
But I guess they didn't hear  
My sacrifice was useless  
My pleas fell on deaf ears  
So I cried in desperation  
Bowed to evil sorcery  
  
I looked to the Lord in heaven  
But he must have looked away  
My crying eyes repentant  
Please send her love to light my day  
So I cried in desperation  
Bowed to evil sorcery  
  
I sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul to the devil  
So I cried in desperation  
Bowed to evil sorcery  
I sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul to the devil  
Sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
sold my soul to the devil  
to the devil  
Sold my soul  
Sold my soul  
I sold my soul  
I sold my soul  
I sold my soul to the devil

Goin' out, got some time to use  
Baby, baby, baby, I just can't lose  
Truckin' round from town to town  
Got to get my rocks off the ground  
Going up, I've been down so long  
All I need is just one good song  
Take me out of this dead end gig  
Get my shot at some of the big  
If you want to rock  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody to roll  
I just signed my life away  
The record company's got to pay  
Got to chase that billboard bullet  
Nothin' left but to go out and do it  
If you want to rock  
You got to find  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody to roll  
Somebody to roll  
Goin' out, got some time to use  
Baby, baby, baby, I just can't lose  
Truckin' round from town to town  
Got to get my rocks off the ground  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody  
If you want to rock  
You got to find somebody to roll  
Somebody to roll

I'm gonna keep it in the family  
Gotta straighten my face  
Want to keep it in the family  
Savin' my disgrace  
Like a tick-a time bomb inside a'me  
Been to the mount, seen the other side  
Money back, number one, guaranteed  
Sole-satisfied  
  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
  
Everybody celebrate, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
Easy access, easy led, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
  
Why 'know its nothin' new I'm telling you  
Its always been around  
Its the home made milkshake  
Apple pies 'n' lemonade  
Never turned down  
  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
  
Everybody celebrate, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
Easy access, easy led, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
Gimme, gimme, gimme it all  
  
Everybody celebrate, stand by your beds  
By your beds  
Easy access, easy led, stand by your beds  
By your beds

Walkin' alone at night in the cold rain  
Wond'rin if I will see you again  
In some corner light  
Runnin' down the road in the warm sun  
Dreaming that I am still the one  
Resting by your side  
  
You took the road to fortune and fame  
Your name in lights  
I want you to know I still feel the same  
Star, I still love you  
I still love you  
  
Remembering when you played me that first song  
The first show that you asked me along  
Just to be around  
Workin' so hard till you got that first break  
You said you could turn them around  
Give them something new  
  
You took the road to fortune and fame  
Your name in lights  
I want you to know I still feel the same  
Star, I still love you  
I still love you  
  
Got that photograph of you and me  
I hear your voice on the radio  
Will I ever lay with you again  
  
Nobody planned it we just seemed to drift now  
I always seem to have to leave  
Just as you come around  
But someday soon girl I just got to see  
I just gotta find out  
If we still have time  
  
You took the road to fortune and fame  
Your name in lights  
I want you to know I still feel the same  
Star, I still love you  
I still love you

Sunshine, every single day  
Helps to light my way  
And darlin', right before my eyes  
It don't come as no surprise  
That it's easy  
Easy lovin' you  
  
And baby,'til you came along  
There was always something wrong  
Around me  
There was emptiness of course  
But it's alright  
And it's easy  
Easy lovin' you  
  
And sunshine, having you around  
You're the light I never found  
And darlin',every minute you're away  
But it's brighter  
And it's easy  
Easy lovin' you

By: Chuck Berry as done by Nazareth  
Nineteeen years old and as sweet as she can be  
Dressed up like a downtown Christmas tree  
Dancin' and hummin' a rock-roll melody  
She's the daughter of a well-respected man  
Who taught her how to judge and understand  
Soon she became a rock-roll music fan  
Sweet little rock and roller, sweet little rock and roller  
Papa don't have to scold her, says he can't hardly hold her  
She never gets any older, sweet little rock and roller  
Should've seen her eyes when the band began to play  
Famous singers sang and barred away  
Stars performed, she screamed and yelled "Hooray!"  
Ten thousand eyes were watching her leave the floor  
Five thousand tongues were screaming out "More! More!"  
About fifteen hundred waitin' outside the door  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Papa don't have to scold her, says he can't hardly hold her  
She never gets any older, sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller  
Sweet little rock and roller

Goodbye romance can't take a chance  
On love's painful games  
I've called too many times on a sweetheart tree  
  
Lady lost now I count the cost  
Nothing seems to change  
I've called too many times on the sweetheart tree  
  
Too many times  
Ooh love you made a fool out of me  
You won again  
So lovin' set me free  
  
I need some time to change my mind  
Before I try again  
I've been too many times to the sweetheart tree  
  
Some go some then lay in tow  
But love just don't come free  
I've called too many names on the sweetheart tree  
  
Too many times  
Ooh love you made a fool out of me  
You won again  
So lovin' set me free  
  
Too many times  
Ooh love you made a fool out of me  
You won again  
So lovin' set me free  
  
Goodbye romance can't take a chance  
On love's painful games  
I've called too many names on the sweetheart tree

Well, some contend that this rock n' roll  
Is bad for the body, bad for the soul  
Bad for the heart, bad for the mind  
Bad for the deaf and bad for the blind  
It makes some men crazy and then they talk like fools  
It makes some men crazy and then they start to drool  
  
Unscrupulous operators could confuse  
Could exploit and deceive  
The conditional reflex theories  
Change the probabilities, I said it's a  
Crass and raucous crackass place  
With a Pavlov on the human race  
It's a terrible illness, a terrible case  
And usually permanent when it takes place  
  
It's a teenage nervous breakdown  
It's a teenage nervous breakdown  
It's a teenage nervous breakdown

Hollis Brown he lived, on the outside of town  
Hollis Brown he lived, on the outside of town  
With his wife and five children  
In his cabin broken down  
  
He looked for work and money, and he walked a ragged mile  
He looked for work and money, and he walked a ragged mile  
Your children are so hungry  
That they don't know how to smile  
  
Your baby's eyes look crazy and they're tuggin' at your sleeve  
Your baby's eyes look crazy and they're tuggin' at your sleeve  
You walk the floor and you wonder why  
With every breath you breathe  
  
The rats have got your flour, bad blood it got your mare  
The rats have got your flour, bad blood it got your mare  
Is there anyone that knows  
Is there anyone that cares  
  
You prayed to the Lord above to please send you a friend  
You prayed to the Lord above to please send you a friend  
Your empty pockets tell you  
That you ain't got no friend  
  
Your baby's a cryin' louder now it's poundin' on your brain  
Your baby's a cryin' louder now it's poundin' on your brain  
Your wife's screams are a stabbin' you  
Like dirty, drivin' rain  
  
Your grass is turnin' black and there's no water in your well  
Your grass is turnin' black and there's no water in your well  
You spent your last lone dollar  
On them seven shotgun shells  
  
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls  
Way out in the wilderness a cold coyote calls  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That's hangin' on the wall  
  
Your brain it is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand  
Your brain it is a bleedin' and your legs can't seem to stand  
Your eyes fix on the shotgun  
That you're holdin' in your hand  
  
There's seven breezes blowin' around the cabin door  
There's seven breezes blowin' all around the cabin door  
Seven shots ring out  
Like the oceans pounding roar  
  
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
There's seven people dead on a South Dakota farm  
Somewhere in the distance  
There's seven new people born.

I have not come to worship you  
Only flowers at your throne  
  
I have not come to plead or beg  
Or to claim what is my own  
  
Oh I know you are the king  
And you'll say what is wrong  
  
I have come to cut you down  
And to leave your body dead  
  
You do not mean so much to me  
Nor that crown upon your head  
  
You are just as sad as me  
You are lonely flesh and blood  
  
And the time has come for you to die  
  
And now you bleed, please spare my life  
You know I'm the chosen one  
  
I don't believe what you bequeth  
And I must do what must be done  
  
You say you're the only king  
Your words just fall like rain

Look out the left the captain said  
The lights down there that's where we'll land  
Saw a falling star burning  
High above the Las Vegas sand  
  
It wasn't the one that you gave to me  
That night down south between the trailers  
Not the early one that you wish upon  
Not the northern one that guides in the sailors  
  
You've got that touch so gentle and sweet  
But you've got that look so critical  
Can't talk to you babe you know I get so weak  
Sometimes I think that love is just mythical  
  
Up there's a heaven, down there's a town  
Blackness everywhere any little lights shine  
Blackness, blackness draggin' me down  
Come on light a candle in this heart of mine  
  
Star bright, star bright, you've got the lovin' that I like  
Turn this crazy bird around  
Should not have got on this flight tonight  
  
I'm drinkin' sweet champagne got the headphones up high  
Can't numb you, can't drum you out of my mind  
  
They're singin' "Goodbye baby,  
Baby bye-bye,  
Ooh! love is blind"  
  
Up go the flaps,down go the wheels  
Hope you got your heat turned on baby  
Hope they've finally fixed your automobile  
Hope it's better when we meet again babe

Once I had a girl  
She called me on the phone  
Said come on over honey  
You know I'm all alone  
But when I got to her place  
What I saw stopped me dead  
She was standin' with a shotgun  
Pointed at my head  
My My too bad too sad  
My My too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out fast  
  
Once I had a friend  
We had a lot of laughs  
He was all a friend could be  
Knowin' him was just a gas  
One night I got home  
he gave me one surprise  
He was standin' in a womans dress  
Lashes on his eyes  
My my too bad too sad  
My my too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out Fast  
My, my, my  
My, My, My  
Had a pretty wife  
She was all I could need  
Gave me what I wanted  
Never had to plead  
One day a man called  
And he put me wise  
she's doin' the same thing  
With ten other guys  
My my too bad too sad  
My my too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out fast  
My my too bad too sad  
My my too good to last  
So I'm cuttin' out fast  
My, my, my  
My, my, my

Turn on your receiver, I'm gonna lay it on the line  
'Cause I'm a great believer, in hangin' on to what is mine  
So come over here and listen, I don't want you to be missin'  
What I say  
And I ain't gonna waste my time sayin' it all again  
  
I've been hearin' stories, 'fact the word's all over town  
I've had my share of worries ever since you've been around  
So come over hear and listen, I don't want you to be missin'

Turn on your receiver, there's a message comin' through  
Keep your hands off my woman  
Keep your hands to yourself

Dragged up, raised tough  
Born a mistake  
Learned fast the golden rule  
Never give, just take  
Did no favors, gave no quarter  
You all know the story 'bout  
The lamb's Broadway slaughter.  
  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
  
Street wise, cat's eye's  
Show business smile  
Lookin' for today's mark  
On the golden mile  
Book wise, movie eyed  
So cool dudes.  
Ain't gonna do no talking  
When they find out they been used.  
  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
  
Got to make some time  
Go through the changes  
My whole life needs some rearrangin'  
  
Self styled reject  
Ambitious wisher  
Also ran life style  
Guaranteed user, like a,  
Campaign promise from a three time loser  
Got to make my move soon  
Because, beggars can't be choosers,  
So I'm,  
  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf  
Turning a new leaf

I've been up, I've been down  
Take my word, I've been 'round  
I ain't asking for much, uh-huh  
I said Lord take me downtown  
I'm just looking for some tush  
  
I've been bad, I've been good  
Dallas Texas, Hollywood  
I ain't asking for much, mmm  
I said Lord take me downtown  
I'm just looking for some touch  
  
Take me back, way back home  
Not by myself, not alone  
I ain't askin' for much, mmm  
I said Lord take me downtown  
I'm just looking for some touch

We only came here to play rock'n'roll  
Share some times with some people we know  
Drink some wine  
Give us some time  
  
We ain't no wise boys we ain't no fools  
We tried to play clean and keep to the rules  
We take and we give, just playin' our gig  
But we got laid over  
  
Ya we was done over  
Somebody tell us what's goin' down  
Don't need another Vancouver shakedown  
Six miles high, six miles along  
  
Chasin' the sun we've come to sing you a song  
Deliver our goods  
We're just rock'n'roll dudes  
All these behind us, and one more to go  
  
Fly to Vancouver, to do the lastshow  
It's got to be good, like we know that it should  
But we got laid over  
Ya we was doneover

Have you seen that vigilante man  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
I've been hearin' his name all over this land  
  
Lonely nights down in the engine house  
Sleepin' just as still as a mouse  
Man comes home, chase the crowds in the rain  
That's a vigilante man  
  
Vigilante man  
Vigilante man  
Well I ramble around from town to town  
Ramble 'round from town to town  
  
And they hunted us a while like a wild herd of cattle  
That's a vigilante man  
Tell me why does that vigilante man  
Tell me why does that vigilante man  
  
Carry that sawed off shotgun in his hand  
Would he shoot his brother and sister down  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
  
Have you seen that vigilante man  
I've been hearin' his name all over this land  
Vigilante man  
Vigilante man

If you want to walk out the door  
You don't need a key  
If you don't want to come by no more  
I'll set you free  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What you're doin' to me  
What you're doin' to me  
  
If you want to say it's a day  
I won't disagree  
I would never stand in your way  
That wouldn't be me  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe

That's o.k. with me  
Got so tired of asking you why  
I'll just let it be  
  
Whatever you want babe  
Whatever you need  
Just as long as you know babe  
What it's doin' to me  
  
And if I try to find a reason  
For all the things I do  
Would you try to understand , the way I am  
And how I care for you  
Would you give me your undivided attention  
And the benefit of your doubt?  
Ooh!, ooh!

You want me to be your friend  
Stick by you through thick or thin  
  
What's in it for me

You'd like me to deal you in  
Hold your hand right to the end  
  
What's in it for me  
What's in it for me?  
  
You want me to be your friend  
You want me and you want him  
This ain't for me  
This ain't for me  
  
You want someone you can trust  
You want love , you don't want much  
  
What's in it for me  
What's in it for me  
  
You want my name on the line  
I don't feel that way inclined  
  
What's in it for me  
What's in it for me?  
  
You want me to be your friend  
You want me and you want him  
This ain't for me  
This ain't for me.
