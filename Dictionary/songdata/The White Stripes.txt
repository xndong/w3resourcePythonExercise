I'm gonna fight 'em off  
A seven nation army couldn't hold me back  
They're gonna rip it off  
Taking their time right behind my back  
  
And I'm talking to myself at night  
Because I can't forget  
Back and forth through my mind  
Behind a cigarette  
And the message coming from my eyes  
Says leave it alone  
  
Don't want to hear about it  
Every single one's got a story to tell  
Everyone knows about it  
From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell  
  
And if I catch it coming back my way  
I'm gonna serve it to you  
And that ain't what you want to hear  
But thats what I'll do  
And the feeling coming from my bones  
Says find a home  
  
I'm going to Wichita  
Far from this opera for evermore  
I'm gonna work the straw  
Make the sweat drip out of every pore  
And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding  
Right before the lord  
All the words are gonna bleed from me  
And I will sing no more  
And the stains coming from my blood  
Tell me go back home

I just don't fit it in this place  
Their thoughts cast me out of here  
Their home has run out of space  
My mind's already out of here  
  
Won't you come along, dear?  
Won't you come along?  
  
Words that are spoke alone  
Phrases you will never hear  
  
Empty rooms and a telephone  
That I will never use  
Never fear  
  
I am all alone, dear  
I am all alone  
  
My dogs come sit next to me  
A pack of dogs and cigarettes  
My only friends speak no words to me  
But they look at me and they don't forget  
That a boy's best friend  
Is his mother or whatever has become his pet

Hey little apple blossom  
What seems to be the problem  
All the ones you tell your troubles to  
They don't really care for you  
  
Come and tell me what you're thinking  
Cause just when the boat is sinking  
A little light is blinking  
And I will come and rescue you  
  
Lots of girls walk around in tears  
But that's not for you  
You've been looking all around for years  
For someone to tell your troubles to  
  
Come and sit with me and talk awhile  
Let me see your pretty little smile  
Put your troubles in a little pile  
And I will sort them out for you  
I'll fall in love with you  
I think I'll marry you

But soon enough you will care by the time I'm done

Don't you think that I'm bound to react now?  
My fingers definitely turning to black now  
Maybe I'll put my love on ice  
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice  
  
My books are sitting at the top of the stack now  
The longer words are really breaking my back now  
Maybe I'll learn to understand,  
Drawing a square with a pencil in hand  
  
Mathematically turning the page  
Unequivocally showing my age  
I'm practically center stage  
Undeniably earning your wage  
Maybe I'll put my love on ice  
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice  
  
Listen master can I ask you a question?  
Is it the fingers, or the brain  
That you're teaching the lesson?  
Maybe I'll put my love on ice  
And teach myself, maybe that'll be nice

Hey, hey  
  
Look closer, you can see all the money  
I got a dollar bill in the cockpit  
Surprised that your wallet is a black hole  
I got another job at the liquor store, damn!  
  
Oh well, I'm bone broke  
  
They got a white pony in the stable  
And ride him when the doggie isn't able  
But he doesn't really care because they pay him  
But, still, a black suit is gonna shake him down  
  
Oh well, I'm bone broke  
Hey, broke as I'll ever be  
  
It look another way, girl, I'm telling ya  
God gave seven minutes right to ya  
And your mother put her money into platinum  
And now you never have to pay attention, do ya, do ya?  
  
Uh huh  
  
Yeah, I'm kneeling on a brick with my nails  
I'm telling her the money's in the mail  
Keeps shiny in my box, never fake it  
But now the brick breaker's gonna break it down  
  
Oh well, I'm bone broke  
  
Look another way, girl, I'm telling ya  
God gave seven minutes right to ya  
Your mother put her money into platinum  
So that you wouldn't have to pay attention, right?

Have you been to the broken bricks girl  
Snuck down through the cyclone fence  
Past the caution tape  
And the security gate  
Back way to the break room bench  
Well there's a little corner  
Where you first got kissed  
And felt your boyfriends fist  
And made the company list  
And there's a little spot  
Where your dad ate lunch  
And your brother landed his first punch yeah,yeah,yeah  
  
Well have you been to the broken bricks girl  
Seen the barrels that they left behind  
Seen the machine  
That cut aluminum clean  
And got tape from the caution sign  
And broke into the window panes  
Just a rusty colored rain  
That drives a man insane  
You try to jump over water  
But you land in oil  
Climb the ladder up a broken crane  
Yeah,yeah,yeah  
  
Don't go to the broken bricks girl  
It's not a place that you want to be  
Think of the spot your father spent his life  
Demolition calls it  
Building see  
Demolition calls it  
Building see now  
Demolition calls it

Conquest  
He was out to make a conquest  
Didn't care what harm was done just as long as he won  
The prize  
  
Conquest  
She was just another conquest  
Didn't care whose heart was broke  
Love to him was a joke till he looked into her eyes  
  
And then in the strange way things happen  
Their roles were reversed from that day  
The hunted became the huntress  
The hunter became the prey  
  
Conquest  
Now you know who made the conquest  
She with all her female guile led him helpless down the aisle  
She had finally made a conquest  
  
Ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah, ah  
Ooo, ooo, ooo

Dead leaves and the dirty ground  
When I know you're not around  
Shiny tops and soda pops  
When I hear your lips make a sound  
When I hear your lips make a sound  
  
Thirty notes in the mailbox  
Will tell that I'm coming home  
And I think I'm gonna stick around  
For a while so you're not alone  
For a while so you're not alone  
  
If you can hear a piano fall  
You can hear me coming down the hall  
If I could just hear your pretty voice  
I don't think I need to see ya at all  
I don't think I need to see ya at all  
  
Soft hair and a velvet tongue  
I want to give you what you give to me  
And every breath that is in your lungs  
Is a tiny little gift to me  
Is a tiny little gift to me  
  
I didn't feel so bad till the sun went down  
Then I come home  
No one to wrap my arms around  
Wrap my arms around  
  
Well any man with a microphone  
Can tell you what he loves the most  
And you know why you love at all  
If you're thinking of the holy ghost  
If you're thinking of the holy ghost

Well somebody walked up to me  
But I didn't know what to do  
And then somebody said hello to me  
But I didn't know what to do  
Because I think  
That my words will get twisted  
So I bend my back over  
Take a gulp  
Be funny  
Cause I know there's nothin' I can do  
  
Then my mother tried to pick me up  
As I was sittin' down on the ground  
Something forced my little eyes come open  
But I couldn't make out the sound  
It doesn't matter cause my eyes are lyin'  
And they don't have emotion  
Don't want to be social  
Can't take it when they hate me  
But I know there's nothin' I can do  
  
When my thoughts start to feel like mine  
They're taken from me  
It seems to happen every time  
And the feelings that are fine for you  
There's somebody there who doesn't think they are true  
So think of something new  
There's nothing left to do  
  
And then my idols walk next to me  
I look up at them they fade away  
Its a destruction of a mystery  
The more I listen to what they say  
So does that mean that's there's no more doin'  
And there's no more thinkin'  
And there's no more feelin'  
Cause there's no right opinion  
So can you tell me what I'm supposed to do

Your mouth said this never  
But your fingers have shown me  
Your head is so clever  
You claim that you own me  
Forever, forever, forever, forever  
  
You have the right to conduct me  
In whatever fashion  
Your attempt to construct me  
In the interest of passion  
You sent me  
To Toledo, Toledo, Toledo  
  
I came back with handfuls  
I did what you asked me  
But after the thank yous  
That you quickly got passed me  
I'm expected  
You're expecting  
I'm expected  
Expected

I fell in love with a girl  
Fell in love once and almost completely  
She's in love with the world,  
But sometimes these feelings can be so misleading  
She turns and says, "Are you alright?"  
I said I must be fine 'cause my hearts still beating  
Come and kiss me by the riverside  
Yeah Bobby said its fine, he don't consider it cheating now  
  
Red hair with a curl  
Mellow roll for the flavor and the eyes for peeping  
Can't keep away from the girl  
These two sides of my brain need to have a meeting  
Can't think of anything to do yeah my left brain knows that all love is
fleeting  
She's just looking for something new  
And I said it once before but it bears repeating, now  
  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
(Aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaah, aaaaaaah)  
  
Can't think of anything to do  
Yeah my left brain knows that all love is fleeting  
She's just looking for something new, well  
I said it once before but it bears repeating

Implanted in a pill?

I've got a 1980 Volvo  
I get it started up and I go  
It's not a vintage Cadillac  
And it doesn't have fins in the back  
But it always gets me there and back  
  
And it will always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
  
I've got a beat up Silvertone amp  
I plug it in and it sounds like a champ  
It's not a Fender Tweed Deluxe  
It only cost me a couple of bucks  
  
And it will always sound good to me  
Always sound good to me  
Always sound good to me  
Always sound good to me  
  
I've got a girlfriend she's so true  
And no other kind of girl will do  
'Cause I've lots of girls in the past  
And I knew none of their love would last  
  
But this one will always be true to me  
Always be true to me  
Always be true to me  
Always be true to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Always be good to me  
Good to me  
Good to me  
Good to me

I took my girl to go bowling  
Downtown at the red door  
After an argument I started  
'Cause I thought she didn't like me anymore  
I can't help it sometimes I feel pitiful  
And of course she's so young and beautiful  
  
I bought us two glasses of coke  
That's her favorite  
And I wanted to make up for earlier  
But I dropped her glass and it broke  
So I just gave my glass to her  
  
She laughed and so did I in our lane  
And then she went to the vending machine  
To buy a candy cane  
But right next to that was a boy I knew  
With a spring in his hand  
Playing a country pinball machine  
Called "Stand By Your Man"  
I saw him talk to her  
But I stayed in my lane  
And played my game steady  
And was thinking of a day  
When I'd be too old to throw a ball this heavy  
  
But I guess I'm young now  
So it's easier to knock 'em all down  
Then I looked and saw her say to him  
"You're really hittin' that ball around"  
And so he's lookin' at her the way I did  
When I first met her  
I could see in his face  
White flowers  
And cups of coffee  
And love letters  
  
I was sorry to interrupt their game  
But I went and did it anyway  
I dropped my red bowling ball  
Through the glass of his machine  
I said "Are you quick enough to hit  
This ball, Mr. Clean?"  
I was scared to lose her  
So I couldn't help bein' mean  
  
And that ended both of our games  
I said I was sorry  
But my girl left with him just the same  
I thought how much I hate  
When love makes me act this way  
I was bent over a broken pinball machine  
In a blowling alley and I threw it all away  
  
Well it's it all just a big game?

Hello operator  
Can you give me number nine?  
Can I see you later?  
Will you give me back my dime?  
Turn the oscillator  
Twist it with a dollar bill  
Mail man bring the paper  
Leave it on my window sill  
  
Find a canary  
A bird to bring my message home  
Carry my obituary  
My coffin doesn't have a phone  
How you gonna get the money?  
Send papers to an empty home?  
How you gonna get the money?  
Nobody to answer the phone

I was watching  
With one eye on the other side  
I had fifteen people telling me to move  
I got moving on my mind  
I found shelter  
In some thoughts turning wheels around  
I said thirty nine times that I love you  
To the beauty I had found  
  
Well its one, two, three, four  
Take the elevator  
At the Hotel Yorba  
I'll be glad to see you later  
All they got inside is vacancy  
  
I've been thinking  
Of a little place down by the lake  
They got a dirty little road leading up to the house  
I wonder how long it will take till we're alone  
Sitting on the front porch of that home  
Stomping our feet on the wooden boards  
Never gonna worry about locking the door  
  
Well its one, two, three, four  
Take the elevator  
At the Hotel Yorba  
I'll be glad to see you later  
All they got inside is vacancy  
  
It might sound silly  
For me to think childish thoughts like these  
But I'm so tired of acting tough  
And I'm gonna do what I please  
Let's get married  
In a big cathedral by a priest  
'Cause if I'm the man that you love the most  
You can say I do at least  
  
Well its one, two, three, four  
Take the elevator  
At the Hotel Yorba  
I'll be glad to see you later  
All they got inside is vacancy  
  
And its four, five, six, seven  
Grab your umbrella  
Grab hold of me  
'Cause I'm your favorite fella  
All they got inside is vacancy

I'm begging of you,  
Please don't take my man  
  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,  
Please don't take him just because you can  
  
Your beauty is beyond compare  
With flaming locks of auburn hair  
With ivory skin  
And eyes of emerald green  
Your smile is like a breath of spring  
And your voice is soft like a summer rain  
And I cannot compete with you Jolene  
And he talks about you in his sleep  
And there is nothing I can do to keep  
From crying when he calls your name, Jolene  
  
Jolene Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,  
I'm begging of you please don't take my man  
  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,  
Please don't take him even though you can  
  
Now I could easily understand  
How you could easily take my man  
But you don't know what he means to me Jolene  
Well you could have your choice of men  
But I could never love again  
He's the only one for me Jolene  
And I had to have this talk with you  
My happiness depends on you  
And whatever you decide to do Jolene  
  
Jolene, Jolene, Jolene, Jolene,  
I'm begging of you please don't take my man!  
Jolene Jolene Jolene Jolene  
Please don't take him even though you can.

Take all your problems  
And rip 'em apart  
Oh oh oh  
Carry them off  
In a shopping cart  
Oh oh oh  
  
And another thing you  
Should've known from the start  
The problems in hand  
Are lighter than at heart  
  
Be like the squirrel, girl  
Be like the squirrel  
Give it a whirl, girl

Well, every highway that I go down  
Seems to be longer than the last one I knew about, oh well  
And every girl that I walk around  
Seems to be more of an illusion than the last one I found, oh well  
And this old man in front of me  
Wearin' canes and ruby rings is like a tanging explosion when he sings  
With every chance to set himself on fire  
He just ends up doing the same thing  
  
Well, each beautiful thing I come across  
Tells me to stop moving and shake this riddle off, oh well  
And there was a time when all I wanted  
Was my ice cream colder and a little cream soda, oh well, oh well  
And a wooden box in an alley full of rocks  
Was all I had to care about, oh well, oh well, oh well  
  
Now my mind is filled with rubber tires, and forest fires  
And whether I'm a liar, and lots of other situations where I don't know what
to do  
At which time God screams to me "There's nothing left for me to tell you."  
Nothing left for me to tell you  
Nothing left  
Oh well, oh well, oh well  
Oh well  
Oh well, oh well, oh well  
Oh well

Oh, oh  
  
And there's a little girl with a tiger on her bed  
There's a little girl with a tiger on her bed  
Hello  
Oh, oh  
  
There's a little boy with nothin' on his mind  
There's a little boy with nothin' on his mind  
Hello

Look me over closely  
Tell me what you see  
The lady likes to look her best  
Before she pours the tea  
You said I'm [?]  
That makes the evening sun go down  
Oh look me over closely  
Tell me what you find  
But don't be over anxious  
I'm not the marryin' kind  
I'm a poor in a storm  
You'll harbor where it's warm  
In my arms you will hide  
From the great big world outside  
Oh but when you come and see me  
Don't try to change my ways  
You'll have a part within my heart  
And there you'll always stay  
There's room for all  
Not for all  
But don't blame me  
If you fall  
So look me over closely  
And then make up your mind  
But darling please remember this  
I'm holding you before we kiss  
So look me over closely  
Because I may be the marryin' kind  
Oh well I may be the marryin' kind  
Oh well I may be the marryin' kind  
Oh

Send me an angel down  
Can't spare no angel  
Will spare you a teasin' brown  
Well that new way of loving  
Swear to god it must be best  
For these Detroit women won't let mr. jack white rest  
There's a crowd on the corner  
Wonder what could it be  
One thing but the womens is trying to get to me  
I went down to the station  
Suitcase in my hand  
All the women run cryin'  
Mr. Jack, won't you be my man?  
Well there was three women  
Yellow, brown and black  
Take the mayor of Detroit to pick which one I like  
One of 'em Amtrak yellow  
One of 'em Detroit brown  
But that southwest dark skin sure to turn my damper down  
Why, ticket agent ticket agent  
Where did my baby go  
Tell me what she looks like  
I'll tell you what road she's on  
Well she's a long tall mama  
A mile and a half from the ground  
She's a tailor-man mama  
And she ain't no hand me down  
Well I used to say  
Married women  
Sweetest women never born  
You better change that thing  
You better leave married women alone  
Take my advice let married women  
Boy let 'em be  
Cause their husband will grab ya  
Beat your ragged ass to cedar street  
I got two women  
You can't tell 'em apart  
I got one in my bosom  
And the other is in my heart  
Well that one in my bosom  
She live in Tennessee  
Well that one in my heart  
She don't give a darn for me  
I'm gonna tell you pretty mama  
Exactly who I am  
When I walk in that front door  
And hear that back door slam

Now Mary  
Can't you find a way  
To bring me down?  
  
I'm so sorry  
That I had to go  
And let you down  
  
Knowing you I'll think  
Things are gonna be fine  
But then again you'll  
Probably change your mind  
  
I'm sorry Mary but  
Being your mate  
Means trying to find something  
That you aren't going to hate  
  
What a season  
To be beautiful  
Without a reason  
  
Knowing you I'll think  
Things are gonna be fine  
But then again you'll  
Probably change your mind  
  
Mary  
Can't you find a way  
To bring me down?

Singing  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
  
Well, the hills are pretty and rollin'  
But the thorn is sharp and swollen  
And the man plays a beautiful whistle  
But he wears a prickly thistle  
  
Singing  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
  
The silver birches pierce through an icy fog  
Which covers the ground most daily  
And the angels which carry St. Andrew high  
Are singing a tune most gaily  
  
Singing  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
  
One sound can hold back a thousand hands  
When the pipe plays a tune forlorn  
And the thistle is a prickly flower  
Aye, but how it is sweetly worn  
  
Singing  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh  
Li de li de li oh oh  
Well, a li de li de li oh

Tuesday mornin' now  
I gotta have somewhere to go

Oh won't you wake up and come with me now  
I'm going to the pawn and loan  
Walkin' down thirty three  
Walkin' down thirty oh  
  
What am I supposed to think  
  
I love people like a brother now  
But I'm not gonna be their mother now  
What if someone walked up to me  
And  
Like and apple cut right through me  
I'm no just gonna stand their grinnin'  
Cause I'm not the one who's sinnin'  
Screwdriver  
  
Ooh ooh ooh ooh  
  
Now that you have heard my story now  
I got a little endin' to it now  
Whenever you go out alone  
Take a little dog a bone  
And think about your little sister  
And then you gotta drive it home  
Screwdriver  
  
I got a little feeling goin' now x11  
Now now

Well we're back in school again  
And I don't really know anyone  
I really want to be your friend  
Cause I don't really know anyone  
  
And the bus is pulling  
Up to your house  
I wish you could be sitting here  
Next to me  
  
I didn't see you at summer school  
But I saw you at the corner store  
And I don't want to break the rules  
Cause I've broken them all before  
  
But every time I see you  
I wonder why  
I don't break a couple rules  
So that you'll notice me  
  
Sister do you know my name?  
I've heard it before but I want you to know  
  
I got a funny feeling  
That it's gonna work out  
Cause now I see you sitting here  
Next to me

You're lookin' at me  
Nowhere to go  
What they're sayin'  
I just don't know  
A floor below me  
Ceiling above  
And I'm in the middle  
With nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Yeah  
Well lookin' at me  
Nowhere to go  
Know what they're sayin'  
I just [don't know?]  
A floor below me  
A ceiling up above  
And I'm in the middle  
With nobody to love  
Nobody to love  
Yeah, hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Some pretty mama she starts  
Breakin' down

Woo stop breakin' down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out  
Well it'll make you lose your mind  
  
You Saturday night women  
You love to  
Ape and crown

Reputation down

Woo stop breakin' down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust your brains out  
Well it'll make you lose your mind

The ninety-ninth degree  
Shed just love to throw a pistol  
Down on me  
Stop breakin' down  
Hey stop breakin'down  
The stuff I got is gonna bust you brains out  
Well it'll make you lose your mind

There's a story  
I would like to tell  
My problem is  
Its one you know too well  
Its one you know too well  
  
Miss Suzy lee  
The one I'm speaking of  
The question is  
Is she the one I love?  
Is she the one I love?  
Alright  
Is she the one I love?  
Is she the one I love?  
  
She sent me flowers  
With her tears burned inside  
And you know what I'd do?  
I would run and hide  
I would run and hide  
  
And the paper  
On it was my name  
With the question  
Do you feel the same?  
Do you feel the same  
Alright  
  
To end this tale  
The one I'm speaking of  
I wish I had an answer but I just don't know  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?  
Is this really love?

We started living in an old house  
My ma gave birth and we were checking it out  
It was a baby boy  
So we bought him a toy  
It was a ray gun  
And it was 1981  
  
We named him 'Baby'  
He had a tootache  
He started crying  
It sounded like an earthquake  
It didn't last long  
Because I stopped it  
I grabbed a rag doll  
And stuck some little pins in it  
  
Now we're a family  
And we're alright now  
We got money and a little place  
To fight now  
We don't know you  
And we don't owe you  
But if you see us around  
I got something else to show you  
  
Well it's easy when you don't know better  
You think it's sleazy?  
Then put it in a short letter  
We keep warm  
But there's just something wrong  
When you  
Just feel like you're the hardest button to button  
  
I had opinions  
That didn't matter  
I had a brain  
That felt like pancake batter  
I got a backyard  
With nothing in it  
Except a stick  
A dog  
And a box with something in it  
  
The hardest button to button

You fell down of course  
And then you got up of course  
And started over  
Forgot my name of course  
Then you started to remember  
Pretty tough to think about  
The beginning of December  
Pretty tough to think about  
Pretty tough to think about  
Yeah, yeah, pretty tough to think about  
  
You're looking down again  
And then you look me over  
We're laying down again  
On a blanket in the clover  
The same boy you've always known  
Well I guess I haven't grown  
The same boy you've always known  
Same boy you've always known  
  
Think of what the past did  
It could've lasted  
So put it in your basket  
I hope you know a strong man  
Who can lend you a hand  
Lowering my casket  
  
I thought this is just today  
And soon you'd been returning  
The coldest blue ocean water  
Cannot stop my heart and mind from burning  
Everyone who's in the know, says  
That's exactly how it goes  
And if there's anything good about me  
I'm the only one who knows

It can't be love  
For there is no true love  
It can't be love  
For there is no true love  
  
Sure I'm C.F.K.  
But you gotta love me  
The cost no man can say  
But you gotta love me  
  
Well I'm sorry but I'm not  
Interested in gold mines,  
Oil wells, shipping or real estate  
What would I liked to have been?  
Everything you hate  
  
'Cause it can't be love  
For there is no true love  
It can't be love  
For there is no true love  
  
There is a man  
A certain man  
And for the poor you may be sure  
That he'll do all he can  
Who is this one?  
Whose favorite son?  
Just by his action has the traction  
Magnets on the run  
Who likes to smoke?  
Enjoys a joke?  
And wouldn't get a bit  
Upset if he were really broke?  
With wealth and fame  
He's still the same  
I'll bet you five you're not alive  
If you don't know his name  
  
You said the union forever  
You said the union forever  
You cried the union forever  
But that was untrue girl  
  
'Cause it can't be love  
For there is no true love  
It can't be love  
For there is no true love

My baby's got a heart of stone  
Can't you people just leave her alone  
She never did nothing to hurt you  
So just leave her alone  
  
The motion of her tiny hands  
And the quiver of her bones below  
Are the signs of a girl alone  
And tell you everything  
You need to know  
  
I can't explain it  
I feel it often  
Every time I see her face  
But the way you treat her  
Fills me with rage and I  
Want to tear apart the place  
  
You try to tell her what to do  
And all she does is stare at you  
Her stare is louder than your voice  
Because truth doesn't make a noise

And if I'm wasting my time  
Then nothing could be better  
Than hangin' on the line  
And waiting for a honest word forever  
  
And if you're saying goodbye  
Please don't you think me better  
For recalling every rhyme  
From the book the page  
The line the word the letter  
  
Well the windows turning blue  
And the waters ever flowing  
And I hope I'm not a fool  
For laughing at myself  
As you were going

Somebody's screaming  
Looking at the ceiling  
Everything's so funny  
I don't have any money  
People don't even know me  
But they know how to show me  
  
Why can't you be nicer to me?  
  
My pride is dying  
I think I'm all done lying  
Nobody's sharing  
So I stop caring  
All alone and walking  
Nobody's talking  
  
Why can't you be nicer to me?  
  
Well the wind is blowing  
Where am I going  
Off a bridge and falling  
Nobody's calling  
On the ground and laying  
Nobody's praying  
  
Why can't you be nicer to me?

In some respects I suspect  
You've got a respectable side  
When pushed and pulled and pressured  
You seldom run and hide  
But it's for someone else?s benefit  
Not for what you wanna do  
Until I realize that you've realized  
I'm gonna say these words to you  
Yeah, you don't know what love is  
You do as you're told  
Just as a child at ten might act  
But you're far too old  
You're not hopeless or helpless  
And I hate to sound cold  
But you don't know what love is  
You just do as you're told  
I can see your man can't help but win  
Any problems that may arise  
But in his mind there can be no sin  
If you never criticize  
You just keep on repeating  
All those empty I love you's  
Until you say you deserve better  
I'm gonna lay right into you  
Yeah, you don't know what love is  
You just do as you're told  
Just as a child at ten might act  
But you're far too old  
you're not hopeless or helpless  
And I hate to sound cold  
But you don't know what love is  
No, you don't know what love is  
No, you don't know what love is  
You just do as you're told  
Yeah, you do as you're told, yeah  

Lookie here momma let me explain ya this

Ya might read from revelation back to genesis  
Ya keep forgettin' your southern can belongs to me  
  
So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine in the mornin'  
Your southern can belongs to me  
  
Ya might go uptown have me arrested, put in jail  
Some hotshots got money gonna pull my bail  
Soon as I get out, hit the ground  
Your southern can is worth a thousand,  
Half a pound  
  
So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine, talkin' about it  
Your southern can belongs to me  
  
Ya might take it from the south, baby,  
Hide it up North  
Understand ya can't rule me and be my boss  
Take it from the East and hide in the West  
But when I get ya momma you can'll see no rest  
  
So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine, I'm screamin'  
Your southern can belongs to me  
  
Now baby, ashes to ashes, sand to sand  
When I hit ya momma then ya feel my hand  
Give ya a punch through that barbed wire fence  
When I hit ya baby, ya know I make no sense  
  
So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine, I know it  
Your southern can belongs to me  
  
Now look here woman, don't get hot  
I'm gettin' me a brick outta my backyard  
  
So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine, I'm talkin' about it  
You southern can belongs to me  
  
Well if I catch you momma  
Down in the heart of town

And tear your can on down  
  
So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine, I know it  
Your southern can belongs to me

So there ain't no use in bringin' no jive to me  
Your southern can is mine, I'm screamin'  
Your southern can belongs to me

You've got her in your pocket  
And there is no way out now  
Put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause it's home sweet home  
  
Nobody ever told you that it was the wrong way  
To trick a woman, make her feel she did it her way  
And you'll be there if she ever feels blue  
And you'll be there when she finds someone new  
What to do  
Well you know  
  
You keep her in your pocket  
Where there's no way out now  
Put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause it's home sweet home  
  
The smile on your face made her  
Think  
She had the right one  
Then she thought she was sure  
By the way you two could have fun  
But now you're scared  
You think she's running away  
You search in you hand for something clever to say  
Don't go away  
Cause I want  
  
To keep you in my pocket  
Where there's no way out now  
Put it in the safe and lock it  
Cause it's home sweet home  
  
And in your own mind  
You know you're lucky just to know her  
And in the beginning all you wanted  
Was to show her  
But now she might leave  
Like she's threatened before  
Grab hold of her fast  
Before her feet leave the floor  
And she's out the door  
Cause you want  
  
To keep her in your pocket
