When you're weary  
Feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes  
I will dry them all  
  
I'm on your side  
When times get rough  
And friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
When you're down and out  
When you're on the street  
When evening falls so hard  
I will comfort you  
  
I'll take your part  
When darkness comes  
And pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
See how they shine  
If you need a friend  
I'm sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Ease your mind!

Close every door to me,  
Hide all the world from me  
Bar all the windows  
And shut out the light  
Do what you want with me,  
Hate me and laugh at me  
Darken my daytime  
And toture my night  
  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Just give me a number  
Instead of my name  
Forget all about me  
And let me decay  
I do not matter,  
I'm only one person  
Destroy me completely  
Then throw me away  
  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Close every door to me,  
Keep those I love from me  
Children of Israel  
Are never alone  
  
For we know we shall find  
Our own peace of mind  
For I have been promised  
A land of  
A land of our own!  
  
If my life were important I  
Would ask will I live or die  
But I know the answers lie  
Far from this world  
  
Close every door  
Close every door to me

If ever I would leave you, it wouldn't be in summer.  
Seeing you in summer I never would go.  
Your hair streaked with sun-light, your lips red as flame, your face with a
luster.  
That puts gold to shame.  
  
But if I'd ever leave you, it couldn't be in autumn.  
How I'd leave in autumn I never will know.  
I've seen how you sparkle, when fall nips the air.  
I know you in autumn, and I must be there.  
  
And could I leave you running merrily through the snow  
Or on a wintry evening when you catch the fire's glow  
  
If ever I would leave you, how could it be in spring-time  
Knowing how in spring I'm bewitched by you so  
Oh, no! not in spring-time.  
Summer, winter or fall.  
No, never could I leave you at all.  
  
No, never could I leave you at all.

Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Hands and faces,  
Earth and sky,  
Love,  
Love changes everything:  
How you live and  
How you die  
  
Love  
Can make the summer fly,  
Or a night  
Seem like a lifetime.  
  
Yes, Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Now I tremble  
At your name.  
Nothing in the world will ever  
Be the same.  
  
Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Days are longer,  
Words mean more.  
Love,  
Love changes everything:  
Pain is deeper  
Than before.  
  
Love  
Will turn your world around,  
And that world  
Will last for ever.  
  
Yes, Love,  
Love changes everything,  
Brings you glory,  
Brings you shame.  
Nothing in the  
World will ever  
Be the same.  
  
Off  
Into the world we go,  
Planning futures,  
Shaping years.  
Love,  
Bursts in, and suddenly  
All our wisdom  
Disappears.  
  
Love  
Makes fools of everyone:  
All the rules  
We make are broken.  
Yes, Love,  
Love changes everyone.  
Live or perish  
In it's flame.  
Love will never,  
Never let you  
Be the same.  
  
Love will never,  
Never let you  
Be the same.

Mama thank you for who I am  
Thank you for all the things I'm not  
Forgive me for the words unsaid  
For the times  
  
I forgot  
Mama remember all my life  
You showed me love,you sacrificed  
Think of those young and early days  
  
How I've changed  
Along the way (along the way)  
  
And I know you believed  
And I know you had dreams  
And I'm sorry it took all this time to see  
That I am where I am because of your truth  
And I miss you , I miss you  
  
Mama forgive the times you cried  
Forgive me for not making right  
All of the storms I may have caused  
And I've been wrong  
Dry your eyes (dry your eyes)  
  
Mama I hope this makes you smile  
I hope you're happy with my life  
At peace with every choice I made  
How I've changed  
  
Along the way  
And I know you believed in all of my dreams  
And I owe it all to you mama

And now, the end is here  
And so I face the final curtain  
My friend, I'll say it clear  
I'll state my case, of which I'm certain  
I've lived a life that's full  
I traveled each and ev'ry highway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Regrets, I've had a few  
But then again, too few to mention  
I did what I had to do and saw it through without exemption  
I planned each charted course, each careful step along the byway  
And more, much more than this, I did it my way  
  
Yes, there were times, I'm sure you knew  
When I bit off more than I could chew  
But through it all, when there was doubt  
I ate it up and spit it out  
I faced it all and I stood tall and did it my way  
  
I've loved, I've laughed and cried  
I've had my fill, my share of losing  
And now, as tears subside, I find it all so amusing  
To think I did all that  
And may I say, not in a shy way,  
"Oh, no, oh, no, not me, I did it my way"  
  
For what is a man, what has he got?  
If not himself, then he has naught  
To say the things he truly feels and not the words of one who kneels  
The record shows I took the blows and did it my way!  
  
[instrumental]  
  
Yes, it was my way

She  
May be the face I can't forget  
A trace of pleasure or regret  
May be my treasure or the price I have to pay  
She may be the song that summer sings  
May be the chill that autumn brings  
May be a hundred different things  
Within the measure of a day  
  
She  
May be the beauty or the beast  
May be the famine or the feast  
May turn each day into a heaven or a hell  
She may be the mirror of my dreams  
A smile reflected in a stream  
She may not be what she may seem  
Inside her shell  
  
She who always seems so happy in a crowd  
Whose eyes can be so private and so proud  
No one's allowed to see them when they cry  
She may be the love that cannot hope to last  
May come to me from shadows of the past  
That I'll remember till the day I die  
  
She  
May be the reason I survive  
The why and wherefore I'm alive  
The one I'll care for through the rough and ready years  
Me I'll take her laughter and her tears  
And make them all my souvenirs  
For where she goes I've got to be  
The meaning of my life is  
  
She, she, she

Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin Mother and Child  
Holy Infant, so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace [x2]  
  
Silent night, holy night!  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia!  
Christ, the Saviour is born [x2]  
  
Silent night, holy night  
Son of God, love's pure light  
Radiant beams from Thy holy face  
With the dawn of redeeming grace  
Jesus, Lord, at Thy birth [x2]

Some enchanted evening  
You may see a stranger, you may see a stranger  
Across a crowded room, and somehow you know,  
You know even then  
That somewhere you'll see her again and again  
  
Some enchanted evening, someone may be laughing  
You may hear her laughing  
Across a crowded room and night after night, as strange as it seems  
The sound of her laughter will sing in your dreams  
  
Who can explain it?  
Who can tell you why?  
Fools give you reasons, wise men never try  
  
Some enchanted evening  
When you find your true love  
When you feel her call you  
Across a crowded room  
Then fly to her side, and make her your own  
Or all through your life you may dream all alone  
  
Once you have found her never let her go  
Once you have found her never let her go

There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Peace and quiet and open air  
Wait for us somewhere  
  
There's a time for us  
Some day a time for us  
Time together and time to spare  
Time to learn, time to care  
  
Some day, somewhere  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
There's a place for us  
Somewhere a place for us  
Time together and time to spare  
Time to learn, time to care  
  
Some day, somewhere  
We'll find a new way of living  
We'll find a way of forgiving  
Somewhere  
  
Hold my hand and I'll take you there  
Somehow, some day  
Somewhere

I'll protect you from the hooded claw  
Keep the vampires from your door  
  
Feels like fire  
I'm so in love with you  
Dreams are like angels  
They keep bad at bay-bad at bay  
Love is the light  
Scaring darkness away-yeah  
  
I'm so in love with you  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
The power of love  
A force from above  
Cleaning my soul  
Flame on burn desire  
Love with tongues of fire  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
I'll protect you from the hooded claw  
Keep the vampires from your door  
When the chips are down I'll be around  
With my undying, death-defying  
Love for you  
  
Envy will hurt itself  
Let yourself be beautiful  
Sparkling love, flowers  
And pearls and pretty girls  
Love is like an energy  
Rushin' rushin' inside of me  
  
The power of love  
A force from above  
Cleaning my soul  
Flame on burn desire  
Love with tongues of fire  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
This time we go sublime  
Lovers entwine-divine divine  
Love is danger, love is pleasure  
Love is pure-the only treasure  
  
I'm so in love with you  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
The power of love  
A force from above  
Cleaning my soul  
The power of love  
A force from above  
A sky-scraping dove  
  
Flame on burn desire  
Love with tongues of fire  
Burns the soul  
Make love your goal  
  
I'll protect you from the hooded claw  
Keep the vampires from your door
