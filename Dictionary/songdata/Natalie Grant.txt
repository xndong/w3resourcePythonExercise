Strong on the outside,  
But coming apart at the seams, that's me  
Tragically always together,  
But bruised underneath, that's me  
  
I stand just to stumble,  
Tripping on my pride,  
Why do I always try to hide  
  
Meanwhile, back at my heart,  
I'm desperate for all that you are,  
Undo me, take me apart  
  
Meanwhile, back at my soul,  
Mend me Lord, please make me whole,  
You know just where to start,  
Back at my heart, back at my heart  
  
Patiently waiting to pick up the pieces of me, that's you,  
Healer of hearts, when the world leaves it broken in two, that's you,  
  
Maker of Heaven, sky and the sea,  
You stretched you reached for me, you reached for me  
  
Meanwhile, back at my heart,  
I'm desperate for all that you are,  
Undo me, take me apart  
  
Meanwhile, back at my soul,  
Mend me Lord, please make me whole,  
You know just where to start,  
  
Back at my heart, back at my fear,  
Back at my brokenness, Lord meet me here,  
No one's opposed, I'm not afraid anymore.  
  
I'm desperate for all that you are,  
Undo me, take me apart  
  
Meanwhile back at my soul,  
Mend me Lord, please make me whole,  
You know just where to start,  
Back at my heart  
  
Back at my heart, back at my heart, back at my heart,  
  
Healer of hearts when the world leaves it broken in two, that's you

We don't feel ready  
We don't feel steady  
Question what we really have to give  
Stay where it's safer  
Claim faith, but waiver  
Is this how we really meant to live?  
  
We pray but never move  
We say but never do  
  
It's time to get our hands dirty  
Be love there's a whole lot of hurting  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands  
Calling all feet to take a stand  
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
  
A little somethin'  
Might feel like nothin'  
But in His hands it's all we'll ever need  
To speak life to the broken  
Watch the blind eyes open  
It's who He's calling you and me  
To be  
  
It's time to get our hands dirty  
Be love there's a whole lot of hurting  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands  
Calling all feet to take a stand  
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
  
We can be the change, be the hope  
We can be the arms that don't let go  
We can be a light in the dark  
We are, we are where it starts  
  
It's time  
Be love there's a whole lot of hurting  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands  
Calling all feet to take a stand  
Why sit around and wait for a miracle to come  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
When we can be one  
We can be the change, be the hope  
Yeah  
We can be the arms that don't let go  
Calling all hearts  
Calling all hands

Because of love he left his throne  
And made this earth his home  
He did it willingly  
For you and me  
With heaven left behind  
He came to save all mankind  
From sin and shame  
He could have walked away  
But instead he chose  
To stay upon that tree  
And take a crown of thorns for me  
Because of love  
Because of love he bore my pain (bore my pain)  
Shouldering the blame  
Why did he chose to go (he didn't have to go, no)  
How could he love me so?  
Because of love he called to me  
He said child I will set you free  
Youll have life abundantly  
Because of love (because of love)  
He gave unselfishly  
Caused my blinded to eyes to see  
It was you and me he had in mind  
On the road to Calvary  
I never known such a perfect love  
I had fallen down but he picked me up  
He rescued my soul  
Now I want the world to know  
Because of love he left the grave  
Prepared for us a place  
Hell back again someday  
And I will hear him say  
Because you believed  
Youll live eternally  
And I'll fall on my knees  
And I will cry  
You are holy, holy, lord god almighty  
You are worthy, to receive glory  
Honor and power forever  
Holy, holy, lord god Almighty  
You are worthy  
To receive glory  
Honor and power forever  
Amen, A-amen, oh A-amen  
Amen  
Holy, holy, holy  
Holy, holy, holy  
Holy, holy, holy  
Jesus you are  
The angels bow down and say  
Holy, holy, holy  
All creation cries out  
Holy, holy, holy  
Youre worthy of all the glory  
Forever  
Amen

I hear you say that you can't go on  
'Cause you had it all and watched it fall away  
You feel betrayed 'cause everything's gone wrong  
Can't find the strength to hope for a better day  
  
We may not understand the reasons  
But I know His promise will never change  
  
He's gonna take your pain  
He's gonna take your doubt  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together  
  
Gonna make you happy  
He's gonna make you laugh out loud, yeah  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together for good  
  
You say, you're living your life, doing the best you can  
Wondering if the struggle means anything  
If you realized that it's in His hands  
You'll find the peace that sweet surrender brings  
  
Well, we may not understand the reasons  
But I know His promise will never change  
  
He's gonna take your pain  
He's gonna take your doubt  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together  
  
Gonna make you happy  
He's gonna make you laugh out loud  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together for good  
  
I know there will come a day of healing  
Oh, we will see the master plan  
We will celebrate His faithfulness  
And we'll sing and we'll shout, praise His name  
  
He's gonna take your pain  
He's gonna take your doubt  
He's gonna bring it all together  
Bring it all together  
  
Gonna make you happy  
He's gonna make you laugh out loud

He's gonna bring it together  
He's gonna bring it together for your good

Lately I don't recognize you  
The fire in your eyes is fading into embers  
So while you're out there in the darkness  
I'm praying you'll remember  
  
You were made to shine  
You were made for life  
Even if you've lost your way  
Turn and you will hear love say  
You were made for more  
So much more  
Child of everlasting light  
Made to blaze away the night  
So baby, burn bright  
Burn bright  
  
You can rise up from the ashes  
Make something beautiful  
Of all the broken pieces  
And I'm believing you'll come running  
Into the arms of Jesus  
  
You were made to shine  
You were made for life  
Even if you've lost your way  
Turn and you will hear love say  
You were made for more  
So much more  
Child of everlasting light  
Made to blaze away the night  
So baby, burn bright  
Burn bright  
  
There will always be somebody in the dark  
Ready to rain down on your last spark  
Trying to blow out your flame again  
They will do it if you let them  
Oh, so don't you let them  
  
You were made to shine  
You were made for life  
Even if you've lost your way  
Turn and you will hear love say  
You were made for more  
So much more  
Child of everlasting light  
Made to blaze away the night  
So baby, burn bright  
Burn bright  
  
Yeah  
Burn bright  
Yeah  
Burn bright  
  
I'm believing you'll come running  
Into the arms of Jesus

It must mean something  
When I close my eyes  
Visions of you come to me and flood my mind  
It must mean something  
When my heart is true  
All that I can think about is you  
  
[Chorus]  
Everywhere I go you find me  
Even when I run  
I'm captured  
I'm captured in you  
Everywhere your love surrounds me  
I cannot escape  
I'm captured  
I'm captured  
  
It must mean something  
When I'm standing still  
Yours is the only voice I wanna hear  
It must mean something  
That I've come this far  
Lifting up my hands and offering my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You are the sky  
You are the sea  
You are the air I wanna breathe  
You're everywhere  
Your love last forever  
And if I fall  
You won't let go  
You hold me when I can't hold on anymore  
You reach out and rescue me  
  
[Chorus]

For those who seek the face of God  
For those who call the name of Christ  
The road upon this earthly sod  
Will one day lead to Paradise  
We embrace the cross of Calvary  
Pressing toward the prize we will receive  
[chorus]  
We're waiting on new wings  
Searching an old sky  
Waiting for the day, we see Heaven coming down  
There's a Promiseland awaiting  
But, there's mercy in the meantime  
While we're walking on this ground  
Between crosses and crowns  
We stumble and we lose our way  
We question what we're doing here  
Yet all the time we watch and pray  
We're wondering if the end is near  
So He left us His amazing grace  
Until we see Him face to face  
[chorus]  
We're pilgrims on a mission field  
Where the heart gets changed  
And the soul gets healed  
There's a purpose in these shadowlands  
Between the crowns of gold  
And the nail-scarred hands  
[chorus]

Rolled out of bed on the right side  
Looking up at the big blue sky  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
Who I am is what I am  
A piece in a part of a bigger plan  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
  
Breathe deep  
Taste the moment  
Few and far between  
  
[Chorus]  
Days like these-they don't get any better  
Let this be for always and forever  
Every minute is so perfectly  
Just the way that it was meant to be  
Days like these-so graceful that I'm falling  
On my knees and thanking God for all the  
Little things that make me wanna say  
How I wish I had a million days like these  
  
Life is running like a dream  
I know I can do anything  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
Days like this I could believe  
The sun is shining just for me  
Oh yeah-oh yeah  
  
Eyes closed  
Touch the freedom  
Never let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's as if I never knew that clouds existed  
If there ever was a day to take a chance I'll risk it

So many voices calling out to me  
To sell me something, tell me what I need, But they don't know about the
treasure I've found, A gift from heaven I can't live without  
It's a kingdom and it's hidden deep inside, I will be living for much more
than meets the eye  
-CHORUS-  
'Cause I need the deeper life, where the love of God runs far and wide, I need
the deeper life, I will give him all my heart and mind, I won't be swept away
by every changing tide  
I believe in the deeper life  
I got my telephone, Got my radio  
I got a lotta places I can go  
But where I want to be is off the deep end, My Jesus meets me when I dive
right in  
Don't want to slip slide on the surface of this life, My soul will search
untilthis thirst is satisfied  
[ -CHORUS-]  
I will be seeking first the kingdom of my God, I want everything he's got  
[-CHORUS-]

"Lord, Please guide my steps.  
I commit my way to You.  
I wont make a move, until I hear Your voice! "  
  
Don't wanna make a move!  
  
I gotta be on guard cause,  
Who knows what's in the shadows,  
To try and keep me off of this road,  
And lead me astray.  
I want every step to be in the right place  
At the right time!  
So I'm searching for You Lord,  
To guide me every day!  
  
I don't wanna make a move with the faith!  
Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth.  
In the twist and turns along the way,  
I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You!  
  
You got me when I woke up today,  
I was turning through the pages.  
Looking for some Wisdom that might show me  
Where You lead.  
Nothing short of You will satisfy my hunger!  
You can hear me crying out every night,  
From down on my knees!  
  
I don't wanna make a move with the faith!  
Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth.  
In the twist and turns along the way,  
I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You!  
  
In the still and quiet,  
I bow my heart,  
Incline my ear.  
Anything You whisper Lord,  
I want to hear!  
Lord I need to hear You!  
  
I don't wanna make a move with the faith!  
Don't wanna make a move without the light of truth.  
In the twist and turns along the way,  
I don't, I don't wanna make a move without You!  
  
I will follow You,  
Gonna do what You tell me to!  
I need You,  
I will follow you Jesus!

I am here alone, in the falling snow,  
And the wind, it cools my tears.  
I have been so wrong,  
I have turned away, but the road was long,  
And finally I have come to my knees,  
I want to be  
  
Where I can walk,  
Where I can run,  
Where my heart sings,  
And I feel the sun,  
Where I can trust,  
And I'm strong enough,  
Free like the wind,  
I'll run into my Father's arms,  
I'm finally home!  
  
Oh the winds of change,  
They blow slow and cool!  
Oh the wandering of a fool,  
But I have laid it down,  
In my Father's hands,  
Where the weight of suffering,  
Is carried by the arms of a cross,  
Healing my loss  
  
Where I can walk,  
Where I can run,  
Where my heart sings,  
And I feel the sun,  
Where I can trust,  
And I'm strong enough,  
Free like the wind,  
I'll run into my Father's arms  
  
Heaven has reached into my lonely soul.  
Loving so deep, and so complete,  
'Til I don't feel alone.  
Where the light of love is burning,  
Where the past is washed away,  
Where I feel the sunlight shining on my face!  
Now I can  
  
Walk!  
Now I can run,  
Now my heart sings,  
And I feel the sun,  
Now I can trust,  
And I'm strong enough,  
Free like the wind,  
I'll run into my Father's arms,  
I'm finally home!  
  
Now I can trust,  
And I'm strong enough,  
Free like the wind I run,  
Into my Father's arms  
I'm finally home

I think about all the time I wasted  
Trying to figure out  
What in the world my heart could ever trust  
What I finally found  
There ain't nothing on this earth  
Was ever gonna satisfy me, oh  
I think about all the life I've tasted now  
What I'd done without  
And sometimes I still wonder how  
You turned my heart around  
How You brought light into the world  
Love into my longing life, alright  
Well, down here  
I find my hope when I'm looking for You  
Well, things are looking up now  
Set my mind on things above  
I prefer the wonder of  
Your amazing grace, Your higher way, Your mystery  
Won't rely on earthly things  
Only want the love You bring  
'Cause I hope in the Heavenly  
I think about all the time I wasted here  
All that I dreamed about  
And in pursuit of happiness I fear  
I let some people down  
So Lord, I pray that they see through me  
See You on the other side  
Well, down here  
I find my hope when I'm trusting in You  
Well, things are looking up now  
Set my mind on things above  
I prefer the wonder of  
Your amazing grace, Your higher way, Your mystery  
Won't rely on earthly things  
Only want the love You bring  
'Cause I hope in the Heavenly  
Down here, I find my life in You  
My heart is complete  
For You're all the hope I need in this world  
And You're the love I lean into  
Yeah things are looking up  
Things are looking up now  
Set my mind on things above  
I prefer the wonder of  
Your amazing grace, Your higher way, Your mystery  
Won't rely on earthly things  
Only want the love You bring  
'Cause I hope in the Heavenly  
Set my mind on things above

Your amazing grace, Your higher way, Your mystery  
Won't rely on earthly things

Pretty princess, broken crown (yeah)  
And your dreams have all burned out  
But don't you know that they brought you  
Here somehow, all you need to know is  
  
You're home, where secrets are told  
See a new world unfolding  
Where hearts are one, the pain's undone  
And your finally belonging, yeah  
And you need to know, you need to know  
You're home, yeah  
You need to know, you need to know  
You're home  
So take your coat off and stay awhile (yeah)  
What made you cry can make you smile again  
You can hold your head up high  
Cause don't you know that you  
Oh, girl you were born to fly  
When you realize  
You're home, where secrets are told  
See a new world unfolding  
Where hearts are one, the pain's undone  
And your finally belonging, yeah  
And you need to know, you need to know  
You're home, yeah  
You need to know  
All you really need to know is you're home  
Welcome home  
Everything's gonna be alright  
Cause you're home  
Feel the sun, your day has come  
You're not alone  
You're home

You're spinning out of control again  
Your life feels like a sinking ship  
You're wondering how it came to this  
  
Is it too late?  
Is it too far?  
For Him to reach you  
And come to where you are  
  
Step out on the edge  
Don't be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
You're in the wreckage underneath  
Your hope is buried somewhere deep  
You're wondering how long it will keep?  
  
It's never too late  
Never too far  
For you to reach out  
And take a hold of love  
  
Step out on the edge  
Don't be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
Don't back down from the fight  
He'll shelter you tonight  
Just hold on for the change  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
There's a place, there's a place you can run  
When you fall, and it's all come undone  
You'll be safe in the raging storm  
So just let go  
'Cause you are held in His arms  
  
Step out on the edge  
Don't be afraid of it  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in the hurricane  
  
Oh oh  
  
And when you feel the rain  
Call His name  
He'll find you in a hurricane

You're here  
In my heart  
You're the light  
That guides me through the dark  
  
You walk beside me  
The night seems cold  
Each time I fall  
Your arms are there to hold  
  
[Chorus]  
You walk beside me  
Giving strength I've never known  
I am not alone  
You walk beside me  
  
You're here  
In my mind  
I talk to you  
And all my fears unwind  
I know I'm loved for who I am  
You make me wanna be the best I can  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I rely on your patience  
When I face the unknown  
And because of you  
I am not alone  
  
In the sun, in the rain  
Through the good times and the pain  
I reach out for your hand  
I know that you understand  
  
[Chorus]

Here in this world that you've designed  
From the rolling plains to the oceans  
Deep and wide  
Where are the words that can say what's  
In my heart  
All that I am is amazed by who you are  
  
[Chorus]  
The one thing I desire  
Is just to know you more  
To live a life that moves and breathes  
And loves to bring you joy  
So fill me with a fire  
That burns away my doubts and all my fears  
Into a place where you are all I hear  
It's the one thing I desire  
To do what you require  
Is the one thing I desire  
  
To love when I'd rather turn away  
To give when I'm more resigned to take  
To reach out a hand to someone who  
Feels alone  
The way you reached for me  
When there seemed to be no hope  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll live my life serving Christ  
Offering a sacrifice of praise  
  
[Chorus]

Holy One,  
Father of the Earth,  
Create in me a pure heart,  
So I can come in Spirit and in Truth  
To worship You,  
That's what I long to do.  
I love to Praise,  
I love to lift Your Holy Name!  
From the rising of the sun,  
And going down of the same!  
Your name is great!  
I will bless You all my days!  
Cause I love to Praise!  
Righteous One,  
Lover of my soul.  
Age to age, forever still the same.  
Your name is like the sweetest melody!  
Here with You is where I long to be.  
I love to Praise,  
I love to lift Your Holy Name!  
From the rising of the sun,  
And going down of the same!  
Your name is great!  
I will bless You all my days!  
Cause I love to Praise!  
You are Holy,  
My lips shall always speak Your praise.  
You are Worthy!  
Forever I will always sing Your praise!  
I love to Praise,  
I love to lift Your Holy Name!  
From the rising of the sun,  
And going down of the same!  
Your name is great!  
I will bless You all my days!  
Cause I love to Praise!  
  

One heart, one voice, living out love in this world of noise  
My dream and my joy, giving you all, I have made a choice  
Desperately I'm waiting to answer to your calling  
I will be a candle in the darkness  
I will be the hand of heaven above  
I will be a mirror that reflects your endless love  
I will be the hope among the hopeless  
Where there is conflict, I will be peace  
Only by the power of your spirit that's living in me, I will be  
Your heart, your plan, give me your eyes, help me understand  
My feet, my hands, holding out, living hope to every man  
Knowing what you've made me with every single heartbeat  
Gracious, gentle and kind  
Knowing that your love will shine through mine  
Gracious, gentle and kind  
Knowing that your love will shine through mine  
[Unverified]  
This little light of mine, I'm gonna let it shine  
This little light of mine, yeah  

I have been a wayward child,  
I have acted out,  
I have questioned sovereignty,  
And had my share of doubts,  
  
And though sometimes,  
My prayers feel like they're bouncing off the sky,  
The hand that holds won't let me go,  
And is the reason why  
  
I will stumble, I will fall down  
But I will not be moved  
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
I will not be moved  
  
Bitterness has plagued my heart,  
Many times before,  
My life has been a broken glass,  
That I have kept restored,  
Of all my shattered dreams,  
And though it seemed,  
  
That I was far too gone,  
My brokenness helped me to see,  
It's grace I'm standing on.  
  
I will stumble, I will fall down  
But I will not be moved  
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
I will not be moved  
  
And chaos in my life,  
Has been a badge of war,  
And though I have been torn,  
I will not be moved  
  
I will make mistakes, I will face heartache,  
But I will not be moved  
  
On Christ the solid rock I stand,  
All other ground is sinking sand,  
I will not be moved

All around us these days,  
There are souls that cry so deeply,  
To fill the emptiness we feel inside.  
We look around so hard to try and find,  
The kind of love we know that will survive.  
But here within a heartbeat,  
Is a love that so completely,  
Will take away the fear we try to hide,  
And even though we often wonder why,  
He gives us love so strong we can't deny.  
  
If the world lost all it's love,  
He would still have some to give you!  
And if the stars should lose their light,  
We'd still have His to hold back the night!  
This hope is mine,  
If the world lost all it's love,  
His still would shine!  
  
Hearts in need of kindness,  
Often stumble into blindness,  
When the dream world and the real world pull apart.  
It leaves us with a cold and empty heart.  
You'd think that we would know right from the start.  
  
If the world lost all it's love,  
He would still have some to give you!  
And if the stars should lose their light,  
We'd still have His to hold back the night!  
This hope is mine,  
If the world lost all it's love,  
His still would shine!  
  
Lost inside the hearts we hide,  
There's hope that He will take us in.  
To take away the suffering,  
And let new life begin.  
  
If the world lost all it's love,  
He would still have some to give you!  
And if the stars should lose their light,  
We'd still have His to hold back the night!  
This hope is mine,  
If the world lost all it's love,  
His still would shine!

It's hard to stand on shifting sand  
It's hard to shine in the shadows of the night  
You can't be free if you don't reach for help  
You cant love if you don't love yourself  
  
There is hope when my faith runs out  
'Cause I'm in better hands now  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down  
It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground  
So take this heart of mine there's no doubt  
I'm in better hands now  
  
I am strong all because of you  
I stand in awe of every mountain that you move  
Oh I am changed, yesterday is gone  
I am safe from this moment on  
  
There's no fear when the night comes 'round  
I'm in better hands now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's like the sun is shining when the rain is pouring down  
It's like my soul is flying though my feet are on the ground  
Its like the world is silent though I know it isn't true  
Its like the breath of Jesus is right here in this room  
  
So take this heart of mine there's no doubt  
I'm in better hands now  
I'm in better hands now

In Christ alone my hope is found  
He is my light, my strength, my song  
This Cornerstone, this solid ground  
Firm through the fiercest drought and storm  
What heights of love, what depths of peace  
When fears are stilled, when strivings cease  
My Comforter, my All in All  
Here in the love of Christ I stand  
  
In Christ alone, who took on flesh  
Fullness of God in helpless babe  
This gift of love and righteousness  
Scorned by the ones He came to save  
'Til on that cross as Jesus died  
The wrath of God was satisfied  
For every sin on Him was laid  
Here in the death of Christ I live  
  
There in the ground His body lay  
Light of the world by darkness slain  
Then bursting forth in glorious Day  
Up from the grave He rose again  
And as He stands in victory  
Sin's curse has lost its grip on me  
For I am His and He is mine  
Bought with the precious blood of Christ  
  
No guilt in life, no fear in death  
This is the power of Christ in me  
From life's first cry to final breath  
Jesus commands my destiny  
No power of hell, no scheme of man  
Can ever pluck me from His hand  
Till He returns or calls me home  
Here in the power of Christ I'll stand

Can't catch a break  
You've had your fill of old cliches  
Like 'life is hard, but God is good'.  
  
But even though it's true  
It won't stop what you're goin' through  
I wish that I could say it would.  
  
That he's outside of what you feel  
It might not make sense  
But one day it will.  
  
There's comin' a day the sun will always shine  
He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes.  
Hold on, my brother  
Things are gonna get better  
You're gonna smile again  
'Cause we win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
You're standing still  
Life has handed you a bitter pill  
Once again you're on your face  
  
You've got questions  
Plenty of secret confessions  
Wonderin' if you've run out of grace  
  
But he's outside of what you feel  
This life is just a moment  
But our forever is sealed  
Oh yeah  
  
There's comin' a day the sun will always shine  
He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes.  
Hold on, my brother  
Things are gonna get better  
You're gonna smile again  
'Cause we win in the end  
  
It won't be about  
Streets of Gold, Pearly Gates  
Harps or wings, Diamond Lakes  
All I know is that He's gonna hold you, hold me  
  
Heartache will disappear  
Questions will become clear  
Life will all make sense  
In the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
We win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
Oh yeah  
There's comin a day the sun will always shine  
He's gonna wipe away every tear from your eyes  
Hold on my brother  
Things are gonna get better  
You're gonna smile again  
Cos we win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
We win in the end  
  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
Oh - oh - oh - oh - oh - oh  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
We win in the end  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
Glorly Glory Hallelujah  
We win in the end  
  
We win in the end

I don't have to fully know  
Just how far Your love can go  
To sing of Your love for me  
I don't have to comprehend  
How Your mercy never ends  
To sing of Your mercy  
And all I need is  
All I really need is  
Just a glimpse of You  
And I'm in awe  
Just a glimpse of You  
My God  
Just a glimpse of You  
And all I can do is worship  
All I can do is worship You Lord, yeah  
And I don't have to clearly see  
How amazing grace can be  
To sing of Your grace for me  
And I don't have to fully grasp  
The measure of Your holiness  
Oh, to sing holy holy, holy holy  
And all I need is  
All I really need is  
Just a glimpse of You  
And I'm in awe  
Just a glimpse of You  
My God  
Just a glimpse of You  
And all I can do is worship  
I worship You  
I worship You  
I worship You  
Just a glimpse of You  
And I stand in awe  
Just a glimpse of You  
You take my breathe away  
My God  
Just a glimpse of You  
And all I can do is worship  
Just a glimpse of You  
And I'm in awe  
Just a glimpse of You  
My God  
Just a glimpse of You  
And all I can do is worship  
Just a glimpse of You  
And I'm in awe  
Just a glimpse of You  
My God  
Just a glimpse of You  
And all I can do is worship  
All go ahead and worship him tonight  
We worship You  
We lift up our voices in praise  
And thanksgiving Lord  
We worship You  
I worship You, yeah, yeah, yeah  
We worship You Lord  
In spirit and truth  
We worship You  
We stand in child like amazement  
Oh, with our eyes wide open  
We worship You  
With our hands stretched wide  
We worship You  
With our hearts wide open Lord  
We worship You  

He will be there  
Through the hurricane  
Through the pouring rain  
He will be there  
  
Through the longest night  
Everything's gonna be alright  
The storm is gonna end  
And the sun's gonna rise again  
  
[Chorus]  
Keep on shining  
Let Love light up the darkest sky  
And you'll be flying  
Rise above all the hardest times  
So hold on (Hold on)  
Be strong (Be strong)  
Come on (Come on, come on)  
Keep on shining  
  
Nothing can stop  
The way He feels  
'Cause His Love's so real  
No mountain top  
  
Will ever be too high  
'Cause with Jesus by your side  
There's nothing you can't do  
You're gonna make it through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know in your soul  
You know in your heart  
He will always be your only  
Guiding star  
  
[Chorus]

Sittin' in my room staring at the wall  
Wonderin' about the meaning of it all  
Why is it this thing called life  
Has got me goin' crazy  
So I open up your word and let it speak to me  
The purpose and the plan that you've designed  
Is clear to see, and I believe  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm gonna live for today  
I'm gonna follow in your way  
I'm gonna let my little light shine  
Like there's no tomorrow  
I won't worry about the past

So I'll choose to live my life one way  
I'm gonna live it for today  
  
You told me not to worry  
About what lies ahead  
So I am gonna focus on today instead  
Making every moment count and counting  
Every single blessing  
I'm gonna set my mind on the  
Here and the now  
This is what I want my life to be about  
And this is how  
  
[Chorus]

See the faces in the crowd  
Everyone is reaching out  
Searching for something that's real  
  
See the souls behind the eyse  
Left with no way to disguise  
The yearning inside  
  
[Chorus]  
He loves without limits  
Sees us every minute  
Wherever we are walking  
He is near  
His spirit is relentless  
His hope for us is endless  
I know, I know  
He loves without limits  
  
There's no mountain that's too steep  
There's no ocean that's too deep  
Nothing can keep him from us  
  
He's the lover of our souls  
He's the one that makes us whole  
Oh, don't you know  
If we could only see how far  
God will reach to touch our hearts  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know, I know nothing can separate us  
I know, I know God's love is limitless  
  
[Chorus]

She was only 17  
Wild at heart and following her dreams  
Believing she was pretty  
Got a ticket to the city  
Where she'd find her place on the cover of a magazine  
  
It was only a chat room, but it would lead the way  
To the door of a man where she'd throw it all away  
He said they'd take it slow  
But little did she know  
She'd be all used up by the end of the day  
  
But she was strong  
And she would survive  
Ambition would be her drive  
And she said...  
  
I'll make a way  
I'll do whatever it takes  
Even though it won't be easy  
I have a plan and though I may not understand  
Someday, I'll make a way  
  
Where did she go wrong, how did she get here?  
Livin' hard and looking older than her years  
Miss Little Big Town  
Trying to hold a job down  
Doing what she could to choke her fears  
  
But she was strong  
And she would survive  
A spark of hope had kept her dream alive  
And she cried...  
  
I'll make a way  
I'll do whatever it takes  
Even though it won't be easy  
I have a plan and though I may not understand  
Someday, I'll make a way  
Someday, I'll make a way  
  
Walking down the road  
In the city where she'd come with so much hope  
Her vision had long died  
Along with all her pride  
And she found herself at the end of her rope  
  
But she heard angels through the door  
Of a church she'd passed a million times before  
There was a song of heaven ringing  
And soon she found herself believing  
That out there maybe there was something more  
  
So she bowed her head to pray  
And said, Jesus, please make a way  
  
And she heard Him say...  
  
I'll make a way  
I'll do whatever it takes  
Even though it won't be easy  
I have a plan and though you may not understand  
Today, I'll make a way  
  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Today He'll make a way

Pack my bags and my regrets,  
Every moment that I've wasted,  
Chasing after my pursuit of happiness,  
Has only left me searching,  
There must be more,  
  
Take my life,  
And lift me up to the sky,  
Take my dreams,  
And help me to fly,  
On the wing of the stability,  
Come re-write the history,  
To which only you are chasing after,  
Take this life and make it matter,  
  
Help me give more than I take,  
And let me see into somebody else's heartache,  
And be the difference love can make,  
My heart is finding out, there's gotta be more  
  
Take my life,  
And lift me up to the sky,  
Take my dreams,  
And help me to fly,  
On the wing of the stability,  
Come re-write the history,  
To which only you are chasing after,  
Take this life and make it matter,  
  
Only one life to live,  
Only one love to give,  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
So make it matter  
  
Only one life to live,  
Only one love to give,  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
So make it matter  
  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
Here's my life,  
Take it, make it matter,  
  
Pack my bags, and my regrets...  
  
Take my life,  
And lift me up to the sky,  
Take my dreams,  
And help me to fly,  
On the wing of the stability,  
Come re-write the history,  
To which only you are chasing after,  
Take this life and make it matter,  
  
Make it, make it, matter,  
  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
Only one life,  
Only one love,  
Make it matter,  
Make it matter

I've been silent instead of speaking up  
Gave my advice instead of giving love  
I have been unfair, faithless and unkind  
I have shut my eyes just so I would stay blind  
It's not what I meant to do  
Cause I wanna honor you  
Make me over, make me new  
Make me a mirror, a reflection of you  
Take me all apart  
Take me to your heart and pull me closer  
Oh, Jesus, make me over  
Take away the pride that whispers in the dark  
Take the stone out of the middle of my heart  
Hidden underneath my insecurities  
Is the servant that you've destined me to be  
But day after precious day  
I get in my own way  
Make me over, make me new  
Make me a mirror, a reflection of you  
Take me all apart  
Take me to your heart and pull me closer  
Sweet savior, make me over  
I am only made of your imagining  
I'm dust and clay on the wind  
Wash me in the river of your sacrifice  
Until I'm changed, purified  
Take me all apart  
Take me to your heart and pull me closer  
My Jesus, make me over  
Make me over

It's a long wait at the gate  
Just to glimpse your fate  
Just to see whether it all works out  
It's a long road, a heavy load  
You gotta really want to go  
And just let the others walk around  
You now  
  
Up and down again  
But this time it's different  
It took some waiting to straighten  
Out the bend  
In and out of luck  
Yeah at times it was difficult  
I got a new life baby, It takes some getting used to but...  
  
Chorus:  
No sign of any rain  
My skies are clear today  
I keep bracing for that hit  
But there's not sign of it.  
No obstacles in sight  
My skies are clear tonight (My skies are full of light)  
I keep thinking I might see that cloud arrive  
Oh but there's no sign of it  
No sign of it  
  
And as I look around, it's all new ground  
The leaves on the trees touch down  
But I'm above weightless as a dream  
It's been a long road, a heavy load  
I just simply had to go  
Had to get here hard as it's been  
  
In and out of luck  
Yeah at times it was difficult  
I got a new life baby, it takes some getting  
Used to but...  
  
Repeat Chorus

A seed, it grows and somehow becomes a life  
It moves, she knows that her Baby has arrived  
She's so scared, but she's so blessed  
She lays down her fear for the hope at her breast for she knows  
  
One million chains could never hold back this moment in time  
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means  
Heaven and earth, they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night  
For it only takes one Child to forever change the world  
  
He stands beside her, he'd share her pain if he only knew how  
He whispers, "I love you" as he gently strokes her brow  
He's so scared, but he's so blessed  
There's a thundering pride pounding deep in his chest  
For he knows  
  
One million chains could never hold back this moment in time  
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means  
Heaven and earth, they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night  
For it only takes one Child to forever change the world  
  
Christ is born, we are blessed  
Every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess  
That we know  
  
One million chains could never hold back this moment in time  
One thousand dreams could never dream what this moment truly means  
Heaven and earth, they cradle the Infinite Joy born on this night  
For it only takes one Child, whoa  
This is the one Child  
  
This Baby cries and for the first time  
The world hears the voice of God weep  
Mary sings a lullaby  
As the Hope of the nations gently falls asleep  
She knows this is the one Child  
To forever change the world  
This is my Jesus

You would think only so much can go wrong  
Calamity only strikes once  
And you assume that this one has suffered her share  
Life will be kinder from here  
  
Sometimes the sun stays hidden for years  
Sometimes the sky rains night after night  
When will it clear  
But our hope endures the worst of conditions  
It's more than our optimism  
Let the earth quake  
Our hope is unchanged  
  
How do we comprehend peace within pain  
Our joy at a good man's wake  
Walk a mile with a woman whose body is torn  
With illness but she marches on  
  
Sometimes the sun stays hidden for years  
Sometimes the sky rains night after night  
When will it clear  
  
But our hope endures the worst of conditions  
It's more than our optimism  
Let the earth quake  
Our hope is unchanged  
  
Emanuel, God is with us  
El Shaddai, all sufficient  
Emanuel, God is with us  
El Shaddai, all sufficient  
Emanuel, God is with us  
El Shaddai, all sufficient  
  
We never walk alone  
This is our hope  
Our hope endures, the worst of conditions  
It's more than our optimism  
Let the earth quake  
Let the earth quake  
Let the earth quake  
Our hope is unchanged

Never let him see you when your breaking  
Never let him see you when you fall  
That's how we live  
And that's how we try  
  
Tell The world you've got it all together  
You never let him see whats underneath  
We cover it up  
With the crooked smile  
But it only lasts for a little while  
  
There's no such thing as perfect people  
There no such thing as a perfect life  
So come as you are, broken and scarred  
Lift up your heart and be amazed, and be changed  
By a perfect God  
Yea  
  
Suddenly its like a weight is lifted  
When you hear the words that you are loved  
He knows where you are  
And where you've been  
And you never have to go there again  
  
There's no such thing as perfect people  
There's no such thing as a perfect life  
So come as you are, broken and scarred  
Lift up your heart and be amazed and be changed  
By a perfect God  
  
Who lived, and died, to give you life  
To heal our imperfections  
So look up, and see love, and let grace be enough  
  
There no such thing as perfect people  
Yea  
There's no such thing as a perfect life  
So come as you are, broken and scarred  
Lift up your heart and be amazed and be changed  
By a perfect God  
By a perfect God  
By a perfect God  
Yea  
By a perfect God  
Be changed by a perfect God  
Be changed

My Jesus, my Savior  
Lord, there is none like You  
All of my days I want to praise  
The wonders of Your mighty love  
  
My comfort, my shelter  
Tower of refuge and strength  
Let every breath, all that I am  
Never cease to worship You  
  
Shout to the Lord, all the earth, let us sing  
Power and majesty, praise to the King  
Mountains bow down and the seas will roar  
At the sound of Your name  
I sing for joy at the work of Your hands  
Forever I'll love You, forever I'll stand  
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You  
  
My Jesus, my Savior

Nothing compares to the promise I have in You  
Nothing compares to the promise I have  
Nothing compares to the promise I have in You

Mystified by the struggle  
To survive my own pride  
Haunted by the demons  
Of my past life  
Who am I and why do I  
Are questions that keep running  
Through my mind  
But underneath this shallow skin  
A brand new me is comin' out,  
Comin' out from within  
  
[Chorus]  
So long  
Farewell to my old self  
Good-bye to the lie that I can't be someone else  
Cause who I was ain't who I am  
(I know that) I've been born again  
Those stains of my history are gone, gone, gone  
So long  
  
Apathy, hunting me  
Like some contagious disease  
Hypocrisy hiding in the shadows  
Of the former me  
Doin' what comes naturally  
I'm not who I want to be  
I'm ready to, ready to be free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Hey, hey, hey  
So long  
  
Na-na-na, na-na-na-na  
Hey, hey, hey  
So long  
  
[Chorus]

This is a song for anyone whose ever been  
Knocked down and can't get back again  
Stuck in the corner, can't move forward  
All alone and you think you're going nowhere  
This is a song for anyone whose ever stood underneath the sun  
And felt so small, two feet tall and so out of place  
  
He sees yo, He knows you, He loves you  
And He wants you to know that  
  
The life that you've been living, the days that you've been given  
Were made for something beautiful  
Life - don't let it pass you by  
Because you were created for something beautiful  
  
Heaven holds a dream that's just for you  
And there are things only you can do  
So step by faith, put the past away so step by faith, don't be afraid  
It'll take you to a better day put the past and your fears away  
Second to minute to hour to life  
Time always seems to fly  
It's on the go and before you know  
Your days are through  
  
But he sees you, He knows you, He loves you  
And he wants you to know that  
  
The life that you've been living, the days that you've been given  
Were made for something beautiful  
Life don't let it pass you by  
Because you were created for something beautiful  
  
What are you waiting for  
What are you waiting for  
What are you waiting for  
There's something beautiful

You came to the world  
For love of one like me  
And though I am the worst  
Of sinners grace is all I see  
  
Freedom from those chains  
My brokenness redeemed  
Love and mercy flowing  
Down to life eternally  
  
How could I repay such a debt  
Except with my life?  
How could I give anything  
But sacrifice, sacrifice of praise?  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
  
In plenty and in want  
Your strength is all I need  
And deep within these shadow lies  
Your glory never leaves  
  
How could I repay such a debt  
Except with my life?  
And how could I give anything  
But sacrifice, sacrifice of praise?  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on  
  
Oh my praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
My praise will go on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on and on  
And on and on and on and on  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
To the King eternal immortal  
Be all the glory forever, amen  
  
I give in all of me  
This is my offering

No heartbeat is always steady  
Angels have halos already  
Please- don't think you're proving  
Yourself all the time  
I don't need you to be perfect  
I know the wait will be worth it  
You and me baby we're only just  
Learning to shine  
  
You should know  
This my love  
How far I'll go  
Here's when I'll give up  
  
Chorus:  
When the sun is coming up at midnight  
When the clocks have all run out of time  
When the snow- falls in june  
That's when I'll give up (on loving you)  
When the earth is finished spinning around  
When it's raining up instead of down  
When a dream-can't come true  
When the rivers all run out of blue  
That's when I'll give up (on loving you)  
  
You'll never run out of chances  
I don't need you to have all the answers  
Love isn't something that has to be  
Put to the test  
  
Love like this  
Can't be undone  
I'm telling you  
If the day should come  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
As you're walking through the world  
You gotta know  
I'll be with you everywhere you go  
You can spread your wings or run  
Back to my arms  
I will always hold you in my heart- baby  
  
You'll always be  
A part of me  
Baby can't you see  
  
Repeat Chorus

(Verse 1)  
It's always been a mystery to me  
How two hearts can come together  
And love can last forever  
But now that I have found you, I believe  
That a miracle has come  
When God sends the perfect one  
Now gone are all my questions about why  
And I've never been so sure of anything in my life  
  
(Chorus)  
I wonder what God was thinking  
When He created you  
I wonder if He knew everything I would need  
Because He made all my dreams come true  
When God made you  
He must have been thinking about me  
  
(Verse 2)  
I promise that wherever you may go  
Wherever life may lead you  
With all my heart I'll be there too  
From this moment I want you to know  
I'll let nothing come between us  
And I will love the ones you love  
Now gone are all my question about why  
And I've never been so sure of anything in my life  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Bridge)  
He made the sun He made the moon  
To harmonize in perfect tune  
One can't move without the other  
They just have to be together  
And that is why I know it's true  
You're for me and I'm for you  
Cause my world just can't be right  
Without you in my life  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
(Tag)  
He mustve heard every prayer I've been praying  
Yes He knew everything I would need  
When God made you  
When dreams come true  
When God made you  
He mustve been thinking about me

I've waited all this time  
Counting minutes as they passed  
Searching for a sign  
Wishing for the best  
And just when I thought my chance was gone  
You came to me with open arms  
  
Like a miracle out of the blue  
You rescued me when I turned to You  
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies  
When You walked, when You walked into my life  
  
When You appeared  
Like sight to the blind  
Like music to my ears  
Like a reason to a rhyme  
Just when my hope was wearing thin  
You taught my heart to love again  
  
Like a miracle out of the blue  
You rescued me when I turned to You  
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies  
When You walked, when You walked into my life  
  
You spoke my name and the Word began again  
You touched my heart and it opened  
  
Like a miracle out of the blue  
You rescued me when I turned to You  
You shook the heavens and cracked the skies  
When You walked, when You walked into my life

Heey, ooh, ooh  
I know that life seems hard, cruel and unkind  
A lonesome journey with questions in your mind  
I'll hold your weary hand as you walk down the road  
Remember you're never alone, no  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever you want someone  
To reach out and touch you  
With a love that is strong  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever you want a friend  
To chase away the clouds and help the sun shine again  
I will be that friend  
  
If I could have one wish this I would pray  
A heavenly miracle, your pain to drift away  
So I'll keep on prayin' until that day comes  
Remember that I'll be the one, the one  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'll give you strength in times you're feeling weak  
I'll give you hope and help you to believe  
Yeah  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm gonna be a friend  
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'm gonna be that friend  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Right by your side  
I'm gonna be that friend  
Ooh, oooh

When I feel the worlds against me  
Left me in the cold  
Thinking I've been forgotten  
Out there on my own  
I close my eyes and in the silence  
Hear a voice so clear  
Reminding me your love  
Is always right here  
Within me-then all of my doubts disappear  
And there's nothing to fear- your loves  
Within me  
You gave me strength to believe  
That all that I am and all that I'll ever need is  
Within me  
When my spirit's all but broken  
I'm humbled to the bone  
Searching for the grace  
To find my way home  
I take a breath, a slow deep breath  
And feel a sense of calm  
Then the hurt in my heart is suddenly gone  
Within me you wiped away all my tears  
There's nothing to fear- your love's within me  
It gives me the strength to believe  
That all that I am and all that I'll ever need is  
Within me

You are my strength when I am weak  
You are the treasure that I seek  
You are my all in all  
  
Seeking You as a precious jewel  
Lord, to give up I'd be a fool  
You are my all in all  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Oh, Your name is worthy  
  
Taking my sin, my cross, my shame  
Rising again I bless Your name  
(I bless Your name)  
You are my all in all  
(Oh yes you are, yes you are)  
  
When I fall down You pick me up  
When I am dry You fill my cup  
(You fill my cup)  
You are my all in all  
(My all, Lord, hallelujah)  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
(Oh, Your name, Your precious name is worthy, Lord)  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
  
You're my everything  
The beginning and the end  
The first, the last You are  
The great I am  
  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
Worthy is Your name  
Jesus, Lamb of God  
(Oh, my Jesus, my precious Jesus)  
Worthy is Your name  
  
Worthy is Your name  
Worthy is Your name

I stand in awe  
That You know my name  
Just a glimpse of Your love for me  
And now I am changed  
Because You showed me how  
To walk a different way  
I have peace like I've never known  
I am living  
You move me  
Lord, You move me  
There's a fire burning in my soul  
And it's flowing through me  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
You move me  
For too many years  
I have been color blind  
Only saw in shades of gray  
Stuck in black and white  
But by grace You opened my eyes  
Now I see the light  
And Your love has colored my world  
And makes my soul cry  
You move me  
Lord, You move me  
There's a fire burning in my soul  
And it's flowing through me  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
Lord, You move me  
Day after day I'm amazed  
That You gave Your life for me  
When I think of the price that You paid  
How can I not say?  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
There's a fire burning in my soul  
It's flowing through me  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
Lord, You move me  
Lord, You move me, yeah  
Now I must tell the world what I know  
You move me, yeah, yeah  
You move me  
You move me  
Yes, You do  
Oh, Your love amazes me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
You move me  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  

Nothing can separate  
Even if I ran away  
Your love never fails  
  
I know I still make mistakes  
But You have new mercies for me everyday  
Your love never fails  
  
You stay the same through the ages  
Your love never changes  
There maybe pain in the night  
But joy comes in the morning  
  
And when the oceans rage  
I don't have to be afraid  
Because I know that You love me  
Your love never fails  
  
The wind is strong and the water's deep  
But I'm not alone in these open seas  
'Cause Your love never fails  
  
The chasm is far too wide  
I never thought I'd reach the other side  
But Your love never fails  
You make all things work together for my good
