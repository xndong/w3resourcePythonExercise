You're rendering that scaffolding dangerous?  
  
Grass eyed,  
Slashed eyed,  
Brain dead fucker.  
Rips off town,  
Steals from his brother,  
Loathed by everyone  
But loved by his mother.  
  
It not the hip or the ship  
That gets you caught,  
No one likes to feel that they've been bought  
Why then?  
Should you do it again and again and again.  
  
He's a wise guy, when guy  
Don't like my eye spy  
Always a snipe try  
Never a green guy  
Loathed by everyone  
But loved by his mother  
  
Give you a calls  
For the  
Thing upstairs  
She brings him his night time brown and flask  
Sews up his nighttime brown and mask  
You bleed in my eye  
You bleed in my eye  
White track  
  
Grass sliding, slasher  
Brain dead fucker  
Rips of himself and steals from his brother  
Loathed by everyone  
But loved by his mother  
  
(kiss kiss)  
  
Why then should you do it again and again and again.  
Why then do you do it again and again and again.

We all lern to box from the Midget Club  
Where we punch with love and did somebody good  
It's good to see you to see you nice  
If you do me one, well we'll do you twice  
We're twice as likely we're twice as right  
Right  
Right on, right on  
Right  
Right on, right on  
We all learnt to wash at the scrubbers club  
Where we ring out the dirt with a rud a dub dub  
Tell how you think if you think it was good  
Say it loud and clear so it's understood  
You take it how you made it like I know you would  
Let it bled let it heal let me sleep it's no good, so  
Let's ride, right on right on

And if you didn't well you ought to do it now  
  
Well lets ride on ride on

Six cheap people in an empty hotel  
Every last one with a story to tell  
Give them all pills, so their heads won't swell  
We were borne to a woman whose husband did quite well  
  
Oh sunshine, shone brightly  
Through my window today  
Could have tripped out quite easy but i decided to stay  
Hold out your hand said whitey with the blame  
Gonna bring you up so you really dig the pain  
Take you under my wings so you'll never be the same  
'cause your wife is so much older and both her legs are lame  
A sunbeam shone brightly through my window today  
Could have gone 20 miles but i decided to stay  
  
All my flock has packed up and flocked back to hell  
Open up the windows so the place don't start to smell  
Carry on with what your doing 'cause you don't to it that well  
I've been umpteen different people and no one else can tell  
  
Sunshine shone brightly through my asshole today  
Could have tripped out quite easy but i decided to stay  
To stay a while  
Come up and see me make me smile  
Come up and see me make me smile

It took three million years Now its my turn to see it  
Ive got to go back I just don't believe it Do you love it?  
Oh I bet you do Do you need it?  
Well, I'm just like you Smiley bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay of its back on the bottom of the bottle  
It took three million years to meet Mr. Helpful  
But now that I've meet him I'm extremely doubtful  
  
Are you healthy? Well I just eat fruit  
But I tell you man It just don't suit  
You're the bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay on its back and talking pure twaddle  
Its my turn now and there's always a houseful  
And saying the right thing Its always a mouthful  
It took three million years to meet Mr. Moonlight  
To finally ask him To put everything right  
  
You're the big bug eyed mung worm at the bottom of the bottle  
Lay on its back and your talking pure twaddle  
To make you more smiley You drink olive oil  
It gives me pure headache When your cooking with foil  
Its my turn now And there's always a houseful  
And saying the right thing its always a mouthful

I can virtually do anything I read  
Someone somewhere swa between your knees  
Hand me out fish, did some big tease  
Oh man did you fuck it, Baby brother I took it  
Then I pilfered the bag and the amex gold  
Because the lord chief constable knows I'm Owen  
And everybody said I told you so

Me and the chief got slowly stoned

Cos me and all the rich got mobile homes, Holmes  
Me and all the rich got mobile phones, Bones  
  
God made it easy

Bring all the family out to the holiday  
While we're all still around  
Show you what the cats been doing, and how he gets around  
You can't wake him, he's not sleeping  
He never comes down  
Bring all the family out to the holiday  
While we're all still in town  
Show you what the cats been doing, and how he gets around  
Lady skin up, lady skin up  
Now that we live together we both get fucked up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's only grandbag that died  
He really couldn't see what you're doing  
And all his family were white

Fold them all up and put them all away  
Won't be no misfit in my household today  
Pick them all out and send them on their way  
Do what you're doing, say what you're saying  
Go where you're going, think what you're thinking  
Sounds good to me  
  
Don't know what you saw, but you know it's against the law  
And you know that you want some more  
I've heard it all before  
Gonna buy an airforce base  
Gonna wipe out your race  
Get stoned in a different place  
Don't you know I got better taste  
Do what you're doing, say what you're saying  
Go where you're going, think what you're thinking  
It sound good to me  
  
Do what you're doing, spend what you're owing  
Pay what you're paying, look where you're going  
Say what you're thinking, kill who you're killing  
Sing if you're singing, speak if you're speaking  
Sounds good to me

Its delicious the way your walking go easy on your toes  
There's a million and one different dances who do you know  
That knows there's a monkey in the family it was trained by Adam and eve it
was so  
  
Your great granddad and grandma and decided it wouldn't leave  
I had to make the grass more greener I had to make the sky more blue  
I had to put a stop to the jungle jive team so they don't do these with  
You when you grow up you'll moon stomp mi lady to moon stomp is in your blood  
You'll have to make a keen decision but you'll  
Know everything about love there's a monkey in the family swings  
Tree to tree it never stops to see how your doing  
It just has time to feed it's delightful  
The way your walking be steady on those feet stay away  
From the peppermint twist where the humpty humpey

In that perfect place  
In a dream of the place that you met  
And a lonely feel  
And a little emotion  
  
But all those childish things  
But all those childish things that you said  
When you were young in your head  
When you were in our bed  
  
And if you say that it's ok  
Then it's ok for you to do, now  
And if you say that it's all right  
Then it's all right for me  
  
And if you say that it's ok  
Then it's ok for me to do  
You know it must be all right  
You know it must be all right  
  
But you went too far  
And it's gone all the wrong way  
But you went too fast and now the only thing that you ever...  
Well it's not there  
It's all gone  
  
And if you say that it's ok  
Then it's ok for me to do now  
And if you say that it's all right  
Then it's all right for you  
  
And if you say that it's ok  
Then it's ok for us to do  
You know it must be all right  
You know it must be all right  
  
It's not unusual to be loved by anyone  
It's not unusual to be fucked by everybody  
It's not unusual to spend some time on yourself  
Gonna make it all right  
Say we'll make it all right  
  
It's all right!  
It's all right!  
  
Fuck

When he came out to the lock-up  
He said I'm looking for something better  
He made his shock announcement  
And backed off, backed down, backed off  
  
And then he got up off the floor  
He said I'm wealthy enough, not to do this no more  
And he made it all known with his hands held up, palm out  
  
And she said don't know if I should  
'Cause I worry too much about the tests on the blood  
And at first it was a 'yes', and then a 'no', then a 'yes'.  
  
A maggot sleeps on her desk  
H wears a sleeping bag as his vest  
And he's getting too too bothered  
About the spots on his chest, chest, chest  
  
Now TT, she laid it on  
And a few days later she's gone  
So it's back to the womb  
To get drowned, drowned, drowned, drowned warm (?)

That's sickly clean  
This mild and meek I could launch it with a poker  
No danger for a weekend It opens its mouth  
There's no words, just a squeak I could launch it with a poker  
No joker for a weekday  
Bing bong the weekday  
Bing bong no danger  
Here goes a sweet freak  
How many fools do you get in school  
In an English county classroom  
All the things going on inside your billbong  
There's no room its just pure art room  
You try very hard to get that right  
To imitate some kind of life form  
A matter of fact without and tact  
You can go on back you  
Shouldn't have been burn  
Diggers mothers switch on the cooker  
Get the hillbillies down  
Set out to bugger  
Sweet freak pen and ink  
  
How do you make a bulldog think  
Happy Christmas I said  
Not to speak then  
Happy Christmas whens its next week then  
And you swear you naughty meat head  
What sleeps in your bed Is got to be a Greek ted  
How many fools do you get in a school  
In an english county  
All the things going on inside your built bomb  
There's no room  
Its just pure art room  
Its dangerous to let the freaky dink in Chopper up, cooker,  
Give me some more smother  
I cant stand the thought of the dwarf bein a mother  
Is this love, man, its pure hate  
If you put it on the table  
It'll be to late  
Is this love, man  
No, its pure hate  
It cant be more simple  
Its there on a plate Is this love man  
No it ain't.

I wrote for luck  
They sent me you  
I sent for juice  
You give me poison  
I order a line  
You form a queue  
You try something hard  
There's nothing else you can do  
Well that much  
I've been trained  
I can sit and stand  
And beg and rollover  
And I don't read  
I just guess  
There's more than one sign  
But its getting less  
And you were wet  
But you're getting dryer  
You used to speak the truth  
But now you lair  
You used to speak the truth  
But now you clever  
  
And wrote for luck  
They sent me you  
I sent for juice  
You give me poison  
I order a line  
You form a queue  
Try something hard  
There's nothing else you can do  
And you were wet  
But you're getting dryer  
You used to speak the truth  
But now you clever  
You used to speak the truth  
But now you clever  
  
and when its hot  
You start to melt  
'cause you're not made of king  
You're made of chocolate  
And when it cold  
You turn to crack  
You keep on piling out  
Not pulling back
