Always the winner, baby  
You're always the center, baby  
But don't you ever get lonely at night  
When the clouds have gone away  
It's always  
You're showing her the lady  
Always the lady  
You're full of  
Yourself, you know  
Gone crazy  
There was a time when you cared for their hearts  
And the need to show them love was tearing you apart  
But you changed, you know  
Become the star of the show  
Now you've got nothing to give  
Where is the truth you once lived  
You're just lonely  
Don't you feel lonely  
Turn out the spotlight, I'm tired, turn out the spotlight  
My mind will die, lord, I'm crying  
Oh, I'm to turn my gaze back, lord, to you  
You're the only one who knows me  
Just mold me back to you  

"Take this man to prison," the man heard herod say,  
And then four squads of soldiers came and carried him away.  
Chained up between two watchmen, peter tried to sleep,  
But beyond the walls an endless prayer was lifting for his keep.  
Then a light cut through the darkness of a lonely prison cell,  
And the chains that bound the man of God just opened up and fell,  
And running to his people before the break of day,  
There was only one thing on his mind, only one thing to say:  
  
Angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angels watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
God only knows the times my life was threatened just today.  
A reckless car ran out of gas before it ran my way.  
Near misses all around me, accidents unknown,  
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home.  
But I know they're all around me all day and through the night.  
When the enemy is closing in, I know sometimes they fight  
To keep my fight from falling, I'll never turn away.  
If you're asking what's protecting me then you're gonna hear me say:  
  
Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angles watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me  
  
Angels watching over me  
Angels watching over me  
  
Got his angels watching over me, every move I make,  
Angels watching over me!  
Angels watching over me, every step I take,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
Angels watching over me,  
Angels watching over me,  
Angels watching over me,  
Angels watching over me!  
  
Though I never see with human eyes the hands that lead me home

Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go  
Anywhere He leads me in this world below  
Anywhere without Him dearest joy would fade  
Anywhere with Jesus I am not afraid  
  
[Chorus]  
Anywhere, anywhere ...any little fear I'll never know  
Anywhere with Jesus I can safely go  
  
Anywhere with Jesus, I am not alone  
Other friends may fail me, He is still my own  
Tho' His hand may lead me over dearest ways  
Anywhere with Jesus is a house of praise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Anywhere with Jesus I can go to sleep  
When the darkening shadows round about me creep  
Knowing I shall waken nevermore to roam  
Anywhere with Jesus will be home, sweet home  
  
[Chorus]

I see her as a little girl  
Hiding in her room  
She takes another bath  
And she sprays her mama's perfume  
To try to wipe away  
The scent he left behind  
But it haunts her mind  
  
You see, she's his little rag  
Nothing more than just a waif  
And he's mopping up his need  
She is tired and afraid  
Maybe she'll find a way  
Through these awful years  
To disappear  
  
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me if I think there's a God up in the Heaven  
I see no mercy, and no one down here's naming names  
Nobody's naming names  
  
Now, she's looking in the mirror  
At a lovely woman face  
No more frightened little girl  
Like she's gone without a trace  
Still she leaves the light  
Burning in the hall  
It's hard to sleep at all  
  
'Til she crawls up in her bed  
Acting quiet as a mouse  
Deep inside, she's listening  
For a creaking in the house  
But no one's left to harm her  
She's fin'ly safe and sound  
There's a peace she has found  
  
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask her how she knows there's a God up in the Heaven  
She said His mercy is bringing her life again  
She's coming to life again  
  
He's in the middle of her pain, in the middle of her shame  
Mercy brings life  
He's in the middle  
Mercy in the middle  
  
So ask me how I know  
Ask me how I know  
  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
She said His mercy is bringing her life again  
  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
Where did He go in the middle of her shame?  
Ask me how I know there's a God up in the Heaven  
She said His mercy is bringing her life again

I'm lookin' for a way to feel you hold me  
Feel your heartbeat just one more time  
Reaching back, trying to touch the moment  
Each precious moment that you were mine  
  
How do you prepare when you love someone this way  
To let them go a little more each day  
  
The stars we put in place  
The dreams we didn't waste  
The sorrows we embraced  
The world belonged to you and me  
The oceans that we crossed  
The innocense we lost  
The hurting at the end  
I'd go there again  
'Cause it was beautiful  
It was beautiful  
  
So this is missing you is overwhelming  
When it hits me  
You're not coming back  
And in my darkest hours I have wondered  
Was it worth it, for the time we had  
My thoughts begun to hear you  
But one thing I know is true  
I'll bless the day that I found you  
  
The stars we put in place  
The dreams we didn't waste  
The sorrows we embraced  
The world belonged to you and me  
The oceans that we crossed  
The innocence we lost  
The hurting at the end  
I'd go there again  
'Cause it was beautiful  
It was beautiful  
  
The rules we stepped aside  
The fear that we defied  
The thrill of the ride  
The fire in our hearts that burned  
The oceans that we crossed  
The innocence we lost  
The hurting at the end  
I'd go there again  
'Cause it was beautiful  
It was beautiful

Would you think that I was crazy if I said to you  
I know a way that love  
Can make your wildest dreams come true  
All you have to do is  
  
Believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your hear, the journey starts  
When you believe  
  
When you've had enough  
And giving up was all but got you down  
Sure could stand a helping hand  
Get your feet back on the ground, turn your world around  
  
Just believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your heart, the journey starts  
When you believe  
  
When your pride is trying to tell you  
To do it by yourself  
And you're running out of answers  
And you need a little help  
  
Believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your heart, the journey starts  
  
Believe, miracles can happen  
Just imagine and believe  
Open up your heart, the journey starts  
When you believe, just believe

We sowed our seeds  
Watered with tears  
Waiting for signs of growth  
Took months of days  
And then took years.  
  
We took our steps  
We took our falls  
Somewhere along the way  
We just got lost  
And we lost it all.  
  
But nothing ventured, nothing gained  
The risk of living is the pain  
And what will be will be anyway  
  
Oh, it's better not to know  
The way it's gonna go  
What will die and what will grow.  
Goodbye more than hello  
It's better not to know  
  
Those tiny stems became these trees  
With dirt and storm  
And sun and air to breathe  
Like you and me.  
  
And some fell down  
And some grew tall  
And those surviving twenty winter thaws  
Have the sweetest fruit of all.  
  
But innocence and planting day  
Are both long gone  
So much has changed  
And if we had to do it all again  
  
Oh, it's better not to know  
The way it's gonna go  
What will die and what will grow.  
Oh, nothing stays the same  
Life flickers like a flame,  
As the seasons come and go  
Goodbye more than hello  
It's better not to know  
  
Is it better, better not to know?  
Is it better, (is it better), is it better?  
  
We sowed our seeds  
Watered with tears  
  
Oh, it's better not to know  
The way it's gonna go  
What will die and what will grow.  
Oh, nothing stays the same  
Life flickers like a flame,  
As the seasons come and go  
Goodbye more than hello  
What comes of what we sow  
It's better not to know  
It's better not to know  
  
We sowed our seeds  
Watered with tears

God loves a lullaby  
In a mothers tears in the dead of night  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.  
God loves a drunkards cry,  
The soldiers plea not to let him die  
Better than a Hallelujah sometimes.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
The woman holding on for life,  
The dying man giving up the fight  
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes  
The tears of shame for what's been done,  
The silence when the words won't come  
Are better than a Hallelujah sometimes.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
Better than a church bell ringing,  
Better than a choir singing out, singing out.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
We pour out our miseries  
God just hears a melody  
Beautiful the mess we are  
The honest cries of breaking hearts  
Are better than a Hallelujah.  
  
(Better than a Hallelujah sometimes)  
Better than a Hallelujah  
(Better than a Hallelujah sometimes)

They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
With a pink hotel, a boutique, and a swinging hot spot  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop  
  
They took all the trees and put 'em in a tree museum  
And then they charged all the people twenty-five bucks just to see 'em  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop, shoo-bop-bop-bop  
  
Hey farmer, farmer, put away your DDT now  
Give me spots on my apples but leave me the birds and the bees, please  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
I say, they paved paradise and they put up a parking lot  
  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
  
Late last night I heard the screen door slam  
And a big yellow taxi carried off my old man  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and they put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got till it's gone  
They paved paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
  
Oh, now, they paved paradise and they put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop  
Hey, steam rolled paradise and put up a parking lot  
Shoo-bop-bop-bop-bop

When I think of all of the things He's doin' for me  
It makes me stand in wonder at what He's making me to be  
Tryin' to walk through straight but getting turned around  
Always makin' my Master take a backseat and wait around  
But I praise the Lord for giving me  
A brand new start each day  
And I praise His blessed name  
For guiding me all along the way  
If He didn't, I wouldn't even try  
Well maybe you can't see a change  
You know these things can take time  
But now that I've found Jesus  
Well He's given me peace of mind  
Now every day's just a chance  
To grow closer to Him  
I may not win all the battles  
But it's a victory in Him  
So I praise the Lord for giving me  
A brand new start each day  
And I praise His blessed name  
For guiding me all along the way  
If He didn't, I would surely die  

I have travelled many moonless night  
Cold and weary, with a babe inside  
And I wonder what I've done  
Holy Father, you have come  
And chosen me now  
To carry your son  
  
I am waiting in a silent prayer  
I am frightened by the load I bear  
In a world as cold as stone,  
Must I walk this path alone?  
Be with me now  
Be with me now  
  
[Chorus]  
Breath of heaven  
Hold me together  
Be forever near me  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Lighten my darkness  
Pour over me your holiness  
For you are holy  
  
Breath of heaven  
Do you wonder as you watch my face  
If a wiser one should have had my place  
But I offer all I am  
For the mercy of your plan  
Help me be strong  
Help me be  
Help me  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven  
Breath of heaven

I will wait for the bridegroom  
I've awakened early to say  
I will wait for my bridegroom  
I will wait for him today  
I will give to him my impatience  
I will give him all of my fear  
I will make my heart very quiet  
I will wait for him here  
In bright color, in joyous line  
In morning light and lamp fire  
I?ll make fine my home here  
And trust in my home to come  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
With loving care and with pleasure  
In the lamp light I will sing  
I will trust in my bridegroom  
I will give him everything  
In bright color and in joyous line  
In morning light and lamp fire  
I?ll make fine my home here  
And trust in my home to come  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
La la la, la la la la la  
La la la, la la la la  
In bright color and in joyous line  
In morning light and lamp fire  
I?ll make fine my home here  
And trust in my home to come  
I will give to him my impatience  
I will give him all of my fear  
I will make my heart very quiet  
I will wait for him here  
I will wait for the bridegroom  
I've awakened early to say  
I will wait for my bridegroom  
I will wait for him today  

[Chorus]  
Lay down your burden  
I will carry you  
I will carry you my child, my child  
Lay down your burden  
I will carry you  
I will carry you my child, my child  
  
Cause I can walk on water  
Calm a restless sea  
I've done a thousand things you've never done  
And I'm really watching  
While you struggle on your own  
Call my name, I'll come  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I give vision to the blind  
I can raise the dead  
I've seen the darker side of hell  
And I've returned  
I've seen those sleepless nights  
And count every tear you cry  
Some lessons hurt to learn  
  
[Chorus]

Every life, every beating heart  
Has a searching soul inside  
Ever needing, ever seeking out  
The meaning to life  
  
I refuse to believe that we're only here to live and die  
In the futile days of a faithless haze  
Never asking why, why would I  
When I've felt the hand of eternity  
It's a legacy I will leave, I want to leave  
  
For the chilrden of the world  
Every single little boy and girl  
Heaven plants a special seed  
And we must have faith for these  
  
I will stand for the truth I've seen  
So the truth is seen in me  
I will give from the source of love  
So all that I believe is handed down  
For the road that's yet to be travelled on  
By the ones who will carry on, I'll carry on  
  
[Chorus]  
For the chilrden of the world  
Every single little boy and girl  
Heaven plants a special seed  
And we must have faith for these  
Red and yellow, black and white  
They are precious in the father's eyes  
Like the father may we see  
That they have a destiny  
And give them the light of love to lead  
  
Through the darkness around us now  
To a place where hope is found  
  
[Chorus: x 3]  
  
For the children of the world

Praise to God whose love was shown  
Who sent his Son to earth  
Jesus left his rightful throne  
Became a man by birth  
  
The virgin's baby son  
All creation praised Him  
God incarnate come  
Come to Bethlehem  
  
Still a higher call had He  
Deliverance from our sins  
Come to set all people free  
From Satan's hold within  
  
For by the sin of man we fell  
By the Son of God  
He crushed the power of Hell  
Death we fear no more  
  
Now we stand with strength, with power  
The sons of God on earth  
Faithful to the final hour  
Christ's righteousness our worth  
  
And now all praise is given  
For the babe, the Son  
The Savior King is risen  
Christ is Lord indeed  
  
For the babe, the Son  
The Savior King is risen  
Christ is Lord indeed

Baby this life can break your heart  
Everyone hurts to some degree  
But while this world is fallin' apart  
Why don't you come be with me?  
Don't you know that night can be so cold  
When you're without the one you need?  
How much longer do I have to go  
Waiting for you? Come be with me  
Love can be so simple  
When you let it flow  
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart  
Send it from your soul  
Look up at the stars burnin' bright  
Listen to the wind whisper sweet  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
Why don't you come be with me?  
(Ooh ooh ooh)  
Love can be so simple  
When you let it flow  
Get it in your head, feel it with your heart  
Send it from your soul  
Look up at the stars burnin' bright  
Listen to the wind whisper sweet  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
(Know the moment's right)  
Why don't you come be with me?  
Heaven and Earth know the moment is right  
(Why?)  
Why don't you come be with me?  

Come, Thou Fount of every blessing  
Tune my heart to sing Thy grace  
Streams of mercy, never ceasing  
Call for songs of loudest praise  
Teach me, ever to adore Thee  
May I still Thine goodness prove  
While the hope of endless glory  
Fills my heart with joy and love  
Oh, to Grace, how great a debtor  
Daily I'm constrained to be  
Let Thy goodness like a fetter  
Bind my wandering heart to Thee  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee, God I love  
Here's my heart, take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above  
Never let me wander from Thee  
Never leave Thee, God I love  
Here's my heart, take and seal it  
Seal it for Thy courts above  

Who knew love would come walking through' my door  
Turn a light on somewhere down inside  
And give me a feeling I'd never had before  
It was a long wait  
It was just the wrong time  
  
But I hope you'll hold me now  
Somewhere within  
And when you think about  
What might have been  
  
[Chorus:]  
Cry a river  
Flood the sea  
Cry a river over me  
Take the bitter  
With the sweet  
And cry a river over me  
  
How can you argue with a feeling in your bones  
'Bout what is and what isn't meant to be  
Some things you live with  
But you never let it show  
Like the pain I felt  
The day I watched you leave  
  
But I hope you'll think of me  
When tender winds blow  
Sit on the shores of love  
And just let it go  
  
[Chorus:]

There was this guy, he was down on his luck  
He was truly poverty's child  
Well, he had no home and he had no car  
And he wore a weary smile  
Moved out to l.a., knocked around for awhile  
But he was getting nowhere  
Then he did this movie and it did really well  
Now he's a millionaire  
See, life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
I know a man who could paint the town red  
Had a college degree in fun  
'till the doorbell rang and a long lost flame said  
"this little boy is your son"  
Gave him a suitcase and a bear  
Left 'em in a cloud of dust  
Now he's checking out schools and driving carpools  
Learning to adjust  
He says life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Well, I know that it can be demanding  
I know that it can be unkind  
I don't really understand it  
But lord sure knows I try  
Life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
  
Let me tell you 'bout a kid I knew  
A pudgy girl back in school  
She had greasy hair and geeky glasses  
Object of ridicule  
The other day in the check out line  
They were ringing up my rice and beans  
There she was, a pretty little face  
On the cover of a magazine  
And I said life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing  
(chorus)  
  
Just goes to show that you never know  
Just what tomorrow may bring  
But I'll tell you this that what it is  
Is seldom what it seems  
'cause life is a curious thing  
Life, ooh life is a curious thing. . .

There's a place at the edge of the sky  
Where there's a love deep as it is wide  
The weak are strong, the hungry are all fed  
And there's a breeze from the angels flying overhead  
Oh yeah  
  
And there's a path, a glorious light  
That guides you up the mountainside  
And at the top, if you could you'd cry  
'Cause you see pure love for the very first time, mmm  
  
Deep as it is wide  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there  
I believe there's a love  
Deep as it is wide  
  
And I hear, when you get to the river  
You look back for the very last time  
And when you cross, you get washed off forever  
Hurry up boy, eternity's on the other side, ohh  
  
Deep as it is wide, yeah  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there  
I believe there's a love  
Deep as it is wide  
  
Every nation, color and creed  
Like grace pouring out, far as the eye can see  
Singing praises up to a King  
'Cause He died, for a crown  
Deep as it is wide, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
Every breath taking me closer  
Every step leading to paradise  
They say the faithful get to go there and  
I believe there's a love  
I believe in a love, oh yeah  
I believe there's a love  
Deep as it is wide, oh yeah, oh  
  
There's a place at the edge of the sky  
Where there's a love, deep as it is wide

Another Monday comes and I just wanna breathe  
'Cause it's a long, long week for someone wired to please  
I keep taking my aim, pushing it higher  
Wanna shine bright, even brighter now  
Wish I would tell myself  
  
Don't try so hard  
God gives you grace and you can't earn it  
Don't think that you're not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and He's not leaving  
Gave you His Son so you'd believe it  
You're lovely even with your scars  
Don't try so hard  
  
Do you remember how the summers felt when we were kids?  
Oh, we didn't think much about it, we just lived  
Taking our time, beautiful leisure  
When did we start, trying to measure up  
And all this time, love has been trying to tell us  
  
Don't try so hard  
God gives you grace and you can't earn it  
Don't think that you're not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and He's not leaving  
Gave you His Son so you'd believe it  
You're lovely even with your scars  
Don't try so hard  
  
Don't try so hard  
  
Don't try so hard  
God gives you grace  
You can't earn it  
Stop thinking you're not worth it  
Because you are  
He gave you His love and He's not leaving  
Gave you His Son so you'd believe it  
You're lovely even with your scars  
Lovely the way you are  
So open up your lovely heart  
Don't try so hard

If you see the moon  
Rising gently on your fields  
If the wind blows softly on your face  
If the sunset lingers  
While cathedral bells peal  
And the moon has risen to her place  
You can thank the father  
For the things that he has done  
And thank him for the things he's yet to do  
And if you find a love that's tender  
If you find someone who's true  
Then thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you  
And if you look in the mirror  
At the end of a hard day  
And you know in your heart you have not lied  
And if you gave love freely  
If you earned an honest wage  
And if you've got Jesus by your side  
You can thank the father  
For the things that he has done  
And thank him for the things he's yet to do  
And if you find a love that's tender  
If you find someone who's true  
Thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you  
You can thank the father  
For the things that he has done  
And thank him for the things he's yet to do  
If you find a love that's tender  
If you find someone who's true  
Thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you  
Thank the Lord  
He's been doubly good to you  

We dim the light.  
We stoke the fire.  
We breathe the evergreen.  
Young ones wait  
  
While the old ones make up  
Tales of how it used to be.  
China dolls,  
Candy corn,  
  
Painted wooden toys,  
Treasures found  
To the wondrous sound  
Of carolling the Savior  
  
Born to us on Christmas morn.  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
  
The son of Israel.  
And still he calls  
Through the night,  
Beyond the days of old.  
  
A voice of peace  
To the weary ones,  
Who struggle with the human soul.  
All of us,  
  
Travellers,  
Through a given time.  
Who can know  
What tomorrow holds?  
  
But over the horizon,  
Surely you and I will find.  
  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
Emmanuel!  
Emmanuel, God with us,  
  
The son of Israel.  
And the years they come,  
And the years they go,  
Though we may forget somehow  
  
That the child once born in Bethlehem  
Is still among us now.  
(Emmanuel....)  
(Emmanuel, God with us.  
The son of Israel.)  
  
Emmanuel, God with us, (Emmanuel.)  
Emmanuel! (Emmanuel.)  
Emmanuel, God with us, (Emmanuel.)  
  
The son of Israel. (Israel.)  
The son of Israel.  
The son of Is...Israel. (Son of Israel.)

There you go making mountains  
Out of such a little hill  
Here I go mixing mortar  
For another wall to build  
There's a struggle in this life we lead  
It's partly you  
It's partly me (but)  
Every road that's traveled  
Teaches something new  
Every road that's narrow  
Pushes us to choose  
And I'd be lying if I said  
I had not tried to leave a time or two  
But every road that leads me  
Leads me back to you  
Here we stand in the middle  
Of what we've come to know  
It's a dance, it's a balance  
Holding on and letting go  
But there is nothing that we can't resolve  
When love's at stake  
When love's involved

I was wasting time  
Oh so sure to find somebody  
Who'll never go  
How could I know  
None I'd found was true  
None could be but you  
The only one love divine  
My heart, my mind are yours  
  
[Chorus]  
Everywhere I go  
I see your face through the crowd  
Everywhere I go  
I hear your voice clear and loud  
Everywhere I go  
You are the light that I seek  
Everywhere I go  
You have found me  
  
Where could my heart go  
Where you wouldn't know to find me?  
Far, far from here  
Still you are near to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I have seen you in the evening  
In the morning light you hold me  
Closer than the air around me  
You surround me always  
  
Everywhere I go  
I see your face through the crowd  
I hear your voice clear and loud  
You are the light that I seek  
You have found me  
  
[Chorus: Repeat x3]

Well, I'd like to figure out where we stand Before darkness falls  
And I'd like to figure out Before too late  
Before hope is lost  
Cause the sun that's shining on my face  
Is shining down on you  
And the fruit that gives me strength to live  
Is giving you strength too  
  
Can we find a way to find a compromise  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
  
Well, I'd like to figure out a way  
To leave a troubled past behind  
To forget those angry words and wars we fought  
Across the battle lines  
Cause tomorrow we could find a road to peace  
For you and me  
And our children in their innocence  
Will follow what they see  
  
Oh, we've got to find a way to live our lives  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
  
Oh...how easy it would be  
To close the door and walk away  
I can't walk out when I believe  
You are my brother  
And we owe it to each other  
We've got to try  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
Oh...how easy it would be  
To close the door and walk away  
I can't walk out when I believe  
You are my brother  
And we owe it to each other  
We've got to try  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
  
Well, I'd like to find a way  
Tho' we don't see eye to eye  
Eye to eye  
  
Well, I'd like to figure out where we stand  
Before darkness falls...

Fairytale, my life was just a fairytale  
I was letting an illusion  
Come into this heart of mine  
Fairytale, searchin' for a fairytale  
Hiding in a world  
Where life was simple all the time  
I was just like Peter Pan in Never Never Land  
Afraid of what the future might be  
Afraid to face the things I couldn't understand  
Afraid of things that I couldn't see  
But fantasy, I know  
There's more to life than a fantasy  
There's so much more  
That my life was meant to be  
So much more than make-believe  
Fairytale, it seems just like fairytale  
But there's something in my hear  
That says this time the story's real  
Fairytale, extraordinary tale  
Of a King who offers love  
So far beyond what I can feel  
There's a world out there  
That human eyes can never see  
But it's just within the reach of the heart  
Two princes wages the battle for eternity  
But the Victor has been known from the start  
Now I can see the truth  
Can seem so much like a fantasy  
But make-believe was never as real to me  
I know this time the story's true  
Just like Sleeping Beauty in a Neverland  
I was dying under a spell  
But then a Prince who comes from the Foreverland  
Awakened me from my fairytale  

Faith-Walkin' People  
By Amy Grant  
Well, it seems with You  
There is something new  
Every time I turn around.  
Oh, I never really know quite what to expect,  
But it won't get me down.  
'Cause I know You bring  
Each and everything  
Just to teach me how to live.  
And the secret of it all is trusting in You,  
And the wisdom You give.  
So say goodbye to the feelings,  
'Cause the feelings go away.  
Say goodbye to the people,  
'Cause the people never stay.  
And say goodbye to the future,  
When it blinds you to today.  
And say goodbye to the reasoning  
That's standing in the way,  
Oh, we've got to break away.  
Break away to be  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't rely on everything you feel.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
We must discern what's really real.  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't believe in everything you see.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
Seems like such a mystery.  
Daaa...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba dah...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba lat-dah dat dah.  
But in all the earth  
There is nothing worth  
Half as much as life with You.  
'Cause the people and things we're countin' on here,  
They're gonna pass away too.  
But I don't understand  
Everything He's been,  
But I don't really have to know.  
'Cause He's giving me a joy that's filling my heart,  
But I've learned to let go.  
So say goodbye to the feelings,  
'Cause the feelings go away.  
Say goodbye to the people,  
'Cause the people never stay.  
And say goodbye to the future,  
When it blinds you to today.  
And say goodbye to the reasoning  
That's standing in the way,  
Oh, we've got to break away.  
Break away to be  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't rely on everything you feel.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
We must discern what's really real.  
Faith-walkin' people,  
You can't believe in everything you see.  
Faith-talkin' people,  
Seems like such a mystery.  
Daaa...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba dah...da ba da dah-dat dah.  
Da ba dat-dah dat dah.

At times the women deep inside me  
Wanders far from home.  
And in my mind I live a life  
That chills me to the bone.  
A heart running for arms out of reach.  
But who is the stranger my longing seeks?  
I don't know,  
But it scares me through and through.  
Cause' I've a man at home  
Who needs me to be true.  
  
Oh, faithless heart  
Be far away from me.  
Playin' games inside my head  
That no one else can see.  
Oh, faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core,  
But you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around anymore.  
  
God, you know the feelings here  
Can wipe my world away.  
Ravaging the promises  
A stronger heart once made.  
So hold me, I'm falling so fast.  
And tell me that the fighting inside will pass.  
As I walk away,  
And find the strength to choose  
The man who waits for me  
With a heart that's true.  
  
Oh, faithless heart  
Be far away from me.  
Playin' games inside my head  
That only I can see.  
Oh, faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core,  
But you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around anymore.  
  
Faithless heart  
  
Oh, faithless heart  
Be far away from me.  
Playin' games inside my head  
That nobody else can see.  
Oh, faithless heart  
You tempt me to the core,  
But you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around anymore.  
Oh, you can't have a hold on me  
So don't come around.

You know some days I like me, some days I don't  
Some days I try with passion, sometimes I won't.  
I might just hold my guard up, and lock my heart up tight  
But it's the door that's open letting in the light  
There's a battle raging inside of me  
It's a holy struggle, and it won't let go of me  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
I used to sit and ponder if I'd be fine  
If Jesus lived His own life and I lived mine  
But love is such a magnet, it pulled me night and day  
Until my needy heart just couldn't stay away  
Life can drive you crazy or just about  
But even when it's most frustrating, this kid's not walking out  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
Sure it's tough but I won't deny it  
No, no, no  
I don't want to waste my life hiding  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
I've made up my mind now, I don't want to lose out  
(Unguarded)  
Beginning to see now,What the fight is about  
(Unguarded heart)  
I gotta stay open, keep defenses all down  
(Unguarded)  
Don't want to be hiding when the love comes round  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
No, no, no  
I don't want to stop the fighting  
Wo, wo, wo  
Sure it's tough but I won't deny it  
No, no, no  
I don't want to waste my life hiding  
Wo, wo, wo  
I just want to live right  
...  

You tell me your friends are distant  
You tell my your man's untrue  
You tell me that you've been walked on  
And how you feel abused  
  
So you stand here an angry young woman  
Taking all the pain to heart  
I hear you saying you want to see changes  
But you don't know how to start  
  
Love will find a way (How do you know)  
Love will find a way (How can you see)  
I know it's hard to see the past and still believe  
Love is gonna find a way  
I know that  
Love will find a way (A way to go)  
Love can make a way (Only love can know)  
Leave behind the doubt  
Love's the only out  
Love will surely find a way  
  
I know this life is a strange thing  
I can't answer all the whys  
Tragedy always finds me  
Taken again by surprise  
  
I could stand here an angry young woman  
Taking all the pain to heart  
But I know that love can bring changes  
And so we've got to move on  
  
If our God His Son not sparing  
Came to rescue you  
Is there any circumstance  
That He can't see you through

You are my first love sweet and gentle as the night  
Just being near  
You now is like a lullaby  
All that I have I'd give away to follow You  
I can't imagine having life without you  
Oh. When all these worldly battles seem to never cease  
You simply lift me up and rest me in Your peace  
I heard some people say you're only in my mind  
I hope that someday You choose to find them.  
All other loves will slowly fade like dying flame  
Tomorrow, now, and yesterday  
You're still the same I wait with longing heart to see You come again  
Your sweet and tender love will never end.  

In the year of 1492  
When Columbus sailed the ocean blue  
Had he landed on India's shore  
You might never have come to knock on my door.  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason?  
Some dreams we're made to find  
So I know that I must follow  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love.  
  
Through the rain clouds thundering nights  
Mr. Franklin stood there holding his kite  
He was crazy always pressing his luck  
But he got what he wanted when lightning struck, yeah.  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason?  
Some dreams we're made to find  
So I know that I must follow  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light.  
  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love.  
  
I believe in you and the special love we could share  
And maybe one day darling you'll turn around  
And all I really know is I will be there.  
  
Who needs a rhyme or a reason?  
This dream was made to find  
So I know that I will follow  
  
Ask me just how much I love you  
You are starlight, I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light  
I will find the shining light of our love.  
  
Ask me just how much I love you (of our love)  
I'm Galileo  
Even on the darkest night oh  
I will find the shining light of our love  
Ask me just how much I love you (of our love)  
I'm Galileo.

Giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know it's still true  
That He's always gonna love me  
So just laugh out...  
If you think I'm uncool  
Playin' the part of the fool  
'Cause I love Him!  
Don't you know how I love Him?  
Oh, well, I do!  
When I see somebody cryin'  
Some person who's real mean  
I want to quickly walk right by him  
But I'll stop for You  
Dear Lord, but  
Must I hug him real tight now?  
He smells so bad, I'll faint  
What will my friends think if I kill my pride, I can't  
Well, giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know it's still true  
That He's always gonna love me  
So just laugh out...  
If you think I'm uncool  
Playin' the part of the fool  
'Cause I love Him!  
Don't you know how I love Him?  
Oh, well, I do!  
When I'm in a sticky situation  
Sitting in a class at school  
Everyone is talking evolution  
No one talks of You  
My hand goes up  
I don't want to be too pushy  
My arm, it feels like lead  
But there's such a joy they're missing saying, "God is dead"  
So giggle  
Giggle if you want to  
But I know it's still true  
That He's always gonna love me  
So just laugh out...  
If you think I'm uncool  
Always playin' the part of the fool  
'Cause I love Him!  
Don't you know how I love Him?  
Oh, well, I do!

You like to dance and listen to the music  
I like to sing with the band  
You like your hands splashing in the ocean  
Well I like me feet on the sand  
Does anybody have it any better?  
Isn't it easy to see just how well we fit together?  
  
When I start to sing the blues  
You pull out my dancing shoes  
I think you could be so good for me  
You get brave when I get shy  
Just another reason why  
I think you could be so good for me  
So good.  
  
You like to drive like Mario Andretti  
I like it taking my time  
But let me say wherever you are going  
You know it suits me just fine  
Does anybody have it any better?  
Isn't it easy to see just how well we fit together?  
  
When I start to sing the blues  
You pull out my dancing shoes  
I think you could be so good for me  
You get brave when I get shy  
Just another reason why  
I think you could be so good for me  
So good.  
  
Could be so good for me

Could be so good for me.  
  
You get brave when I get shy  
Another reason why  
You could be so good for

When I want to sing the blues  
Good for me baby  
Oh when I want to sing the blues

When I want to sing the blues  
Good for me baby.

All my life-time plans,  
I got em in my hands.  
Balancing my fate upon a wire.  
Got to let it go.  
Everywhere I turn I see  
There's nowhere left to go.  
All my dreams are far,  
Too much for me to hold.  
Still I hate to drop them,  
Weren't they from you?  
What did I do?  
  
You are the one that can see,  
Into the heart of me.  
Am I really giving up tomorrow?  
Got, got, got to let it go.  
This is gonna hurt a little,  
Still its right I know.  
Got to let it --  
Even though I fear  
Too much of me might show,  
I cant wait any longer for it,  
I've had enough!  
Ill give it up!  
  
Lord, here's my heart,  
I've been keeping it from you,  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go,  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Go to let it, got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!  
  
Holding on too tight,  
Where do I lose sight?  
Wheres the lamb that seems to bring frustration,  
Go to let it go.  
The best of dreams can turn to nightmares,  
When my heart takes hold.  
How long must I learn?  
This lessons getting old,  
I've got to catch a clearer vision,  
I'm in your hands!  
You're in command!  
  
Lord, here's my heart (here's my heart, here's my heart)  
I've been keeping it (keeping it, keeping it) from you!  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go.  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Oh, I've got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!  
  
Lord, here's my heart (here's my heart, here's my heart)  
I've been keeping it (keeping it, keeping it) from you!  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go.  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Oh, I've got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!  
  
Lord, here's my heart (here's my heart, here's my heart)  
I've been keeping it (keeping it, keeping it) from you!  
And I got to let it go.  
Holding on just breaks me, worry,  
Got to let it go.  
Come and take it from me, hurry,  
Got to let it go.  
Oh, I've got to let it go.  
Got to give up all of my control!

I am a small and lonely grape  
Clutching to the vine  
Waiting for the day when I'll become my Savior's wine  
Oh, wouldn't French cuisine just yearn it  
I've eternity to ferment  
But knowing me I'd end up ripple  
In a cellar of cheblis  
Are you a small and lonely grape  
Clutching to the vine  
Waiting for the day when you'll become your Savior's wine?  
Don't give up hope ye heavy laden  
You don't want to be a raisin  
There's a grape, grape joy in Jesus  
In the vineyard of The Lord  

Do you remember me?  
I sat upon your knee.  
I wrote to you with childhood fantasies.  
Well, I'm all grown up now,  
And still need help somehow.  
I'm not a child but my heart still can dream.  
  
So here's my lifelong wish,  
My grown-up Christmas list,  
Not for myself, but for a world in need:  
  
No more lives torn apart,  
That wars would never start,  
And time would heal all hearts.  
And everyone would have a friend,  
And right would always win,  
And love would never end:  
This is my grown-up Christmas list.  
  
As children we believed  
The grandest sight to see  
Was something lovely wrapped beneath our tree.  
Well, heaven surely knows  
That packages and bows  
Can never heal a hurting human soul.  
  
No more lives torn apart,  
That wars would never start,  
And time would heal all hearts.  
Everyone would have a friend,  
And right would always win,  
And love would never end:  
This is my grown-up Christmas list,  
This is my only lifelong wish,  
This is my grown-up Christmas list!

I wanna look behind your eyes  
And gently brush the hair back from the face  
Cause baby I just realized  
Seeing you there in that light  
Is better to be kind and right  
And I'm about to bridge this kiss between us  
  
'Cause baby I'm ready to dig in  
Ready for more than skin on skin  
This is where love begins  
So I say  
  
I'm gonna tell you bout my man  
'cause it makes you happy  
I wanna brush to hold your hand  
Why know it makes me happy  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause I know it makes you happy  
  
I know I've made some big mistakes  
I learned the hardest lessons that await  
So adios to foolish pride  
I've got nothing left to hide  
I stand here open wide  
And everything inside of me is saying  
  
Baby I'm ready to dig in  
Ready for more than skin on skin  
This is where love begins  
So I say  
  
I'm gonna tell you you're my man  
'Cause it makes you happy  
I wanna rush to hold your hand  
It makes me so happy  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause I know it makes you happy  
Oh, why know I'll make you happy  
And I wanna see you happy  
  
I want us to be happy  
  
And we're going to be happy  
  
'Cause baby I'm ready to dig in  
Ready for more than skin on skin  
This is where love begins  
  
I wanna rush to hold your hand  
I wanna see you happy  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause why know it makes you happy  
Oh, why know I'll make you happy  
Why know I wanna see you happy

And I love your smile

'Cause that's what makes me happy  
Oh why know I'll make you happy  
And I want us to be happy  
  
I'm gonna tell you you're my man  
I wanna rush to hold your hand  
I'm gonna love you best I can  
'Cause I know it makes you happy

The sun comes up  
The breakfast show  
Can't you see me running  
It's crazy don't you know?  
(Don't you know? Don't you know?)  
  
The moon is high  
I'm working through the night  
Will somebody tell me  
Where do all the hours go?  
(I don't know - I don't know.)  
  
It don't stop  
No, it's never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
One day I'm a lover  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best for you.  
  
The water is hot  
(So hot)  
The phone don't stop  
(Hello, good-bye)  
So how do I manage  
To hold on to my sanity?  
(I don't know, baby, I don't know)  
  
The red dress on  
Time for having fun  
(Time for having fun)  
But can I really be  
The girl you think you see in me?  
  
The spirit is willing  
But the flesh is weak  
Why do I have to wear so many things on my head?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
(Working for a livin')  
All because I'm driven  
(All because I'm driven)  
To be the very best for you.  
  
Hats!  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best for you.  
  
This may be a dream come true  
This may be poetry in motion  
This may be a dream come true  
But when it all comes down  
It's an awful lot to do.  
  
Hats!  
It don't stop  
No it's never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear things on my head?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
(Working for a livin')  
All because I'm driven  
(All because I'm driven)  
To be the very best for you.  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
(One day I'm a mother)  
One day I'm a lover  
(One day I'm a lover)  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best,  
Very best (Nah, Nah, Nah).  
  
Hats!  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
(Working for a livin')  
All because I'm driven  
(All because I'm driven)  
To be the very best  
  
It don't stop  
No, it's never gonna stop  
Why do I have to wear?  
Why to I have to wear?  
Hats!  
  
One day I'm a mother  
One day I'm a lover  
What am I supposed to do?  
Hats!  
Working for a livin'  
All because I'm driven  
To be the very best for you.

Have yourself a Merry little Christmas  
Let your heart be light  
From now on our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a Merry little Christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on our troubles will be miles away  
  
Once again as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us will be near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hanging a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a Merry little Christmas now

He gave me a new song  
He really came down here  
Himself and sang it for me  
In every key  
Just for me he gave me a new light,  
Now even when clouds hide the sun my life is still bright  
'Cause everything's alright  
He gave me a new song  
He really came down here  
Himself and sang it for me  
In every key  
Just for me  
He gave me a love song  
Yes it's the first real love song given to me  
And oh, what a melody.  

[Chorus:]  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Take a look at your fellow man  
And tell me what can I do today  
'Cause everybody needs a helping out  
If that ain't what it's all about  
  
Tell me what  
What can I do  
What can I do today  
We've all seen trouble from time to time  
There is a mountain ahead  
I've got no strength to climb, hey  
If you're feeling that you're strong  
Reach out to me  
I hope this journey won't take long  
But won't you please  
Have mercy  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
What can I do today  
I'm talking 'bout the soul all alone  
Needing the daily bread  
Someplace to lay his head, yeah, hey  
And I'm talking about the neighbor on your street  
Won't you look him in the eye  
Take time to speak  
That's mercy, yeah, 'cause...  
  
(Repeat Chorus)  
  
Love one another  
Sister and brother  
Love is the only way, hey  
  
(Repeat Chorus Twice)  
  
What can I do today  
Everybody needs a helpin', helpin'  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs a helpin', helpin'  
Everybody needs a helping hand

Oh, yeah, everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs it, oh, everybody needs it  
Everybody needs a helping hand  
Everybody needs it

What does all this beauty mean?  
It captures my attention and I'm speechless  
Sunset, Tennessee, colors burn across the sky  
Slowly fading golden rays  
Greet the moon and kiss the day goodbye  
And I do, I understand  
Is this Your voice, saying "Here I am"?  
  
I am here in the dark  
In the quiet of your heart  
I am here in your corner of the sky  
I'm the light that fades away  
At the turning of this day  
I am here, I am here  
Here, yeah  
  
What does all this music mean?  
The rhythm of a heartbeat and the symphony of every living thing  
Ringing throughout time  
The song of every single soul  
In harmony our voices intertwined  
And when did all begin?  
Was it Your voice, saying "Here I am"?  
  
I am here in the dark  
I'm the music in your heart  
I'm the song in every corner of the sky  
I am here in the light  
In the thunder late at night  
I am here, I am here  
Here, I am here  
  
I am here in the dark  
I'm the song in your heart  
I'm the missing piece that you've had all along  
I am here when you call  
When you rise and when you fall  
I am here, I am here  
I am here, I am here  
Here, here  
I am here  
Here, here

Hey now, I will be praying for you  
Hey now, you're gonna pray for me  
'cause what we have been through together  
Is changing us now, can change us forever  
Hey now, I'm gonna pray for you  
Hey now, you're gonna pray for me  
And it's gonna be different, yeah  
It's gonna be better, yeah  
It's gonna be Jesus and all of us in this together  
  
Hey now, I'm gonna pray for you  
Hey now, you're gonna pray for me  
'cause what we have been through together  
Is changing us now, can change us forever  
Hey now, I'm gonna pray for you  
Hey now, you're gonna pray for me  
And it's gonna be different, yeah  
It's gonna be better, yeah  
It's gonna be Jesus and all of us in this together  
Hey! hey! hey! now  
I'm gonna pray for you  
Hey now, you're gonna pray for me  
And it's gonna be different, yeah  
It's gonna be better, yeah  
It's gonna be Jesus and all of us in this together  
Hey! hey! hey! now, hey now, hey now  
  
Hey! hey! hey! now

Hey now, you're gonna pray for me  
And it's gonna be different, yeah

Hey! hey! hey! now, hey now, hey now

Who I have become in You  
Is grace beyond all measure  
In the light of all You are  
Who am I to be found here?  
  
Who I have become in You  
Is grace beyond all measure  
Raised to life and crowned with love  
Jesus, Yours forever  
  
Majesty and mercy  
Meet me in this moment  
How can it be that I have been  
Chosen by the King?  
  
There's no greater honor  
There's no greater treasure  
Than to be known and loved by You  
I am highly favored, I am highly favored  
  
A child of grace I have become  
Adopted into favor  
Now I sing Your Spirit's song  
Crying, "Abba Father"  
  
Majesty and mercy  
Meet me in this moment

Chosen by the King?

I've got my hope set high  
That's why I came tonight  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light.  
  
I've got my hope set high  
That's why I came tonight  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light  
And I can do my best  
And pray to the Father  
But the one thing I oughta know by now  
  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
You know that when it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
I've got my hope set high  
And like a star at night  
Out of the deepest dark  
It shines the purest light.  
  
I've got my hope set high  
Beyond the wrong and right  
I need to see the truth  
I need to see the light  
'Cause I can do my best  
And pray to the Father  
But the one thing I ought to know by now  
  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
Oh and when it all comes down  
When it all comes down  
If there's anything good that happens in life  
It's from Jesus.  
  
Oh

[Chorus:]  
  
Well, I bet you any amount of money  
He'll be coming back to you  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love  
  
Ooh, house of love  
  
You've been up all night  
Thinking it was over  
He's been out of sight  
At least for the moment  
But when something this strong  
Ooh, Gets a hold on you  
The odds are ninety-nine to one  
It's got a hold on him too  
  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love  
  
Now when the house is dark  
And you're all alone inside  
You've gotta listen to your heart  
And put away your foolish pride  
Though the storm is breaking  
And thunder shakes the walls  
Love with a firm foundation  
Ain't never, never, never gonna fall  
  
Though the storm is breaking  
And thunder shakes the walls  
Love with a firm foundation  
Ain't never, never, never gonna fall  
  
Well, I bet you any amount of money  
He'll come back to you  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming, lights are coming on  
  
Well, I bet you any amount of money, baby  
He'll be coming back to you  
Back to you, back to you  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love  
Ooh, yeah  
Ooh, I know there ain't no doubt about it  
Sometimes life is funny  
You think you're in your darkest hour  
When the lights are coming on in the house of love

We said our promises by candlelight  
You held my hands, I was dressed in white  
We were young  
How can we see that far?  
How can we see that far?  
  
I knew I wanted you like no one else  
I told my momma that I'd found myself  
In your eyes  
How can we see that far?  
How can we see that far?  
  
But like your daddy said  
The same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  
And the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  
And the mighty wind that knocks us down  
If we lean into it  
Will drive our fears away.  
  
And then I woke you in the dead of night  
To hold my hands, push away the fright  
Life had come (how can we see that far?) - a son  
How can we see that far?  
  
Yeah, we were nervous and a little scared  
Until the music of our baby's cry  
Filled the air  
How can we see that far? (How can we see that far?)  
  
But like your daddy said  
The same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  
And the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  
And the mighty wind that knocks us down  
If we lean into it  
Will drive our fears away.  
  
We might die  
We might live  
We could hurt each other badly  
Do things, things so hard to forgive  
Ooh, and if time is not our friend  
Your mind might forget me before the end  
And oh, I cannot  
I cannot look that far.  
  
But like your daddy said  
(How can we see that far?)  
The same sun that melts the wax can harden clay  
And the same rain that drowns the rat will grow the hay  
And the mighty wind that knocks us down  
If we lean into it  
How can we see that far?  
Gotta lean into it  
Will drive our fears away  
  
It's the same sun, yeah  
And the same rain  
It's the same sun  
And the same rain.

The water rose today,  
The river with the rain  
Memories and picture frames  
Are floating miles away.  
Through the wreckage and the mud,  
The ruins after the flood,  
She survived at 91, hmm  
  
Some would have given up  
Drowning in their tears  
But on her wrinkled face  
A smile appeared.  
  
When you face your greatest fear  
Losing all that you hold near  
Open up your eyes my dear,  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
The call I couldn't take,  
Unbearable mistakes  
A brilliant mind that fades away  
A baby doll beside the grave  
  
When you face your greatest fear  
Losing all that you hold near  
Open up your eyes my dear  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
I would have given up, drowning in my tears  
If it wasn't for your voice all these years  
  
When you face your greatest fear  
Losing all that you hold near  
Open up your eyes my dear  
My dear  
  
That's when boundless grace appears  
Unseen angels hover near  
Saints are singing loud and clear  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
Oh how mercy looks from here.  
  
The water rose today

This is one of those moments  
When all that really matters  
Is crystal clear  
  
We are woven together  
By whatever threads of life that have  
Brought us here  
  
We are stripped of all our layers  
We are getting to the core  
Tell me something real  
And nothing more  
  
'cause I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is love  
  
So I'm here between the bookends  
Of everything that was and What will be  
  
There's a wealth of every nation  
Not so many answers  
It seems to me  
  
So I face the unfamiliar  
And nothing's clear  
Only blinding faith can carry me can carry me from here  
  
And I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is love  
  
Hold my hand and hold this moment  
Time sure feels precious don't it  
Life is always changing  
This I know  
  
I don't know why  
I don't know how  
I don't know where  
Baby all I know is now  
Baby all I know is now

Some people always know the right thing to say  
I don't really think I was born that way  
And with the gift of charm, they're well endowed  
I love to watch them float right through a crowd  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
One day I met a man who showed me love  
There standing on His head was a snow white dove  
And He said,"Once I came down to this mire for you  
But I'm the Son of God, He's your Father too"  
It wasn't long before my new walk began  
Since I found Jesus, my life is in His hands  
Now I have life, no one can take it from me  
And I've a home above I'm waiting to see  
There're many rooms in the House of the Lord  
Why don't you come along and bring someone more?  
I used to think it took a giggly girl  
To win some fame in this mixed around world  
But I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now, I know better now  
I know better now  
I know, I know, I know  
I know better now  

TV's off at 1 a.m.  
One more day alone again  
The work gets longer every day  
Why'd I have to get away?  
But I have found a comfort here  
Solitude can be so dear  
Loneliness is not so blue  
When it puts my mind on you  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It makes me think of you  
(I love a lonely day)  
All alone, I can easily find your love, I love  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It chases me to you  
(I love a lonely day)  
It clears my heart  
Lets my very best part shine through, it's you  
Lonely people everywhere  
Lucky, lonely ones who care  
You've got all you need and more  
Someone to be lonely for  
Someone cries for you to hear  
Take your heart and wipe that tear  
Give them someone they can miss  
Give them love and sing them this  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It makes me think of you  
(I love a lonely day)  
All alone, I can easily find your love, I love  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It chases me to you  
(I love a lonely day)  
It clears my heart  
Lets my very best part shine through, oh, it's you  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It makes me think of you  
(I love a lonely day)  
All alone, I can easily find your love, I love  
I love a lonely day  
(I love a lonely day)  
It chases me to you  
(I love a lonely day)  

All to Jesus I surrender  
All to Him I freely give  
I will ever love and trust Him  
In His presence daily live  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all  
  
All to Jesus I surrender  
At Thy feet I humbly bow  
Worldly pleasures all forsaken  
Take me, Jesus, take me now  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all  
  
All to Jesus I surrender  
Lord, I give myself to Thee  
Fill me with Thy love and power  
Let Thy blessing fall on me  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all  
  
I surrender all, I surrender all  
All to Thee my blessed Savior  
I surrender all, I surrender all, I surrender all

When every moment gets too hard  
End of the road can feel so far  
No matter how much time we're apart  
I'm always near you  
  
I'll be the shelter in your rain  
Help you to find your smile again  
I'll make you laugh at a broken heart  
Wherever you are  
  
Cause I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
Yeah  
I will be your friend  
  
So many people come and go  
Nothing can change the you I know  
You'll never be just a face in the crowd  
And time will show  
  
Through the seasons and the years (and the years)  
I will always hold you dear  
Never you fear  
  
I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
Cause I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
I'll be your rock when every candle burns down low  
And I want you, and I want you to know  
  
I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
'Cause I'm never gonna walk away  
If the walls come down someday  
All alone and you feel afraid  
I'll be there when you call my name  
You can always depend on me  
I believe until forever ends  
I will be your friend  
  
I will be your friend  
I will be your friend

Do you have a heavy heart? 'Cause you try to play the part  
Of a life that you don't know and now it's scaring you?  
'Cause you're saying all the right words but no one's ever heard  
The voice that's crying out inside your heart  
Saying please don't make me die for you, I've gotta make you see  
That there's a part of me I never want to lose  
But if I have to die for you somehow let me see  
That you're more than words I need a glimpse of you  
But it's Sunday church again and the habit to pretend  
Is stronger than you knew, look how it's ruling you  
But it's friends you try to blame, oh I've done it just the same  
'Cause it's easier than answering to Him  
You think that they're playing games  
They leave and never act the same  
And you don't want a part of their show  
Yes you think there's something more  
But not inside these holy doors  
Well what are you looking for?  
Yes we have to die for Him, that's the struggle that you see?  
'Cause it's the hardest thing you'll ever have to do  
But no it's not impossible, He's been waiting so long for you  
But don't be afraid 'cause He knows the pain  
Because He had to do it for you, for you  

I'm dreaming tonight of a place i love  
Even more than i usually do  
And although i know  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas  
You can count on me  
Please have snow and mistletoe and presents under the tree  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams  
  
Christmas eve will find me  
Where the love light gleams  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams

All my my friends are happy to stay  
Here in this yard day after day  
But something inside me has called me away  
I don't understand but I know I can't stay  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I'm lighter than air  
  
Cause I have felt for the first time  
I can be myself  
No more faces to hide behind  
Just a smile and a dream that's mine  
Even if I am the only one who wants to fly  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I soar through the air  
  
All of my life seems I've waited  
For the time to start  
Being the person inside of me  
Unafraid of being me  
No more faces to hide behind  
Just a smile and a dream that's mine  
Even if I'm the only one who wants to fly  
  
If I had my life to live over again  
I'd run bare foot, relax a bit more  
And I'd talk to more children  
And I'd learn how they laugh  
And I'd teach them how I've learned to fly  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I'm lighter than air  
  
I'm gonna fly  
No one knows where  
But I'm gonna fly  
I soar through the air  
  
Cause all of my life seems I've waited  
For the time to start  
Being the person inside of me  
Unafraid of being me  
Even if I'm the only one who wants to fly  
I'm gonna fly

I can't relive my life  
I can't retrace my tracks  
I can't undo what's done  
There is no going back  
I chased a selfish dream  
Did not survey the cost  
Illusions disappeared  
I've found my innocence lost  
Some say it's lessons learned  
Some say it's a living life  
I say it's choices made  
Knowing wrong from right  
One night I fought to sleep  
In my slumber I turned and tossed  
I woke to a cloudy day  
And found my innocence lost  
Innocent child is a beautiful thing  
Secure in her father's arms  
Sleeps while a mother sings  
There's no way to know  
All the harm this world can bring  
I miss my innocence  
Oh, to be innocent  
My heavenly Father  
The way of eternal love  
That overflows with grace  
I can completely trust  
My broken heart repaired  
And all my sin forgot  
I can be pure again  
In spite of my innocence lost  
In his eyes I'm a newborn child  
'cause I accept his love  
I have a newfound hope  
Though I've found my innocence lost  
I can be pure again  
I've found my innocence lost  
  

Out on the edge  
I've been drifting in darkness lately  
Carrying a heart so confused  
Standing on the ledge  
You still hold me when life gets crazy  
Where should I be without You and Your  
Chorus  
Irresistible love  
That is saving me  
I've been running I know  
Irresistible love is amazing me  
You touch my soul  
Only You can make me whole  
Can't turn away  
From love that is all around me  
Melting the hardest hearts  
So overwhelmed with a mercy  
That sought and found me  
I should've known from the start  
It's Your  
Chorus  
Bridge  
I'm captivated by the way You  
Reach for me so faithfully  
It's Your  
Chorus

It must have happened sometime in the night  
No one saw the stone be rolled away  
When the grave saw morning light  
The skeptics and friends all had to say  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
My soul is like a tomb in constant night  
Till one day the stone was rolled away  
Then my heart saw morning light  
And no one alive can explain it away  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
Now, now won't you see  
What I'm trying to say?  
If you believe, it could happen today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, it's a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
It's a miracle happened today  
It's a miracle, what a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
A miracle, a miracle  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
A miracle, a miracle  
(It's a miracle)  
You know it's really a miracle  
He took the stone and He rolled it away  

It's the most wonderful time of the year  
  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
With the kids jingle-belling  
And everyone telling you be of good cheer  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
With those holiday greetings and gay happy meetings  
When friend come to call  
It's the hap-happiest season of all  
There'll be parties for hosting  
Marshmallows for toasting  
And caroling out in the snow  
There'll be scary ghost story  
And tales of glories of christmas long, long ago  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  
There'll be much mistletoe-ing and hearts will be glowing  
When love ones are near  
It's the most wonderful time  
It's the most wonderful time  
It's the most wonderful time of the year  

Stayed in bed all morning just to pass the time  
There's something wrong here, there can be no denying  
One of us is changing, or maybe we've stopped trying  
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
It used to be so easy living here with you  
You where light and breezy and I knew just what to do  
Now you look so unhappy, and I feel like a fool  
And it's too late, baby, now it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it  
There'll be good times again for me and you  
But we just can't stay together, don't you feel it too  
Still I'm glad for what we had, and how I once loved you  
But it's too late, baby, it's too late  
Though we really did try to make it  
Something inside has died and I can't hide  
And I just can't fake it

Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bell swing  
And jingle bells ring  
Snowin' and blowin'  
Up bushels of fun  
Now the jingle hop has begun  
  
Jingle bell, jingle bell  
Jingle bell rock  
Jingle bells chime in  
Jingle bell time  
Dancin' and prancin'  
In jingle bell square  
In the frosty air  
  
What a bright time  
It's the right time  
To rock the night away  
Jingle bell, time  
Is a swell time  
To go glidin' in a  
One horse sleigh  
  
Giddy-up, jingle horse  
Pick up your feet  
Jingle around the clock  
Mix and mingle  
In a jinglin' beat  
That's the jingle bell rock

It's a cold, cold world  
That we're walking through.  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
But it's warm as toast  
Walking two by two,  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.  
  
It's a fine, fine line  
Betwixt love and hate.  
Why, it's tough to tell the two apart.  
But you know it's love  
That He offers you.  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.  
  
Lay down the burden of your heart.  
I know you'll never miss it.  
Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.  
  
Ohh-ohh, show your Daddy where it hurts,  
And let your Daddy lift it.

Shoulder to the wheel  
For someone else's selfish gain  
Here there is no choosing  
Working the clay  
Wearing their anger like a ball and chain.  
  
Fire in the field  
Underneath a blazing sun  
But soon the sun was faded  
And freedom was a song  
I heard them singing when the day was done  
Singing to the holy One.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
To a place where the river runs  
Into your keeping, oh.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
The awaited deliverance  
Comforts the seeking, lead on.  
  
Waiting for the train  
Labelled with a golden star  
Heavy hearted boarding  
Whispers in the dark  
"Where are we going--is it very far?"  
  
Bitter cold terrain  
Echoes of a slamming door  
In chambers made for sleeping, forever  
Voices like thunder in a mighty roar  
Cry to the Lord.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
To a place where the river runs  
Into your keeping, oh.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
The awaited deliverance  
Comforts the seeking, lead on.  
  
Man hurts man  
Time and time, time again  
And we drown in the wake of our power  
Somebody tell me why.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
To a place where the river runs  
Into your keeping, oh.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
The awaited deliverance  
Comforts the seeking, lead on.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
To a place where the river runs  
Into your keeping, oh.  
  
Lead me on  
Lead me on  
The awaited deliverance  
Comforts the seeking, lead on.

I took a drive along the west bank of the shore  
I thought of what you said then I thought some more  
You say your life is all but chiseled out in stone  
And all you want is just a taste of the unknown  
  
Think it was yesterday I called you on the phone  
You say you need a change, I recognize the tone  
Buy me a ticket please, to anywhere I'll go  
I'm not saying what is right or what is wrong  
I'm just thinking you've been hanging here too long  
  
[Chorus:]  
So, why don't we, just up and leave it all behind  
Maybe a change would ease your mind  
For a time, leave it all behind  
  
What I really want to do is see you smile  
Hear you talk and let me listen for a while  
There's too much going on to keep it all inside  
You try to whisper, but you start to scream and shout  
What you need is just a place to let it out  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You try to whisper but you start to scream and shout  
What you need is just a place to let it out  
  
[Chorus:]

Why do lovers drift apart?  
How does love fade away?  
When do pieces of a broken heart mend again?  
You've been crying in the dark  
And you've been feeling alone  
Don't be scared of what you find  
When you turn the light on  
  
Ain't nobody gonna say goodbye  
No, ain't nobody gonna walk away  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry  
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you  
Like I love you  
  
What sad memory of yesterday  
What terrible scar  
Keeps you gathering pieces of  
Your shattered heart  
There was once upon a time  
When hope was living within  
And I know there will come a time  
When you can believe again  
  
Ain't nobody gonna say goodbye  
No, ain't nobody gonna walk away  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry  
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you  
Like I love you  
  
How long have you been feeling lonely?  
How long have you been feeling sad and blue?  
  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Ain't nobody gonna make you cry  
No, ain't nobody ever really tried to love you  
Like I love you  
  
This time, baby, I'm learning how to love you, love you  
Let me love you, like I love you

Written by Amy Grant  
Your smile lights up a room  
Like a candle in the dark  
It warms me through and through  
And I guess that I had dreamed  
We would never be apart  
But that dream did not come true  
And  
Chorus:  
Missing you is just a part of living  
And missing you feels like a way of life  
I'm living out the life that I've been given  
But baby I still wish you were mine  
And I cannot hear the telephone  
Jangle on the wall  
And not feel a hopeful thrill  
And I cannot help but smile  
At any new of you at all  
And I guess I always will  
'Cause  
(Repeat Chorus)  
Hey, yeah  
(Repeat Chorus)  
I'm living out the life that I've been given  
But baby I still wish that you were mine

In the morning when I wake and my feet can find the floor  
I stumble down the hall and I open up the door  
Then I look into the mirror just like you know you do  
Stopping for a moment  
I can feel my mind go through the boundaries of time  
Back to a heart without his love inside  
I was more than just alone, I was dying on my own  
Thinking that nothing was ever gonna save my life  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
What I'm beginning to be look what, look what  
When you stop and think it over do you think you're doing well  
Are you getting stronger, can you really tell?  
If you're truthful with your feelings then you'll see there's room to grow  
Though we may have found the answer  
There is so much more to know, more to this life  
'Cause we can never stop growin' or we'll start to die  
I cannot survive alone, I am nothin' on my own  
But seeing's believin' and if you need to see look at me  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
Look what has happened, look what, look what  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
What I'm beginning to be, look what, look what  
Look what has happened to me I find it hard to believe  
His love has taken my life this far so far  
Look what has happened to me my mind can hardly conceive  
What I'm beginning to be, look what, look what  

I've waited so long now  
I've wanted forever to hold you  
Now you're in my arms  
And I'll never let you go  
  
Whatever you do, why'know  
I'll be standing here beside you baby  
Just like a bird that's find it's way back home  
I've finally found a place where I belong  
  
I've been looking for you since I took my first breath  
And I'll be loving you baby til I take my last  
I'd like to know  
What would I do without you in my life  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
I was looking for you  
  
Can I wake up now  
Can I believe what I'm feeling  
And I'll be sure I wasn't dreaming it all  
  
Baby it's true, you do  
Something supernatural to me  
Each night I pray to God that you'll be blessed  
I need you so much baby I confess  
  
I've been looking for you since I took my first breath  
And I'll be loving you baby til I take my last  
I'd like to know  
What would I do without you in my life  
All along I was waiting for you  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
It had to be you  
  
So sure yours  
Together ever after  
Now the dream came true  
And maybe when you least expect it love will come to you  
  
I'd like to know what would I do without you in my life  
All along I was waiting for you  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
It had to be you  
  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was looking for looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
All along I was looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you  
Sweet love came to my life  
From the moment I saw you I knew  
Sweet love came to my life  
Looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was looking for you  
Sweet love came to my life  
I was thinking about you

I have found a perfect mystery  
Love has a hold on me  
Long before my life had come to be  
Love had a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
Where do I come from  
Where does life mean  
Is it not to know the one who made me  
  
As I'm looking down the road ahead  
Love has a hold on me  
Someday when I breathe my dying breath  
Love has a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
Where will I go  
When this life is through  
Back into the light that made me and you  
  
Love has a hold on me  
Something opened up my eyes to see  
Love has a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
I don't have answers to all the questions  
Running inside of my mind  
But I can't help believe that  
Understanding comes in time  
  
Love has a hold on me  
Something opened up my eyes to see  
Love has a hold on me  
Love has a hold on me  
  
If I run, if I hide, I know inside  
Your love has a hold on me  
Tell me yes, tell me no, my heart will follow  
Your love has a hold on me  
  
If I run, if I hide  
Your love has a hold on me  
Your love has a hold on me  
Your love has a hold on me  
Hold on me

Hurry now wake up your eyes  
Time for little ones to see  
Daddy's got a big surprise  
Hiding there beneath the Christmas tree  
How they are like the child in me!  
See the wonder in their eyes  
Like a fairytale come true  
One more time I realize  
All the love our lives found in you  
  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Sent his son  
  
If I could have a special dream  
Coming true on Christmas morn'  
I would want the world to see  
How his father smiled when Christ was born  
The greatest gift the world has known!  
So come on kids, look high and low  
For all the toys you've dreamed to find  
But I believe you'll never know  
A greater joy than Jesus' love inside  
  
(You gotta know!)  
(Know!)  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
(Don't you know that)  
Love has come  
For the world to know (know)  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
(Don't you know)  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago  
And I believe that angels sang  
That hope had begun  
When the god of glory  
Who is full of mercy  
Yes, the god of glory  
Sent his son  
  
(i can see that)  
Love has come  
For the world to know  
As the wise men knew  
Such a long time ago

They say love is cruel, they say love is rather fragile  
But I've found in You a love of another kind  
They say love brings hurt I say love brings healing  
Understanding first it's a love of another kind  
The love I know is a love so few discover  
They need to know Jesus' love is like no other  
They save love won't last I say love is never ending  
'Cause in You I have a love of another kind  
They would change their tune they would add another measure  
If they only knew this love of another kind  
The love I know is a love so few discover  
They need to know Jesus' love is like no other  
They say love is cruel, they say love is rather fragile  
But I've found in You a love of another kind  
They say love brings hurt I say love brings healing  
Understanding first it's a love of another kind  
They save love won't last I say love is never ending  
'Cause in You I have a love of another kind  
They would change their tune they would add another measure  
If they only knew this love of another kind  
Love of another kind  
The love of another kind  
The love of another kind  
The love of another, the love of another kind  
Give me love this is love  
(This is love)  
Another kind, another kind of love  
This is love  
(This is love)  
You need another kind of love  
Another kind, another kind of love  
Another kind of love  
This is love  
(Give me love)  
Another kind, another kind of love  

Mmm, when I see the winter  
Turning into spring,  
Oh, it speaks to this heart of mine  
More than anything.  
Underneath a blanket of snow  
Cold and white,  
Something is stirring in the still of the night.  
When the sun comes up  
Slowly with the dawn,  
Oh, this is the common feeling  
That I hang my hope up on.  
There is a love and beauty  
In all that I see  
And no one, nobody  
Is explaining you to me.  
  
And maybe my eyes can't see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain,  
The things that I know.  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead,  
I know the voice, I know the touch,  
Lover of my soul.  
  
When the evening sun  
Slowly fades to red  
Time and time and time again  
I whisper in my head.  
Give me grace  
Give me strength  
To firmly believe  
That the maker of this whole wide world is a father to me.  
  
And maybe my eyes can't see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain,  
The things that I know.  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead,  
I know the voice, I know the touch,  
Lover of my soul.  
  
And maybe my eyes can't see  
But you are surrounding me  
Here in the wind and rain,  
The things that I know.  
Are tender and sweet  
This song as my lead,  
I know the voice, I know the touch,  
Lover of my soul.

Writers: Amy Grant, Keith Thomas  
You're the kind  
When you love you love with all your might and  
You're the kind  
I would dream about at night  
Now I'm the lucky one  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
You're the kind  
That I want to be with in the dark and  
You're the kind  
Who is capturing my heart  
And I'm the lucky one  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon  
But I could never face another night or day without you  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
You're the kind  
With poetry and valentines and  
You're the kind  
Who will never ever leave  
And I'm the lucky one  
The luckiest girl  
My, my, my baby  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
And I have never been the one to fall in love so soon  
But I could never face another night or day without you, you-hoo  
I'm the lucky one  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
I said  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Ah, my, my, my baby  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, hey, I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Ah, my, my, my baby  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Hey I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Baby I'm the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Doot-doo, the lucky one  
Doot-doo, doot-doo-n-doo-doo  
Hey I'm the lucky one

Your smile lights up a room  
Like a candle in the dark  
It warms me through and through  
And I guess that I had dreamed  
We would never be apart  
But that dream did not come true  
And missing you is just a part of living  
Missing you feels like a way of life  
I'm living out the life that I've been given  
But baby I still wish you were mine  
And I cannot hear the telephone  
Jangle on the wall  
And not feel a hopeful thrill  
And I cannot help but smile  
At any news of you at all  
And I guess I always will  
Cause missing you is just a part of living  
And missing you feels like a way of life  
I'm living out the life that I've been given  
But baby I still wish you were mine  
Missing you is just a part of living  
And missing you feels like a way of life  
I'm living out the life I've been given  
But baby I still wish you were mine  
I'm living out the life that I've been given  
But baby I still wish you were mine  

Mister Santa  
Bring me some toys  
Bring merry Christmas  
To all girls and boys  
And every night  
I'll go to sleep singing  
And dream about  
The presents you'll be bringing  
Santa  
Promise me please  
Give every reindeer  
A hug and a squeeze  
I'll be good  
As good can be  
Mister Santa  
Don't forget me  
  
Mister Santa  
Dear old saint nick  
Be awful careful  
And please don't get sick  
Put on your coat  
When breezes are blowin'  
And when you cross the street  
Look where you're goin'  
Santa  
We've been so good  
We've washed the dishes  
And done what we should  
Made up the beds  
Scrubbed up our toesies  
We've used a Kleenex  
When we've blown our noseies  
Oh Santa  
Look at our ears  
They're clean as whistles  
We're sharper then shears  
Now we've put you on the spot  
Mister Santa  
Bring us a lot

Love like a road that never ends  
How it leads me back again  
To heartache  
I'll never understand  
Darling I put my heart up on a shelf  
'Till the moment was right and I told myself  
Next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
Next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
It will be with you  
  
Now as I look into your eyes  
Well I wonder if it's wise  
To hold you  
Like I've wanted to before  
Tonight oh I was thinking that you might  
Be the one who breathes life in this heart of mine  
  
Next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
Next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
(It will be with you)  
  
Next time I'm gonna follow through  
And if it drives me crazy  
I will know better why  
The next time I try  
  
Next time I fall in love  
I'll know better what to do  
Next time I fall in love  
Oh oh oh  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
The next time I fall in love  
the next time I fall in love

In our times of trouble  
We only had ourselves  
Nobody else  
No one there to save us  
We had to save ourselves  
  
And when the storms came through  
They found me and you  
Back to back together  
And when the sun would shine  
It was yours and mine  
Yours and mine forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh how the years go by  
Oh how the love brings tears to my eyes  
All through the changes the sould never dies  
We fight, we laugh, we cry  
As the years go by  
  
There were times we stumbled  
They thought they had us down  
But we came around  
How we rolled and rambled  
We got lost and we got found  
Now we're back on solid ground, yeah  
  
We took everything  
All our times would bring  
In this world of dangers  
'Cause when your heart is strong  
You know you're not alone  
In this world of strangers  
  
[Chorus]  
And if we lose our way  
Any night or day  
Well we'll always be  
Where we should be  
I'm there for you  
And I know you're there for me  
  
[Chorus]

I don't know what to say to you  
Tears are on your face  
You don't know how we'll make it through  
Such a lonely place  
But if you could read my mind  
Then you'd understand  
Even in times like these  
I'm wanting nothing other than  
Chorus:  
Our love  
You and me together  
Our love  
I'll stay with you  
Our love  
Our love our love is true  
Oh won't you take me in your arms  
That's where I belong  
Together we are safe from harm  
Together we are strong  
I will hold your heart in mine  
And guard it through the night  
Let the stillness of this moment  
Speak to us of all that's right with  
(repeat chorus)  
Our love  
You and me forever  
Our love  
I'm made for you  
Our love  
Our love our love is true  
Close your teary eyes and sleep  
I'll watch through the night and keep  
(repeat chorus)  
Our love  
Our love  

She's looking back to see if he's looking at her  
They talk without any words  
And with a smile, he's moving heaven and earth  
She dreams of holding him tight  
When will the moment be right?  
Got to be diplomatic, a step at a time, don't want to blow it, baby  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
You're finding your way as you go, go, go  
How do you know?  
Head over heels under the moon looking at you but do you feel it too  
And if I move in closer, what will you do?  
'Cause I'm thinking, please hold me tight  
Am I the light in your eyes?  
I wish you had the power for reading my mind  
'Cause I'll never say it to you  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
You're finding your way as you go, go, go  
How do you know?  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, oh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Hear what I'm sayin' to ya  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  
That's the politics of kissing  
To know when to show your hand  
First thoughts, then second guessing  
A subtle supply and demand  
Balance of power, baby, to hold or not to hold  
That's the politics of kissing  

Sometimes my life just don't make sense at all  
And the mountains look so big, and my faith just seems so small  
So hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?  
  
And I wake up in the night, and feel the dark  
It's so hot inside my soul, there must be blisters on my heart  
So hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?  
  
Surrender don't come natural to me  
I'd rather fight you for somethin' I don't really want than take what you've  
Given me  
And I've beat my head against so many walls, I'm fallin' down, I'm fallin' on  
My knees  
  
And the Salvation Army band is playing this hymn  
And your grace rings out so deep, it makes my resistence seem so thin  
Oh, hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?  
  
Oh, hold me, Jesus, I'm shakin' like a leaf  
You have been king of my glory, won't you be my prince of peace?

When all goodbyes  
Are said and done  
And nighttime finds you home  
Are you all right  
To spend a night  
Of being all alone?  
And do you hide  
Between the lines  
Of conversations past?  
A wall of words  
A heart unheard  
That hides behind a mask?  
I'm raining on the inside  
My heart wells up with tears that start to pour  
I'm raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more  
When friends who care  
Can't be there  
To ease away my pain  
And peace of mind  
It's hard to find  
Like sunlight in the rain  
God sees my heart  
The deepest part  
Inside this lonely me  
And reachin' in  
His love begins  
To heal the heart in me  
I'm raining on the inside  
Oh, my heart wells up with tears that start to pour  
I'm raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more  
Sometimes we're raining on the inside  
And our hearts well up with tears that start to pour  
But when we're raining on the inside  
Let his cries of love break through  
Know that he loves you, once more  
Sometimes I'm raining on the inside  
But then your cries of love break through  
And I fall in love with you once more  

Christopher Robin and I walked along  
Under branches lit up by the moon  
Posing our questions to Owl and Eeyore  
As our days disappeared all too soon  
But I've wandered much further today than I should  
And I can't seem to find my way back to the Wood  
  
So help me if you can  
I've got to get back  
To the House at Pooh Corner by one  
You'd be surprised  
There's so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin and Pooh  
  
Winnie the Pooh doesn't know what to do  
Got a honey jar stuck on his nose  
He came to me asking help and advice  
And from here no one knows where he goes  
So I sent him to ask of the Owl if he's there  
How to loosen a jar from the nose of a bear  
  
It's hard to explain how a few precious things  
Seem to follow throughout all our lives  
After all's said and done I was watching my son  
Sleeping there with my bear by his side  
So I tucked him in, I kissed him and as I was going  
I swear that the old bear whispered "Boy welcome home"  
  
Believe me if you can  
I've finally come back  
To the House at Pooh Corner by one  
What do you know  
There's so much to be done  
Count all the bees in the hive  
Chase all the clouds from the sky  
Back to the days of Christopher Robin  
Back to the ways of Christopher Robin  
Back to the days of Pooh

Hush now, my baby  
Be still love, don't cry.  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream.  
Sleep and remember  
my lullaby.  
And I'll be with you when you dream.  
  
Drift on a river  
that flows through my arms.  
Drift as I'm singing to you.  
I see you smiling  
so peaceful and calm.  
And holding you, I'm smiling too.  
Here in my arms  
safe from all harm.  
Holding you, I'm smiling too.  
  
Hush now, my baby  
Be still love, don't cry.  
Sleep like you're rocked by the stream.  
Sleep and remember this river lullaby.  
And I'll be with you when you dream.  
I'll be with you when you dream.  

Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
  
Let the water and the blood  
From Thy riven side which flowed  
Be of sin the double cure  
Cleanse me from it's guilt and pow'r  
  
Nothing in my hand I bring  
Simply to Thy cross I cling  
Nothing in my hand I bring  
Simply to Thy cross I cling  
  
Naked, come to Thee for dress  
Helpless, look to Thee for grace  
Vile, I to the fountain fly  
Wash me, savior, or I die  
  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee  
Rock of ages, cleft for me  
Let me hide myself in Thee

Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
At the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see  
Every couple tries to stop  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some carolling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear  
Voices singing "Let's be jolly,  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily In the new old fashioned way  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie  
And we'll do some carolling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear  
Voices singing "Let's be jolly,  
Deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree  
Have a happy holiday  
Everyone dancing merrily  
In the new old fashioned way

(Ohhh....)  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,

And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Tell me that time can't erase  
This look of love on your face.  
  
Let me say once more that I need you,  
One more time or just maybe two.  
Oh, my life will always be richer  
For the time I've spent here with you.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Tell me that time won't erase  
The way that my heart sees your face.  
  
I call your name,  
You look my way,  
It's clear you trust each word I say.  
When life is long and problems come,  
You'll always be my only one.  
So now we're standing face to face,  
And with one look your eyes embrace me.  
Squeeze away each haunting fear,  
And say the words I long to hear.  
  
Tell me that time won't erase  
This look of love.  
  
Ohhhh....  
  
Let me say once more.  
I love you.  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
Let me say one time, maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I wish I knew more of you.  
  
Let me say once more that I love you,  
One more time or just maybe two,  
That I love the way that you love me,  
And I want to know more of you.  
  
(I call your name,  
You look my way, I love you.  
It's clear you trust each word I say. I do....  
When life is long and problems come,  
You'll always be my only one.  
So now we're standing face to face, Oh, I need you.  
And with one look your eyes embrace me. I want you.  
Squeeze away each haunting fear, More and more and more.  
And say the words I long to hear.)  
  
(I call your name, Let me say once more  
You look my way, That I love you,  
It's clear you trust each word I say. Let me say one time, maybe two,  
When life is long and problems come, That I love the way that you love

Squeeze away each haunting fear, That I love the way that you love me,  
And say the words I long to hear.) And I wish I knew more of you.

[Chorus:]  
Do you want to be in love forever  
Do you want to make my dream come true  
Let me be the one to kiss and hold you  
Say you'll be my baby  
Can you see the two of us together  
Living in love this whole life through  
Do you want to be in love forever  
Say you'll be mine  
  
I can remember  
When my mind was clear and free  
Now there's a feeling  
Coming over me  
The sweetest attraction  
That my heart has ever seen  
I'm going crazy making sense of anything  
  
(repeat chorus twice)  
  
I really wonder  
Is there magic in your smile  
Taking me under  
Got me acting like a child  
Something about you  
Hits me like avalanche  
I try to stand my ground  
But I don't stand a chance  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Every time I close my eyes I dream about  
Hugging you, holding you, kissing you boy  
It's driving me crazy  
But even if it takes forever  
To win your heart and your love and your devotion  
I know it's gonna be worth the wait  
  
Ooh, say you'll be my baby  
Ooh, be my baby  
Ooh, oh darlin', say you'll be mine  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Do you want to be in love  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Say you'll be my baby  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Do you want to be in love  
Do you want to, do you, do you want to  
Say you'll be mine  
  
(repeat chorus)

[Chorus:]  
I care about you  
I don't want to push you  
Sharayah  
I care about you  
I don't want to lose you now  
I don't want to lose you now  
Come with me...sharayah.  
Sharayah  
Call his name that is all he's asking  
Let him come down to where you are  
You can have life that's everlasting  
Can't you see this is just the start.  
Tell me, tell me, where do you belong  
I guess you've no idea  
Tell me, tell me, where do you come from (yeah)  
Tell me, tell me, why do you pretend to know.  
Listen to me now  
He loves you  
Listen to me now  
He cares for you  
Listen to me now  
He wants you to come home  
(yeah) Sharayah  
(repeat chorus twice)  
Come with me...sharayah  
Come with me...sharayah  
Come with me...sharayah  
Come with me...sharayah  
Sharayah  
Sharayah.

Here under heaven's eyes,  
down under paradise,  
sometimes it seems like we're so small.  
Here on the shores that reach  
into infinity,  
how could we matter much at all?  
Would it be enough  
if each of us would give our love?  
Like sand on a mountain,  
rain on a fountain,  
shade on a shadow,  
a breeze in this tornado,  
just do what you can.  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun.  
We live to learn to love.  
Oh, mercy from above.  
Amazing grace, like rain comes falling down.  
We sing our hearts to you,  
our song of gratitude.  
The voice of ev'ry soul,  
how sweet the sound.  
We can only trust  
all our prayers will all add up.  
Like sand on a mountain,  
rain on a fountain,  
shade on a shadow,  
a breeze in this tornado,  
just do what you can.  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun.  
Would it be enough  
if each of us would give our love?  
Like sand on a mountain,  
rain on a fountain,  
shade on a shadow,  
a breeze in this tornado,  
just do what you can.  
Clap with one hand  
and shine all your light in the sun.

Life can change in the blink of an eye  
You don't know when and you don't know why  
"Forever Young" is a big fat lie  
For the one who lives and the one who dies  
  
I watched my son - shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a full-grown man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and he's buryin' a friend  
Oh, goodbye two boys, hello one man  
  
This son of mine is gonna leave in the fall  
Some might ask how he stands so tall  
His life was changed with a telephone call  
Not even he understands it all  
  
I watched my son - shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a broken man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and he's buryin' a friend  
Oh, goodbye two boys, hello one man  
  
I watched my son - shovel in hand  
Go from bulletproof boy to a full-grown man  
The cool dark dirt on the casket lands  
Nineteen years old and he's buryin' a friend  
Oh, goodbye two boys,  
Oh, goodbye two boys,  
Oh, goodbye my boys

Wake up baby look around  
Birds sing, ooh that sound  
Reminds me of a line  
From "Unchained Melody"  
  
Feel like I'm a little girl  
Best thing in the whole wide world  
Is I can see the makings of a memory  
I remember how it used to be  
Well I'm still dreaming  
  
Cause I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things  
  
Ain't nothing like a sunny day  
Chit-chat at a street cafe  
Just paint the picture, baby  
Where you want to be  
  
Take a walk, take a ride  
So far, you and I  
Don't need a plan  
But we can share  
This revelry  
  
I remember how I used to want it all  
Funny how the big things seem so small  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things  
  
Through all the days  
The blues, the grays  
A ray of light keeps shining  
  
I believe in simple things  
Through all the days  
The blues, the grays  
A ray of light was shining  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
  
I believe in simple things  
  
I dream of simple things  
I can believe in  
Like the feeling this day brings  
True love and the miracle of forgiving  
I believe in simple things

Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing, anew,  
The song your heart first learned to sing when he  
First gave his life, to you,  
The life goes on and so must the song,  
You gotta sing, again,  
The song born in your soul when you  
First gave your heart, to him,  
Sing his praises, once more  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing, aloud,  
The song that someone is dying to hear  
Down in the madd'ning crowd,  
As you once were before your heard the song,  
You gotta let them know,  
The truth is a life to shine upon the way,  
So maybe they, can go,  
Sing his praises, once more  
  
Sing your praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to let the name of the Lord,  
Be praise, both for now, and evermore,  
Praise him all ye servants,  
  
Give him praise to the Lord,  
Come on everybody,  
Stand up and sing, one more  
Hallelujah,  
Give your praise to the Lord,  
I can never tell you,  
Just how much good, that it's  
Gonna do ya  
  
Just to sing, sing sing,  
Come on, sing, sing, sing,  
I can hear you now, sing, sing, sing,

Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside, the snow is falling, and friends are calling, "yoo-hoo!"  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap, let's go  
Let's look at the show  
We're riding in a wonderland of snow  
Giddy-yap, giddy-yap, giddy-yap  
It's grand just holding your hand  
We're gliding along with a song of a wintery fairyland  
Our cheeks are nice and rosy, and comfy-cozy are we  
We're snuggled up together like two birds of a feather would be  
Let's take that road before us and sing a chorus or two  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
There's a birthday party at the home of Farmer Gray  
It'll be the perfect ending of a perfect day  
We'll be singing the songs we love to sing without a single stop  
At the fireplace while we watch the chestnuts pop, pop, pop, pop!  
There's a happy feeling nothing in the world can buy  
When they pass around the coffee and the pumpkin pie  
It'll nearly be like a picture print by Currier and Ives  
These wonderful things are the things we remember all through our lives!  
Just hear those sleigh bells jingling, ring-ting-tingling, too  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you  
Outside, the snow is falling, and friends are calling, "yoo-hoo!"  
Come on, it's lovely weather for a sleigh ride together with you

So much pain and no good reason why  
You've cried until the tears run dry  
And nothing here can make you understand  
The one thing that you held so dear  
Is slipping from your hands  
And you say  
  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
Why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
  
[Chorus]  
Somewhere down the road  
There'll be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
Somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
And they will hold the answers at the end of the road  
  
Yesterday I thought I'd seen it all  
I thought I'd climbed the highest wall  
Now I see the learning never ends  
And all I know to do is keep on walking  
Walking 'round the bend, saying  
  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
And why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, keep on walkin' now  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
And why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
All I know to say now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, they will hold the answers at the end of the road  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Oh, keep on walkin' now  
Ooh  
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh  
Ooh walkin' down the road  
Walkin' down the road  
Somewhere down this lonely road  
Can't see it now  
Down the lonely road  
Somewhere down the lonely road

Standing in our silence  
I hear my heart beating  
And if only I could choose  
I'd stay here with you  
But hold me till the train is leaving  
  
Somewhere down the line  
After you've gone from sight  
Our love will be the same  
And, whispering your name,  
I'll cling to you with all my might  
  
Let me dream of you  
But it's true  
And wake me up when this is over  
Love will be there when this is over and  
  
Chorus:  
Somewhere far beyond today  
I will find a way to find you  
And somehow thru the lonely nights  
I will leave a light in the dark  
Let it lead you to my heart  
  
There's a love inside us  
Deep down inside  
That goes without saying  
Don't say a word  
But I'll tell you just the same  
And that love will fan the flame  
And that flame will warm the heart that's waiting  
  
You are mine and I'll wait for you my love  
You are mine it may take some time  
Even if it takes a lifetime  
Tell me you'll wait  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge:  
And somewhere alone  
I will be praying you home  
I know that somewhere our love  
  
Our love will lead me to your arms  
  
Chorus

Long time since I've seen your smile  
But when I close my eyes  
I remember  
You were no more than a child  
But then so was I  
Young and tender  
Time carries on  
I guess it always will  
But deep inside my heart  
Time stands still  
Stay for awhile  
Well, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
Stay for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
For a moment it can seem  
Just the way it used to be  
Snowfalls, phone calls, broken hearts  
Clear summer days  
Warm and lazy  
Long walks, long talks, after dark  
We vowed we'd never forget  
Now it's hazy  
Time takes its toll  
And time alters our view  
It would be nice to  
Spend some time with you  
Oh, stay for awhile  
Well, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
(oohhh) stay for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
For a moment it can seem  
Just the way it used to be  
Stay...  
(please stay)  
Stay, stay, stay...  
One, two, one, two  
Stay for awhile  
Well, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
(oohhh) stay for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
Just the way it used to be  
Stay for awhile  
Oh, it's good to see your smile  
And I love your company  
Won't you stay with me for awhile  
And remember the days gone by  
For a moment it can seem  
Just the way it used to be  
(the way it used to be. be...  
The way it used to be, ooohhhh, aahhhh ooooh  
Now, now, now, now...hoohhh...)

Like it or not  
Life is ours for the living  
Only one shot  
What's the advice you're getting?  
  
Work hard in school  
Learn the good rule and  
Try to make good for you  
No one could see  
Hanging within the balance  
Helpless me  
  
I only want help to hear me  
Evil and light  
Caught in a fight  
They're trying to capture me  
But you cared about me now  
Now and forever!  
  
[Chorus:]  
There'll never be anyone  
Who can take the place of you  
There'll never be anyone  
Stepping in your shoes  
There'll never be anyone  
Giving it all to pull me through  
There'll never be anyone, (there'll never be anyone)  
Stepping in your shoes  
  
Only through you  
Sin on innocent shoulders  
Could you undo  
Darkness' power to hold us  
Once for all time  
Choosing to die  
I'll never deserve you  
And you cared about me now  
Now and forever!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh....  
Oh....  
There will never be anyone  
Stepping in your shoes  
There will never be anyone  
Stepping in your shoes  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 3X]

Day by day, dream by dream.  
I fight to find the way to go.  
Every day opens a different door.  
Every dream shadows the one before.  
  
But slowly I can see  
The way you've made for me.  
Straight ahead, I can see your light.  
Straight ahead, through the dark.  
Straight ahead, there's no left or right.  
Straight ahead, to your heart.  
  
Carry on through the night,  
When the road is hard to find.  
Lying lights tell me to turn around.  
Lying thoughts tell me I'm lost not found.  
But clearly I can see  
You're waiting there for me.  
  
Straight ahead, I can see your light.  
Straight ahead, through the dark.  
Straight ahead, there's no left or right.  
Straight ahead, to your heart.  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead),  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead),  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead),  
Straight ahead, (straight ahead).  
  
Straight ahead (straight ahead), I can see your light.  
Straight ahead, through the dark (through the dark).  
Straight ahead, there's no left or right.  
Straight ahead, to your heart.  
Straight ahead

[Chorus]  
It takes a little time sometimes  
To get your feet back on the ground  
It takes a little time sometimes  
To get the titanic turned back around  
It takes a little time sometimes  
But baby you're not going down  
It takes more than you've got right now  
Give it time  
  
What's this walking through' my door  
I know I've seen the look before  
Sometimes in faces on the street  
Sometimes in the mirror looking back at me  
You can't fix this pain with money  
You can't rush a weary soul  
You can't sweep it under the rug, now honey  
It don't take a lot to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now it may not be over by morning  
But Rome wasn't built in a day  
You can name this thing a thousand times  
But it won't make it go away  
Let me put my arms around you  
And hold you while you weep  
We've been talking and talking  
I'm sick of this talk  
And it's nothing that won't keep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No you can't fix this pain with money  
You can't rush a weary soul  
You can't sweep it under the rug now honey  
It don't take a lot to know  
  
[Chorus]

There are burdens that I carry everyday  
Sometimes they make me want to cry  
Hopeless feelings harbored deep inside my heart  
And I find it hard to hold my head up high  
In the middle of the darkness in my life  
I find a strength to carry on  
I am holding to a promise Jesus made  
And I know it won't be long 'til we'll be gone  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
If you feel there is no meaning in your life  
And it seems you've lost your way  
Listen closely to the voice that's deep inside  
And remember what the Savior has to say  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
In a while we'll be gone  
And we won't have to cry anymore  
All our sorrows left behind  
And that's the day that I am waiting for  
And that's the day that I am longing for  
And that's the day that I am looking for  

Sometimes we make it harder than it is  
We'll take a perfect night  
And fill it up with words we don't mean  
Dark sides best unseen  
And we wonder why we're feeling this way.  
  
Sometimes i wonder if we really feel the same  
Why we can be unkind  
Questioning the strongest of hearts  
That's when we must start  
Believing in the one thing that has gotten us this far.  
  
That's what love is for  
To help us through it  
That's what love if for  
Nothing else can do it.  
  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby, that's what love is for.  
  
Sometimes i see you  
And you don't know i am there  
And i'm washed away by emotions  
I hold deep down inside  
Getting stronger with time  
It's living through the fire  
And holding on we find  
  
That's what love is for  
To help us through it  
That's what love if for  
Nothing else can do it.  
  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby, that's what love is for.  
  
Believing in the one thing  
That has gotten us this far  
That's what love is for  
To help us through it  
That's what love if for  
Nothing else can do it.  
  
Round off the edges  
Talk us down from the ledges  
Give us strength to try once more  
Baby, that's what love is for  
That's what love if for.  
  
That's what love if for  
Melt our defenses  
Bring us back to our senses  
Give us strength to try once more  
  
Baby, that's what love is for.  
That's what love if for.  
That's what love if for.  
That's what love if for.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's bringing lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
And so I'm offering this simple wish  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you  
  
They know that Santa's on his way

To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas, Merry Christmas to you

I cannot take the heat  
This girl's going home  
Standing on my own two feet  
Standing alone  
I'm just a little weary of  
All the talk and all the buzz  
And all I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with us  
I cannot take the heat  
I guess I'm letting go  
I'm tired of stitching up my dreams with  
This thread of hope  
I'm still a believer of  
Twin hearts and timeless love  
And all I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with us  
All I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with us  
The road of life is rugged  
Any road you choose  
And when I find the other side  
I'll look for you  
But I cannot take the heat  
And so I'll say goodbye  
A million things I never said  
Didn't even try  
'cause words are cheap and sometimes cruel  
And stuff you hear is seldom true  
And all I ever wanted was  
The feeling I had with you  
Yeah, all I ever wanted was,  
The feeling I had with you  

Children carry through the streets  
A brightly painted star.  
Angels gather round the hearth,  
Strumming on guitars.  
Men of great renown and faith  
Say prayers on boulevards.  
It's the night before christmas.  
  
But you don't have to be an angel  
To sing harmony.  
You don't have to be a child  
To love the mystery. (mystery)  
And you don't have to be a wise man  
On bended knee.  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me.  
  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night before christmas.)  
  
If your heart's been longing,  
You've been afraid to try,  
Sorrow's kept you company,  
And the dance has passed by,  
I'll lift you up and blaze with you  
Across the moonlit sky  
On the night before christmas.  
  
'cause you don't have to be an angel  
To sing harmony.  
You don't have to be a child  
To love the mystery. (mystery)  
And you don't have to be a wise man  
On bended knee.  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me.  
  
The heart of this christmas is in you and me.  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night before christmas.)  
(the night) the night before christmas.  
(the night) la, la, la, la

There will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
And I know that there will never be another love  
Who could ever be the love that You are  
'Cause You had so much to lose  
But still You gave it up for Your scars  
But that's the way You are  
And if I spent my life attending Universities  
Educated in the wisdom of men  
And if I could even quote a guy like Socrates  
Even then I couldn't comprehend  
That there will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
And I know I'll never understand the mystery  
If I live to be a hundred and three  
How You died to live the love You give to me  
There will never be another  
Who will love me like You  
There will never be another  
Who could hold me, mold me  
There will never be another  
Who could love me purely  
No, there will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  
There will never be another  
Who has loved me like You  

This is my father's world  
And to my listening ears  
All nature sings, and round me rings  
The music of the spheres  
This is my father's world  
The birds their carols raise  
The morning light, the lily white  
Declare their maker's praise  
This is my father's world  
I rest me in the thought  
Of rocks and trees, of skies and seas  
His hand the wonders wrought  
This is my father's world  
Oh, let me never forget  
That though the wrong seems oft so strong  
God is the ruler yet  
This is my father's world  
Why should my heart be sad?  
The Lord is king, let the heavens ring  
God reigns, let the earth be glad  
This is my father's world  
He shines in all that's fair  
In the rustling grass, I hear him pass  
He speaks to me everywhere  
In the rustling grass, I hear him pass  
He speaks to me everywhere  

Come and gather around at the table  
In the spirit of family and friends  
And we'll all join hands and remember this moment  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
Let's all try to smile for the picture  
And we'll hold it as long as we can  
May it carry us through  
Should we ever get lonely  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
[Chorus:]  
One night holy and bright  
Shining with love from our hearts  
By a warm fire,  
Let's lift our heads high  
And be thankful we're here  
'Til this time next year  
  
May the new year be blessed  
With good tidings  
'Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
'Til the season comes 'round again  
  
[Chorus]  
May the new year be blessed with good tidings  
'Til the next time I see you again  
If we must say goodbye  
Let the spirit go with you  
And we'll love and we'll laugh  
In the time that we had  
'Til the season comes 'round again
