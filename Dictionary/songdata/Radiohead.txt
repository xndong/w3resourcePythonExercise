[Chorus]  
And in your life, there comes a darkness  
There's a spacecraft blocking out the sky  
And there's nowhere to hide  
You run to the back and you cover your ears  
But it's the loudest sound you've ever heard  
Are we trapped? Rag doll cloth people  
We are helpless to resist  
In your darkest hour  
  
[Verse]  
But it was just a laugh, just a lie  
Just a laugh, just a laugh  
Even at this angle  
And so we crumble  
A 10-ton head, made of wet sand  
Oh this dread circumference  
You gotta be kidding me  
The grass grows over me  
Your face in the glass, in the glass  
It was just a laugh, just a laugh  
It's whatever you say it is  
Split infinities  
  
[Chorus]  
Then into your life, there comes a darkness  
And a spacecraft blocking out the sky  
And there's nowhere to hide  
You run to the back and you cover your ears  
It's the loudest sound you've ever heard  
In your darkest hour  
  
[Outro]  
Have you had enough of me?  
Have you had enough of me?  
Sweet time  
Have you had enough of me?  
Have you had enough of me?  
Sweet time  
Sweet time  
Sweet time  
Sweet time

You there  
Get up on that wall  
Get up on that  
Who? Who? you (fool) you, you (fool) you, you  
Toodaloo  
You fool

Fitter, happier, more productive,  
Comfortable,  
Not drinking too much,  
Regular exercise at the gym  
(Three days a week),  
Getting on better with your associate employee contemporaries,  
At ease,  
Eating well  
(No more microwave dinners and saturated fats),  
A patient better driver,  
A safer car  
(Baby smiling in back seat),  
Sleeping well  
(No bad dreams),  
No paranoia,  
Careful to all animals  
(Never washing spiders down the plughole),  
Keep in contact with old friends  
(Enjoy a drink now and then),  
Will frequently check credit at (moral) bank (hole in the wall),  
Favors for favors,  
Fond but not in love,  
Charity standing orders,  
On Sundays ring road supermarket  
(No killing moths or putting boiling water on the ants),  
Car wash  
(Also on Sundays),  
No longer afraid of the dark or midday shadows  
Nothing so ridiculously teenage and desperate,  
Nothing so childish, at a better pace,  
Slower and more calculated,  
No chance of escape,  
Now self-employed,  
Concerned (but powerless),  
An empowered and informed member of society  
(Pragmatism not idealism),  
Will not cry in public,  
Less chance of illness,  
Tires that grip in the wet  
(Shot of baby strapped in back seat),  
A good memory,  
Still cries at a good film,  
Still kisses with saliva,  
No longer empty and frantic like a cat tied to a stick,  
That's driven into frozen winter shit  
(The ability to laugh at weakness),  
Calm,  
Fitter,  
Healthier and more productive  
A pig in a cage on antibiotics.

Two jumps and a week  
I bet you think that's pretty clever, don't you boy  
Flying on your motorcycle  
Watching all the ground beneath you drop  
  
Kill yourself for recognition  
Kill yourself to never ever stop  
You broke another mirror  
You're turning into something you are not  
  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
  
Drying up in conversation  
You will be the one who cannot talk  
All your insides fall to pieces  
You just sit there wishing you could still make love  
  
They're the ones who'll hate you  
When you think you've got the world all sussed out  
They're the ones who'll spit at you  
You'll be the one screaming out  
  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
  
It's the best thing that you ever had,  
The best thing you ever, ever had  
It's the best thing that you ever had,  
The best thing you have had is gone away  
  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry  
Don't leave me high,  
Don't leave me high, don't leave me dry

Seen all good things and bad  
Running down the hill  
All so  
Battered and  
Brought to the ground  
I am hungry again  
I am drunk again  
With all the money I owe to my friends  
  
When I'm like this how can you be smiling  
Saying  
How can you be sure?  
How can you be sure?  
  
If you walk out the door  
Will I see you again?  
If so much of me lies in your eyes  
I am hungry again  
I am drunk again  
With all the money I owe to my friends  
  
When I'm like this how can you be smiling  
Saying  
How can you be sure?  
(I don't want you anymore)  
How can you be sure?  
(I don't want you anymore)  
How can you be sure?  
(I don't want you anymore)  
How can you be sure?  
  
I don't want you  
I don't want you anymore  
I don't want you  
I don't want you anymore

He's bitter and twisted, he knows what he wants.  
He wants to be loved and he wants to belong.  
He wants you to listen, he wants us to weep.  
And he was a stupid baby who turned into a powerful freak.  
  
But how do you?  
How do you?  
How do you?  
  
He lives with his mother, but we show him respect.  
He's a dangerous bigot, but we always forget.  
And he's just like his daddy, 'cause he cheats on his friends.  
And he steals and he bullies, any way that he can.  
  
But how do you?  
How do you?  
How do you

That there  
That's not me  
I go  
Where I please  
  
I walk through walls  
I float down the Liffey  
I'm not here  
This isn't happening  
I'm not here  
I'm not here  
  
In a little while  
I'll be gone  
The moment's already passed  
Yeah it's gone  
And I'm not here  
This isn't happening  
I'm not here  
I'm not here  
  
Strobe lights and blown speakers  
Fireworks and hurricanes  
I'm not here  
This isn't happening  
I'm not here  
I'm not here

Please forget the words that I just blurted out  
It wasn't me, it was a strange and creeping doubt  
It keeps rattling my cage  
There's nothing in this world will keep it down  
  
Even though I might,  
Even though I try,  
I can't  
  
So many things that keep, keep me underground  
So many words that I, that I can never find  
  
If you give up on me now,  
I'll be gutted like I've never been before  
  
Even though I might,  
Even though I try,  
I can't

I won't run away no more, I promise  
Even when I get bored, I promise  
Even when you lock me out, I promise  
I say my prayers every night, I promise  
I don't wish that I'm strict, I promise  
The tantrums and the chilling chats, I promise  
Even when the ship is wrecked, I promise  
Tie me to the rotten deck, I promise  
I won't fool around no more, I promise  
Even when I get bored, I promise  
Even when you lock me out, I promise  
I say my prayers every night, I promise  
I won't fool around no more, I promise

Who's in a bunker?  
Who's in a bunker?  
Women and children first  
And the children first  
And the children  
  
I'll laugh until my head comes off  
I'll swallow till I burst  
Until I burst  
Until I  
  
Who's in a bunker?  
Who's in a bunker?  
I have seen too much  
I haven't seen enough  
You haven't seen it  
  
I'll laugh until my head comes off  
Women and children first  
And children first  
And children  
  
Here I'm alive  
Everything all of the time  
Here I'm alive  
Everything all of the time  
  
Ice age coming  
Ice age coming  
Let me hear both sides  
Let me hear both sides  
Let me hear both  
  
Ice age coming  
Ice age coming  
Throw it in the fire  
Throw it in the fire  
Throw it on the  
  
We're not scaremongering  
This is really happening  
Happening  
We're not scaremongering  
This is really happening  
Happening  
  
Mobiles squerking  
Mobiles chirping  
Take the money run  
Take the money run  
Take the money  
  
Here I'm alive  
Everything all of the time  
Here I'm alive  
Everything all of the time  
  
Here I'm alive  
Everything all of the time  
Here I'm alive  
Everything all of the time  
  
The first of the children [Repeat until fade]

I hate these flaming curtains they're not the color of your hair  
I hate these striplights they're not so undoing as your stare  
I hate the buttons on your shirt when all I wanna do is tear  
I hate this bloody big bed of mine when you're not here  
[chorus]  
Well I finally found someone to turn me upside down  
And nail my feet up where my head should be  
If they had a King of Fools then I could wear that crown  
And you can all die laughing because I'll wear it proudly  
Well you seem to be shivering dear and the room is awfully warm  
In the white and scarlet billows that subside beyond the storm  
You have this expression dear no words could take its place  
And I wear it like a badge that you put all over my face  
[chorus]  
I'll wear it proudly through the dives and the dancehalls  
If you'll wear it proudly through the snakepits and catcalls  
Like a fifteen year old kid wears a vampire kiss  
If you don't know what is wrong with me  
Then you don't know what you've missed  
We are arms and legs wrapped round more than my memory tonight  
When the bell rang out and the air outside turned blue from fright  
But in shameless moments you made more of me than just a mess  
And a handful of eagerness says "What do you suggest?"  
[chorus

Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I can't read  
Another message I can't read  
  
Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I can't read  
Another message I can't read  
  
I'm on your side  
Nowhere to hide  
Trapdoors that open  
I spiral down  
  
You're living in a fantasy  
You're living in a fantasy  
  
I'm lost at sea  
Don't bother me  
I've lost my way  
I've lost my way  
  
You're living in a fantasy  
You're living in a fantasy  
You're living in a fantasy  
This beautiful world  
  
Being the first in the Irish Sea  
I got a message I can't read  
Another message I can't read

What do you want from me?  
Now you got me  
Now my fingers bleed  
Now they're staring at me  
I'm a coward now  
I hold my peace  
  
Now you tie me up to your feather bed  
And I twist and turn in a Chinese burn  
You won't let go  
You won't let go  
  
You're inside my head  
Inside my head  
  
What do you want from me?  
Now you got me  
Now my energy you suck from me  
And I'm holding on for dear life  
  
Quit smothering me  
Quit laughing at me  
I've got a disease  
An English disease  
It won't let go  
It won't let go  
  
You're inside my head  
Inside my head  
  
What did you put in that syringe?  
Whatever you really said to him?  
Is sitting there, inside of me  
  
And you bother me  
You possess me  
You're there again  
Ahead of me  
And I won't let go  
I won't let go  
  
You're inside my head  
Inside my head  
Inside my head  
Inside my head

I've seen it all, I have seen the trees,  
I've seen the willow leaves dancing in the breeze  
I've seen a friend killed by a friend,  
And lives that were over before they were spent.  
I've seen what I was - I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all - there is no more to see!  
You haven't seen elephants, kings or Peru!  
I'm happy to say I had better to do  
What about China? Have you seen the Great Wall?  
All walls are great, if the roof doesn't fall!  
  
And the man you will marry?  
The home you will share?  
To be honest, I really don't care...  
  
You've never been to Niagara Falls?  
I have seen water, its water, that's all...  
The Eiffel Tower, the Empire State?  
My pulse was as high on my very first date!  
Your grandson's hand as he plays with your hair?  
To be honest, I really don't care...  
  
I've seen it all, I've seen the dark  
I've seen the brightness in one little spark.  
I've seen what I chose and I've seen what I need,  
And that is enough, to want more would be greed.  
I've seen what I was and I know what I'll be  
I've seen it all - there is no more to see!  
  
You've seen it all and all you have seen  
You can always review on your own little screen  
The light and the dark, the big and the small  
Just keep in mind - you need no more at all  
You've seen what you were and know what you'll be  
You've seen it all - there is no more to see!

Can't get the stink off,  
He's been hanging around for days  
Comes like a comet,  
Suckered you but not your friends  
  
One day he'll get to you,  
Teach you how to be a holy cow  
  
[Chorus]  
You do it to yourself you do  
And that's what really hurts is  
You do it to yourself just you,  
You and no-one else  
You do it to yourself  
You do it to yourself  
  
Don't get my sympathy hanging out the 15th floor  
You've changed the locks 3 times,  
He still comes reeling through the door  
One day I will get to you  
And Teach you how to get to purest hell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]

Karma police  
Arrest this man  
He talks in maths  
He buzzes like a fridge  
He's like a detuned radio  
  
Karma police  
Arrest this girl  
Her Hitler hairdo  
Is making me feel ill  
And we have crashed her party  
  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
When you mess with us  
  
Karma police  
I've given all I can  
It's not enough  
I've given all I can  
But we're still on the payroll  
  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
This is what you'll get  
When you mess with us  
  
For a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself  
Phew, for a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself  
  
For a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself  
Phew, for a minute there  
I lost myself, I lost myself

Too hard on the brakes again  
What if these brakes just give in?  
What if they don't get out of the way?  
What if there's someone overtaking?  
I'm going out for a little drive  
And it could be the last time you see me alive  
There could be an idiot on the road  
The only kick in life is pumping his steel  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
They won't ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive  
  
Don't die on the motorway  
The moon would freeze, the plants would die  
I couldn't cope if you crashed today  
All the things I forgot to say  
I'm going out for a little drive  
And it could be the last time you see me alive  
What if the car loses control?  
What if there's someone overtaking?  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
They won't ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive killer cars  
  
Wrap me up in the back of the trunk  
Packed with foam and blind drunk  
No they won't ever take me alive  
Cause they all drive killer cars  
They all drive killer cars  
They all drive killer cars

Appliances have gone berserk  
I cannot keep up  
Treading on people's toes  
Snot-nosed little punk  
  
And I can't face the evening straight  
And you can't offer me escape  
Houses move and houses speak  
If you take me there you'll get relief  
Believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
And if I'm gonna talk  
I just wanna talk  
Please don't interrupt  
Just sit back and listen  
  
Cause I can't face the evening straight  
And you can't offer me escape  
Houses move and houses speak  
If you take me there you'll get relief  
Believe, believe, believe, believe  
  
It's too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much  
Too bright  
Too powerful  
  
Too much

Once again I'm in trouble with my only friend  
She is papering the window panes  
She is putting on a smile  
Living in a glass house  
  
Once again packed like frozen food and battery hens  
Think of all the starving millions  
Don't talk politics and don't throw stones  
Your royal highness's  
  
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat  
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat  
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat  
But someone's listening in  
  
Once again we are hungry for a lynching  
That's a strange mistake to make  
You should turn the other cheek  
Living in a glass house  
  
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat  
Well of course I'd like to stay and chew the fat  
Well of course I'd like to sit around and chat  
Only only only only only only only only only only...  
There's someone listening in

This is the place  
Sit down, you're safe now  
You've been stuck in a lift  
We've been trying to reach you, Thom  
  
This is the place  
It won't hurt, it will not hurt  
  
A smell of recognition  
A face you barely loved  
Empty all your pockets  
'Cause it's time to go home  
  
This is the place  
Remembering all the things you always see  
  
You've been stuck in a lift  
In the belly of a whale  
At the bottom of the ocean  
  
A smell of recognition  
A face you barely loved  
Empty all your pockets  
'Cause it's time to go home  
  
Today is the first day of the rest of your days  
So lighten up, squirt

Turn to nasty now  
The dark cell  
The pillar of my soul  
The last one out of the box  
The one who broke this spell  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
I'm such a tease  
And you're such a flirt  
Once you've been hurt  
You've been around enough  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
Never get earnest  
Never get judged  
I'm no idiot  
I should look  
  
Your clue on hold, snapped up  
Crawling with my love  
The last one out of the box  
The one that broke the seal  
  
Obligation  
Complication  
Routines and schedules  
Drug and kill you  
Kill you  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
Never get nervous  
Never get judged  
I'm no idiot  
I should look  
  
Little by little by hook or by crook  
I'm such a tease  
And you're such a flirt

I'm on a roll,  
I'm on a roll to success  
I feel my luck could change  
  
Kill me Sarah,  
Kill me again with love,  
It's gonna be a glorious day  
  
Pull me out of the aircrash,  
Pull me out of the lake,  
'Cause I'm your superhero,  
We are standing on the edge  
  
The head of state has called for me by name  
But I don't have time for him  
It's gonna be a glorious day  
I feel my luck could change  
  
Pull me out of the aircrash,  
Pull me out of the lake,  
'Cause I'm your superhero,  
We are standing on the edge  
  
We are standing on the edge

You stop the crowd  
I cried out to break the spell  
You wake and smile  
I just snapped and lost control  
  
Distracted by irrelevance  
The stress and the tension  
The stress and the tension  
I'm in a lull  
  
There's nothing more dull  
Then talking about yourself  
But what I meant to say  
I'm sorry that I lost control  
  
Distracted by irrelevance  
The stress and the tension  
Crawling through the keyhole  
I'm in a lull

Here it comes, Here it comes,  
I can feel the hills exploding  
Exploding gracefully  
Burning up the freeway  
Here it comes  
Grass is green at the edge of the bubble  
Beautiful gets into beautiful trouble  
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you.  
Oh baby burn  
  
Fast die younger  
Burns rubber  
Useless rockers  
From England  
Good times  
Had by all  
Just swallow your guilt and your crutches  
Blue and white birds stop and hide on the pedal  
Interstate fire walk staright down the middle,  
And it seems to fall out of the sky and come down on you  
Oh baby burn

You got some nerve coming here  
You got some nerve coming here  
You stole it all  
Give it back  
You stole it all  
Give it back  
  
Good morning, Mr. Magpie  
How are we today?  
Now you've stolen all the magic  
I turn my back, walk away  
  
You know you should  
But you don't  
You know you should  
But you don't  
  
Good morning, Mr. Magpie  
How are we today?  
Now you've stolen all the magic  
Took my melody

Red wine and sleeping pills  
Help me get back to your arms  
Cheap sex and sad films  
Help me get where I belong  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
Stop sending letters  
Letters always get burned  
It's not like the movies  
They fed us on little white lies  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I will see you in the next life  
Beautiful angel  
Pulled apart at birth  
Limbless and helpless  
I can't even recognize you  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I think you're crazy, maybe  
I will see you in the next life

After years of waiting nothing came  
As your life flashed before your eyes  
You realize  
  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off, get off, get off my case (x2)  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case  
Get off my case  
  
After years of waiting  
After years of waiting nothing came  
And you realize you're looking,  
Looking in the wrong place  
  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case (x2)  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case (x2)  
I'm a reasonable man  
Get off my case (x3)  
  
After years of waiting  
You're a reasonable man  
Get off our case (x3)  
I'm a reasonable man,  
Get off my case (x3)  
  
I'm a reasonable man,  
Get off my case (x3)  
I'm a reasonable man,  
Get off my case (x3)

In a city of the future  
It is difficult to concentrate  
Meet the boss, meet the wife  
Everybody's happy  
Everyone is made for life  
  
In a city of the future  
It is difficult to find a space  
I'm too busy to see you  
You're too busy to wait  
  
But I'm okay, how are you?  
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking  
But I'm okay, how are you?  
I hope you're okay too  
  
Everyone one of those days  
When the sky's California blue  
With a beautiful bombshell  
I throw myself into my work  
I'm too lazy, I've been kidding myself for so long  
  
I'm okay, how are you?  
Thanks for asking, thanks for asking  
But I'm okay, how are you?  
I hope you're okay too

Please could you stop the noise,  
I'm trying to get some rest  
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head  
What's that?  
What's that?  
  
When I am king, you will be first against the wall  
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all  
What's that?  
What's that?  
  
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly  
Kicking and squealing Gucci little piggy  
You don't remember  
You don't remember  
Why don't you remember my name?  
Off with his head, man  
Off with his head, man  
Why don't you remember my name?  
I guess he does  
  
Rain down, rain down  
Come on rain down on me  
From a great height  
From a great height, height  
Rain down, rain down  
Come on rain down on me  
From a great height  
From a great height, height,  
Rain down, rain down  
Come on rain down on me  
  
That's it, sir  
You're leaving  
The crackle of pigskin  
The dust and the screaming  
The yuppies networking  
The panic, the vomit  
The panic, the vomit  
God loves his children,  
God loves his children, yeah!

How'd you get your teeth so pearly?  
Dew-drop dentures  
White-washed faces  
She runs from the third world, pearly  
  
Vanilla (feel it crawl to me)  
Milkshakes (crawl back again)  
From Hard Rock (whatever you say)  
Cafes (it won't go away)  
That's where (I feel it crawl to me)  
She got her (crawls back again)  
Sweet tooth (it won't go away)  
For white boys (whatever you say)  
  
She runs from the third world, pearly  
  
Hurts me  
Darling hurts me  
Darling hurts me  
Darling hurts me

I got wings, I got arms, I got shrinks  
I got bombs, I got guns, I got brains  
So there's no point in your warbird  
She's no point in denying  
I got guns, I got bombs, I got brains  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
Take me up to a warmer place  
I got eggs, I got feathers, I got brains  
And there's no point in your warbird  
She's no point in denying  
I got guns, I got bombs, I got brains  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
For you, for you  
Or you  
I got brains, I got feathers, I got hands  
I got friends, I got ammo, I got plans  
So there's no point in your warbird  
She's no point in denying  
I got guns, I got arms, I got plans  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fall for you  
And I won't fly for you

Go.  
Disjointed we scare ourselves with all that we wanna be.  
Just got paid and now you're going, how long should you be?  
If I get scared, I just call you.  
And I, miss your glow as I unsettle,  
Oh I'll always feel, I'll always be.  
Right.  
  
One, two, three, four.  
  
So sell your suit and tie, and come and live with me.  
Leukemia, schizophrenia, polyethylene.  
There is no significant risk to your health.  
She used to be beautiful once as well.  
  
Plastic bag, middle class, polyethylene.  
Decaffeinate, unleaded, keep all surfaces clean.  
If you don't believe in it, sell your soul.  
If you don't get into it, no one will.  
Oh...... Oh........

This dance  
This dance  
It's like a weapon  
Like a weapon  
Of self defense  
Self defense  
Against the present  
Against the present  
Present tense  
  
I won't get heavy  
Don't get heavy  
Keep it light and  
Keep it moving  
I am doing  
No harm  
As my world  
Comes crashing down  
I'm dancing  
Freaking out  
Deaf, dumb, and blind  
  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost  
  
I won't turn around when the penny drops  
I won't stop now  
I won't slack off  
Or all this love  
Will be in vain  
  
Stop from falling  
Down a mine  
It's no one's business but mine  
That all this love  
Could be in vain  
  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost

I jumped in the river, what did I see?  
Black-eyed angels swam with me  
A moon full of stars and astral cars  
And all the figures I used to see  
  
All my lovers were there with me  
All my past and futures  
And we all went to heaven in a little row boat  
There was nothing to fear and nothing to doubt

Thom Yorke:  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Scared of the spotlight  
You don't come to visit  
I'm stuck in this bed  
  
Thin rubber gloves  
She laughs when she's crying  
She cries when she's laughing  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
(Away.... Away.... Away....)  
  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
Washed down the toilet  
Money to burn  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away...  
  
Sample from movie Jacob's Ladder:  
If you're frightened of dyin' and you're holding on...  
You'll see devils tearing your life away.  
But... If you've made your peace,  
Then the devils are really angels  
Freeing you from the earth..... From the earth.... From the earth  
  
White worms on the underground  
Caught between stations  
Butterfingers  
I'm losing my patience  
  
I'm a rabbit in your headlights  
Christian suburbanite  
You got money to burn....  
  
Fat bloody fingers are sucking your soul away.....  
Away, away, away,  
Away, away, away.

I've been walking these streets so long  
singing the same old song  
I know every crack in these dirty sidewalks of Broadway  
where hustle's the name of the game  
and nice guys get washed away like the snow and the rain  
there's been a load of compromising  
on the road to my horizon  
but I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse  
in a star spangled rodeo  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I don't even know  
and offers coming over the phone  
well I really don't mind the rain  
and a smile can hide all the pain  
but you're down when you're riding the train  
that's taking the long way  
and I dream of the things I'll do  
with a subway token and a dollar tucked inside my shoe  
there'll be a load of compromising  
on the road to my horizon  
but I'm gonna be where the lights are shining on me  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo  
rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I don't even know  
and offers coming over the phone  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
riding out on a horse in a star spangled rodeo  
like a rhinestone cowboy  
getting cards and letters from people I don't even know  
like a rhinestone cowboy

Soul destroyed with clever toys for little boys  
It's inevitable, inevitable, it's a soul destroyed  
You feel it till you're dry  
You feel it till you've had enough  
And you don't understand  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
  
Aeroplane, do I mean what I mean  
It's inevitable, inevitable, oh aeroplane  
  
A thousand miles an hour  
On politics and power  
That you don't understand  
  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
  
La la la la...  
  
The answer to your prayers  
We'll drop you anywhere  
  
No Ripcord, no ripcord  
No Ripcord, no ripcord

I'm walking out in a force-ten gale  
Birds thrown around, bullets for hail  
The roof is pulling off by its fingernails  
Your voice is rapping on my window-sill  
  
Yesterday's headlines blown by the wind  
Yesterday's people in a scatterbrain  
Any fool can easy pick a hole  
(I wish I could fall in)  
A moving target in a firing range  
  
Somewhere I'm not  
Scatterbrain  
Somewhere I'm not  
Scatterbrain  
Lightning fuse, powercut  
Scatterbrain

It's like I'm fallen out of bed  
From a long, weary dream  
The sweetest flowers and fruits are hanging from trees  
Falling off the giant bird that's been carrying me  
It's like I've fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Just exactly as I remember  
Every word  
Every gesture  
  
And my heart, in my mouth  
Like I'm fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying  
  
And as that woman blows her cover  
In the eye of the beholder  
I'm a fish now out of water  
Falling off a giant bird that's been carrying me  
  
I fell open  
I laid under  
At the tip out  
I was just your number  
I want stay on it  
And get back under  
  
And if you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
If you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
If you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
  
(Wake me up, wake me up)  
If you think this is over  
Then you're wrong  
(Wake me up, wake me up)  
Like I'm fallen out of bed  
From a long and vivid dream  
Finally I'm free of all the weight I've been carrying  
  
When at last you'll give in  
When at last you'll give in  
  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up  
Wake me up

In my heart is where I long for you  
In my smile I search for you  
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside  
My silly way, just too young to know any more  
In my world the devil dances and dares  
To leave my soul just anywhere  
Until I find peace in this world  
I'll sing a song everywhere I can  
Just too young to know any more  
The wind covers me cold  
The starry skies all around my eyes  
Far behind the city moans  
Well worthy of the people there  
Oh, the psalms they love to hear  
So let me sing a song for you  
Just to help your day along  
Let me sing a song for you  
One I've known so very long  
Oh, please could you find the time

sit down, stand up  
sit down, stand up  
walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)  
walk into the jaws of hell (sit down, stand up)  
anytime (sit down)  
anytime (stand up)  
sit down, stand up  
sit down, stand up  
we can wipe you out anytime (sit down, stand up)  
we can wipe you out (sit down, stand up)  
anytime (sit down)  
anytime  
stand up (the rain drops the rain drops)  
sit down (the rain drops the rain drops)  
oh  
the rain drops x46

When we realize we're only to die then we're out of here  
We're just skirting on the surface  
We have only to click our fingers and we disappear  
We're just skirting on the surface  
  
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice  
Being drawn to the ledge  
When we realize that once we're broken then nothing mends  
We're just skirting on the surface  
  
When we realize we're only held in suspension  
Until someone comes along and shakes us  
And as the pattern lines cross their fingers like a web  
Will we die upon the surface?  
  
Doll eyes trying to pull you through the ice  
Being drawn to the ledge  
When we realize that once we're broken then nothing mends  
We're just skirting on the surface

I'm lost, I'm a ghost  
Dispossessed, taken host  
My hunger burns a bullet hole  
A spectre of my mortal soul  
These rumors and suspicion  
Anger is a poison  
The only truth that I could see  
Is when you put your lips to me  
Futures tricked by the past  
Spectre, how he laughs  
  
Fear puts a spell on us  
Always second-guessing love  
My hunger burns a bullet hole  
A spectre of my mortal soul  
The only truth that I can see  
Spectre has come for me

I walk down the staircase,  
Magnetic pull.  
Back to the other place  
That I cannot go.  
I'm sending a chopper,  
To steal you away.  
  
The pot is full,  
Let me take control,  
Let me take control.  
  
The pot is full  
Of secrets to be told,  
Secrets to be told.  
  
Out of orbit  
And I always will.  
  
The pot is full,  
Let me take control,  
Let me take control.  
  
The pot is full  
Of secrets to be told,  
Secrets to be told

And the wise man said "I don't want to hear your voice"  
And the thin man said "I don't want to hear your voice"  
And they're cursing me  
And they won't let me be  
There's nothing to say  
And there's nothing to do  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
  
And my mother say "We don't't love you son some more"  
And the buildings say "Let me spit on your face some more"  
And the feeling is  
That there's something wrong  
'Cause I can't find the words  
And I can't find the song  
  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
  
Dear Sir, "I have a complaint  
"Can't remember what it is  
"That's why I'm here"  
  
Stop whispering, start shouting  
Stop whispering, start shouting

Rows of houses all bearing down on me  
I can feel their blue hands touching me  
All these things into position  
All these things we'll one day swallow whole  
And fade out again  
And fade out  
This machine will, will not communicate  
These thoughts and the strain I am under  
Be a world child, form a circle  
Before we all go under  
And fade out again  
And fade out again  
Cracked eggs, dead birds  
Scream as they fight for life  
I can feel death, can see its beady eyes  
All these things into position  
All these things we'll one day swallow whole  
And fade out again  
And fade out again  
Immerse your soul in love  
Immerse your soul in love  

The breath of the morning  
I keep forgetting  
The smell of the warm summer air  
  
I live in a town  
Where you can't smell a thing,  
You watch your feet  
For cracks in the pavement.  
  
Up above  
Aliens hover  
Making home movies  
For the folks back home,  
  
Of all these weird creatures  
Who lock up their spirits,  
Drill holes in themselves  
And live for their secrets.  
  
They're all uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight.  
  
I wish that they'd swoop down in a country lane,  
Late at night when I'm driving.  
Take me on board their beautiful ship,  
Show me the world as I'd love to see it.  
  
I'd tell all my friends but they'd never believe me,  
They'd think that I'd finally lost it completely.  
I'd show them the stars and the meaning of life.  
They'd shut me away.  
But I'd be alright, alright,  
I'm be alright,  
I'm alright.  
  
I'm just uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight, uptight,  
Uptight.

You bite through the big wall, the big wall bites back  
You sit there and sulk, you sit there and bawl  
You look so pretty, when you're on your knees  
Disinfected, and eager to please  
  
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn  
God rest your soul  
When the loving's come but we're already gone  
Just like your dad, you'll never change  
  
Each time it comes, it eats me alive  
I try to behave, but it eats me alive  
So I declare a holiday  
Fall asleep, drift away  
  
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn  
God rest your soul  
When the loving's come but we're already gone  
Just like your dad, you'll never change  
  
Sometimes you sulk, sometimes you burn  
God rest your soul  
When the loving's come but we're already gone  
Just like your dad, you'll never change

I want to  
I want to be someone else or I'll explode  
Floatin' upon this surface for the birds,  
The birds  
The birds  
  
You want me?  
Fuckin' well, come and find me.  
I'll be waitin'  
With a gun and a pack of sandwiches,  
And nothin'  
Nothin'  
Nothin'  
  
You want me?  
Well, come and break the door down.  
You want me?  
Fuckin' come and break the door down.  
I'm ready, I'm ready, I'm ready,  
I'm ready,  
I'm ready

Where do we go from here  
The words are coming out all weird  
Where are you now when I need you  
Alone on an airplane  
Falling asleep against the window pain  
My blood will thicken  
  
I need to wash myself again  
To hide all the dirt and pain  
'Cause I'd be scared that there's nothing underneath  
And who are my real friends  
Have they all got the bends  
Am I really sinking, this slow  
  
My baby's got the bends, oh no  
We don't have any real friends, no no no  
  
I'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed on  
Talking to my girlfriend  
Waiting for something to happen  
And I wish it was the 60s,  
I wish I could be happy, I wish, I wish, I wish  
That something would happen  
  
Where do we go from here  
The planet is all gummed up in a sea of fear  
And where are you  
  
They brought in the C.I.A  
The tanks and the whole marines to blow me away  
To blow me sky high  
  
Baby's got the bends  
We don't have any real friends  
  
I'm just lying in a bar with my drip feed on  
Talking to my girlfriend  
Waiting for something to happen  
And I wish it was the 60s,  
I wish I could be happy, I wish, I wish, I wish  
That something would  
  
I want to live and breathe  
I want to be part of the human race  
I want to live and breathe  
I want to be part of the human race, race, race  
  
Where do we go from here  
The words are coming out all weird  
Where are you now, when I need you

Beauty will destroy your mind  
Spare the gory details  
Give them gift wrap for the man with everything  
  
Though I lived a lonely life  
I was confused  
I'm butcher  
Feel nothing  
As it closes up my arms  
The position of the worms  
Up, up, through my heart  
Into my brain  
  
I'm the big slack basic combination  
Cut out  
Chop, liver on the block  
My heart still pumping  
My heart still pumping  
  
He's a warrior, warrior  
He's a little bitch coming out of him  
He's a warrior, warrior  
He's a little bitch coming out of him  
Coming out of him

The moon is high up on a mountain  
The lunatics have taken over the asylum  
Waiting on the rapture  
  
Singing, "We're here to keep your prices down  
We'll feed you to the hounds  
To the daily mail, to get up, together"  
  
You made a pig's ear, you made a mistake  
Paid off security and got through the gate  
You got away with it but we lie in wait, eh  
Eh, eh  
  
Where's the truth what's the use  
I'm hanging around lost and found  
And when you're here innocent  
Fat chance, no plan  
No regard for human life  
  
You'll keep time, you've no right  
You're fast to lose, you will lose  
You jumped the queue, you're back again  
  
President for life, love of all  
The flies in the sky, the beasts of the earth  
The fish in the sea have lost command

[Verse 1]  
It holds us like a phantom  
The touch is like a breeze  
It shines its understanding  
See the moon smiling  
  
Open on all channels  
Ready to receive  
And we're not at the mercy  
Of your shimmerers or spells  
Your shimmerers or spells  
Mmmhm  
  
We are of the earth  
To her we do return  
The future is inside us  
It's not somewhere else  
It's not somewhere else  
It's not somewhere else  
  
[Chorus]  
(One day at a time)  
One day at a time  
  
[Verse 2]  
We call upon the people  
People have this power  
The numbers don't decide  
Your system is a lie  
The river running dry  
The wings of a butterfly  
And you may pour us away like soup  
Like we're pretty broken flowers  
We'll take back what is ours  
Take back what is ours  
  
[Chorus]  
One day at a time

Present Tense:  
  
This dance

I won't get heavy  
Don't get heavy  
Keep it light and  
Keep it moving  
I am doing  
No harm  
As my world  
Comes crashing down  
I'll be dancing  
Freaking out  
Deaf, dumb, and blind  
  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost  
  
I won't turn around at the penny drop  
Won't stop now  
I won't slack off  
Or all this love  
Will be in vain  
  
I stop from falling  
Down a mine  
It's no one's business but mine  
Or all this love  
Has been in vain  
  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost  
In you I'm lost

Why must I be the thief?  
Why must I be the thief?  
Oh Lord please won't you tell me,  
Why must I be the thief.  
  
Why must I be the thief  
He said to the hanging man  
And how come you're the only one  
That's black around, that always stares  
  
Why must I be the thief  
He asked of the hanging man  
And how come you're the only one  
Who lived with an open hand  
Now why must I be the thief  
You've cursed with many clouds  
And the hanging man without his hand  
Looked beyond his heart  
  
The thief was drawn to the cross  
To share that other's fate  
But the Jesus man said "Not now"  
"My brother not now, it's far too late"  
(far too late) (7x)  
  
Do what you must  
Take what you can  
Steal the pride from every heart,  
Every angered man (3x)  
I am the thief  
I am the thief  
And you will run  
Yes and you will hide  
But I'll get you then  
Yes I will  
Because of you, because it's justified.  
I will get you yet  
Cause it's justified  
I will get you yet  
It's justified  
I will get you yet  
It's justified

It barks at no one else but me,  
Like it's seen a ghost.  
I guess it's seen the sparks a-flowin,  
No one else would know.  
  
Hey man, slow down, slow down,  
Idiot, slow down, slow down.  
  
Sometimes I get overcharged,  
That's when you see sparks.  
They ask me where the hell I'm going?  
At a 1000 feet per second,  
  
Hey man, slow down, slow down,  
Idiot, slow down, slow down.  
  
Hey man, slow down, slow down,  
Idiot, slow down, slow down.

Rust in the mountains  
Rust in the brain  
The air is sacred here  
In spite of your claim  
Up on the roof tops  
Out of reach  
Trickster is meaningless  
Trickster is weak  
He's talking out the world  
Talking out the world  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
  
I wanted you so bad  
And I couldn't say  
All things fall apart  
We wanted out so bad  
We couldn't say  
These things fall apart  
We're talking out the world  
Talking out the world  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
Hey  
Hey  
Hey  
This is only halfway  
  
Truant kids a can of brick dust worms  
Who do not want to climb down from  
Their chestnut tree  
Long white gloves  
Police tread carefully  
Escaped from the zoo  
The perfect child facsimile  
It's talking out the world  
Talking out the world

In pitch dark  
I go walking in your landscape  
Broken branches  
Trip me as I speak  
  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
  
There's always a siren  
Singing you to shipwreck  
(Don't reach out, don't reach out  
Don't reach out, don't reach out)  
  
Stay away from each rocks  
We'd be a walking disaster  
(Don't reach out, don't reach out  
Don't reach out, don't reach out)  
  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
(Someone on your shoulder  
Someone on your shoulder)  
  
Just 'cause you feel it  
Doesn't mean it's there  
(Someone on your shoulder  
Someone on your shoulder)  
  
There there!  
  
Why so green and lonely?  
Lonely, lonely?  
  
Heaven sent you to me  
To me, to me?  
  
We are accidents waiting  
Waiting to happen  
  
We are accidents waiting  
Waiting to happen

Been thinking about you, your records are here  
Your eyes are on my wall, your teeth are over there  
But I'm still no one, and you're now a star  
What do you care?  
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest  
Should I still love you, still see you in bed  
But I'm playing with myself?  
What do you care when the other men are far, far better?  
  
All the things you got,  
All the things you need  
Who bought you cigarettes,  
Who bribed the company to come and see you, honey  
  
I've been thinking about you, so how can you sleep?  
Those people aren't your friends, they're paid to kiss your feet  
They don't know what I know.  
Why should you care when I'm not there?  
  
Been thinking about you, and there's no rest  
Should I still love you, still see you in bed  
When I'm playing with myself?  
What do you care when I'm not there?  
  
All the things you got  
That you'll never need  
All the things you got  
I'm played out and bleed to please you  
  
Been thinking about you...

Can you hear them?  
The helicopters?  
I'm in New York  
No need for words now  
We sit in silence  
You look me  
In the eye directly  
You met me  
I think it's Wednesday  
The evening  
The mess we're in and  
  
The city sun sets over me  
  
Night and day  
I dream of  
Making love  
To you now baby  
Love-making  
On-screen  
Impossible dream  
And I have seen  
The sunrise  
Over the river  
The freeway  
Reminding  
Of this mess we're in and  
  
The city sun sets over me  
  
What were you wanting?  
I just want to say  
Don't ever change now baby  
And thank you  
I don't think we'll ever meet again  
And you must leave now  
Before the sunrise  
Above skyscrapers  
The sin and  
The mess we're in and  
  
The city sun sets over me

[Verse 1]  
All the holes at once are coming alive, set free  
Out of sight and out of mind, lonely  
And their prey  
  
[Chorus]  
The ones you light your fires to keep away  
Crawling out upon, expending  
And all you have to do is say yeah  
  
[Verse 2]  
All the birds stay up in the trees  
All the fish swim down too deep and lonely  
And they pray  
Honey, come to me before it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
The ones you light your fires to keep away  
Is crawling out upon, expelling  
And all you have to do is say yeah

I'll drown my beliefs  
To have you be in peace  
I'll dress like your niece  
And wash your swollen feet  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave  
  
I'm not living,  
I'm just killing time  
Your tiny hands  
Your crazy-kitten smile  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave  
  
And true love waits  
In haunted attics  
And true love lives  
On lollipops and crisps  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave  
  
Just don't leave  
Don't leave

I'm stuck in the T.A.R.D.I.S.  
Trapped in hyperspace  
One minute snake charming  
The next in a motorcade  
All the right moves in  
In the right places  
Watch me dance, I'm a puppet  
You can almost see the strings  
Give me an answer  
Give me a line  
I've been climbing up this ladder  
I've been wasting my time  
Up on the ladder  
We're all tied to a stake  
Up on the ladder  
We wait for your mistake  
Up on the ladder  
Try to call out your name  
Up on the ladder  
You're all the fucking same  

No longer caught up  
Big church wall  
Makin' some noise with a pair of drums  
Lying your thoughts out over the sky  
Spinning around as you gaze at the sun  
(What is that you say?)  
Why don't you talk to me?  
(What don't you talk to me?)  
What is that you say?  
(What is that you say?)  
Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck  
I see the grass is still when we made our beds  
I see the thin weed boy ride at this edge  
I see the holy Jesus and the Pharoah and the Venus  
And the ghost of you and me  
Gagged and given up for dead  
(What is that you say?)  
Why don't you talk to me?  
(What don't you talk to me?)  
What is that you say?  
(What is that you say?)  
Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck  
There's something up there but I  
Don't know what the hell it is  
There's something up there  
As you guessed  
Like the sun  
(What is that you say?)  
Why don't you talk to me?  
(What don't you talk to me?)  
What is that you say?  
(What is that you say?)  
Wrapping your fingers 'round my neck

So, so you think you can tell  
Heaven from hell,  
Blue skies from rain  
Can you tell  
A green field from a cold steel rail?  
A smile from a veil?  
Do you think you can tell?  
  
And did they get you to trade  
Your heroes for ghosts?  
Hot ashes for trees?  
Hot air for a cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for change?  
And did you exchange  
A walk on part in the war for a lead role in a cage?  
  
How I wish, how I wish you were here  
We're just two lost souls swimming in a fish bowl,  
Year after year running over the same old ground  
What have you found?  
The same old fears  
  
Wish you were here...

I resent you calling  
I resent your voice  
I resent that I  
Don't have a choice  
  
Anywhere I go  
You are always there  
Outside the car  
Or in my hair  
  
I think I've been here before  
Yes I've been here before  
The last time you locked  
All the doors  
  
And I resent you calling  
I resent your voice  
I resent that I  
Don't have a choice  
  
And yes I am  
Yes I am  
  
I think I've told you once  
I think I needed advice  
You were such a help  
That's very nice  
  
I think I've been here before  
Yes I've been here before  
But this time I kick  
Down your door  
  
Yes I am  
Yes I am
