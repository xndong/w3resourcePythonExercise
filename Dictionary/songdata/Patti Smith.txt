Toward another  
He has gone  
To breathe an air  
Beyond his own  
Toward a wisdom  
Beyond the shelf  
Toward a dream  
That dreams itself  
  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
  
From the forest  
From the foam  
From the field  
That he had  
Known  
Toward a river  
Twice as blessed  
Toward the inn  
Of happiness  
  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
  
From a chaos  
Raging sweet  
From the deep  
And dismal street  
Toward another  
Kind of peace  
Toward the great  
Emptiness  
  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
About a boy  
Beyond it all  
  
[ ]  
I stood among them  
I stood alone  
Boy boy  
Just a boy  
Just a little boy  
[ ]  
Just a little boy  
Who will never grow

Well, I dreamed I saw the knights  
In armor coming,  
Saying something about a queen.  
There were peasants singing and  
Drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree.  
There was a fanfare blowing  
To the sun  
That was floating on the breeze.  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies.  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the nineteen seventies.  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes.  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst thru the sky.  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like getting high.  
I was thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie.  
Thinking about what a  
Friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie.  
  
Well, I dreamed I saw the silver  
Space ships flying  
In the yellow haze of the sun,  
There were children crying  
And colors flying  
All around the chosen ones.  
All in a dream, all in a dream  
The loading had begun.  
They were flying Mother Nature's  
Silver seed to a new home in the sun.  
Flying Mother Nature's  
Silver seed to a new home.

We were going to see the world  
In this land  
We placed Baptismal fonts  
And an infinite number were baptized  
And they called us "Carabi"  
Which means "Men of Great Wisdom"  
  
Where are you going,  
And are you going anywhere?  
Where are you going  
Send me a letter, if you go at all  
  
Ahh, the salvation of souls,  
But wisdom we had not  
For these people had neither King nor Lord  
And bowed to no one  
And they had lived in their own liberty  
  
Where are you going,  
And are you going anywhere?  
Going in circles  
Going in circles, anywhere  
  
I saw the new  
The inconstant shifting of fortune  
And now I write to you  
Words that have not been written  
Words from the New World  
Tracing the circles  
Moving across my eyes  
Lying on a ship  
And gazing at the western skies  
Tracing lazy circles in the sky  
  
Hey!  
  
Wake Up!  
Wake Up!  
  
Where are you going,  
And are you going anywhere?  
Where are you going  
Send me a letter, if you go at all  
  
It's such a delight  
To watch them dance  
Be it sacrifice or romance  
Free of all the things that we hold dear  
Is that clear, Your Excellency?  
  
And I guess it's time to go but  
I gotta send you just a few more lines  
From the New World  
  
Tracing the circles  
Moving across my eyes  
Lying on a ship  
And gazing at the western skies  
Tracing lazy circles in the sky  
  
Tracing lazy circles in the sky  
Tracing lazy circles  
  
And the sky opened  
And we laid down our armour  
And we danced  
Naked as they  
Baptized in the rain  
Of the New World

Come be my April Fool  
Come you're the only one  
Come on your rusted bike  
Come we'll break all the rules  
  
We'll ride like writers ride  
Neither rich nor broke  
We'll race through alleyways  
In our tattered cloaks so  
  
Come be my April Fool  
Come we'll break all the rules  
  
We'll burn all of our poems  
Add to God's debris  
We'll pray to all of our saints  
Icons of mystery  
We'll tramp through the mire  
When our souls feel dead  
With laughter we'll inspire  
Then back to life again  
  
Come you're the only one  
Come be my April Fool  
Come come  
Be my April Fool  
We'll break all the rules

If you can just get your mind together  
Then come across to me  
We'll hold hands an' then we'll watch the sun rise  
From the bottom of the sea  
But first  
  
Are You Experienced?  
Ah! Have you ever been experienced?  
Well, I have  
  
I know, I know  
You'll probably scream n' cry  
That your little world won't let go  
But who in your measly little world are trying to prove that  
You're made out of gold and -a can't be sold  
  
So-er, Are You Experienced?  
Ah! Have you ever been experienced?  
Well, I have  
  
Ah, let me prove it to you  
I think they're calling our names  
Maybe now you can't hear them, but you will  
If you just take hold of my hand  
  
Ah! But Are You Experienced?  
Have you ever been experienced?

Darlin' come under cover  
Another night to discover  
Let's slip where senses gather  
Let's drift between the sea and sky  
As the night goes by  
  
Sands shift  
Orchids so strange  
In the moonlight  
Brushing our faces  
Places where love blooms  
And dies  
While the night goes by  
Oh, and the spirits call  
Sun upon your shadows fall  
Tracing every breath we draw  
  
Come into my dreams  
Come into my dreams  
Darlin' let's go where the night goes  
Let's drift where senses gather  
Let's make this night last forever  
Into my dreams  
Into my dreams  
  
Darlin' let's go  
Where the night goes  
Time slips  
Oh darlin' how it flies  
When the night goes by  
  
All through the night  
Sirens call  
Come to me  
I'll come to you  
As the night softly  
goes by bye  
  
Midnight  
Moon on our shoulder  
Daybreak  
Another one older  
Darlin' heavenly blue  
Glories fade into view  
  
Let's go  
Under the stars  
That are beating  
Under the moonlight  
Stars shoot  
Dusk just a whisper  
Make this night  
Last forever  
Oh how I wonder  
Where the night goes  
Oh Let's wonder  
Where the night goes  
As the night goes  
By bye  
By bye

Moooooove! Ask the angels who they're calling,  
Go ask the angels if they're calling to thee  
Ask the angels while they're falling  
Who that person could possibly be  
And I know you got the feeling,  
You know, I feel it crawl across the floor  
And I know it got you reelin'  
And honey honey the call is for war  
And it's wild wild wild wild.  
Everybody got the feelin'  
You know the feeling and it's stronger each day  
Everybody wants to be reelin'  
And baby baby I'll show you the way  
And I know it's hard sometimes,  
You got a piece and hit across the sky  
And I know it's hard sometimes  
And world war is the battle cry  
And it's wild wild wild wild  
Across the country through the fields  
You know I see it written 'cross the sky  
People rising from the highway  
And war war is the battle cry  
And it's wild wild wild wild.  
Armageddon, it's gotten  
No savior jailer can take it from me  
World ending, it's just beginning  
And rock and roll is what I'm born to be  
And it's wild wild wild wild  
Wild wild wild wild X3  
Ask the angels if they're startin' to move  
Comin' in droves in from L.A.  
Ask the angels if they're starting to groove  
Lightning as armor and it's today  
It's wild wild wild wild  
Wild wild wild wild X3

I haven't fucked much with the past  
But I've fucked plenty with the future  
Over the skin of silk are scars  
From the splinters of stations and walls I've caressed  
  
A stage is like each bolt of wood  
Like a, like a log of Helen, is my pleasure  
I would measure the success of a night by the way, by the way I  
By the amount of piss and seed I could exude  
Over the columns that nestled the P.A.  
  
Some nights I'd surprise everybody by skipping off  
With a skirt of green net sewed over  
With flat metallic circles which dazzled and flashed  
The lights were violet and [Incomprehensible] white  
I had an ornamental veil, I can't bear to use it  
  
With the way my hair was cropped, I craved, craved covering  
But now that my hair itself is a veil  
And the scalp inside is a scalp of a crazy  
And a sleepy Comanche lies beneath this netting of skin  
  
I wake up, I am lying peacefully  
I am lying peacefully and my knees are open to the sun  
I desire him and he is absolutely ready to seize me  
In, in, in, in, in heart, I am a Muslim, in heart, I am an American  
In heart, I am Muslim, in heart, I'm an American artist and I have no guilt  
  
I seek pleasure, I seek the nerves under your skin  
The narrow archway, the layers, the scroll of ancient lettuce  
We worship the flaw, the belly, the belly  
The mole on the belly of an exquisite whore  
He spared the child and spoiled the rod  
I have not sold myself to God

Take me now baby here as I am  
Pull me close, try and understand  
Desirous hunger is the fire I breathe  
Love is a banquet on which we feed  
  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take my hand come undercover  
They can't hurt you now,  
Can't hurt you now, can't hurt you now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to lust  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
Have I doubt when I'm alone  
Love is a ring, the telephone  
Love is an angel disguised as lust  
Here in our bed until the morning comes  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel under your command  
Take my hand as the sun descends  
They can't touch you now,  
Can't touch you now, can't touch you now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
  
With love we sleep  
With doubt the vicious circle  
Turn and burns  
Without you I cannot live  
Forgive, the yearning burning  
I believe it's time, too real to feel  
So touch me now, touch me now, touch me now  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
  
Because tonight there are two lovers  
If we believe in the night we trust  
Because tonight there are two lovers

Oh  
To be  
Not anyone  
Gone  
This maze of being  
Skin  
Oh  
To cry  
Not any cry  
So mournful that  
The dove just laughs  
The steadfast gasps  
  
Oh  
To owe  
Not anyone  
Nothing  
To be  
Not here  
But here  
Forsaking  
Equatorial bliss  
Who walked through  
The callow mist  
Dressed in scraps  
Who walked  
The curve of the world  
Whose bone scraped  
Whose flesh unfurled  
Who grieves not  
Anyone gone  
To greet lame  
The inspired sky  
Amazed to stumble  
Where gods get lost  
Beneath  
The southern cross

Mother as I write the sun dissolves  
Blood life streaming cross my hand  
And these words, these words  
Hope dashed immortal hope  
Hope streaking the canvas sky  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
  
We joined the long caravan  
Hungry dreaming going west  
Just for work just to get a job  
And we never got lucky  
We just forged on  
And the dust the endless dust  
Like a plague it covered everything  
Hal fell with the fever  
And mother I did what I could  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
  
We prayed we prayed for rain  
I never wanted to see the sun again  
  
All my dresses you made by hand  
We left behind on the road  
Hal died in my arms  
We buried him by the river  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write  
Blue poles infinitely winding, as I write, as I write

Oh the story's told been told retold  
From the sacred scriptures to the tabloids  
All the fuss and fight none above a whisper  
The soul of gold the belly of a boy  
  
Well they drew him from the forest  
Like they draw blood  
Tied him to a tree like St. Sebastian  
And he turned his head and let the arrows fly  
Through the trees, the trees  
The ornamental leaves  
  
Boy cried wolf  
Wolf don't come  
Wolf within  
Boy cried wolf  
  
In the ancient mold they're dancing down  
Calling to the moon but it don't answer  
And they fell on their knees  
and passed the bowl around  
And the blood the blood the sacramental blood  
  
Boy cried wolf  
Wolf don't come  
Wolf within  
Boy cried wolf  
  
I am the body I am the stream  
I am the wake of everything  
They bring me flowers that are myself  
Garlands of blood that are myself  
Slain the lamb that is himself  
  
Torn reborn the cries of our dismay  
Are nothing to the wind but whose to mind  
Kings are lifted up and kings are thrown  
  
Lost received retrieved  
The human tide  
  
Innocence had its day  
Innocence had its day  
Innocence innocence

Car stopped in a clearing,  
Ribbon of life, it was nearing.  
I saw the boy break out of his skin.  
My heart turned over and I crawled in.  
He cried, break it up, oh I don't understand,  
Break it up, I can't comprehend.  
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.  
Break it up, don't talk to me that way,  
I'm not listening.  
Snow started falling,  
I could hear the angel calling.  
We rolled on the ground, he stretched out his wings.  
The boy flew away and he started to sing.  
He sang, break it up, oh, I don't understand.  
Break it up, I can't comprehend.  
Break it up, oh, I want to feel you.  
Break it up, don't look at me.  
  
The sky was raging, the boy disappeared,  
I fell on my knee  
Atmosphere broke up, the boy reappeared.  
I cried, take me please!  
  
Ice, it was shining.  
I could feel my heart, it was melting.  
I tore off my clothes, I danced on my shoes.  
I ripped my skin open and then I broke through.  
I cried, break it up, oh, now I understand.  
Break it up, and I want to go.  
Break it up, oh please take me with you.  
Break it up, I can feel it breaking,  
I can feel it breaking, I can feel it breaking,  
I can feel, I can feel, I can feel, I can feel.  
  
So break it up, oh now I'm coming with you.  
Break it up, now I'm gonna go.  
Break it up, oh, feel me, I'm coming.  
Break it up, break it up, break it up,  
Break it up, break it up, break it up,  
Oh, break it up, break it up, break it up  
Break it up, break it up, break it on up  
Break it up, break it on up, up, up  
Break it, break it, break it, break it  
Break it on up, break it up,  
Break it up, break it up, break it up

Here we go around again Curve of life spiraling  
Everything we've ever known As the seed of life gets blown  
And the miracle of time When will that time just end  
Remember, you decide Take that vow  
Grab that ring It's not a whim  
Not a whim When you be cashing in  
  
Try to turn your life around And all the things you do resound  
And then you can't loose control Say your time has come and then  
Hard to pinpoint find the seam Where that one time ends  
Where that time begins Remember, you decide  
Take that vow Take a stand  
Grab that ring It's not a whim  
It's not a whim It's only time  
That you're cashing in  
  
In the white noise of desire We can't hear a single thing  
Floating round the fragile bough Afflictions of the human soul  
Its beauty immaterial  
  
You decide Stand along  
The fallen ones Take revenge  
Defeated sons Rend that coat  
From seam to seam It's only time  
It's only time That you spend  
You spend It's only time  
You spend Its only time  
You spend It's only life  
That you're cashing in

[Originally by Bob Dylan]  
  
Sixteen years  
Sixteen banners united over the field  
Where the good shepherd grieves  
Desperate men, desperate women divided  
Spreading their wings 'neath falling leaves.  
  
Fortune calls  
I stepped forth from the shadows to the marketplace  
Merchants and thieves, hungry for power, my last deal gone down  
She's smelling sweet like the meadows where she was born  
On midsummer's eve near the tower.  
  
The cold-blooded moon  
The captain waits above the celebration  
Sending his thoughts to a beloved maid  
Whose ebony face is beyond communication  
The captain is down but still believing that his love will be repaid.  
  
They shaved her head  
She was torn between Jupiter and Apollo  
A messenger arrived with a black nightingale  
I seen her on the stairs and I couldn't help but follow  
Follow her down past the fountain where they lifted her veil.  
  
I stumbled to my feet  
I rode past destruction in the ditches  
With the stitches still mending beneath a heart-shaped tattoo  
Renegade priests and treacherous young witches  
Were handing out the flowers that I'd given to you.  
  
The palace of mirrors  
Where dog soldiers are reflected  
The endless road and the wailing of chimes  
The empty rooms where her memory is protected  
Where the angel's voices whisper to the souls of previous times.  
  
She wakes him up  
Forty-eight hours later the sun is breaking  
Near broken chains, mountain laurel and rolling rocks  
She's begging to know what measures he now will be taking  
He's pulling her down and she's clutching on to his long golden locks.  
Gentlemen, he said I don't need your organization, I've shined your shoes  
I've moved your mountains and marked your cards  
But Eden is burning either brace yourself for elimination  
Or else your hearts must have the courage for the changing of the guards.  
  
Peace will come  
With tranquillity and splendor on the wheels of fire  
But will bring us no reward when her false idols fall  
And cruel death surrenders with its pale ghost retreating  
Between the King and the Queen of Swords.

I was nothing. It didn't matter to me.  
Ah, there were tags all over my sleeve.  
There was water outside the windows  
and children in the streets [ ] rats with tags.  
  
Ain't got a passport.  
Ain't got my real name.  
Ain't got a chance, sport, at fortune and fame.  
And I walk these endless streets, won't you give me a lift.  
A lift. A lift. On your citizen ship.  
  
They were rioting in Chicago, movement in L.A.  
Sixty-eight it broke up the Yardbirds.  
We were broke as well.  
Took it underground, M.C. borderline, up against the wall.  
The wall. The wall.  
Show your papers, boy.  
  
Citizen ship we got mem'ries.  
Stateless, they got shame.  
Cast adrift from the citizen ship,  
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway.  
  
Blind alley in New York City, in a foreign embrace.  
If you're hungry you're not too particular about what you'll taste.  
Men in uniform gave me vinegar, spoon of misery.  
But what the hell, I fell, I fell.  
It doesn't matter to me.  
  
Citizen ship we got mem'ries  
Citizen ship, we got pain.  
Cast adrift from the citizen ship,  
lifeline denied, exiled this castaway.  
  
I was caught like a moth with its wings outta sync.  
Cut the chord. Overboard. Just a refugee.  
Lady liberty, lend a hand to me, I've been cast adrift.  
Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift. Adrift.  
  
On the citizen ship we got mem'ries  
Citizen ship, we got pain.  
Lose your grip on the citizen ship,  
you're cast, you're cast away.  
On the citizen ship you got mem'ry.  
Citizen ship you got pain.  
Citizen ship you got identity.  
A name. A name. A name. . .  
  
What's your name, son?  
What's your name? . . .  
What's your name?  
[ ]  
Nothing. I got nothing.  
[ ] Jersey.  
Give me your tired, your poor  
Give me your huddled masses  
your wartorn [ ]  
Give me your wartorn and your [ ]  
Lift up your [ ] unto me.  
Ah, mythology.

By patti smith  
  
Come back little sheba  
I hear them calling  
Open your ears  
Awake from thy sleep  
High above  
The stars are falling  
Open your arms  
And you shall receive  
  
The lights of the city  
So bold and flashing  
All of it's riches  
Imparted to thee  
Robes of saffron  
Robes of standing  
A road of crimson  
Spread at your feet  
  
Your robes of standing  
Your robes of saffron  
Your road of crimson  
All pleasing to me  
But close your lights  
Close your gates  
I must arise  
My flock awaits  
  
Farewell little sheba  
I hear them a'calling  
Here is your staff  
Tend to thy sheep  
Good wishes be with you  
If that be your calling  
Farewell little sheba  
Arise and take leave

This dead city  
Longs to be  
This dead city  
Longs to be free  
Seven screamin' horses  
Melt down in the sun  
Buildin' scenes on empty dreams  
And smokin' them one by one  
Hee haa  
The dead city  
Longs to be, yea, yea  
This dead city, yea  
Longs to be livin', ohh  
Is it any wonder  
There's squalor in the sun?  
With their broken schemes and their lotteries  
They never get nowhere  
Haa haa  
Is it any wonder  
They're spittin' at the sun?  
God's parasites in abandoned sites  
And they never have much fun  
Yeah  
Haa  
You don't need me?  
You don't need me?  
Yea I  
You don't need me?  
Well  
Mika I'll take you [incomprehensible]  
You know, you just try  
If I was a blind man  
Would you see for me?  
Or would you confuse the nature of my blues  
And refuse a hand to me  
Or is it any wonder  
Cryin' in the sun?  
Is it any wonder  
I'm cryin' in the sun?  
Well I built my dreams on your empty scenes  
Now I'm burnin' them one by one  
Haa hmm  
Oh this a damn city  
Oh this a dead city  
Immortal city  
Motor city  
Success city  
Longs to be  
Longs to be  
Longs to be  
Free  
Free  
Free  

Dead to the world my body was sleeping  
On my mind was nothing at all  
Come a mist an aire so appealing  
I'm here a whispering you summoned I called  
  
I formed me a presence whose aspect was changing  
Oh he would shift he would not shift at all  
We sat for a while he was very engaging  
And when he was gone I was gone on a smile  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
More lives than a cat  
That led me astray  
All in all he captured my heart  
Dead to the world and just  
Slipped away  
  
I heard me a music that drew me to dancing  
Lo I turned under his spell  
I opened my coat but he never came closer  
I bolted the door and whispered oh well  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
More lives than a cat  
That let me astray  
All in all he captured my heart  
Dead to the world and just  
Slipped away  
  
I laid in the rushes the air was upon me  
Wondering well I just couldn't discern  
Will he come back come back to me  
Oh I whispered will you ever return  
  
I was feeling sensations in no dictionary  
He was less than a breath of shimmer and smoke  
The life in his fingers unwound my existence  
Dead to the world alive I awoke  
  
With a strange way of walking  
And a strange way of breathing  
Less than a breath of shimmer and smoke  
The life in his fingers unwound my existence  
Dead to the world alive I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive alive I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive  
I awoke  
I awoke  
Alive I awoke  
Alive alive-o  
Alive alive-o

In the straw-colored light  
In light rapidly changing  
On a life rapidly fading  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light  
  
He sings a black embrade  
And white opals swimming  
In a child's leather purse  
Have you seen death swimming  
Have you seen death swimming  
  
With a throat smooth as a lamb  
  
Yet dry as a branch not snapping  
He throws back his head  
And he does not sing a thing mournful  
  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light  
  
He sings of youth enraged  
And the burning of Atlanta  
And these viral times  
And May ribbons streaming  
And straw-colored curls a-turning  
A mother's vain delight  
And woe to the sun  
And woe to the young  
Another hearse is drawn  
Have you seen death singing  
In the straw-colored light

When, when will you be landing?  
When, when will you return?  
Feel, feel my heart expanding  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered,  
I'm so tired I quit  
Take me forever, it doesn't matter  
Deep inside of your ship.  
  
La, la la la la la landing.  
Please, oh oh won't you return?  
Feel, see your blue lights are flashing,  
You and your alien arms  
  
Deep in the forest I whirl like I did as a little girl  
Let my eyes rise in the sky looking for you  
Oh you know, I would go anywhere at all  
'cause no star is too far with you, with you  
  
La, la la la la la landing.  
Please, oh oh won't you return?  
Feel, feel my heart expanding,  
You and your alien arms  
  
All my earthly dreams are shattered,  
I'm so tired I quit  
Take me forever, it doesn't matter  
Deep inside of your ship  
Land, land  
  
Oh I am waiting for you,  
Oh I am waiting for you, oh I am waiting for you,  
Waiting for you to take me up by my starry spine  
Ohhhh ohhhh with your distant fingers  
Oh I'm waiting for you, waiting for you,  
Oh I am waiting for you

Lower the thing the skin of a cat  
Skin it to the left just laying there  
No other thing is luck like that  
And you set it said it said nothing  
  
Went to the party very discouraged  
I watched the litter pile like a wall  
I looked at the river just couldn't forgive it  
It was ladened with all kinds of shit  
Still I admit that I didn't say nothing  
I turned my back walked away  
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing  
  
Everyone was dancing I stood over in the corner  
I was listening they were saying this and saying that  
And putting this one down but nothing was delivered  
Nothing good was coming I just stood there  
I couldn't believe it but I didn't say nothing  
I walked the floor then I looked away  
  
Got to face the fact that I didn't say nothing  
How long how long will we make do  
Maybe it's time to break on through  
Gonna lift my skirts gonna straighten up  
Gonna get well I'm gonna do something  
Gonna face the fact gonna give it back  
And I'm gonna do something won't hold my tongue  
Won't hold the thought won't hold the card  
Well I'm gonna do something  
Oh my brain I got to complain  
You can refrain but I'm gonna do something  
How long how long will we make do  
Maybe it's time to break on through  
  
Out in the desert I saw that old cat skinned  
I saw it floating in the river  
I saw and no one seemed to mind  
They sat there they sat there watching the sun  
I saw it float away and I watched the buildings crumble  
Like dust in the hand and we watched the sun  
Spread its wings and fly away  
And in the mountains a cry echoes  
Don't say nothing  
Don't say nothing no  
Don't say nothing no

Na, na, na, na, na  
Na, na, na, na, na  
I'm with you always, you're ever on my mind  
In a light to last, a whole life through  
Each way I turn, the sense of you  
Surrounds in every step I take in all I do  
Your thoughts your schemes  
Captivate my dreams  
Everlasting, ever new  
Sea returns to sea  
And sky to sky  
In a life of dream am I  
When I'm with you  
Deep in my heart, how the presence of you shines  
In a light to last a whole life through  
I recall the wonder of it all  
Each dream of life, I'll share with you  
Sea returns to sea  
And sky to sky  
In a life of dream am I  
When I'm with you  
I'm with you always, you're ever on my mind  
In a light to last a whole life through  
The hand above turns those leaves of love  
All and all a timeless view  
Each dream of life  
Flung from paradise  
Everlasting, ever new  
Dream of life  
Dream of life  
Na, na, na, na, na  

Easter Sunday, we were walking.  
Easter Sunday, we were talking.  
Isabel, my little one, take my hand. Time has come.  
  
Isabella, all is glowing.  
Isabella, all is knowing.  
And my heart, Isabella.  
And my head, Isabella.  
  
Frederick and Vitalie, savior dwells inside of thee.  
Oh, the path leads to the sun. Brother, sister, time has come.  
  
Isabella, all is glowing.  
Isabella, all is knowing.  
Isabella, we are dying.  
Isabella, we are rising.  
  
I am the spring, the holy ground,  
The endless seed of mystery,  
The thorn, the veil, the face of grace,  
The brazen image, the thief of sleep,  
The ambassador of dreams, the prince of peace.  
I am the sword, the wound, the stain.  
Scorned transfigured child of Cain.  
I rend, I end, I return.  
Again I am the salt, the bitter laugh.  
I am the gas in a womb of light, the evening star,  
The ball of sight that leads that sheds the tears of Christ  
Dying and drying as I rise tonight.  
  
Isabella, we are rising.  
Isabella, we are rising

I just don't know what to do tonight,  
My head is aching as I drink and breathe  
Memory falls like cream in my bones, moving on my own.  
  
There must be something I can dream tonight,  
The air is filled with the moves of you,  
All the fire is frozen yet still I have the will, ooh, ah.  
  
Trumpets, violins, I hear them in the distance  
And my skin emits a ray, but I think it's sad, it's much too bad  
That our friends can't be with us today

Welcome to your life  
There's no turning back  
Even while we sleep  
We will find you  
Acting on your best behavior  
Turn your back on mother nature  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
It's my own design  
It's my own remorse  
Help me to decide  
Help me make the most  
Of freedom and of pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
There's a room where the light won't find you  
Holding hands while the walls come tumbling down  
When they do I'll be right behind you  
So glad we've almost made it  
So sad they had to fade it  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
I can't stand this indecision  
Married with a lack of vision  
Everybody wants to rule the  
Say that you'll never never need it  
One headline, why believe it?  
Everybody wants to rule the world  
All for freedom and for pleasure  
Nothing ever lasts forever  
Everybody wants to rule the world  

It's been a hard time  
And when it rains  
It rains on me  
The sky just opens  
And when it rains  
It pours  
  
I walk alone  
Assaulted it seems  
By tears from heaven  
And darling I can't help  
Thinking those tears are yours  
  
Our wild love came from above  
And wilder still  
Is the wind that howls  
Like a voice that knows it's gone  
Cause darling you died  
And well I cried  
But I'll get by  
Salute our love  
And send you a smile  
And move on  
  
So darling farewell  
All will be well  
And then all will be fine  
The children will rise  
Strong and happy be sure  
Cause your love flows  
And the corn still grows  
And God only knows  
We're only given  
As much as the heart can endure  
  
But I don't know why  
But when it rains  
It rains on me  
The sky just opens  
And when it rains  
It pours  
  
But I look up  
And a rainbow appears  
Like a smile from heaven  
And darling I can't  
Help thinking that smile  
Is yours

Bone of my bone

I and I alone  
  
Two steps  
Till I can rest  
Two steps  
Till I'm blessed by you  
  
Oh oh oh  
Can but do for you  
I and I alone  
Oh oh oh

Hi hello wake from thy sleep  
God has given your soul to keep  
All of the power that burns in the flame  
Ignites the light in a single name  
  
Frederick name of care  
Fast asleep in a room somewhere  
Guardian angels [line a bed]  
Shed their light on my sleepy head  
  
I am a threshold yearning to sing  
Down with the the dancers having one last fling  
Here's to the moment when you said hello  
Come on my spirit are you ready let's go  
  
Hi hi hey hey  
Maybe I will come back some day now  
But tonight on the wings of a dove  
Up above to the land of love  
  
Now I lay me down to sleep  
Pray the Lord my soul to keep  
Kiss to kiss breath to breath  
My soul surrenders astonished to death  
  
Night of wonder for us to keep  
Set our sails channel [out] deep  
After the rapture two hearts meet  
Mine entwined in a single beat  
  
Frederick you're the one  
As we journey from sun to sun  
All the dreams I waited so long for  
Fly tonight so long so long  
  
Bye bye hey hey  
Maybe we will come back some day now  
But tonight on the wings of a dove  
Up above to the land of love  
  
Frederick name of care  
High above in sky that's clear  
All the things I've been dreamin' of  
Are expressed in this name of love  
  
Bye bye hey hey  
Maybe we will come back some day now  
But tonight on the wings of a dove  
Up above . . .

Every night before I go to sleep  
Find a ticket, win a lottery  
Scoop the pearls up from the sea  
Cash them in and buy you all the things you need  
Every night before I rest my head  
See those dollar bills go swirling 'round my bed  
I know they're stolen, but I don't feel bad  
I take that money, buy you things you never had  
Oh, baby, it would mean so much to me  
Oh, baby, to buy you all the things you need for free  
I'll buy you a jet plane, baby get you on a higher plane to a jet stream  
And take you through the stratosphere  
And check out the planets there and then take you down deep  
Where it's hot, hot in Arabia, babia, then cool, cold fields of snow  
And we'll roll, dream, roll, dream, roll, roll, dream, dream  
When we dream it, when we dream it, when we dream it  
We'll dream it, dream it for free, free money  
Free money, free money, free money, free money, free money  
Free money

Find a ticket, win a lottery

Oh, mountain of our eyes, what do you see?  
The girl with the omen dice, bowing to thee  
Mortal soldiers clear the path, shake the omen tree  
Oh, mountain of our eyes, oh plea  
Oh, hear our plea  
  
See the five fingers laid, like a hand in blue  
In sideways of the pure  
Together glimpse of you, together glimpse of you  
The great lake, the white shoot  
Your white mind, mind  
Whoa, mountain of mine  
Whoa, Fuji-san, for a planning  
Into the blue, into the great mist  
Into the bright, into your light  
  
Oh, mountain of our eyes, we're calling you  
Will you hear our cries, what will the poor boy do?  
What will the poor girl do?  
We're coming to you  
Whoa, Fuji-san  
Whoa, mountain of our eyes, what do you see?  
The girl with the omen dice, shaking the tree  
Shaking the omen tree

I had a dream Mr. King If you'll beg my pardon  
I was trespassing A sacred garden  
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy  
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi  
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi  
  
When he was a boy He was afraid of the dark  
His mother would fast And pray at his feet  
And the lamp burned as he slept Slept as he dreamed  
He was dreaming of his sisters Dressed in white muslin  
Dressed in white muslin Dancing in a ring  
He was afraid of the dark And the lamp burned  
And his mother fasted And prayed as he slept  
Dreaming of blossoms They were burning his throat  
He had eaten flowers Fell burning  
Flowers fell burning From the young girls' hair  
He was whispering Into his god's ear  
Let the children be so Let the children be so  
And the lamplight flickered flickered And his mother withered like Job  
And he lay there dreaming And the blossoms fell  
And Tilak's trumpet Proceeded to call  
And the blossoms fell And they dropped like candy  
And the people cried Gandhi Gandhi...  
  
I had a dream Mr. King If you'll beg my pardon  
I was trespassing The sacred garden  
And the blossoms fell Well, they dropped like candy  
And nature cried Gandhi Gandhi  
  
Hey little man Awake from your slumber  
Get 'em with the numbers Get 'em with the numbers  
  
He was frail and shy And the cast of his mind  
Was mercurial Was mercurial  
As the sacred verbs Scrawled  
In the dust On the floor  
On the floor Long live revolution  
And the spinning wheel And a handful of salt  
And a handful of salt The untouchables  
Dropped like candy They called to him  
Gandhi Gandhi The children of god  
With hands full of candy They called to him  
Gandhi Gandhi Feel our woes  
Man of the giving Rejoin the living  
Rejoin the living Awake from the net  
Where you've been sleeping And their climbing climbing  
The flowing hair And the golden flowers  
Of the young girls Well they dropped all around  
They dropped like candy And people cried  
Gandhi Gandhi Awake little man  
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers  
Get 'em with the numbers  
  
One Two Three Four hundred  
Thousand million people  
People People...  
  
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber  
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers  
Get 'em with the numbers Long live revolution  
And the spinning wheel Awake awake  
Is the mighty appeal Oh, people awake  
Awake from your slumber And get 'em with the numbers  
Get 'em with the numbers  
  
I had a dream Mr. King  
If you'll beg my pardon I was trespassing  
The sacred garden And the blossoms fell  
Dropped like candy And nature called  
Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi Gandhi  
  
Awake from your slumber Awake from your slumber  
And get 'em with the numbers Get 'em with the numbers

It's been a while since I've seen your face  
It's been a while since I've walked this place  
I see the monkeys riding on their bikesRacing through the impossible night  
You say you're feeling like a new tree  
  
Man they'll cut you from limb to limb  
Pick your pocket with such delightShake it to the rightShake it in the light  
Oh can't you see the glitter  
The glitter in their eyesOh can't you see the glitter  
  
The glitter in their eyes  
Genius stalking in new shoesHave you got WTO bluesDust of diamonds  
Making you sneeze  
Kids on rollers ready for  
  
Running through the junkyards  
Breezing through the hallsRacing through the malls  
Walking through the walls  
They'll strip your mind  
  
Just for fun  
Quoth the ravenYum yum yum  
  
Children children everywhere  
Selling souls for souvenirsThey've been sold out like as not  
Just for chunks of Ankgor Vat  
  
They'll trade you up  
Trade you downYour body a commodity  
Our sacred stage  
Has been defacedReplaced to graceThe marketplaceDow is jonesing at the bit42nd
Disney StreetRagged hearts unravelingLook out kidsThe gleam the gleam  
All that glittersIs not all that glittersIs not all that glitters

Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing again  
Let's go under where the sun beams  
Let's go under my friend  
  
Are we sleeping  
Are we dreaming  
Are we dancing again  
Is it heaven  
Crack it open  
And we'll slide down  
Its stream  
  
We can hold on (I'm sure)  
To the sea's foaming mane  
It will serve us  
We'll surface  
And we'll plunge back again  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
There's no burning where the sun beams  
Oh it's such a lovely game  
  
Does the sea dream (I'm sure)  
We are here, we attend  
We are bells on the shore  
Where the tolling suspends  
  
Who will decide the shape of things  
The shift of being  
Who will perceive  
When life is new  
Shall we divide and become another  
Who is due for gift upon gift  
Who will decide  
Shall we swim over and over  
The curve of a wing  
Its destination ever changing  
  
Sun is rising on the water  
Light is dancing like a flame  
Let's go waltzing on the water  
Let's go under again  
  
Let's go under  
Going under

Hey now man's own kin  
We commend into the wind  
Grateful arms grateful limbs  
Grateful soul he's gone again  
  
I have a winter's tale  
How vagrant hearts relent prevail  
Sow their seed into the wind  
Seize the sky and they're gone again  
  
Fame is fleeting God is nigh  
We raise our arms to him on night  
We shoot our flint into the sun  
We bless our spoils and we're gone we're gone  
  
Hey now man's own kin  
We commend into the wind  
Grateful arms grateful limbs  
Grateful heart he's gone again  
  
Here a man man's own kin  
He turned his back and his own people shot him  
And he fell on his knees  
Before the burning plane  
And he beheld fields of gold his land his sun  
And he arose his blood aflame  
The clouds pressed with hand prints stained  
  
One last breath  
The sky is high  
The hungry earth  
The empty vein  
The ashes rain  
Death's own bed  
Man's own kin  
Into the wind  
One last breath  
Hole in life  
Love knot tied  
Braid undone  
Child born  
The hollow horn  
Warrior cried  
A warrior died  
One last breath  
Lick of flame  
Spirit moaned  
Spirit shed  
The heavens fed  
Man's own kin  
Grips the sky  
And he's gone again  
  
Hey now man's own kin  
We lay down into the wind  
Grateful arms grateful limbs  
Grateful heart he's gone again  
  
Hey now man's own kin  
He ascends into the wind  
Grateful heart grateful limbs  
Grateful man he's gone again

What I feel when I'm playing guitar  
Is completely cold and crazy,  
Like I don't owe nobody nothing  
And it's just a test just to see  
How far I can relax  
Into the cold wave of a note.  
  
When everything hits just right (just and right)  
The note of nobility can go on forever.  
I never tire of the solitary E  
And I trust my guitar  
And I don't care about anything.  
  
Sometimes I feel like I've broken through  
And I'm free and I could dig into eternity  
Into eternity riding the wave  
And realm of the E.  
Sometimes it's useless.  
  
Here I am struggling and filled with dread  
Afraid that I'll never squeeze enough  
Graphite from my damaged cranium  
To inspire or asphyxiate any eyes  
Grazing like hungry cows across the stage or page.  
  
Inside of me I'm crazy I'm just crazy.  
Inside I must continue.  
I see her, my stiff muse,  
Jutting around round round  
Round like a broken speeding statue.  
  
The colonial year is dead  
And the Greeks too are finished.  
The face of Alexander remains not only solely  
Due to sculpture but through the power and foresight  
And magnetism of Alexander himself.  
  
The artist must maintain his swagger.  
He must he must he must be intoxicated  
By ritual as well as result.  
Look at me I am laughing.  
I am laughing.  
I am lapping cocaine from the hard brown palm  
Of the bouncer. and I trust my guitar.  
  
Therefore we black out together.  
Therefore I would run through scum.  
And scum is just ahead, ah we see it,  
But we just laugh.  
We're ascending through the hollow mountain.  
We are peeking.  
We are laughing.  
We are kneeling.  
We are laughing.  
We are radiating at last.  
  
This rebellion is just a gas  
Our gas a gas that we pass.

No equation  
To explain the division of the senses  
No sound to reflect  
The radiance of time  
In the beginningest dream  
Halls of disorder  
Where we are swept to encircle dawn  
Strapped in a low car  
Racing through silence  
Trumpeting bliss  
You could kiss the world  
Goodbye  
Standing outside the courthouse  
In the rain  
Seemed like a lost soul  
From the chapel of dreams  
With a handful of images  
Faces of children  
Phases of the moon  
One little thing you get wrong  
Changes the dimensions  
Streets, swept memory  
Diffused and lost  
Like a prayer in the sun  
Sometimes you can't tell  
Whether you're waking up  
Or going to sleep  
Spiralling  
Unnumbered streets  
All the games cannot be yours  
All the sights, the treasures of the eye  
Does the divided soul remain the same?  
No equation to explain  
Destiny's hand  
Moved, by love  
Drawn by the whispering shadows  
Into the mathematics  
Of our desire  

Oh glad day to celebrate 'Neath the cloudless sky  
Air so sweet Water pure  
Fields ripe with rye Come one, come all  
Gather round Discard your Sunday shoes  
Come on now Oh my land  
Be a jubilee Come on girl  
Come on boy Be a jubilee  
  
Oh my land Oh my good  
People don't be shy Weave the birth of harmony  
With children's happy cries Hand in hand  
We're dancing around In a freedom ring  
Come on now Oh my land  
Be a jubilee Come on girl  
Come on boy Be a jubilee  
  
We will never fade away Doves shall multiply  
Yet I see hawks circling the sky Scattering our glad day  
With debt and despair What good hour  
Will restore our troubled air? Come on people  
Gather round You know what to do  
Come on people Oh my land  
What be troubling Oh my land  
What be troubling What be troubling  
What be troubling you  
  
We are love and the future We stand in the midst of fury and weariness  
Who dreams of joy and radiance? Who dreams of war and sacrifice?  
Our sacred realms are being squeezed Curtailing civil liberties  
Recruit the dreams that sing to thee Let freedom ring  
  
Freedom ring Freedom ring  
Jubilee Oh my land  
Oh glad day Oh my land  
Hear our cry Freedom ring  
Oh glad day Oh my land  
Jubilee Jubilee

If it wasn't for your golden hair  
I would not be belonely  
If it wasn't for your golden hair  
I would not be alone  
  
If it wasn't for your piercing stare  
I would not be belonely  
If it wasn't for your piercing stare  
I would not be alone  
  
I would not waltz in a widow's line  
What was yours would not be mine  
If it wasn't for your golden hair  
I would not be alone  
  
You courted me with princely airs  
Said you'd love me only  
Kiss the ribbons in my hair  
Said darling come and fly  
  
Flower of the Calvary  
You swept me off my saddle  
Lifted me into your life  
A soldier's wife was I  
  
You marched proudly for the horn  
I prayed for your swift return  
I waited for you so forlorn  
'Ere to be alone  
I longed for you, I longed to die  
I was so belonely  
The pillow's bare by my side  
And yet I shall abide  
  
For heaven has aset for me  
Companion for eternity  
So kiss the ribbons in my hair  
Say darling come and fly  
  
If it wasn't for your golden hair  
I would not be alonely  
If it wasn't for your golden hair

At the edge of the world  
Where you were no one  
Yet you were the girl  
The only one  
At the edge of the world  
In the desert heat  
One shivering star  
Sweet indiscreet  
  
I knew you  
When we were young  
I knew you  
Now you're gone  
  
In a little Narcissus pool  
Drawn by its spell  
We saw ourselves  
Raw excitable  
I knew you  
When we were young  
I knew you  
Now you're gone  
  
We didn't know  
The precariousness  
Of our young powers  
All the emptiness  
  
Wild,wild hair  
Sad,sad eyes  
White shirt black tie  
You were mine  
  
You grabbed the ring  
Of the carousel  
Tangoing  
From Heaven to Hell  
I knew you

The fans were whirlin'  
Like the blades of a 'copter  
Liftin' into the skies above some foreign land  
Soaked with the bodies of so many friends.  
  
Johnny waved  
He was on his way home  
He waved goodbye to his comrades in arms,  
And all the twisted things he'd seen.  
He waved goodbye  
And the blades hit  
Something  
Maybe just fate, but the blades hit  
The 'copter went up in flames  
And johnny never went marchin' home  
Johnny never went marchin' home  
  
They took his name  
And they carved it on a slab of marble  
With several thousand other names  
All the fallen idols  
The apples of their mother's eye  
Just another name  
  
Meanwhile  
Back on that burning shore  
Johnny's comrades stood speechless  
They looked with uh-uh-uh-uh disbelieving eyes  
As those bits of metal and the embers  
The embers of his eyes  
Fanned out into the air  
Black dust  
Flames  
  
Oh johnny! Some day they'll make a movie about you  
And in the making of that movie  
Some mad apocalypse  
It will become even stranger than the simple act  
Just a boy going up up up  
Just a boy going up  
In flames in the smoke  
Just another life  
Just another breath  
And who'll remember  
Oh eternity now  
As eternal as a sheet of marble  
Eternal as a slab on a green hill  
And your name  
And all your fallen brothers  
And all the ones not cut  
All the ones remembered only in the hearts  
A mother a father a brother a sister a lover a son a daughter  
Shall not shall not fade shall not fade  
  
Your ancestors salute you  
And the gods of your ancestors salute you  
Having having been formed by the minds of your ancestors  
The gods of your ancestors salute you  
Having been formed by your ancestors  
The gods of your ancestors salute you  
They draw you in they draw you through  
They draw they draw you through that golden door  
  
Mornin' boy [come on in boy]  
We remember you  
We conceived of you  
We conceived of your breath  
We conceived of the whole human race  
And we conceived it to be a beautiful thing  
Like a tulip bending in the wind  
Sometimes it comes back to us  
In the form of a handful of dust  
Comes back in the form of a smitten child  
Our raped daughters, ah the broken bones  
Souls cleaved from hearts  
They come back to us  
And our hands are filled with their rotting tissues  
But we turn not our backs  
We press our lips  
Into their cancer into the dust into the remains of each one  
And that love is there and will greet you, will greet you  
Mornin' boy [come on in boy]  
It's eternal love  
  
Well here, go ahead, run through that flame  
Awww man, running through your mind  
You took a cat, you took a life, you took it by the tail  
And you swirled it around your head  
And you thrashed it, you smashed the life out of it  
And you knew that it would be your own  
But you wanted to feel, you wanted to feel it die  
Because you know you would feel your own  
You would feel your own  
But you're remembered!  
You're remembered!  
You're remembered dead!  
You're remembered dead!  
You're remembered dead!  
We remember  
We remember  
We remember  
Everything  
Everything

Little emerald bird  
Wants to fly away  
If I cup my hand  
Could I make him stay?  
  
Little emerald soul  
Little emerald eye  
Little emerald soul  
Must you say goodbye?  
  
All the things that we pursue  
All that we dream  
Are composed as nature knew  
In a feather green  
  
Little emerald bird  
As you light afar  
It is true I heard  
God is where you are  
  
Little emerald soul  
Little emerald eye  
Little emerald bird  
We must say goodbye

Last night in Konya a voice carried me  
To the pulpit of the arrow - did you hear it too?  
The oracle was written on a silver leaf  
Last night I read the words - did you read them too?  
  
Aah  
Precious heart, precious seed, precious life conceived  
In the ring of fire, in the sleep of peace  
Nothing stops desire for the human beat  
  
Last night was a rapture in the mosaic sky  
Dropping shards of love, dropping shards of love  
  
Aah  
Precious heart, precious seed, precious life conceived  
In the ring of fire, in the sleep of peace  
Nothing stops desire for the human beat  
  
I hunger for the cooling flame, I hunger for the infinite game  
  
Last night in Konya a voice carried me  
To the pulpit of the arrow - did you hear it too?  
The oracle was written on a silver leaf  
Last night I read the words - did you read them too?  
  
Devour me, yeah devour me  
  
Oh Precious heart, oh precious seed, oh precious life conceived  
In a ring of fire, in a sleep of peace  
Nothing stops desire for the human beat - the human beat

In my Blakean year I was so disposed  
Toward a mission yet unclear Advancing pole by pole  
  
Fortune breathed into my ear Mouthed a simple ode  
One road is paved in gold One road is just a road  
  
In my Blakean year Such a woeful schism  
The pain of our existence Was not as I envisioned  
  
Boots that trudged from track to track Worn down to the sole  
One road is paved in gold One road is just a road  
  
Boots that tramped from track to track Worn down to the sole  
One road was paved in gold One road was just a road  
  
In my Blakean year Temptation but a hiss  
Just a shallow spear Robed in cowardice  
  
Brace yourself for bitter flack For a life sublime  
A labyrinth of riches Never shall unwind  
The threads that bind the pilgrim's sack Are stitched into the Blakean back  
  
So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear  
For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year  
  
So throw off your stupid cloak Embrace all that you fear  
For joy shall conquer all despair In my Blakean year

We waltzed beneath motionless skies  
All heaven's glory turned in your eyes  
We expressed such sweet vows  
  
Oh till death do us part  
Oh till death do us part  
Oh-oh  
  
We waltzed beneath God's point of view  
Knowing no ending to our rendezvous  
We expressed such sweet vows  
  
Oh till death do us part  
Oh till death do us part  
Oh-oh  
  
Oh till death do us part  
Oh till death do us part  
Oh-oh  
  
We waltzed beneath motionless skies  
All heaven's glory turned in your eyes  
You pledged me your heart  
  
Till death do us part  
You pledged me your heart  
Till death do us part  
Till death do us part

You say hey  
The state of the union  
Is fine fine fine  
I got the feeling that you're lying  
Lying lying lying  
I think we need  
Think we're gonna need  
A new party  
  
They say to me  
They say what's the word  
I say it's thunderbird  
I say it's thunderbird  
Why don't you  
Fly fly fly  
Fly away hey  
And while you're at it  
Why don't you  
Fertilize my lawn  
Why don't you  
Fertilize my lawn  
With what's running from your mouth  
Running from your mouth  
Hey listen here  
  
We got to get off  
Our ass or get burned  
The world's troubles  
Are a global concern  
Does your child have  
Fresh water to drink  
Wherever you are  
Wherever you are you're invited  
To think about this  
  
When in the course  
Of human events  
It becomes necessary  
To take things into your own hands  
To take the water from the well  
And declare it tainted by greed  
We got to surely clean it up  
Clean our house  
Our inner house  
Our outer house  
Left right  
And hey by the way  
The human event  
Is the party of the century  
And you're all invited  
It's where you are  
Wherever you are  
'Cause this party  
Is for everyone  
And the price of admission  
Is love one another  
Love brother

Night a nine of diamonds  
A woman lay and cries  
At the sister of Mercy  
On a Sabbath day  
Night a nine of diamonds  
As revelers commence  
To shiver as she bore  
In a babe, a radiance  
  
Brave in constant motion  
Wherein perfection brews  
Darkness as his brother  
Mischief as his moon  
Summoning beneath  
With his gypsy moves  
Yearning as the foal  
Shy and beautiful  
  
Every card he drew  
Had a different face  
Lingering and lost  
Unholy holy ghosts  
I tend to play them all  
He spoke with confidence  
Another kind of strange  
To shift in loneliness  
  
He sought not for himself  
The empire he would find  
Save the golden womb  
He enter in his mind  
  
We will die a littler  
The rogues whistling  
Nine blue-eyed sailors  
Tip their caps to him  
As he passes through them  
More vagabond than king  
With diamonds on his sleeves  
Like a harlequin

Listen my children and you shall hear  
The sound of your own steps  
The sound of your hereafter  
Memory awaits and turns to greet you  
Draping its banner across your wrists  
Wake up arms  
Delicate feet  
For as one to march the streets  
  
Each alone, each part of another  
Your steps shall ring  
Shall raise the cloud  
And they that will hear will hear  
Will hear voice of the one  
And the one and the one  
As it has never been uttered before  
  
For something greater yet to come  
Then the hour of the prophets  
And their great cities  
  
For the people of Ninevah  
Fell to their knees  
Heeding the cry of Jonah  
United  
Covering themselves in sackcloth and ashes  
And called to their god  
  
And all their hearts were as one heart.  
And all their voices were as one voice.  
  
God heard them and his mind was moved.  
  
Yet something greater will come to pass.  
And who will call?  
And what will they call?  
Will they call to God?  
The air?  
The fowl?  
  
It will not matter, if the call is true.  
They shall call and this is known.  
One voice and each another  
Shall enter the dead, the living flower,  
Enter forms that we know not.  
To be felt by sea,  
By air,  
By earth  
And shall be an elemental pledge.  
  
This is our birthright.  
This is our charge.  
And we have given over to others.  
And they have  
Not  
Done  
Well  
  
And the forests mourn.  
The leaves fall.  
  
Swaddling babes watch and wonder  
As the fathers of our spirit nations  
Dance in the street in celebration  
As the mountains turn pale from  
Their nuclear hand  
And they have  
Not  
Done  
Well  
  
Now my children  
You must overturn the tables  
Deliver the future from material rule  
For only one rule should be considered  
  
The eleventh commandment  
To love one another  
And this is our covenant across your wrist  
  
This offering is yours  
To adorn, adore  
To bury  
To burn  
Upon a mound  
  
To hail  
To set away  
  
It is merely a cloth,  
Merely our colors,  
Invested with the blood of the people  
All their hopes and dreams.  
  
Our flag  
It has its excellence  
Yet it is nothing  
It shall not be a tyranny above us  
  
Nor should god  
Nor love  
Nor nature  
  
Yet we hold as our pleasure this tender honor  
That we acknowledge the individual  
And the common ground formed  
  
And if our cloth be raised and lowered  
Half mast  
What does it tell us?  
  
That an individual has passed  
Is saluted  
And mourned by his countrymen.  
  
This ritual extends to us all.  
For we are all the individual.  
  
No unknown.  
No insignificant one  
Nor insignificant labor  
Nor insignificant act of charity  
  
Each has a story to be told and retold  
Which shall be a glowing thread  
In the fabric of Man  
  
And the children shall march  
And bring the colors forward  
Investing within them  
  
The redeeming blood  
Of their revolutionary hearts.

In the garden of consciousness  
In fertile mind there lies the dormant seed  
When blooming as charity  
Conscience breathes a sigh of relief  
  
The confessions of sleep  
The awakening seed  
Moved by love to serve  
We celebrate all  
  
Merit in life  
Ah, the confessions of sleep  
Unfolding peace  
As we extend  
  
According to need  
And you will hear the call  
All action great and small  
Received joyfully  
  
Heaven abounds  
Let love resound  
If he be mute  
Give him a bell  
  
If he be blind, an eye  
It he be down, a hand  
Lift up your voice  
Lift up your voice  
  
Lift up your voice  
Give of your mind one mind  
Give of your heart one heart  
Give of your voice  
  
One voice

Speak to me  
Speak to me heart  
I feel a needing  
To bridge the clouds  
Softly go  
A way I wish to know  
A way I wish to know  
  
Oh you'll ride  
Surely dance  
In a ring  
Backwards and forwards  
Those who seek  
Feel the glow  
A glow we will all know  
A glow we will all know  
  
On that day  
Filled with grace  
And the heart's communion  
Steps we take  
Steps we trace  
Into the light of reunion  
  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
  
Speak to me  
Speak to me shadow  
I spin from the wheel  
Nothing at all  
Save the need  
The need to weave  
A silk of souls  
That whisper whisper  
A silk of souls  
That whispers to me  
  
Speak to me heart  
All things renew  
Hearts will mend  
Round the bend  
Paths that cross  
Cross again  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
  
Rise up hold the reins  
We'll meet again I don't know when  
Hold tight bye bye  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again  
Paths that cross  
Will cross again

Yesterday I saw you standing there With your hand against the pane  
Looking out the window At the rain  
  
And I wanted to tell you That your tears were not in vain  
But I guess we both knew We'd never be the same  
Never be the same  
  
Why must we hide all these feelings inside?  
Lions and lambs shall abide  
  
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again  
Build the peaceable kingdom Back again  
Build it back again  
  
Why must we hide all these feelings inside? Lions and lambs shall abide  
  
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again  
Build the peaceable kingdom Back again  
Maybe one day we'll be strong enough To build it back again  
Build the peaceable kingdom Build it back again  
  
Build the peaceable kingdom Build it back again

He's delighted to love me, but you know,  
I just don't know what to say to him. I just don't know.  
  
Heard it on the radio, it's no good  
Heard it on the radio, it's news to me  
When she gets something, it's understood  
Baby's got somethin' she's not used to  
  
Down, down, poppy, yeah  
Down, down, poppy, yeah  
  
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score  
Baby wants somethin', she's in the mood to  
Baby wants somethin', I want more  
When I don't get it, I get blue, blue  
  
Down, down, and it's really comin', really comin',  
Down, down, poppy, yeah  
  
Goin' on the corner, I'm gonna score  
Baby's got somethin', gonna get through, through  
When I want somethin' I want more,  
Heard it on the radio, there's nothin' I can do do  
  
I'm in the mood to and I'm a woman and an individual  
And I want rockin' real slow I wanna hear it on the radio  
I wanna hear it, I wanna score (poppies) I wanna hear  
It on the radio baby got it but baby want more  
On the radio, heard it on the radio  
Baby got it but baby want more  
[babble]  
Heard it on the radio won't be no need for layin' in the road  
Tonight I'm goin' out, oh yeah baby got it but baby want more  
She won't need it any more [babble]  
Although she was tense and lean in the sun splintered like a country  
Gently pulled his finger  
Everything is soakin' and spread with butter  
Their flowers on an average [on the seed? ]  
  
And then they laid her on the table  
She connected with the inhaler  
And the needle shiftin' like crazy,  
She was, she was completely still.  
It was like a painting of a vase,  
She just lay there and the gas traveled fast  
Through the dorsal spine and down and around  
(I want more)  
The anal cavity, her cranium  
(I wanna score)  
Just, it was really great, man,  
The gas had inflicted her entire spine  
With the elements of a voluptuous disease  
With a green vapor, made her feet light  
  
Baby want more  
  
Baby was it in the closet.  
Baby get it there, baby tag it,  
Baby got it and baby begged for it, baby  
  
I don't think (after station) there's any station  
(I remember when)  
Quite as interesting to me  
(baby worship something)  
As the 12th station  
(laughin' at the flowers)  
I tuned in (to the tower) too many centuries  
Were calling to me  
And I spin, come down thru time  
Oh, watch them say you're too high  
  
And I swim through  
  
Hear it on the radio, goddamn in my radio,  
Hear it on the radio, hear it on the radio  
[babble]  
One long ecstatic pure sensation  
Restriction started excreting, started excreting, ah exhilarating  
Bottomless pit  
  
Hey sheba, hey salome, hey venus eclipsin' my way ah.  
Her vessel, every woman is a vessel, is evasive, is aquatic.  
Everyone, silver ecstatic, platinum disk spinning

Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,  
Oh, into the center of my brain, and baby come, baby go  
And free the hurricane, oh, I go into the center of the airplane  
Baby gotta move to the center of my pain  
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping  
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so  
Total abandon, ooh, walla walla walla,  
  
Oh I see you stare spi-pi-pi-pi-pi-pi (spiraling) up there and ho,  
Oh, into the center of my brain and baby come, baby go  
And free the hurricane, oh I go into the center of the airplane,  
Baby gotta box in the center of the ring  
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping  
Upset, total abandon, you know I love you so.  
Total abandon, ooh wah  
  
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,  
Baby gotta go to the center of my brain  
And my heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,  
Got no recollection of my past reflection,  
So I'm free to move in the resurrection.  
My heart starts pumping, my fists start pumping,  
My heart pumping, my heart pumping, my heart pumping  
  
Coming in the airport, coming in the sea,  
Coming in the garden, got a conscious stream,  
Coming in a washroom, coming on a plane,  
Coming in a force field, coming in my brain  
And my heart, my heart,  
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,  
Total abandon, total abandon, total abandon,  
Total abandon  
  
Oh I go into the center of the airplane,  
Baby gotta move to the center of my brain,  
My heart oh

Suffer not Your neighbor's affliction  
Suffer not Your neighbor's paralysis  
But extend your hand Extend your hand  
Lest you vanish in the city And be but a trace  
Just a vanished ghost And your legacy  
All the things you knew Science, mathematics, thought  
Severely weakened Like irrigation systems  
In the tired veins forming From the Tigris and Euphrates  
In the realm of peace All the world revolved  
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle  
City of Baghdad City of scholars  
Empirical humble Center of the world  
City in ashes City of Baghdad  
City of Baghdad Abrasive aloof  
  
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep  
Deep in the veins of the great rivers  
That form the base Of Eden  
And the tree The tree of knowledge  
Held up its arms To the sky  
All the branches of knowledge All the branches of knowledge  
Cradling Cradling  
Civilization In the realm of peace  
All the world revolved Around a perfect circle  
Oh Baghdad Center of the world  
City of ashes With its great mosques  
Erupting from the mouth of god Rising from the ashes like  
a speckled bird Splayed against the mosaic sky  
Oh, clouds around We created the zero  
But we mean nothing to you You would believe  
That we are just some mystical tale We are just a swollen belly  
That gave birth to Sinbad, Scheherazade We gave birth  
Oh, oh, to the zero The perfect number  
We invented the zero And we mean nothing to you  
Our children run through the streets  
And you sent your flames Your shooting stars  
Shock and awe Shock and awe  
Like some, some Imagined warrior production  
Twenty-first century No chivalry involved  
No Bushido  
  
Oh, the code of the West Long gone  
Never been Where does it lie?  
You came, you came Through the west  
Annihilated a people And you come to us  
But we are older than you You come you want to  
You want to come and rob the cradle  
Of civilization And you read yet you read  
You read Genesis You read of the tree  
You read of the tree Beget by god  
That raised its branches into the sky Every branch of knowledge  
Of the cradle of civilization  
  
Of the banks of the Tigris and the Euphrates  
Oh, in Mesopotamia Aloofness ran deep  
The face of Eve turning What sky did she see  
What garden beneath her feet The one you drill  
You drill Pulling the blood of the earth  
Little droplets of oil for bracelets Little jewels  
Sapphires You make bracelets  
Round your own world We are weeping tears  
Rubies We offer them to you  
We are just Your Arabian nightmare  
We invented the zero But we mean nothing to you  
Your Arabian nightmare  
  
City of stars  
City of scholarship  
Science City of ideas  
City of light City  
City of ashes That the great Caliph  
Walked through His naked feet formed a circle  
And they built a city  
A perfect city of Baghdad  
In the realm of peace  
And all the world revolved  
And they invented And they mean nothing to you  
Nothing to you Nothing  
  
Go to sleep Go to sleep my child  
Go to sleep And I'll sing you a lullaby  
A lullaby for our city A lullaby of Baghdad  
Go to sleep Sleep my child  
Sleep Sleep  
Run Run  
  
You sent your lights Your bombs  
You sent them down on our city Shock and awe  
Like some crazy T.V. show  
  
They're robbing the cradle of civilization  
They're robbing the cradle of civilization  
They're robbing the cradle of civilization  
  
Suffer not The paralysis of your neighbor  
Suffer not But extend your hand

Common fortune seeks us all  
And slips our binding rings  
We'll turn our heads  
And make us reel  
We'll bare our arms as wings  
  
Before our feet a feather drifts  
Beyond us it will fall  
Cause time will bid and make us rise  
Make ravens of us all  
  
My love he breathed the air of kings  
Yet fell beneath his luck  
And in his heart a yearning yet  
Before his time time shook  
All the gifts that God had gave  
And those by fate denied  
Gone to where all treasures laid  
And where the raven flies  
  
Oh there are places I agree  
Where I have yet to roam  
The Egyptian field  
The arctic sea where shadows  
Haunt and moan  
But none but sky  
I have to go  
Should I return to thee  
Gone to where the feather flies  
To all eternity  
But for a time I got more time  
Till I a raven be  
  
'Cause time will bid and make us rise  
Make ravens of us all  
And time will bid and make us fly  
Make ravens of us all  
And time will bid and make us fly  
Make ravens of us all

Late afternoon, dreaming hotel  
We just had the quarrel that sent you away  
I was looking for you, are you gone, gone?  
  
Called you on the phone, another dimension  
Well, you never returned, oh you know what I mean  
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean, it was so dismal  
Women all standing with shock on their faces  
Sad description, oh I was looking for you  
  
Everyone was singing, girl is washed up  
On Redondo beach and everyone is so sad  
I was looking for you, are you gone, gone?  
  
Pretty little girl, everyone cried  
She was the victim of sweet suicide  
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean it was so dismal  
Women all standing with shock on their faces  
Sad description, oh I was just looking for you  
  
Desk clerk told me girl was washed up  
Was small, an angel with apple blonde hair, now  
I went looking for you, are you gone, gone?  
  
Picked up my key, didn't reply  
Went to my room, started to cry  
You were small, an angel, are you gone, gone?  
  
Down by the ocean it was so dismal  
I was just standing with shock on my face  
The Hearse pulled away and the girl that had died, it was you  
  
You'll never return into my arms 'cause you were gone, gone  
Never return into my arms 'cause you were gone, gone  
Gone, gone  
Gone, gone  
Goodbye

I feel upset.  
Let's do some celebrating.  
Come on honey, don't hesitate now.  
Needed you, you withdrew, I was so forsaken.  
Ah, but now the tables have turned, my move.  
I believe I'll be taking my revenge.  
Sweet revenge.  
I thought you were some perfect read-out.  
Some d-digital delay had obscured  
And phased my view of the wicked hand you played.  
Ah, the sands and hands of time have run out, run out, ah you better face it.  
Ah, this thing's run amok, this luck  
I do know how to replace it with revenge.  
Oh, sweet revenge.  
I gave you a wristwatch, baby.  
You wouldn't even give me the time of day.  
You want to know what makes me tick.  
Now it's me that's got precious little to say.  
For the ghosts of our love have dried have died.  
There's no use faking it.  
Ah, the spirits gonna close in on you tonight.  
High time I was taking my revenge.  
Sweet revenge.  
Revenge. Revenge.  
all the gold and silver couldn't measure up my love for you. it's so
immaterial. I don't wait around for you. [ ] [ ] nobody gets anything. nobody
gets nothing. no [ ] don't leave me no space in your little boat you ain't
gonna need no you ain't gonna need no little boat you are living on my time my
dear.  
Revenge. Sweet revenge. Sweet sweet revenge. . .

[Originally by The Doors]  
  
Well, the clock says it's time to close now  
I guess I'd better go now  
I'd really like to stay here all night  
The cars crawl past all stuffed with eyes  
Street lights share their hollow glow  
Your brain seems bruised with numb surprise  
Still one place to go  
Still one place to go  
  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves  
  
Well, your fingers weave quick minarets  
Speak in secret alphabets  
I light another cigarette  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
Learn to forget, learn to forget  
  
Let me sleep all night in your soul kitchen  
Warm my mind near your gentle stove  
Turn me out and I'll wander baby  
Stumblin' in the neon groves  
  
Well the clock says it's time to close now  
I know I have to go now  
I really want to stay here  
All night, all night, all night

I looked upon the book of life  
Tracing the lines of face after face  
Looking down at their naked feet  
Bound in chains bound in chains  
Chains of leather chains of gold  
We knew it was wrong but we looked away  
And paraded them down the colonial streets  
And that's how they became enslaved  
  
They came across on the great ships  
Mothers separated from their babes  
Husbands stood on the auction block  
Bound in chains bound in chains  
Chains of leather chains of gold  
Men knew it was wrong but they looked away  
And led them to toil in fields of white  
As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape  
  
Oh the people I hear them calling  
Am I not a man and a brother  
Am I not a woman and a sister  
  
History sends us such strange messengers  
They come down through time  
To embrace to enrage  
And in their arms even stranger fruit  
And they swing from the trees  
With their vision in flames  
Ropes of leather ropes of gold  
Men knew it was wrong but they looked away  
Messengers swinging from twisted rope  
As they turned their necks to a bitter landscape  
  
Oh the people I hear them calling  
Am I not a man and a brother  
Am I not a woman and a sister  
We will be heard we will be heard

I took a walk out to the sun But I just, just couldn't take it  
I followed a dream It was circular  
But I just, just could not fake it  
  
Step to the left the left the left Step to the right the right the right  
Pick up the sign the sign the sign For a stride of the mind the mind  
  
Simon of the desert blew into town On the scalding tail of a bright cold wind  
Slipped through the sand Footprints emerged  
Where no one was walking Simon had been  
  
Dropped from heaven To a ready made world  
Said I'm no Sufi But I'll give it a whirl  
We booked passage on the Book of the Dead  
Time to travel Simon said  
  
Step to the left the left the left Step to the right the right the right  
Pick up the sign the sign the sign On the stride of the mind the mind the mind  
  
Come on move where dreams increase Where every man is a masterpiece  
If you want to be counted As another kind  
And you're true, pursue Stride of the mind the mind the mind...  
  
He bowed three times Removed his fez  
Pointed to heaven And Simon says  
The mind the mind the mind Pick up the sign the mind the mind  
It's a vertical climb the climb the climb Stride of the mind the mind the mind  
Pick up the sign the sign the sign It's a vertical climb the climb  
Take it in stride

I was down in Georgia  
Nothing was as real  
As the street beneath my feet  
Descending into air  
  
The cauldron was a-bubbling  
The flesh was lean  
And the women moved forward  
Like piranhas in a stream  
They spread themselves before me  
An offering so sweet  
And they beckoned and they beckoned  
Come on darling eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
They circled around me  
Natives in a ring  
And I saw their souls a-withering  
Like snakes in chains  
And they wrapped themselves around me  
Ummm what a treat  
And they rattled their tales hissin'  
Come on let's eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
I felt a rising in my throat  
The girls a-saying grace  
And the air the viscous air  
Pressed against my face  
And it all got too damn much for me  
Just got too damn rough  
And I pushed away my plate  
And said boys I've had enough  
And I laid upon the table  
Another piece of meat  
And I opened up my veins to them  
And said come on eat  
  
Eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
You eat the summer cannibals  
Eat eat eat  
  
'Cause I was down in Georgia  
Nothing was as real  
As the street beneath my feet  
Descending into hell  
  
So eat eat eat  
You eat eat eat  
You eat eat eat  
Eat eat eat

Little blue dreamer go to sleep  
Let's close our eyes and call the deep  
Slumbering land that just begins  
When day is done the little dreamer spins  
  
First take my hand now let it go  
Little blue boy you're on your own  
Little blue wings as those feet fly  
Little blue shoes that walk across the sky  
  
May your path be your own  
But I'm with you  
And each day that you grow  
He'll be there too  
And someday when you've grown  
We'll follow you  
As you grow  
As you grow  
  
Little blue star that offers light  
Little blue bird that offers flight  
Little blue path where those feet fall  
Little blue dreamer won't you dream it all  
  
Refrain  
  
And in your travels you will see  
Warrior wings think of Daddy  
And if a mama bird you see  
Folding her wings will you remember me  
  
Refrain  
  
As you grow  
As you grow

This is the girl  
For whom all tears fall  
This is the girl  
Who was having a ball  
Just a dark smear masking the eyes  
Spirited away, hurrying inside  
  
This is the girl  
That crossed the bind  
This is the song about smothering vine  
Twisted as laurels to crown her head  
Raised as a reef upon her bed  
  
This is the girl  
This the blind that turned in wine  
This is the wine of the house, it is said  
This is the girl who yearned to be heard  
So much for cradling a smouldering bird  
  
This is the girl  
This is the girl  
  
This is the girl  
For whom all tears fall  
This is thegdirl  
Who was having a ball  
This is the girl  
For whom all tears have shed  
This is the wine of the house, it is said  
  
This the blind that turned in wine  
This is the wine of the house, it is said  
This is the girl who yearned to be heard  
So much for cradling a smouldering bird  
  
This is the girl  
This is the girl  
This is the girl

Life is designed  
With unfinished lines  
That another sings  
Each story unfolds  
Like it was gold  
Upon a ragged wing  
  
The bold and the fair  
Suffer their share  
He whispered to his kin  
All of my debts  
Left with regrets  
I'm sorry for everything  
  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Winding as they may  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Hope to mend them one day  
  
And she pinned back her hair  
Shouldered with care  
The burdens that were his  
Mending the coat  
That hung on the post  
In heart remembering  
  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Winding as they may  
Trespasses stretch like broken fences  
Hope to mend them one day  
  
And her time was to come  
Called to her son  
This your song to sing  
All of our debts  
Wove with regrets  
Upon a golden string  
And he found the old coat  
Hung on a post  
Like a ragged wing  
And took as his own  
The sewn and unsown  
Joyfully whistling

Up there  
There's a ball of fire  
Some call it the spirit  
Some call it the sun  
Its energies are not for hire  
It serves man  
It serves everyone  
Down there where Jonah wails  
In the healing water  
In the ready depths  
Twisting like silver swans  
No line of death no boundaries  
  
Up there  
The eye is hollow  
The eye is winking  
The winds ablaze  
Angels howling  
The sphinx awakens  
But what can she say  
You'd be amazed  
  
Down there  
Your days are numbers  
Nothing to fear  
There will be trumpets  
There will be silence  
In the end the end  
Will be here just here  
  
Ah the borders of heaven  
Are zipped up tight tonight  
The abstract streets  
The lights like some switched on Mondrian  
Cats like us are obsolete  
Hey Man don't breathe on my feet  
Thieves, poets we're inside out  
And everybody's a soldier  
Angels howl at those abstract lights  
And the borders of heaven  
Are zipped up tight tonight  
  
Up there  
There's a ball of fire  
Some call it the spirit  
Some call it the sun  
Its energies are not for hire  
It serves man  
It serves everyone  
The air we breathe  
The flame of wisdom  
The earth we grind  
The beckoning sea  
It's no mystery  
Not sentimental  
Ah the equation  
It's all elemental  
  
The world is restless  
Heaven in flux  
Angels appear  
From the bright storm  
Out of the shadows  
Up there, down there  
But what can we say  
Man's been forewarned  
  
All communion is not holy  
Even those that fall  
They can prophet understanding  
It's all for man  
It's for everyone  
It's up there, down there  
Everywhere  
Everywhere  
Time for communion  
Time for communion  
Talking communion

Hail brother  
The distant thunder  
Is nothing but hearts  
Beating as one  
Dance of a million  
On God's pavilion  
Come come  
Beat on your drum  
  
Awake people arise  
Awake upright come  
Fortune is falling like  
Tears from the skies  
Open your eyes  
  
Hail sister  
Come on over  
To shape reshape  
Things to come  
Bow your head  
Raise your lantern  
Come come  
Beat on your drum  
  
Awake people arise  
Awake upright come  
Fortune is falling like  
Tears from the skies  
Open your eyes  
  
United action is what we need  
Time to say that everything is going to be  
Wasted icons wasted lives  
Like war obsolete  
  
Awake people arise  
Awake upright come  
Fortune is falling like  
Tears from the skies  
Open your eyes  
  
These are the times  
The times of our own  
These are the shapes  
The world we formed  
Swift is the arrow  
Dark is the thorn  
The slate is clean  
The future awaits  
Awake

I walk it up  
I walk it down  
I know not what I do  
  
Your love is a sword  
Made of folded gold  
In the shape of my heart  
  
I walk it up  
Walkin' blind  
Walkin' blind  
  
All I heard was him  
All I saw were eyes  
By the world begun  
  
I walk it down  
Walkin' blind  
Walkin' blind  
  
Angel falling, angel blessed  
Sister how fair is your love  
I know not what I do  
  
Walkin' blind  
Walkin' blind  
  
From the face of love to love  
From the face of love to love

Hi. hi. I was running after you for a long time.  
I, I was watching you from  
Actually I've watched you for a long time.  
I like to watch you when you're walking  
Back and forth on the beach.  
And the way your the way your cloth looks.  
I like I like to see the edges  
The bottom of it  
Get all wet when you're walking near the water there.  
It's real nice to talk to you.  
I didn't. I-I-I-I-I, how are you? how are you?  
(oh albino)  
I saw I saw you from your balcony window  
And you were standing there waving at everybody  
It was really great because there was about  
A billion people there, but when I was waving to you,  
Uh, the way your face was, it was so, the way your face was  
It made me feel exactly like we're  
It's not that you were just waving to me, but  
That we were we were waving to each other.  
Really it was really wonderful  
I really felt happy  
It really made me happy  
And. um. I. I just wanted to thank you  
Because  
You  
You really really you made me  
You made me feel good  
And  
Oh I, it's nothing.  
I um. I. well I'm just clumsy.  
Yeah.  
No, it's just a band aid.  
No, it's ok.  
Oh no, I'm always doing  
Something's always happening to me  
Yeah. well. I'll be seein' ya.  
Goodbye. bye.  
  
Wave thou art pretty.  
Wave thou art high  
Wave thou are music  
Wave thou are white  
(oh albino)  
(oh albino)  
Wave thou art high  
(wave thou art pretty)  
Wave to the city  
Wave  
Goodbye.  
Goodbye sir.  
Goodbye papa.

We three kings of orient are, bearing gifts we traverse afar  
Field and fountain, moor and mountain, following yonder star.  
  
Oh, star of wonder, star of night, star with royal beauty bright.  
Westward leading, still proceeding,  
Guide with thy perfect light.  
  
Born a King on Bethlehem's plain,  
Gold I bring to crown him again  
King for ever, ceasing never over us all to reign. .....  
  
Frankincense to offer have I, incense owns a Deity nigh  
Pray'are and praising, all men raising,  
Worship him, God most high, oh.....  
  
Myrrh is mine, its bitter perfume breathes a life of  
gathering gloom.  
Sorrowing, sighing, bleeding, dying, sealed in the stone cold tomb.  
  
(all Glorious now behold him arise, king and God and sacrifice  
Alleluia, alleluia, heaven to earth replies...

In a room in Lebanon  
They silently slept  
They were dreaming crazy dreams  
In foreign alphabet  
Lucky young boys  
Cross on the main  
The driver was approaching  
The American zone  
The waving of hands  
The tiniest train  
They never dreamed  
They'd never wake again  
  
Voice of the Swarm  
We follow we fall  
Some kneel for priests  
Some wail at walls  
Flag on a match head  
God or the law  
And they'll all go together  
Where duty calls  
  
United children  
Child of Iran  
Parallel prayers  
Baseball Koran  
I'll protect Mama  
I'll lie awake  
I'll die for Allah  
In a holy war  
I'll be a ranger  
I'll guard the streams  
I'll be a soldier  
A sleeping Marine  
  
Refrain  
  
In the heart of the ancient  
Ali smiles  
In the soul of the desert  
The sun blooms  
Awake  
Into the glare of all out little wars  
Who pray to return to salute  
The coming and dying of the moon  
Oh sleeping sun  
  
Assassin in prayer  
Laid a compass deep  
Exploding dawn  
And himself as well  
Their eyes for his eyes  
Their breath for his breath  
All to his end  
  
And a room in Lebanon  
Dust of scenes  
Erase and blend  
May the blanket of Kings  
Cover them and him  
  
Forgive them Father  
They know not what they do  
From the vast portals  
Of their consciousness  
They're calling to you

Hello friend, I've come a callin'  
Passively stationed, active patrol  
Slidin' in at high noon like some reluctant sheriff  
Not wanna get involved in it all  
Who stands guard for each other?  
Why must we guard anything at all?  
Anything at all  
From the earth's four corners the people are calling  
Forming equations but the questions are hard  
All men are brothers, killing each other  
And Mother Earth is wringing in wonder  
Who stands guard for each other?  
Oh, why must we guard anything at all?  
Anything at all  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away  
There's a cross on the road, there's a great mill turnin'  
Some seeking answers, some born to dancers  
You can hold on the blade and turn around forever  
Be flung into space into another kind of grace  
Who stands guard for each other?  
Oh, why must we guard anything at all?  
Anything at all  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away now  
Whirl away  
Give [Incomprehensible]  
Some giveth their hand  
Some giveth their land  
Some giveth their life  
You lay in the fields of grain, the staff of life all around you  
But yet you, you will cut someone down  
For their possessions, some material thing  
And our children they're being blown away like wishes in the wind  
For the sake of their coat  
Or the colors of their coat  
Or the color of their skin  
Or the name on their shoes  
And the mother cries  
"Why they taken my son?"  
And the father wonders  
"Are they taking my boy?"  
He extended his hand  
He gave them his land  
He gave them his bread  
He gave them his heart  
Said, "Hello friend"  
Hello friend  
Hello friend  
Hello friend  

Wild leaves are falling  
Falling to the ground  
Every leaf a moment  
A light upon the crown  
That we'll all be wearing  
In a time unbound  
And wild leaves are falling  
Falling to the ground  
Every word that's spoken  
Every word decreed  
Every spell that's broken  
Every golden deed  
All the parts we're playing  
Binding as the reed  
And wild leaves are falling  
Wild wild leaves  
As the campfire's burning  
As the fire ignites  
All the moments turning  
In the stormy bright  
Well enough the churning  
When enough believe  
The coming and the going  
Wild wild leaves  
Wild wild leaves  
Wild wild leaves  

We were talking  
About the space between us all  
And the people  
Who hide themselves behind a wall  
Of illusion, never glimpse the truth  
Then it's far too late, when they pass away  
We were talking  
About the love we all could share  
When we find it  
To try our best to hold it there  
With our love, with our love  
We could save the world if they only knew  
Try to realize it's all within yourself  
No one else can make you change  
And to see you're really only very small  
And life flows on within you and without you  
We were talking  
About the love that's gone so cold  
And the people  
Who gain the world and lose their soul  
They don't know, they can't see  
Are you one of them?  
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find  
Peace of mind is waiting there  
And the time will come when you see we're all one  
And life flows on within you and without you
