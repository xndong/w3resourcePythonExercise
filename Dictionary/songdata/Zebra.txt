In the middle of winter  
The trees are bare and the bears are hibernating  
The only sound in the forest  
Is the sound of snow heard crashing to the ground  
And in the middle of loving  
I hope you'll find a place in your heart for them  
They really can't do us any harm  
It is only us who can do harm to them  
  
But there's an animal that winter won't affect at all  
He sits by fireplaces waiting for the winter's fall  
He owns guns and oh you know he's got that gun in his hand  
He's a man and oh he's got that precious thing in his hand  
  
So in the middle of loving  
I hope you'll find a place in your heart for them  
When it's cold and the grass is gold  
All the animals take shelter as they hide  
And when an animal can't find shelter  
Some time winter takes over and he dies  
  
But there's an animal that winter won't affect at all  
He sits by fireplaces waiting for the winter's fall  
He owns guns and oh you know he's got that gun in his hand  
He's a man and oh he hold's that precious life in his hand

The time is now or never  
The crashing is coming near  
The delphi is on the corner  
And he whispers in your ear  
It used to be men could be solemn even while laughing  
And laughter could be heard shore to shore  
But no more  
Now all you hear is crying  
Cause no one's on the phone  
Your feet are just now freezing over  
You know that you are here all alone  
It used to be men could be solemn even while laughing  
And laughter could be heard shore to shore  
But no more  
When I think of friends and places  
Things we wanted, hoped we'd be  
All that's left is fading traces  
Memories of what use to be  
Hear their laughter, see their shadows  
Feel the darkness, see the light  
We had lit all but lost so quickly  
We think we won but we lost the fight  
But it's all the same to me  
I've seen all I want to see  
First they laugh at you  
Then they cry  
Say they'll always be there  
Then they die  
So alone yet so alive  
It used to be men could be solemn even while laughing  
And laughter could be heard shore to shore  
But no more  
  
  

Nothing to say no place to hide  
I can't find a good reason even to lie  
All of our dreams are gone  
I may not be right but I'm surely not wrong  
And it's gonna be hard  
So very, very hard living without you  
Well don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Nowhere to go, no place to run  
We started out just having fun  
Well, I never cared too much  
Not till the going got so very rough  
And it's gonna be hard  
So very, very hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Well, don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Baby don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Well, don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Baby don't you know that it's  
Hard living without you  
Don't you know that it's  
  

You wake up in the morning  
And you're not feeling quite the same  
You feel a gentle hand upon you  
But you seem to have forgotten her name  
You put on your clothes  
You're heading home  
You're hoping and praying you  
Won't be all alone  
Chorus:  
When you get there  
When you get there  
You haven't had a chance to think  
About explaining where you slept till noon  
You can't say you were working all night  
Cause it's Sunday afternoon  
The truth is too hard  
You'll never come back  
'Cause a one night stand is not  
Worth the attack  
Chorus:  
When you get there  
When you get there  
You're walking up to our front door  
As my face comes into view  
You think you've got a pretty good lie  
You say you slept at Mary Lou's  
You open the door  
You start telling lies  
But then from the hall  
You hear Mary Lou cry  
Chorus:  
When you get there  
When you get there  
When you get there  
When you get there  
  

Why am I here all alone  
I'm gettin' growing pains  
And I'm feeling so old  
I'm gettin' tired,  
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand  
Now life has taken its toll  
And now my sanity's gettin' harder to hold  
I'm kinda tired  
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand  
Now don't take advice from a stranger  
You can't live your life by what others do  
We're all here alive for a reason  
You'll never know  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
How can I make it alone?  
It's such a crazy world,  
And I'm feelin' so stoned  
I'm kinda tired  
Walkin' in the rain, sleepin' in the sand  
Just sleepin' in the sand  
You can't see the light from an angel  
You can't add the price of what others do  
We're all here alive for a reason  
You'll never know  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
You'll never know just what it means  
You'll never know just what it was  
  
  

You rest your mind  
Flying to the home that you knew  
You made you past  
Trying to get home in as few but  
All the time  
Your mind is just aching for  
All the time  
You can't stop but faking it  
All the time  
Your mind is just breaking your heart  
You rest you heart  
Oh, listen to me  
You can be 'bout, anywhere  
You can take you mind anyplace because  
Your mind's open, the rest is up to you  
You can dream 'bout any dream  
You can take safaris right up into the sky's open,  
The rest is up to you  
You can do it  
You can dream it all  
Sing it in your heart  
Don't have to be lonely  
You can do it  
You can feel it all  
Breakin' in your heart  
Don't have to be lonely  
You can do it  
You can leave it all  
Make another start  
You can be 'bout, anywhere  
You can take you mind anyplace because  
Your mind's open, the rest is up to you  
You can dream 'bout any dream  
You can take safaris right up into the sky's open,  
The rest is up to you  
Might wind up just anywhere  
Might wind up just anywhere  
Might wind up just anywhere  
  

Don't' do anything I wouldn't do  
Pass me anyway, like I'm a fool for you  
Passionate anyway  
Walkin' out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
It's just becoming unreal  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing critical  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
It's not unusual  
It's only tearing you apart  
Don't' do anything I wouldn't do  
Pass me anyway, lie like a fool  
Laugh at me anyway  
Walkin' out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
It's just becoming unreal  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing critical  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
It's not unusual  
It's only tearing you apart  
Oh, how can I be  
So far away  
Without a reason?  
Should I know  
How not to lose?  
How can I not  
Follow you anywhere?  
But I'm lost  
Take me away!  
Takin' all my time, make me a choice  
Passionate anyway  
Walkin' out the back door  
Used to be alive until just now  
It's just becoming unreal  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing critical  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
You can't believe it to be  
The thing that's tearing you apart  
You're only losing your heart  
It's nothing visual  
You won't believe it till it starts  
You're only losing your heart  
The thing you're dreamin' of is  
The thing that's tearing you apart  
Even though I'm wasting my time
