A man is in love, how do I know?  
He came and walked with me, and he told me so  
In a song he sang, and then I knew  
A man is in love with you  
  
A man is in love, how did I hear?  
I heard him talk too much whenever you're near  
He whispered your name when his eyes were closed  
A man is in love and he knows  
  
A man is in love, how did I guess?  
I figuered it out while he was watching you dress  
He'd give you his all, if you'd but agree  
A man is in love and he's me

How did he come here?  
Who gave him the key?  
Slipped in his hand  
So secretly  
Who put the colour  
Like lines on his face  
And brought him here  
To a pagan place?  
Who shot the arrow?  
How high did it fly?  
When he tipped it  
With poison  
Did he even know why?  
What unseen hand  
Brought him  
Face to face to face to face with  
All this and more  
In a pagan place?  
Come into my parlour  
Sail in at my shore  
Drink my soul dry  
There is always more  
There is always more after  
Now fly on my carpet  
Look into my face  
And see the  
Heart of Man  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
In a Pagan  
Pagan....

I don't drink as much as I used to  
'Cause lately that just ain't my style.  
And the hard times don't hurt like they ought'a  
They pass quickly like when I was a child.  
  
And lately I've learnt how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
In the magic that morning is bringing  
There's a song for the life I have found  
  
It keeps my feet on the ground  
  
Now the midsummer days ain't so heady  
They just drift like a breeze through my mind.  
And nothing appears in a hurry  
As if to make up for some old long-lost time  
  
And lately I've learnt how to listen  
To a sound like the sun going down  
In the magic that morning is bringing  
There's a song for the friends I have found  
  
They keep my feet on the ground  
They keep my feet on the ground  
They keep my feet on the ground

All the things  
All the things she gave me  
All the things  
All the things she gave me  
I wrapped them up  
In a big brown box  
Tied it with ribbon  
Drove to the docks  
Checked my time  
By the old town clock  
All the things...  
I saw the watchman  
He was blowing into  
Cupped hands  
As he walked to the car  
He said "Where do you think  
You're drivin' to son?  
All good folks are in bed  
The day's work is done"  
I said I'm just lookin' for  
Someplace to burn  
All the things  
All the things that she...  
All the things that she gave me  
Where do I put them  
Where can I hide them  
Where I won't have to see them?  
It's dark as hell here  
This city's gown cold  
The devil's in drag  
Playing poker with souls  
The lots are all empty  
The last man's out  
The moon's made of cheese  
And God is a boy scout  
When I go to sleep  
I'll be dreaming about  
All the things...  
Then I'll dream about  
Churches with  
Great tall spires  
Cathedrals and candles  
Chimneys and choirs  
I'll dream about  
That place  
Where I set fire  
All the things  
All the things that she...

Well the dawn is howling and the mainframe shakes  
Feel like I've been sleeping in a cellar full of snakes  
My wings have been clipped my shoes have been stuck with glue  
Well if you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
  
Now I've got goons on my landing thieves on my trail  
Nazis on my telephone willing me to fail  
They were all sent by someone (obviously well I know it was) you!  
Well if you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
  
I've a bucketful of Babylon I got a handful of lead  
I'm gonna put them in a gun man point it at your head  
Because you stole all my friends and you gave me the buffalo blues  
Well if you'll be my enemy I'll be my enemy too  
  
Now from the slime on your tongue to the nails on your toes  
From the scales on your skin to the stains on your clothes  
You're gonna have to make me do something that I do not want to do  
But if you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
  
My hands are tied I'm nailed to the floor  
Feel like I'm knocking on the unknown door  
There's a gun at my back a blade at my throat  
I keep finding hate mail in the pockets of my coat  
Well I've been trying to grow I been cooling my heels  
I've have been working the treadmill I've been working in the fields  
And I can't get to sleep I can't catch my breath  
I can't stop talking and I look like death  
But I will put right this disgrace I will rearrange you  
If you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
If you'll be my enemy I'll be your enemy too  
Be my enemy!

I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
  
My soul the sky, my heart a sun  
my mind a world - my only one  
My thoughts the people, the world around  
My dreams the kings - or the clowns  
  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
  
The continents and the seven oceans  
bound the range of my emotions  
My time is long but not forever  
My moods are the changing wind and weather  
  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
I'm starting to see a bigger picture  
I'm beginning to color it in  
  
Color it in !  
Color it in !

Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in,  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all into my heart  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all into my heart  
  
Bring the little fishes  
Bring the sharks  
Bring 'em from the brightness  
Bring 'em from the dark  
  
Bring 'em from the caverns  
Bring 'em from the heights  
Bring 'em from the shadows  
Stand 'em in the light  
  
Bring 'em out of purdah  
Bring 'em out of store  
Bring 'em out of hiding  
Lay them at my door  
  
Bring the unforgiven  
Bring the unredeemed  
Bring the lost, the nameless  
Let 'em all be seen  
Bring 'em out of exile  
Bring 'em out of sleep  
Bring 'em to the portal  
Lay them at my feet  
  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in,  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all into my heart  
Bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in, bring 'em all in  
Bring 'em all in,bring 'em all in to my heart

Bye bye shadow lands  
The term is over  
And all the holidays have begun  
Now she walks on fresh fields  
Her tracks are on the land  
She is everywhere and noplace  
When its dark and evening falls  
She moves among men  
They would seek to have her  
As a prize  
But she is in the shadows  
Ocean and the sand  
She is everywhere and noplace  
Her church not made with hands  
Not contained by man  
She dancing high as clouds  
Faster than the arrow  
Straight as any crow that flies  
Across great seas she travels  
Up through rising lands  
She is everywhere and noplace  
Her church not made with hands  
Isn't that a pretty sun  
Setting in a pretty sky?  
Will we stay and watch it darken  
The church not made with hands  
Not contained by man  
That precious place  
Unmade  
By man

Come live with me and be my love  
Share my bread and wine  
Be a part of me, the heart of me  
Be mine  
Come live with me and be my love  
Let our dreams combine  
Be wife to me, be life to me  
Be mine  
With these hands I will build a roof  
To shield your head  
And with these hands I will carve the wood  
For our baby's bed  
Come live with me and be my love  
And let me love you all the time  
Be mate to me, be fate to me  
Be mine  
I will try to do my best for you  
I swear, I promise you  
I will cry for you, I will comfort you  
My whole life through  
Come live with me and be my love  
Share my bread and wine  
Be a part of me, be the heart of me  
Be mine

(Bob Dylan)  
When you are sad and you are lonesome  
And you just can't find a friend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
And when all that you've held sacred  
Falls down and does not mend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No, not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Now, when you're standing at a crossroads  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
And when all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's around the bend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No, not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
The tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright lights of salvation shine  
In dark and empty skies  
When the cities are on fire  
With the burning flesh of men  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No, not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Now when the rain-clouds gather around you  
And the heavy rain descends  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
And if nobody is close beside you  
With a soulful hands to lend  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No, not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
Not the end  
No, not the end  
Just remember  
Death is not the end  
  

December is the cruelest month  
But this time for once my cheeks are warm  
After long years in the monkey-house  
I am ready for the storm  
Let them throw all their cannonballs  
Let all their strongmen come  
I'm ready to go anywhere  
Through venom, sick and scum!  
  
December isn't always cold  
But this year she's mine and I know why  
Somewhere a flower has to grow  
For every flower that dies  
I'm stricken with fever  
But my heart is strong as steel  
I'm ready to go anywhere!  
I can believe, I can feel!  
  
December is a trusted friend  
I always recognise her face  
It's a plague of fool blown aside  
Forever by her soft and silent grace  
She is reckless as a mayday  
Gentle as a stone  
And ready to go anywhere  
To carry me back home!  
  
December fell deep in the bleak  
Mid-winter time when jesus christ  
Howled a baby saviour's howl  
A primal truth as pure as ice  
And though we crucified him on a cross  
And dragged his name from payer to curse  
He was able to go anywhere  
He was almost one of us!  

Well here we are in a special place  
What are you gonna do here?  
Now we stand in a special place  
What will you do here?  
What show of soul are we gonna get from you?  
It could be deliverance, or history  
Under these skies so blue  
Could be something true  
But if I know you you'll bang the drum  
Like monkeys do  
Here we are in a fabulous place  
What are you gonna dream here?  
We are standing in this fabulous place  
What are you gonna play here?  
I know you love the high life, you love to leap around  
You love to beat your chest and make your sound  
But not here man - this is sacred ground  
With a Power flowing through  
And if know you you'll bang the drum  
Like monkeys do  
Here we stand on a rocky shore  
Your father stood here before you  
I can see his ghost explore you  
I can feel the sea implore you  
Not to pass on by  
Not to walk on by  
And not to try  
Just to let it come  
Don't bang the drum  
Just let it come  
Don't bang the drum  
Just let it come  
Don't bang the drum  
Do you know how to let it come now?  
Don't bang the drum  
Just let it come now...  
Don't bang the drum...  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum  
Don't bang the drum

I'm dumbing down the world  
Yes, I'm dumbing down the world  
And my head is held high  
And the glint in my eye  
And my arrogance rumbles before me  
  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my thoughts are banal  
Like a stagnant canal  
And my sycophants shamble behind me  
  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my hour is come around, is come around !  
Yes my hour is come around, it's come around...  
  
Look around !  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
And my works are designed  
To suck blood from your mind  
For your energy feeds and sustains me  
  
I'm dumbing down the world  
Dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world  
I'm dumbing down the world and I love it !

I wish I was a fisherman  
Tumblin' on the seas  
Far away from dry land  
And it's bitter memories  
  
Castin' out my sweet line  
With abandonment and love  
No ceiling bearin' down on me  
Except the starry sky above  
  
With light in my head  
With you in my arms...  
I wish I was the brakeman  
On a hurtlin fevered train  
  
Crashin head long into the heartland  
Like a cannon in the rain  
With the feelin of the sleepers  
And the burnin of the coal  
  
Countin the towns flashin by  
And a night that's full of soul  
With light in my head  
With you in my arms...  
  
And I know I will be loosened  
From the bonds that hold me fast  
And the chains all around me  
Will fall away at last  
  
And on that grand and fateful day  
I will take thee in my hand  
I will ride on a train  
I will be the fisherman  
  
With light in my head  
You in my arms...  
Light in my head  
You in my arms...  
  
Light in my head  
You...  
With light in my head  
You in my arms...

Drop your guns  
and hear the news  
The war is won  
and we've called a truce  
The key is found  
and the circle complete  
And the higher ground  
is beneath our feet  
  
Like the turn of a page  
or a change of gear  
A brand new age  
is already here  
And even while  
men pursue their doom  
A magical child  
is kicking in the womb  
  
I'm preparing for birth  
I'm not the only one  
I'm a part of the Earth  
I'm a drop of the Sun  
I'm in step with the stars  
I'm in a league with the land  
I'm a functioning part of the Master's Plan!

Well, if I get to heaven before you do  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
I'll be watching and waiting, mother dear, for you  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
Father, when the train, father, when the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train, father, when the train comes along  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
Well, if my eyes see the glory before yours do  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
I'll be watching and waiting, father, for you  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
Father, when the train, father, when the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
Father, when the train, father, when the train comes along  
I will meet you at the station when your train comes along  
Now if my feet touch the home line before yours do  
I will meet you at the station when the train comes along  
I'll be watching and waiting, my brother, for you  
I will meet you at the station when the train comes along  
When the train, when the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train, when the train comes along  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train, when the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
When the train, when the train comes along  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
Now if you see God's country before I do  
Will you meet me at the station when my train comes along?  
Will you be there watching, sister, for me?  
Will you meet me at the station when my train comes along?  
When my train, when my train  
Meet me at the station when my train comes along  
When my train, sister, when my train comes along  
Will you meet me at the station when my train comes along?  
When the train, when the train  
Meet me at the station when my train comes along  
When the train, oh, when the train  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  
Meet me at the station when the train comes along  

The mountain is steep  
the ditches are deep  
The task in hand  
is making us weep  
But here's a promise  
(I intend to keep  
  
That I mean to keep)  
Seed it in your mind  
and say it each night  
Before you sleep:  
we will climb higher in time  
(och!)  
  
You've got a head full of trouble  
and a ship to build  
(You think you won't make it  
but you know you will  
You feel you need your  
cup refilled  
Fill it out of mine  
we'll drop the defenses,  
Pool our skill  
  
Your heart you're hiding  
it's making you ill  
You feel like you want to have your  
sporran refilled  
Well, fill it out of mine  
let the soulful water  
Overspill)  
and we will climb higher in time  
  
I've been to the bottom  
I've been on the train  
I've slept in the gutter  
with my head in a drain  
I've been brutally proud  
I've been mortally shamed  
But this is not a crime  
I'm just learning, my friends,  
That it's all in the game  
and we will climb higher in time  
(Och!)  
  
Climb higher in time  
climb higher in time

He lives in a waste  
Void of culture and taste  
His eye on a prize beyond  
His every word  
Is in the right place  
But his word is not his bond  
  
His face his comely  
His heart it bleeds  
Yet it's but a mantle he has donned  
Mark him only  
By his deeds  
For his word is not his bond  
  
I'd love to take him  
Out of his room  
And gently break him  
I'd love to see  
Him dance!  
  
His protege deals  
In confusion and fog  
Of power he is fond  
  
Wheels within wheels  
Like master, like dog  
His word is not his bond  
  
I'm trying to swim  
But I'm caught in the shallows  
And I sense that I've been conned  
Deliver him  
To the gallows!  
His word is not his bond

Where will I wander and wonder  
Nobody knows  
But wherever I'm a-going I'll go  
In search of a rose  
  
Whatever the will of the weather  
And whether it shines or snows  
Wherever I'm a-going I'll go  
In search of a rose  
  
I don't know where it's found  
I don't mind  
As long as the world spins around  
I'll take my time  
  
I'll savour the softness of summer  
I'll wrap up when winter blows  
And wherever I'm going I'll go  
In search of a rose

Is she really wide awake  
Is she conscious  
Of her beautiful mistake  
Is she conscious  
As she moves among the crowd  
  
She's got the world upon a piece of string  
She's got the world upon a piece of string, it's so  
He was ugly and she was beautiful  
He was ugly and she was so...  
  
Is she conscious  
Is she asleep or just afloat  
Is she conscious  
Of the letter that she wrote  
Is she conscious  
Of the muzak in her ears  
  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes, it's so  
He was ugly and she was beautiful  
He was ugly and she was so...  
  
Is she conscious  
As she sways across the room  
Is she conscious  
Of the weeping of the moon  
Is she conscious  
As she leaves the door ajar  
Is she conscious  
As she gets into the car  
  
I don't even want to say her name  
I don't even want to say her name, that's all  
I want to sing it from the toppest top  
I want to sing it from the toppest top, that's all  
  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes  
The Queen of Sheba could have shined her shoes, it's so  
He was ugly and she was beautiful  
He was ugly and she was so...  
  
Is she conscious  
Of the chauffeur as he drives  
Is she conscious  
As the ambulance arrives

Can I believe my ears?  
Is this really you?  
Pacing the floor with one eye on the door  
Watching the winners go through  
Why do you hang back now?  
Why d'you hesitate?  
You fires don't burn  
For he who waits  
  
Out of all of the people  
That I ever knew  
If one should have made it  
It should have been you!  
  
I know who I'm looking for  
But I don't believe my eyes  
The sight of you with your head hung low  
Is a sick, sad surprise  
Why do you hang back now?  
Why d'you hesitate?  
How dare you throw it all away then tell me  
Aw man it must be fate  
  
Out of all of the people  
That I ever knew  
There had to one I could believe in  
And it should have been you!  
  
A gift that dies is a tragic thing  
And it happens all the time  
But a gift that's wasted, thrown to hell is the  
Worst of stupid crimes!  
I saw you hang back now!  
I watched you hesitate!  
You're a well respected man, but bullshit!  
You could've been great!  
  
Out of all the people  
I ever knew  
There should have been one  
And it should have been you!  
  
I spent my whole life  
Looking for someone like you!

Such a sad procession  
Winding down the lane  
What a strange impression  
Was branded on my brain  
  
A band was playing endless mindless  
It was like a hooligan's lament  
It was dumb but it was timeless  
I still wonder what it meant  
  
But whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
"Behold the lights of London"  
The skipper said as his hands shook,  
His aura eaten by his jealousy  
And all the drugs he took  
He said "This is the real world, Buddy  
  
Toughen up your ass or it'll break"  
I said "I'm not your buddy, Buddy  
And your real world is a fake"  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
The D.J. took his vengeance  
As the weeding guests arrive  
  
There was malice in his handshake,  
Quicksand in his eyes  
As he slunk across the courtyard  
From far-off I heard a horn  
Somewhere in the bleak mid-distance  
Something beautiful is born  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
I stumbled down a street of shadows  
A black hallelujah split the night  
Anarchists and priests were playing strip jack  
Underneath the crude lamplight  
I came upon a weeping soldier  
He said "I'm all washed up now hush !"  
But when I glanced across his shoulder  
He held the royal flush  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
I'm still here, I'm still breathing  
I'm who I thought I was or just about  
I'll be walking down this boulevard  
Until my legs give out  
  
Thoughts like storms and seas are raging  
I know it is a matter of degree  
But it's not the world outside that's changing  
It's me  
  
And whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected over me  
  
Whatever needs to happen  
Let it happen, let it be  
Through all I am protected  
Grace is effected  
Over me

I'm sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill inn the distance  
Summer on the way  
Blue skies and sailing boats  
Like a picture in a book  
I can't believe I got here  
Or how long it took  
Living one step at a time  
Putting one foot in front of the other  
It sure feels right  
Healing on my mind  
Been a long way  
Been a long way to the light  
I'd made it to Manhattan  
Built myself a nest  
I meant to get right back to doing  
Exactly what I do best  
Pluggin' in an electric guitar  
Leading a band  
Well, if you want to give God a laugh  
Tell him your plans!  
Summer in the city  
Wilting in the heat  
Buzzing up and down to Bearsville  
And back to Hudson Street  
I learned meditation  
And how to visualize  
Just breathing, being still  
Never felt more alive!  
Living one step at a time...  
I spent the fall in transit  
Circling the moon  
Like a cat on a hot tin roof  
Like a fiddle without a tune  
I found what I was searching for  
In Mrs Caddy's book  
I had to go there straightaway  
Have myself a look  
I flew back to Scotland  
Anticipation in my bones  
The old country welcoming me  
Like a prodigal coming home  
I knelt and kissed the tarmac  
In the wild Atlantic rain  
Felt the fiery Gaelic blood  
Rising in my veins  
Living one step at a time...  
I spent the night in Glasgow  
Flew to Inverness  
I found the place and at the first  
I was not impressed  
Nobody said hello  
The faces left me cold  
Back then how was I to know  
All that would unfold?  
I entered the Sanctuary  
Heard the voice of a girl  
Sending out a circle of light  
Clear across the world  
I shuddered in the Power  
Like a seedling in a storm  
I've been traveling to this place  
Since the moment I was born  
Flew back to New York City  
Singing the big city blues  
The sand of Findhorn Bay  
Still clingin' to my shoes  
I tried to re-start my life  
But the life I knew was gone  
I had to let go everything  
But that's another song!  
Living one step at a time...  
So I'm sitting in my bedroom  
Overlooking Findhorn Bay  
Cluny Hill in the distance  
Summer on the way  
I'm watching sailing boats  
Bobbing to and fro  
Time to hit the road  
The only way I know...  
Living one step at a time...

Behold the flashing waters  
A cloven dancing jet  
That from the milk-white marble  
For ever foam and fret  
Far off in drowsy valleys  
Where the meadow saffrons blow  
The feet of summer dabble  
In their coiling calm and slow  
The banks are worn forever  
By a people sadly gay  
A Titan with loud laughter  
Made them of fire clay  
Go ask the springing flowers  
And the flowing air above  
What are the twin-born waters  
And they'll answer Death and Love  
  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
Two lonely spirits wait  
With wreaths of withered flowers  
'Fore paradise's gate.  
They may not pass the portal  
Poor earth-enkindled pair  
Though sad is many a spirit  
To pass and leave them there  
Still staring at their flowers  
That dull and faded are  
If one should rise beside thee  
The other is not far  
Go ask the youngest angel  
She will say with bated breath  
By the door of Mary's garden  
Are the spirits Love and Death

So you crashed the plane  
And there's hell to pay  
I'm making it plain  
I love you anyway  
  
You made a fool  
Out of me today  
I'm breaking the rule  
I love you anyway  
  
You threw the blame  
What a role to play!  
My story's the same  
I love you anyway  
  
You dealt the blow  
And you burst the ball  
I'm letting you know  
I love you most of all  
  
Magic we chase only to find  
It comes from a place higher than mind  
Higher than dust, but only just  
It hangs on the cusp  
  
I can hear you scream  
Like a branded slave  
It's only a dream  
I love you anyway  
  
You've got a war to wage  
Chief to obey  
Foe to engage  
I love you anyway  
  
You hunker down  
Feeling small  
Judging the clown  
I love you most of all  
  
I picture you with the eye of my mind  
A portrait in blue, unravaged by time  
Beauty undimmed and through your pale skin  
The beauty within  
  
So you beat the child  
Sent him away  
Beauty defiled  
I love you anyway  
  
You tricked the King  
Cut him where he lay  
Unthinkable thing  
I love you anyway  
  
You held the jewel  
And you let it fall  
Prince of a fool!  
I love you most of all  
  
Over the wind, under the hill  
wing upon wing, love over will  
When the big me meets the big you  
The things we will do!  
  
I'll make the time  
If you name the day  
Trouble or shine  
I love you anyway  
  
I think of you  
As child of clay  
Whatever you do  
I love yo anyway

There's a black wind blowing  
A typhoon on the rise  
Pummelin' rain  
Murderous skies!  
I'm gonna take my books  
I'm gonna wear my coat  
I'm gonna find my scarf  
And wrap it around my throat  
And you can  
Come with me  
Through the drivin' snow  
We're gonna ride on up to  
Medicine Bow  
Well I spent too long  
Just stuck on the shore  
There's a man in my head  
But he isn't me any more  
I'm gonna find me a ship  
Stowaway on a boat  
I'm gonna burn all the words  
And letters and cards that I ever wrote  
And you can  
Sail with me  
Where the current flows  
We're gonna move on up to  
Medicine Bow  
I'm gonna change my colors  
Cancel my things  
Stop my squawkin'  
Grow some wings!  
Well I will not sleep  
And I will not rest  
I will put my soul  
And my will to the test  
I'm gonna tug at my tether  
I'm gonna tear on my lead  
I'm gonna test my knowledge  
In the field of deeds  
And you can  
Run with me  
Fast as we can go  
Over the hills to  
Medicine Bow

I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
I'm in love all over again  
I'm head over heels  
I can't even begin  
to tell you how it feels  
She lives on a rock  
surrounded by light  
She's young and she's wild  
and she's treating me right  
  
I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
I shed some light  
I change my address  
I haven't felt so great  
since I first went west  
I've got brilliant intentions  
unthinkable plans  
I've got sparks and electric shocks  
just exploding from my hands  
  
I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream  
  
I'm back in the saddle  
I'm out in the clear  
I got no regrets  
I've got nothing to fear  
I've battled my demons  
come out on top  
I'm gonna love you as hard as I can  
never gonna stop  
  
I'm preparing to fly  
under my own steam  
I'm preparing to fly  
into a dream

I never meant to cause you any trouble  
I never meant to cause you any pain  
I only ever wanted to see you laughing  
Only want to see you laughing in the purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Only want to see you underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey, I never wanted to be your wicked lover  
Only wanted to be some kind of friend  
I could never leave you for another  
It's such a shame our friendship had to end  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Only wanted to see you underneath the purple rain  
  
Honey, I know, I know, I know times are changing  
This time we all reach out for something new  
That means you too  
You say you're looking for a leader,  
But you can't seem to make up your mind  
But you better open it up wide, let it guide you  
To the purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Purple rain, purple rain  
Only want to see you, baby, in the purple rain

She is so beautiful  
I've got no words to describe  
The way she makes me feel inside  
I'm flying solo  
  
As free as light as a bird  
yet I could lay my wings down in a moment  
To guard and comfort her  
She is so beautiful  
  
light-filled, loving and wise  
Laughter dancing in her eyes  
All my road is before me  
And I never did plan on a wife  
  
Yet she's the most beautiful soul  
I ever have met in this life  
For she is like a song  
She is like a ray of light  
  
She is like children praying  
Like harps and bells and cymbals playing  
And she is like a wind  
Moving, soothing, bringing joy  
  
And here am I, destroyed  
She is so beautiful  
I don't know what I'm going to do when I leave  
Except grieve

Seven O'clock in the morning and I'm riding the overnight train  
I've got ten tonnes of luggage but I left it behind when I came  
I look at my watch, says September seventeen  
We're riding past some place where I've never been  
And I'm waving through the window as we go  
Somebody says "Well, hey, what are you waving at?"  
Well what have I got to lose  
Somebody might wave back  
  
Seven O'clock in the morning and I'm carrying bags under my eyes  
Been awake all night, counting the hours to sunrise  
(Drawing patterns, beating rhythms) on the tabletop  
I lift my gaze and my mouth just dropped  
Someone waving in the window at me  
And I say "Hey there, what are you waving at?"  
When he says "What do I have to lose,  
Somebody might wave back"  
What do I have to lose,  
Somebody might wave back

Something that is gone  
Something that is gone  
Something that I had just yesterday  
But where I must have laid it  
I really couldn't say  
Something that was right  
But now is wrong  
Something that is gone  
  
Something that I lost  
Something that I lost  
Something that I cradled in my hand  
Something rather special  
That pertained to all my plans  
I'm left here wondering what on earth it was  
Something that I lost  
  
Something that I missed  
Something that I missed  
I've looked all around my room  
But it's not here  
How can a thing of permanence  
So swiftly disappear ?  
Something is the cause of all of this  
Something that I missed

Here is the smell  
Of seafood pie  
A broken tower  
On the open sky  
  
A chain of islands  
Rolling West  
In sight of the house  
Where we are guests  
  
A rambling old river  
Twist through the fields  
Ancient names  
Imprinted on shields  
  
Gifts arrive  
For a baby girl  
Born a queen  
At the end of the world  
  
Furious music  
From an open door  
The sound of feet  
Beating on a stone flood  
  
Always the wind  
Always the form  
Of an elder God  
Hooved and horned  
  
The head of the mountain  
Lost in a cloud  
A country woman  
Soft and proud  
  
Into the bay  
The horses swirl  
For we come to the sea  
At the end of the world

Spiritual thought

Blood of the world, Mother of mine  
Gonna see you rise higher in time  
Blood of the world, Mother of mine  
Gonna see you rise higher in time  
Blood of the world, Mother of mine  
Gonna see you rise higher in time  
Blood of the world, mother of mine  
Open your eyes and let 'em shine !

[Chorus]  
I'm gonna suffer for you no longer  
I'm gonna suffer for you no more  
I'm gonna write you out of my life  
And shut the door  
  
You tried to drive a wedge between me and my friends  
You pushed me to the edge time and again  
I've been living in your shade since I can't remember when  
Now I'm bringing this charade to an end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was subtlety and skill in your manipulative ways  
You chipped away my will so you could make me stay  
You soothed me with your voice until I obeyed  
But I'm making my own choice from today  
  
You used the tongue of love like a boxer uses fists  
You contained me like a glove or a creeping cloak of mist  
You guaranteed the stars but there always was a twist  
Now I see you as you are, Egotist !  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got a ticket in my hand and I must be moving on  
But I want you to understand that from the moment I am gone  
I release and let you go, you owe nothing now to me  
I'm not angry anymore, I'm free !  
  
[Chorus]

I have heard the big music  
And I'll never be the same  
Something so pure  
Hey!  
Just called my name  
I have drowned in the big sea  
Now I find I'm still alive  
And I'm comin' up for ever  
Hey!  
Shadows all behind me  
Ecstasy to come  
I have climbed the big tree  
Touched the big sky  
I just stuck my hand up in the air  
And everything came into color  
Like Jazz manna  
From sweet sweet chariots  
I have seen the big mountain  
And I swear I'm half way there  
(You'll never get there, you'll never get there  
You'll never get there)  
But I will  
I will always climb the mountain  
Because I have heard the big music  
And I'll never be the same  
Something so pure  
Hey!  
Has called my name!

(American Indian Chant)  
The old man said  
the earth only endures  
You spoke truly  
you were right  
  
The old man said  
the earth only endures  
You spoke truly  
you were right  
  
Only the mountains live forever  
only the earth endures  
only the earth endures  
only the earth endures  
only the earth endures  
  
The old man said  
the earth only endures  
You spoke truly  
you were right  
you were right  
you were right

Do you see them coming through fields of snow?  
Do you see them riding through fields of snow?  
One rides for a woman who has no name  
One rides for a king  
And one just rides and rides and rides and rides  
For the girl in the swing  
  
They race like phantoms in the Belmont light  
You see them follow the Belmont light  
They ride through places where the walls are white  
Where the noble voices of women sing  
A brace of thanks and silent night  
And a song for the girl in the swing  
  
Well, you just asked me do I know what love is  
Well, sure I know, sure I know what love is  
It's the thief of sleep, a boy and his dog  
A red rubber ball, these old foolish things  
A rain that falls a long, long way from home  
It lives in the girl in the swing!  
It lives in the girl in the swing...

I dreamed about Jimi Hendrix  
He came back for one day  
Was born weepin' out of an egg  
The mid-wife said  
And straight away began to pray  
With lifted head  
  
He spent the early hours  
Communing with the morning stars  
And then he came over to my house  
Where he tried out my guitar  
  
He was young and black and beautiful  
Big eyed, perfect skin an'  
He played my guitar like a lightning storm  
Like twirlin' feathers in the wind  
He could make it sound like the end of the world  
A fire, the flick of a knife  
He could squeeze it slow and masterful  
Like the hand that brought the world to life  
  
Together we strolled in sculptured gardens  
Passed the sleepy afternoon  
Maids were dartin' back and forth  
From a window came a violin tune  
Angels, dressed as nurses toyed with playin' cards  
Looters sprung from prisons filled the yard  
  
A yellow sun hung low and dawned,  
And as it dipped  
Jimi stood up straight, grinned  
And shook his velvet hips  
  
Callin' himself King Electric  
In the evening he went wild  
Played on a dozen stages  
In the clubs of New York -  
Lit the city end to end  
Wired it up, fired it up  
Scarved, bejewelled, long-legged, snake-limbed  
Athletic, driven, dangerous  
  
He made all Manhattan shake  
And every street and sidewalk quake  
His stratocaster caused the mighty Empire State  
To vibrate  
His whammy bar caused shock-eyed punks from  
Hackensack and Yonkers  
Raised on speed, metal and rap  
To enter trance and levitate  
  
He played Purple Haze and Pyramid,  
Voodoo Child and Sin-E,  
Up From the Skies and Storm Free  
In King Tut's Wah-Wah hut  
  
He did a forty-two minute  
Cosmic rise I

I stood upon the balcony with my brand new bride  
The clink of bells came drifting down the mountainside  
When in our sight something moved  
Lightning eyed and cloven hoofed,  
The great god Pan is alive!  
  
He moves amid the modern world in disguise  
It's possible to look into his immortal eyes  
He's like a man you'd meet anyplace  
Until you recognize that ancient face  
The great god Pan is alive!  
  
At sea on a ship in a thunder storm  
On the very night that Christ was born  
A sailor heard from overhead  
A mighty voice cry

I'm the three day man  
It's three days too long  
Everything is in its right place but  
Something is wrong  
Time is on wheels  
And my legs shake  
I have to live with every decision  
That you make  
  
And that doesn't mean  
That I'll be your slave  
It doesn't mean you're here to stay  
It doesn't mean we're friends for life  
You know I want you  
You know that I love you  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
  
Sixes and sevens  
Oh how it rains  
Sleep is a station  
Life is a train  
People snatch instinctively for  
Whatever crutch they need  
But I promise not to abuse you  
If you don't love me leave  
  
And that means  
That I'll be never your slave  
It means that you're not here to stay  
Means that we're not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
  
And that means  
That I'll be never your slave  
It means you're not here to stay  
Means we're not friends for life  
You know how I want you  
You know that I love you  
  
But I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
Never need you anyway  
I'll never need you anyway  
I'll never need you!

I'm too tired to deceive you  
We can't pretend there's nothing wrong  
Who'll be first to say it?  
That the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back  
When we talk of old acquaintance and  
Speak like two strangers all day long  
The only four words that I hear  
Are: the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back  
When evening fall Magenta  
And goodnight hangs on and on  
I won't need to go to sleep and dream  
To tell me  
That the thrill is gone  
And we never get it back

I pictured a rainbow  
You held it in your hands  
I had flashes  
But you saw the plan  
I wandered out in the world for years  
While you just stayed in your room  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon  
  
You were there in the turnstiles  
With the wind at your heels  
You stretched for the stars  
And you know how it feels  
To reach too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
  
I was grounded  
While you filled the skies  
I was dumbfounded by truth  
You cut through lies  
  
I saw the rain dirty valley  
You saw Brigadoon  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon!  
  
I spoke about wings  
You just flew  
I wondered I guessed and I tried  
You just knew  
I sighed  
... but you swooned!  
I saw the crescent  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
With a torch in your pocket  
And the wind at your heels  
You climbed on the ladder  
And you know how it feels  
To get too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon  
The whole of the moon!  
  
Unicorns and cannonballs  
Palaces and piers  
Trumpets towers and tenements  
Wide oceans full of tears  
Flags rags ferryboats  
Scimitars and scarves  
Every precious dream and vision  
Underneath the stars  
  
Yes you climbed on the ladder  
With the wind in your sails  
You came like a comet  
Blazing your trail  
Too high  
Too far  
Too soon  
You saw the whole of the moon

These things you keep  
You'd better throw them away  
You wanna turn your back  
On your soulless days  
Once you were tethered  
And now you are free  
Once you were tethered  
Well now you are free  
That was the river  
This is the sea!  
  
Now if you're feelin' weary  
If you've been alone too long  
Maybe you've been suffering from  
A few too many  
Plans that have gone wrong  
And you're trying to remember  
How fine your life used to be  
Running around banging your drum  
Like it's 1973  
Well that was the river  
This is the sea!  
Wooo!  
  
Now you say you've got trouble  
You say you've got pain  
You say've got nothing left to believe in  
Nothing to hold on to  
Nothing to trust  
Nothing but chains  
You're scouring your conscience  
Raking through your memories  
Scouring your conscience  
Raking through your memories  
But that was the river  
This is the sea yeah!  
  
Now I can see you wavering  
As you try to decide  
You've got a war in your head  
And it's tearing you up inside  
You're trying to make sense  
Of something that you just can't see  
Trying to make sense now  
And you know you once held the key  
But that was the river  
And this is the sea!  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah!  
  
Now I hear there's a train  
It's coming on down the line  
It's yours if you hurry  
You've got still enough time  
And you don't need no ticket  
And you don't pay no fee  
No you don't need no ticket  
You don't pay no fee  
Because that was the river  
And this is the sea!  
  
Behold the sea!

All your trouble will be over, so will your pain  
you are gonna see those blue skies bursting right through the rain  
The higher you climb, the lower you fall  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Now in the morning you can cry all you want to  
We'll spend the whole day weeping  
Right now I want you to lay down your weary head  
and let me see you sleeping  
You've been walking around baby, inflamed and ashamed  
feeling like you're one inch tall  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
You're way too hard on yourself baby  
You got some pretty basic things wrong  
You wouldn't believe me if I told you why I wrote you into this song  
You're looking at your heart baby, and you're calling it black  
But like Icarus and like Saul  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Now I know this hurt you're feeling  
I've felt these same things too  
I've got spaces way down deep inside of me that are just the same as you  
You want to wrap your arms around your head, turn out the lights  
And roll yourself into a ball  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
Are you blinded by the brilliance?  
Are you dazzled by the Light?  
Why is it I see nothing but emptiness in your tired beaten eyes  
That once were bright  
I know you just can't help but run when you hear that sweet voice call  
You got too close to heaven, that's all  
  
I walked a mile for you baby  
So won't you smile for me baby?

You just stepped into the main track  
climbed down off the fence  
Words are your weapon  
lies are your defense  
I know what you want  
and I see what you see  
You're looking for somebody  
but he isn't me  
Find yourself another  
because we will not be lovers  
How your eyes are like tortures  
and your presence is bliss  
I never knew time  
could speed and zip like this  
The touch of your flesh  
is tough to resist  
Planets collide, collide  
at the smack of your kiss  
But you can kiss your brother  
because we will not be lovers  
Now you're pulling down curtains  
You've been sparking old flames  
You've been causing disturbance  
crying for shame  
You've been Knocking on doors  
You've been abusing my name  
You've been casting up doubt  
you've been throwing your blame  
But you can throw it at your mother  
we will not be lovers  
Now the world's full of trouble  
everybody's scared  
The landlords are frowning  
cupboards are bare  
People are scrambling  
like dogs for a share  
It's cruel and its hard  
but it nothing compared to  
what we do to each other  
to each other  
We will not be lovers!  
we will not be lovers, no  
We will not be lovers, no

When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
You have your eye on Jimmy  
Long Jimmy Lee  
You have your eye on Jimmy  
And a fine man he  
  
You have your eye on Jimmy  
But you'd better let him be  
Because when you go, Molly-O  
You'll be gone with me  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
You have your eye on Johnny  
Thin Johnny Fee  
You have your eye on Johnny  
And a fine man he  
  
You have your eye on Johnny  
But you'd better let him be  
'Cause when you go, Molly-O  
You'll be gone with me  
  
When will we be married Molly?  
When will we be wed?  
When will we be bedded in the same bed?  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
I made a black bow for your pretty head  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
Made a black bow for your bonny head  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed  
  
When will we be married Molly  
When will we be wed  
When will we be bedded in the same bed

Now he's brought down the rain  
And the Indian summer is through  
In the morning you'll be following your trail again  
Fair play to you  
  
You ain't calling me to join you  
And I'm spoken for anyway  
But I will cry when ye go away  
I will cry when ye go away  
  
Your beauty is familiar  
And your voice is like a key  
That opens up my soul  
And torches up a fire inside of me  
  
Your coat is made of magic  
And around your table angels play  
And I will cry when ye go away  
I will cry when ye go away  
  
Somebody left his whisky  
And the night is very young  
I've got some to say and more to tell  
And the words will soon be spilling from my tongue  
  
I will rave and I will ramble  
I'll do everything but make you stay  
Then I will cry when ye go away  
I will cry when ye go away  
  
When ye go away...  
When ye go away...

Willows were swaying  
The water was rippling  
The froggies were singing  
  
Along with the laughing at the bank  
We have the moon to thank  
For this lovely scene we might never have seen  
If it hadn't been for the moon  
  
Why look at that moon?  
  
Away up high, seeing everything  
That goes by, why look at that moon  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
  
Sitting in the desert  
Beneath a lonesome sky  
Cool, my oh my, it would be  
  
If it never have been above  
That fateful little boy  
That one who has beheld  
True love through history  
  
Why must it start?  
Why must the lovers part?  
And why does the cheatin' go on?  
Why have hearts turned to stone?  
  
Why look at that moon?  
  
Away up high, seeing everything  
That goes by, why look at that moon  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
Why, why, why look at the moon?  
  
Why look at that moon?  
Ain't it grand?  
Why look at that moon?  
Helps me understand  
  
Why look at that moon?  
Inspirator of many a dream  
Why look at that moon?

Well it's got nothing to do with anything that is real  
You just believe in it and it's true  
You can sooth like an angel or sigh like a saint  
You can dream it and see it through  
You will live to see a sea of lights  
Sparking on the face of a pearl  
Climb your own peak  
Find a new streak  
  
Get yourself along to the world party (party!)  
Now you've been building for yourself a cool place in the sand  
You're thinking that it's mighty fine  
You've got dust in your eyeballs, you got mud in your mouth  
But it's your head, it ain't mine  
I've got a madman of my own to contend with  
Cursing in the cave of my skull  
Turn the other cheek  
Find a new streak  
  
Get yourself along to the world party (party!)  
Well I heard a rumour of a golden age  
Somewhere back along the line  
Maybe I dreamed it in a whisper or  
Heard it in a spell  
It was something to do with the sign of the times  
And the only thing that I remember  
Is a summer like a pretty girl  
Who shimmers and shines  
Moving in time  
Shaking to the beat of the heart of the world  
  
Party (party! party! party! party! party! party! party! party! party!)
