In the day we sweat it out in the streets of a runaway American dream  
At night we ride through mansions of glory in suicide machines  
Sprung from cages out on highway 9,  
Chrome wheeled, fuel injected and steppin' out over the line  
Baby this town rips the bones from your back  
It's a death trap, it's a suicide rap  
We gotta get out while we're young  
'Cause tramps like us, baby we were born to run  
Wendy let me in I want to be your friend  
I want to guard your dreams and visions  
Just wrap your legs round these velvet rims  
and strap your hands across my engines  
Together we could break this trap  
We'll run till we drop, baby we'll never go back  
Will you walk with me out on the wire  
'Cause baby I'm just a scared and lonely rider  
But I gotta find out how it feels  
I want to know if love is wild, girl I want to know if love is real  
  
Beyond the Palace hemi-powered drones scream down the boulevard  
The girls comb their hair in rearview mirrors  
And the boys try to look so hard  
The amusement park rises bold and stark  
Kids are huddled on the beach in a mist  
I want to die with you Wendy on the streets tonight  
In an everlasting kiss  
  
The highway's jammed with broken heroes on a last chance power drive  
Everybody's out on the run tonight but there's no place left to hide  
Together Wendy we'll live with the sadness  
I'll love you with all the madness in my soul  
Someday girl I don't know when we're gonna get to that place  
Where we really want to go and we'll walk in the sun  
But till then tramps like us baby we were born to run

Wow!  
  
On again, ... Are you still smoking now? ... Are you still smoking?  
  
I don't care what you do honey  
You can even spend my money... Now  
This boring night has passed me by  
I'm Sick and tired just getting high  
  
Life is hard and mean and tough  
But sometimes love is not enough  
  
I don't wanna spend all my days  
Rolling around in a Purple Haze, Purple Haze.  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
Delirious  
  
I can see your body getting sicker girl  
From all those devil pills and liquor  
And in your head, its in a mess  
So stop all this destructiveness  
  
Delirious, Delirious, Delirious, Delirious.  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
I might as well get me a gun but when all is said and done  
Life can be fun, life can be fun  
  
Delirious  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
Life is hard and mean and tough  
But sometimes love is not enough  
  
I don't wanna spend all my days  
Rolling around in a Purple Haze, Purple Haze.  
  
Now... And Go.. Its still smoking  
  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
You make me Delirious but I could never get serious over you  
  
Delirious, Delirious, Delirious, Delirious  
  
You may be Delirious

For you to live, just golden days, golden days, golden days  
So celebrate the moment now, have all that you desire  
[Chorus:]  
We'll keep each other warm, together we'll weather the storm  
The children are dying and nobody's crying  
There's got to be something out there, someone who cares  
Got to be something out there  
Give me real life, the worry and the strife  
I'll throw it out of the window, to the dogs below  
So come with me I'll guide you through wardrobes of fantasy  
And treasure chests of what could be  
A world without anxiety  
A legacy of golden days, golden days, golden days  
Leave it all behind the blind leading the blind  
Have all that you desire  
Gotta be, gotta be someone out there  
Let's break the rules scattering the jewels  
Of joy amongst ourselves  
The lonely, lonely of the shelves  
Feel good about yourself, I'll drink to your health  
Have all that you desire  
[Chorus]  
I'm looking for something, and I don't know what it is

I'm going back to find some peace of mind in San Jose.  
  
Fame and fortune is a magnet.  
It can pull you far away from home  
With a dream in your heart you're never alone.  
Dreams turn into dust and blow away  
And there you are without a friend  
You pack your car and ride away  
  
I've got lots of friends in San Jose  
Do you know the way to San Jose?  
Can't wait to get back to San Jose.

From diamond mine to the factory  
Everybody's doing what you've got to keep on doing for society  
Make this world a good place to be  
Let livin' be but don't work for free  
Playing isn't paying so work is what I'm saying  
Working for the world go round  
The battle cry don't mess with me  
I've traveled the world for eternity  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors of the wasteland  
  
It seems to me that the powers that be  
Keep themselves in splendour and security  
Armoured cars for megastars  
No streets, no bars, yours wealth is ours  
They make the masses, kiss their assets  
Lower class jackass, pay me tax take out the trash  
Working for the world go round  
Your job is gold, do as you're told  
They pay you less then run for congress  
  
Warriors of the wasteland  
Sailboats of ice on desert sands  
Warriors - what a waste, man  
I'm working for the world go round, go round  
  
Diamond mine to the factory, yeah  
Make this a world, a good place to be  
  
Warriors - what a waste, man  
  
Warriors  
  
We're rats in a cage  
  
Suicide a go go

Watching the wildlife  
On my way home, the state of Rome  
People gliding on the floor  
Pleased with life not needing more  
Sunset on the river  
People go home in the rain  
Familiar faces on the train  
Running scared, and staying sane  
  
If you live by the sword  
Well that's your own reward  
So don't walk with me  
Watching the wildlife  
The beast within you  
Eats your heart out  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
Boys in the backyard  
The girls are hanging out the lines  
Washing the day, wash your troubles away  
It's game we have to play  
Ghosts are chasing you round  
Things that happen in the past  
Don't make that mistake again  
The sun beats down the streets of passion  
  
If you live by the sword  
Well that's your own reward  
So don't talk with me  
Watching the wildlife  
The beast within you  
Eats your heart out  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
Your own worst enemy  
Get free from hate and get in love  
  
If you live by the sword  
Watching the wildlife  
Watching you  
The beast within you too  
Watching the wildlife  
  
Get in love, get in love  
  
Watching the wildlife  
We all live in a dream in home  
We watch TV and drive a car  
We go outside, but not too far  
Watching the wildlife  
We walk the water like a sun  
Living cuts you like a knife  
Living here watching the Wildlife  
  
Get in love, get in love
