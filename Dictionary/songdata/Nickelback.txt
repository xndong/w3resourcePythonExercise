Hey who's coming with me, to kick a hole in the sky?  
I love the whiskey, let's drink that shit til it's dry.  
So grab a Jim Beam, JD, whatever you need.  
Have a shot from the bottle, doesn't matter to me.  
'Nother round, fill 'er up, hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!  
  
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.  
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out. (Bottoms up)  
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.  
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.  
'Nother round, fill 'er up,  
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! Ooh, bottoms up.  
  
So grab your best friends and make your way to the bar.  
But keep your distance, we're gonna light it on fire.  
We're drinking black tooth, eighty proof, straight gasoline.  
Slam as much as you can take and hand the bottle to me.  
'Nother round, fill 'er up,  
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!  
  
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.  
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out. (Bottoms up)  
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.  
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.  
'Nother round, fill 'er up,  
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! Ooh, bottoms up.  
  
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.  
We ain't gonna stop until they throw us all out.  
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.  
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.  
  
This is what it's all about, no one can slow us down.  
We ain't gonna stop until the clock runs out. (Bottoms up)  
Hell can't handle all of us, so get your bottles up.  
Drinkin' every drop until it all runs out.  
'Nother round, fill 'er up,  
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up!  
  
'Nother round, fill 'er up,  
Hammer down, grab a cup, bottoms up! Hey! Bottoms up.

Two men  
They started walking  
Started talking 'bout better days  
One says to the other  
We do it all again  
Seems I knew I would  
And now I found it  
Found I got it  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me see  
Now I feel it  
Feel like I've been there  
I didn't need this  
Somebody help me breathe  
  
Here we are again  
Just face to facing  
Each other another day  
Who wins  
Well who cares  
It always ends up the same  
Seems I knew I would  
  
And now I found it  
Found I got it  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me see  
And now I feel it  
Feel that I've been there  
I didn't need this  
Would somebody help me stand  
And now I've told them  
Already warned them  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me breathe  
  
If I was them  
Then I want to be  
What I see  
If I could drag my life in a moment  
Want to know do you want me to go  
Gonna keep it all from ending  
Never stop myself from pretending  
That you always knew that I never could  
  
All I ever really wanted was to be the same  
Equal treatment never ever comes  
And there they go again  
All I ever really wanted was to be like you  
So perfect  
So worthless  
If I could take it all back think again  
I would  
  
And now I found it  
Found I got it  
I didn't want this  
Somebody help me see  
Now I feel it  
Feel that I've been there  
I didn't need this  
Somebody help me stand  
And now I've told them  
I didn't want this  
I didn't need this  
Would somebody help me breathe  
Would somebody help me breathe  
Would somebody help me?

Have I gone all too far?  
Have I been here before?  
If I have let me know  
How it goes  
Take her place  
And I will  
See her face  
No reason  
Let it slide  
And I will  
Watch her die...  
To run through fields  
To find, and I will  
Hold, then lead, then lie  
And I will...no I won't  
  
Is it now really time?  
Can I just give mine, if  
I can simply trade  
Deal made  
  
Take her place  
And I will  
See her face  
No reason  
Let it slide  
And I will  
  
Watch her die...  
To run through fields  
To find, and I will  
Hold, then lead, then lie  
And I will...no I won't  
  
Run, hide away from me  
Desouled, to seek, decide  
And I will, no I won't  
  
Run through fields to find  
Hold then lead, then lie  
And I will  
Run, desouled, and  
Hold, to heal, to find  
And I can't

Bribing me, We come, We watched how  
We're last to throw our pennies  
A passive tramps lifts her skirt  
And asks us then we throw them down to her  
  
And I know why I will always follow you  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
  
We don't want to live in the sun  
Just to keep them happy for awhile  
Midnight, and Frank freaks out and reaches God and  
Fairly tied up too  
  
But I know why I will always follow you  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
And I remember wanting to be you  
And pray to God that we would all pull through  
Cause I know why I will always follow you  
If you're my brother, then I will follow you  
  
Lifelong friends threw bottle ends  
And yell in the air like lifelong enemies  
Who's stronger, who's lived longer?  
World quarrels and grandkids on your knee  
  
Cause I know I will always follow  
Anywhere my brother leads me to  
And I remember wanting to be you  
And pray to God that we would all pull through  
Cause I know why I will always follow you  
If you're my brother, then I will follow you  
  
Cause I know why I will always follow  
I will follow you and I will  
I know why I will always follow  
I will follow you and I will

And you see much better than I see  
And you know all that I'm thinking  
To define or redefine too slow  
And it seems all that I'm sinking  
Running through the deep  
Gonna find the backwoods  
I found out  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
  
And you bleed much better than I bleed  
And you've shown all that is so good  
And your word, much better than my word  
And you stand right where a hole should  
  
Running through the deep  
Gonna find the backwoods  
I found out  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
  
To feel divine  
To hold onto ones self  
To give and to give and  
To never receive by myself  
  
Running through the deep (I want it)  
Gonna find the backwoods (I need it)  
I found out (much more than he did)  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
(give it back somehow)  
Giving some (I'm ready to forgive now)  
  
Running through the deep  
Gonna find the backwoods  
I found out  
All day long who will be the big men giving some  
Running through the deep gonna find the back backwoods  
I found out gonna get it gonna get it  
All day long who will be the big men  
Are you really really gonna get it

I asked you to stay  
But you said there's no way  
I begged -- you call  
And you leave me after all  
I know I'm not to blame  
I know you don't feel the same  
Didn't even tell me why  
You just left me here to die  
  
I stand, I fall, I bounce off these four walls  
You laugh, you leave  
And you leave me here alone,  
Is this how its gonna be  
It's fine for you and not for me  
Did you even care at all  
You stand, I fall  
  
I'm guilty too  
Giving up to you  
Well, that's my one sin  
Sorry for giving in  
Didn't mean to waste your time  
Thanks for wasting mine  
Could have to tried to let me be  
Would you just set me free?  
  
I stand, I fall, I bounce off these four walls  
You laugh, you leave  
And you leave me here alone  
Is this how its gonna be  
It's fine for you and not for me  
Did you even care at all  
You stand, I fall  
  
Could I pay you not to...

You say you don't want it  
Just watch and you'll flaunt it  
You stare at the ceiling  
And ignore what I'm feeling  
  
Well that's fine' hey I don't mind  
I can find nothing wrong with it  
And you say in your polite way  
Oh by the way can you get on with it  
  
Now that I've seen  
Not really diggin' this!  
  
Did I ask for your input  
How's the taste of your own foot  
To speak and not be right  
You'd like to just rewrite  
My life and take what you like  
And decide with all of it  
And to know that if it goes right  
You'll never find out if I wanted it  
  
Now that I've seen  
Not really diggin' this!  
Now that I know  
Not really diggin' this!  
  
Called him twice today  
They said he went away  
I never wondered why  
They tried to hold him  
Ain't never comin' back  
Pull out the welcome mat  
I never wondered why  
They tried to hold him  
  
The way that its goin'  
To laugh without knowin'  
The way that I'm feelin'  
Inside is unappealin'  
  
Well that's fine' hey I don't mind  
I can find nothing wrong with it  
And you say in your polite way  
Oh by the way can you get on with it  
  
Now that I've seen  
Not really diggin' this!  
Now that I know  
Not really diggin' this!  
Not really diggin' this!

Well, you can dig me up a grave  
And try and stick me in the ground  
Well, you can tie me to the bed  
And try and beat me half to death  
But you can never keep me down  
Well, you can stick me in a hole  
And you can pray all day for rain  
You can shoot me in the leg  
Just to try to make me beg  
And you can leave me there for days  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I'll stay alive  
Just to follow you home, yeah  
And I will survive, mmm  
'Cause you're my Mississippi princess  
You're my California queen  
Like the duchess of Detroit  
And every city in between  
You can slap me in the face  
And you can scream profanity  
Leave me here to die alone, but  
I'll still follow you home  
I'll still follow you home  
  
You can make a couple calls  
And tell your brothers I'm in town  
Put a bounty on my head  
And tell my parents that I'm dead  
And hope to hell I'm never found  
You can steal me the keys  
To your daddy's Cadillac  
You can tamper with the brakes  
Call it a mistake  
And pray I'm never coming back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
C'mon, mmm, oh  
  
(You can dig me up a grave  
And try and stick me in the ground  
You can tie me to the bed  
And try and beat me half to death  
But you can never keep me down)  
  
And I will survive  
'Cause you're my Mississippi princess  
You're my California queen  
Like the duchess of Detroit  
And every city in between  
You can slap me in the face  
And you can scream profanity  
Leave me here to die alone, but  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home (I'll still follow you home)  
I'll still follow you home

Lost it on the chesterfield  
Or maybe on  
A gamblin' wheel  
Lost it in a diamond mine  
It's dark as hell  
And hard to find  
You can climb to the  
Top of the highest tree  
You can look around  
But you still won't see  
What I'm lookin' for  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?  
Well I still don't know  
  
Out in the back  
In the old corn field  
Underneath the tractor wheel  
Thought I'd dig  
Till I'd found it first  
Broke my back  
And died of thirst  
You can bribe the devil  
You can pray to God  
You can sell off  
Everything you got  
And you still won't know  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?  
And you still don't know  
  
Saw it on the silver screen  
Preacher says  
"Don't know what it means"  
Last page ad  
In a comic book  
Bought me a map  
Showed me where to look  
It ain't carved of stone  
Or made of wood  
And if you paid for it  
Then it's still no good  
And you still won't know  
What I'm looking for  
  
Where the good times gone?  
Where the good times gone?  
All the stupid fun  
And all that shit we've done  
Where the good times gone?

This time I wonder what it feels like  
To find the one in this life  
The one we all dream of  
But dreams just aren't enough  
So I'll be waiting for the real thing  
I'll know it by the feeling  
The moment when we're meeting  
Will play out like a scene straight off the silver screen  
So I'll be holdin' my breath  
Right up to the end  
Until that moment when  
I find the one that I'll spend forever with  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there.  
'Cause everyone wants to feel like someone cares.  
Someone to love with my life in their hands.  
There's gotta be somebody for me like that.  
'Cause nobody wants to go it on their own  
And everyone wants to know they're not alone.  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere.  
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.  
  
Tonight, out on the street out in the moonlight  
And damn it this feels too right  
It's just like deja vu  
Me standin' here with you  
So I'll be holdin' my breath  
Could this be the end?  
Is it that moment when  
I find the one that I'll spend forever with?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You can't give up  
When you're lookin' for a diamond in the rough  
Because you never know when it shows up  
Make sure you're holdin' on  
'Cause it could be the one, the one you're waiting on  
  
'Cause nobody wants to be the last one there.  
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares.  
Someone to love with my life in their hands.  
There's gotta be somebody for me.  
  
Oh, nobody wants to go it on their own  
And everyone wants to know they're not alone.  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere.  
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.  
  
Nobody wants to be the last one there  
And everyone wants to feel like someone cares.  
Somebody else that feels the same somewhere.  
There's gotta be somebody for me out there.

My hopes just fell, and I can't see  
The reason why, why there is blood on my sleeve  
And all this time, I thought it mine  
But it's not, it's yours and  
  
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow  
  
And I don't see too well, don't sing too well  
And I settle to scream  
Just grab your shit, and leave with it  
They won't make no statues of you  
  
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow  
This label "thief", find a better title suited for you  
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you  
  
This time I've forgotten  
I swear this shit was rotten  
This time, I believe it  
'Cause I've seen the shit you're needin'  
  
It's not worth it for me, gets harder every time call you  
This life you lead, like swimming in a shiny ballroom  
Next time you bleed, right about this time tomorrow  
Next time you steal, better ask before you borrow  
This label "thief", find a better title suited for you  
This tidal wave, is coming down upon you

And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
I'll hold on, hold on  
  
I keep listening to my chest for a beat, but there's nothing left  
It's been a week since I've seen you, and I still can't believe it  
'Cause I'm dying inside alone  
  
And in every dream we gotta be apart  
I'm like a baby with a broken heart  
But the second that I see you  
You will know how much I need you  
Because I'll never be letting you go  
  
(Now you know why)  
I'm lost without you  
And there's nothing I can do  
Your the one that I can't go without  
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever  
  
I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
Because every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven  
  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
I'll hold on, hold on  
  
In a symphony, baby you would be my melody  
And you would flow like a river, slowing going on forever  
Like a feather that's blowing away  
Like everyone that needs a fairytale, like every mother's love that never
fails  
Like every game that needs a player, and a sinner needs a savior  
I'm the villain that your willing to save  
  
(Now you know why)  
I'm lost without you  
And there's nothing I can do  
Your the one that I can't go without  
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever  
  
I've for you now and I'm not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
Because every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven  
  
I'm willing to wait, just to see you another day  
What I'm waiting for will wash this pain away  
And it's never too late  
  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
And if forever never comes tonight  
I'll hold on, hold on  
  
(Now you know why)  
I'm lost without you  
And there's nothing I can do  
Your the one that I can't go without  
And by holding onto you, then I'll be holding on forever  
  
I've got you now and I'm not letting go of you  
Never been together long enough  
'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven  
'Cause every moment I'm with you, it's like I'm holding onto heaven

Never made it as a wise man  
I couldn't cut it as  
A poor man stealing  
Tired of living like a blind man  
I'm sick of sight without  
A sense of feeling  
And this is how you remind me  
  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you  
A heart worth breaking  
And I've been wrong  
I've been down  
Into the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream  
Are we having fun yet?  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no  
  
It's not like you didn't know that  
I said I love you and  
I swear I still do  
And it must have been so bad  
Cause living with him must have  
Damn near killed you  
  
And this is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you  
A heart worth breaking  
And I've been wrong  
I've been down  
Into the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream  
Are we having fun yet?  
  
Yeah, yeah, yet, no no  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, no no  
  
Never made it as a wise man  
I couldn't cut it as  
A poor man stealing  
And this is how you remind me  
This is how you remind me  
  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
This is how you remind me  
Of what I really am  
  
It's not like you to say sorry  
I was waiting on a different story  
This time I'm mistaken  
For handing you  
A heart worth breaking  
And I've been wrong  
I've been down  
Into the bottom of every bottle  
These five words in my head  
Scream  
Are we having fun yet?  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Are we having fun yet?  
Yeah, yeah  
Are we having fun yet?  
Yeah, yeah  
Are we having fun yet?  
Yeah, yeah, no, no

Just one more moment, that's all that's needed,  
Like wounded soldiers in need of healing  
Time to be honest, this time I'm pleading,  
Please don't dwell on it, 'cause I didn't mean it  
  
I can't believe I said I'd lay our love on the ground,  
But it doesn't matter 'cause I made it up, forgive me now  
Everyday I spend away, my soul's inside out,  
Gotta be some way that I can make it up to you now, somehow  
  
[Chorus]  
By now you know that I'd come for you  
No one but you, yes, I'd come for you  
But only if you told me to  
And I'd fight for you  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
I was blindfolded, but now I'm seeing,  
My mind was closing, now I'm believing  
I finally know just what it means to let someone in,  
To see the side of me that no one does, or ever will  
So if you're ever lost and find yourself all alone,  
I'd search forever just to bring you home,  
Here and now, this I vow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
Yes I'd come for you, no one but you,  
Yes I'd come for you, but only if you told me to  
  
And I'd fight for you,  
I'd lie, it's true  
Give my life for you,  
You know I'd always come for you  
  
No matter what gets in my way,  
As long as there's still life in me  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
I'd crawl across this world for you,  
Do anything you want me to  
No matter what, remember, you know I'd always come for you  
You know I'd always come for you.

It's hard to breathe, from underneath  
Smothering in all your heat  
It's hard to take, It's tough to break  
So I don't make the same mistakes  
  
The same mistake, (4x)  
  
Out in the yard is where I play,  
Don't come in cause I'm afraid  
You saw my face, I faced my friends  
Do I tell or just pretend?  
I found a friend, a friend who knows  
Who says he'll help but then he goes  
  
And then he goes (4x)  
  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
  
Fingernails, filled with dirt  
If you don't tell, you don't get hurt  
I cry for help, I pray to God  
Another tear he tries to rob  
To rob me of, my dignity  
Cause sanctuary's far from me  
  
Far from me (4x)  
  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah  
It's hard to take, a piece of me, so peacefully, yeah, yeah  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
  
So broke inside, don't run away  
And find another place to stay  
And make our inhibition go away  
Because I'm so afraid, yeah, yeah  
  
It's hard to breathe, from underneath  
Smothering in all your heat  
It's hard to take, It's tough to break  
So I don't make the same mistakes  
  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah  
I'm in the way, the way it goes, so go away, yeah, yeah  
It's hard to take, a piece of me, so peacefully, yeah, yeah  
In front of me, In front of me, so far from me, yeah, yeah

Tell your friends not to think aloud  
Until they swallow  
Whisper things into my brain  
Your voice sounds so hollow  
  
I am not a leader of men  
Since I prefer to follow  
Do you think I could have a drink  
Since it's so hard to swallow  
So hard to swallow  
  
So turn the television off  
And I will sing a song  
And if you suddenly have the urge  
You can sing along  
  
I touch your hand, I touch your face  
I think the fruit is rotten  
Give me lessons on how to breath  
'Cause I think I've forgotten  
I think I've forgotten  
  
One day, up to a cliff  
That overlooked the water  
I jumped in to save a girl  
It was somebody's daughter  
And now the ring is on my hand  
It was given to me by her  
To this day we all sit around  
And dream of ways to get higher  
To get much higher

Hey there little darling, where'd the old man go?  
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long?  
We can lie out in the field til the morning light  
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight  
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch  
And then the old man come a-runnin' with a hickory switch.  
  
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day.  
Why, I, have gotta learn the hard way.  
Buddy showed me just how fast a car can go.  
I'll race you for your pink slip right before this show.  
Throw your girlfriend in the bet to make things good.  
Cause she's been staring at me like no girlfriend should.  
  
Bastards sitting right there on the starting line  
Stuck the sugar in your gas tank by myself last night  
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day.  
Why, I, have gotta learn the hard way.  
  
Hey there little darling, where'd the old man go?  
Why don't we get out of town and do it all night long?  
We can lie out in the field til the morning light  
Then me and your old man are gonna have to fight  
Start the loving in the truck and wind up in the ditch  
And then the old man come a-runnin' with a hickory switch  
  
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day.  
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way.  
Oh, no, gotta learn this some day.  
Why, I, gotta learn the hard way.

I saw the river, just pulled him down  
I knew the man who hunted him down  
We watched the river, take him away  
Before he died, I could have sworn he said  
I am the only one  
I am the only one left  
  
Tired and afraid lies a saddened man  
Knelt beside him with head in hand  
And escaped life here with a lonely breath  
But before he died I could have sworn he said  
  
I am the only one  
I am the only one left  
Who ever gave a damn about you  
I am sorry  
I am sorry  
I was wrong  
I was wrong  
I've been wrong for way too long  
I am sorry that you're gone

Manhunt to find your daughter  
Buried underneath the water  
Now they consult a psychic  
Find how much I like it  
And now I've found a little friend  
It's too fast  
This won't last  
And to touch  
Hurts too much  
And now I've found a little friend  
  
And now it's just you and me  
Borrow one and we will make three  
I say we steal one more  
Just like we did once before  
  
And now I thought I told her  
That she won't get much older  
And now I've found a little friend  
  
And now it makes no difference  
'Cause I am not quite in yet  
And now its on the table  
'Cause she's perfectly able  
And now I've found a little friend

I'm in a bar full of bikers  
And a handful of junkies  
It's a fifty fifty chance that they're  
Plannin' to jump me  
Anybody drinking here is lucky just to leave here alive oh  
  
Well my favorite little waitress has  
Ahold of my eyes  
But here's a shotgun  
Loaded hidden under the bar  
Her finger's on the trigger  
If anybody gets out of line  
  
There's other places that are better to go  
But I'm addicted to the red light show  
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole  
And I can't get enough of the things that she does  
  
She's gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
I'm ready to go  
She's gonna like my pistol clean  
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go  
And I can't get enough of  
The things that she does, alright  
  
Well, she walks like a model  
And she talks like a trucker  
Doesn't want a lollipop  
But she sure loves a sucker  
They' re closin' in around her  
I'm cutting to the front of the line  
Oh, she grabbed a bottle of tequila  
And a lime for her lips  
Laid her body on the bar  
And put the salt on her hips  
Was lying when I told her  
That I'm the only gonna lick her tonight  
  
There's other places that are better to go  
But I'm addicted to the red light show  
Feel like a king and she's my ace in the hole  
And I can't get enough of the things that she does  
  
She's gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
I'm ready to go  
She's gonna lick my pistol clean  
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go  
  
She's gonna be my sex machine  
And I can never get her under control  
She's gonna climb all over me  
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo  
And I can't get enough of  
The things that she does, alright  
  
And I can't get enough of the things that she does  
She's gonna be my midnight queen  
Locked and loaded  
I'm ready to go  
She's gonna like my pistol clean  
She's got ahold of me and ain't lettin' go  
  
She's gonna be my sex machine  
And I can never get her under control  
She's gonna climb all over me  
I'm like a pony in my own rodeo  
  
And I can't get enough of  
The things that she does, alright

I miss you  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do  
  
I just woke up from a dream today  
Time gone by but you still look the same  
Felt so real to have you back with me  
It's just too bad it's just another dream  
Give me just one wish...  
  
If I could give it all away  
I'd do it just for one more day  
I thought I had the time to wait  
Now it's too late to tell you  
That I  
  
I miss you  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do  
(I miss you, so, so, I do)  
I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I miss you so much  
I miss you so much  
  
After dark, laughin' in the rain  
Silver heart locket on a chain  
Well pictures fade and silver turns to grey  
But the best of thieves couldn't take my love away  
Give me just one wish...  
  
If I could give it all away  
I'd do it just for one more day  
Trade it in for one more moment  
Tell you what I never told ya  
All the things I left unsaid  
I meant to say before you left  
I thought I had the time to wait  
Now it's too late to tell you  
  
I miss you  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do  
So, so, I do  
(I miss you, so, so, I do)  
I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I miss you so much  
I miss you so much  
  
If there was some way, you know I would  
I'd do it today, I wish I could  
I call out your name, it does no good  
I wish I knew what would  
  
I... I miss you so much  
God knows I do  
I wish my wish was enough  
Give me just one wish...

Cherry stem with her mouth she could tie in a knot  
Favorite trick she does, one in ten that she's got  
Making friends, setting trends, hardly having to try  
All the looks, by the book, best that money can buy  
  
Look what your money bought  
It's all that she's got  
It keeps her company  
Straight from Mom and Daddy  
  
Last chance to dance, out in back of the bar  
Shakin' hands, nice to meet you, I don't know who you are  
She has a toke and makes a joke about the alley man  
Never pleasured from the treasure in a garbage can  
  
Look what your money bought  
It's all that she's got  
It keeps her company  
Straight from Mom and Daddy  
  
Cherry stem with her mouth she could tie in a knot  
Favorite trick she does, one in ten that she's got  
Making friends, setting trends, hardly having to try  
All the looks, by the book, best that money can buy  
  
Look what your money bought  
It's all that she's got  
It keeps her company  
Straight from Mom and Daddy  
  
Look what your money bought  
It's all that she's got  
It keeps her company  
Straight from Mom and Daddy

Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not spending all of it with you.  
Now I'm, wondering why, I've kept this bottled inside,  
So I'm starting to regret not telling all of it to you.  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
You're never gonna be alone!  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone.  
  
And now, as long as I can, I'm holding on with both hands,  
Cause forever I believe that there's nothing I could need but you,  
So if I haven't yet, I've gotta let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
You're never gonna be alone!  
From this moment on, if you ever feel like letting go,  
I won't let you fall,  
When all hope is gone  
I know that you can carry on  
We're gonna take the world on  
I'll hold you 'till the hurt is gone  
  
Oh,  
You've gotta live every single day,  
Like it's the only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Don't let it slip away,  
Could be our only one, you know it's only just begun  
Every single day,  
May be our only one, what if tomorrow never comes?  
Tomorrow never comes  
  
Time, is going by, so much faster than I,  
And I'm starting to regret not telling all of this to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm gonna be there all the way,  
I won't be missing one more day,  
I'm gonna be there always,  
I won't be missing one more day.

I judge by what she's wearing  
Just how many heads I'm tearing  
Off of assholes keep coming on to her  
Each night seems like it's getting worse  
And I wish she'd take the night off  
So I don't have to fight off  
Every asshole coming on to her  
It happens every night she works  
They'll go and ask the DJ  
Find out just what would she say  
If they all tried coming on to her  
Don't they know it's never going to work?  
They think they'll get it inside her  
With every drink they buy her  
As they all try coming on to her  
This time somebody's getting hurt  
  
[Chorus]  
Here comes the next contestant  
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?  
Is that your hand?  
I wish you'd do it again  
I'll watch you leave here limping  
I wish you'd do it again  
I'll watch you leave here limping  
There goes the next contestant  
  
I even fear the ladies  
They're cool but twice as crazy  
Just as bad for coming on to her  
Don't they know it's never gonna work?  
Each time she bats an eyelash  
Somebody's grabbing her ass  
Everyone is coming on to her  
This time somebody's getting hurt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm hating what she's wearing  
Everybody here keeps staring  
Can't wait till they get what they deserve  
This time somebody's getting hurt  
  
Here comes the next contestant  
Is that your hand on my girlfriend?  
Is that your hand?  
I wish you'd do it again  
I'll watch you leave here limping  
I wish you'd do it again  
I'll watch you leave here limping  
I wish you'd do it again  
Each night seems like it's getting worse  
I wish you'd do it again  
This time somebody's getting hurt  
  
There goes the next contestant

I wanna do it 'till the sun comes up  
Until we're both so good and sweaty  
That we can't stand up  
I wanna do it 'till we're both about to drop  
As long as we're tied up together  
Then we're never gonna stop  
  
I wanna go until the neighbors all complain  
Because they heard somebody screamin'  
And they think we're both in pain  
I wanna go so long your parents think you've died  
There gonna call the cops, the CIA, and then the FBI  
  
[Chorus]  
Yeah,  
We're gonna love it when the lights go down  
Hold on here we go  
Yeah,  
We're gonna go until our legs give out  
Round and round we go  
Yeah,  
We're gonna do it hanging upside down  
Up and down we go  
Yeah,  
We're getting ready for the next go round  
Round and round we go  
  
So shut the windows, lock the doors, unplug the phone  
For all intents and purposes there ain't nobody home  
Then we can do it 'till the batteries are done  
And borrow two from the TV remote  
To turn this thing back on  
  
I wanna cover you with jello in the tub  
We can roll around for hours without ever comin' up  
I want you naked with your favorite heels on  
Slap John Deere across my ass  
And ride me up and down the lawn  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Come lie next to me Jesus Christ  
Holes in hand where a cross used to fit just right  
The meeting called, the topic: a ladies fate  
You don't have to remind me  
I won't be late  
  
Please excuse me, I'm sorry I just can't wait  
And don't use grandfather as the bait  
  
Down the hall the baby boy just born  
Rosary around a crown of thorns  
  
Please excuse me, I'm sorry I just can't wait  
And don't use grandfather as the bait  
  
Can't you see the lady's not ready  
Hands and fee are bound and unsteady  
In the hall the family's grieving  
I'm the one who stays  
I'm not leavin' yet

She's old enough  
She knows enough  
She's thrown up  
So throw her  
Out to me  
And I'll treat her like she was mine  
My belief  
You got your way and I'll get mine  
  
And I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While we're in this discussion  
  
Should have known enough  
Never grown enough  
Alone enough  
To know my  
  
Where would be  
The path I wanted to try  
If it fairs to be  
Good for me than I'd rather die  
  
And I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While we're in this discussion  
  
Black words always lead to something  
Bury her cause her time was cut thin  
All the while you just stood and stared  
Never cared to help we just got carried away  
  
Lately it seems like my dreams have started to die  
It occurred to me on the inside I guess so have I  
  
And I can't eat  
I can't sleep  
I want to thank you for coming  
And why do we always laugh  
While we're in the last ones coming  
  
Standing here with my two feet  
Enjoy it now cause it won't be  
Some way  
Some how  
The things that keep me alive  
Aren't livin' here anymore

Look at this photograph  
Every time I do it makes me laugh  
How did our eyes get so red?  
And what the hell is on Joey's head?  
  
This is where I grew up  
I think the present owner fixed it up  
I never knew we ever went without  
The second floor is hard for sneakin' out  
  
And this is where I went to school  
Most of the time I had better things to do  
Criminal record says I broke in twice  
I must of done it half a dozen times  
  
I wonder if it's too late  
Should I go back and try to graduate?  
Lot's better now than it was back then  
If I was them, I wouldn't let me in  
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I  
  
[Chorus]  
Every memory of lookin' out the back door  
I have the photo album spread out on my bedroom floor  
It's hard to say it  
Time to say it  
Good bye, good bye  
Every memory of walkin' out the front door  
I found the photo of the friend that I was lookin' for  
It's hard to say it  
Time to say it  
Good bye, good bye, good bye  
  
Remember the old arcade?  
Blew every dollar that we ever made  
The cops hated us hangin' out  
They said somebody went and burnt it down  
  
We use to listen to the radio  
And sing along with every song we know  
We said someday we'd find out how it feels  
To sing to more than just a steering wheel  
  
Kim's the first girl I kissed  
I was so nervous that I nearly missed  
She's had a couple of kids since then  
I haven't seen her since God knows when  
Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, God, I  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I miss that town  
I miss their faces  
You can't erase  
You can't replace it  
I miss it now  
I can't believe it  
So hard to stay  
Too hard to leave it  
  
If I could relive those days  
I know the one thing that would never change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look at this photograph  
Every time I do it makes me laugh  
Every time I do it makes me

And some say  
Why you follow something so long  
So I asked him  
And he convinced me before long  
Now its over  
And I've seen him, don't come back anymore  
And he said...  
I need  
I don't ask much anymore  
I found something  
  
Throw a stone into the water  
The ripple is broke  
Burn them, baby  
Just for holding the cradle too close  
Take it all back  
Search for justice, don't live there anymore  
And he said  
  
I need  
I don't ask much anymore  
I found something  
Yeah  
  
And why do you see me in this way?  
The way that I did  
I gave him the means to the end  
Yes I did  
I bothered not to believe in this way  
The way that I did  
I made him just to see in this way  
The way that I did  
  
I need  
I don't ask much anymore  
I found something

I know it's late but something's on my mind  
It couldn't wait, there's never any time  
'Cause life slips by without a warning  
And I'm tired of ignoring all the space that's between you and I  
Let's lock the door behind us,  
They won't find us  
Make the whole world wait  
While we  
  
Dance around this bedroom  
Like we've only got tonight  
Not about to let you go  
Until the morning light.  
You can be my whole world  
If I can be your satellite.  
  
Let's dance around this bedroom  
Like tonight's our only night  
Dance around this room,  
I'll be your satellite  
Dance around this room,  
I'll be your satellite.  
  
Do you recall how long it must have been  
Since any room held only you and me?  
And every song that sings about it  
Says that we can't live without it  
Now I know just what that really means.  
Let's lock the door behind us,  
They won't find us  
Make the whole world wait  
While we  
  
Dance around this bedroom  
Like we've only got tonight  
Not about to let you go  
Until the morning light.  
You can be my whole world  
If I can be your satellite.  
  
Let's dance around this bedroom  
Like tonight's our only night  
Dance around this room,  
I'll be your satellite  
Dance around this room,  
I'll be your satellite.  
  
Dance around the moon,  
You and I every night  
Dance around this room,  
I'll be your satellite  
  
I can't believe that days took into years  
I hate to see the moments disappear  
But tonight the sand is stopping  
Take the hourglass and drop it  
So we can stay  
Inside this atmosphere  
  
Dance around the moon,  
I'll be your satellite  
Dance around this room,  
I'll be your satellite  
  
Dance with me around the moon,  
I'll be your satellite  
Dance around this room,  
I'll be your satellite  
  
Let's dance around this bedroom,  
I'll be your satellite  
Let's dance around this bedroom,  
I'll be your satellite  
Let's dance around this bedroom,  
I'll be your satellite  
Let's dance around this bedroom,  
I'll be your satellite

It's getting late I haven't seen my date  
So tell me when the boys get here  
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock  
Want to get a belly full of beer  
  
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of Winos  
And my old lady she don't care  
My sister's looking cute in her braces and boots  
A handful of grease in her hair  
  
Don't give us none of your aggravation  
We had it with your discipline  
Saturday night's alright for fighting  
Get a little action in  
  
Get about as oiled as a diesel train  
Gonna set this town alight  
Saturday night's the night I like  
Saturday night's alright alright alright  
  
They're packed pretty tight in here tonight  
I'm looking for a woman to treat me right  
I could use a little muscle to get what I need  
I'll drink a fifth of jack and scream out "She's with me!"  
  
A couple of the sound that I really like  
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike  
I'm a juvenile product of the working class  
Whose best friend floats from the bottom of a glass

Prison gates won't open up for me  
On these hands and knees I'm crawlin'  
Oh, I reach for you, well I'm terrified of these four walls  
These iron bars can't hold my soul in  
All I need is you, come please, I'm callin'  
And, oh, I scream for you  
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Show me what it's like  
To be the last one standing  
And teach me wrong from right  
And I'll show you what I can be  
Say it for me, say it to me  
And I'll leave this life behind me  
Say it if it's worth saving me  
  
Heaven's gates won't open up for me  
With these broken wings I'm fallin' and all I see is you  
These city walls ain't got no love for me  
I'm on the ledge of the eighteenth story  
And, oh, I scream for you come please,  
I'm callin' and all I need from you, hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hurry, I'm fallin'  
And all I need is you  
Come please, I'm callin'  
And, oh, I scream for you  
Hurry, I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'  
  
Show me what it's like  
To be the last one standing  
And teach me wrong from right  
And I'll show you what I can be  
And say it for me, say it to me  
And I'll leave this life behind me  
Say it if it's worth saving me, hurry, I'm fallin'  
  
Say it for me, say it to me  
And I'll leave this life behind me  
Say it if it's worth saving me

Take away from me  
That what you just gave  
Nothing left to heal  
Nothing left to save  
Given half a chance  
Given what we've spent  
I will not repay  
I will not repent  
I don't want to leave  
I don't want to stay  
Get away from me  
Stay the hell away  
And I will give up my mind  
And I will give up my way  
And I will pluck out my eyes  
Yes I will feel my way  
I will  
  
Is there something wrong  
With the way I feel  
I don't want to beg  
I don't have to steal  
Let me prove myself  
Let me earn your trust  
Let me betray  
The way that we discussed  
I don't want to leave  
I don't want to stay  
Get away from me  
Stay the hell away  
  
And I will give up my mind  
And I will give my way  
And I will pluck out my eyes  
Yes I will feel my way  
I will  
  
In open hand, unopened gift  
Her broken bones, her head won't lift  
A decades been since you've been gone  
Mend the cracks and say so long  
Say so long

Crowds that scream at superstars  
Where bouncers show their battle scars  
I've been the first to sign on every wall  
Down the road and round the bend  
We pray to god it never ends  
I've been, I've seen, we've screamed to everyone  
  
We'll see you at the show  
If you don't come we'll never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while you're wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
We'll go out onto the town  
And light it up 'til we burn it down  
  
After hours and alcohol  
Every club, we've seen 'em all  
As long as we don't need to stand in line  
Party scenes and billboard dreams  
The ladies love those limousines  
You know were gonna show up every time  
  
Well see you at the show  
If you don't come we'll never know  
You stand off in the back  
You still stand out while your wearing black  
You jump onto the bus  
And ride around with all of us  
We'll go out on the town  
And light it up 'til we burn it down  
(burn it down)

Light it up till we burn it down

(Hey, hey) She had her eyes on the prize as the girl next door  
You grow up quick when ya grow up poor  
It's the only way to LA that she knows  
The Hollywood pose, teeth, tits, and toes  
Didn't take her long to leave the boulevard  
So many five star friends with black credit cards  
She'd try anything once, 'cause anything goes  
It never comes easy when you're digging for gold  
  
(Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed  
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
Far too pretty to be giving it cheap  
That's why she's making six figures working three days a week  
Ya she'd even break a promise in the promised land  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands  
  
(Hey, hey) I doubt she'd even let the devil buy her little black book  
City Hall would probably fall if anyone got a look  
Every A list player is a favorite friend  
Says they all taste the same in the back of the Benz  
Her congressman will call her every once in a while  
Got the school girl skirt on the top of the pile  
She's done everyone once, and everyone knows  
You got to get a little dirty when you're digging for gold  
  
(Hey, hey) Well she ain't no Cinderella when she's getting undressed  
'Cause she rocks it like the naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Someone spilled the beans and now her name's in the press  
Tough to keep it all a secret when you're one of the best  
The judge is going easy 'cause he paid for her chest  
Ya he loves his little naughty wicked witch of the west  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She'll shake her money maker twice as hard as anyone can  
She didn't make it this far by just shakin' hands.

She's got me nervous  
Talkin' a hundred miles an hour  
She's more than worth it  
I swear she smells just like a flower  
I'd fall to pieces if I went anywhere without her  
I love when she says "what's wrong with right here on the counter?"  
  
Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster  
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister  
Coca-Cola rollercoaster  
Love her even though I'm not supposed to.  
  
Funky little monkey, she's a twisted trickster  
Everybody wants to be the sister's mister  
Coca-Cola rollercoaster  
Love her even though I'm not supposed to.  
  
She keeps me up (I keep you up)  
She keeps me up (I keep you up)  
All night (All night)  
All night (All night)  
  
She keeps me up (I keep you up)  
She keeps me up (I keep you up)  
All night (All night)  
All night (All night)  
  
I need her so bad,  
Sometimes I feel like I can taste it  
This evil romance  
So good I never wanna waste it  
I can't trust my friends  
'Cause she's what everybody chases  
I know where she's been  
'Cause it's on everybody's faces  
  
I never wanna have to slow down  
Got to be a better way to come down  
I've gotta stay awake some how  
  
I never wanna have to slow down  
Got to be a better way to come down  
I've gotta stay awake some how

There's clothes all over the floor  
Don't remember them being here before  
Smell of perfume is in here, why's lipstick on the mirror  
And still I don't understand  
  
No pictures left in the hall  
There's three new holes in my wall  
Where the hell's my credit cards, why's my wallet in the yard  
And still I don't understand  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Why's love gotta be so tough  
  
Should see the look on my face  
My shit's all over the place  
Why's this happening to me, why'd you take both sets of keys  
And still I don't understand  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Why's love gotta be so tough  
  
Oh, and now I guess I should've listened  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh, ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
  
There's clothes all over my floor  
I don't remember them being there before  
There are no candles in here, lipstick's still on my mirror  
And still I don't understand  
  
Oh, and now I guess I should've listened  
When you said you'd had enough  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Why must love be so tough  
  
Well, now I guess I should've listened  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
When you said you'd had enough  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
A little trick I picked up from my father, in one ear and out the other  
Ahh-oh, ahh-ahh  
Why's love gotta be so tough

[Verse 1:]  
Yeah the lady and me both agree some days we just don't get along  
But the whiskey and me both agree maybe we both just better off  
Well the preacher believes that I'll meet all of these demons hanging on  
But we both know if they don't, I'll get lonely, need a few to tag along  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Hanging here by a thread  
Hear a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said "In case you hadn't noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)  
And I'm not about to anymore"  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Now the wagon I'm in's paper thin  
I think one wheel's coming off  
Hey sister sin with that grin, where you been?  
So kind of you to help me out  
  
[Pre-Chorus:]  
Hanging here by a thread  
Hear a voice inside my head  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said "In case you hadn't noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)  
And I'm not about to anymore"  
  
[Bridge x2:]  
Fall from grace, kingdom come  
Lying face down in the mud  
Please don't hate, look don't judge  
For I know not just what I've done  
  
[Refrain:]  
Lying face down in the mud  
For I know not just what I've done  
For I know not just what I've done  
  
[Chorus x2]  
Lie me beside you every night  
And dread the day you might be gone  
She said "In case you hadn't noticed that  
Played second fiddle to the bottle for a little too long (no)  
And I'm not about to anymore"

I reside in 209, you're in 208  
You moved in last Friday night  
And I just couldn't wait  
So I tried to call across the hall to ask you out someday  
But a lineup formed outside your door  
And I was way too late  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow  
This whole thing's like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place  
  
[Chorus:]  
Because somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else  
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with  
I want to be that someone that you're with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that you're with  
I've got to be that someone that you're with  
And I'm pacing by the phone  
'Cause I hate to be alone  
And if you're out there with him somewhere and just about to kiss  
God, I want to be that someone that you're with  
  
Well, I hear your favorite songs you sing along with everyday  
And I borrow things that I don't need for conversation sake  
Last night I heard your key, it hit your lock at four AM  
Instead of being out with me, you must be out with them  
  
Well, I'd rather start off slow  
This whole thing's like some sort of race  
Instead of winning what I want, I'm sitting here in second place  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, somewhere the one I want to be with's with somebody else  
Oh god, I want to be that someone that you're with  
And I can talk about it all day long till I run out of breath  
But I still want to be that someone that you're with  
I've got to be that someone that you're with  
And I'm pacing by the phone  
'Cause I hate to be alone  
And if you're out there with him somewhere, and just about to kiss  
God, I've got to be that someone that...  
I want to be that someone that...  
I've got to be that someone that you're with

Got to meet the hottie with the million dollar body  
They say it's over budget but you'd pay her just to touch it, come on  
Needs to hit the big screen and shoot a little love scene  
If Hollywood had called her she'd be gone before your holler, come on  
  
Pretty little lady with the pretty pink thong  
Every sugar daddy hitting on her all night long  
Doesn't care about the money she could be with anybody  
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along  
  
[Chorus]  
(You naughty thing)  
Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake your ass around for everyone  
(Your such a mover)  
I love the way you dance with anybody  
(The way you swing)  
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  
Your so much cooler when you never pull it out  
Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth  
  
Crafty little lip tricks  
Tattoos on her left hip  
She bending as your spending  
There's no ending it so baby come on  
Dressed up like a princess  
Bettin' that her skin smells better  
Than the scent of every flower in the desert come on  
  
Pretty little lady with the pretty pink thong  
Every sugar daddy hittin' on her all night long  
Doesn't care about the money she could be with anybody  
Ain't it funny how the honey wanted you all along  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She loves the night scene bar queen  
Was living for the fun taking over every dance floor like shes the only one  
In the spotlight all night dissin' everyone  
And trying to look so innocent while sucking on her thumb  
  
Your so much cooler  
When you never pull it out  
So much cuter  
With something in your mouth  
  
(You naughty thing)  
Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake your ass around for everyone  
I love the way you dance with anybody  
(The way you swing)  
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  
  
(You naughty thing)  
Your ripping up the dance floor honey  
(You naughty women)  
You shake that ass around for everyone  
(Your such a mover)  
I love the way you dance with anybody  
(The way you swing)  
And tease them all by sucking on your thumb  
  
Your so much cooler when you never pull it out  
Cause you look so much cuter with something in your mouth

Lookin' like another Bob Marley day  
Hittin' from the bong like a diesel train  
And I'm down with hanging out this afternoon  
  
We got weeds in the backyard four feet tall  
Cheech and Chong probably would of smoked 'em all  
So I'm out on the couch this afternoon  
  
Beer bottles layin' on the kitchen floor  
If we take 'em all back we can buy some more  
So I doubt we'll go without this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just sitting around, hangin' out this afternoon  
  
Landlord says I should buy a tent  
But he can kiss my ass 'cause I paid the rent  
So I doubt he'll kick me out this afternoon  
  
Down on the corner in a seedy bar  
Jukebox crankin' out the CCR  
Had a few, to Suzy Q this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Yeah, just sitting around hanging out this afternoon  
  
Don't wanna wristwatch or an alarm clock  
To see what time it is  
From the moment I wake up  
I just love being with my friends  
We barely get by but have the best times  
And hope it never ends  
We drink all day until we fall down  
So we can do it all again  
  
It's not the human walk  
It's the human race  
If you ain't livin' on edge  
You're takin' too much space  
So I doubt I'll figure out  
Just what to do  
'Bout to kick it around  
Hanging out this afternoon  
  
You better hang on if your taggin' along  
'Cause we'll be doin' this 'till six in the mornin'  
Nothin' wrong with goin' all night long  
Just not tough to put the brakes on,  
Doesn't matter when you'd rather  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Yeah we get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
Just sitting around  
Get up, and go out  
Me and all my friends  
We drink up, we fall down  
And then we do it all again  
  
Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon  
Sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just kicking around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon  
Just sitting around, hanging out this afternoon

To line up to the ring  
For a battle that you can't win  
Swing as hard as you can swing  
It will still mean nothing  
Should've seen it coming  
It had to happen sometime  
But you went and brought a knife  
To an all out gunfight  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
You've gone too far, who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for, well this means war  
  
Say anything you want  
But talk will get you nowhere  
The only thing you brought is psychological warfare  
Well there's no getting off  
And now you got to wonder  
Who will dig you out when you're six feet under  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
You've gone too far, who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for, well this means war  
  
And the only thing to save  
Is the banner that you wave  
To be wrapped around your grave  
  
You've gone too far, who do you think you are  
Is this what you came for, well this means war  
This means war

You call to me, and I fall at your feet  
How could anyone ask for more?  
And our time apart, like knives in my heart  
How could anyone ask for more?  
  
[Chorus]  
But if there's a pill to help me forget,  
God knows I haven't found it yet  
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to  
  
'Cause trying not to love you, only goes so far  
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart  
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor  
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for  
'Cause trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
Only makes me love you more  
  
And this kind of pain, only time takes away  
That's why it's harder to let you go  
And nothing I can do, without thinking of you  
That's why it's harder to let you go  
But if there's a pill to help me forget,  
God knows I haven't found it yet  
But I'm dying to, God I'm trying to  
  
It's trying not to love you, only goes so far  
Trying not to need you, is tearing me apart  
Can't see the silver lining, from down here on the floor  
And I just keep on trying, but I don't know what for  
'Cause trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
  
So I sit here divided, just talking to myself  
Was it something that I did?  
Was there somebody else?  
When a voice from behind me, that was fighting back tears  
Sat right down beside me, and whispered right in my ear  
Tonight I'm dying to tell you  
  
That trying not to love you, only went so far  
Trying not to need you, was tearing me apart  
Now I see the silver lining, of what we're fighting for  
And if we just keep on trying, we could be much more  
'Cause trying not to love you  
Oh, yeah, trying not to love you  
Only makes me love you more  
Only makes me love you more

Buddy you're a boy make a big noise  
Playin' in the street gonna be a big man some day  
You got mud on yo' face  
You big disgrace  
Kickin' your can all over the place  
Singin'  
  
We will we will rock you  
We will we will rock you  
  
Buddy you're a young man hard man  
Shoutin' in the street gonna take on the world some day  
You got blood on yo' face  
You big disgrace  
Wavin' your banner all over the place  
Singin'  
  
We will we will rock you  
We will we will rock you  
  
Buddy you're an old man poor man  
Pleadin' with your eyes gonna make you some peace some day  
You got mud on your face  
You big disgrace  
Somebody better put you back into your place  
Singin'  
  
We will we will rock you  
We will we will rock you

What are you waiting for?  
What are you waiting for?  
Are you waiting on a lightening strike  
Are you waiting for the perfect night  
Are you waiting till the time is right?  
What are you waiting for  
Don't you wanna learn to deal with fear  
Don't you wanna take the wheel and steer  
Don't you wait another minute here  
What are you waiting for?  
  
You gotta go and reach for the top  
Believe in every dream that you got  
You only living one so tell me?  
What are you, what are you waiting for?  
You know you gotta give it your all  
And don't you be afraid if you fall  
You only living one so tell me?  
What are you, what are you waiting for?  
  
Are you waiting for the right excuse?  
Are you waiting for a sign to choose  
While your waiting it's the time you lose  
What are you waiting for?  
Don't you wanna spread your wings and fly?  
Don't you wanna really live your life?  
Don't you wanna love before you die?  
What are you waiting for?  
  
You gotta go and reach for the top  
Believe in every dream that you got  
You only living one so tell me?  
What are you, what are you waiting for?  
You know you gotta give it your all  
And don't you be afraid if you fall  
You only living one so tell me?  
What are you, what are you waiting for?  
  
Tell me what your waiting for  
Show me what your aiming for  
What you gonna save it for?  
So what you really waiting for?  
  
Tell me what your waiting for  
Show me what your aiming for  
What you gonna save it for?  
So what you really waiting for?  
Everybody's gonna make mistakes  
But everybody's got a choice to make  
Everybody needs a leap of faith  
When are you taking yours?  
  
You gotta go and reach for the top  
Believe in every dream that you got  
You only living one so tell me?

One more depending on a prayer  
And we all look away  
People pretending everywhere  
It's just another day  
There's bullets flying through the air  
And they still carry on  
We watch it happen over there  
And then just turn it off  
  
[Chorus]  
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
We must stand together  
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
There's no giving in  
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Hand in hand forever  
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
That's when we all win  
(Hey, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
That's, that's, that's when we all win  
That's, that's, that's when we all win  
  
They tell us every thing's alright  
And we just go along  
How can we fall asleep at night?  
When somethings clearly wrong  
When we could feed a starving world  
With what we throw away  
But all we serve are empty words  
That always taste the same  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The right thing to guide us  
Is right here, inside us  
No one can divide us  
When the light is leading on  
But just like a heartbeat  
The drumbeat carries on  
  
And the drumbeat carries on  
(Just like a heartbeat)  
  
[Chorus]

I was wrong to think that I could ever trust in you  
I was wrong to think that you might want to trust me, too  
  
Here I am, here I am  
Here I stand  
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I stand  
  
I was wrong to think that I could ever love in you  
I was wrong to think that you might want to love me, too  
  
Here I am, here I am  
Here I stand  
Here I am, here I am, here I am, here I stand  
  
So where the hell are you?  
So where the hell are you?  
So where are you when I need someone, too?  
I'm tired of needing you

Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines  
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine  
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due  
Walking down the aisle, still straining you  
  
Still hear you screaming where do I hide?  
All he asks, I said hurry inside  
  
He said, she said, no she don't  
Be back before morning, you know she won't  
I remember that summer, like yesterday  
And I remember his mother, as he was dragged away  
  
I still hear him screaming  
Where do I hide?  
All he asks, I say hurry inside  
A whole lot of memory  
Yours and not mine  
All he asks, I said hurry inside  
  
Got a criminal record, I can't cross state lines  
First on the bad list, and you're last on mine  
Lookin' for a scapegoat, long past due  
Walking down the aisle, still straining you  
  
Still hear you screaming  
Where do I hide?  
All he asks, I say hurry inside  
A whole lot of memory  
Yours and not mine  
All he asks, I said hurry inside  
Where do I hide?

Forever's a lonely time and the dogs aren't always  
Aren't always on my mind  
'Cause I didn't free them  
The scenery is burning me 'cause I'm still in it  
So why don't you free me  
'Cause its not my business  
What he's done to me  
Control is all you really need  
And I can't believe it  
I can't believe that  
You didn't see me  
  
Passing glances fall on me  
Like screams on deaf ears  
They're all laughing at me  
With encouraging cheers  
What he's done to me  
Control is all you really need  
And I can't believe it  
I can't believe that  
You wouldn't free me  
  
Why don't you see me?  
Why don't you free me?  
I can't believe that  
You don't believe me  
  
I guess I had it comin'  
My fault for not runnin'  
I just dressed too tempting  
'Cause your heads fuckin empty  
And I can't believe it  
I can't believe that you didn't see me

I paid my last respects this mornin' on an early grave  
Already said goodbye, nothin' left to say  
A tiny church a tiny town and not a tear was spent  
Not how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this  
  
Well I'm hating, all of this  
I'm hating, all of this  
All of this, all of this  
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days  
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along, and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning  
  
I've been a loser all my life, I'm not about to change  
If you don't like, there's the door, nobody made you stay  
There ain't a woman on the planet who can deal with it  
Just how I wanted it, I'm hating all of this  
  
Well I'm hating, all of this  
I'm hating, all of this  
All of this, all of this  
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days  
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along, and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning  
  
All of this, all of this  
Now I know why, I hide my love from you some days  
No I don't mind keeping this bottled inside me  
You came along, and tore this world out around me  
Looks like you found me  
Now I know why  
I felt like shit when I woke up this morning

Feeling fine.  
Let's rip out yours instead of mine.  
And all you need  
Are several ways to watch me bleed.  
  
Well, thanks for stopping this beating in my chest.  
It's easier now, and I'm happy like this.  
Just like this.  
  
Even though I ain't coming back now,  
I didn't mean to seem as though  
I was so ungrateful for for all you've done here.  
For yanking out my  
  
Honestly.  
You, you've friends for all your needs.  
And stay the course.  
No, the universe ain't yours.  
  
Well, thanks for stopping this beating in my chest.  
It's easier now, and I'm happy like this.  
Just like this.  
  
Even though I ain't coming back now,  
I didn't mean to seem as though  
I was so ungrateful for for all you've done here.  
Even though I ain't coming back now,  
I didn't mean to seem as though  
I was so ungrateful for for all you've done here.  
For yanking out my  
  
If I could only see this.  
If I could have one good reason.  
All my feelings out of season.  
Am I to thank for yanking out my  
Yanking out my  
  
Feeling fine.  
Let's rip out yours instead of mine.  
And all you need  
Are several ways to watch me bleed.
