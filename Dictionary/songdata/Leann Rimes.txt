Every night I say my prayers  
Like throwing confetti in the air  
I don't need perfect, but I'll take fair  
I've learned to drive while I cry  
Figured out the answer's always why  
I've been brave and I've been scared  
  
I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Do what I can to survive  
Back and forth from a woman to a child  
I'm coming up for air  
We're not all that far apart  
Both fragile works of art  
See the colors that we share  
  
But, I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Oh I've always believed in him and me  
I get you, I wish that you'd get me  
  
Yeah well, I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you did  
  
Oh, I'm just a girl like you  
I'm just a girl like you  
He may break my heart too  
But that's a chance I gotta take  
Just like you

Wild flowers felt good beneath my feet  
The wind blew tangles in my hair  
As long as i remember the blue eyed boy lived down the road  
Until then i never noticed he was there  
He was like a storm and keepin' me awake  
And no one's gonna stop me there from runnin' in the rain  
  
And it was three a.m. and the moon was bright  
And we'd sneak out and go for a ride  
And we'd made love where the river meets the sky  
Yeah he'd say things i've never heard  
And i'd hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasn't afraid to fall  
  
Autumn leaves were breakin' 'neath my feet  
The dawnin' face had felt a tear  
He said he didn't feel the way he did before  
But somehow we were still there  
But i didn't wanna lose him  
And i knew my heart would break  
And no one's gonna stop me there from chasin' the pain  
  
And it was three a.m. and the moon was bright  
And we'd sneak out and go for a ride  
And we'd made love where the river meets the sky  
Yeah he'd say things i've never heard  
And i'd hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasn't afraid to fall  
  
I wouldn't change a single thing  
Every touch a drop of rain  
Oohh ohh yeah oh oh yeah  
And it was three a.m. and the moon was bright  
And we'd sneak out and go for a ride  
And we'd made love where the river meets the sky  
And he'd say things i've never heard  
And i'd hang on his every word  
And the perfect teen i gave him my heart  
And i wasn't afraid to fall  
  
I wasn't afraid to fall oh ohh  
Wasn't afraid to fall ohh oh

Take back the holly and mistletoe  
Silver bells on a string  
If I wrote a letter to Santa Claus  
I would ask for just one thing  
  
I don't need sleigh rides in the snow  
I don't want a Christmas that's blue  
Take back the tinsel, stockings and bows  
'cause all I want for Christmas is you  
  
I don't need expensive things  
They don't matter to me  
What I want can't be found  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
You are the angel that tops my tree  
You are my dream come true  
Santa can't bring me what I need  
'cause all I want for Christmas is you  
  
I don't need expensive things  
They don't matter to me  
What I want can't be found  
Underneath the Christmas tree  
  
You are the angel that tops my tree  
You are my dream come true  
Santa can't bring me what I need  
'cause all I want for Christmas is you  
  
All I want for Christmas is you  
Yeah all I want for Christmas is you

Do you ever get past the pain you go through?  
When you give all you can and you can't understand  
Why a dream won't come true?  
  
It's one sided romance you can't undo  
When you do all the loving and hurting, too  
You can't take it back once you give your heart  
Trying not to recall how you did all is the hardest part  
  
And you can't change the reason you feel like a fool  
'Cause you did all the loving and hurting, too  
  
That's the price you pay for doing more than your share  
When you love enough for both of you, no one else has to care  
And though it's all over, you look back on the truth  
You did all the lovin' and the hurting, too  
  
And though it's all over, it's over for you  
You're still doing all the lovin' and the hurting, too  
You did all the lovin' and the hurting, too

Amazing grace how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me.  
I once was lost but now I'm found.  
Was blind but now I see.  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved.  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed.  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Then when we first begun.  
Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me.  
I once was lost, but now I'm found.  
Was blind, but now I see

I remember every touch  
Every flower  
Every word you ever said  
I remember how we looked at each other  
The very first time we met  
I'll never forget  
  
I remember every smile  
Every letter  
Every kiss you gave to me  
How we'd talk, and you'd hold me for hours  
Until I'd fall fast asleep  
You said you would always be there  
Should I need your arms around me  
But now that I've fallen to my knees  
I don't think you give a damn about me  
  
And it feels like  
We're running out of time  
And it feels like  
I'm the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby, will you tell me what's wrong?  
'Cause it feels like you're already gone  
  
Did you leave in the middle of the night  
And forget to say goodbye?  
Did you feel it was time to go  
But you didn't wanna see me cry?  
It gets harder and harder  
For me to believe  
That you still love me  
So get on with it, baby, if you're gonna leave  
It's not worth saving  
  
And it feels like  
We're running out of time  
And it feels like  
I'm the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby, will you tell me what's wrong?  
'Cause it feels like you're already gone  
  
My heart is telling me it's too late  
To beg you to stay  
You wouldn't hear me anyway  
Yeah!  
  
And it feels like  
We're running out of time  
And it feels like  
I'm the last thing on your mind  
Oh  
I can touch your skin  
I can hear you breathe  
Baby, will you tell me what's wrong?  
'Cause it feels like you're already gone  
  
You're already gone  
  
Oh, yeah  
  
'Cause it feels like  
You're so gone

Blue  
Oh, so lonesome for you  
Why can't you be blue over me  
  
Blue  
Oh, so lonesome for you  
Tears fill my eyes till I can't see  
  
Three o'clock in the morning  
Here am I  
Sittin' here so lonely  
So lonesome I could cry  
  
Blue  
Oh, so lonesome for you  
Why can't you be blue over me  
  
Now that it's over  
I realized  
Those weak words you whispered were nothin' but lies  
  
Blue oh, so lonesome for you  
Why can't you be blue over me  
Why can't you be blue over me

I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
  
I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
  
Well it was on one moonlit night  
Stars sinin' bright  
Whispered all night  
Love said goodbye.  
  
I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
  
Take it guys!  
  
Well it was on one lonely night  
Stars shinin' bright  
Whispered all night  
Love said goodbye.  
  
I said blue moon of Kentucky  
Keep on shinin'  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.  
Shine on the one that's gone and left me blue.

Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream I dream is only brought me pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
It seems so hard to bear  
How I longed to always have you near  
You've grown tired and now you say we're through  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
  
Born to lose  
I've lived my life in vain  
Every dream I dream is only brought with pain  
All my life I've always been so blue  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you  
Born to lose  
And now I'm losing you

My heart is like a bottle with the world inside  
I couldn't fit more happy in it if I tried  
Look at all the love this thing can hold  
I keep the lid on tight so it won't explode  
I can't help notice from the day we met  
When you touch my hand this is how I get  
To keep my symptoms simplified  
Oh my heart is like a bottle with the world inside  
  
So tell me how do you fit every star in the sky  
Every perfect work of art that's ever made me cry  
Every rose, every sound, every ocean, every shore  
You've gone and found a way to fit all of that and more  
  
I said to the doctor, "Doctor, what?ll I do??  
To stretch this heart and make a little more room?"  
He said, "You're one in a million and I'm mystified  
See, your heart is like a Bottle with the world inside"  
  
So tell me how do you fit every star in the sky  
Every perfect work of art that's ever made me cry  
Every rose, every sound, every ocean, every shore  
You've gone and found a way to fit all of that and more  
  
Well my heart is like a bottle with the world inside  
I couldn't fit more happy in it if I tried  
You love me that must be why  
Oh, my heart is like a bottle with the world inside

Give me a moment here  
Just enough to catch my breath  
Something is happening here  
And it's scaring me to death  
You push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again  
For the first time in a long time I'm throwing caution to the wind  
  
You can break me down if you want to break me down  
Doesn't really matter how this crazy thing turns out  
Cause you take me there  
Where I lose myself  
Just for a moment if nothing else  
You can break me down if you want to break me down  
  
Yeah it's the strangest thing but it all makes perfect sense  
Funny how life falls in place when you dare to take a chance  
You push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again  
So take me where you want to I am willing to give in  
  
You can break me down if you want to break me down  
Doesn't really matter how this crazy thing turns out  
Cause you take me there  
Where I lose myself  
Just for a moment if nothing else  
You can break me down if you want to break me down  
  
You push me to the edge where I want to risk it all again  
So take me where you want to I am willing to give in

Today I watched a robin  
In our front yard  
I thought by now that they should all be gone.  
With winter 'round the corner  
Snow on its way  
Surely something must be wrong.  
Then in that old oak tree I finally saw her  
Where she sat gazing down upon her mate  
And the song that she was singing  
Seemed to say "I'll be right here"  
"I'd like to go, but your love's made me stay."  
  
He's got a broken wing  
And that's why he can't fly  
She just can't leave him there  
So she stays by his side  
They're just like you and me  
Oh you should've heard her sing  
They won't give up  
It's just a broken wing.  
  
I wish we all could learn  
What they seem to have found  
To love our families  
When trouble comes around  
I'll bet that God saw fit  
To show them unto me  
Him on the ground  
Her in that tree.  
  
He's got a broken wing  
And that's why he can't fly  
She just can't leave him there  
So she stays by his side  
They're just like you and me  
Oh you should've heard her sing  
They won't give up  
We won't give up  
They won't give up  
It's just a broken wing.  
  
Ooh  
It's just a broken wing.

I don't like to be alone in the night  
And I don't like to hear I'm wrong when I'm right  
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoe  
But I do love you, but I do love you  
I don't like to see the sky painted gray  
And I don't like when nothing's going my way  
And I don't like to be the one with the blues  
But I do love you, but I do love you  
Love everything about the way you're loving me  
The way you lay your head  
Upon my shoulder when you sleep  
And I love to kiss you in the rain  
I love everything you do, oh I do  
I don't like to turn the radio on  
Just to find I missed my favorite song  
And I don't like to be the last with the news  
But I do love you, but I do love you  
Love everything about the way you're loving me  
The way you lay your head  
Upon my shoulder when you sleep  
And I love to kiss you in the rain  
I love everything you do, oh I do  
And I don't like to be alone in the night  
And I don't like to hear I'm wrong when I'm right  
And I don't like to have the rain on my shoes  
But I do love you but I do love you  
But I do love you but I do love you

Under a lovers' sky  
Gonna be with you  
And no one's gonna be around  
If you think that you won't fall  
Well just wait until  
Til the sun goes down  
  
Underneath the starlight, starlight  
There's a magical feeling, so right  
It'll steal your heart tonight  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
You'll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
No, you can't fight it  
It's gonna get to your heart  
  
There's no escape from love  
Once a gentle breeze  
Weaves it's spell upon your heart  
No matter what you think  
It won't be too long  
Til your in my arms  
Underneath the starlight, starlight  
We'll be lost in the rhythm, so right  
Feel it steal your heart tonight  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
You'll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
No you can't fight it  
No matter what you do  
The night is gonna get to you  
  
Don't try then  
You're never gonna win  
  
Part of me the starlight, starlight  
There's a magical feeling, so right  
It will steal your heart tonight  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
You'll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
No, you can't fight it  
  
You can try to resist  
Try to hide from my kiss  
But you know  
Don't you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
Deep in the dark  
You'll surrender your heart  
But you know  
But you know that you can't fight the moonlight  
No, you can't fight it  
It's gonna get to your heart

Leann:  
(yodeling)  
The cattle are prowlin',  
The coyotes are howlin'  
Way out where the doggies roam  
Where spurs are a jinglin'  
And the cowboy is singing  
His lonesome cattle call  
(yodeling)  
  
He rides in the sun  
'til his days work is done  
And he rounds up the cattle each fall  
(yodeling)  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Eddy:  
For hours he would ride  
On the range far and wide  
When the night wind blows up and slow  
His heart is a feather  
In all kinds of weather  
He sings his cattle call  
(yodeling)  
  
He's browned as a fairy  
From ridin' the prairie  
And he sings with an western drawl  
Singing his cattle call  
  
Leann and eddy:  
(yodeling)

Sing me a song of praise and glory  
Help this wandering child to understand.  
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal  
I'll be clinging to a saving hand.  
I want you to sing to me about the rock of ages  
And sing about eternity so sweet.  
So that when I take my last breath of life  
I'll awaken at my savior's feet.  
I want you to tell me about Paul and Matthew  
And sing about my dear savior's birth  
And tell about his trials and tribulations.  
While he walked upon his heathen Earth.  
Come on and sing me a song of praise and glory  
Help this wandering child to understand.  
That when I close my eyes in sleep eternal  
I'll be clinging to a saving hand.  
I'll be clinging to a saving hand.

What I'm lookin' for  
Is a love that's forever  
Someone who can capture my soul in a heartbeat  
And stay for all time  
What I'm prayin' for  
Is a match made in heaven  
Someone who will worship my body  
And still put his heart on the line  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
What I'm searching for  
Is a man who'll stand by me  
Who will walk through the fire  
And be my flame in the night  
I won't settle for  
Less than what I deserve  
A friend and a lover who'll love me  
For the rest of my life  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
Yeah I've had promises broken  
Three words left unspoken  
They just left me achin' for more  
But I'll fight temptation  
I won't be impatient  
There's one thing that's worth waitin' for  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
Commitment  
Someone who'll go the distance  
I need somebody with staying power  
Who'll make me go weak in the knees  
  
Commitment  
And everything that goes with it  
I need honor and love in my life from somebody  
Who's playin' for keeps  
  
Way  
Commitment

I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
I want to learn to rope and to ride  
I want to ride o'er the plains and the deserts  
Out west of that great divide  
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'  
While the sun sinks in the West  
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
That's the life I love the best  
  
I want to ride Old Paint goin' at a run  
I want to feel the wind in my face  
A thousand miles from all the city lights  
Goin' a cowhand's pace  
I want to pillow my head near the sleeping herd  
While the moon shines down from above  
I want to strum my guitar and yodelay-hee-hoo  
Oh that's the life that I love  
  
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
I want to learn to rope and to ride  
I want to ride o'er the plains and the deserts  
Out west of that great divide  
I want to hear the coyotes howlin'  
While the sun sinks in the West  
I want to be a cowboy's sweetheart  
That's the life I love the best

Oh it's cryin' time again  
You're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
That it won't be before it's cryin' time  
  
Now they say that absence makes  
The heart grow fonder  
And that tears are only rain to make love grow  
Well my love for you can never grow more stronger  
If I live to be a hundred years old  
  
Oh it's cryin' time again  
You're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
That it won't be love before it's cryin' time  
  
Now you say you've foiund someone that you love better  
That the way it happens every time to old  
And as sure as the sun comes up tomorrow  
Cryin' time will start when you walk out the door  
  
Oh it's cryin' time again  
You're gonna leave me  
I can see that far away look in your eyes  
I can tell by the way you hold me darlin'  
That it won't be long before it's cryin' time  
  
Yeah, it won't be long before it's cryin' time

There you go again when you  
Rub up against my skin  
I have to catch my breath  
I began to sweat, oh  
Lips tracin' down my neck and  
it's scarin' me to death  
How'd you learn to draw me  
to the cliff  
Just to push me off  
Just to push me off the edge  
  
[Chorus]  
Damn, I hate the way you  
know me and  
Damn, you kill me when you  
hold me  
Like I'm your world, like this  
won't hurt  
Like a favorite curse hittin'  
every nerve  
Damn, I'm fightin' and I'm losin'  
and  
Damn you, you're pullin' and  
I'm pushin'  
I'm wrestlin' with,  
I toss and twist  
Till finally I give in, Damn  
  
I hate bein' addicted only  
You would have predicted that  
I'd be torn and worn so thin  
You can see right through  
You can see right through my  
soul  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get reckless, scared, confused  
I feel desperate so for you  
And you know it, you know it  
You know it, yes you do  
  
[Chorus]

You may have a tabloid life  
Pay for all your friend  
You may be a suburban wife  
With your white picket fence  
You may be a suit and tie  
Paying off your high rise rent  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down baby  
When it all comes down to it  
  
[Chorus:]  
Doesn't everybody want the same thing  
To be loved  
Doesn't everybody want the same thing  
Why isn't that enough  
Doesn't everybody want the same thing  
  
You may be a night shift waitress  
To send your kid through school  
You may be a stubborn doctor  
Pushing for the cure  
You may be a bitter divorce  
Wandering what he saw in her  
When it all comes down  
When it all comes down baby  
When it all comes down to it  
  
[Chorus]

I think I know the way, the story's gonna end  
It's getting to the part I hate, when heartache close in.  
The stage is set, it's time for me to leave  
Cause I don't want to see the final scene.  
  
Fade to blue  
We didn't make it through  
Let the curtain fall  
And fade to blue  
  
We played the part of lovers  
Knew every line by heart  
But sometimes love just can't erase  
What's written in the stars  
So before the bitter words come crashing down  
Let's leave what's left, and the lights go out  
  
And fade to blue  
We didn't make it through  
There won't be a curtain call  
Just fade to blue  
  
Almost happy endings have no way of coming true  
Once the feelings starts to fade to blue  
We didn't make it through  
So let the curtain fall  
Just fade to blue  
And fade to blue

As I look at the letters  
That you wrote to me  
It's you that I am thinking of  
As I read the lines  
That to me were so dear  
I remember our faded love  
  
I miss you darlin' more and more everyday  
As Heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
As I think of the past  
And all the pleasures we had  
As I watch the mating of the doves  
It was in the springtime  
That you said good-bye  
And I remember our faded love  
  
I miss you darlin' more and more every day  
As Heaven would miss the stars above  
With every heartbeat I still think of you  
And remember our faded love  
  
And remember our faded love

Mama's crying again, her baby's nowhere to be found  
The world has gone taken her away  
Daddy went and ran off with some white trash half his age  
Left me at home to pay for his mistakes  
My sister held my hand when that bad boy broke my heart  
Ain't no miles ain't no man could ever tear us apart  
  
[Chorus:]  
Now here I stand on roots that deep  
We laugh we cry we hurt we bleed  
We're best of friends and worst enemies  
We're all to blame, we're all the same  
Make no apologies  
This is my family  
  
I can't forget the night that Uncle William passed away  
We were forced to recognize his weird disease  
I ran away and ran around with a man twice my age  
Ain't it funny how some things never change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't you try to shame my name  
'Cause 'till the death I will defend  
Yeah this blood runs through my veins  
It's where I start and where I'll end  
Now here I stand on roots that deep  
We laugh we cry we hurt we bleed  
We're best of friends and worst enemies  
We're all to blame, we're all the same  
Make no apologies  
This is my family

In your eyes I find the answers to my questions  
In your arms, yeah, I found the world I've waited for  
In your touch I've found everything I ever needed  
I need nothing more  
  
Always dreamed of the day when  
my dream would find me  
Now my dream's beside me  
You are in my life  
  
In your arms I know where I belong  
I've never known this feeling, oh  
But it feels like home  
In your eyes I know what I can be  
You opened up your heart to me  
And it feels like home  
When I'm with you baby  
It feels like home.  
  
All this time there was not much to believe in  
I kept my faith, yeah, that you were waiting there for me  
I searched this world  
And now my search is finally over  
I found what I believed  
Always hoped for the day  
When my heart would find you  
Now my heart's beside you  
You are in my life  
  
In your arms I know where I belong  
I've never known this feeling, oh  
But it feels like home  
In your eyes I know what I can be  
You've opened up your heart to me  
Oh, and it feels like home  
  
It doesn't matter where I've been  
Or what I've been through  
Cause I know I've been waiting  
Every day of my life  
To be with you, to be with you  
  
In your arms I know where I belong  
I've never known this feeling before  
But it feels like home  
In your eyes I know what I can be  
You've opened up your heart to me, oh  
And it feels like home  
  
When I'm with you baby, it feels like home  
When I'm with you baby, it feels like home  
Feels like home, feels like home  
Feels like home, feels like home  
Feels like home, feels like home  
It feels like home

Up and down the stairs  
In and out the door  
Walked every inch of the floor  
You think you know a place  
But there locked in an empty room  
Out of the dark comes you  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
A flood of light fall on my face  
I see, I see, I see  
For the first time  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
What is this fallin'  
No dancin' down my cheek  
Why's it hard for me to speak?  
You think you know a heart  
But then it suddenly starts to pound  
It literally knocks you down  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
A flood of light fall on my face  
I see, I see, I see  
For the first time  
(For the first time)  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
Yeah, for the first time  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
A flood of light  
I see, I see, I see  
For the first time  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
I feel, I feel, I feel  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
For the first time  
I hurt, I hurt, I hurt  
So good inside I swear I could die  
I love, I love, I love  
For the first time  
Oh, for the first time  
For the first time  
For the first time  
Ooh  

Baby, baby, baby, baby, listen what I say  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, let me have my way  
I'm gonna keep on knockin' till the door unlatches  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, when it's cold and dark  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you make me feel a spark  
Well I feel a spark and the fire catches  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
You pull my pin and you trip my wire  
Yeah well you come in and set my heart on fire  
You knock me out, you rock me off my axis  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, when you make your move  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, I can feel your groove  
The resistance of a strong willed man's in ashes  
You and me are gasoline and matches  
  
Oh you pull my pin and you trip my wire  
Yeah well you come in and set my heart on fire  
You knock me out, you rock me off my axis  
You and me You and me  
  
Baby I'm incarcerated and I don't want out  
Baby we should get related  
'cause there ain't no doubt  
Yeah but when your heart and my heart attaches  
You and me are Gasoline and Matches  
You and me are Gasoline and Matches  
You and me, yeah  
  
Well you pull my pin and then you trip my wire  
You come on in you come on in  
And set my heart on fire  
You knock me out, knock me out  
Knock me off of my axis  
You and me, you and me we're  
Gasoline and matches  
Gonna knock knock knock knock  
Until the door unlatches  
You and me are gasoline and matches

Everybody's reachin' for something  
Every day pullin' and tugging  
And always wantin' a little more  
Holdin' on to her like an anchor  
Treatin' those we love like strangers  
Takin' names and keeping score  
We all know, what we're really after  
Somewhere along the road, we got it backwards  
  
If you want to get love then give it  
If you want to feel some forgiveness  
Then you've gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own  
If you want a friend then be one  
A little bit of kindness, show some  
You'll be surprised at how much finds it's way back home  
It don't matter what it is  
If you want it, give.  
  
I been down right stubborn,  
At one time or another,  
And found it easier to bend.  
I've had a shoulder to lean on  
Been the one who got to be strong  
And peace was waiting at both ends  
I've felt the power, I've seen what it can do  
It's seemed so simple, so simple that it's true  
  
If you want to get love then give it  
If you want to feel some forgiveness  
Then you've gotta let go and do some forgiving of your own  
If you want a friend then be one  
A little bit of kindness, show some  
You'll be surprised at how much finds it's way back home  
It don't matter what it is  
If you want it, give.  
  
If you want a friend then be one  
A little bit of kindness show some  
You'll be surprised of how much finds it's way back home  
It don't matter what it is  
If you want it, give.

Hear that lonesome whippoorwill  
He sounds too blue to fly.  
The midnight train is whining low.  
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.  
  
I've never seen a night so long  
When time goes crawling by.  
The moon just went behind a cloud  
To hide it's face and cry.  
  
Did you ever see a Robin weep  
When leaves begin to die,  
That means he's lost the will to live.  
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.  
  
The silence of a falling star  
Lights up a purple sky.  
And as I wonder just where you are  
I'm So Lonesome I Could Cry.

I got a feelin' called blue'ue'ues  
Oh lord  
Since my baby said good-bye  
I'd don't what I'm gonna do  
All I do is sit and sigh  
Oh lord  
The last long day said good-bye  
Well I know how hard I would cry  
  
He'll do me  
He'll do you  
He's got that kinda lovin'  
Lord I love to hear it  
When he calls me sweet baby  
Such a beautiful dream  
I had to think it all o'over  
I lost my heart it seems  
  
Well I got some esteem somehow  
I'm nobody's sugar baby now  
I got the lo'o'onesome  
I've got the lovesick blues  
  
Well I'm in love  
I'm in love  
With a wonderful guy  
That's what's the matter with me  
I'm in love  
I'm in love with a wonderful guy  
But he don't care about me  
  
Well I've tried and tried  
To keep him satisfied  
But he just can't see  
And now that he is lea'ea'eavin'  
That is all I can say  
  
I got a feelin' called blue'ue'ues  
Oh lord  
Since my baby said good-bye  
I don't know what I'm gonna do'o'o  
All I do is sit and sigh, oh lord  
The last long day said good-bye  
Well I know how hard I would cry  
  
He'll do me  
He'll do you  
He's got that kinda lovin'  
Lord I love to hear it  
When he calls me sweet ba'a'aby  
Such a beautiful dream  
I had to think it all over  
I lost my heart it seems  
Well I've gone so  
Just for that man somehow  
I'm nobody's sugar baby now  
I got the lo'o'onesome  
I've got the lovesick blues, yeah  
I got the lo'o'onesome  
I've got the lovesick blues

How long has it been  
can't remember when  
yeah, it's been awhile  
years look good on you  
but I expect them to  
I sure missed that smile  
Look you got me grinning  
bet I'm blushing too  
don't have to be a genius  
to see the honest truth  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's just how it's been  
there's that kind of message  
like we were back when  
Sure I've gone on since you baby  
lost my heart a time or two  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's it, I just do  
The leaves begin to change  
the first frost is back again  
all the cards and pumpkin pie  
Jingle Bells, and Silent Night  
And an all familiar end  
I can't deny  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's just how it's been  
there's that kind of message  
like we were back when  
Sure I've gone on since you baby  
lost my heart a time or two  
I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's it, I just do  
Ooh, I miss you like Christmas baby  
that's it, ooh, I just do

If I woke up tomorrow  
And my eyes could not see  
In darkness there'd be beauty  
Of the love you shown to me  
  
Cause I love longer and wider  
Deeper and higher  
Cause I've been loved  
More than anyone deserves  
  
If tomorrow for some reason  
Somehow I could not hear  
In silence there'd be music  
Of a love that's always here  
  
Cause I love longer and wider  
Deeper and higher  
Cause I've been loved  
More than anyone deserves  
  
And if I woke up in heaven  
And I could not feel your touch  
Then I want to be your angel  
And I love you just as much  
  
Cause I love longer and wider  
Deeper and higher  
Cause I've been loved  
  
I've been loved  
I've been loved

My baby gives me satisfaction  
My baby gives me all his love  
Let's me know I'm his main attraction  
No one else is gonna feel his touch  
I love the way he drives me crazy  
From now on I'm gonna love my baby  
  
My baby is a full-time lover  
My baby is a full-grown man  
Makes me feel like a natural woman  
I know he's the only one who can  
Rock my world and I don't mean maybe  
From now on I'm gonna love my baby  
  
No one else can take me away from my baby  
I'm holding on to heaven in his arms  
No one can take me away from my baby  
I'm holding on to heaven in his arms  
  
My baby is a rolling thunder  
My baby is a south-bound train  
His love is like a long, hot summer  
Calms me down like a cool, cool rain  
His sweet wonderful ways amaze me  
It's no wonder why I love my baby

Oh, say can you see,  
By the dawn's early light,  
What so proudly we hailed,  
At the twilight's last gleaming?  
Whose broad stripes and bright stars,  
Through the perilous fight,  
O'er the ramparts we watched,  
Were so gallantly streaming.  
And the rocket's red glare,  
The bombs bursting in air,  
Gave proof through the night,  
That our flag was still there.  
Oh say does that star spangled banner yet wave,  
For the land of the free, and the home of the brave.

You've got me wrapped up  
In you  
Somehow you led me in  
Into your web of bittersweet  
Of ecstasy and sin  
I feel like an angel falling  
Down from grace  
  
[Chorus]  
I try to run but I keep  
On falling  
And every time I turn around  
I hear your voice,  
And it keeps on calling  
I'm bound  
There's no way out  
No way out  
  
You wanted me to want  
You and  
I couldn't help myself  
You became my addiction  
And I wanted nothing else  
I feel like I'm trapped inside  
These walls  
Trying to find my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It's like a dream you can't  
Wake up from  
It's a hunger that can't be  
Satisfied  
No matter how I try there's  
No escape  
  
[Chorus]

Hung my cotton dress on rusted wire  
Up there on Pilahatchee Bridge  
Just a crazy roughneck's daughter  
Jumped head-first into the water  
Baptized away my sins  
  
Hitched to town with Bobby Jo and Tommy  
Couple of lookers, new best friends  
We slipped in the back of Sunday service  
Know them church ladies, they heard us  
Bum smoke money from the offering  
  
Mama said, "Idle hands are Devil's handy work"  
Oh, the trouble you'll get into  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
Yea yea yea yea  
  
Oh, yeah  
  
Sign read: bait, chips beer and ammunition  
That Slim-Jim bag boy hadn't a prayer  
Well I hiked my skirt and did the talkin'  
While them boys were busy walkin'  
Case of .5 out the back door  
  
Hid deep in the Mississippi backwoods  
We danced and played around 'til dark  
Well I had them wrestlin' for my first kiss  
Turned into a fight and they missed  
Me speeding off in Tommy's car  
  
Mama said, "Idle hands are Devil's handy work"  
Oh, the trouble you'll get into  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
Yea yea yea yea  
  
Nobody hurt, nobody harmed  
Nobody's busines but my own  
  
Mama said, "Idle hands are Devil's handwork  
Oh, the trouble you'll get into!"  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
You got nothin' better to do, got nothin' better to do  
Yea yea yea yea  
  
Oh, yeah  
Got nothin' better to do, babe  
Got nothin' better to do  
You got nothin' better to do, babe  
Ya got nothin' better to do, no no  
Got nothin' better to do!  
Ya got nothin' better to do, no no  
Got nothin' better to do!  
You got nothin' better to do, no no!

Like a cloud full of rain shouldn't hang in the sky  
Ice shouldn't burn or a bumble bee fly  
If you feel so happy, then why do you cry  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
Like an ocean liner shouldn't float on the sea  
A pearl in an oyster or a circus of fleas  
Someone so perfect can't be fallin' for me  
Oh nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
[Chorus]  
Nothin' 'bout love is less than confusin'  
You can win when you're losin'  
Stand when you're fallin'  
I can't figure it out  
Nothin' 'bout love can make an equation  
Nothin' short of amazin'  
Wish I could explain it  
But I didn't know how  
  
The way that we dance  
The reason we dream  
That big Italian tower  
Oh, how does it lean  
Somethin' so strong shouldn't make me this weak  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like the lights of Las Vegas glowin' out of the sand  
A jumbo shrimp or a baby grand  
How you touch my heart when you hold my hand  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense  
Oh, nothin' 'bout love makes sense

Nowhere to go  
All night took everything  
Another nice try with Mr. Wrong  
Late night TV on my horizon  
National anthem and I'm barely hangin' on  
  
Just a typical Saturday night  
Feeling like the rest of my life  
  
There was nothing new under the moon  
Same old dance, same old tune  
Just wishes on stars that never came true  
Just one more night to get through  
But there was nothing new under the moon, 'till you  
  
Hey what a change  
Hey what a concept  
Here's a true heart waiting mine  
News Flash! Who'd ever thought you could  
Have the same feeling at the very same time?  
  
Look at what your love's doing to me  
I can't believe I used to believe  
There was nothing new under the moon  
Same old dance, same old tune  
Just wishes on stars that never came true  
Just one more night to get through  
But there was nothing new under the moon, 'till you  
  
Nothing new under the moon  
Same old dance, same old tune  
Just wishes on stars that never came true  
Just one more night to get through  
There was nothing new under the moon, 'till you  
Nothin' new under the moon, 'till you  
Nothin' new under the moon  
  
Nothin' new under the moon, 'till you  
Nothin' new under the moon  
  
There was nothing new under the moon, 'till you

I would've slipped off my jeans  
And slipped on my heels  
If I knew that I would see you  
Yeah, this diamond ring, gets kinda loose  
Gotta watch myself around you  
Glad you finally said something  
Cause it's been weighin' on my mind  
And messin' with my life  
I wonder should I feel guilty  
But we've haven?t crossed that line  
  
We ain't doin' nothin' wrong  
Nothin' wrong as long as we keep it innocent  
I'm just tryin' to have some fun  
But baby you're drivin' me crazy  
I ain't tryin' to make you crazy  
For me it ain't much that fun  
If we ain't doin' nothin' wrong  
  
If you only knew  
What you do to me  
When you walk away  
If I had chance, gave you a taste  
Baby you'd be beggin' me to stay  
Yeah, sometimes I wonder what it'd feel like  
But I gotta good man, and I'm a damn good wife  
And I don't wanna feel guilty  
But it's getting awfully hard to believe  
  
I'd never ask you  
Would you leave the one you love  
I'd never tell you  
I want you so bad it hurts  
I like the way you make me feel  
Baby can we make it real  
If we don?t make it real  
Then we aint' doin' nothin' wrong

I've never been so certain,  
I've never been so sure.  
We're on the side of angels,  
If we believe this love is pure.  
  
Is it so hard to trust it,  
'Cause we've been wrong before?  
There comes a time in every life,  
We find the heart we're waiting for.  
  
After all the might-have-beens,  
The close and distant calls  
After all the try-agains,  
Don't be afraid to fall  
We're on the side of angels after all.  
  
Every time you touch me,  
Don't you feel it too?  
The gentle hand that's guiding us  
You to me, me to you  
  
After all the might-have-beens,  
The close and distant calls  
After all the try-agains,  
Don't be afraid to fall  
We're on the side of angels after all.  
  
Heaven only knows  
Why this took so long  
But only Heaven knows  
A love is right or wrong  
  
After all the might-have-beens,  
The close and distant calls  
After all the try-agains,  
Don't be afraid to fall  
We're on the side of angels,  
On the side of angels  
  
We're on the side of angels  
After all,  
Oh, yeah  
On the side of Angels  
Oh

You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
one day to long  
  
I'm the kind of woman who understands  
How the road can be so hard on a traveling man  
I don't mind giving you a little room to breathe  
Then you go and take advantage of my generosity  
I'm home, waiting  
Alone, aching  
Your times run out cause  
Yesterday this love could have been saved  
Just crawl back out ain't no way  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long  
  
You know, I ain't a once in a while kind of thang  
You see, love is being here for each other  
Even with you standing right here, right now  
right in front of my face  
You're still looking right through me  
Well, let me clear something up for you honey  
  
I called you up  
Told you I was  
Missing, needing  
To be soothed by you  
Keep your reasons  
I'm done pleasing  
Ain't it funny now  
I'm leaving, and your the one who's being left behind  
God sent me a man who will give me my time  
  
You been gone  
You been gone  
You been gone one day  
One day too long

Wish someone would tell me when  
I won't think of you again.  
  
I'll get past the emptiness and  
Let a little happiness back in.  
  
Pretending I don't care,  
Leaves me half way there.  
  
One of these, one of these days  
I'll be completely over you.  
Heaven knows how long it will take.  
And one of these, one of these days  
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away  
One of these days  
  
One of these days  
Some how, some way  
  
Ever since you've been gone,  
Time has a way of dragging on and on.  
  
Friends drive by for company,  
But I'm not much company for long.  
  
Oh I'll get past what was,  
If I live long enough  
  
One of these, one of these days  
I'll be completely over you.  
Heaven knows how long it will take.  
And one of these, one of these days  
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away (some way)  
  
One of these days  
Some how, some way  
  
One of these, one of these days  
I'll be completely over you.  
Heaven knows how long it will take.  
And one of these, one of these days  
I'll find somebody who'll love your memories away  
One of these days  
  
One of these days (one of these days)  
One of these days (some how, some way)  
One of these days (one of these days)

Time, sometimes the time just slips away  
And you're left with yesterday  
Left with the memories  
I, I'll always think of you and smile  
And be happy for the time I had you with me  
Though we go our separate ways  
I won't forget so don't forget  
The memories we made  
  
Please remember  
Please remember  
When I was there for you  
And you were there for me  
Please remember  
Our time together  
When time was yours and mine  
And we were wild and free  
Please remember please remember me  
  
Good-bye, there's just no sadder word to say  
And it's sad to walk away  
With just the memories  
Who's to know what might have been  
We leave behind a life and time  
We'll never know again  
  
Please remember  
Please remember  
When I was there for you  
And you were there for me  
And remember please remember me  
  
Please remember  
Please remember  
When I was there for you  
And you were there for me  
Please remember  
Our time together  
When time was yours and mine  
And we were wild and free  
Then remember please remember me  
  
And how we laughed  
And how we smiled  
And how this world was yours and mine  
And how no dream was out of reach  
I stood by you, you stood by me  
We took each day and made it shine  
We wrote our names across the sky  
We ran so fast we ran so free  
And I had you and you had me  
Please remember

Mama's high heels, cherry lipstick  
And a goodwill dress  
Play pretending, danced for the mirror  
A fairytale princess  
  
[Chorus:]  
Pretty things are yours to hold  
My pretty thing soon you will know  
Pretty things you think you need  
But don't make you beautiful  
Pretty things will rot with love  
Pretty things will fade with time  
It's what's inside that makes you shine  
  
My pretty thing  
  
It's only natural, the table's turning  
And gracefully I'll learn  
How to cradle the one who raised me  
Will be too fragile for this world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Selfless and faithful  
As good as you should be  
Open and fearless  
Oh, what a gift you gave  
  
[Chorus]

Feel the cold wind blowing-winter's coming on  
Tis the season, so they say  
If you need help believing 'cause your spirit ain't too strong  
Hold my hand--we'll push that cloud away  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you want to join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart  
  
There's a man on the corner who doesn't have a name  
People pass and turn their heads away  
But to share a simple kindness would set your heart aflame  
And you'll get more than you'll ever give away  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you want to join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart  
  
It starts with you, it starts with me  
That ain't no stranger, he's family and it don't matter if we agree  
It all comes down to love  
  
Put a little holiday in your heart  
It'll put a little shuffle in your step  
Give you a song that you can sing  
With a melody you can't forget  
And if you want to join in a little harmony  
To keep the world from tearin' apart  
Well you know where to look  
Yeah--you gotta put a little holiday in your heart

Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree let the Christmas spirit ring  
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie and we'll do some caroling  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing  
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree, have a happy holiday  
Everyone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way, hey  
  
You will get a sentimental feeling, when you hear voices singing  
"Let's be jolly, deck the halls with boughs of holly"  
  
Rockin' around the Christmas tree at the Christmas party hop  
Mistletoe hung where you can see every couple tries to stop  
  
Rocking around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday  
Everyone's dancing merrily in the new old-fashioned way  
Rocking around the Christmas tree have a happy holiday

Everybody's talkin' bout something  
A lot of static and a lot of nothin'  
Pollutin' the air with who the hell cares kinda gossip  
Headlines to spare in our pockets in our pockets  
It's a shame but we could all stop it  
Tell a neighbor tell a friend it ain't a 60's thing  
We still need a little help  
  
[Chorus]  
Rumor bout a revolution  
Spread a little soul solution  
Let it stir in the wind  
Come on let a chance begin  
Raise a hand not a fist  
Yeah ignorance ain't bliss if it leaves us in ruins  
Rumor bout a revolution  
  
Ain't it easy passing judgment  
Just to entertain ourselves  
I'm not here pointing fingers  
Been guilty myself  
You see there's a bigger picture  
With a million point of views  
Well love ain't a color  
It's a damn strong mother  
And it ain't gonna lie  
  
Rumor bout a revolution  
Spread a little soul solution  
Let it stir in the wind  
Come on let a chance begin  
Raise a hand not a fist  
Yeah ignorance ain't bliss if it leaves us in ruins  
Rumor bout a revolution  
  
Tell a neighbor tell a friend it ain't a 60's thing  
We still need a little help  
  
[Chorus]

I'm sittin' on my porch  
And watchin' the flowers bloom  
I walk through my front door  
Everything is perfect in every room  
But something's wrong 'round here  
I'm always fighting back the tears  
And even when you come home  
I still feel all alone  
  
I need you to find me  
I'm the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
You made it look so pretty  
Such a beautiful family, such wonderful friends  
But how we're going so dirty  
I don't know what's real  
'cause it all feels pretend  
But something's missing here  
I'm always drowning in my fears  
I've gotta take care of myself  
Before there's left  
  
I need you to find me  
I'm the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
I'm more than just a pretty face  
I'm more than just your wife  
I have my hopes and my dreams too  
This is our song, my love  
I need you  
I want you  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
I have my hopes and my dreams too, yeah  
This is our song, my love  
  
I need you to find me  
I'm the one you left behind  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time  
  
I need you, find me  
I have no where left to hide  
I want you to see me  
'cause we're running out of time.

There is a white flag rising,  
About to catch the wind  
And I don't want to fight it,  
Or let you win  
Here I stand,  
Heart in hand  
No it ain't like me,  
Don't take it lightly  
You know I never bend  
  
[Chorus]  
Surrender  
I'm giving in, givin' up  
Surrender  
Crossing over the line for your love  
If I trust enough,  
Then I might just  
Fall in to forever  
And all I've got to do is surrender  
  
I see a white dove flyin,  
The clouds have rolled on past  
And isn't it surprising,  
I feel the peace at last  
Got all I need,  
Surroundin' me  
I'm not afraid to stand up and say,  
I will never leave  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
If I trust enough,  
Then I might just  
Fall into forever  
And all I've got to do,  
All I've got to do  
Baby, all I've got to do,  
Is surrender  
Oh surrender

I can tell you've been crying on the inside  
I can see right through your eyes, what you're to hide  
You've got a real big wall covering up what you're feeling for me  
Well, c'mon baby, work it on out and talk to me  
  
Baby I'm here  
Ready to hear  
What you're saying  
I can hear your heartbeat pounding  
So don't keep me waiting  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
  
I can tell you've been hurt real bad before  
But you're face to face with love knocking at your door  
All your need is al little trust to set you free  
Well, here I am, don't hold back, baby talk to me  
  
Baby I'm here  
Ready to hear  
What you're saying  
I can hear your heartbeat pounding  
So don't keep me waiting  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
  
I cried a tear  
As I felt the pain  
That you hold inside  
But this true love is strong enough to survive  
C'mon and talk to me  
  
Baby I'm here  
Ready to hear  
What you're saying  
I can hear your heartbeat pounding  
So don't keep me waiting  
C'mon baby and talk to me  
C'mon baby and talk to me

Stillness filled the heavens, on crucifixion day.  
Some say it rained, I don't know if it's true.  
Well, I can just imagine ten thousand angels cried  
That would seem like rain to me and you.  
  
The angels all stood ready to take him from the tree  
They waited for the words from his voice.  
And when he asked the father why has thou forsaken me.  
They watched the saviour die of his own choice.  
  
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry  
But I'm sure they did  
As they stood by  
And watched the saviour die.  
  
God turned his head away  
He couldn't bear the sight  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried.  
  
As the sun slipped away  
The skies turned to grey  
And when jesus gave his all  
That's when the tears began to fall  
  
I've never seen ten thousand angels cry  
But I'm sure they did  
As they stood by  
And watched the saviour die.  
  
God turned his head away  
He couldn't bear the sight  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried.  
  
It must have looked like rain  
When ten thousand angels cried.

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Front nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like eskimos  
Everybody knows some turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is going spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
To kids from one to ninety-two  
Although it's been said many times, many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

Went through the attic today  
Found a note you wrote packed away.  
And I started reliving the past  
When I saw his face.  
  
Suddenly to my surprise  
I felt a tear fall from my eyes.  
The heart never forgets  
No the heart never forgets.  
  
You can find someone  
And live your life  
Put an old memory out of your mind  
But the heart never forgets.  
  
A face on a crowded street  
An old movie on T.V.,  
A song on the radio  
Can bring it all back.  
  
Years roll by,  
One by one,  
All things change,  
But there's always someone,  
The heart never forgets,  
No the heart never forgets.  
  
You can find someone,  
And live your life,  
Put an old memory out of your mind,  
But the heart never forgets.  
  
The heart never forgets,  
No the heart never forgets.  
You can find someone,  
And live your life,  
Put an old memory out of your mind,  
But the heart never forgets.  
No the heart never forgets.  
Ooh, yeah.  
Dawn

Life can take your dreams and turn them upside down  
Friends will talk about you when you're not around  
Reality can really cut you down to size  
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
  
People make you promises they'll never keep  
Soon you'll know why people say talk is cheap  
And life resembles one big compromise  
But don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
  
Keep on shining  
Keep on smiling  
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart  
When you're crying  
Just keep trying to remind yourself  
you're a shining star  
Yes you are  
  
Somewhere down the line you'll face the judgment day  
When the angels look at you, what will they say?  
They've got a way of knowing who qualifies  
Just let 'em see that light in your eyes  
  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Keep on shining  
Keep on smiling  
Don't lose faith and don't lose heart  
When you're crying  
Just keep trying to remind yourself you're a shining star  
Yes you are  
  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Don't ever lose that light in your eyes  
Don't ever lose  
Don't ever lose

Saw you across the room  
Felt somethin' stir inside my soul  
Knew I'd never be the same  
Now that love had taken hold  
Then when you touched me  
There was no doubt  
You understood what my heart was all about  
  
And the rest is history  
The story of you and me  
For all eternity  
The record will show  
We'll fill up the pages  
Romance for the ages  
There for the world to see  
The rest is history  
  
Before we spoke a word  
My heart told me you were the one  
When you pressed your hand to mine  
I knew my life had just begun  
Like some old movie  
Music filled the night  
Lost held each other tight.  
  
And the rest is history  
The story of you and me  
For all eternity  
The record will show  
We'll fill up the pages  
Romance for the ages  
There for the world to see  
The rest is history  
  
And the rest is history  
The story of you and me  
For all eternity  
The record will show  
We'll fill up the pages  
Romance for the ages  
There for the world to see  
The rest is history  
  
History  
The rest is history.  
The rest is history.

Some say love it is a river  
That drowns the tender reed.  
Some say love it is a razor  
That leaves your soul to bleed.  
  
Some say love it is a hunger  
An endless, aching need  
I say love it is a flower,  
And you it's only seed.  
  
It's the heart afraid of breaking  
That never learns to dance  
It's the dream afraid of waking  
That never takes the chance  
  
It's the one who won't be taken,  
Who cannot seem to give  
And the soul afraid of dying  
That never learns to live.  
  
And the night has been too lonely  
And the road has been too long.  
And you think that love is only  
For the lucky and the strong.  
  
Just remember in the winter  
Far beneath the bitter snow  
Lies the seed that with the sun's love,  
In the spring, becomes a rose.

Daytime, I'm fine  
Everything is back to normal  
Last night, I thought that I would die  
I had nightmares  
I was so scared  
Thank God that you are by my side  
To hold me when I cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to be strong  
But I don't want to be alone tonight  
I want to believe that I can save the world  
And make it right, but I'm only human  
And you've got a hero's face  
Right here in your arms  
Is the safest place, the safest place  
  
It feels so real  
You showed me I can trust you  
With emotions I had locked away  
It was your touch, your words  
They heal the deepest part of me  
That only you can see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
As long as I am with you  
As long as I can feel you  
That's all I need to keep me going  
On and on and on and on  
  
[Chorus]

From the beginning of this own world,  
Man has shed a million tears.  
Tears for the pain they've had  
In their lives and for all the  
Wasted years.  
But the saddest tears that ever fell,  
Fell not from just any man's eyes.  
But they were shed by my Savior  
And they stained The Sands Of Time.  
As the Father looked upon His Son,  
He had to turn His face away.  
And as Jesus hung upon that cross,  
He gave His all for us that day.  
And as the tears ran down His face,  
As He cried, mixed with the blood  
That flowed from His side. Oh what  
A sacrifice of love and it stained  
The Sands Of Time.  
  
  
Oh yes it stained The Sands Of Time.  
It stained The Sands Of Time.  
The blood that was shed for a lost  
And dying world,  
Oh yes it stained  
The Sands Of Time..... of time.  

Accept me for who I am  
That I'm only human  
And there are more important things  
Then what we fight about  
We won't always see eye to eye  
We say hurtful things, sometimes  
And it gets hard when you love someone so much  
  
Everybody's got highs, and lows  
It's alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows, it's alright  
Oh, It's the weight of love  
  
Remember our first kiss  
And how we melted in our seats  
There will never be a January  
As warm in Tennessee  
It was an angel in the night  
Nothing's ever felt so right  
And even the stars over our backyard  
Don't shine sometimes  
  
Everybody's got highs, and lows  
It's alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows, it's alright  
Oh, It's the weight of love  
  
We will grow old together  
Even for worse or better  
Nothing will ever keep us apart  
  
Everybody's got highs, and lows  
It's alright  
Its the weight of love  
Highs and lows, it's alright  
Oh, It's the weight of love

In every life there are detours on dirt gravel roads,  
Sometimes it feels like there's just no right way to go,  
There'll be times you'll go crazy,  
And times you'll break down,  
Always something that stands in your way  
  
[Chorus]  
Just keep your eyes on me  
Never lose site of me  
This love  
Nothing can come between  
Us when we're following  
This love  
  
This love  
  
Everybody is bound to feel lost now and then,  
But I'll be the one thing, that'll be there For you 'til the end,  
Through good days and bad  
The ups and the downs  
Don't you ever let go of your dreams,  
Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bridge:  
I'll be your northern star  
When everything's dark  
I will shine for you  
Shine for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just keep your eyes on me  
Never lose site of me  
This love  
Nothing can come between  
Us when we're following  
This love  
Oh uh-huh  
Oh  
This love

Come inside my walls of  
Ecstasy, with me  
Close the door and throw away  
The key  
That's the way you can start by  
Moving in nice and slow  
Taking your time to move  
Down low  
'cause everything you do is  
Everything I need  
Lights are low, so here we go,  
Let's get busy  
  
[Chorus]  
Hands on the clock  
Time to make my body rock  
Move with me, you get me  
So hot that I can't stop  
Tic Toc  
You got the spot  
Here I come ready or not  
So hot that I can't stop  
Tic Toc, Tic Toc baby  
Tic Toc, Tic Toc baby  
  
You opened up my world to  
Paradise, so nice  
Feels so good my body  
Liquefies  
When you touch me I lose  
Control and start to shake  
Your love is so good I ain't  
Gotta fake  
'cause everything you do is  
Everything I like  
The plot thickens, time's tick'n,  
You're my toy tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tic Toc the clock keeps  
On tick'n  
Hurry up before it gets too late  
Tic Toc the clock keeps on  
Tick'n  
Hurry up before it gets too late  
  
A little to the left  
A little to the right  
A little bit longer  
All the way tonight  
I close my eyes, my body  
Tenes  
Boy your touch hits all my  
Senses  
Don't stop  
Come on  
I'm almost there  
In the middle of the night  
Reality stops  
And I'm suspended  
In your arms  
As I melt from your touch  
  
[Chorus: x2]

(feat. Bon Jovi)  
  
It might be hard to be lovers  
But its harder to be friends  
Baby pull down the covers  
Its time you let me in  
Maybe light a couple candles  
Ill just go ahead and lock the door  
If you just talk to me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Lay your head on my pillow  
I sit beside you on the bed  
Dont you think its time we say  
Some things we havent said  
It aint too late to get back to that place  
Back to where, we thought it was before  
Why dont you look at me  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
Sometimes its hard to love me  
Sometimes its hard to love you too  
I know its hard believing  
That love can pull us through  
It would be so easy  
To live your life  
  
With one foot out the door  
Just hold me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
[Solo]  
  
Its hard to find forgivness  
When we just run out of lies  
Its hard to say youre sorry  
When you cant tell wrong from right  
It would be so easy  
To spend your whole damn life  
Just keeping score  
So lets get down to it baby  
There aint no need to lie  
  
Tell me who you think you see  
When you look into my eyes  
Lets put our two hearts back together  
And we'll leave the broken pieces on the floor  
Make love with me baby  
Til we aint strangers anymore  
  
We're not strangers anymore  
We're not strangers  
We're not strangers anymore

Life can be distance between us  
Days even years could pass on  
But the love that lies between us will  
Always be worth holdin' on  
  
Together, forever, always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are we're  
Together, forever, always  
  
I could try to forget you but the  
Memories keep lingering on  
But the dreams I dream about  
You keep me holdin' on  
  
Together, forever, always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are we're  
Together, forever, always  
  
Together, forever, always  
From the dawn til the end  
Of each day no matter  
How far away you are we're  
Together, forever, always

It ain't working  
Don't take no genius to see  
It's hurting more every day  
Goin' through the motions  
Ain't we  
And it's too sad for me  
Once we were  
True lovers  
Feeling the heat  
  
Oh, but I  
Can't say the word we have to say  
Don't ask me why  
Let's just say  
  
[Chorus]  
See ya round, gotta go  
Sayonara, adios,  
Arrivederci  
Au revoir, auf Wiedersehen,  
Ciao bella, never change  
Oh mercy mercy  
Don't make me cry  
I got trouble with goodbye  
  
Don't explain it away  
Cause, it just ain't my thing  
All this articulating  
Just a little heartbreak  
Why make it more than it seems  
I'd much rather  
Get back to dreamin' my dreams  
  
See cause I've been thinkin'  
we'll meet again someday  
But until we do  
Let's just say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Wish I could be so free  
Yeah they take it so casually  
Oh but baby that's just not me  
Oh no I've never been  
And I will never be  
Cause I've got, I got trouble  
babe  
Oh no I don't really want to go  
Don't want to say the words  
Don't want to say goodbye  
  
[Chorus]

Oh my love  
My darling  
I've hungered for your touch  
A long lonely time  
  
As time goes by so slowly  
And time can do so much  
Are you still mine?  
  
I need your love  
I need your love  
God speed your love  
To me  
  
Lonely rivers flow  
To the sea  
To the sea  
To the open arms  
Of the sea  
  
Lonely rivers sigh  
"Wait for me, wait for me"  
I'll be coming home  
Wait for me.  
  
Oh my love  
My darling  
I've hungered, hungered for your touch  
A long lonely time  
  
And I know that time goes by so slowly  
That time can do so much  
Are you still mine?  
I need your love  
I need your love  
God speed your love  
To me  
Ooo ooo

Being here together  
Is like dreaming wide awake  
Once you've found perfection  
You know it's no mistake  
Too many times  
I've tried too hard  
To make love become real  
You showed me how  
My life can change  
When love is meant to be  
  
It's undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
  
You can change direction  
You can change your mind  
Cold sky and close your eyes  
But the sun's still gonna shine  
'Cause when the magic comes your way  
And you say it isn't real  
Yeah!  
There's no use to try to lie  
About the way you make me feel  
  
It's undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
  
I can't turn it down  
(I can't turn it down)  
No one else can turn it around  
It's the truest thing I've ever found  
  
It's undeniable  
Your love is undeniable  
It's undeniable  
True love is undeniable  
It's undeniable

They'll try to stop the dream we're dreamin'  
But they can't stop us from believing  
They will fill your head with doubt  
But that won't stop us now  
So let them say we can't do it  
Put up a road block  
We'll just run right through it 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
We can do the impossible  
We have the power in our hands  
And we won't stop 'cause we've got  
To make a difference in this life  
With one voice, one heart, two hands, we can  
  
They say the odds are stacked against us  
But that can't hold us back, we will be relentless  
There's a voice they're gonna hear  
A voice so loud and clear  
So let them say we can't do it, give us a mountain, and we're gonna move it
'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We're gonna make a change today (make a change today)  
Because we've got the faith it takes  
To win this race, so let them say we can't do it  
Put up a road block  
And we'll just run right through it 'cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I can (oh I can)  
Do the impossible (do the impossible)  
I have the power in my hands, and I won't stop  
Cause I've got to make a difference in this life  
With my one voice, one heart, two hands, we can

I see trees that are green, red roses too  
I see them bloom for me and you  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
I see skies of blue, and clouds of white  
The bright blessed day, dark sacred night  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
The colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky  
Are also on the faces of the people passing by  
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"  
But they're really saying, "I love you"  
  
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow  
They'll learn much more, than I'll ever know  
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
  
I think to myself, what a wonderful world  
Oh yeah

I know what makes me comfortable  
And I know what makes me tick  
And I when I need to get my way  
I know how to pour it on thick  
  
Cream and sugar in my coffee  
Right away when I wake  
I face a day, and pray to God  
I won't make the same mistakes  
  
[Chorus]  
All the rest is out of my hands  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to love what I cannot change  
But I will change, yeah I will change  
Whatever I, whatever I can  
  
Yeah I don't know my father  
Or my mother well enough  
It seems like every time we talk  
We can't get passed the little stuff  
The pain is self-inflicted  
I know it's not good for me health  
Yeah but it's easier to please the world  
Then it is to please myself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well I know I can't care about how everyone else really feels  
I have enough hurt of my own to heal  
  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to let go what I cannot change  
I will learn to forgive what I cannot change  
I will learn to love what I cannot change  
But I will change, yeah I will change  
Whatever I, whatever I can

Why does the color of my coffee match your eyes  
Why do I see you when this stranger passes by  
I swear I hear you in the whisper of the wind  
I feel you when the sun is dancing on my skin  
And when it's raining you won't find me complaining 'cause  
  
Chorus  
When I think about rain I think about singin  
When I think about singin it's a Heavenly Tune  
When I think about Heaven then I think about Angels  
When I think about Angels I think about you  
  
The taste of sugar sure reminds me of your kiss  
I like the way that they both linger on my lips  
Kisses remind me of a field of butterflies  
It must be the way my heart is fluttering inside  
Beautiful distraction. You make every thought a change reaction  
  
Chorus  
  
Anywhere I go  
Anything I do  
Everything around me baby makes me think of you  
  
Chorus x 3

Looks like she really did you in  
You're a broken hearted lover  
Just tryin' to recover  
You need to find a place to mend  
All your time ain't necessary  
But I don't want to be a temporary thing  
Gimme just half a chance  
  
When this woman loves a man  
She'll do anything she can  
To keep the fire alive in your soul  
And when all the chips are down  
I'm still gonna be the one around  
To build you up and be your friend  
When this woman loves  
When this woman loves a man  
  
Don't play it cool, no don't be shy  
Oh there's no need to worry  
No I'm not in a hurry  
So let your conscience be your guide boy  
Come here and let me show you  
Just how much I adore you  
Let me help you understand  
  
When this woman loves a man  
She'll do anything she can  
To keep the fire alive in your soul  
And when all the chips are down  
I'm still gonna be the one around  
To build you up and be your friend  
When this woman loves  
When this woman loves a man  
  
When this woman loves a man  
She'll do anything she can  
To keep the fire alive in your soul  
And when all the chips are down  
I'm still gonna be the one around  
To build you up and be your friend  
When this woman loves  
When this woman loves a man  
  
When this woman loves  
When this woman loves a man

I think it was me it must have been me  
I guess I did something wrong  
I tried too hard  
Wanted too much  
I guess that's why it's gone  
  
I lost my pride, I fought and cried  
I felt like a little kid  
What's wrong with me?  
Still can't believe  
I did the things I did  
  
I couldn't change him  
He was gonna break my heart  
I saw it coming  
Yeah I knew it from the start  
  
[Chorus:]  
When you love (when you love)  
When you love someone like that, when you give what you can't take back  
When you love (when you love)  
With all your heart and soul, it's so hard to let it go  
When you love someone like that, when you love someone like that  
  
Girl it ain't right, it just ain't right  
Don't tell yourself that it was you  
You followed your heart,you gave it your best  
There's nothing more you can do  
  
Guys like him are like the wind  
And you know it's just too bad  
They blow in and out again and never know what they had  
  
Girl I can tell ya  
He'll do the same to someone else it ain't about you  
So don't be so hard on yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh we've all loved and lost  
It's happened to us all  
I hear what you're saying but I feel like the only one  
You might feel right but you're not  
You're alright (I'm alright)  
You're OK (I'm OK)  
You're gonna make it anyway (both)  
  
When you love (when you love)  
With all your heart and soul, it's so hard to let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're alright (I'm alright)  
You're OK (I'm OK)  
When you love someone like that... When you love

I don't know what I've done  
Or if I like what I've begun  
But something told me to run  
And honey you know me it's all or none  
  
There were sounds in my head  
Little voices whispering  
That I should go and this should end  
Oh and I found myself listening  
  
'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you  
All I know is that I should  
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you  
All I know is that I should  
'Cause she will love you more than I could  
She who dares to stand where I stood  
  
See I thought love was black and white  
That it was wrong or it was right  
But you ain't leaving without a fight  
And I think I am just as torn inside  
  
'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you  
All I know is that I should  
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you  
All I know is that I should  
'Cause she will love you more than I could  
She who dares to stand where I stood  
  
And I won't be far from where you are if ever you should call  
You meant more to me than anyone I ever loved at all  
But you taught me how to trust myself and so I say to you  
This is what I have to do  
  
'Cause I don't know who I am, who I am without you  
All I know is that I should  
And I don't know if I could stand another hand upon you  
All I know is that I should  
'Cause she will love you more than I could  
She who dares to stand where I stood  
Oh, she who dares to stand where I stood

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the treetops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white

Look how the wind carries the sea  
And see how the soul supplies what it needs  
The rain falls, the sun shines and a flower breaks reed  
And it all works together, why can't we  
And I have seen children at play in the park  
Skin shades of ivory, red, yellow and dark  
While my eyes saw colors their little hearts could not see  
They were playing together, why can't we  
Why can't we  
Why can't we  
I can love you and you can love me  
Why can't we  
Why can't we  
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be  
Why can't we  
And I had a dream about a lion and a lamb  
They were laying together and there was peace in the land  
And so it became precious 'cause there were no enemies  
And I woke up and wondered, God why can't we  
Why can't we  
Why can't we  
I can you love you and you can love me  
Why can't we  
Why can't we  
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be  
Why can't we  
Set our foolish pride free, just be and let be  
Why can't we  
Oh, why can't we

A little stretch of river on a big green field  
The kind you see from airplanes baby, that's the deal, that's the deal  
A place to plan a future, a place to keep the past  
A place to raise some kids, and what's wrong with that, wrong with that  
  
Maybe it's the same routine  
Walking on the concrete  
Running like a river so deep  
Wearin' down my high heels  
Wearin' down my high ideals  
Of what I thought my life was supposed to be  
  
Everybody's got a weakness, some kind of kryptonite wearing 'em down  
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of, don't they, baby?  
Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's  
Livin' happily ever afterly  
With you, with you  
  
I want to paint the world with the colors that I see  
Every time I close my eyes and you're kissin' me, kissin' me  
I wanna wake up in your arms so far from here  
I wanna get lost in the dark and know you're near, know you're near  
  
Maybe it's an old love song playing up loud on the radio bringin' these
thoughts on  
Getting me thinking that there might be a little bit more than what I'm
working for  
Or maybe it's just me  
  
Everybody's got a weakness, some kind of kryptonite wearing 'em down  
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of, don't they, baby?  
Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's  
Livin' happily ever afterly  
With you, with you  
  
Everybody's got a weakness  
  
Everybody's got a weakness, some kind of kryptonite wearing 'em down  
Everybody's got dreams they can't let go of, don't they, baby?  
Everybody has a little secret they keep inside and mine's  
Livin' happily ever afterly  
With you, with you  
  
With you

Leave me lonely, just don't keep me hangin on  
These sleepless nights might kill me  
But what don't break me will make me strong  
Enough to get past the past in front of me  
I'll have to pass some memories  
I'll be alright, get by just fine  
Say goodbye and  
  
Bring on he's long gone, done me wrong  
Tears I'm gonna cry  
When you say goodbye, baby I won't be lonely long  
I won't be lonely long  
  
Go on and go on with your life  
Just don't waste one more minute of mine  
Save your precious breath, the one that took mine away  
Once upon a time you had me  
Hangin' on every word, believin everything I heard  
You're leaving sooner or later  
Baby why keep me waitin?  
  
Bring on he's long gone, done me wrong  
Tears I'm gonna cry  
When you say goodbye, baby I won't be lonely long  
I won't be lonely long  
  
I'd be lying sayin I ain't afraid  
But fear of leavin ain't no reason to stay  
Ah, hey  
  
So baby bring on he's long gone, done me wrong  
Tears I'm gonna cry  
When you say goodbye, baby I,  
When you say goodbye, baby I won't be lonely long  
I won't be lonely long  
Yeah, won't be lonely long

Little Carrie Ann what a beautiful girl  
From the moment she was born  
She was always perfect  
Whole town said, " Why can't you be more like her?"  
  
Lights go on and she's ready to spin  
On stage doing all the things she's told to  
Puts on a show in front of the whole damn world  
  
I pray to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause that sweet little angel is not the girl I know  
  
[Chorus]  
She gets wound up  
She gets higher by the minute  
Turns the sound up  
To drown out all the pain  
They all think they know her  
But no one really knows  
That she goes a little crazy sometimes  
  
She parks her car at the top of the hill  
Only inches from the edge  
Where she's almost falling  
Stares at the sky till she's drowning in the rain  
  
Nice dress, nice smile  
What a wonderful child  
If they knew all the lies she's told them  
It's too complicated for her to explain  
  
She prays to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I pray to the heavens to try to save her soul  
Cause the sweet little angel is close to letting go  
  
[Chorus]

I am here to tell you we can never meet again  
Simple really, isn't it, a word or two and then  
A lifetime of not knowing where or how or why or when  
You think of me or speak of me or wonder what befell  
The someone you once loved so long ago so well  
  
Never wonder what I'll feel as living shuffles by  
You don't have to ask me and I need not reply  
Every moment of my life from now until I die  
I will think or dream of you and fail to understand  
How a perfect love can be confounded out of hand  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we had no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?  
  
Nothing can be altered, oh, there is nothing to decide  
No escape, no change of heart, no any place to hide  
You are all I'll ever want, but this I am denied  
Sometimes in my darkest thoughts, I wish I'd never learned  
What it is to be in love and have that love returned  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we had no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?  
  
Is it written in the stars, are we paying for some crime?  
Is that all that we are good for, just a stretch of mortal time?  
Is this God's experiment in which we have no say?  
In which we're given paradise but only for a day?

(One, two, three)  
You, you've made no mistake  
You take everything I ever wanted into account  
When you walk into the room  
You give me, reason  
Talk in turn, never too late or too soon.  
  
You are, poetry in motion  
You inspire, power and devotion  
You are, turning all the tide underneath  
You are, the potential in me  
  
You are  
  
You are, the first one that I wish to tell  
Everything that matters  
Matters because you reflect it back to well  
  
You see understanding  
Wherever you are standing  
Between reason, passion, balance.  
  
You are, poetry in motion  
You inspire, power and devotion  
You are, turning all the tide underneath  
You are, the potential in me  
  
You are, my strongest link  
You are, everything I ever wanted to be, yeah  
  
You are, poetry in motion  
You inspire, power and devotion  
You are, turning all the tide underneath  
Oh yeah.

You are, sensual

So many nights, I'd sit by my window,  
Waiting for someone to sing me his song.  
So many dreams, I kept deep inside me,  
Alone in the dark, now you've come along.  
  
And you light up my life,  
You give me hope, to carry on.  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song.  
  
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the waters  
Could it be finally, I'm turning for home  
Finally a chance to say, "hey, I love you"  
Never again to be all alone.  
  
And you light up my life,  
You give me hope, to carry on.  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song.  
  
You, you light up my life  
You give me hope to carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
It can't be wrong, when it feels so right  
  
'Cause you, you light up my life

Bet you thought my world  
was over  
Bet you thought I'd crash and burn  
You thought I'd never  
Pick myself up off the floor  
But baby you were wrong  
Just like before  
  
[Chorus]  
I used to breathe you  
I used to need you  
I used to hang on every word  
that you say  
It used to please you  
To try to make me  
someone else  
And I thank you from  
My heart for your help  
Cause you made me find  
myself  
  
I used to think if I surrendered  
I'd be the perfect one for you  
But I swear I can't remember  
A single day of happiness with  
you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No I'm not going back in time  
And there's a price for being  
strong  
But I can live with who I am  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You made me find my dreams  
You made me find my love  
You made me find myself  
Thank you, thank you

I was blinded by the city lights  
LA livin' up the crazy life  
Lookin' back on how far I'd come  
Not quite sure what I was runnin' from  
  
A million miles away from the world I knew  
Who'd ever thought it'd lead me back to you  
  
[Chorus]  
You take me to front porch swings  
Mama singin "Cheatin' Heart"  
Yeah what a rush  
Catchin' lightnin' bugs in a mason jar  
  
You take me to county fairs  
Bedtime prayers  
Old wooden rockin' chairs  
And all the things I loved I thought were gone  
You take me home  
You take me home  
  
Took awhile to finally come around  
And separate all that was lost and found  
If there's one thing by now I better know  
The grass ain't greener where it doesn't grow  
  
I needed someone who would love me like you do  
To lead me back to the simple truth  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Summer heat  
Life's so sweet  
And dancin' on daddy's feet  
And all the things I loved I thought were gone  
You take me home  
You take me home  
You take me home

No one loves me better  
No one ever could  
I wish someone would have warned me  
That you would be so good  
  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Go on and take a bow  
I can't help loving how you've ruined me  
Yeah, you've ruined me  
  
Guess my hands are tied here  
How far do you want to take this  
If my mouth's done too much talking  
You should stop me with your kiss  
  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Go on and take a bow  
I can't help loving how you've ruined me  
Yeah, you've ruined me  
  
To me it's a revelation  
To you it's no surprise  
All the things that you do to me  
That make me come alive  
I could be the best thing  
That's ever happened to you  
Touch me, hold me, teach me, show me  
How to ruin you too  
  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Oh, you you you you've ruined me  
Go on and take a bow  
I can't help loving how you've ruined me  
Yeah, you've ruined me
