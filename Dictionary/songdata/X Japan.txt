Kizutsuke atta kotoba mo  
Kasaneta namida mo  
Itsuka wa omoide ni naru yo  
Dakara togireta melody  
Mune ni dakishimete ashita mo ikiru darou  
Anata ni aenakute mo  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my heart  
Falling through the rain  
  
I sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you hold my tears  
Cause still I love you  
  
I can't face that thought of being alone  
I sing for the song still carries on  
Mune ni dakishimete omoi wo utawasete  
Koe ni naranakute mo  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my pain  
There's nothing I can do  
  
I still have a longing for your memory  
Kizutsuku dake demo  
Kokoro wo tsutaetai yo  
  
Ima wa hitori ni shinai de  
Furi sosogu ame ni niware sou na yume  
Ashita mo kanaderu kara  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my heart  
Falling through the rain  
  
Sing without you  
I'll sing without you  
Can't you feel my heart  
Falling through the rain

Doko ni yukebaii anata to hanarete  
Ima wa sugisatta toki ni toi kakete  
Nagasugita yuru ni tobi dachi wo yume mita  
Ikoku no sora mitsumete kodoko wo dakishimete  
  
Nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete  
Owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Loneliness, your silent whisper  
Fills a river of tears through the night  
Memory, you never let me cry  
And you, you never said goodbye  
  
Sometimes our tears blinded the love  
We lost out dreams along the way  
But I never thought you'd trade your soul to the fates  
Never thought you'd leave me alone  
  
Time through the rain has set me free  
Sands of time will keep your memory  
Love everlasting fades away  
Alive within your beatless heart  
  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete  
Owaranai kanashimi wo aoi-bara ni kaete  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Nagareru namida wo toki no kaze ni kasanete  
Owaranai anata no toiki wo kanjite  
Dry your tears with love  
Dry your tears with love  
  
Dry your tears with love  
If you could have told me everything  
You would have found what love is  
If you could have told me what was on your mind  
I would have shown you the way  
Someday I'm gonna be older than you  
I've never thought beyond that time  
I've never imagined the pictures of that life  
For now I will try to live for you and for me  
I will try to live with love, with dreams  
And forever with tears

Oh! I'm looking at you  
Can't control myself  
Nothing, but pain for me  
  
Wipe your tears from your eyes  
Just leave and forget me  
No need to be hurt anymore  
  
Go away from me now  
I don't know what is love?  
No need to be hurt anymore  
  
You said, "I miss you so much  
Every night thinking of you  
And facing loneliness"  
  
But when you feel sadness  
Never can I stay with you  
  
I'm not the one you need  
Close your eyes and forget me  
There's nothing I can do anymore  
  
I lost my way  
I've been walking in the night of tears  
There I found someone was holding you  
As the night was falling down  
With my love also vanished my vision of you  
  
My heart is cold now  
Repeat  
You said, "I need you always  
Everyday thinking of you  
And living loneliness"  
  
Repeat  
Repeat  
Can't find my way

Tell me why  
Tell me why  
Tell me why the wind is so cold  
Take my heart inside your love  
Tell me why  
Tell me why  
Tell me why I feel so blue  
Tell me why  
Tell me why I love you  
My love for you would break my heart  
No No No  
No way to change my heart  
I still wanna be in the endless blue verse  
I feel so blue in this white poem  
Love will find the way  
This is the line you used to love  
Do you still believe that?  
While I'm away, read this line again
