I'm tired of being me,  
And I don't like what I see,  
I'm not who I appear to be  
So I start off every day,  
Down on my knees I will pray,  
For a change in any way  
But as the day goes by,  
I live through another lie,  
If it's any wonder why  
  
Am I ever gonna change  
Will I always stay the same  
If I say one thing,  
Then I do the other  
It's the same old song,  
That goes on forever  
Am I ever gonna change  
I'm the only one to blame  
When I think I'm right,  
I wind up wrong  
It's a futile fight,  
Gone on too long  
  
Please tell me if it's true,  
Am I too old to start anew,  
Cause that's what I want to do  
But time and time again,  
When I think I can,  
I fall short in the end  
So why do I even try,  
Will it matter when I die,  
Can anyone hear my cry?  
  
Am I ever gonna change  
Take it day by day  
My will is weak  
And my flesh too strong  
This peace I seek  
Till thy kingdom comes

Whoever said that big boys don't cry  
You say you never shed a tear  
Well, listen that's a lie  
We're all defenseless  
When it comes to pain  
I said boys and girls alike yeah,  
We're all the same  
  
It's my party  
I'll cry if I want to  
  
Big boys don't cry  
As if nothing seems to matter  
Big boys don't cry  
Then why do I  
Big boys don't cry  
Because nothing in this world  
Ever matters  
Big boys don't cry  
  
Hey, I'm not ashamed  
To say a tear  
Is in my eye  
Because another tear  
Will take its place  
Before I die

I had a dream,  
Last night I was blind  
And I couldn't see  
Color of any kind  
  
Picture the world, minus a rainbow  
When day becomes night, then where will the sun go  
Dancing alone, just me and my shadow  
Color me blind, so I can see no evil  
  
Why do we dream in black and white?  
Color me blind  
Why do we dream in black and white?  
Color me blind  
  
I had a dream,  
I was looking, over the mountain  
But I've, I've yet to see the,  
The so-called promised land  
  
Picture the world,  
Without any color  
You couldn't tell,  
One face from the other  
I don't understand  
Why we fight with our brother  
Color me blind  
Just to love one another  
  
Color me, color you,  
Color me blind

I'm paralyzed  
Process information  
At the speed of light  
I'm frozen  
In motion  
Desensitized  
Over stimulated matter  
Over mind  
Knowing I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I must confess  
Highly educated  
In my ignorance  
Not stupid  
Still lucid  
Indifferent  
Watching a world  
Amuse itself to death  
I'm muted  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
What? When?  
Why? Where?  
How come?  
Who cares?  
Knock, knock  
Who's there?  
No one  
How come?  
Who cares?  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
I have become  
Comfortably dumb  
Take me away  
So far away  
So far away  
Won't somebody  
Take me away  
Take  
Take it all away  

you read the papers today?  
  
I read the news today oh boy,  
About a tragic comedy  
Newspaper hinted suicide,  
The letterhead read dear johnny  
A tainted truth was all it said,  
Sleep tight now that  
You've made your bed  
An arrow that once pierced your heart  
Points to the apple on your head  
  
Three sides to every story  
Yours, mine  
And, Monday morning's  
  
Cupid's dead, headlines read,  
Cupid's dead  
Cupid's dead, headlines read,  
Cupid's dead  
  
Oh, romeo, oh, romeo  
Where did our love go, romeo?  
If you read between the headlines,  
You wouldn't be the last to know  
No mystery yet to unfold,  
A paperboy left in the cold  
A love was said to never die,  
Withered away and just got old  
  
'our top story tonight,  
Is a crime of passion  
The victim, an unidentified man,  
Is found in bed, wearing only a diaper,  
Holding a bow an arrow in one hand,  
And clutching a letter in the other.  
The letter simply read  
Cupid's dead.'  
  
Extra, extra, extra,  
Read all about it  
  
Cupid's dead,  
  
Cupid is dead, deceased,  
I got peace of mind  
Still it's hard to forget,  
What it leaves behind  
A lot of love lost,  
Your feelings are wasted,  
Tasted the sweetness,  
But now you're faced with,  
The thought, of being alone  
Nor more companionship,  
You can handle it,  
Just abandon it,  
Leave it behind,  
And look for the brighter day  
Give it some time,  
Cause it won't come right away  
You gotta be standing strong,  
Hold on to your dignity  
Don't sit around,  
Saying look what ya did to me  
It's time to move on,  
You gotta continue  
To look for a love,  
Of a life that's within you  
Cupid is dead now,  
It's time to rely on,  
Yourself to cope  
You got no shoulder to cry on  
Dead

Today don't look so bad, compared to tomorrow.  
If time is all we have, then we're living on borrowed.  
Yesterday's for fools who try to remember.  
The good old days weren't always that much better.  
  
Cynical.  
Well, I ain't nothing but a Cynical.  
It don't take much to be a Cynical.  
All you need is love.  
All you need is what to be a...  
  
And whatever you do, someone's done it first.  
Though it's sad but true, this is just another verse.  
If you can't take it with you, then what's the use?  
I never saw a you-haul being pulled behind a hearse.  
  
Looks like my brighter side has gotten a bit darker.  
I must have stepped over my 4-leaf clover.  
'cause someone drank my half-filled cup of water.

Now's not the time to say goodbye  
And I'm not the kind to question why  
Well I don't feel very well, and it's getting cold as hell  
It won't be the same, can't you tell?  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm so afraid  
Why can't you stay?  
Just don't leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong?  
  
Doing the things I should have known  
Only to reap what I have sown  
Jesus, please  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm on my knees  
Forgive me please  
Just don't leave me alone  
How long will my song be wrong?  
  
(keyboard solo)  
  
Don't leave me alone  
Don't leave me on my own  
I'm so afraid  
Why can't you stay?  
Just don't leave, don't leave... Me alone  
How long will my song... Be... Wrong?

Little lamb come out of the rain  
You'll catch your death in the cold  
A helping hand, come ease your pain  
In peace, you'll rest in our fold  
I can be a watch towering light  
For all those who can't see  
I'll separate the truth from the lies  
Blind faithful, come follow me  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist  
In what God you trust  
Close your eyes while I hypnotize  
A friend in need to confess  
You've been denied, the cock crowed thrice  
Surrender all you possess  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist  
I was betrayed by a kiss  
So many claim to come in thy name  
Promising peace they'll bring  
Lest you taste the fruit of the vine  
They're just wolves in sheep's clothing  
Evilangelist  
Your name is on my list  
Yeah, I'm your evilangelist  
In what God you trust  

Prentending to act so serene  
On your so called submissive knees  
A shopping list of begging pleas  
Adds to your complacencies  
As soon as the sun don't shine your way  
And you're saving it all up that rainy day  
It's a matter of time before you get down 'n' pray  
Fair weather faith - protect me from the storm  
Fair weather faith - gonna right all my wrongs  
Fair weather faith - you know I'm doing alright  
Fair weather faith - out of mind, out of sight  
Well I wonder if the man upstairs  
Will bother to lend an ear  
If you took the time to share  
Another one of your puppet prayers  
I ain't talkin' 'bout the weather  

"No Women Allowed!"  
Let me tell you about this love and hate relation  
Between a man and a woman  
And so none of you all get the wrong interpretation  
I can't live with them  
I'm gonna die without them  
  
Sooner or later  
You'll be a he man woman hater  
It's inevitable  
And to become one  
You've gotta really hate to love them  
He man woman hater  
He, he man woman hater  
You know I love to hate cause I hate to love them  
  
He man's behavior  
Doesn't need no explanation

He men have always had a sexual preoccupation  
It's gonna be your place or it's gonna be mine  
  
Sooner or later  
You'll be a he man woman hater  
It's inevitable  
And to become one  
You've gotta really hate to love them  
He man woman hater  
He, he man woman hater  
You know I love to hate cause I hate to love them  
He, he man woman hater  
Can't live with em gonna die without 'em

Help! I need somebody,  
Help! Not just anybody,  
Help! You know I need someone, help.  
  
When I was younger, so much younger than today,  
I never needed anybody's help in any way.  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,  
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors.  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around.  
Help me get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me.  
  
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways,  
My independence seems to vanish in the haze.  
But ev'ry now and then I feel so insecure,  
I know that I just need you like I've never done before.  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being around.  
Help me get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me.  
  
When I was younger, so much younger than today,  
I never needed anybody's help in any way.  
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured,  
Now I find I've changed my mind I've opened up the doors.  
  
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down  
And I do appreciate you being round.  
Help me, get my feet back on the ground,  
Won't you please, please help me, help me, help me, oh.

Oh yeah wooh  
Hey hey hey hey hey yeah  
  
Life's ambition occupy my time  
Priorities confuse the mind  
Happiness one step behind  
This inner peace I've yet to find  
  
Rivers flow into the sea  
Yet even the sea is not so full of me  
If I'm not blind why can't I see  
That a circle can't fit where a square should be  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a hole in my heart  
That can only be filled by you  
And this hole in my heart  
Can't be filled with the things I do  
  
Hole hearted [Repeat: x2]  
  
This heart of stone is where I hide  
These feet of clay kep warm inside  
Day by day less satisfied  
Not fade away before I die  
  
Rivers flow into the sea  
Yet even the sea is not so full of me  
If I'm not blind why can't I see  
That a circle can't fit where a square should be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a hole in my heart  
That can only be filled by you  
Should have known from the start  
I'd fall short with the things I do  
Hole hearted [Repeat: x6]  
Yeah

Don't just sit there and stare at me,  
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
I'm tired of what we are,  
I'm tired of all the pain,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
Faace lies flat,  
I see my reflection.  
Download thoughts,  
But your files are corrupted,  
Don't just sit there and stare at me,  
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
I'm tired of what we are,  
I'm tired of all the pain,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
Time stands still,  
And you're frozen in motion.  
Held down your escape,  
But you're crashing,  
You're crashing.  
Don't just sit there and stare at me,  
Don't just sit there and watch me bleed,  
I'm losing you, and you, you're losing me.  
I'm tired of what we are,  
I'm tired of all the pain,  
I'm losing you, we're losing...  

Everybody was born in it  
Sure as hell gonna die in it  
Some people don't give a shit  
Whether or not they're full of it  
  
It's on my mind most of the time  
That's when you find we all go blind  
Then it will start to get in our hearts  
It's gone too far, that's who we are  
  
It's a monster  
We all have within us  
It's a monster  
It's a monster  
Turns us into sinners  
It's a monster  
  
It started when I played with it  
It turned into a habit  
And after that once you've been bit  
You can't seem to get rid of it  
  
It's on my mind most of the time  
That's when you find we all go blind  
Then it will start to get in our hearts  
It's gone too far, that's who we are  
  
It's a monster  
We all have within us  
It's a monster  
It's a monster  
Turns us into sinners  
It's a monster

As stories go,  
This one's been told  
Another heart broken,  
Left out in the cold  
With one variation,  
The difference this time,  
This one is mine,  
Since you've been gone  
You've stolen my heart  
As for the rest of me  
I've fallen apart  
In my desperation  
My only prayer  
Handle with care  
'cause I don't know

It's worth everything  
Yeah my everything is you  
It's worth everything  
Yeah my everything is you  
It's worth everything  
Yeah my everything

It's not fair what they put me through  
Please tell me what am I supposed to do  
Why do I get myself in this situation  
  
There must be some logical  
Answers why I rob the cradle  
Can this be love or just infatuation  
  
Little girl come out and play  
I got some candy for my baby  
It's your sweet sixteenth birthday celebration  
  
Thank heaven for little girls who  
Grow up in a most peculiar way

(As you feel)  
Yeah, I might be crazy 'cause I like them so young  
(Little girls)  
But with little girls the best is yet to come come  
(Yet to come)  
  
Some they say I'm too old for her  
Old enough to be her father  
Incestual blood is thicker than water  
Do what's right not morally wrong  
Flesh and blood can only be so strong  
And it's my god not yours I'll have to answer

Look at monica walking in her sleep  
Look at monica running through the fields  
In her dream, so serene  
Monica, monica  
  
Hush, don't you say a word  
Did you see the smile she made today?  
  
Look at monica  
Look at monica  
  
Morning's coming ever so fast  
Shadow's reality's cast  
More like a dream that just won't last  
  
Look at monica walking in her sleep  
Look at monica running through the fields  
In her dream, so serene  
Monica, monica  
  
Please keep quiet, let her sleep  
Can't you see the smile she made today?

Saying I love you  
Is not the words I want to hear from you  
It's not that I want you  
Not to say, but if you only knew  
How easy it would be to show me how you feel  
More than words is all you have to do to make it real  
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me  
'Cause I'd already know  
What would you do if my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say if I took those words away  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying I love you  
  
More than words  
  
Now that I've tried to talk to you and make you understand  
All you have to do is close your eyes  
And just reach out your hands and touch me  
Hold me close don't ever let me go  
More than words is all I ever needed you to show  
Then you wouldn't have to say that you love me  
'Cause I'd already know  
  
What would you do if my heart was torn in two  
More than words to show you feel  
That your love for me is real  
What would you say if I took those words away  
Then you couldn't make things new  
Just by saying I love you  
  
More than words

Mutha, don't wanna go to school today  
I think I'd rather go outside and play  
  
They keep calling asking me  
If I'll come in  
Is that a sin  
If being lazy is the only reason  
  
It's getting late  
So, mutha don't you hesitate  
To pack my lunch  
And I'll be on my way to school  
  
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today  
I think I'd rather go outside and play  
  
Mutha, don't wanna go to school today  
I think I'd rather go outside and play  
  
The teacher's always looking down  
With her disappointed frown  
Asking me to go sleep somewhere else  
  
My levelheaded mutha  
Always said to one another  
That the truth will always hurt  
If you keep waiting  
I said waiting

So you want me to take it off  
Just to see what's  
Underneath my cloth  
I'll show you I'm every  
Inch a man  
Measure all that you  
Think you can  
  
I'm more than what  
Meets the eye  
Flesh 'n' blood is  
Often a white lie  
By the cover you misjudge  
The book  
Open your mind and take  
Another look  
  
[Chorus]  
Naked, and I'm unashamed  
Naked, with no one to blame  
Naked, ya you want the truth  
Naked, here's my birthday suit  
Naked, naked, naked, naked  
  
I pretend to be not anyone  
Except me and my imperfections  
There is nothing I  
Expect of you  
That you wouldn't  
Expect of me, too  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Will you excuse me for my ignorance  
'Cause I can see only one  
Difference  
Those of you who seek to find  
While all the others choose  
To walk 'n' talk blind

Never Been Funked  
I ain't trying to make no political statement  
I ain't trying to tell you the news of the world  
I ain't one to give intellectual realness  
I just want you to want me the way that I do  
  
Don't it make you feel good, make you feel good?  
Don't it make you feel good?  
  
[Chorus]  
You ain't never been funked like this before  
Never been funked, never been funked  
You ain't never been funked like this before  
  
I don't keep in touch with economical worries  
My interest don't lie in that same old story  
Communicating was never my problem  
I never have to talk to get through to you  
Talk,talk  
  
Do you really want to funk with me?  
Do you really want to funk with me?

Not really lookin' for, for nothing special,  
Just someplace that I can call my own,  
I'm growing tired of, of running wild,  
It's time I settled down  
Bridge:  
There seems to be some lights on,  
But ain't nobody home  
I think I see some lights on,  
But there ain't nobody home  
Ain't being choosy, but  
Don't want no floozy,  
And that's not much to ask  
  
Chorus:  
She's a nice place to visit (3x)  
But I wouldn't want to live her,  
Nice place to visit  
Hey, is anybody home?  
Seeing is believing,  
But looks can be deceiving,  
What you get ain't always what you see  
I like what' s down there,  
But no one is upstairs,  
I think there's bats in the belfry  
Chorus  
I don't know what's come over me,  
I'm blinded by the scenery,  
Nice place to visit,  
I don't know what I'm gonna do  
I'm coming back because of you,  
Nice place to visit, visit, visit...  
Bridge  
This big bad wolf knows  
Which way the wind blows,  
And which little piggy's house is made of brick,  
Must have vacated, or mislocated,  
There's just toys, toys in the attic  
Chorus (hey, is anybody home? )  
Knock, knock, who's there?  
She's a nice place to visit (2x)  

Respect  
Always everybody looking for some  
Respect  
Who do you think you're gonna get it from?  
Respect  
Anybody here deserving of none  
Respect  
So tell me, what makes you think you're not the one?  
  
No respect! No respect, none!  
No respect! No respect, none!  
No respect! No respect, none!  
No respect! No respect, none!  
  
Respect  
Why be concerned with public adulation?  
Respect  
Pat on the back, crying for attention  
Respect  
Finding out what it really means to be  
Respect  
Honor comes only after humility

Oh daddy, please  
Take me with you where you goin'?  
Oh daddy, please  
Come find the time, come watch us growin'  
Oh daddy, please  
Don't leave there's so much that we want to know before you go  
Well I'm in need of someone to tie my shoes  
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Oh daddy, please  
I pray every night the doors will open  
Oh daddy, please  
This house is just a broken home  
Left all alone  
Well I'm in need of someone to tie my shoes  
Or take hold of my hand when I become afraid  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Let me tell you 'bout  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Oh daddy, no  
Oh daddy, no  
Don't run away, yea  
And whose footsteps will I follow into  
Daddy please  
Don't you hear me  
Don't run away  
Our father  
Far father  
Lets talk 'bout  
Our father  
Yea, yea  
Far father  
Yea, I know what I'm talkin' 'bout  
Our father  
Far farther away  
Far father  

Heavy is the burden  
That brings you  
To your knees  
Lost in the confusion  
Of life's uncertainties  
Feel you're suffocating  
With every breath you take  
Moment left remaining  
Time for you to pray  
Time for you to pray  
  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
  
Whirl wind  
She's a-turning  
The river's  
On the rise  
Suddenly surrounded  
In the middle  
Middle of her eye  
Light precedes  
The thunder trembles  
Trembles and it shakes  
The ground your feet  
Are under  
Time for you to pray  
Time for you to pray  
  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace  
Pray for peace

Through the mountain of despair

Transform dark the yesterdays  
Into bright tomorrows  
With this faith  
We will be able to achieve this new day  
When all of the God's children  
Black men and White men  
Jews and Gentiles  
Protestants and Catholics  
Will be able to join hands  
And sing with the Negroes

Wars and rumors  
Of wars no one knows what for  
Toys and soldiers  
Deployed on some foreign shore  
Lords and rulers  
Destroy diplomatic rapport  
Communists, dictatorships  
Democracies, hypocrisies  
Ask not what your country can do  
To a one world governmental zoo?  
Political, political  
Politicalamity  
It's anarchy  
Political, political  
Politicalamity  
Rich and poor  
Salute your country's colors  
Less is more  
When one oppresses the other  
Pride and power  
Decorated upon collars  
Donkeys, bears and elephants  
All paper trained on parliament  
I said, "Ask not what your country can do  
To a one world governmental zoo?"

Well I say we got trouble, trouble, trouble  
Trouble, trouble, trouble, trouble  
We saw that was coming  
[Incomprehensible]  

Sex!  
  
Sex on the brain  
Pumped in my veins  
Flowing from my head to my feet  
Sex on TV  
Rotation heavy  
You and I are what we eat  
Sex when I'm all alone  
It calls me on the phone  
Can't stop this ringing in my ear  
Sex in excess  
Filling all our senses  
Keep saying there's nothing to fear  
  
Can't you read the writing on the wall  
Can't you see the rising and the fall  
  
All I see is porno-graffitti  
All I hear porno-graffiti  
See no, hear no  
All I speak porno-graffitti  
All I fear porno-graffitti  
Speak no evil  
  
Sex in 3d  
No evil eyes see  
Too much of it and you'll go blind  
Sex education  
Misinformation  
Kiss me where the sun don't shine  
Sex it surrounds me  
Porno-graffiti  
It's all so constitutional  
Sex is literate  
Read all about it  
But censor where you all can go  
  
Can't you read the writing on the wall  
Can't you see the rising and the fall  
  
All I see is porno-graffitti  
All I hear porno-graffitti  
See no, hear no  
All I speak porno-graffitti  
All I fear porno-graffitti  
Speak no evil  
  
Sex sells

She don't worry about tomorrow  
Nothing further from her mind  
She don't need to beg or borrow  
Time is on her side  
She like coloring the rainbow  
Never paint between the lines  
She like to chase away the shadow  
Watch them run and hide  
  
Kiss me in the morning  
Before I open up my eyes  
Would you kiss me in the morning  
Sunrise  
  
See her dancing on the water  
Washing dreams upon the shore  
Heaven wanting you to call her  
Knocking at your door  
She my center of attention  
Nothing further from my mind  
Point me in the right direction  
Sunshine shine your light  
  
Would you kiss me in the morning  
Before I open up my eyes  
Would you kiss me in the morning  
Sunrise alright  
  
Sunrise kiss and I will follow  
Sunrise shine your light  
Sunrise filling up my hollow  
Sunrise sunrise  
Sunrise kiss and I will follow  
Sunrise shine your light  
Sunrise filling up my hollow  
Sunrise sunrise sunrise  
She helped me find my way

My formal education  
Never bothered  
With my ABC's  
Teacher student relation  
Taught me all about  
The birds and bees  
  
School boy fantasy  
Lose control  
Of all my faculties  
  
You know that one thing  
That got through to me  
Was her body chemistry  
  
Subject to body language  
Ain't so bad to read  
Between the lines  
I scored above average  
Oral examination  
Is where I shine  
  
School boy fantasy  
Lose control  
Of all my faculties  
Student body graduated  
At the highest degree  
  
You know that one thing  
That got through to me  
Was her body chemistry  
Purely scientifically  
Studied her anatomy  
  
Teacher's pet, Teacher's pet  
God only knows what you do to me

Sun going up,  
Making its rounds  
It keeps on moving,  
Painting the town  
Before you know it,  
She's sinking low  
So tell me something . . .  
  
Something I don't already know  
I don't know?  
  
Toward the south,  
Then turning north  
Whirlwind spinning,  
On a circular course  
The answer my friend,  
Returns to blow  
So tell me something . . .  
  
Something I don't already know  
I don't know?  
Tell me something  
I don't know?  
  
As for the wise men who pursue  
Their knowledge  
Same as the fool, free falling  
Prey to folly  
Can only one fate befall  
Them both  
So tell me something . . .  
  
[Chorus:]  
If every song been sung,  
Under the sun  
What's left for me then,  
Eat drink and have fun  
It must go on, as for the show  
So tell me something . . .

So you're a self proclaimed messiah  
Or maybe a blasphemes liar  
A clever hypnotic hoax  
A hallowed heretic coax  
Who tells these stories so old  
No, never the same twice told  
Speaking in distorted truths  
I see that Thomas wants some proof  
Did you come to heal the sick  
With one more magician's trick  
Ye generation seeks a sign  
While blind keeps leading the blind  
  
So you say there is no god  
Just a clever man's charade  
A once upon a fairy tales fraud  
Has god made man or man made god  
  
There is no god  
Confused thy talk in parables  
Accused thou walk in parallels  
A simple game of Simon says  
This month's flavor sciences  
Today's fact, tomorrow's fiction  
Leave the rest to superstition  
If knowledge comes from learning books  
Wisdom comes from discerning looks  
A fool that says there is no god  
Don't feel for that sorry sod  
Who needs proof then he'll believe  
I wonder if he's been deceived  
  
There is no god

Flowers, I sent,  
Were found dead on their arrival  
The words, I said,  
Inserted foot in my mouthful  
So when, we dance,  
My lead it ain't so graceful  
(isn't so, not ain't so)  
  
I'm a hapless romantic  
St-t-tuttering p-poet  
Just call me a tragic comic  
Cause I'm, in, in love with you  
  
And when, we dine,  
I forget to push in your seat  
I wear, the wine,  
Spilling hearts all over my sleeve  
A stitch, in time,  
Proposing down on my knees  
(splitting between the seams)  
  
I'm a hapless romantic  
St-t-tuttering p-poet  
Just call me a tragic comic  
Cause I'm, in, in love with you  
  
Nobody, can know the,  
Trouble I've, seen  
Nobody, can know the,  
Trouble I, get into,  
When I'm with you

Hanging above the ground  
All my limbs are bound  
You're on the right hand  
With your head down  
Tears from eyes that cannot see  
He took the blame from me  
So shall it be written  
So shall it be done  
  
Watching, waiting  
Staring at the Son  
Not even knowing  
Who you are  
  
Three hours have gone by  
We start to question why  
Darkness falls in finding out  
Why you must die  
We can no longer see the Son  
The three untie into one  
Please forgive us Father  
We know not what we've done

New york city can be so pretty  
]from a bird's eye view  
Because up there  
Yeah, that's where I first kissed you  
A modern day romance  
A perfect performance  
Acting like two fools  
Saying silly things  
Whisper sweet nothings  
Live young lovers only do  
  
I was shaking  
You were breathtaking  
Like the empire state  
My voice was so far  
Not quite Sinatra  
Singing songs so great  
The clock struck one  
The night still very young  
In the city that never sleeps  
Then a whirlwind blew  
When I first kissed you  
Nearly swept me  
Swept me off my feet  
  
When I first kissed you  
That's when I knew  
I was in love  
  
Because up there  
Yeah, that's where  
I first kissed you

No one ever sees you cry  
You just keep it all inside  
In a warm place, where you can hide  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
I saw you laugh the other day  
But all too fast it went away  
  
Now your sky's cloudy 'n' gray  
Falling mainly on the plain  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
No water fallls  
Down your window pane  
  
And when I look into your eyes  
That window to your soul can't lie  
There's water where the well went dry  
  
So how long can there be a drought  
When your dam's filled with doubt  
No place to build your house  
Let your cup runneth over and out  
I said for crying out loud  
  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
No water fallls  
Down your window pane  
When will it rain  
When will it rain  
A tear for fear is calling out your name  
  
Rain on me

I don't know where I'm going  
But I do know where I've been  
I wonder if I'm growing  
Forever chasing wind  
I've got to keep on moving  
Destination still unknown  
The more I keep on looking  
The more I feel so alone  
  
Chorus:  
I never ask you where you're going, so don't ask me  
Where are you going?  
Not everybody knows where they're supposed to be  
Where are you going?  
So if you'll please point me in the right vicinity  
Where are you going?  
I never ask you where you're going, so don't ask me  
  
I'm not so good so far  
Fell off the beaten track  
'cause sometimes we go forward  
Must take two steps back  
  
Chorus  
(solo)  
Chorus

Tell me Jesus, are you angry?  
One more sheep has just gone astray  
A hardening of hearts turning to stone  
Wandering off so far from home  
  
So many children losing time  
Walk in darkness looking for a sign  
Chasing their rainbows, future looks so bright  
Slowly we're losing sight of the light  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
All alone out in the cold  
Can't look back, am I growing old?  
I chose a path and is this my fate?  
Am I finding out the truth too late?  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
Who cares, who cares, who cares?  
Tell me who cares, who cares?  
  
Here I am, a naked man  
Nothing to hide with empty hands  
Remember me, well I am the one  
Who lost his way your prodigal son?  
  
Can anybody, anybody?  
Anybody, any luck  
Anybody, any luck  
  
Am I ever gonna change?  
Will I always stay the same?  
I say one thing an' I do the other  
Same old song goes on forever  
Ever gonna change  
I just take it dead, I know  
My will is weak but my bless is strong  
Loose I seem to that yearn of gold

I've got something that you ought to know  
Don't even know whether to come or go  
Up down head's spinning around  
Wind up in the lost and found  
  
Wind me up, Wind me up  
Wind me up, Wind me up  
Wind me up, Wind me up  
  
Tell me why you make it so hard  
All I ask is finish what you start  
  
Wind me up, Wind me up  
Wind me up, Wind me up  
Wind me up, Wind me up  
  
Wind me up that's all you do  
Wind me up and leave me blue  
I'd like to see if you could be  
Kind enough to me when you  
Wind me up  
  
Don't take me places then want to go home  
Sometimes, I think I'm better off alone  
Hey girl, you know what you do  
Color me red then leave me blue
