I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you ain't seen what I've seen  
I can get a 100,000 in these Sean John jeans  
I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you ain't did what I did  
Where you from, you gotta get how you live  
  
Everybody already know jeezy real street nigga  
Every time you see me all around street niggaz  
I hope you got yours I keep mine  
In the club blowing dro throwing gang signs  
And you already know, dog  
745 back to back me and O dog  
These other niggaz is jokers  
What they rein up with I spent it up all the strokers  
  
In one night eight bitches sipped bottles of Cris  
Forty grand sit back so you can glance my wrist  
Keep bread so we carry dem toaster  
But keep back though my earrings ferocious  
It's not just my imagination  
I'm the one in the topic of your conversation  
Jack boyz say they gon rob  
But on the real fuck niggaz, y'all don't want these problems  
  
I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you ain't seen what I've seen  
I can get a 100,000 in these Sean John jeans  
I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you ain't did what I did  
Where you from, you gotta get how you live  
  
Black tees, black ones, and a fitted cap  
The Mack 11 make me walk wit a crazy dap  
Y'all say we country niggaz yee-haw  
The money comin back and forth like a seesaw  
And y'all ain't never seen what we saw  
Stacks of twenty dollar bills, bricks or white rolls  
What they got Lil Pha, they don't care 'bout shit  
Ludacris, how they ride out twenty wit dem bricks  
  
Shit, I spit it for y'all  
On the real my niggaz shit I spit it for y'all  
Who gives a fuck about friends?  
If you mix the baking soda wit it you can get a Benz  
While y'all robbing and boosting  
I'm standing over the stove like the chef in Houston  
And it's not about the flip mane  
Want the real bread it's all about your whip game  
  
I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you ain't seen what I've seen  
I can get a 100,000 in these Sean John jeans  
I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces  
And you ain't did what I did  
Where you from, you gotta get how you live  
  
I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces

I went from old school Chevys to drop top Porsches  
You couldn't walk a mile off in my air forces

You better holla at ya partners  
Before we catch them outside and hit they ass wit dem choppers  
The .45 make my pants sag  
Catch me bouncing through the club wit my black flag  
You don't like it do something nigga  
Where I'm from if we don't like it we do something nigga  
And you know we gon' ride homes  
Stomped a nigga ass out until they turn the lights on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Me and Jeezy on the back street  
Choppers in the back seat  
What we fin to do the questions yean even gotta ask me  
Desert in my lap and skullcap and a black tee  
Looking for the niggas that say they fin to attack me  
Turn the music down low and let the 'llac creep  
Fuck the police I give a damn if they catch me  
Wait a minute that's that nigga looking at me  
Let off 50 shots you niggas ran like a track meet  
I know my partners would have did the job for a flat fee  
But seeing dem niggas bleed is the only thing that's gon' relax me  
I'm hands on nigga damn what you say  
All them games that you play don't stand a chance in the A nigga  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Roll up on yo block  
All the bullshit stops  
Man hoe know that I'm the prince so that ass gon' drop  
I was born in the A with things in the way  
Smoke weed everyday  
Zone 3 where I stay  
Yeah I think I'm the shit cause I got an SS  
But the shit a old folk so you can receive the letter  
I'm the best of the best  
And the freshest of the fresh  
Gotta pistol black out wit an Atlanta Hawk vest  
Gotta lifetime of trouble and my brain still nervous  
I don't rep the A by mistake I do the shit on purpose  
Do it how it's worth it rim and the cars swerving  
It ain't nothing but Lil Scrappy and g's up to start murkinin' ya

Four shots to the chest, my niggas get at me  
They don' fucked around and fucked up my new white tee  
I'm just livin' my life, why they mad at me  
Woke up this morning, I ain't see this coming  
Should I even bust back, you ain't see me running  
I hope heaven got a VIP line  
Got some partners in hell that'll sneak me in the back door  
You know I hate waitin' in line  
  
Paramedics on the way, but they wastin' they time  
Everybody standin' over a nigga, screamin'and shit  
Damn, ya'll give a nigga a second to think  
Which one of you niggas shot me, it was one of you bastards  
Let my nigga Kink throw a hundred grand in my casket  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
Pour out a little liquor, bury me in some Evisu jeans  
A USDA top and a throw-away glock  
Bury me a G, nothin more nothin less  
When I get where I'm goin, I just gotta be fresh  
  
Expect the worst, but hope for the best  
But you know how it is, amen god bless  
I can't leave now niggas owe me money  
My nigga on the westside owe me bout a dub  
And my partner with a few, shit he owe a nigga too  
  
I should'a hugged my son, should'a kissed my mother  
Spent some time with her, show her I love her  
Every night she was prayin for me, I was in the streets  
Active little nigga, should I stay in some beef  
Gucci go through some shit and he really need me  
And what about the streets, shit they need me too  
I'm on some got Def Jam, shit they owe a nigga too  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
[News report]  
We interruped our program to bring you this breaking news story,  
I'm Kelly Washington reporting for WKKT Cannel 7  
Witnesses say that around 1.45 this morning shots were fired out of an atlanta
nightclub rapper Young  
Jeezy was involved in this shooting but at this time it is unclear wether he
was a suspect or the victim  
We'll bring you further details as they become available  
  
Back to you [Repeat: x 2]  
  
[Young Jeezy]  
I was on my way I was almost gone  
I was almost there I was almost home  
It was some Kanye shit tryna touch the sky  
Jesus walks god testify  
I'm a legend like John we're ordinary people  
You only get one life there's no sequel  
So you can't take nothing for granted  
And don't take granted for nothing  
  
So I gotta thank god for waking me up this morning  
And giving me this air to breath  
Jesus lord forgive me for  
Every Gram I sold  
Every glock I popped  
Every rock that i...  
  
[Chorus: x 4]

Yeah

[Chorus]  
I said I'm young by the way

The truth by the way  
The proof by the way

And You can call me

I did it by the way  
I was with it by the way  
I talk it like I did it  
Cause I lived it by the way  
  
[Verse 1]  
Young, the boy might go nuts  
Holes in niggas just like donuts  
Creme be crispy these niggas cant hear me  
Must be the wrong size  
Cause these niggas cant fit me  
Never let em play me  
Never let em bullshit me  
If they ever bullshit me  
Send the coroner to get me  
And when the coroner come to get me  
I'ma take you pussy's with me  
And I ain't trustin' 12 shots  
No I keep them choppers with me  
And I don't trust you from a ??  
Gotta keep them shottas with me  
Cant let the goons get bored  
Gotta keep them niggas busy  
And I ain't trustin' nobody  
So I took my money with  
Cause last time they got me, get me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 2]  
Stay on it by the way  
I want it by the way  
Take it to your mommas momma house  
Where everybody stay  
Where everybody sleep  
Leave everybody sleep  
Have a baby by who  
Thats everybody freak  
Baby like a dry cleaner  
Seen everybody's sheets  
Take em straight to the hood  
Then everybody eat  
They went down, I went down  
Now everybody cheap  
Or should I say cheaper  
Or maybe ever lower  
You niggas gettin' this shit  
Should I talk any slower  
Any slower it be screwed  
And that would be rude  
I'm a man no respect  
And Plus I got a sack  
Got the west side crackin'  
Ask about 'em in the trap  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
Turned a brick into a clothing line a boost commercial  
And he's still talkin' yo "so who's commercial?"  
Young like Noah move them birds by the two  
Daddy need to smoke the coupe need a pair of shoes  
Got my A.R. on 'em still wont cross over  
I gotta half a box left think I need more soda  
Still rain man sosa,  
Just brought this thing in its too big for a holster  
They say I'm bipolar, so indecisive  
So motherfucking what, I know some bitches that like it  
The real niggas recite it, the real bitches they love it  
Its just he way that I strut it, they just like I want 'em so fuck it  
  
[Chorus]

See I'm a' start off so slow yeah I said so slow  
They love me out in D.C. just like gogo  
I said gogo yeah I said gogo  
See them right with Don Cannon it's a gogo  
See I want my song like Cocoa  
I like to heat mine up like Cocoa  
See dem eight seven Jeans see the logo  
Every time a day, count em' baby gogo  
  
You know how the drop be everything slow  
You know how the drop be anything goes  
Remember back then when I got the snow low  
And I was in and out of state just like Romo  
  
Lookin' out for them boys no homo  
Can't tell em what your drivin' that a no no  
I'm gonna tell you this but keep it on the low low  
If it's number two then we might be the popo  
  
Things are gettin' higher  
Makes it hard on the buyers  
Sun is all around  
Sun rise  
Sun rise  
  
Push up till we grind  
  
Rent bein' paid late

I'm here now you old news  
Got a couple old porches, couple old schools  
I'll line ya ass up push ya tape backwards  
'Cause I'm a real nigger I don't like rappers  
  
And that ain't this and this ain't that  
And bitch I'm strapped  
Fuck wit real nigger that'll cut ya throat  
And they don't drink Pepsi they just sell Coke  
  
All I do is talk dro its like my brain on drugs  
See me out nigger I do my thing in clubs  
Listen up Jeezy gotta a little riddle  
Stack of 20-dollar bill two bands in the middle  
  
[Chorus]  
All the gangstas they gon ride to this  
They goin' grind to this  
They goin' shine to this  
This is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, this is gangsta music, and  
this is gangsta music  
All the hustlers they goin' ride to this  
They goin' grind to this  
They goin' shine to this  
This is hustler music, this is hustler music, this is hustler music, and  
this is hustler music  
  
We don't talk on the phone 'cause it might stick  
Gotta play for the 7 call it Mike Vick  
Dirty birds nigger we play wit them falcons  
Know some niggers in the Decatur that pay for them falcons  
  
Talking young hungry niggers eat ya whole plate  
Jeezy place the order niggers eat ya whole face  
You got me Mr. Scrooge all fucked up  
Jump out hit the switch light ya ass up  
  
Carbon 15 wit the one pound drum  
Got plenty for any nigga think he wants some  
We don't leave 'em at the house we bring 'em out  
My chain for yo life we can swap it out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The hoes love my voice  
Make they pussy moist  
Certified g shit and I'm the gangster's choice  
Niggers popping off hope they bullet proof  
  
Leave holes inside ya like a sunroof  
Mack 11 in the club and a sub nose  
Swear to God knock you niggers out ya clothes  
Lay ya ass flat like a doormat  
  
Niggers ask for but they don't want that  
In the rap game takin' niggers clientele  
White ones like the powder that I used to sell  
Give a fuck about a player hater  
Hit 'em wit the tool bust his whole radiator

Cause I get allot of that(I get allot of that)  
Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that(if you get a lot of that) I
get allot of that  
Put your hands in the air if you get allot of that  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Let's talk about hate cause I get allot of that  
Talk about money cause I get allot of that  
(I get allot of that, I get allot of that, I get allot of that,)  
Cause I get allot of that  
  
This can't be it man this shit is stress full  
Is that what it is I'm just successful,  
Maybe I'm to good to hood low down no good  
I just keep shit real just like you should,  
Twist my fingers throw up my hood  
Let's get this money I know I would  
I know that's right but still we do wrong  
J-bo got 30 but still we moved on  
Get them clamps out  
Get my groove on  
I stay iced out  
Get my cool on  
Best be cool homes  
Get my goon on  
I'll bust them to homes  
Get my lose on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They say young fell off yeah the boy done lost it  
Been porting all my life baby I'm just exhausted  
I take a Gatorade break to get everything straight  
Now I'm sitting here like how much Gatorade make  
How much money would it take to make some mo money  
Damn right a nigga straight come get some mo from me  
I sold millions made them millions  
But still yaw doubt me what's this with out me  
Can't be that bad still got my trap swag  
And every time I do a show I leave with a trap bag  
Money in trash bags  
I call that garbage  
20 thousand a trash bag  
It looks like garbage  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I get allot of that allot of this  
I need allot of it  
Sit on my bedroom floor counting all of it  
That money be Ludacris  
It just might shock you  
If you can't find Chaka then my right hands keep it  
Look I am simply on of the best  
Can't even lie i can't vouch for the depressed  
Just like zip-lock they get killed in the plastic  
Best add five grams so you can weigh it in plastic  
I am so dirty they wrap me in plastic  
When they wrap me in plastic need to put me in traffic  
They say that I'm difficult even different  
Show me the difference I'll bring you the difference  
  
[Chorus]

I do this shit!  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Them bricks wrapped up, and I'm strapped up (Yuh!)  
Nigga act up! Get capped up! (Brat!!)  
See this big toy? Play if you wanna nigga  
Head over here, you just around the corner nigga (Woo!)  
I'm a heavy-weight, never boxed one round (Nah!)  
In and outta state, never lost one pound  
Nigga I'm crazy straight (Gyeah!), I flip crazy weight (Aaaye)  
Now I flip tha mic', and that's crazy riiight?  
((Trap or Die) nigga!) That's my favorite tune  
I'm always in tha kitchen, that's my favorite room (Hahaaa)  
And I'm bakin' mine, call me Duncan Hines  
Ran through a hundred grand, call it a waste of time  
I do this shit!  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

(Ay, ay, ay, ay)  
  
New shoes on the range rover, good one man (vroom)  
Motherfuckers acting like I ain't supposed to shine  
I ain't the one, definitely not the two (nope)  
One in the chamber when we aiming at you  
The young Bob Barker, the price is right  
If you C.O.D. then you could get them tonight  
Put the fish scale on the scale  
If Roy went postal, all he do is check mail (ha ha)  
Low key, under the radar  
Triple black 'Vet, yeah I call it the stealth  
No currency machine, I could count it myself  
Almost done, another quarter million in ones  
Thunder storm in the body-tap, look what I've done  
Chump change, I make it rain for fun (whats up)  
  
Snow man, get cha' hands up high  
It's ya' boy, Mr. 17-5  
I take it back to the block, back to the kitchen, back to the pots  
Snow man, get cha' hands up high  
It's ya' boy, Mr. 17-5  
I take it back to the block, back to the kitchen, back to the pots  
  
I get them bars out of the back of my mind (that's how)  
I reminisce like Mary J  
Even in the drought, the boy kept that yay  
100 percent served, Snowman's word  
You can play my thug and my clientele (why)  
I'm addicted to that new car smell  
White cookies in a plastic bag  
New shoes on the coupe with the paper tag  
Whole life flash right before your eyes  
See the state troopers and get butterflies  
Got a thing for them Heckler and Koches  
A minute 14 and Rolex watches  
Somewhere in the back of my secret deranged brain  
I get a rush when I tote that 'cane  
Get money, Nigga fuck them haters  
All we fear is the discovery and inditement papers (whats up)  
  
Snow man, get cha' hands up high  
It's ya' boy, Mr. 17-5  
I take it back to the block, back to the kitchen, back to the pots  
Snow man, get cha' hands up high  
It's ya' boy, Mr. 17-5  
I take it back to the block, back to the kitchen, back to the pots  
  
I'm a grown ass man, I stand on my own two  
200,000 cash, yeah, I'm buying my own team  
Right to your front door, operation so sweet  
I like little dude who keeps his money so neat  
But I still bury a nigga  
Put The Mask on, Jim Carey a nigga (Blaou)  
Swede ends in the Chevy, got me feelin' awkward  
Careful with the sweets, don't burn my seats  
You could live your whole life and not come close  
Guess that's why these rap niggas take notes  
Recite my adlibs, borrow my quotes  
Make me I hop a nigga, serve them with the toast  
Next, they be dressing like me  
But back in '93, they wasn't stressing like me (whats up)  
  
Snow man, get cha' hands up high  
It's ya' boy, Mr. 17-5  
I take it back to the block, back to the kitchen, back to the pots  
Snow man, get cha' hands up high  
It's ya' boy, Mr. 17-5  
I take it back to the block, back to the kitchen, back to the pots

[Chorus]  
Man them young niggas killing bout nothing  
Show up at the spot with the choppers like nothin'  
Full fifty shots, clear the block like nothin'  
If you made it from the bottom to the top like nothing  
You don't owe a nigga nothing  
Nothing, nothing, nothing,  
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing  
You don't owe a nigga nothing  
Nothing, nothing, nothing  
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing  
You don't owe a nigga  
  
Put your cups in the air, I'd like to make a toast  
In case it goes down, yeah you know I got my toast  
And when you really from the streets that's when they hate you most  
And when you really got it then that's when they hate you close  
Knew him back in the day when we was gettin money  
Now every time I see the nigga he be actin funny  
Don't you niggas see it? I'm a little pressed for time  
Wanna talk about the past, told 'em press rewind  
And I ain't feelin what you sayin ho, you out of place  
I have you feeling what I'm sprayin' yeah it's on my waist  
I'm trying to chill, smoke a couple with my lady friend  
So they can meet me at the telly in the latest Benz  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nigga you see me getting mine, you better get yours  
Are you the one doing the serving or you gettin served?  
Or you the one doing the jackin, or you gettin jacked  
Or you the one that's goin hard or you fallin' back  
And I don't believe in falling back, bitch I'm goin hard  
They wanna see me fucked up, man I swear to God  
They praying that I fail, I'm praying that I rise  
I guess the hating didn't work so now they tellin lies  
Oh he ain't did this, and he ain't did that  
Boy keep it real wit ya self, you know he lived that  
You ain't real, you don't give em what they asking for  
Such a real nigga, what the fuck you askin' fo'  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And you don't even know a nigga, what you hating for?  
And I ain't going nowhere so what you waiting for?  
Beat the street, this rap shit cake and ice cream  
Fuck the selling words, bitch I sold ice cream  
From the bottom to the top, that's a nice dream  
How you make it out young? I had a nice scheme  
And I don't owe a nigga shit, better get it right  
Just know a nigga stayed down each and every night  
Hands on, yeah I broke down my own things  
Hands on, yeah I counted up my own chains  
Fifties over here, twenties over there  
You know the rest, nigga, fives and singles everywhere  
  
[Chorus]

I put on, I put on, I put on, I put on  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
  
When they see me off in traffic, they say "Jeezy on some other shit"  
Send them pussy niggas runnin' straight back to the dealership  
Me I'm in my spaceship, thats right I work for N.a.s.a  
This 7H is not a fraud, call that bitch my bodyguard  
Call that bitch your bodyguard? Yeah, that's my bodyguard  
Wear a lot of jewelry, Young don't do security  
What's whiter than a napkin, harder than a dinner plate  
If you want it come and get it, you know I stay super straight  
Ran up in my spots and now I'm workin' Out the Super 8  
Know you niggas hungry, come and get a super plate  
Y'all sing happy birthday, yeah I got that super cake  
Hundred karat bracelet, I use it like some super bait  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
I put on for my city, on on for my city  
Put on (east side) Put on (south side) Put on (west side) Put on  
  
[Verse 2: Young Jeezy]  
Half bag, top back,  
Ain't nothin' but a young thug  
HKs, AK's, I need to join a gun club  
Big wheels, big straps,  
You know I like it super sized  
Passenger's a red-bone,  
Her Weave look like some curly fries  
Inside fish sticks, outside tartar sauce  
Pocket full of celery,  
Imagine what she tellin' me  
Blowin' on asparagus,  
The realest shit I ever smoked  
Ridin' to that Trap or Die,  
The realest shit I ever wrote  
They know I got that broccoli,  
So I keep that glock on me  
Don't get caught without one,  
Comin' from where I'm from  
Call me Jeezy Hamilton,  
Flyin' down Campbellton  
So fresh, so clean,  
On my way to Charlene  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I put on, I put on, I put on  
I put on for my city, I put on for my  
I put on for my city, I put on for my city, on  
  
I feel like there's still niggas that owe me checks  
I feel like there's still bitches that owe me sex  
I feel like this but niggas don't know the stress  
I lost the only girl in the world that know me best  
I got the money and the fame and that don't mean shit  
I got the Jesus on a chain, man that don't mean shit  
Cause when the Jesus pieces can't bring me peace  
Sure I need just at least one of Russell's nieces on  
I let my nightmares go I put on,  
Everybody that I knew from the go  
I know hoes that was frontin' when they knew he was broke  
They say damn, Yeezy Yeezy, you don't know us no more  
You got that big fame homie, and you just changed on me  
You can ask big homie, man the top so lonely  
I ain't lyin', so lonely I ain't lyin'  
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)  
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)  
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)  
Cause every night (every night) I put on  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Let me see what we have tonight (what we have tonight)  
I'm high as a satellite (satellite)  
I see those flashin' lights (flashin' lights)  
Cause every night (every night)  
Let me see what we have tonight  
I'm high as a satellite  
I see those flashin' lights

R.I.P we just killed the club  
Drank patron out the bottle almost killed a thug  
Right now I'm so high I can't feel the drugs  
Too many haters in here, I don't feel the love  
R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club  
Took patron to the head almost killed a thug  
  
I'm in a brand new drop top 'Rari with three bitches  
Tired being in the middle of trial with three snitches  
And I hit up every club in your city, where niggas at?  
I be in every club in the hood, where niggas at?  
Pull up, jump out stuntin like I was Baby  
On my cocaine cowboy shit, like in the 80's  
Who the nigga think he is Slick Rick or Dana Dane  
Think he Rakim or somethin, look at his chain  
Myself, from head to toe, I'm Dougie Fresh  
Looking like I came to play, Mitchell and Ness  
Any nigga with a watch like that, he need attention  
Your man don't ball out like that, you need to bench him  
  
R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club

Pockets on extra big, they on Samoan  
Got some bad bitches all in my section, just let some more in  
And every nigga came in with me'll kick your door in  
Roll up, pass it around like we Jamaican  
Whole pounds strapped up in this bitch like we some Hatians  
She got good head, good brains, good education  
I'm drunker than a motherfucker, here's the situation: 1:45 am, the nights
broken  
By the time a nigga get to the crib, the mall open  
Man the nerve of this high-ass bitch, she on the molly  
She said she she want me to call her Ms. Berry, she think she Halle  
  
R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club  
Took patron to the head almost killed a thug  
R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club  
Took patron to the head almost killed a thug  
  
Got a pocket full of Dead Prez  
Attached to your girl like a .jpeg  
Party scene turn to a murder scene  
Keep shittin on niggas, need potty train, turn up, collard green  
I'm on gasoline and I'm on that promethazine  
Life ain't nothin but a G thing  
Switch lanes, get brain, hand down her g-string  
I'm the type of nigga thats built to last  
You fuck with me, Ill put my foot in your ass  
I got a million in stash, I stack my money so tall  
That you might need a giraffe  
When you was countin this cash, nigga!  
  
R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P., R.I.P we just killed the club

Like the person needs his soul "uh huh, jeah"  
Fight the will "ay" to need his own "ay, ay, ay"  
"Just talk to em for a minute, ay just talk to em for a minute"  
Like the baby "ay" needs to cry "uh huh jeah"  
If you go "ay" I swear "jeah" ill die "ay, ay, ay"  
  
How the fuck I'm free out here and you locked in there  
Your whole family acts like I ont care  
They don't know about the nights I just lay in my bed  
I can't even sleep I just lay in my bed  
Eyes full of tears and a heart full of pain  
Take deep breathes every time I hear your name  
You was more than family you was like my brother  
So when the shit went down its like I lost my brother "ay"  
And I wish we could trade places  
Swear to GOD dawg wish we could trade places  
Livin' a life of crime, but it wasn't your life it was more like mine  
I often think about the close calls we had  
And I often think about the close brawls we had  
And I love my nigga what you know bout that  
And ill do anything to get goalmouth back talk to em  
  
Like the person needs his soul  
Fight the will to need his own  
"Make em understand, hey, please, make em understand"  
Like the baby "please, look, ay"  
Needs to cry "make em understand, ay, ay, ay"  
If you go I swear ill die  
"make em understand, jeah, ay, talk to em ay, ay, ay"  
  
Mel man you my heart I swear to god "swear to god"  
Knew you was real man I saw it from the start "from the start"  
Even when I was wrong my nigga had my back "yeah"  
Even when I was right my nigga had my back "damn right"  
We used to laugh wouldn't shit funny "naw"  
Late night at my grandma house counting money  
I trust you with my life dog if I was married id trust you with my wife dog  
Any given time a half a mill in your possession  
You ain't called in two days man I still wasn't stressing "naw  
Cause when I talk my nigga listen "listened"  
Switch shit you used to help me with them pigeons  
"Earnest" Earnest T. won't talk to me dog and it hurts "it hurts"  
She treats a nigga like I'm the scum of the life "scum of the earth"  
In your eyes I couldn't do no wrong "naw" so to you I dedicate this song "talk
to em"  
  
Like the person "ay" needs his soul "ay"  
Fight the will "talk to em for me my nigga" to need his own  
"gotta feel me on this one, jeah, ay, talk to em in tongues nigga,  
Do it make these niggas understand"  
Like the baby "ay" needs to "I love you Mat Lou"  
Cry "uh huh, talk to em"  
If you go "I don't think they understand me my nigga"  
I swear ill die "jeah, talk to em, ay, ay, ay"  
  
Must've bust ten rounds through the strap in your lap  
Knew I was a gangsta I wasn't going for that  
Pussy nigga in my yard talkin' shit  
Knowin' damn well I was on some G shit  
Let the whole clip ride and didn't think  
Let the whole clip ride and didn't blink  
You told me kindly not to bring the white in your house  
And then what I do bring the white in the house  
Bricks in the addict and yean know  
Your grandson killin' em he getting 24  
Feds at the door I'm out of town  
Yean tell 'em shit, you held me down  
Now a-days I rock the mic I'm getting paid for that  
And all the shit I been through I'm getting paid for that  
Always said I would make, wish you could see me now  
But if I tried to tell her she probably wouldn't believe me now

Whats up?  
Ha ha  
Yeah! Yes! It's real talk, can I talk to y'all for a minute?  
I was in the streets the other day,  
I had a homie come through and he ask me  
Say "Yo! Everybody listen to you,  
Everybody all ears, what you gonna do to give back?"  
I told him "Look homie, I'm ten steps ahead of you, if not thirty"  
Real talk, listen up, I got one song, let's make it right, let's go  
  
I'm high on life and a fifth of Remy  
From the city where them young niggas die skinny  
Keep work on deck if you need any  
Just holler at them boys cause they keep plenty, follow me!  
Got the weight of the world on my shoulders  
And I swear it feels like ten thousand boulders  
And it's so heavy, but I'm so ready  
Feels like I was born for this  
If not, at least I'll die for it  
They said I couldn't do it but I'll still try for it  
The big question is what can I do for the youth?  
Everybody lyin to 'em so I told 'em the truth  
  
[Chorus]  
"I'm a hustler!" So, one man, one stage, one mic  
One song, one chance to get it right  
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night  
And I think I know the way, follow me  
"I got hustle!" One man, one stage, one mic  
One song, one chance to get it right  
I really thank y'all, we gon' see the night  
And I think I know the way, follow me  
"I'm a hustler!"  
  
Real niggas don't die, they go to the Feds  
Fresh out, right back chasin' bread  
My life's so hard, so concrete  
I was raised by 'em homie, that's why I think so street  
Take me for instance  
My life is not about you, think me for instance  
I did the impossible, I made it out  
Got dealt a bad hand but I played it out  
I'm a left lane nigga, my life's so fast  
Now I'm thinking holmes, got my right blinker on  
Spread my word, got my Kirk Franklin on  
Stuntin' in traffic like "This my car"  
Sometimes I wonder how I made it this far  
Life's a bitch so I'm tryna wife her  
Just ball around, you know, buy her some things  
Lovin' every minute of it, still breakin' chains  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Y'all my brush, let me paint a perfect picture  
Gotta pay attention cause it's three dimensional  
Same picture, see it one of three ways  
Let it marinate, it might take a few days  
They say all I talk about is drugs and violence  
So I shouldn't say nothin' Get a moment of silence  
If it don't make dollars, it don't make sense  
Words to live by, took it out of context  
They say your pass is your present and your present is your cash  
So I look forward to the future  
Get a lil' paper your baby momma won't have  
Part of the college so I need a forecast  
Where's the weatherman at when you need him?  
A hungry nigga eat anything you feed him  
A rich nigga will buy anything you sell him  
And a broke nigga believe anything you fuckin' tell him  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
I'm blowin' good yeah I smoke it by the song,  
And when them niggas call I don't pick up my phone  
Niggas acting like broads make me pick up my tone,  
I had a lil' time so I wrote a lil' song.  
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas  
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, fuck niggas  
Yeah this one's for you fuck niggas, fuck niggas  
Yeah I'm talkin' bout them fuck niggas, them fuck niggas  
Yeah this one's for you  
  
I'm high as Southwest, Jizzle when your flight land,  
I don't know bitch I might fly to england  
Hit the highway with the change, yeah the change man  
I dun it my way with them thangs, changed the game plan  
Had these niggas tellin' lies, they just sound true  
Nigga if you had it like that I would've found you  
I'm tryna cash out a hundred let me get a buck  
Bitch they'll be just like you nigga fake as fuck  
Get em home and they probably all sheet rock  
They sellin' bullshit fuckin' up the street stock  
You living mine and yours thats a double dip  
That synthetic ass shit we call it double whip  
And nigga nothing beat the cross but the double cross  
I ran the streets and rap bitch I'mma double boss  
Them niggas cashed out one I sent a double off  
They knocked him off halfway I took a double loss  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's put these niggas on the stand, now stand up and be a man  
Raise your hand and swear you weren't my number one fan  
And I'm still that same nigga, you still that same nigga  
But at the same time, I'm starting to get bad vibes  
What I owe you sumthin' nigga, that's what you act like  
I ain't like them other niggas boy, you betta act right  
The first few years of your deal ride your training wheels  
And then you graduate and live how real niggas live  
And I ain't dissin', naw, I ain't dissin'  
But when you sit back and listen, this what the rap game's is missin'  
I'm used to thug niggas, it's too many young niggas with.  
Too much of liquor, too many drugs in em, too many clicks, too much swag
nigga,  
Too many niggas wearing tight shirts and skinnies, walking round with they ass
out  
Y'all betta cash out, gon' put your cash up  
Because I'm all in and if I don't win nigga, I'mma mask up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hardest part of life niggas cant play they role  
Everybody wanna ride the train, don't wanna pay the toll  
Keep it going young, boy you on a role  
Hoe nigga magazine, you the centerfold  
You can check the resume, nigga I'm good as gold  
Lawn chair ass niggas all they do is fold  
Nigga you talkin' with emotions, you emotional  
You might can get a lil' light, feelin promotional  
Tell me what cha see when you lookin' in the mirror  
Look as this hoe as nigga, I couldn't said it clearer  
And you the same nigga that started up this jewelry game  
And when you see him nowadays the nigga jewelry lame  
Ain't got it by now, nigga you ain't got it  
And why you talkin' like that cause bitch you ain't bout it  
And nigga how ya doin' now, worst then before  
And bitch we winning over here, I've been keeping score.  
  
[Chorus]

Ay, ay, check out the man, check out the man,  
Ay, ay, check out the man check out the man

Yo, they still be grindin', and runnin'  
Tryin' to get into somethin' or nothin'  
I remember them days, when the block got hot, bullets flyin' for the what  
It was, like, you ain't, really give a fuck  
I'm a sister, mother, I'm your daughter, I'm your lover and I'm  
Right here, and I'm sayin' that it's whack sauce

Look at me what you see? A fool and his foolish ride  
Y'all know damn well I wasn't lettin' you niggas down  
Just to sit back and watch you led by these fuckin' clowns  
Four albums in, niggas still talking this real shit  
Three classics in nigga, and that's on some real shit

Been through straight hell so I can get street heaven  
Bitch I'm Jeezy, the one you've been waiting for  
And them forges is off-set, don't they look like they skatin' hoe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bitch I was born high, and that's how I'm dying nigga  
Eyes Wide shut with my finger on the cold trigger  
Be hearing my word, now don't it sound like my soul bleeding  
Hearing my word, now don't it sound like my soul reading  
I do it for street niggas and every nigga that's like you  
Let's see if you can afford one, even niggas that buy two  
Can't believe what I'm hearing, can't believe what ya saying  
All that I did, god damn, this how you try to play me  
Feeling my words when I be talking that street talk  
No, you be feeling my words when I be talking that street smart  
Yeah, school of Hard Knocks, yeah bitch I graduated  
Straight to them hard blocks and nothing was barricaded  
  
[Chorus]

What the fuck am I doing  
Wake up in the morning who the fuck am I screwing  
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white  
You know its going down, I can do this all night  
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters  
Money over bitches two times for the fakers  
'Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright  
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life  
  
Look, yeah, I said g-g-go DJ  
See you got the Jizzle on replay  
Just keep that Jizzle on repeat  
It's about the time everybody screams "Free Meech!"  
Let's take your bitch ass back to o five,  
Close your eyes, take a rough nigga look, Atlanta lights  
Club vision, PJ in my hand, I'm on the couch  
Man this nigga Meech just blew a quarter mil, he bought a house  
Man you niggas gonna lace up your sneaks? It's time to ball  
Presidential at the Swiss Hotel, makin' come alls  
Posted up, all black in the back, a hundred deep  
A hundred coupes posted up in the front, two-hundred seats  
Man somebody call the IRS, too many lambos  
I'm talking bottles and blunts, all you can handle  
Them other niggas fakin and flaugin'  
Man them real niggas do real things, let's drink to that!  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm way too gone, what the fuck am I doing  
Wake up in the morning, who the fuck am I screwing  
My partner on brown and you know I'm on white  
You know its going down, I can do this all night  
Gotta get to the paper one time for the haters  
Money over bitches two times for the fakers  
'Cause even in the dark, baby I'mma shine bright  
I'm way too gone, the best night of my life  
  
I said I'm gone! I'm going going gone!  
Way this night going, man I won't make it home  
I'mma wake up in the room, wake up with a hangover  
What I spent last night I could've bought a Range Rover  
Got my Ray-bans on, yeah I see you haters  
Keep doing what you doing, cause I need you haters  
Say whats up to long stick, you can call it strong  
If I had to name my money baby, I would call it long  
Said I'm way too gone, I don't see nobody  
I ain't even on the bill, I'm acting like it's my party  
Smell like I'm on fire, oh I'm just that hot  
If I smoke another blunt, yeah I swear I'm gonna die  
You can call the weed man, tell him bring another six  
Yeah I know he just left, he gotta make another trip  
So hot in here, feel like I'm gon' faint  
Even though I'm past my limit, still think I'm gonna drink  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I woke up early this morning  
With three white girls wanna keep bonin'  
I'm blowing money fast, so caught up in the moment  
One time for the marks, two times for my homies  
I'm a rock star every night, I'm a astronaut outta sight  
Put Codeine in my Sprite, my wrist is full of ice  
Don't even know her name, just so caught in the hype  
It's OK baby, 'cause I'm a millionaire for life  
I got bitches on my payroll, they come like Vanna White  
On my Ethopia, we in Vegas so icy  
Got a girl at home, I know I'm wrong it feels so right  
On the first road, young i hope I roll on the second  
We in the club with thugs, this must be heaven  
  
[Chorus]

Yeah I told you Niggas  
Yeah Niggas  
I told yalls I was coming back niggas  
I want it down below homies

Yea I'm back and I'm shinin' on you niggas  
Welcome back

Been on my grizzy but now I'm back in the place  
And if you show me the money ill put this brick in your face  
And if ya ain't got mo money ill put this strap in your face  
And believing these niggas is like a slap in the face  
Welcome back

Fuck you man he ain't shit

Excuse me if I'm bein' rude  
Let me check my attitude  
Excuse me Mr. Attitude

Catch me at the kitchen table weighing out my business plan

Streets think its necessary that a nigga blow a man  
  
[Chorus]

And if he ain't showed the cash  
Then he gotta be bluffin'  
My dog hit me up  
He say he gotta lick  
Gotta bad jump shot  
So he might shoot a brick  
Talkin' records on my line  
That's a technical foul  
Don't know what the fuck you talkin' bout  
I'm hangin' up right now  
Nigga you ain't nick cannon  
And this ain't wild and out  
Playin my position

Instant replay yeah  
We bout to find out  
Hey where the referee

[Chorus: x2]  
If young is what they want  
Then young is what they gettin'  
They ask me what I do I tell em teachin' for a livin'  
What you say nigga

And I could show you how to make a mill right now  
  
He say he just touched down  
And he need a dutch downed  
Second time he caught a date  
Think he goin' out a way  
Thirty six skyline  
We goin' for the fresh down  
Fresh planned defense  
Every time he come around  
We goin' to the super bowl  
If I make this field goal  
I understand you gotta beat  
Let me turn this knee to three  
He trippin' bout the extra point  
Make sure you bring my extra cash  
Next time I see your extra ass  
Hold up call the play  
Yeah I'm playin' quarterback  
4 way 2 way bet I bring a quarter back  
Weigh it up bag it up pass it to my runnin' back  
I got short on my pay  
That's a flag yell this way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ninth inning bases loaded  
I'm going for the grand slam  
Tax free tax free  
Don't give a shit to Uncle Sam  
Youngin' playin' softball  
You playin' softball  
Yeah I'm playin' softball

Catch me in the outfield  
That's a whole lot of grass  
Tryin' to buy a franchise  
That's a whole lot of cash  
Yeah that's right I'm savin' up  
Think I'm gonna buy the team  
Watch me get my bounty on  
Trying to get my money clean  
Always quick watch the bitch  
Cant afford another strike

Then I can play another night  
Money fight money fight  
Gotta get my money right  
But first I gotta kick these hoes  
So make sure that you ridin' wit me

One false move will get your ass penalized  
Nigga you can't be serious  
What if Pac was hearing this  
"You bullshitting me?"  
I'm sure biggie would agree  
If he had to pass the torch, then that bitch'll go to me  
Now wouldn't you agree? does it matter? I accept  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Have you ever see a blue rolls go on the black grass?  
Nigga go broke in investing a black mask  
Entrepreneur he found him a new crack  
A round of applause congratulate that nigga  
Cause when he get rich they goin' hate that nigga  
They goin' try they best to try n break that nigga  
  
[Chorus]
