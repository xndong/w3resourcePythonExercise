Does she love me, with all her heart  
Should I worry, when were apart  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know.  
  
Does she need me, as she pretends  
Is this a game, well then will I win  
It's a lover's question, I'd like to know  
  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just how I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.  
  
I'd like to know when she's not with me  
If she's still true to me  
I'd like to know when we're kissing  
Does she feel just how I feel,  
And how am I to know it's really real.  
  
Oh, tell me where, the answer lies  
Is it in her kiss or in her eyes  
It's a lover's question I'd like to know.  
  
I'd like to know.  
Oh, I'd like to know.  
  
Answer my, lover's question

Back in the days of the 33 and 45  
First time I remember feelin' alive  
Playin' like a'ringin' a bell 'n' I learned it off the radio  
Sure it was only mama's broom but I was strummin' like a fool  
A true believer till the day I die  
If you'd a plugged me in, in front of all my friends  
I would'a set the livin' room on fire  
I was alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Like a time bomb tickin'  
Headed for the Hullaballoo  
There were no big gigs in sight  
No bright white-hot spotlight  
But everybody knew that I was Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Got in a battle of the bands when I stole my big brother's guitar  
Let me tell you, that'll never get you far  
2000 Overnights later 'n' I'm still not on the radio  
Got a new Best Friend  
He was more than Sittin' In  
'N' we were makin' our mark on the road  
Our regalia'd hit Full Sail  
'N' we were trapped into the Mother Lode  
We was alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Like a time-bomb tickin'  
On the cover of the Rollin' Stone  
As far as we could see  
It was the way it was meant to be  
The whole world knew that we was  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
It's been miles 'n' miles  
Still Alive  
And pickin'  
Now I'm in the daze of the downloadin' digital fights  
Bit by bit, byte by byte  
But everybody says it's music 'cause they hear it on the radio  
'N' when I hit the stage I'm gonna rattle your cage  
I still remember how to howl at the moon  
And I can carry the load whether I'm on the road  
Or jus' appearing in my living room  
'Cause I am alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  
Like a time-bomb tickin'  
This boy's ready to blow  
Don't need to tell you why  
I'm gonna love to do it 'til the day I die  
Everybody's gonna know that I  
Am Alive 'n' Kickin'  
We been rockin' since '73  
And just between you 'n' me  
You better believe that we  
Are alive  
Alive 'n' Kickin'  

Day is done and night is calling  
From the window light is falling  
Shadows spinning on the walls  
And dancing in the light  
And 'round the door the kids are playing  
Like June bugs into the light  
And it seems like I'm looking at a mighty good time  
All alone tonight  
Hands a-clapping, voices singing  
Tambourines and guitars ringing  
Echoes through the willows  
Bringing music to the night  
And in the wind the whippoorwill's crying  
Cold and all alone  
And I am standing outside of a mighty good time  
All alone tonight  
Well, I can't recall when Louisiana music  
Ever sounded so sweet  
Just listen to the fiddle playing  
'Bonaparte's Retreat'  
Well, I just can't take no more  
I gotta make it through that door  
And dance until the break of day  
As long as there's still music playing  
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight  
Well, I just can't take no more  
I gotta make it through that door  
And dance until the break of day  
As long as there's still music playing  
Bet your life, I won't be staying all alone tonight  

Every time I'm around you  
I'm caught by surprise  
A sense of electric anticipation  
Rolls into me when you smile.  
  
And I know that you're filled by emotion  
'Cause I see it in the tear  
That you hide  
Girl I don't want you to go  
'N I don't need you to know  
If forever is a part of your life  
  
[horus]  
All I ask of you  
Is hear your heart  
All I ask of you  
Is trust it babe  
  
They call love "illusion"  
They say "falling in love's a mistake"  
"It could be just about anybody"  
But I don't see it that way  
  
Hey I know what's in you  
Because I can feel it too.  
And I've never been more scared in my life  
  
'N I don't want you to go  
'N girl I don't need to know  
If forever's what I see in  
Your eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just as the night  
Knows the sun's comin' home  
Trust that our love  
Has a mind of its own

Hush a bye  
Don't you cry  
Go to sleep my little baby  
When you wake  
You shall have  
All the pretty little ponies  
  
In your bed  
Momma said  
Baby's riding off to dreamland  
One by one  
They've begun  
Dance and prance for little baby  
Blacks and bays, dapples and greys  
Running in the night  
When you wake  
You shall have  
All the pretty little ponies  
  
Can you see the little ponies  
Dance before your eyes  
All the pretty little ponies  
Will be there when you arise

Time, time and again I see you staring down at me  
Now, then and again I wonder what it is that you see  
with those Angry Eyes  
Well, I bet you wish you could cut me down  
With those Angry Eyes  
  
You want to believe that I am not the same as you  
And now I can't conceive, oh Lord, of what it is you're trying to do  
with those Angry Eyes  
Well, I bet you wish you could cut me down  
with those Angry Eyes  
What a shot you could be if you could shoot at me  
With those Angry Eyes  
  
You and I must start to realize  
Blindness binds us in a false disguise  
Can you see me through those Angry Eyes?  
  
You try to defend that you are not the one to blame  
But I'm finding it hard, my friend, when I 'm in the deadly aim  
Of those Angry Eyes  
Well, I bet you wish you could cut me down  
With those Angry Eyes  
What a shot you could be if you could shoot at me  
With those Angry Eyes

Baby mine, don't you cry  
Baby mine, dry your eyes  
Rest your head close to my heart  
Never to part, baby of mine  
  
Little one when you play  
Don't you mind what they say  
Let those eyes sparkle and shine  
Never a tear, baby of mine  
  
If they knew sweet little you  
They'd end up loving you too  
All those same people who scold you  
What they'd give just for  
The right to hold you  
  
From your head to your toes  
You're not much, goodness knows  
But you're so precious to me  
Cute as can be, baby of mine

A vision, a flash of light  
A gift we were given, within each other's dreams  
We lived in the gardens of Avalon  
Together, believed that we could live there forever  
Then it faded away  
Forgetting, we wandered too far from the land we'd known  
  
Of all the lonely people, you're among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is a lesson hard to learn  
It's never as easy to return  
But if you're willing to go on  
We'll find a way back to Avalon  
  
Avalon  
  
They had it, it wasn't far away or imagined  
He held her in his arms and planned it all  
The towers of Avalon  
They warned him, he only turned around for a moment  
And everything had changed  
He noticed the sun on her face as she turned away  
  
All the lonely people, you're among the lucky few  
If it comes even once in a life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And when you come to know the miracle, it's mystical  
When someone else's heart is in your hand  
I learned too late, now I must try and find a way back home, ohh  
  
Here is a lesson hard to learn  
It's never as easy to return  
But if you're willing to go on  
We'll find a way back to Avalon  
  
(Avalon)  
We gotta go back, someday we'll get it back  
(Avalon)  
We gotta get it back  
(Avalon)  
Somebody show me a way, somebody tell me the way  
(Avalon)  
  
(Avalon)  
We gotta go back, someday we'll get it back  
(Avalon)  
We gotta get it back  
(Avalon)  
Somebody show me a way, somebody tell me the way  
(Avalon)

Tale as old as time  
True as it can be  
Barely even friends  
Then somebody bends  
Unexpectedly  
  
Just a little change  
Small to say the least  
Both a little scared  
Neither one prepared  
Beauty and the Beast  
  
Ever just the same  
Ever a suprise  
Ever just as sure  
Ever as before  
As the sun will rise  
  
Certain as the sun  
Rising in the east  
Tale as old as time  
Song as old as ryhme  
Beauty and the Beast

I am opening  
I am opening up  
  
Birth Energy  
Be my teacher  
Birth Energy  
Heal my fears  
Teach me trust  
Teach me compassion  
Walk me into the darkness  
And into your light  
  
Birth Energy  
You are Woman  
Birth Energy  
Within the Man  
Ever constant  
Ever changing  
Let your winds blow  
Rock me in your storm  
  
Let the bough break  
Let me fall  
Into your arms  
It is you I trust  
When I say  
I'm trusting Love  
  
INVOCATION:  
I stand among the Sisters of the Moon  
I am held by the Creator of the world  
I am opening  
I am unbounded  
I am luminous  
I am powerful  
I surrender to this power  
Life and newness are continued and  
renewed through me  
  
You are the ocean  
I ride upon your waves  
I am opening  
I am blown apart by your caress  
I surrender to you  
I embrace you  
  
I am ready now to sing the Moon  
To be Her voice  
I am The Singer  
And Life is Her song  
I sing Creation  
I sing joy and pain  
Beginning and ending  
Giving and taking  
Existence  
Goddess  
I embrace you  
I am opening  
I am opening up

Found your picture in an old coat  
And the ghost stirred deep inside.  
All this time and I still feel the cold  
From the madness in my pride.  
Don't know why you ended it that way  
I would've thought that you would tell  
Me to my face  
CHORUS  
Color me blue on blu  
Color me sadness without you.  
Color me blue on blue  
And I will wear it well.  
I will wear it well.  
Painted someone from a vision.  
You saw the future in his eyes.  
I know that wasn't how you pictured me.  
You stole my hope, now I'll never know why.  
Two hearts who began to beat as one.  
I guess you scared yourself  
And now you're on the run.  
  

Well, there hasn't been a party on a Saturday night  
When the music starts rollin' and the feelin' is right  
Some joker in the back screams loud as he can  
Boogie is the message that he sends to the band  
So if you really want to boogie  
You better begin by getting up on your feet  
  
And boogie, boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Well, if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me, baby, tonight  
  
There was a time when boogie was the law of the land  
And everybody'd boogie from New York to Japan  
Even little babies sing before they can speak  
To do the boogie woogie just by putting the beat  
So if you really want to boogie  
You better begin by getting up on your feet  
  
And boogie, boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
Well, if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me, baby, tonight  
  
Well, boogie, boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
I said, "Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie"  
Boogie woogie, baby, now boogie  
  
Do you really want to boogie?  
Yes, I would really like to woogie  
Well, if you really want to boogie  
Then boogie with me, baby, tonight  
I'm gonna do your little boogie tonight

Home for the holidays,  
I believe I've missed each and every face,  
Come on and play my music,  
Let's turn on the love light in the place  
  
It's time I found myself,  
Totally surrounded in your circles  
Whoa, my friends  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Give me a number,  
Please, celebrate me home  
Play me one more song,  
That I'll always remember,  
And I can recall,  
Whenever I find myself too all alone,  
I can sing me home.  
  
Uneasy highway,  
Traveling where the Westerly winds can fly,  
Somebody tried to tell me,  
But the men forgot to tell me why,  
  
I gotta count on being gone,  
Come on woman, come on daddy,  
Be what you want from me,  
I'm this strong, I'll be weak  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Give me a number,  
Please, celebrate me home  
Play me one more song,  
That I'll always remember,  
I can recall,  
Whenever I find myself too all alone,  
I can make believe I've never gone,  
I never know where I belong,  
Sing me home.  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Give me a number,  
Please, celebrate me home  
Play me one more song,  
  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Celebrate, celebrate  
Celebrate me home  
  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Well I'm finally here,  
But I'm bound to roam,  
Come on celebrate me home  
Well I'm finally here,  
But I'm bound to roam,  
Come on celebrate me home  
Well I'm finally here,  
But I'm bound to roam,  
Come on celebrate me home  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,  
Please, celebrate me home,

Christmas time is here  
Happiness and cheer  
Fun for all  
The children call  
  
Favorite time of year  
Snowflakes in the air  
Carols everywhere  
Olden times  
  
And ancient rhymes  
Love and dreams to share  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
Christmas time is here  
Families drawing near  
  
Oh that we could always see  
Such spirit through the year  
Sleigh bells in the air  
Beauty everywhere  
  
Yuletide by the fireside  
And joyful memories there  
Christmas time is here  
Families drawing near  
  
Oh that we could always see  
A favorite time of year

When you feel afraid,  
When you lose your way, I'll find you,  
Just try to smile, and dry your eyes,

Just keep listening,  
Let it sing, let it sing.  
  
Though you've grown away  
No matter how you'll change  
I'll know you.  
And when you tire of life alone,  
There will always be one sure way back home  
  
Just turn on the quiet,  
And you close your eyes  
And listen inside  
(unconditional)  
(unconditional)  
(unconditional)  
  
I'll be there to sing to you,  
I promise you  
I promise to  
Comfort you

Lullay, Thou little tiny Child,

O sisters too, how may we do,  
For to preserve this day.

Herod the king, in his raging,  
Charged he hath this day.  
His men of might, in his own sight,  
All young children to slay.  
  
That woe is me, poor Child for Thee!  
And ever morn and day,  
For thy parting neither say nor sing,  
By, by, lully, lullay.

People smile and tell me I'm the lucky one, and we've just begun,  
Think I'm gonna have a son.  
He will be like she and me, as free as a dove, conceived in love,  
Sun is gonna shine above.  
  
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,  
And everything will bring a chain of love.  
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.  
  
Seems as though a month ago I beta chi, never got high,  
Oh, I was a sorry guy.  
And now a smile, a face, a girl that shares my name,  
Now I'm through with the game, this boy will never be the same.  
  
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,  
And everything will bring a chain of love.  
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,

Pisces, Virgo rising is a very good sign, strong and kind,  
And the little boy is mine.  
Now I see a family where there once was none, now we've just begun,  
Yeah, we're gonna fly to the sun.  
  
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,  
And everything will bring a chain of love.  
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,

Love her and she'll bring you luck.  
And if you find she helps your mind, buddy, take her home,  
Don't you live alone, try to earn what lovers own.  
  
And even though we ain't got money, I'm so in love with ya honey,  
And everything will bring a chain of love.  
And in the morning when I rise, you bring a tear of joy to my eyes,  
And tell me everything is gonna be alright.

Once upon a dream  
Moonlit wings come into view  
Winter casts her spell  
And all the world is born anew  
  
A child sees a star through a window  
He knows with all his heart  
That wonder is coming  
Waiting  
  
Hoping  
Believing  
  
Only in December  
Are hearts so full  
Or feel more alone  
Could it be the same  
For everyone  
  
Only in December  
Can the broken heart  
Feel so alive  
And the autumn ashes  
  
Become the fires of December  
Can I be inside  
And out of the cold  
Still I know  
  
December always leads me home  
I still believe in magic  
Always leads me home  
And I still believe in miracles, mmm yes  
  
Still believe in Christmas  
I still believe in love

Ev'ry night I watch the lights from the house upon the hill  
I love a little girl who lives up there and I guess I always will  
But I don't dare knock upon her door, 'cause her daddy is my boss man  
So I got to try to be content, to see her whenever I can, goin'  
Chorus:  
Down in the boondocks, down in the boondocks  
People put me down, 'cause that's the side of town I was born in  
I love her, she loves me, but I don't fit in her society  
Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks  
But I need money, honey, give me money, honey  
Money, honey, (I need enough) money, honey  
I'll take it to the bank, I'll take it all down, just say it to me, oh man  
chorus  
One fine day I'll find a way to move from this old shack  
I'll hold my head up like a king and I never will look back  
Until that day I'll work and slave, and I'll save every dime  
But tonight she'll have to steal away to see me one more time, goin'  
chorus repeats 2x  
Lord have mercy on a boy from down in the boondocks  
Mama have mercy on a boy from down in the - ooh  
Have mercy baby, a little mercy, hang around all day, take me  
Down in the boondocks, da-da-down in the boondocks (repeats out)

Slow talkin', the line you're walkin'  
Look like a viper wearin' silkin' stockings  
You make 'em guess they'd be gettin' the best  
Can't help but wonder if you'd pass the test  
Kissin' my fingers, you touch my face  
'n play your hand like you're holdin' the ace  
But Baby when it comes around, are you gonna pick it up or lay it down  
You make it harder and harder to stop what you've started  
Chorus:  
(Down 'n dirty)  
Oh my little Rosalee, don't you think it's goin' on time we see  
If you're gonna come with me, I bet you, I get you  
I've had enough of this comin' on stuff  
I feel like gettin' down on somethin' tough  
I do believe you're what you're tryin' to be  
Now show me, honey, 'cause I'm dying to see  
Take it baby, make your play, we'll make love in different ways  
I call your bluff and stand, pretty mama, hold me in your hand  
And make it harder and harder to stop what you've started  
Chorus  
[Instrumental]  
Kissin' my fingers, you touch my face  
'n play your hand like you're holdin' the ace  
Baby when it comes around, are you gonna pick it up or lay it down  
You make it harder and harder to stop what you've started  
Chorus  
Rosalee, don't you think it's goin' on time we see  
If you're gonna come with me, I'm dirty, down 'n dirty

Dream by night  
Wish by day  
Love begins this way.  
Loving starts  
When open hearts  
Touch, and stay.  
Sleep for now  
Dreaming's how  
Lover's lives are planned.  
Future songs  
And flying dreams,  
Hand, in hand.  
  
Love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
So hearts, could soar.  
Heaven sent  
These wings were meant  
To prove, once more.  
That love is the key....  
Love is the key.  
You and I  
Touch the sky  
The eagle and the dove.  
Nightingales  
We keep our sails  
Filled with love.  
And love it seems  
Made flying dreams,  
To bring you home to me....  
  
  
(Instrumental section)  
  
  
Love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
So hearts, could soar.  
Heaven sent  
These wings were meant  
To prove, once more.  
That love is the key....  
Love is the key.  
  
  
You and I  
Touch the sky  
The eagle and the dove.  
Nightingales  
We keep our sails  
Filled with love.  
Ever strong  
Our future song,  
To sing it must be free.  
  
  
Ev'ry part  
Is from the heart,  
And love is still the key.  
And love it seems  
Made flying dreams  
To bring you home  
To me..

I've been working so hard  
I'm punching my card  
Eight hours for what?  
Oh, tell me what I got  
I've got this feeling  
That time's just holding me down  
I'll hit the ceiling or else  
I'll tear up this town  
  
Now I gotta cut loose  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose  
  
You're playing so cool, obeying every rule  
Dig a way down in your heart  
You're burning yearning for some  
Somebody to tell you that life ain't passing you by  
I'm trying to tell you  
It will if you don't even try  
You'll get by if you'd only  
  
Cut loose, footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Ooh-wee Marie shake it, shake it for me  
Woah, Milo come on, come on let's go  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose  
  
You got to turn me around and put your  
Feet on the ground, now take the hold of all  
Ah ah ah ah ah  
I'm turning you loose  
  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues, everybody cut footloose (footloose)  
  
Footloose, kick off the Sunday shoes  
Please, Louise, pull me off of my knees  
Jack, get back, come on before we crack  
Lose your blues,  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut  
Everybody cut, everybody cut footloose

Are those your eyes, is that your smile  
I've been lookin' at you forever  
But I never saw you before  
Are these your hands holdin' mine  
  
Now I wonder how I could of been so blind  
For the first time I am looking in your eyes  
For the first time I'm seein' who you are  
I can't believe how much I see  
  
When you're lookin' back at me  
Now I understand why love is  
Love is for the first time  
Can this be real, can this be true  
  
Am I the person I was this morning  
And are you the same you  
It's all so strange how can it be  
All along this love was right in front of me  
  
For the first time I am looking in your eyes  
For the first time I'm seein' who you are  
I can't believe how much I see  
When you're lookin' back at me  
  
Now I understand why love is  
Love is for the first time  
Such a long time ago  
I had given up on findin' this emotion ever again  
  
But you live with me now  
Yes I've found you some how  
And I'VE never been so sure  
And for the first time I am looking in your eyes  
  
For the first time I'm seein' who you are  
Can't believe how much I see  
When you're lookin back at me  
Now I understand why love is  
Love is for the first time

Now, while we're here alone  
And all is said and done  
Now I can let you know  
Because of all you've shown  
I've grown enough to tell you  
You'll always be inside of me  
  
How many roads have gone by  
So many words left unspoken  
I needed to be by your side  
If only to hold you  
  
Forever in my heart  
Forever we will be  
And even when I'm gone  
You'll be here in me  
Forever  
  
Once, I dreamed that you were gone  
I cried out trying to find you  
I begged the dream to fade away  
And please awaken me  
But night took a hold of my heart  
And left me with no one to follow  
the love that I lost to the dark  
I'll always remember  
  
Forever in my heart  
Forever we will be  
And know that when I'm gone  
You'll be here in me  
Forever in my heart  
You always thought I'd be  
I'd be yours  
Forever

Caught in the middle of a moonbeam, oh a flicker of light  
I took a look and then it run away, back on into the night  
Oh, stopped, stopped tickin' of my heartbeat, a look in his eye  
Had the hunger of a mountain lion and the thunder in fire  
  
And every time he appears it comes as a surprise  
And he thinks he's clever as fox fire dancin' on a distant rise  
Then when I catch that devil, ooh, there gonna be a slow down  
There gonna be a mighty slow down, yeah  
  
Caught in the embers of my night fire, in the cracklin' and glow  
I get the feeling he's a-watching me somewhere there in the cold  
  
And one of these days I'm thinking I'll take him by surprise  
He's not so clever as fox fire, dancing on a distant rise  
And when I catch that devil, there gonna be a slow down  
There gonna be a mighty slow down

I wake up  
In the middle of a dream  
To an unfamiliar scene  
Wonder what I fell into  
Who knows why  
People look for alibis  
In a passing stranger's eyes  
What am I supposed to do  
So tonight  
Tell her that you love her tonight  
The only way to know is to try  
tonight  
Give it half a chance  
And the glow  
From the bathroom down the hall  
Lights a mirror on a wall  
Where a stranger stares at me.  
"Hello, stranger,  
Where you been?  
Do you still remember when?  
Well, every heartache has an end  
'N maybe yours is on the way"  
One by one  
Let the nights go on  
And you won't need yesterday  
Beside you  
See yourself in love again  
And believe in the arms you're in  
Tonight.  
[CHORUS]

I had a good friend, sometime ago  
We had a good thing  
And we let it show  
Oh I was a fool  
I let him go  
Oh oh oh, how I miss him so  
  
I had a woman  
Who's love was strong  
She gave me her freedom  
And I let her run  
Oh, I was a fool I let her go  
Oh oh oh, how I miss her so  
  
I knew a fine man  
So strong with strife  
He ran for election  
And he lost his life  
Oh, I was a fool  
I let him go  
Oh oh oh, how I miss him so  
Oh oh oh oh oh, how I miss him so  
Ah ah ah ah ah, how I miss him so

Before you were born  
I saw you in the sunrise  
In the arms of my lover  
In the music of the islands  
And you were made of paradise  
Of ginger and pikake  
Wild mango and moonlight  
And dreams of our sweet ohana  
(Family)  
He lei poina ole ke keiki  
(A lei never forgotten is the beloved child)  
Aloha no, Hana Aluna  
(Our love to you, Hana Aluna)  
Tonight I rock you in my arms  
And sing of our tomorrows  
A song to call your own  
A vision of mohala  
(Opening as a flower)  
And this is my prayer  
My Hana Aluna lullabye  
Wherever live leads you  
Within you goes my aloha  
(Love and blessing)  

Have yourself a merry little christmas  
Let your hearts be light  
From now on, our troubles will be out of sight  
  
Have yourself a merry little christmas  
Make the yuletide gay  
From now on, our troubles will be miles away  
  
Here we are as in olden days  
Happy golden days of yore  
Faithful friends who are dear to us  
Gather near to us once more  
  
Through the years we all will be together  
If the fates allow  
Hang a shining star upon the highest bough  
And have yourself a merry little christmas now

You ain't crazy  
I ain't gonna lie anymore  
What you're feelin'  
there's a reason for  
I want to do right  
Oh, I gotta do right  
Do I love you?  
Oh, you know I've tried  
But what you're after  
You can't find in my eyes  
I want to do right  
Darlin'  
Tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
Maybe we're near the end  
Darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
One by one  
We're collecting lies  
When you can't give love  
You give alibis  
Now I'm gonna do right  
This time I gotta do right  
I don't want to leave  
I don't want to say good-bye  
But sooner or latter  
There comes a time  
When you gotta do right  
Darlin'  
Tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
Maybe we're near the end  
Darlin' how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
Why are you so torn apart?  
I need a little more lovin' in my heart  
People say that love will grow  
So how was I to know  
Love that's come through years and years  
Can't find a way back home anymore  
(SOLO)  
Darlin'  
Tell the truth  
Don't turn away  
This is our last chance  
To touch each others hearts  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
But maybe we're near the end  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart  
Does anything last forever?  
I don't know  
But maybe we're near the end  
So darlin' oh how can we go on together  
Now that we've grown apart  
Well the only way to start  
Is heart to heart

I like the love  
And I like the peaceful  
I wish everyone I know could  
Stand in the heartlight  
I hold the hand  
I walk with the teacher  
We welcome in the mornin'  
Singing together  
Can you feel the love that's in my heart  
Can you see the flame we got to start  
Burnin' like a beacon in the night  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
I'm like the rain  
'Cause I like your thunder  
I know we've learned to live together  
Here in the heartlight  
Stand in the dark  
Oh, oh and I'll light a candle  
And then we'll dance it in the moonlight  
Until the sunrise  
Can you feel the love that's in my heart  
Can't you see the flame we've got to start  
Burnin' like a beacon in the night  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, welcome to heartlight  
Can you feel the love that's in my heart  
Can't you see the flame we've got to start  
Burnin' like a beacon in the night  
Oh welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Welcome to heartlight  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
Oh, ooh, heart of light  
...  

Out in the city strees  
Alone and weak from the cold and hunger,  
Trembling hands unfold a photograph.  
Mom and Dan and Ann Marie,  
Smiles from a distant sunrise,  
The only smile you've seen in days.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
Come back to me  
Or I will fade away  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
I still believe in you  
My runaway.  
  
Jesse and Willy Lee  
Play in the street while their mother wonders,  
"Why won't they listen to a word I say?"  
I sing a lullaby  
To the baby in my arms  
And the laughter fades away.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come back to me  
Come back my darlin'  
I'm sending hope  
For the runaway  
Somewhere a flash of light  
Cuts through the night  
Like a lighthouse callin'  
All of the lost and forgotten.  
I made a vow I will continue  
'Til I find you.  
  
I'll never stop, I'll never stop believin'  
I will wait for you forever  
Sending you hope, for the runaway.

I was runnin' from paradise  
Busy dancin' across thin ice  
Then lookin' up  
I thought somebody called my name  
But I kept on walkin' on down  
On my own way  
  
I was livin' but not enough  
Turnin' my face  
From the face of love  
Then lookin' up  
I'm certain I saw your eyes  
And I don't know how  
And I don't know why  
But I know I'm home  
  
[Chorus]  
I am not hiding  
This time I'm deciding  
Now I'm showin' up  
To give it all my love  
I am not hiding  
Now I'm standing here  
Shoutin' out to heaven  
Runnin' no more  
  
Freedom was overdue  
I was starvin' for a dream  
And the dream was you  
Then lookin' up  
Big love was pourin' down  
'N I don't know how  
'N I don't know why  
But I know I'm home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The dream of love was more  
Than I could have  
I'd almost given it up  
But darlin' now it's back  
  
I am here  
You are real  
This time I'm learnin' to feel  
I have found  
Paradise  
Showin' up in your eyes  
  
This is all I know  
No more sad goodbyes  
Kiss it all hello  
I'm showin' up for my life  
  
Oh, love is what it's all about  
You gotta go in  
To get out  
  
For once in my life  
I've found my home  
Home in your arms, darlin'  
All I know is that I'm finally home  
Strong enough to see the truth  
You gotta go in  
To get out

I see faces!  
Coverin' an empty 'I'  
Empty spaces  
Where there used to be a soul inside  
  
Nothin' and no one ever gets to them  
Seems the wind could blow right through them  
Believin' in gods that never knew them  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love, I do!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
I'm feeling love!  
(feeling love is feeling good)  
I believe in love  
Feeling love is feeling good!  
  
Worry!  
Climbin' up your money tree  
You've got to hide it  
Monkey do what the monkey see  
  
You're on a one-way street and you're speedin'  
Missin' the signs you should be readin'  
That's the things you'll later be needin'  
I believe in love  
  
I believe it, nobody sold me  
Always knew it, nobody told me  
I believe in someone to hold me  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love, I do!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
I'm feeling love!  
(feeling love is feeling good)  
(feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)  
(feeling love is feeling good)  
  
I believe in love  
(feeling love is feeling good, I believe in love)  
Feeling love is feeling good!  
(I believe in love)  
Feeling love is feeling good!  
(I believe in love)  
  
Oh, never be lonely!  
Sleepin' in an empty bed  
Shouldn't feel it, just a place to rest my head  
  
But I don't want to find myself one day  
Wakin' up and lookin' at Monday  
With some 'what's-her-name' left from Sunday  
I believe in love  
  
I believe it, nobody sold me  
Always knew it, nobody told me  
I believe in someone to hold me  
I believe in love  
  
I believe in love, I do!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
Everybody should!  
I believe I'm feelin' good  
Believe in it  
Believe in, love!

Maybe it's true what they say about it  
Maybe we can't make the ends meet  
Maybe we'll all have to do without it  
Maybe this world's just incomplete  
Still we all look for truth in our lives  
Searching from different sides  
If it's so hard living in a desperate world  
But we all do the best that we can  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
Maybe there's too much to think about  
Maybe there just ain't nothing left to say  
But if our time's really running out  
Then this is no time to run away  
'Cause we're destined to look for truth in this life  
Blinded by tearful eyes  
If it's no use trying in a desperate world  
Then tell me, why was I born?  
Some people see a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
Lonely, living so lonely  
Is it too late  
To turn it all around?  
Some people dream a change  
Some will remain the same  
All of us live their lives  
Under the gun  
Some see the road as clear  
Some say the end is here  
They say it's a hopeless fight  
But I say, I gotta try  
I gotta change  
The world just remains the same  
All of us live our lives  
Under the gun  
Someone's sleeping  
Someone's giving up  
Someone's trying  
Someone's crying out  
Still we live under the gun  

Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Whoa!, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
I said the name of the place is I like it like that  
  
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Whoa!, I wanna show you (come on let me show you where it's at)  
I said the name of the place is I like it like that  
  
They got a little place a-down the track  
The name of the place is I like it like that  
You take Sally and I'll take Sue  
And we're gonna rock away all of our blues  
  
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Oh, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
The name of the place is I like it like that  
  
The last time I was down they lost my shoes  
They had some cat shoutin' the blues  
The people was yellin' and shoutin' for more  
And all they kept sayin' was-a "go man, go"  
  
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Oh, I wanna show you (come on let me show you where it's at)  
I said the name of the place is I like it like that  
  
Come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Ah, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
Oh, come on (come on let me show you where it's at)  
The name of the place is I like it like that

Love, where are we going,  
And when do we reach the promise on the horizon,  
  
Out on the ocean, under a sunset,  
I was invited to come out and play a while  
with magic and move a mountain.  
  
Has anyone ever captured the sun,  
Is the eagle ever truly tame,  
Given just a little time,  
I know that you'll find a way.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Give up the world I've made me  
And take you away,  
I swear from now on,  
The trust in my heart,  
The vision of you in my life  
  
My love,  
I will be faithful,  
but how can I make a promise  
to a place I've never been?  
  
Something has taken me off,  
and I don't know if I will survive.  
I believe that everything  
I'll ever need is here by the roadside.  
  
How can you fly,  
keeping heaven in sight,  
blinded by the light of day?  
  
Given just a little time,  
I know that I'll find a way  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Listen with all of my spirit,  
for ecstasy calling,  
You know I believe,  
Cause all I have seen,  
From the mountain,  
The view from the heart.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Give up the world I've made me  
And take you away,  
I swear from here on,  
The trust in my god,  
The vision of you in my life  
  
Freedom is mine,  
One beat at a time,  
Where are we going,  
I just don't know yet,  
How will we make it,  
I just can't say,  
All that I know is that we've finally sailed away.  
  
Seems everyone's made a prison of love,  
But if anybody can escape,  
Given just a little time,  
I know that we'll find a way.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Listen with all of my spirit,  
for ecstasy calling,  
You know I believe,  
Cause all I have seen,  
From the mountain,  
The view from the heart.  
  
I would do anything for you,  
Give up the world I've made me  
And take you away,  
I swear from here on,  
The trust in my god,  
The vision of you in my life  
  
In my arms, I'll pray  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby  
I am safe, I am loved, I am free, baby

What you thinkin' of?  
Darlin', you've been with me every day  
But you seem so far away, I know  
No, it's never enough  
To smile and say there's something on your mind  
If you doubt my love  
Know that it's here all the time  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin' more  
Girl, I'll give you anything you want  
Girl it's been so right  
Nobody could ever love you more  
I've never been more sure  
Where in the middle of the night  
I hold you near  
And take your heart in my arms  
Swearin' all my love  
That's something you've known from the start  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin' more  
I'll give you anything you want  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
Know that you're free to go  
Just be sure that what you want  
Is not what you got  
Hold me, oh, hold me tonight  
Forever, here, my love  
So you'll never fly away  
Gotta work it out  
I'm tryin' to hold on to our romance  
We've only got one more chance I know  
So tell me what it's all about  
Oh, darlin', if there's still a way to your heart  
I'll use all my love to keep us from fallin' apart  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
And if there is somethin' more  
I'll give you everything you want  
If that's not what you're lookin' for  
If it's not what you need to know  
Know that you're free to go  
Just be sure that what you want  
Is not what you got  

See her candle  
Waver in the window of her summer night  
Lying on the breeze  
She tries to fall asleep  
  
Flights of fancy  
Dancing through her memories like Arabian Nights  
He is riding on his wings of fire  
And flies away  
  
She can still hear him say  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
You'll think you're different from the rest  
You'll try to do your part  
Until he breaks your heart  
  
Lunch for the lonely  
Looking at picture postcards of someone else's scene  
Somehow they don't seem real  
The sea's too green  
  
Somebody calls her  
Giving out information  
About the boy on the moon  
Suddenly it's all too much  
To be told  
What she already knows  
  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
Because you've been told too many times  
  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
Because you've been told too many times  
  
If you'll be wise  
If you'll be smart  
Don't let a traveling man take your heart  
Take my advice  
Don't let it start  
Because when he comes and needs a friend  
He'll do it all again  
  
Better be smart  
He's breaking your heart  
Find you another lover  
Better be wise  
And open your eyes  
This time

I prayed for something I could never understand  
The Sword of Shiva to deliver me to unimagined lands.  
And there you were  
  
I asked for something that could catch me by surprise  
To leap into the belly of the beast to rip me up and bring me out alive  
And there you were  
  
Into your eyes  
I'm falling rain  
Into your eyes  
A hurricane  
Into your eyes  
I'm coming home  
I'm holding on  
I'm letting go  
  
Oh, I'm flying free  
O'er the land of the prophecy  
All my future below  
Oh, I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Then you whisper that all you need of me  
Is Just to Breathe  
  
Initiation to the wisdom of the heart  
An invocation know to humble men  
And tear their worlds apart  
And there you were  
  
I prayed every night n'day for something to believe  
Some brand of magic that could lift me up and bring me to my knees  
And there you were  
  
Into your eyes  
I'm falling rain  
Into your eyes  
A hurricane  
Into your eyes  
I'm coming home  
I'm holding on  
I'm letting go  
  
Oh, I'm flying free  
O'er the land of the prophecy  
All my future below  
Oh, I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Sworn to love you as long as I shall breathe  
  
In every other lover's eyes  
Keep it up, keep it up, keep it up, all your life  
In the line of duty we can never do enough  
I am surrendered  
I am ascended on love  
  
I'm flying free  
O'er the land of the prophecy  
All of my future before my eyes and  
Oh, I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Come and take me home  
  
Oh my father's son  
New reborn as the chosen one  
Now he kneels at your feet  
Oh, I pledge my life  
All I am to be by your side  
Come and take me home.

Seven-eleven he rolled  
And all his life was a golden gamble  
You'd see him reeling it in when the odds were high  
Something supernatural, a charlatan, a mastermind  
Or some lucky lady's design  
  
Oh, what the devil, it's fun  
His lady luck was his one companion  
And by the silver and gold  
His heart had been bought and bound  
But he chanced to fall in new love  
He kissed her and he cut the tie  
And kissed his lucky lady goodbye  
  
Oh, spin your wheel of fortune  
Shuffle the cards, blow on the dice  
Are you with me in love  
Like you've been with me in life  
If I leave you for a lover  
Would you leave me far behind  
  
You should've known from the start  
She'd take no part in a love triangle  
You have to be her's alone  
And go it on your own  
Because if you've found a new love  
Lady Luck is gonna step aside  
So kiss your lucky lady goodbye  
  
Spin your wheel of fortune  
Shuffle the cards, blow on the dice  
Are you with me in love  
Like you've been with me in life?  
If I leave you for an hour  
Would you leave me far behind?  
  
Seven-eleven he rolled  
And all his life was a golden gamble  
You'd see him reeling it in when the odds were high  
Something supernatural, a charlatan, was a mastermind  
Or some lucky lady's  
Or some jealous lady  
Kiss your lucky lady goodbye  
Don't pass this way again, goodbye  
Don't pass this way again, goodbye

Let the pendulum swing.  
Let the old guard surrender  
It is a new day, a new world,  
A new language I wish to speak  
The language of love  
May I have the words I need to speak my truth,  
To translate my heart and my vision  
To my beloved and his children  
To all who come to sit at our table  
Or walk with us through the market place  
Or pray with us by the water  
  
May I have the plain poetry to tell them how I feel  
Or why there is pain,  
If the answers are mine to know.  
And if they are, I ask the Spirit to let me share them  
With a light heart, with laughter,  
Wth no expectation, with humility  
But for the grace of Thee, go I.  
May I know my innocence  
Every moment of every day  
May I be a child forever  
Intoxicated by hot sand, cool winds, by love  
By my own communication to the Spirit.  
May my aliveness always be as loud  
When I make love, as when I cry  
May I see my own reflection in the mirror  
And smile  
  
My love,  
You are my teacher  
And I surrender to your heart  
The purest heart I've ever seen  
Today I give you everything that is mine to give  
My truth  
All my innocence  
and all my heart  
I am yours  
Let the dance begin.

Love can be a game for two  
But a real love  
Take ya more than a lttle bit of time  
  
Ya gotta keep on makin' it  
Though your arms are achin'  
Your knees are shakin'  
Your heart keeps breakin' down  
That's what life is about  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh wo  
Let there be music  
Let there be candlelight  
Let there be love  
Let there be young hearts  
Sendin' up hungry sparks  
Let there be love  
  
Life  
Like a smile in the Big Boy's eye  
He lit a little light  
'N brought it all in, in under seven days  
  
He said "I'm makin' em, a man and woman  
I'll let run but before my work is through  
There's still one thing that I got to do"  
  
Chorus:  
Let there be music  
Let there be candlelight  
Let there be love  
Let there be young hearts  
Sendin' up hungry sparks  
Let there be love  
  
Bridge:  
You wonder how it happens  
You question if there'll ever come a day  
We'll get your head out of your way  
  
Deep in the heart a' me  
The music, it plays the beat  
Its like a part a' me is turnin', turnin', turnin'  
Don'cha try to defeat it  
'Cause I know ya just can't beat it  
Somethin' inside a' me is
burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin',burnin'  
  
Repeat Chorus to fade:

A long tailed cat sitting by the old rocking chair  
Now he don't realize that there's a danger there  
But he don't care no rock 'n' roll chair is gonna boogie on his day  
'Cause when his tail took a low down, syncopate, yeah  
  
I'm going down to Orleans town, to get a pound of feed  
Be back home in just 'bout a half of week, yeah  
You may be a symphony, babe, but I believe in song  
Got a catchy melody so you can sing along  
  
Oh, they say, you know they're talking bout the girls that work up town

No swinging tail, no rock 'n' roll girl is gonna boogie woogie on my day

Heading for the Dixie holiday, yeah yeah, yeah

Love is real, real is love  
Love is feeling, feeling love  
Love is wanting to be loved.  
  
Love is touch, touch is love  
Love is reaching, reaching love  
Love is asking to be loved  
  
Love is you  
You and me  
Love is knowing  
You can be  
  
Love is free, free is love  
Love is living, living, living love  
Love is needing to be loved.  
  
Love is you  
You and me  
Love is wanting  
To be free  
  
Love is knowing  
You will be.

Love Has Come of Age  
Kenny Loggins  
(This Is It)  
The many times you've learned the lines  
That love has spoken  
So easily you love to leave  
Your heart's unbroken  
You've opened up a hundred eyes  
And given them a point of view  
Now think about the times you knew  
And hold them up to me and you  
Love has come of age  
You close your eyes and  
Fantasize a lost horizon  
A memory, a gentle breeze for love  
To ride in,  
But in your dreams you turned arouind  
And stumbled on a Shangri-la,  
You'll never be along anymore,  
'Cause brother now you've gone too far  
Love has come of age  
I'll stop by by tomorrow  
I'll stop by by tonight  
I'll stop by by morning. Momma  
It's alright.  
If a gigolo's what you're after  
You'll have to hold on tight  
Bye bye bye, later, baby  
Make it, make it right  
  

In a lifetime  
Made of memories  
I believe  
In destiny  
Every moment returns again in time  
When I've got the future on my mind  
Know that you'll be the only one  
  
Meet me halfway  
Across the sky  
Out where the world belongs  
To only you and I  
  
Meet me halfway  
Across the sky  
Make this a new beginning of another life.  
  
In a lifetime  
There is only love  
Reaching for the lonely one  
We are stronger when we are given love  
When we put emotions on the line  
Know that we are the timeless ones  
  
Meet me halfway  
Across the sky  
Out where the world belongs  
To only you and I  
  
Meet me halfway  
Across the sky  
Make this a new beginning of another life.

In my voice, in my smile,  
In the eyes of my eldest child,  
You appear every year in my life.  
  
In a dream, I have now,  
Standing still in my father's house,  
And I try another time to walk away.  
  
I learned that music and laughter,  
From the child that you hid in your eyes,  
And it's his song that I sing,  
Now who will sing for me?  
  
All my life, no voice inside,  
Has whispered, "set me free",  
All this time, has it been, you or me.  
  
I wait for someone to save me,  
Just like you did all your life,  
And will I find my home,  
But I alone, like you.

Two dozen roses  
A question that poses  
As someone, who's calling your name  
Listen, the loner  
The man on the corner  
Is singing you songs at the end of the day  
  
Lady be good, lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady, my love  
Lady I run, lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
I'll wait for you there, forever I swear  
My lady, my love  
  
He gulps and he chances it  
Dances his way cross the floor  
To the place where you stand  
He's walking, he's flying  
The poor boy is trying to be by your side  
When the waltzing begins  
  
Lady be good, lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady, my love  
Lady I run, lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
I'll wait for you there, forever I swear  
My lady, my love  
  
Lady be good, lady be kind  
Lately the things that cross my mind  
Are somehow the same  
Links in a chain  
Oh lady, my love  
Lady I run, lady I fly  
To come to your door and open wide  
I'll wait for you there, forever I swear  
My lady, my love  
My lady, my love  
My lady, my love.

In the night, when a mist of sleep surrounds me  
You come to me and hold me tight, winding your body all around me  
And everywhere you touch I feel, that my love for you is much too real  
Oh, it's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams  
It's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams  
Sleepwalkin' - I know every move you make, and every word I say  
Keep it comin', comin' - comin' on stronger, this time I'm going all the way  
Is this moment just a fantasy, or a vision of what will be  
Oh, it's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams  
Every night the same thing, wanting you in my dreams  
(Dreams fade away)  
I better find you in my days, or I'm losin' you to the nights  
It's the same thing - every night  
It's the same thing - oh, you're so right  
It's the same thing - wanting you  
(Instrumental break)  
And tonight, evening's shadows are sure to find me  
On my nightwatch, waiting for the warmth of you beside me  
And every second that you're here I feel, this dream is real  
And it's the same damn thing, it's the same thing  
It's the same damn thing, wanting you in my dreams, dreams

I don't know just what to make of this world  
My friends are wonderin' too  
I got some doubt about the state of this world  
'N what we're gonna do  
  
All I know is you  
'N the feelin' I feel is the truth  
I'm in love with you  
'N I don't need to figure it out  
  
[Chorus]  
All I know now is that  
I got No Doubt About Love  
Hesitation is out  
Now that I got No Doubt About Love  
  
You're never sure about your place in this world  
Or what you need to survive  
Some people say that  
What it takes in this world  
Is constant compromise  
  
But your love's so fine  
And I must have done somethin' so right  
To be in love with you  
And I ain't givin' up what I got  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can it be  
Certainty  
Has taken ahold in my life  
Imagine my surprise  
No doubt Big Love has arrived  
Every day I thank God I'm alive  
  
[Chorus]

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose  
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight  
  
They know that Santa's on his way  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh  
And every mother's child is gonna spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
For kids from one to ninety two  
Although its been said many times many ways  
Merry Christmas to you

When will we know love?  
When will we listen to heaven above?  
And how will we return?  
Someone said that we've been tempting fate  
But I believe this song just wouldn't come if it's too late.  
  
[Chorus]  
When will we see a light upon the ocean.  
Shining like a star  
That leads us ever onward  
There's a new world waiting  
When will we see rebirth  
This island Earth  
  
Maybe our moment is gone  
Maybe we've stood and watched  
A moment too long  
So why do I believe?  
Someone said  
That the truth's too much to take  
But tell me how we can face it  
If we only want to look the other way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To a new beginning  
Shine for all it's worth  
This Island Earth  
  
Why, what will we say to the angry child,  
Try to explain away her fears while we're crying burning tears  
Maybe it's time to cry the tear that matters  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh as we sail  
Through the stars  
We're alive on this island of ours

It's not the way that you say "Adieu" that  
Leaves behind you a smilin' fool, It's that  
I know you're a song come true,baby I love  
You,and I'll follow you till the ends meet..  
  
And it's the way that you touch my hand that  
Lets me know you will understand, 'cause I've  
Been feelin' it in the land, baby, I'm near  
You, and I'll follow you till I'm six deep,..  
  
It's not the way that you say "Adieu" that  
Leaves behind you a smilin' fool it's that I  
Know you're a song come true, baby I love you,  
And I'll follow you till the ends meet.

If you ever get the traveling blues  
And need a place to rest your shoes  
There's someone here to welcome the new  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
If knowing this should make you feel low  
And you're feeling the need for someone to know  
I love to hear your welcome hello  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
There's so many sights  
Those bright city lights  
Will help you try to find your way  
It's a big, big world  
And you're a big, big girl  
So hury up and don't be late  
  
But if you ever want to come on home  
There's no need in you being alone  
All you've got to do is phone  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
Mmmm, there's so many sights  
Those bright city lights  
Will help try to find your way  
It's a big, big world  
And you're a big, big girl  
So hurry up and don't be late  
  
But if you ever want to come on home  
There's no need in you being alone  
All you've got to do is phone  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
  
I'd be so happy to know that you're alive  
So happy to know that you're alive

I tried to tell you  
But the words always came out wrong  
You never knew it  
But I loved you all along  
Are we two worlds in collision  
Maybe it's time for you to listen to my  
  
[Chorus:]  
True confessions  
My love, I'm givin' you  
My true confessions  
Show love when you hear my  
True confessions  
  
Never meant to hurt you  
I was lonely and she was so kind  
One stolen moment  
That I can't get off my mind  
Let's end this silent suspicion  
Baby it's time for you to listen to my  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
No more hiding the rage  
Gotta let it out of this cage  
So won't you show me you care  
Ooh baby, won't you share

Where are you going my little one, little one  
Where are you going my baby, my own  
Turn around and you're two  
Turn around and you're four  
Turn around and you're a young girl  
Going out of the door  
  
Turn around  
Turn around  
Turn around and you're a young girl  
Going out of the door  
  
Where are you going my little one, little one  
Little pigtails and petticoats  
Where have you gone  
Turn around and you're tiny  
Turn around and you're grown  
Turn around and you're a young wife  
With babes of your own  
  
Turn around  
Turn around  
Turn around and you're a young wife  
With babes of your own  
  
Where are you going my little one, little one  
Where are you going my baby, my own

Two of us riding nowhere  
Spending someone's hard earned pay  
You and me Sunday driving  
Not arriving on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
Two of us sending postcards  
Writing letters on my wall  
You and me burning matches  
Lifting latches on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
You and I have memories  
Longer than the road  
That stretches out ahead  
Two of us wearing raincoats  
Standing solo in the sun  
You and me chasing paper  
Getting nowhere on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
You and I have memories  
Longer than the road  
That stretches out ahead  
Two of us wearing raincoats  
Standing solo in the sun  
You and me chasing paper  
Getting nowhere on our way back home  
We're on our way home  
We're on our way home  
We're going home  
We're going home  
You better believe it, goodbye  

Like bees with out the honey  
Or a sun that isn't sunny  
Eat a cookie without milk  
I wouldn't  
And it seems that you can't wear  
Just one shoe you need a pair  
Even if I wore them, Which I don't  
I couldn't  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same sky  
  
Every kind of game takes two  
I can't play without you  
I guess I better put my ball away now  
Even Bouncing is not as funny  
When you can't annoy your buddy  
I'd fix things  
If I just could figure out how  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same sky  
  
(Harmonica)  
  
Underneath the same sky  
Even though you're not close by  
It feels just like  
We're right beside each other  
Even though we're far apart  
Our friendship fills my heart  
It's so good to know  
We're under the same  
(Underneath the same sky)  
So good to know we're under the same sky  
(Underneath the same sky)  
(Underneath the same sky)  
  
Though my head is full of fluff  
This much I know is true  
It's lonely on my only  
Without you

I'm thinking about when I was a sailor  
Spent my time on the open seas  
When we'd stay off the coast of Jamaica  
I'd secretly steal ashore  
The natives were waiting for  
The boy with the lazy soul  
To sing with the sailor  
  
[Chorus:]  
Vahevala, homeless sailor  
Vahevala, homeward sail away  
Vahevala, homeless sailor  
Vahevala, homeward sail away  
Every evening I'd be gone  
Back on board by break of dawn  
  
I'm thinking about the nights in Jamaica  
Pretty girls dancin' here and there  
Stole a keg and now I'm drunk as a sailor  
The captain he don't know  
Where Billy he done go  
But I'm singing with native girls  
The songs of a sailor  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Every night in Jamaica I'd sing with the lady  
And drink with the men till the morning appear  
Healthy sunshine is fresh on my face  
As the songs of the night puts the ring in my ear  
  
[Chorus:]

Early mornin' lookin' tired and worn  
And lookin' out for the enemy  
You made all the way to Hudson Bay  
But you're right back here with me  
Tryin' to run away  
Your lips are sealed  
  
A runaway  
So tell me baby  
What you're wantin' me to do  
Givin' my love to you  
Mama don't you know  
Now you're livin' like a runaway  
Sunday dawn you met a Gypsy woman  
On a road to Tennessee  
She told you a lot about the world to come  
But did she tell you  
Why you couldn't tell me  
Like a runaway  
How one by one you run away  
Now tell me baby  
What you want me to do  
Givin' all my love to you  
Mama don't you know  
  
It's gonna be a hard leavin'  
You're gonna need a strong reason  
'Cause I ain't gonna start believin'  
That you're out of my life  
You bet you better do your fast talkin'  
Before you do your last walkin'  
It's gonna be a hard hard leavin' (talk to me)  
Vox humana  
I wanta feel the power of speech  
Vox humana  
Sounds so right so real to me  
Vox humana  
You gotta say  
What you oughtta say  
Don't try to run away  
Darlin' I'm lettin' you know

Here's a sweet September morning, there's the sense of Autumn on the rise  
He steps into the wind and sadly sighs  
"Why does it always seem to be, there's a cold December wind in front of me?"  
The more he fills his empty evenings  
The less he feels that there's a chance to find  
Something that can bring a peace of mind  
Is there a place where you can go?  
A little something you should know to turn the tide to your favor?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Wait a little while to welcome what you're after  
Give it the time to find its way to you  
And soon as you no longer try, you'll turn and find it standing by your side  
Come and get it, when you let it, it'll come to you  
  
When I run short on inspiration, I best recall what I've known all along  
'N I remember sweet September's song, there never really has to be  
A cold and bitter wind in front of me anymore  
  
Just forget it and wait a little while, while, while  
Wait a little while, everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while - every little thing's gonna come to you in time  
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while - everything will come to you in time  
Wait a little while

Sweeping low over an ocean deep  
Rousing up a mighty monster from his sleep  
we're walking in the air  
we're dancing in the midnight sky  
  
We're walking in the air  
We're floating in a moonlit sky  
The people far below  
Are sleeping as we fly  
I'm holding very tight  
I'm riding on the midnight blue  
I'm finding I can fly so high above with you  
  
Free as we can be  
Above the sleeping world  
As far as I can see  
(All is a dream)  
  
All across the world  
The villages go by like dreams  
The rivers and the hills  
The forests and the streams  
  
Children gaze  
Open mouthed  
Taken by surprise  
Nobody  
Down below  
Believes  
Their eyes  
  
We're surfing in the air  
We're swimming in a frozen sky  
We're drifting over ice  
and mountains floating by  
  
Free as we can be  
Above the sleeping world  
As far as I can see  
All is a dream  
  
We're walking in the air  
(walking in the air)  
We're dancing in the midnight sky  
(dancing in the sky)  
  
And everyone who sees us  
Greets us as we fly  
We're walking in the air  
Walkin in the air  
  
We're walking in the air  
Walkin in the air  
We're walking in the air  
We're walking in the air

If you've been thinking you're all that you've got,  
Then don't feel alone anymore.  
When we're together, then you've got a lot,  
'Cause I am the river and you are the shore.  
And it goes on and on, oh, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.  
Winding and swirling and dancing along,  
We pass by the old willow tree  
Where lovers caress as we sing of our song,  
Twisting together when we greet the sea.  
And it goes on and on, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.  
And it goes on and on, watching the river run,  
Further and further from things that we've done,  
Leaving them one by one.  
And we have just begun watching the river run.  
Listening, learning and yearning to  
Run, river, run.

When I was a child  
So wild and free  
Sometimes I'd stumbled  
Or fall from a tree  
  
But I didn't worry  
And I didn't care  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
Oh, he was my friend  
When no one could make  
Never too busy  
Oh, he'd find a way  
  
Then off we would rambled  
With the wind in our hair  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
But time has no mercy  
For a growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
  
I left my heart  
When school days were through  
With visions of freedom  
Oh, when dreams do come true  
  
I've never worried  
And I've never cared  
I knew that my daddy  
Would always be there  
  
One night while traveling  
Word came by phone  
The message was simple  
You're needed at home  
  
So once I did worry  
For once I did care  
I prayed that my daddy would wait for me there  
  
Time has no mercy  
For the growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
  
But time has no mercy  
For the growing young soul  
It leaves us with memories  
While it makes us grow old  
While it makes us grow old

Don't do anything mellow at the Whiskey  
Jimmy says I'm so unfortunate  
But let the people at the Whiskey be a bundle of nerves  
And don't sing on fairness  
Cause if you do, your musical insurance better be paid up  
  
Don't sing anything pretty at the Whiskey  
Johnny says you'd best take my advice  
Cause the stony little crowd will get to talkin' even louder  
And they'll smother you in hissin'  
And if they do, your musical insurance better be paid up  
  
Oh, don't do anything mellow at the Whiskey  
Johnny says I'm so, so unfortunate  
But let the people at the Whiskey be a bundle of nerves  
And don't sing on what they're missin'  
  
Like Sunday mornings filled with flowers  
Just goin' fifteen miles up north  
Cause if you do, your musical insurance better be paid up  
Cause if you do, your musical insurance better be paid up

(This is it)  
I've grown tired of fighting  
Whether you're right or wrong  
Whether I'm weak or strong in your eyes  
'Cause this is a lonely feeling  
Watching you turn away  
Why does it have to be this way?  
On and on tonight  
You've made a point of being right  
Making this a game instead of love  
You should know  
Where this goes.  
Someone's heart will surely be broken  
Before too long  
If we keep on playing this game  
Of right or wrong  
  
[Chorus:]  
Who's right, who's wrong  
When love is gone?  
Who's right or wrong -- false or true  
Never used to matter to you  
You're almost crying  
Saying "I've gotta run"  
Easier said than done  
  
Tell me why  
I want to know what you're hiding  
Turn around and look at me  
I've never been this hard to see before  
If we'd only come together  
For a moment here tonight  
You could hold me tight  
And ease your troubled mind  
You should know  
Where this goes  
Someone's heart will surely be broken  
Before too long,  
If we keep on playing this game  
Of right or wrong  
  
Right or wrong, lady  
Right or wrong, baby  
I'm right, you're wrong lady  
You're right, I'm wrong, baby  
Talkin' about who's right or wrong  
It never really matters  
When your love is gone  
Sayin' it out  
This right is wrong  
If all our lovin' is gone

The voices in the wind,  
Will take you home again,  
The journey home has just begun by friend,  
  
The magic in your eyes,  
Was more than I surmised,  
And I surrender time and time again,  
  
To the will of the wind  
The will of the wind, child  
The wind in the wind chimes,  
Takes you home again.  
  
The will of the wind  
The will of the wind, child  
The wind in the wind chimes,  
Takes you home again.  
  
The will of the wind

I have believed I would always be free and wild.  
No promises made or broken.  
But look at me now I come to you like a child.  
Here with my arms wide open.  
I follow the song that the voice inside,  
Whispers to my soul.  
How could I not, its my heart that brought me to paradise.  
I'll be your love, I'll be your friend.  
I'll be the summer breeze that never ends.  
For the rest of your days I'll be the road that takes you home.  
Like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on,  
I will be true to my heart.  
I promise you with this ring.  
Now I can say this is more than just wishful dreams.  
Nothing could be more real than  
Love  
Has the way of bringing you to your knees,  
Lifting you up to Heaven.  
I see the rest of my life when I look in your eyes,  
I love what I see.  
Living with you on the sunrise side of paradise.  
I'll be your love, I'll be your friend.  
I'll be the summer breeze that never ends.  
For the rest of your days I'll be the road that takes you home.  
Just like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on,  
I will be true to my heart,  
I promise you with this ring.  
May this circle never see an end.  
Here and now I willingly place a part of you upon my hand.  
I'll be your love, I'll be a friend.  
I'll be the summer breeze that never ends.  
For the rest of your days I'll be the road that takes you home.  
Just like the sun and the moon and the star that guides you on,  
I will be true to my heart,  
I promise you with this ring.

Come stop your crying,  
It will be all right  
Just take my hand and hold on tight  
I will protect you from all around you  
I will be here don't you cry  
  
For one so small, you seem so strong  
My arms on hold you, keep you safe and warm  
This bond between us can't be broken  
I will be here, don't you cry  
  
'Cause you'll be in my heart  
Yes, you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
You'll be in my heart  
No matter what they say  
You'll be here in my heart  
Always  
  
Sometimes we can't express the way we feel  
You learn to trust but you can't explain  
We may seem different but deep inside us  
We're not that different at all  
  
'Cause you'll be in my heart  
Yes, you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
No matter what happens  
There's one thing I know  
We've got each other  
To help us grow  
You'll see in time  
I know  
I know  
  
When destiny calls you, you must be strong  
I may not be with you, so you gotta hold on  
You'll see in time  
I know  
  
We'll always be together 'cause...  
  
You'll be in my heart  
Always you'll be in my heart  
From this day on  
Now and forever more  
  
Oooh You'll be in my heart  
No matter what they say  
You'll be here in my heart always  
Always  
Always  
For always in all ways  
You'll be in my heart  
Always in all ways  
  
Whenever you call  
If you ever need me  
I'll be there beside you  
My little

Sunny days and starry nights  
And lazy afternoons  
You're counting castles in the clouds  
And humming little tunes  
  
But somehow right before your eyes  
The summer fades away  
Everything is different  
And everything has changed  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
Funny how a photograph can take you back in time  
To places and embraces  
That you thought you'd left behind  
  
They're trying to remind you  
That you're not the only one  
That no one is an island  
When all is said and done  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
There'll come a day when you're losing your way  
And you won't know where you belong  
  
They say that "home is where your heart is"  
So follow your heart and know that you can't go wrong  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead you home  
  
If you feel lost and on your own  
And far from home  
You're never alone, you know  
  
Just think of your friends  
The ones who care  
They all will be waiting there  
With love to share  
And your heart will lead where you belong  
I know your heart will lead you home

Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
But when evening comes around and it's time to  
Hit the town  
Where do you go, you gotta rock it  
  
The old folks say that ya gotta end your date  
By ten  
But if you're out on a date don't you  
Bring her home late 'cause it's a sin  
You know there's no excuse  
You know you're gonna lose you never win  
I'll say it again  
  
And it's all because your mama don't dance  
And your daddy don't rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
When evenin' rolls around and it's time to  
Hit the town  
Where do you go, to rock it, rock it  
  
(lead)  
Everyone gather round let me tell you all  
About it  
You see I pulled into a drive-in and  
I found a place to park  
We hopped into the backseat where it's  
Always nice and dark  
I'm just about to move thinking to myself Mmm  
Bret this is a breeze  
Then there's a light in my eye and a guy says  
Out of the car long hair  
Oowee, you're coming with me  
Said the local police  
  
And it's all because your mama don't dance  
And your daddy don't rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
When evenin' rolls around and it's time to  
Hit the town  
Where do you go, play me a little C.C.  
  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
Your mama don't dance and your daddy don't  
Rock and roll  
They just ain't cool and they ain't about to start  
Your mama don't dance and you daddy don't rock  
  
Your mama don't dance, no  
She just don't dance, no  
You mama don't dance  
And you daddy don't rock and roll, oww no
