Sixteen years old, looking for a hideaway  
I'm a set designer, my Mum and Dad  
Thinking I'm gay  
I'm a lazy bugger, but I like my sport  
Like girls and music, I'm happy, happy sort  
(Of a guy)  
  
But there's one thing I'm lacking  
It's sexual experience  
So I ask you, my sweetheart  
Save me from this wilderness  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
  
Where I come from, love is  
Just a hole in the wall  
And the steel mills ring out and generations  
Heed the call  
  
And the rain never stops and the skies are grey  
And the chance of romance  
Slim as a bright sunny day  
  
This is partly the reason  
I'm so overwhelmed and shy  
Because your beauty, by contrast  
Is gonna make a young man cry  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this  
  
You don't know what it means to a boy from  
A suburban home  
To be left with a woman like you  
Completely alone  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
Nice place you've got here, babe  
Never seen a house like this  
  
Pool like an ocean, bed like a football pitch  
  
All the guys at the boozer, won't believe my luck  
But it couldn't have happened to a nicer bloke  
(Than me)  
  
So here we are, the record's  
Gotten stuck in the groove  
My knees are trembling, c'mon baby, make a move  
  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this  
I've schemed, honey, of a night like this  
I've dreamed, I've schemed, honey  
Of a night like this  
I've dreamed, honey, of a night like this

When it's love you give  
(I'll be a man of good faith.)  
Then in love you live.  
(I'll make a stand. I won't break.)  
I'll be the rock you can build on,  
Be there when you're old,  
To have and to hold.  
  
When there's love inside  
(I swear I'll always be strong.)  
Then there's a reason why.  
(I'll prove to you we belong.)  
I'll be the wall that protects you  
From the wind and the rain,  
From the hurt and pain.  
  
Let's make it all for one and all for love.  
Let the one you hold be the one you want,  
The one you need,  
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.  
When there's someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
And make it all for one and all for love.  
  
When it's love you make  
(I'll be the fire in your night.)  
Then it's love you take.  
(I will defend, I will fight.)  
I'll be there when you need me.  
When honor's at stake,  
This vow I will make:  
  
That it's all for one and all for love.  
Let the one be the one you want,  
The one you need,  
Cause when it's all for one it's one for all.  
When there's someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
And make it all for one and all for love.  
  
Don't lay our love to rest  
Cause we could stand up to the test.  
We got everything and more, than we had planned,  
More than the rivers that run the land.  
We've got it all, in our hands.  
  
Now it's all for one and all for love.  
(It's all for love)  
Let the one you hold be the one you want,  
The one you need,  
Cause when it's all for one, it's one for all  
(It's one for all)  
When there's someone that should know  
Then just let your feelings show  
When there's someone that you want,  
When there's someone that you need  
Let's make it all, all for one and all for love.

Went downtown on the two forty-nine,  
Playin' for recognition of the New York town.  
See, me and the boys got a rock 'n' roll band,  
They were so damn good, gonna lift up the man.  
  
Well, we got ups, we got downs,  
We got just so high 'til the sun goes down.  
Got the ego, can be abused,  
I got my two-toned shoes,  
And I can sing the blues.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Look out, kids, it's the F. B. I.  
We got a problem, you keep me high.  
Put on your clothes, take the smile off your face  
And put your money where your mouth is or get out this place.  
  
New York town is a meanass town,  
We got a thousand bands singin' underground.  
Way down in New Orleans it's the same old thing,  
Emotional music, a merry old thing.  
  
Old King Soul, he finally gave us a jolt,  
He played the vibes 'til nine and read from ten to four.  
He played upside down, he played inside out,  
Then a uniform band he was thrown into jail.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Gettin' hungry I know little woman,  
Can't get a smell 'cause my nose is blocked.  
I'm so high, I can't believe it,  
Hotel dogs are knockin' on my door.  
  
Two night of singin' nearly out on the end,  
Left the two parts red, oh what a square.  
As soon as the man, there's no sweeter song,  
Listen, McCartney, we're the band on the run.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh yeah.

Yeah, I said yeah  
I remember the first time  
That I ever seen her face  
I was standing by the drug store  
Tryin' to save the human race  
  
Took a raincheck on a blind date  
To get her prescription filled  
We had a short talk and a long walk  
Through the lazy cottonfield  
  
It was hot  
She was cool and sultry  
We made love  
I was broke and lonely  
  
She's wonderful, so beautiful  
So delectable, she's mine  
She's desirable, so lovable  
And it's criminal, almost illegal  
  
Well we woke up in a barnyard  
When I heard a farmer shout  
"Get away, boy, from my daughter!"  
When a shotgun rang out  
We took off  
She was right behind me  
Ran like the wind  
What a crazy lady  
  
She's fabulous, so sensuous  
She's marvelous, she's mine  
I'm delirious, it's serious  
Kinda dangerous, almost illegal  
  
Bring it down, now.  
We had a one child by the springtime  
And another on the way  
I got a new life and a good wife  
Ain't that amazing grace  
  
It was hot  
She was cool and sultry  
We made love  
I was broke and lonely  
  
She's wonderful, she's beautiful  
She's desirable, she's mine  
I'm delirious, she's serious  
It's kinda dangerous, almost illegal  
Wonderful, so beautiful  
She's not a radical, but she's mine  
She's fabulous, so sensuous  
And it's marvelous, almost illegal  
Beautiful and she's wonderful  
So desirable, almost illegal  

Amazing grace, how sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
It was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace hath bro't me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
How sweet the name of Jesus sounds  
In a believer's ear  
It soothes his sorrows, heals the wounds  
And drives away his fear  
  
Must Jesus bear the cross alone  
And all the world go free  
No, there's a cross for you  
And there's a cross for me

Did you ever stand and shiver  
while looking at a freezing river  
Have you froze to the bone  
with just a coat to keep you warm  
to keep you from a howlin' wind  
to keep you from a howlin' wind  
Now listen  
  
Have you perished in the drizzling rain  
Tried to light ... a lift but all in vain  
With your sock on your head  
and that old coat on your back  
to keep you from the drizzlin' rain  
oh to keep you from the drizzlin' rain  
Goodbye  
  
One more time  
  
Did you sleep in a graveyard when it snowed  
Laid your head on a .....  
With the Times on your face  
and that old coat on your back  
That kept you from a-withering away good God  
It just kept you from a-withering away  
  
I know  
  
And did you ride a lift on a steam train  
Now listen  
Had the misfortune not to pay your fare  
Thrown off the next stop  
Thrown in the doorway of a shop  
With that coat to keep you from the wind  
Oh that old school coat to keep you from the wind  
And that ain't all  
  
Have you had some good friends on the road with ya  
who'd stand by you through thick and thin  
Here's to Kevin and Ben, Susie and Len  
And that coat which never lets you down  
It never, never, never lets you down  
It never, never, never lets you down  
That old coat which never lets you down  
That old coat which never lets you down  
Kept me from the drizzlin' rain  
And oh, kept me from the drizzlin' rain  

I told you once I'm a jealous man  
But you never want to listen to who I am  
We're divided, completely out of touch  
I guess that's why we seem to fight so much  
  
Believe me darling this ain't no game  
If you think I'll be your fool  
You better think again  
I know you love me  
It just ain't right  
I'm sick and tired of fighting  
with you every night  
  
You say you don't want to hurt me  
But you're doing things I can't explain  
Oh baby, why don't you leave me  
Because I know you'll never change  
  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
Something I'm getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
But one day soon  
And it won't be long  
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
  
I'll find a honey to take a chance  
And roll that dice into my past  
She'll cover me for a little while  
And show me love ain't out of style  
  
I don't care how long it takes  
My heart's in the hands of fate  
Oh God I ain't asking much  
Just a woman that I can trust  
  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
Something I'm getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
Oh but one day soon  
And it won't be long  
Gonna find me an angel to carry me home  
It's only another heartache  
Ain't nothing to worry about  
  
I want to love that's strong and real  
I gotta know just how it feels  
Somebody to share my life  
To hold onto through the night  
  
It's only another heartache  
Nothing to worry about  
Something I'm getting used to  
Dragging my heart around  
  
It's only another heartache  
Nothing to worry about  
It's only another heartache  
Nothing to worry Heartache

(feat. Queen Latifah)  
  
(Herman Hupfield)  
  
This day and age we're living in  
Gives cause for apprehension  
With speed and new invention  
And things like third dimension  
  
Yet we get a trifle weary  
With Mr. Einstein's theory  
So we must get down to earth at times  
Relax relieve the tension  
And no matter what the progress  
Or what may yet be proved  
The simple facts of life are such  
They cannot be removed  
  
You must remember this  
A kiss is still a kiss,  
A sigh is just a sigh  
The fundamental things apply  
As time goes by  
  
And when two lovers woo  
They still say, "I love you"  
On that you can rely  
No matter what the future brings  
As time goes by  
  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
  
(Queen Latifah) Times don't change, right?  
(Rod Stewart) Sing it to me, Latifah  
  
Oh, I'm singing it to you right now  
Cause we're talking about  
Moonlight and love songs  
Never out of date  
  
Hearts full of passion  
Jealousy and hate  
Woman needs man  
And man must have his mate  
That no one can deny  
  
Well, it's still the same old story  
A fight for love and glory  
A case of do or die  
The world will always welcome lovers  
As time goes by  
As time goes by  
  
Time goes by

I'm tired of buying Penthouse and Oui and Hustler  
It's Friday night I'm all alone still a bachelor  
She said she'd call me when she'd finished work  
Haven't heard a word all day  
  
I may not be Warren Beatty or Mohammed Ali  
(Attractive female wanted)  
I ain't asking a great deal, just a female to move in with me  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
I'll share all my records, toothbrush and car  
And color TV, honestly  
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
She doesn't have to be a movie star  
Cover of a magazine  
She can work in a garage all day  
In the evening some canteen  
  
I'm tired of blind dates making silly mistakes  
It's embarrassing  
(Attractive female wanted)  
I've had no complaints  
  
But obviously you've guessed  
No compliments  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
Won't someone please answer my prayers  
Before I'm old and grey  
(Attractive female wanted)  
I've been lonely too long  
All of my family think I'm gay  
  
She doesn't have to be a movie star  
Cover of magazine  
She can work in a garage all day  
In the evening some canteen  
  
Attractive female wanted  
Active female wanted  
I may get drunk stink like a skunk  
But she'll look after me  
(Attractive female wanted)  
  
Put me to bed ease my aching head  
And made fuss of me  
You know what I gonna do  
Think I'll write a letter  
To Mr. Hugh Heffner confidentially  
  
Dear Sir  
A single girl for my single bed is my remedy

I really can't stay - Baby it's cold outside  
I've got to go away - Baby it's cold outside  
This evening has been - Been hoping that you'd drop in  
So very nice - I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice  
My mother will start to worry - Beautiful, what's your hurry  
My father will be pacing the floor - Listen to the fireplace roar  
So really I'd better scurry - Beautiful, please don't hurry  
well Maybe just one little kiss more - Put some music on while I pour  
  
The neighbors might think - Baby, it's bad out there  
Say, what's in this drink - No cabs to be had out there  
I wish I knew how - Your eyes are like starlight now  
To break this spell - I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell  
I ought to say no, no, no, sir - Mind if I move a little closer  
At least I'm gonna say that I tried - What's the sense in hurting my pride  
I really can't stay - Baby don't hold out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
C'mon baby  
  
I simply must go - Baby, it's cold outside  
The answer is no - Ooh baby, it's cold outside  
This welcome has been - I'm lucky that you dropped in  
So nice and warm - Look out the window at that storm  
My sister will be suspicious - Man, your lips look so delicious  
My brother will be there at the door - Waves upon a tropical shore  
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious - Gosh your lips look delicious  
Well maybe just one little kiss more - Never such a blizzard before  
  
I've got to go home - You'll freeze to the bone out there  
Say, lend me your comb - It's up to your knees out there  
You've really been grand - Your eyes are like starlight now  
But don't you see - How can you do this thing to me  
There's bound to be talk tomorrow - Making my life long sorrow  
At least there will be plenty implied - If you caught pneumonia and died  
I really can't stay - Get over that old out  
Ahh, but it's cold outside  
  
Baby it's cold outside  
  
Brr its cold  
It's cold out there  
Cant you stay awhile longer baby  
Well I really shouldn't alright  
  
Make it worth your while baby  
Ahh, do that again

Baby take me  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
I can't get you off of my mind  
Think about you all of the time  
Don't you know you know my heart  
All you gotta do is make a start  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
Give me a chance to prove it to you  
I would treat you oh so good  
'Cause I love you like I should  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
If you want a love that's true  
That's what I'm offering you  
It will be forever  
We will part never  
Baby can't you see  
You're the one for me, oh  
If you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
I can't get you off of my mind  
Think about you all of the time  
I want you all by myself  
And I want some on no one else  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that's oh so sweet  
Baby take me  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
And if you want a love that can't be beat  
Baby take me  
Baby take me

[Chorus]  
Beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
On this beautiful morning  
Here with you  
  
Driving down the highway on a Friday evening  
Me and my lady had stopped for leaving  
Early stop leave the city behind us  
Good to be the kid that cares alot  
We got just us  
  
We going Starbucks a doner and a coffee  
That's when I notice it was all around me  
And do today and there's gotta be a winner  
Rolling out the summer we're tired of winter  
  
Still left on we're climbing all of our years  
Still had hair on a true to fear  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No hesitation and we check into our hotel  
Down about a woosh about a mile at the disco  
Up toss the bed in a room that I seen you  
I just sat here loving that person in me  
  
Don't you worry 'cause I'm back in my case  
Get down to the beach and let the sun on your face  
Doves are singing not a cloud in the sky  
Oh my God, ain't it good to be alive  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause we keep tryin going fast  
Let's make everything last, oh ye  
Well singing , dancing , jumping around  
We cook, get drunk we all fall down  
Go through love, no regrets  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Call the girls and dress up fine  
Tonight I felt like suicide  
Roll them dice and pour the wine  
Shuffle them cards and deal them fine  
Got nobody to kiss tonight  
Nothing to lose but my appetite  
want to be silly and sing and shout  
Gotta get legless and fall about  
Turn the music up nice and loud  
Cheer me up don't bring me down  
Gonna lose my job next week  
Getting replaced by a silicone chip  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
Don't like the scenery don't like the set  
Tear it all down and start again  
Man keeps talking on the radio  
Telling me what I don't want to know  
Radiation wars and layatril  
If tax don't get ya then cancer will  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
I might have been a hero  
But I chose to stay in bed  
I might have been prime minister  
but right now honey I'm better off dead  
Better off dead, better off dead  
Better off dead, better off dead

Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow  
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain  
There he goes moving across the water  
There he goes turning my whole world around  
  
Do you feel what I feel  
Can we make it so that's part of the deal  
I gotta hold you in these arms of steel  
Lay your heart on the line this time  
  
I want to breathe when you breathe  
When you whisper like that hot summer breeze  
Count the beads of sweat that cover me  
Didn't you show me a sign this time  
  
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow  
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain  
There he goes moving across the water  
There he goes turning my whole world around, around  
  
Do you feel what I feel  
Do you feel what I feel  
Ah can you see what I see  
Can you cut behind the mystery  
I will meet you by the witness tree  
Leave the whole world behind  
  
I want to come when you call  
I'll get to you if I have to crawl  
They can't hold me with these iron walls  
We got mountains to climb, to climb  
  
Who else is gonna bring you a broken arrow  
Who else is gonna bring you a bottle of rain  
There he goes moving across the water  
There he goes turning my whole world around  
Turning my whole world around  
Turning my whole world around  
Turning my whole world around

Old man sunshine, listen, you  
Never tell me dreams come true  
Just try it, and I'll start a riot  
  
Oprah Winfrey don't you dare  
Ever tell me she will care  
I'm certain, it's the final curtain  
I never want to hear from any cheerful Polly-annas  
Who tell you fate supplies a mate, it's all bananas  
  
They're writing songs of love,  
But not for me  
A lucky star's above,  
But not for me  
With love to lead the way  
I've found more skies of gray  
Than any Russian play  
Could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall  
And get that way  
Hi ho, alas  
And also, lack a day  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
She's not for me  
  
It all began so well  
But what an end  
This is the time  
A fella needs a friend  
The climax of the plot  
Should be a marriage knot  
But there's  
No knot for me  
  
Although I can't dismiss  
The memory of her kiss  
I guess  
She's not for me

She came to the party  
In a leather number wrapped in chains  
Investigation found  
She was very fond of dropping names  
So I signed her book  
And drove her to her home  
And she looked so hot  
Started to come on strong  
Then she said so candidly  
As I was gettin' down on my knees  
"I don't really mean to tease  
But I'm shy, shy, shy, shy, shy"  
Camouflage  
That's nothin' but camouflage  
  
He was totally handsome  
With a winning personality  
Natural born leader  
With connections in society  
But late at night  
Alone with just his wealth  
He would stare in the mirror  
And never see himself  
He had a Cadillac thirty foot long  
He had a hit with every song  
Sounded like something's wrong  
Why, why, why, why, why  
  
Camouflage  
It ain't nothin' but camouflage  
Camouflage  
Ain't nothing but, nothin' but  
Nothin' but camouflage  
  
They were so well suited  
With an ambiance you can't ignore  
But nobody realized  
What went on behind closed doors  
He had many affairs  
But never felt fulfilled  
She would hide her sadness  
In alcohol and pills  
She bottled everything up inside  
He was too busy with his best friend's wife  
They couldn't look each other in the eyes  
Lies, lies, lies, lies, lies  
  
Camouflage  
Just camouflage  
Everywhere you go it's called camouflage  
Some people hide behind camouflage  
  
see A-M-O you F-L-A-G-E  
  
I signed her book, drove her to her home  
But I didn't know what was goin' on  
  
He had a Cadillac thirty foot long  
Had hits with every song  
  
He had many affairs but never felt fulfilled  
She was hidin' herself in some little purple pills  
  
Why, why, why, why  
Shy, shy, shy, shy  
Lies, lies, lies, lies  
Lies, lies, lies, lies  
  
Camouflage, camouflage  
Talkin' 'bout camouflage  
camouflage, bring it down  
  
Sometimes I worry about you darlin'  
You wear too much mascara  
Too much eyeliner  
Too much rouge, and it worries me  
Camouflage, camouflage  
Camouflage, talkin' 'bout camouflage

Listen everybody, especially you girls  
You liked to be left alone  
By the one you love, never phone  
  
I love to holler  
My friends sometimes say  
That I believe, I believe  
That a woman should love that way

We can't play this game anymore  
But can we still be friends  
Things just can't go on like before  
But can we still be friends  
  
We had something to learn  
Now it's time for the wheel to turn  
Grains of sand one by one  
Before you know it it's all gone  
  
Let's admit we made a mistake  
But can we still be friends  
Heartbreak's never easy to take  
But can we still be friends  
It's a strange sad affair  
Sometimes seems like we just don't care  
Don't waste time feeling hurt  
We've been through hell together  
  
Where do we go from here  
We can't play this game anymore  
But can we still be friends  
Things just can't go on like before  
But can we still be friends  
  
We awoke from our dream  
Things are not what they always seem  
Memories linger on  
It's like a sweet, sad, old song  
  
Where do we go from here  
Where do we go from here  
  
I can't play this game anymore  
Can we still be friends  
Things just can't go on like before  
I just want to be friends  
I just want to be, want to be, want to be  
And now I just want to be friends  
We had something to learn, something to learn  
Now can we still be friends  
Let's admit our mistakes

I spit on the streets in San  
Called the record and company man  
My enthusiasm filled the room  
  
I was young and I was keen  
With the devil in my stream  
As I hollowed at an old blues tune  
  
We can't sign your sign  
'Cause we're doper than the mole  
That you had on your nose and your clothes  
I should thank you gentleman  
For this life that you brought me  
Now move on down the road  
  
I remember how I used to say  
  
[Chorus]  
They can't stop me now  
The world is waiting  
It's my turn to stand out in the crowd  
They can't stop me now  
The tide is turning  
I'm gonna make you proud  
  
Well nothing was tough  
But I couldn't get enough  
Out this rhythm and blues I crave  
  
I was singing in the parks  
Singing in the clubs  
Then along came agony  
  
All the things he said to me  
And all the things I heard  
I had a point to prove  
  
I will climb this mountain  
With this god given gift  
If it's the last thing that I do  
  
And I remember thinking  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Born to ramble  
Born to sing  
In a new world of rock n roll  
Woman in particular  
Feel my heart will cry  
And if I hold my song  
  
Thanks for the faith  
Thanks for the patience  
Thanks for the helping hand  
Thanks for the love  
Thanks for the guidance  
Thanks for the talk and pride  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Silent as a willow tree  
This road moves like a, a river to me  
Sun goes down on Wisdom Street  
Break the glass and throw away the key  
  
Somewhere out where the fates collide (collide)  
Cigarettes and candlelight  
I sit here in the lone cafe  
So stripped away (oh, oh)  
So stripped away  
  
Ah, huh:  
Huh:huh  
Oh, ah, oh, ah  
  
Everybody knows  
I'm your street corner Romeo  
Everybody knows  
You're my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me  
  
Sit with me forever more  
Is the draft too cold when they open door  
Seem to me whenever you're drunk  
And we'll drift away, drift away (drift away)  
  
Ah, huh:  
Huh:huh  
Oh, ah, oh, ah  
  
Everybody knows (everybody)  
I'm your street corner Romeo (oh, yeah)  
Everybody knows  
You're my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me (ooh:)  
  
I feel your heart beat underneath my skin  
Like a New Orleans night  
But the rain can't get in  
So red-hot dig the beat up underneath a cool, cool night  
And the glass moonlight of spring  
  
Everybody knows (ooh:)  
I'm your street corner Romeo (oh, yeah)  
Everybody knows (know, yeah)  
You're my Juliet in rags  
  
Everybody knows (everybody knows)  
I'm your street corner Romeo, yes, I am  
(Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Everybody knows (yeah)  
You're my Juliet in rags  
And Charlie Parker loves me (ooh:)  
  
Everybody knows  
(I'm listenin' to ya, Charlie)  
I'm your street corner Romeo  
(Bird is fly high tonight)  
Everybody knows  
Everybody knows  
Charlie Parker loves me  
  
Everybody knows [yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah]  
(Fly away, Charlie)  
I'm your street corner Romeo-aca

Is it my imagination  
Or have I finally found something worth living for  
I was looking for some action  
But all I found were cigarettes and alcohol  
  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cause when it comes on top  
  
You gotta make it happen!  
Is it worth the aggravation  
To find yourself a job when there's nothing worth working for  
It's a crazy situation  
But all I need are cigarettes and alcohol  
  
You could wait for a lifetime  
To spend your days in the sunshine  
You might as well do the white line  
Cause when it comes on top  
  
You gotta make it happen!  
Cigarettes and alcohol [Repeats]

Darling, part of my life, it wasn't very pretty  
See, I was born and raised in the slums of the city  
It was a one room shack and slept 10 other children  
Beside me, we hardly had enough food or room to sleep  
  
It was hard times, I needed some thing  
To ease my troubled mind  
  
Listen, my father didn't know the meaning of work  
He disrespected mama and treated us like dirt  
I left home seeking a job that I never did find  
Depressed and down hearted, I took to cloud nine  
  
I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine  
Listen one more time, I'm doin' fine up here on cloud nine  
  
Folks down there tell me  
They say, "Give your self a chance  
Son, don't let life pass you by  
But the world of reality is a rat race"  
  
Where only the strongly survive  
It's a dog-eat-dog world and that ain't no lie  
It ain't even safe no more to walk the streets  
At night, I'm doin' fine on cloud nine  
  
Let me tell you about cloud nine, cloud nine  
You can be what you want to be  
(Cloud nine)  
You ain't got no responsibilities  
And every man, every man is free  
(Cloud nine)  
  
You're a million miles from reality, reality  
I wanna say upper, higher, upper, up, up and away  
I wanna say I love the life I live  
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine  
  
I, I, I, I, I, I'm riding high on cloud nine  
  
Your as free as a bird in flight  
(Cloud nine)  
There's no difference between day and night  
(Cloud nine)  
It's a world of love and harmony  
(Cloud nine)  
You're a million miles from reality, reality wanna say  
  
Upper, higher, upper, up, up and away  
Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be  
(Cloud nine)  
You ain't got no responsibilities  
(Cloud nine)  
Every man and his mind is free  
  
You're a million miles from reality  
You can be what you wanna be  
I'm feelin' fine on cloud nine

Spent time feelin' inferior standing' in front of my mirror  
Combed my hair in a thousand ways, but I came out lookin' just the same  
Daddy said, son, you better see the world  
I wouldn't blame you if you wanted to leave  
But remember one thing, don't lose your head to a woman that'll spend your
bread  
So I got out  
  
Paris was a place you could hide away, if you felt you didn't fit in  
French police wouldn't give me no peace, they claimed I was a nasty person  
Down along the left bank, minding my own  
Was knocked down by a human stampede  
Got arrested for inciting a peaceful riot, when all I wanted was a cup of tea  
I was accused  
  
I moved on  
Down in rome I wasn't getting enough  
Of the things that keep a young man alive  
My body stunk, but I kept my funk at a time when I was right out of luck  
Getting desperate, indeed I was looking like a tourist attraction  
Oh, my dear, I better get out of here for the vatican don't give no sanction  
I wasn't ready for that, no, no  
  
I moved right out east, yeah  
On the peking ferry I was feeling merry, sailing on my way back here  
I fell in love with a slant-eyed lady by the light of an eastern moon  
Shanghai lil never used the pill, she claimed that it just ain't natural  
She took me up on deck and bit my neck  
Oh, people, I was glad I found her  
Oh, yeah, I was glad I found here  
  
I firmly believed that I didn't need anyone but me  
I sincerely thought I was so complete  
Look how wrong you can be  
The women I've known I wouldn't let tie my shoe  
They wouldn't give you the time of day  
But the slant-eyed lady knocked me off my feet  
God, I was glad I found her  
  
And if they had the words I could tell to you  
To help you on your way down the road  
I couldn't quote you no dickens, shelley or keats  
'Cause it's all been said before  
Make the best out of the bad, just laugh it off  
You didn't have to come here anyway, so remember  
  
Every picture tells a story don't it?  
Every picture tells a story don't it?  
Every picture tells a story don't it?  
Every picture tells a story don't it?  
Every picture tells a story don't it?  
Every picture tells a story don't it?

You sheltered me from harm  
Kept me warm, kept me warm  
You gave my life to me  
Set me free, set me free  
The finest years I ever knew  
Were all the years I had with you  
  
I would give anything I own  
Give up me life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
  
You taught me how to love  
What its of, what its of  
You never said too much  
But still you showed the way  
And I knew from watching you  
Nobody else could ever know  
The part of me that can't let go  
  
I would give anything I own  
Give up me life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again  
  
Is there someone you know  
You're loving them so  
But taking them all for granted  
You may lose them one day  
Someone takes them away  
And they don't hear the words you long to say  
  
I would give anything I own  
Give up me life, my heart, my home  
I would give everything I own  
Just to have you back again

Fare the well my brother, please don't stand in my way  
I'm going down to that dirty town  
No matter what you say  
You fooled me and you ruled me, and you played in every part  
I gotta go, it's no use me stayin' home  
  
Goodbye my sister, please don't let me see you cry  
Gonna be a star some day, no matter what they say  
And when you hear the crowds, all callin' and shouting out my name  
Until then, my little friend, I'll be unsatisfied  
  
So long sweet Melinda, don't forget that you're my girl  
Gonna dress you fine, and if you give me time  
Make you proud like I said I would  
And if the Champs Elysee's no fallacy, if I find the world looks like it
should  
Candy cars, movie stars, street bars, then I could stay a while  
  
Well I love you  
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome  
And I'll miss you all  
Even tho' you're tryin' to hold me back  
  
Farewell all my family, don't you know I mean you so well  
Please appreciate I must make a break  
Just to see what I can do  
The stage is set so understand, I can't hide in the wings no more  
I've got to go now it's no use me staying home  
  
All I can say is I love you  
Shall I write or phone from Paris or Rome  
And I think I'm always gonna miss you  
And I love you always  
I think I'm always gonna miss ya  
Even tho' you're tryin' to hold me back  
  
And I love you and I miss you  
If you don't get no mail you know I'm in jail  
If you don't get no mail you know I'm in jail  
But I love you and I miss you

Some fellows look at the eyes  
Some fellows look at the nose  
Some fellows look at the size  
Some fellows look at the clothes  
I don't care if her eyes are red  
I don't care if her nose is long  
I don't care if she's underfeed  
I don't care if her clothes are wrong  
First I look at the purse  
Some fellows like the smiles they wear  
Some fellows like the legs that talk  
Some fellows like the style of their hair  
They want the waist line to be small  
I don't care if their legs all vein  
I don't care if their teeth are big  
I don't care if she wears a ring  
Why waste time looking at the waist line  
'Cause first I look at the purse...yeah!  
A woman can be as fine as can be  
Kisses sweeter than honey  
That don't mean a thing to me  
If you ain't got no money, baby  
'Cause if the purse is fat, that's where it's at yeahaa...  
Some fellows like the way they walk  
The way they swing and sway  
Some fellows like the way they talk  
If they can talk talk all day  
I don't care if she waddles like a duck or talks with a lisp  
I still think I'm in good luck if the dollar bills are crisp  
'Cause first I look at the purse...yeah yeah  
Keep an eye on the money  
Woman's got to have some fine greenbacks hah  
I ain't greedy guys  
Oh I don't want to work no more

By the time you read this letter  
I'll be outta your life  
Gone forever more  
But guess I'll survive  
I'm gonna leave my records  
And a forwarding address  
Ain't you glad honey  
That I'm offa your chest  
  
You said you wanted Paris  
Rome 'n' St. Tropez  
Perfume by Chanel  
And a ring by Cartier  
But I gave you headaches  
With my old fashioned ways  
But that's all irrelevant  
To what I'm tryin' to say  
I'm a fool for you baby  
Pride won't let me stay  
I'm a fool for you honey  
and I'll come back any day  
Guess I'll always love you all my life  
  
You can keep your Streisands  
Bardots and Lorens  
You're my everything  
But now you're my end  
It may be over  
But just before I go  
I can make a new start  
But I can't mend a broken heart  
  
So when I read about you  
In all the national press  
On the arm of so and so  
I may get depressed  
Cause I tried to love you  
But didn't fit in  
I came on the dust  
I'll leave on the wind  
  
I'm a fool for you baby  
My pride won't let me stay  
I'm a fool for you honey  
I'll come back any day  
I'm a fool for you baby  
I don't care what your friends say  
I'm a fool for you honey  
And that's the way I'll stay  
I guess I'll always love you all my life

Can I introduce myself?  
I'm a man of panache and wealth  
Sound in mind, body, soul and health  
Why I wanna kill my wife?  
I have this urge to take her life  
  
Been planing for years to get rid of her  
Not divorce, I really do mean to kill her  
She's so full of useless information and trivia  
That's why I wanna kill my wife  
I have a duty to take her life  
  
Her stupid friends get right up my nose  
They all wear annoyingly sensible clothes  
They're all so bleeding grandiose  
You know why I should kill her friends  
They're all driving Mercedes Benz  
  
He'll escape down into Mexico  
Sell the house and find a nice young girl  
He'll laugh and sing and he won't work anymore  
  
Should I string her up or strangle her in bed?  
Suffocate that little venomous head  
Or perhaps I'll just whip her to death  
Listen, do me a favor, kill my wife  
  
Do it for mankind, take her life  
Or should I act quite cold and deliberate  
Or maybe blow out her brains with a bullet?  
They'll think suicide, they won't know who done it  
I'm gonna kill my wife, I'm really gonna take her life  
  
He'll escape down into Mexico  
Go down into Mexico  
Sell the house and find a nice young girl  
Find a nice young girl  
He'll laugh and sing and he won't work no more  
  
The moment of truth has come  
I'm at the point of no return  
I've got my hands locked round her throat  
I'm about to kill my wife  
  
Don't stop me now, I'm gonna take her life  
Too late now, I'm gonna kill my wife  
Can't help myself, I'm gonna take her life  
  
Telephone rang and he woke from his sleep  
His wife snoring soundly next to him  
It was all a very nasty dream

For all we know  
We may never meet again  
Before you go  
Make this moment sweet again  
  
We won't say goodnight  
Until the last minute  
I'll hold out my hand  
And my heart will be in it  
  
For all we know  
This may only be a dream  
We come and go  
Like a ripple on a stream  
  
So love me, tonight  
Tomorrow was made for some  
Tomorrow may never come  
For all we know  
Tomorrow may never come  
For all we know

I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  
I love you and you alone were meant for me  
Please give your loving heart to me  
And say we'll never ever part  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling, I'm never lonely  
Whenever you are in sight  
All because I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me, baby  
I've given you my heart  
[Instrumental interlude]  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling, I'm never lonely  
Whenever, whenever, whenever you are in sight  
All because I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  
I've given you my heart  
For sentimental reasons  
I've given you my heart

My mama 'n' papa told me son that you're just a fool  
When I told 'em I was leaving home I was leaving school  
So then in a couple of hours I found myself  
Heading down that southbound road  
With everything I owned on my back  
I carried such a heavy load  
  
And it's a hard, hard road that I travel  
It's a hard, hard road that I travel  
It's a hard, hard road that I travel down the line  
And it's a hard, hard road down the line  
  
Well I want to tell ya friends  
That it's good to be a traveling man  
'Cause I'm doing what I want to  
Living just the best that I can  
Nobody putting rings around my neck  
To put me in a pigeon hole  
I've got my dog and my radio  
To listen to some rock 'n' roll  
  
And it's a hard, hard road that I travel  
It's a hard, hard road that I travel  
It's a hard, hard road that I travel down the line  
And it's a hard, hard road down the line

Have I told you lately that I love you?  
Have I told you there's no one else above you?  
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do  
  
For the morning sun in all it's glory  
Meets the day with hope and comfort too  
You fill my life with laughter, somehow you make it better  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do  
  
There's a love that's divine  
And it's yours and it's mine  
Like the sun  
And at the end of the day  
We should give thanks and pray  
To the one, to the one  
  
Have I told you lately that I love you?  
Have I told you there's no one else above you?  
Fill my heart with gladness, take away all my sadness  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do  
  
There's a love that's divine  
And it's yours and it's mine  
Like the sun  
And at the end of the day  
We should give thanks and pray  
To the one, to the one  
  
Have I told you lately that I love you?  
Have I told you there's no one else above you?  
Fill my heart with gladness, take away my sadness  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do  
  
Take away all my sadness, fill my life with gladness  
Ease my troubles, that's what you do

Someone told me long ago  
There's a calm before the storm  
I know  
It's been comin' for some time  
When it's over, so they say  
It'll rain a sunny day  
I know  
Shinin' down like water  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain?  
I want to know, have you ever seen the rain  
Comin' down on a sunny day?  
  
Yesterday, and days before  
Sun is cold and rain is hard  
I know  
Been that way for all my time  
Till forever, on it goes  
Through the circle, fast and slow  
I know  
It can't stop, I wonder  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah!  
  
[Chorus]
