I've been waiting such a long time  
For a love that's real to come my way  
Gonna take some getting used to  
Now that love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
After we make love  
It's so good to be lost in the afterglow  
All I'm dreaming of  
I just can't let the feeling go  
  
After we make love  
I feel I've been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now  
  
Now the world is full of wonder  
You've turned my life around in just one day  
I love the spell you've put me under  
Just one kiss can take my breath away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After we make love  
I feel I've been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now  
  
All the lonely days and nights  
Were well worth going through  
I'm so glad I didn't give my heart away  
So I could give it all to you  
  
I've been waiting such a long time  
For a love that's real to come my way  
Gonna take some getting used to  
Now that love is here to stay  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After we make love  
I feel I've been touched by  
All that heaven and earth will allow  
All that matters is right here and now

All at once  
I finally took a moment  
And I'm realizing that  
You're not coming back  
And it's finally hit me all at once  
All at once I've started counting teardrops  
And at least a million fell  
My eyes began to swell  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
  
[Chorus]  
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Wishing you'd come back to me  
And that's all that matters now  
All at once I'm drifting on a lonely sea  
Holding on to memories  
And it's hurt me more than you know  
So much more than it shows  
All at once  
  
I looked around and found that you were  
With another love  
In someone else's arms  
And all my dreams were shattered all at once  
All at once the smile that used to greet me  
Brightened someone else's day  
She took your smile away  
And left me with just memories all at once  
  
Ever since I met you  
You're the only love I've known  
And I can't forget you  
Though I must face it all alone  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I'm sitting here,  
In my own head thinking  
How you could be staring in  
Got my number too  
And I'm writing you  
Contemplating on the paper what I should do  
On the fireplace with the mail man  
Should I tell you or should I hold it in  
If my heart wasn't in it  
Baby you could just forget it  
I'd be gone in a New York minute  
  
You never give me attention  
I know you never had bad intentions for us  
So I'm writing you but I always fail to mention  
Cause you know I really don't like to fuss  
So I'm gonna hold it in  
  
[Chorus]  
(I'm writing you a) Dear John letter  
I tried to stay but it never got better  
I couldn't tell you face to face but I,  
I had to let you know  
Sometimes I want to hit the door  
(I'm writing you Dear John)  
Sometimes I think that I've had enough  
My hands freeze and I can't write fast enough,  
I want to get away but I can't obey when my heart speaks,  
You know I'm listening  
Some days I'm really touchy and  
Some days I'm willing to forget and  
Some days I'm still in love with you  
Some days I'm sad and blue  
  
When I don't check myself  
I get frustrated with you  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do  
I know that it's not just you  
It's some of my negligence too  
And I can't go through with mailing this to you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When I don't check myself  
I get frustrated with you  
And I don't know what I'm gonna do  
I know that it's not just you  
It's some of my negligence too  
And I can't go through with mailing this to you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm writing this letter  
Because it makes me feel better

Remember when we held on in the rain  
The night we almost lost it  
Once again we can take the night into tomorrow  
Living on feelings  
Touching you I feel it all again  
  
[Chorus]  
Didn't we almost have it all  
When love was all we had worth giving?  
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend  
Loving you makes life worth living  
Didn't we almost have it all  
The night we held on till the morning  
You know you'll never love that way again  
Didn't we almost have it all  
  
The way you used to touch me felt so fine  
We kept our hearts together down the line  
A moment in the soul can last forever  
Comfort and keep us  
Help me bring the feeling back again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Didn't we have the best of times  
When love was young and new?  
Couldn't we reach inside and find  
The world of me and you?  
We'll never lose it again  
'Cause once you know what love is  
You never let it end  
  
Didn't we almost have it all  
When love was all we had worth giving?  
The ride with you was worth the fall my friend  
Loving you makes life worth living  
  
Didn't we almost have it all  
The night we held on till the morning  
You know you'll never love that way again  
Didn't we almost have it all

Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear  
Ringing through the night, shepherd boy, do you hear what I hear  
A song, a song, high above the trees with a voice as big as the sea  
With a voice as big as the sea  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king, do you know what I know  
In your palace warm, mighty king, do you know what I know  
A child, a child shivers in the cold, let us bring him silver and gold  
Let us bring him silver and gold  
Said the king to the people everywhere, listen to what I say  
Pray for peace, people everywhere, listen to what I say  
A child, a child, sleeping in the night, he will bring us goodness and light  
He will bring us goodness and light

Oh yeah  
Nothing's better than family,  
For the ones who love you so  
Be a shoulder to cry on when you are in need  
They will never leave you alone  
When your friends bring you down  
And they drag you through the dirt  
And nobody is around  
They will carry you through the hurt  
  
Just remember that family comes first  
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around  
Do you think how dare they will love you.  
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),  
When you feel your strength is almost gone  
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)  
And you don't think you can keep holding on  
And they stand for your feet (just remember)  
Family comes first  
  
I can see you crying someone broke your heart,  
Instead of being with those who love you,  
You spend time apart, it's because you think  
They won't understand  
The pain you're going through, So you don't reach out your  
Hand for them, 'til they'll pull and reach for you.  
  
Just remember that family comes first  
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around  
Do you think how dare they will love you.  
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),  
When you feel your strength is almost gone  
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)  
And you don't think you can keep holding on  
And they stand for your feet (just remember)  
Family comes first  
  
Don't you be ashamed of your family, put you into this earth,  
And that's what its worth unconditionally, sometimes you may  
Disagree and wont see eye to eye  
Don't you run away they will be right by your side  
Oh oh  
  
Where you gonna run to? when no one is around  
Do you think how dare they will love you.  
When your face is on the ground? (face is on the ground),  
When you feel your strength is almost gone  
And When your heart is getting weak (getting weak)  
And you don't think you can keep holding on  
And they stand for your feet (just remember)  
Family comes first  
Yeah yeah (yeah yeah yeah)  
Comes first

Remember when  
It all began  
We were all in love  
Then came the friends  
Telling you when  
Your time for me was good enough  
I constantly  
Had to compete  
With your crew and their schemes  
Remembering  
Back in the day  
I used to mean everything  
  
(If we could just get it back)  
To the way it used to be  
(My only wish would be that)  
Nothing would change for you and me  
(I remember how it was)  
And I know that for a fact  
(We were oh so deep in love)  
If we could just get it back  
  
Now tell me why  
So many nights  
You had so much to do  
When you said bye  
Sometimes I tried  
I tried to make you choose  
Now tell me how  
You can allow  
You boys to control  
The time we shared  
It was unfair  
But now you need to know  
  
(Now if I told you)  
That I'm moving on  
(Boy what would you do)  
Things just ain't the same  
(We were supposed to)  
Conquer everything yeah  
(Boy let me tell you)  
You've got to make a change  
  
(If we could just get it back)  
To the way it used to be  
(My only wish would be that)  
Nothing would change for you and me  
(I remember how it was)  
And I know that for a fact  
(We were oh so deep in love)  
If we could just get it back  
  
(If we could just get it back)  
To the way it used to be  
(My only wish would be that)  
Nothing would change for you and me  
(I remember how it was)  
And I know that for a fact  
(We were oh so deep in love)  
If we could just get it back  

Oh, he's all

He's in my mind  
I am glad am I  
He's all over me  
The Lord is keeping me alive  
I know he is keeping me alive  
He's keeping me alive  
Like the Hebrew boys  
Thrown in the fiery furnace  
See everybody thought it was over for them  
But the Lord brought them out on time  
He's the firm foundation  
The God of all creation  
There's nothing that he won't do for you  
You can trust him, he'll see you through  
He's all over me  
He's all in my mind right now  
And he's keeping me alive

And he's keeping me alive  
He's all over me  
And he's keeping me alive, yes, he is  
I know the Lord he is

Everybody thought it was over for them  
But the Lord brought them out on time  
He's the firm foundation  
The God of all creation  
There's nothing that he won't do for you  
If you trust him he'll see you through  
He's all over me  
He's all over me  
And he's keeping me alive, the boy  
He's all over me  
He's all over me  
And he's keeping me alive  
And he'd keeping me alive  
He's all over me  
All over me  
And he's keeping me alive  
My Lord is keeping me alive  
I know the Lord is keeping me alive  
I know he is keeping me alive  
He's in my hands and in my feet  
I can hardly keep my seat  
He's in my spirit and my soul  
I will never ever grow old  
He's in my heart and in my mind  
I'm glad he's mine  
He's on the right on the left  
Over me, over me  
On the front and the back  
On the right on the left  
Over me, over me  
On the front and the back  
On the right on the left  
Yeah, yeah

And he's keeping me alive  
He's keeping me alive  
I know he is  
I know the Lord is keeping me  
He's keeping me alive  

[VERSE 1]  
Think about it  
There must be higher love  
Down in the heart or  
Hidden in the stars above  
Without it, life is wasted time  
Look inside your heart,  
I'll look inside mine  
Things look so bad everywhere  
In this whole world, what is fair  
We will walk the line  
And try to see  
Falling behind in what could be  
  
[CHORUS]  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Bring me a higher love  
Where's that higher love  
I keep thinking of  
  
[VERSE 2]  
Worlds are turning  
And we're just hanging on  
Facing our fear  
And standing out there alone  
A yearning and it's real to me  
There must be someone  
Who's feeling for me  
Things look so bad everywhere  
In this whole world, what is fair  
We will walk the line  
And try to see  
Falling behind in what could be  
  
[CHORUS]  
[BRIDGE]  
I will wait for it  
I'm not too late for it  
Until then I'll sing my song  
To cheer the night along  
I could light the night up  
With my soul on fire  
I could make the sun shine  
From pure desire  
Let me feel that love come over me  
Let me feel how strong it could be  
  
[CHORUS]

There's a boy I know, he's the one I dream of  
Looks into my eyes, takes me to the clouds above, mm mm  
Oh I lose control, can't seem to get enough, uh huh  
When I wake from dreaming, tell me is it really love, ooo  
  
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)  
How will I know  
How will I know (Love can be deceiving)  
How will I know  
How will I know if he really loves me  
  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
I'm asking you what you know about these things  
How will I know if he's thinking of me  
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak  
  
Oh, wake me, I'm shaking, wish I had you near me now, uh huh  
Said there's no mistaking, what I feel is really love, ooo tell me  
  
How will I know (Don't trust your feelings)  
How will I know  
How will I know (Love can be deceiving)  
How will I know  
  
How will I know if he really loves me  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
I'm asking you what you know about these things  
How will I know if he's thinking of me  
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak  
  
If he loves me, if he loves me not  
If he loves me ooo, if he loves me not  
If he loves me, if he loves me not  
  
How will I know  
How will I know  
How will I know  
Hey how will I know  
How will I know  
  
How will I know if he really loves me  
I say a prayer with every heart beat  
I fall in love whenever we meet  
I'm asking you 'cause you know about these things  
How will I know if he's thinking of me  
I try to phone but I'm too shy (can't speak)  
Falling in love is so bitter sweet  
This love is strong why do I feel weak  
  
How will I know  
How will I know  
How will I know  
How will I know, ooo  
How will I know, how will I know, hey how will I know, how will I know

I believe in you and me  
I believe that we will be  
In love eternally  
As far as I can see  
You will always be  
The one for me  
Oh yes you will  
  
I believe in dreams again  
I believe that love will never end  
And like the river finds the sea  
I was lost now I'm free  
I believe in you and me  
  
I will never leave your side  
I will never hurt your pride  
When all the chips are down  
I will always be around  
Just to be right there where you are my love  
Oh I love you boy  
  
I will never leave you out  
I will always let you in  
To places no one's ever been  
Deep inside can't you see  
I believe in you and me  
  
Maybe I'm a fool  
To feel the way I do  
But I would play the fool forever  
Just to be with you forever  
  
I believe in miracles  
Love's a miracle  
And baby you're a dream come true  
I was lost now I'm free  
I believe in you and me  
I was lost now I'm free girl  
I believe in you and me

You are the flame in my heart  
You light my way in the dark  
You are the ultimate star  
You lift me from up above  
Your unconditional love  
Takes me to paradise  
I belong to you  
And you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
You make me feel so divine  
Your soul and mind are entwined  
Before you I was blind  
But since I've opened my eyes  
And with you there's no disguise  
So I could open up my mind  
I always loved you from the start  
But I could not figure out  
That I had to do it everyday  
So I put away the fight  
Now I'm gonna live my life  
Giving you the most in every way  
I belong to you  
And you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
Oh I belong to you  
I belong to you  
And you, you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
Oh I belong to you  
I belong to you  
And you, you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  
Oh I belong to you  
I belong to you  
And you, and you  
You belong to me too  
You make my life complete  
You make my life complete  
You make me feel so sweet  

Lost touch with my soul  
I had no where to turn  
I had no where to go  
Lost sight of my dream,  
  
Thought it would be the end of me  
I thought I'd never make it through  
I had no hope to hold on to,  
I thought I would break  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
And I crashed down, and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didn't know my own strength  
  
Found hope in my heart,  
I found the light to life  
My way out the dark  
Found all that I need  
Here inside of me  
  
I thought I'd never find my way  
I thought I'd never lift that weight  
I thought I would break  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
And I crashed down, and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didn't know my own strength  
  
There were so many times I  
Wondered how I'd get through the night I  
Thought took all I could take  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
And I crashed down, and I tumbled  
But I did not crumble  
I got through all the pain  
  
I didn't know my own strength  
Survived my darkest hour  
My faith kept me alive  
I picked myself back up  
  
Hold my head up high  
I was not built to break  
I didn't know my own strength  
  
I was not built to break  
I got to know my own strength

Share my life,  
Take me for what I am.  
'Cause I'll never change  
All my colors for you.  
  
Take my love,  
I'll never ask for too much,  
Just all that you are  
And everything that you do.  
  
I don't really need to look  
Very much further,  
I don't want to have to go  
Where you don't follow.  
I will hold it back again,  
This passion inside.  
Can't run from myself,  
There's nowhere to hide.  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't make me close one more door,  
I don't want to hurt anymore.  
Stay in my arms if you dare,  
Or must I imagine you there.  
Don't walk away from me.  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
If I don't have you, you, you, you, you  
  
You see through,  
Right to the heart of me.  
You break down my walls  
With the strength of your love.  
  
I never knew  
Love like I've known it with you.  
Will a memory survive,  
One I can hold on to?  
  
I don't really need to look  
Very much further,  
I don't want to have to go  
Where you don't follow.  
I will hold it back again,  
This passion inside.  
I can't run from myself,  
There's nowhere to hide.  
Your love I'll remember forever  
  
Don't make me close one more door,  
I don't want to hurt anymore.  
Stay in my arms if you dare,  
Or must I imagine you there.  
Don't walk away from me.  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
  
Don't make me close one more door,  
I don't want to hurt anymore.  
Stay in my arms if you dare,  
Or must I imagine you there.  
Don't walk away from me.  
No, don't walk away from me.  
Don't you dare walk away from me.  
I have nothing, nothing, nothing  
If I don't have you, you,  
If I don't have you, oh, ooo

Nothing is so good it lasts eternally  
Perfect situations must go wrong  
But this has never yet prevented me  
From wanting far too much for far too long  
Looking back, I could have done it differently  
Won a few more moments, who can tell?  
But it took time to understand the man  
Now at least I know, I know him well  
  
Wasn't it good, Wasn't it fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
But in the end, he needs a little more than before  
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
  
No one in your life is with you constantly  
No one is completely on your side  
And though I move my world to be with him  
Still the gap between us is too wide  
Looking back, I could have played it differently  
Learned about the man before I fell  
But I was ever so much younger then  
  
Wasn't it good (oh so good), Wasn't it fine (so fine)  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
  
Didn't I know how it would go  
If I knew from the start  
Why am I falling apart  
  
Wasn't it fine  
Isn't it madness he can't be mine  
But in the end, he needs a little more than before  
Security, he needs his fantasy and freedom  
I know him so well  
It took some to understand him  
Hoo ooh I know him so well

As I lay me down  
Heaven hear me now  
I'm lost without a cause  
After giving it my all  
  
Winter storms have come  
And darkened my sun  
After all that I've been through  
Who on earth can I turn to  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
After losing my breath  
There's no more fighting left  
Sinking to rise no more  
Searching for that open door  
  
And every road that I've taken  
Led to my regret  
And I don't know if I'm gonna make it  
Nothing to do but lift my head  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
And when all my strength is gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
Oh yeah  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
(my levies have broken, my walls have come)  
  
Coming down on me  
  
(crumbling down on me)  
  
All the rain is falling  
  
(the rain is falling, defeat is calling)  
  
Set me free  
  
(I need you to set me free)  
  
Take me far away from the battle  
I need you  
Shine on me  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
After all my strength has gone  
In you I can be strong  
  
I look to you  
I look to you  
  
And when melodies are gone  
In you I hear a song  
  
I look to you  
  
Yeah  
  
I look to you  
I look to you

I love the the Lord, he heard my cry  
And pitied every groan, long as I, I live  
And troubles rise, I hasten to his throne  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, I love the Lord  
I sure do, surely do love the Lord  
He heard, he heard my cry  
And pitied every groan, yes he did  
Every groan  
Long as I live, long as I, I live  
And troubles rise, troubles rise  
I hasten to to to to to  
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne  
I'll hasten to his throne hold on hold on  
Tears are streaming down my eyes  
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne  
  
Yes I will, I'll run  
I know I can go to his throne  
I know I can go, I know I can go  
I'll hasten, I'm gonna run  
I know I can go, I know I can go  
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his throne  
  
See I can run, Lord you know I will  
When there is nowhere to go I know I can go to you  
I know I can run to you oh  
I'll hasten, I'll hasten to his, his throne  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I'll hasten, hasten to his throne  
Surely gonna be here

Hey, oh, hey hey hey  
See I was born in Newark (sure was)  
  
We were always hand in hand  
He wore high top shoes and shirt tales  
Nip wore her pigtails  
I knew I loved him even then  
You know some disapproved it  
They even boo-hooed it  
But I told them time and time and time again  
  
You know I was made to love him  
Build my world around him and  
Hey, hey, hey  
He's been my inspiration  
Sho' nuff appreciation  
For the love I gave him through the years  
  
Like a sweet magnolia tree  
My love blossomed tenderly  
My love grew sweeter through the years  
  
I know my baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
That's why we made it through the years  
  
I was made to love him  
Worship and adore him, yes say  
Hey, hey, hey  
Hey, oh Lord  
  
All through thick and thin  
Our love just won't end  
But I love my baby, love my baby, oh  
  
My baby loves me  
My baby needs me  
I know I ain't going nowhere  
I was just a little thing  
The love bug hit me  
I had the fever with each passing year  
  
If all should tumble  
And the whole world crumble  
By his side I'll still be standing, yeah  
  
'Cause I was made to love him  
Made meant for him, say  
Hey, hey, hey  
I was made to love him  
Build my world all around him say  
Hey, hey, hey  
  
I love my baby  
Nip ain't' going nowhere  
Say hey, hey, hey

If I should stay, I'll only be in your way  
So I'll go, but I know I'll  
Think of you every step of the way  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
You, my darling you, hmmm,  
  
Bittersweet memories  
That is all I'm taking with me  
So, goodbye  
Please, don't cry  
We both know I'm not what you, you need  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
I hope life treats you kind  
And I hope you have all you've dreamed of  
And I wish to you, joy and happiness  
But above all this, I wish you love  
  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I, I will always love you  
  
You, darling, I love you  
Oh, I'll always, I'll always love you

Now tell me how you'd feel  
If I told you that I  
Have feelings for you  
And would it be so wrong to say  
What's on my mind  
I'm sorry I have to  
We were friends but with time  
What I feel inside for you has changed  
But I'd give up on love  
If I thought that it was untrue for you  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that  
I'll always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that  
  
I know that we're just friends  
But what if I decide to bring something in  
I hope it won't offend the trust  
We have cause I don't want this to end  
If you think that we'll lose what we have  
Then I'd just rather stay (rather stay) the same  
(I'd rather stay the same)  
'Cause I don't want to choose  
Between two of the most precious things to me  
(Tell me)  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that  
I'll always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that  
  
If we take this chance  
And extend to each other romance  
I hope it would be  
The right thing for you and me  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that  
I'll always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that  
  
Would you be there for me  
Could you dare to hold me  
Will my feelings leave me  
Lonely if I told you  
  
If I told you that  
I wanted to see you  
And if I told you that  
I'd beg to please you  
If I told you that  
I'll always keep you  
What would you say  
If I told you that

I'm dreaming tonight  
Of a place I love  
Even more than I usually do.  
And although I know  
It's a long road back  
I promise you  
  
I'll be home for Christmas.  
You can count on me.  
Please have snow and mistletoe  
And presents under the tree.  
Christmas Eve will find me  
Where the love-light gleams.  
I'll be home for Christmas  
If only in my dreams.  
  
Oh oh ah I'll be home for Christmas.

And presents under the tree.

Lying in a manger  
Away from harm and danger

To take our pain away

Go tell it on the mountain  
Shout it from a valley  
Tell about the baby in swaddling clothes

It's the second time around  
For you and I boy  
And believe me it's confusing me  
I'm afraid to say "let's make up" and "All's forgiven"  
But somethin' tells me it's heading for heartbreak  
So darling please I'm praying that  
This time yeah this time will be different  
That you and I can share this dream that I visualize  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it just the lonely talking again  
Are you really ready for love boy  
Or is it the lonely talking again  
  
Now the time before  
When we got together  
You promised you'd be forever true to me  
But all I got from you  
Was lots and lots of talking  
Lonely nights filled with misery  
  
So baby please please tell me now  
That when I fulfill your needs  
You won't up and leave me  
Even though you know  
I'll let you come back

Where we left off  
Before the day  
(The day, yeah)  
  
That I told you  
It was over  
Packed my things  
And moved away  
(Moved away)  
  
'Cause I see

That without you  
(Uh, huh)  
My world is just  
An empty place  
(Place)  
  
Taking one step away  
(Yeah)  
From you feels  
Like a million miles away  
(Yeah)  
  
'Cause it's  
A cold world

If you look into your heart  
With a positive mind  
Take some inventory of your woman and your glory  
Leave the bad things behind (ooh)  
Everybodys got a story (yes they do)  
About love and the good things  
But all the spices of your life  
You just got to pay the price  
If you know what I mean (ooh yeah)

I know how a girl becomes some pride  
When I finally found there was nothing left  
I said I do believe I found myself  
And I want to give it to you baby oh yes I do (yeah yeah)  
So if you look into your heart  
With a positive mind  
You can take some inventory of your woman and your glory

I know my man really needs me I say it  
What ever he want to do I want to do it with you baby (yeah yeah)  
(do do do doooo . . .)  
Jump on the night  
Love's not an easy game  
And he's strong and he's straight  
Now that I see  
What he's givin' me  
I say what ever he want to do  
I want to do it with you baby  
I'm loving you more and more and more and more  
And giving you all and all of me

Contact Contact  
Huh huh huh huh hoo huh yeah  
You've been avoiding me  
Like a cat trying to dodge a dog  
I never see ya shine  
You're as cold as the London fog  
You claim you want my love  
Well I wouldn't know by the way you behave  
If you want to feel the thrill of my touch  
You better come out of your cave  
  
It's so perplexing  
Why you fight it won't you try it  
Love's electric  
Turn me on and see  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is a contact sport  
You gotta move in time  
If you want to do it right  
Here I am  
Love is a contact sport  
You gotta act untamed  
If you want to play the game  
So grab my hand, SLAM!  
  
I hate to sound aggressive  
But I'm tired of waiting for your move  
Cut the formalities  
Cause you've got a few things to prove  
If you really want my love  
I need to feel it down deep from within  
Don't make me wait too long  
I'm ready now come and stroke my skin  
  
Well all this talking  
Worthless chatter just don't matter  
Time for stalkin'  
Come get next to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey boy,  
Why dontcha come on over  
So we can make that contact  
Contact you dare  
  
It's so perplexing  
Why you fight it won't you try it  
Love's electric  
Turn me on and see  
  
[Chorus]

Ah, ah, ah  
Things just ain't the way that they used to be  
Back in the day when a man meant security  
He'd be working hard all week  
Baby kick back and throw up your feet  
Let me fix you a treat  
So it might be love and sweet  
  
But he's worth it  
He deserves it  
May not be perfect  
But he's all the man I need  
He's ready and willing  
Gives me the feeling, ah  
And whenever we're together  
I know where I belong  
  
[Chorus]  
It's just the way he looks into your eyes  
Love that man  
It's the love he gives that makes you fantasize  
Love that man  
It's the time he takes to show you that he cares  
And he's always there (He's always always there)  
Don't you love that man (I know)  
  
Things they ain't the way they used to be  
When a woman and a man work hard to be  
Happy in love and stand together ooh  
(Let's stay that way forever)  
  
Never give in to a fight  
Just trying work it out  
Never give up on him  
That's not what love's about  
Stay true to your feelings  
And remember  
All the things he's done for you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You'd better know I'm talking about that old-school love  
That everlasting feeling can never be too much  
Somebody loves you heart and soul  
Hold on, don't stop  
And never let him go  
  
[Chorus]

Sometimes life can make you crazy  
It can really put a body to the test  
You try so hard to make sure everything is right  
And you find you've only wound up with a mess  
  
It's a common situation  
Even though you feel abandoned and alone  
Child, you ain't the first to experience a hurt so  
Don't panic when you bit the danger zone  
  
What you need's a little change of heart  
Forget this fear and frustration  
Love will always play the greater part  
When you battles wear you down  
Here's my advice  
  
When you're feeling down and out  
And you're got troubles on your mind  
Love will save the day  
When you're feeling full of doubt  
And fear has got you in a bind  
Love will save the day  
  
When your world's falling apart  
All you got to do is say a prayer  
And love will save the day  
There's answer in your heart  
So let your light shines, my dear  
And love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
Love will save the day  
  
Many things in this world bring you down  
It's a wonder you can make it through the day  
Well you can't sleep cause your problems are too deep  
And there's always something getting the way  
  
And when you turn on the evening news  
Mass confusion is the only thing you'll see  
Well there's no question  
That we need a new direction cause  
We all could use dome peace and harmony  
  
What you need's a little change of heart  
Forget this fear and frustration  
Love will always play the greater part  
When you battles wear you down  
Here's my advice  
  
When you're feeling down and out  
And you're got troubles on your mind  
Love will save the day  
When you're feeling full of doubt  
And fear has got you in a bind  
Love will save the day

I know, I cannot leave this place for the memories,  
Things like they way they knew us all over town  
We used to walk the streets together,  
We could be seen,  
  
Past shops where people knew us,  
Yeah, people knew.  
I've got to choose between tomorrow and yesterday,  
Can't stop to think about my life, here today.  
  
Memories can hang you up and haunt you,  
All your life, you know,  
Get so you cannot stay,  
And yet cannot go.  
  
Hey, I could find out where you've gone today,  
I feel so unhappy,  
Streets seem so empty now,  
I want you, I want you with me,  
  
Maybe I'll find someone to get you  
Off my mind  
Take me away from here and leave it, leave it all behind  
Oh, Memories can hang you up and haunt you  
  
All your life you know  
Get so you cannot stay and yet cannot go

Oh oh oh yeah  
Oh oh oh oh oh  
  
Came in the door  
Checked in my coat  
And who I'm looking for  
Is staring in my face  
  
They played our song  
We hit the floor  
He held me strong  
And we danced the night away  
  
I can see the way that he is making feel  
This way about his love  
I've been looking for something like this  
I'm saying ooh oh oh oh ooh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
If you go left right up down  
Make you spinning round and round  
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
It's been a long long time  
Since I fell, fell  
Love has found my way oh oh oh  
I've been looking (looking)  
I've been searching (searching)  
For the man to touch this place, oh ooh oh yeah  
  
Can't deny the way that he is making feel  
This way about his love  
I've been searching for something like this  
I'm saying oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say oh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If you feel good  
If you're feeling good  
Put one hand in the air, say yeah  
If you feel good  
If you're feeling good  
It's 'cause love is in the air  
Love is in the air  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
If he makes you feel like a million dollar bill  
Say oh oh oh, say oh oh oh!  
Makes you go left right up down  
Makes you spinning round and round  
Say ooh oh oh oh, say ooh oh oh oh!  
  
Come on and say...  
  
Come on and say...

(Clap your hands y'all, it's alright...)  
  
If tomorrow is judgment day (Sing Mommy)  
And I'm standing on the front line  
And the Lord asks me what I did with my life  
I will say I spent it with you  
  
If I wake up in World War III  
I see destruction and poverty  
And I feel like I want to go home  
It's okay if you're coming with me  
  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
  
If I lose my fame and fortune  
And I'm homeless on the street  
And I'm sleeping in Grand Central Station  
It's okay if you're sleeping with me  
  
As the years they pass us by  
We stay young through each other's eyes  
And no matter how old we get  
It's okay as long as I got you baby  
  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
  
If I should die this very day  
Don't cry, 'cause on Earth we weren't meant to stay  
And no matter what the people say  
I'll be waiting for you after the judgment day  
  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us  
'Cause your love is my love  
And my love is your love  
It would take an eternity to break us  
And the chains of Amistad couldn't hold us

One night not long ago  
I fell for you  
Too easy to let go  
She was one from your past  
One of the few  
You said it didn't last  
  
Now Romeo you know I can't believe  
Your tongue would slip so easily  
I know you think I oughta let it be  
But get it right, next time  
That's the end of me  
  
[Chorus]  
My name is not Susan  
So watch what you say  
If you still need her  
Then be on your way  
Don't want to hear about Susan  
She's got nothin' on me  
So show some respect for the love you receive  
My name is not Susan  
(No, no, no, no, no, get it right)  
  
Last night you were asleep  
Deep in a dream  
I heard you call her name  
Then you turned to embrace  
I froze in place  
Never to be the same  
  
Now Romeo you know I never knew  
My heart would bust so easily  
I know you think I oughta let it go  
But get it right next time  
Say good-bye to me boy  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never want to be the girly that you "call" one and only  
You know the kind of girly that you would call when you get lonely  
I never should have let you in,  
A damn shame, forgot my name!  
Well, anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't want to hear about Susan  
My name ain't Susan  
My name ain't Susan  
My name ain't Susan  
Ya better get it right!

O come o come Emanuel  
And ransom captive Israel  
That mourns in lonely exile here  
Until the Son of God appears  
Rejoice! Rejoice!  
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel  
(Bumm, bumm, bumm, bumm)  
Ah well, ooh  
(Bumm, bumm, bumm)  
Ooh  
O come, Desire of nations, bind  
Bind as one the hearts of all mankind  
Bid Thou our sad divisions cease  
And be Thyself our King of peace  
(Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)  
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel  
(O Israel, come to thee)  
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)  
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel  
(O Israel, come to thee)  
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)  
Emanuel shall come to thee, o Israel  
(O Israel, come to thee)  
Rejoice! (Rejoice!) Rejoice! (Ooh)  
Emanuel shall  
(Shall come)  
He's gonna come o Israel  
(Shall come)  
Don't you worry, God's gonna be there  
(Emanuel shall come)  
Emanuel, He's gonna come  
O Israel  
Ooh yeah  

The day you held me in your arms  
I still smell the scent of you  
On my dress unbelievable  
You were so masculine  
The way I felt your chest up next to mine  
I felt you in my heart  
And now I breathe love  
  
You are so amazing  
Unbelievable baby  
It's you that makes me smile  
When everything is crazy  
You're the one I love  
No other man can faze me  
'Cause you're in my heart  
I'm your heart  
Every minute daily  
  
Yes  
  
The time you looked into my eyes  
I felt like falling in love  
And I was mesmerized  
'Cause it's something that you do  
That makes me feel this way  
And I can't explain  
You're my joy, my peace, my happiness  
And you  
  
You are so amazing  
Unbelievable baby  
It's you that makes me smile  
When everything is crazy  
You're the one I love  
No other man can faze me  
'Cause you're in my heart  
I'm in your heart  
Every minute daily

Each day I live  
I want to be  
A day to give  
The best of me  
I'm only one  
But not alone  
My finest day  
Is yet unknown  
  
I broke my heart  
Fought every gain  
To taste the sweet  
I face the pain  
I rise and fall  
Yet through it all  
This much remains  
  
I want one moment in time  
When I'm more than I thought I could be  
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away  
And the answers are all up to me  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm racing with destiny  
Then in that one moment of time  
I will feel  
I will feel eternity  
  
I've lived to be  
The very best  
I want it all  
No time for less  
I've laid the plans  
Now lay the chance  
Here in my hands  
  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm more than I thought I could be  
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away  
And the answers are all up to me  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm racing with destiny  
Then in that one moment of time  
I will feel  
I will feel eternity  
  
You're a winner for a lifetime  
If you seize that one moment in time  
Make it shine  
  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm more than I thought I could be  
When all of my dreams are a heartbeat away  
And the answers are all up to me  
Give me one moment in time  
When I'm racing with destiny  
Then in that one moment of time  
I will be  
I will be  
I will be free  
I will be  
I will be free

I'm here alone on a Friday night  
Waiting here beside the phone  
The TV, radio and me  
Really ain't been getting along  
  
I wish that I could fly away  
And party till the break of day  
And there I'd be sure to meet  
The guy that would be special to me  
  
Then mama comes and asks me  
Why am I dreaming sitting alone?  
Why not go out and have some fun  
It's the only way I'll ever find  
Someone for me  
While I am young and seventeen  
  
[Chorus]  
Someone for me  
Someone for me  
I've got to go find someone, someone  
Someone for me  
I've got to find someone, yeah!  
  
Now here's a party down at Angie's house  
With people packed against the wall  
I'm sitting in the corner here  
Trying to make some sense of it all  
  
And when I least expect it  
Meeting the guy I see in my dreams  
Here he is walking up to me and asking  
If I'd like to come and dance with him  
I think I've found someone for me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And so I'm finding out that dreams you believe in  
Can come to be  
And now I'm looking up to find the joy and happiness  
Can come to you and me  
At last I've found someone for me  
  
[Chorus]

Well there's a bridge and there's a river that I still must cross  
As I'm going on my journey  
Oh, I might be lost  
  
And there's a road I have to follow, a place I have to go  
Well no-one told me just how to get there  
But when I get there I'll know  
'Cause I'm taking it  
  
[Chorus]  
Step by step, bit by bit,  
Stone by stone (yeah), brick by brick (oh, yeah)  
Step by step, day by day, mile by mile (ooh, ooh, ooh)  
  
And this old road is rough and ruined  
So many dangers along the way  
So many burdens might fall upon me  
So many troubles that I have to face  
  
Oh, but I won't let my spirit fail me  
Oh, I won't let my spirit go  
Until I get to my destination  
I'm gonna take it slowly 'cause I'm making it mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say it, baby, don't give up  
You got to hold on to what you got,  
Oh, baby, don't give up,  
You got to keep on moving on don't stop (yeah yeah).  
I know you're hurting, and I know you're blue,  
I know you're hurting but don't let the bad things get to you.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(C'mon baby got to keep moving),  
I'm taking it step by step), bit by bit,  
Stone by stone (yeah, stone by stone), brick by brick  
C'mon baby,  
Step by step keep on moving, day by day (day by day-ee),  
Mile by mile by mile by mile,go your own way,  
C'mon baby got to keep moving, bit by bit (bit by bit, bit by bit)

Oh baby oh baby yeah yeah yeah  
Such a pleasure loving you  
It's all mine  
  
I feel better knowing you  
Ooh you've got me thinking  
It's better to give and take  
I don't have to beg you too  
You're so good to me  
Carries me from day to day  
I appreciate the things you do  
Ooh but there's one thing I had to tell you boy  
I dig your actions  
But a lot of things you say  
  
I listen to the things you say  
Who you're calling me oh oh  
I listen to the things you say  
To me baby  
In a poem on a card  
Serenade my heart  
I listen to the things you say  
Who you're calling me oh oh  
I listen to the things you say  
To me baby  
In a card of a song  
Say my name please  
  
Lovely letters come at times I know I don't deserve it  
Any weather you'll come through  
Ooh you've got me gleaming  
I feel more than I worth  
You're my treasure  
I'll take you  
Over anything  
That's pleasing on this earth  
I appreciate the things you do  
But there's one thing I had to tell you boy  
I dig your actions  
But I love your words  
  
[Chorus]  
Every word that you say  
Makes a day much brighter  
Melody that you play  
I hear by the way and the love is lighter  
Speak to me  
  
[Chorus]

Huh, huh ooh I'm just a fool for you  
Huh huh huh huh  
I can't get you off my mind  
No matter what I do  
I'm wishing you were here with me  
Makes no difference (when it is)  
I only think of you  
And I'm living out my fantasy  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)  
It's still the same  
Nothing's changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
I'm just your fool insane (I'm just a fool)  
  
[Chorus]  
I keep thinking about you baby  
Oh so tell me what ya gonna do  
Got me thinking about you  
All I want to do  
  
Like a river of wine  
Intoxicate my mind  
I'm thinking about you  
That's what I want to do  
Pick me up, let's go down  
I'm thinking about it too (yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah)  
I'm thinking about you  
Got me thinking about you  
I'm thinking about it too  
  
Make believing is a game  
That's not for me to play  
Don't you need me just like I need you  
There's no reason  
Just my heart that makes me feel this way  
And I hope you feel the same way too  
  
Late at night I run to you  
Being such a lovesick fool  
It might be pouring rain (it will be pouring)  
It's still the same  
Nothing's changed  
All in all I feel no shame  
I'm just your fool insane (I'm just a fool)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It might be pouring rain  
Like a fool insane  
I'm just a lovesick fool  
I got this thing for you (I'm just a I'm just a lovesick fool)  
Oh just a fool for you!  
  
[Chorus]

Unidentified male intro:  
It's time for you to strike back  
They're lookin' at you  
Whitney Houston  
Muhammad 2 G  
They're watching your every move  
  
[Whitney:]  
Bobby  
  
Unidentified male:  
They're watching you  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why you lookin' at me  
Don't get mad at me  
'Cause I'm still gonna be me  
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)  
Whatchulookinat  
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)  
Whatchulookinat  
I feel your eyes on me  
You been telling lies on me  
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)  
Whatchulookinat  
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)  
  
See I don't understand  
Why you keep peepin' me  
When you don't even like me  
You're after me and my man  
Don't think you're stressing me  
'Cause your lies don't excite me, no no  
  
(Never thought)  
Never thought, Never thought  
(Never knew)  
Never knew that you would do this to me  
Do this to me  
(Try to ruin me) Ruin me  
(Be my enemy) Be my enemy  
(Never thought)  
Never thought, Never thought, Never thought  
(That you) That you  
Would act as if you're cool with me  
So why you lookin' at me  
  
Why you lookin' at me  
(Don't get mad at me)  
Don't get mad  
('Cause I'm still gonna be) Gonna be me  
(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)

(Tell me, Tell me, Tell me)  
Whatchulookinat  
  
Oh you know you're wrong  
Don't want to respect my song  
But it's okay 'cause either way  
My following is real strong  
You try so hard to show the whole world what I do  
Now I'm turning the cameras back on you  
Same spotlight that once gave me fame  
Trying to dirty up Whitney's name  
  
(Never thought)  
Never thought, Never thought, Never thought  
(Never knew)  
Never knew that you would do this to me  
Do this to me  
(Try to ruin me) Try to ruin me

Never thought, Never thought, Never thought  
(That you) That you  
Would act as if you're cool with me  
Why you lookin' at me  
  
[Chorus (2x)]  
Messing with my reputation  
Ain't even got no education  
Trying to mess with my concentration  
Don't even have a clue of what I'm facing  
All you know you need to stop it  
Defaming my name for a profit  
God is the reason my soul is free  
And I don't need you looking at me  
  
[Chorus (2x)]

I know it's been some time  
But there's something on my mind  
You see, I haven't been the same  
Since that cold November day  
We said we needed space  
But all we found was an empty place  
And the only things I learned  
Is that I need you desperately  
  
So here I am  
And can you please tell me, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love that's waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Won't they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care, for me  
  
I've been around enough to know  
That dreams don't turn to gold  
And that there is no easy way  
No you just can't run away  
And what we have is so much more  
Than we ever had before  
And no matter how I try  
You're always on my mind  
  
So here I am  
And can you please tell me, oh  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love that's waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Won't they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care for me  
  
And now that I am here with you  
I'll never let you go  
I look into your eyes  
And now I know, now I know  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love that's waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Won't they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care  
  
Where do broken hearts go  
Can they find their way home  
Back to the open arms  
Of a love that's waiting there  
And if somebody loves you  
Won't they always love you  
I look in your eyes  
And I know that you still care for me, for me  
You still care for me

I saw the news this morning  
And saw your face across the screen  
And as I poured my coffee,  
I picked up a magazine  
  
[Chorus]  
But as I turned the page  
And looked inside  
There you were again (there you were)  
Oh these lonely times  
They never seem to end  
You're too far  
I know I should be there where you are  
  
Today I did some shopping  
Just had to clear my mind again  
I can't stop thinkin' bout you  
I hopped into a taxi  
In a moment I was home  
Home again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tossing and turning in my sleep  
I can't take being without you  
I'm gonna catch the next plane out  
I got to get to where you are  
No matter how near or far  
I got to get there where you are  
I know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I want to be where you are  
I need to be where you are  
I want to be I want to be baby  
You know I need to be  
I know I should be there where you are

Mommies and daddys always believe  
That their little angels are special indeed  
And you could grow up to be anything  
But who would imagine a king  
  
A shepherd or teacher is what you could be  
Or maybe a fisherman out on the sea  
Or maybe a carpenter building things  
But who would imagine a king  
  
It was so clear when the wise men arrived  
And the angels were singing your name  
That the world would be different 'cause you were alive  
That's what heaven stood to proclaim  
  
One day an angel said quietly  
That soon he would bring something special to me  
And of all those wonderful gifts he bring  
  
Who would imagine, who could imagine  
Who would imagine a king  
  
Mommy

Why does it hurt so bad  
Why do I feel so sad  
Thought I was over you  
But I keep crying  
When I don't love you  
So why does it hurt so bad  
I thought I had let you go  
So why does it hurt me so  
I gotta get you outta my head  
It hurts so bad  
Oh it hurts so bad baby  
  
My life's been better  
Since the day I left you boy  
I must admit life's been kind to me  
I went and did the things I said I would boy  
I found someone who loves me for me  
Haven't had much drama since the day that we split boy  
My heart's never been more at ease  
And when I think of all the things you put me through  
Leaving you has been the best thing for me  
  
So why does it hurt so bad  
Why do I feel so sad  
I thought I was over you  
But I keep crying  
When I don't love you  
So why does it hurt so bad  
Baby I thought I had let you go  
So why does it hurt me so  
I gotta get you outta my head  
Hurts me so bad  
Hurts so (yeah you do)  
Hurts so (hurts me so)  
Hurts so bad (did you know)  
Hurts so (that it hurts me so)  
Hurts so (so bad, hey hoh)  
  
"Never again" that's what I said to myself  
I never want to feel kind of pain again boy  
Just when I think it's over  
Just when I think it's through  
I find myself right back in love with you  
  
So why does it hurt so bad oh baby  
Why do I feel so sad  
(thought I thought I) Thought I was over you  
I keep crying  
When I don't love you (when I really don't love you boy)  
(oh no oh no oh no oh no it hurts so bad, oh tell me)  
So why does it hurt so bad  
I thought I had let you go (thought I could let you go)  
You could  
Gotta get you outta my head  
Boy you hurt me so bad  
Hurts so (yeah you do)  
Hurts so (hurt me so)  
Hurts so bad (hurts so)  
Hurts so (sure you did)

Hurts so bad (hurt me so, gotta shoop now)  
Hurts so bad (Hurts me so)  
Oh why, you hurt me so bad  
Bad (how 'bout that?)

I found out what I've been missing  
Always on the run  
I've been looking for someone  
  
Now you're here like you've been before  
And you know just what I need  
It took some time for me to see  
  
That you give good love to me, baby  
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands  
You give good love to me,  
Never too much  
Baby, you give good love  
  
Never stopping I was always searching  
For that perfect love  
The kind that girls like me dream of  
  
Now you're here like you've been before  
And you know just what I need  
It took some time for me to see  
  
That you give good love to me, baby  
So good, take this heart of mine into your hands  
You give good love to me,  
Never too much  
Baby, you give good love  
  
Now I've stopped looking around  
Each night, what this life's all about  
Our love is here to stay, to stay  
Baby, you give good love  
  
So good  
Take this heart of mine  
Into your hands  
You give good love to me  
Never too much  
No, no, no, no, no  
You give good love to me  
So good, so good  
  
You give me good love  
Good love, good love  
Yeah you do  
You know what I need

So many nights I sit by my window  
Waiting for someone to sing me his song  
So many dreams I kept deep inside me  
Alone in the dark but now  
You've come along  
  
And you light up my life  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
  
Rollin' at sea, adrift on the water  
Could it be finally I'm turning for home?  
Finally, a chance to say hey,  
I love you  
Never again to be all alone  
  
'Cause you  
You light up my life  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
  
And you  
You light up my life  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
With song  
You give me hope  
To carry on  
You light up my days  
And fill my nights with song  
  
It can't be wrong  
When it feels so right  
'Cause you  
You light up my life, my life, my life, my life oooh

We all want to make a place in this world  
We all want our voices to be heard  
Every one wants a chance to be someone  
We all have dreams we need to dream  
Sweeter than any star you can reach  
'cause when you reach and find, you've found someone  
You'll hold this world's most priceless thing  
The greatest gift this life can bring  
Is when you look back and know  
You were loved  
  
[Chorus]  
You were loved by someone  
Touched by someone  
Held by someone  
Meant something to someone  
Loved somebody  
Touched somebody's heart  
Along the way  
You can look back and say (mm)  
You were loved (yes you were)  
  
You can have diamonds in your hands  
Have all the riches in the land  
But, without love,  
You don't really have a thing, no no  
When somebody cares that you're alive  
When somebody trusts you with their life  
That's when you'll know (huh)  
That you have all you need  
You'll hold this world's most priceless gift  
The finest treasure that there is  
You can look back and know  
You were loved  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So many roads that you can take  
Whatever way you go  
Don't take that road alone  
It's better you should know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So remember to tell that special one (yeah, mm)  
You were loved  
You were loved  
You were loved  
You were loved  
Hey hey hey hey hey

On the day that you left me  
You said you had no regrets  
There's a bond between us  
That hasn't been broken yet  
And the feelings between us  
Will never disappear  
How can you be far away  
When your spirit's here  
  
[Chorus]  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
We still belong together  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Our love will last forever  
  
And the seasons of our love  
Will always change I know  
Maybe that's the reason  
You felt we had to go  
But soon you'll be missing me  
Darling I know you well  
There's a magic we share together  
And no one can break that spell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll wait for you  
The thought that keeps me going each day  
Is I believe you still love me  
I love you more than words can say  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're still my man  
Nothing's gonna change it  
Don't you know, you oughta know we belong together  
You're still my man  
And nothing can change it  
Oh baby oh darling you're in my heart forever  
'cause you're my man  
Without you  
Darling, our love at all  
  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Don't you know you oughta know we belong together  
Oh You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Oh baby oh darling you're in my heart forever  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
I'm yours, you know you're mine  
You're in my heart forever  
  
You're still my man  
Nothing can change it  
Don't you know you ought to know we belong together  
You're still my man
