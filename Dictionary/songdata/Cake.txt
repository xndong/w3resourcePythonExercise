Don't you know I've seen it all before  
She'll hang the baskets on the walls  
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer, come fall  
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor  
  
He'll go to buy her Turtle Wax  
But in his mind, he won't be coming back  
She'll hang the baskets on the walls  
But I've seen it all before, heard the slamming of the door  
Come summer, come fall  
Come winter, there'll be baskets on the floor

Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Where's the air?  
Where's the air?  
Where's the, where's the, where's the air?  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I was in that Mercedes Benz  
Sealed away from my scents  
I'd have the music high going ninety five  
Too much too much too much too much  
  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear  
Don't you care?  
Don't you care?  
Don't you, don't you, don't you care?  
After car after bus after car after truck  
After this my lungs will be so fucked up  
I wish I wasn't just a pedestrian  
Breathing all this in  
I look up at that grey sky  
It makes me want to (oh)  
Too much too much too much  
Too much carbon monoxide for me to bear.

You need to straighten your posture and suck in your gut.  
You need to pull back your shoulders and tighten your butt.  
Yeah come Comanche Comanche Comanche commode.  
If you want to have cities you've got to build roads.  
You need to find some new feathers and buy some new clothes.  
Just get rid of the antlers and lighten your load.  
Yeah come Comanche Comanche Comanche commode.

We are building a religion  
We are building it bigger  
We are widening the corridors  
And adding more lanes  
  
We are building a religion  
A limited edition

To resist it is useless

His cigarette is burning  
But he never seems to ash  
  
He is grooming his poodle  
He is living comfort eagle  
You can meet at his location  
But you'd better come with cash  
  
Now his hat is on backwards  
He can show you his tattoos  
He is in the music business  
He is calling you "DUDE!"  
  
Now today is tomorrow  
And tomorrow today  
And yesterday is weaving in and out  
  
And the fluffy white lines  
That the airplane leaves behind  
Are drifting right in front  
Of the waning of the moon  
  
He is handling the money  
He is serving the food  
He knows about your party  
He is calling you "DUDE!"  
  
Now do you believe  
In the one big sign  
The double wide shine  
On the boot heels of your prime  
  
Doesn't matter if you're skinny  
Doesn't matter if you're fat  
You can dress up like a sultan  
In your onion head hat

When your castles turn to sand  
  
Take a bite of this apple

Take a walk through the jungle  
Of cardboard shanties and tents  
  
Some people drink Pepsi  
Some people drink Coke  
The wacky morning DJ  
Says democracy's a joke  
  
He says now do you believe  
In the one big song  
He's now accepting callers  
Who would like to sing along  
  
He says, do you believe  
In the one true edge  
By fastening your safety belts  
And stepping towards the ledge  
  
He is handling the money  
He is serving the food  
He is now accepting callers  
He is calling me "DUDE!"

A mirror image of a silver sky,  
Nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky  
Do you remember now, the oblivion of youthful minds,  
Caught up in the fashions of their time...  
Roll away,  
I can see that clearly now, every time I look into this  
Mirror image of a silver sky,  
Nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky  
What would they say?  
God is here in this country by the sky  
A mirror image of a silver sky,  
Nests of pines and brandy wines, build this country to the sky  
Piecemeal of yesteryear,  
A stained glass moment marking time,  
With full intent on my 22 year old mind  
Roll away,  
I can see that clearly now,  
Every time I look into this mirror image of a silver sky,  
Nests of pines and brandy wine, build this country to the sky  
What would they say?  
God is here in this country by the sky  

Cool blue reason empties on the page  
Your colleagues are in prison and your enemies in reign  
Cool blue reason comes into your world  
There's two more dead in Texas and it's probably your girls  
Cool blue reason wraps around your throat  
The minutes change like seasons  
Only eight more hours to go  
  
Cool blue reason comes into your life  
There's one more dead in Kansas and it's probably your wife  
Cool blue reason I'm just talking to myself  
Cool blue reason I'm just rearranging Hell  
I'm just talking to myself

Cool blue reason wraps around your throat  
The minutes change likes seasons  
Only eight more hours to go  
Only eight more hours to go  
Only eight more hours left to go

When you tried to kiss me  
I only bit your tongue.  
When you tried to get me together  
I only came undone.  
When you tried to tell me  
The one for me was you,  
I was in your mattress back in 1982.  
  
Daria, I won't be soothed.  
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,  
Smoothed over like milk,  
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,  
Icing on a cake,  
Or a serene translucent lake.  
Daria, Daria, Daria,  
I won't be soothed.  
I won't be soothed.  
  
When you tried to tell me  
Of all the love you had,  
I was cleaning oil from beaches  
Seeing only what was bad.  
When you tried to feed me  
I only shut my mouth.  
Food got on your apron  
And you told me to get out.  
  
Daria, I won't be soothed.  
Daria, I won't be soothed over like,  
Smoothed over like milk,  
Silk, a bedspread, or a quilt,  
Icing on a cake,  
Or a serene translucent lake.  
Daria, Daria, Daria,  
Daria, Daria, Daria,  
Daria, I won't be soothed.  
I won't be soothed.

Excuse Me, I Think I've Got A Heartache  
From Wheels-EP (iTunes exclusive)  
  
They just don't know how lost I feel without you  
My teardrops never see the light of day  
I laugh and joke and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth I'd have to say...  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
There's an aching deep inside  
And it just won't be denied  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
And I'd better say goodbye  
Before I cry  
  
I guess it's pride that makes me hide my sorrow  
I live a lie in all I do and say  
My lips may lie and paint a bright tomorrow  
But if I told the truth I'd have to say...  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
There's an aching deep inside  
And it just won't be denied  
  
Excuse me, I think I've got a heartache  
And I'd better say goodbye  
Before I cry

We know of an ancient radiation  
That haunts dismembered constellations  
A faintly glimmering radio station  
While Frank Sinatra sings "Stormy Weather"  
The flies and spiders get along together  
Cobwebs fall on an old skipping record  
  
Beyond the suns that guard this roost  
Beyond your flowers of flaming truth  
Beyond your latest ad campaigns  
An old man sits collecting stamps  
In a room all filled with Chinese lamps  
  
He saves what others throw away  
He says that he'll be rich someday  
We know of an ancient radiation  
That haunts dismembered constellations

It's three o'clock in the morning  
Or maybe it's four.  
I am thinking of you  
Wondering what I should do  
  
But I'm finally cutting through this haze.  
It's four o'clock in the morning  
Or maybe it's five.  
I think I'm alive  
  
And I think I'll survive.  
I'm finally cutting through this haze of love.  
Haze of love.  
For days and days and days  
  
I'm in a haze of love.  
Yeah you don't love me like I love you.  
All though you pretend,  
I can see this will end.  
  
I'm finally cutting through this haze of love.  
Haze of love.  
For days and days and days,  
I'm in a haze of love.  
  
It's five o'clock in the morning,  
Or maybe it's six.  
I am sick of your lies.  
I am sick of your tricks.  
  
I'm finally cutting through this haze of love.  
Haze of love.  
For days and days and days,  
For days and days and days,  
  
For days and days and days,  
I'm in a haze of love.

I bombed Korea every night.  
My engine sang into the salty sky.  
I didn't know if I would live or die.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
Red flowers bursting down below us.  
Those people didn't even know us.  
We didn't know if we would live or die.  
We didn't know if it was wrong or right.  
I bombed Korea every night.  
And so I sit here at this bar.  
I'm not a hero.  
I'm not a movie star.  
I've got my beer.  
I've got my stories to tell,  
But they won't tell you what it's like in hell.  
Red flowers bursting down below us.  
Those people didn't even know us.  
We didn't know if we would live or die.  
We didn't know if it was wrong or right.  
We didn't know if we would live or die.  
I bombed Korea every night.

At first I was afraid  
I was petrified  
I kept thinking I could never live without you  
By my side  
  
But then I spent so many nights  
Just thinking how you've done me wrong  
I grew strong  
I learned how to get along  
  
And so you're back  
From outer space  
I just walked in to find you  
Here without that look upon your face  
  
I should have changed my fucking lock  
I would have made you leave your key  
If I had known for just one second  
You'd be back to bother me  
  
Well now go,  
Walk out the door  
Just turn around  
Now, you're not welcome anymore  
  
Weren't you the one  
Who tried to break me with desire?  
Did you think I'd crumble?  
Did you think I'd lay down and die?  
  
Oh not I,  
I will survive  
Yeah  
As Long as I know how to love,  
  
I know I'll be alive  
I've got all my life to live  
I've got all my love to give  
I will survive,  
  
I will survive  
Yeah, yeah  
It took all the strength I had  
Just not to fall apart  
  
I'm trying hard to mend the pieces  
Of my broken heart  
And I spent oh so many nights  
Just feeling sorry for myself  
  
I used to cry,  
But now I hold my head up high  
And you see me  
With somebody new  
  
I'm not that stupid little person  
Still in love with you  
And so you thought you'd just drop by  
And you expect me to be free  
  
But now I'm saving all my lovin'  
For someone whose lovin' me  
Well now go,  
Walk out the door  
  
Just turn around  
Now, you're not welcome anymore  
Weren't you the one  
Who tried to break me with desire?  
  
Did you think I'd crumple?  
Did you think I'd lay down and die?  
Oh not I,  
I will survive  
  
Yeah  
As long as I know how to love,  
I know I'll be alive  
I've got all my life to live  
  
I've got all my love to give  
I will survive,  
I will survive  
Yeah, yeah  
Oh no

I can't believe it's true, I can't believe that you  
Don't want me anymore  
You're with him and you don't even know  
  
That I've been dying all day long  
And singing sad, sad songs  
And wishing you were gone  
  
Ha, is this love?  
Oh, is this love?  
Is this love?  
Or should I close the door?  
  
Yea, my eyes are burning in my head  
And seeing only red  
And wishing you were dead  
  
Is this love?  
Oh, is this love?  
Is this love?  
Oh, no is this love? I don't thing so  
Is this love?  
Or should I  
Or should I, should I  
Should I close the door?  
Should I close the door? Aah, I fooled myself  
Yea, alright, okay  
  
Is this love? Tell me  
Is this love? I don't thing so  
(Is this love?)  
Is this love?  
Oh, no is this love?  
Is this love?  
Or should I  
Or should I  
Or should I, should I  
Should I close the door?

Instead of her hips  
When she talks she moves her mouth  
Instead of her lips  
  
And I've waited for her for so long  
I have waited for her for so long  
I've wondered if I could hang on  
I wonder if I could hang on  
  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said  
Let me go and I will want you more  
Let me go, let me go  
Let me go and I will want you  
  
When she wants, she wants the sun  
Instead of the moon  
When she sees, she sees the stars  
Inside of her room  
  
And I've waited for her for so long  
I have waited for her for so long  
I've wondered if I could hang on  
I wonder if I could hang on  
  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said  
Let me go and I will want you more  
Let me go she said let me go  
Let me go and I will want you  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said  
Let me go she said let me go  
Let me go she said  
Let me go let me go  
Let me go let me go  
Let me go let me go  
Let let me go...  

Long Line Of Cars  
  
There's a long line of cars  
  
And they're trying to get through  
  
There's no single explanation  
  
There's no central destination  
  
But this long line of cars  
  
Is trying to get through  
  
And this long line of cars  
  
Is all because of you  
  
You don't wonder where we're going  
  
Or remember where we've been  
  
We've got to keep this traffic  
  
Flowing and accept a little spin  
  
So this long line of cars  
  
will never have an end  
  
And this long line of cars  
  
Keeps coming around the bend  
  
From the streets of Sacramento  
  
To the freeways of L.A.  
  
We've got to keep this fire burning  
  
and accept a little gray  
  
So this long line of cars  
  
Is trying to break free  
  
(drawn out words)  
  
And this long line of cars  
  
Is all because of me  
  
This long line of cars  
  
Long line of cars  
  
Long line of cars  
  
Long line of cars  

I don't want to wonder if this is a blunder  
I don't want to worry whether we're going to stay together till we die  
I don't want you jumping unless this music's thumping  
All the dishes rattle in the cupboards when the elephants arrive  
  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you, love you, love you madly  
  
I don't want to fake it, I just want to make it  
The ornaments look pretty but they're pulling down the branches of the tree  
I don't want to think about it, I don't want to talk about  
When I kiss your lips I want to sink down to the bottom of the sea  
  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you, love you, love you madly  
  
I don't want to hold back, I don't want to slip down  
I don't want to think back to the one thing that I know I should have down  
I don't want to doubt you, know everything about you  
I don't want to sit across the table from you wishing I could run  
  
I want to love madly  
I want to love you now  
I want to love you madly  
I want to love you, love you, love you madly

Dis empowered, the scattering flock  
Dances in a fever at the castle rock  
Dust-devil cypress and ripening fruit  
Ascending quick into the author's bathroom  
Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire  
Lettuce-toothed junkies all full of desire  
Meanwhile, Rick James takes her nude

And there's nothing I can say to you  
I've got a lot of work to do  
I guess I'll leave it up to you  
Uninvited, we'll stay if we want  
Searching through your closets for your grandfather's gun  
We will swim in your kidney, kidney-shaped pool  
Scratching at the bottom for another clue, yeah  
Fawn, Jo and Tootsie are out on a wire

I had a match  
But she had a lighter  
I had a flame  
But she had a fire  
I was bright  
But she was much brighter  
I was high  
But she was the sky  
  
Oh baby  
I was bound for Mexico  
Oh baby  
I was bound to let you go  
  
I don't know much about Cinco de Mayo  
I'm never sure what it's all about  
But I say I want you  
And you don't believe me  
You say you want me  
But I've got my doubts  
  
Oh baby  
I was bound for Mexico

Birds fall from the window ledge above mine.  
  
Then they flap their wings at the last second.  
  
You see birds fall from the window ledge above mine.  
  
Then they flap their wings at the last second.  
  
I can see their dead weight  
  
Just dropping like stones  
  
For small loaves of bread  
  
Past my window all the time.  
  
But unless I get up  
  
Walk across the room  
  
And peer down below  
  
I don't see their last second curves  
  
Toward a horizontal flight.  
  
All these birds just falling from the ledge like stones.  
  
Now due to a construct in my mind  
  
That makes their falling and their flight  
  
Symbolic of my entire existence,  
  
It becomes important for me  
  
To get up and see  
  
Their last second curves toward flight.  
  
It's almost as if my life will fall  
  
Unless I see their ascent.

Launching loony thoughts into the bending of your mind  
You reach for something high but it's a mountain that you find  
He's a king dust demon with an icepick smile  
His music fills your feathers as you feel your passions fly  
  
With the mustache man on the carpet of his van  
You can feel your fatty tissues giving way to sweaty hands  
And the woofers keep distorting and the tweeters kiss the girls  
His horn-rimmed glasses lights a square beneath his curls  
  
I have wasted so much time  
I have wasted so much time  
  
He is like a politician who is practicing a speech  
He is racing, he is pacing, he is sleeping on his beat  
As the sky begins to darken and the waves begin to roll  
  
You can feel the oceans rising as you're losing all control  
  
And meanwhile back at the Candlerock Lounge  
It is past 11: 30 and your friends are getting down  
They're applying purple eyeshadow, drinking warm beer  
They're wondering where you went to when you told them you'd be here  
  
I have wasted so much time  
I have wasted so much time  
  
I have wasted so much time  
I have wasted so much time

You look so good to me right now...  
You really, really look good to me right now...  
  
Whatever, whatever  
Girl I'll do,  
Forever and forever, ya ya ya ya  
I'll see you through  
Because I've got to keep you pleased, in every way I can  
I'm gonna give you all of whom, as much as you can stand  
I'll make love to you right now, that's all I want to do  
I know you need it girl, and you know I need it too  
  
'Cause, I've found what the world is searching for  
Here, right here, my dear, I don't have to look no more  
And all my days, I've hoped and I've prayed  
For someone just like you to make me feel the way you do  
I'm never gonna give you up  
No I'm never ever gonna stop  
Stop the way I feel about you

'Cause I found  
What this world is searching for  
Here, right here, my dear

And all of my days  
I hoped and I prayed  
For someone just like you  
To make me feel the way you do

I'm never ever gonna quit  
'Cause quittin' just ain't my shtick

I need your arms around me  
I need to feel your touch  
I need your understanding  
I need your love so much  
  
You tell me that you love me so  
You tell me that you care  
But when I need you (baby)  
Baby, you're never there  
  
On the phone  
long, long distance  
always through such strong resistance  
First you say you're to busy  
I wonder if you even miss me  
  
Never there  
You're never there  
You're never ever ever ever there  
  
A golden bird that flies away  
A candle's fickle flame  
To think I held you yesterday  
Your love was just a game  
  
You tell me that you love me so  
You tell me that you care  
But when I need you (baby)  
Baby  
  
Take the time to get to know me  
If you want me why can't you just show me  
Well, always on this roller coaster  
If you want me why can't you get closer  
  
Never there  
You're never there  
You're never ever ever ever there  
Never there  
You're never there  
You're never ever ever ever there

No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
Ringing stinging  
  
Jerking like a nervous bird  
Rattling up against his cage  
Calls to me throughout the day  
See the feathers fly  
  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone No phone  
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today  
  
Rhyming chiming got me working all the time  
Gives me such a worried mind  
Now I don't want to seem unkind  
But god (it's such a crime)  
  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
  
Shaking quaking  
Waking me when I'm asleep  
Never lets me go too deep  
Summons me with just one beep  
The price we pay is steep  
I've been on fire  
And yet I've still stayed frozen  
So deep in the night  
My smooth contemplations will always be broken  
My deepest concerns will stay buried and unspoken  
  
No I don't have any change but here's a few subway tokens  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone No phone  
No phone no phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone no phone  
No phone No phone I just want to be alone today  
No phone No phone

Ok  
  
Alright  
  
Uh huh  
  
This one  
  
This one  
  
This one  
  
Heads of state who ride and wrangle  
  
Who look at your face from more than one angle  
  
Can cut you from their bloated budgets  
  
Like sharpening knives through Chicken McNuggets...  
  
Now Heads of state who ride and wrangle  
  
Who look at your face from more than one angle  
  
Can cut you from their bloated budgets  
  
Like sharpening knives through Chicken McNuggets...

Now, now, learn to buck up  
  
Ah  
  
Alright  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Ah  
  
Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers  
  
Will eat your children and steel your thunder  
  
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl  
  
Will crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels  
  
Now nimble fingers that dance on numbers  
  
Will eat your children and steel your thunder  
  
While heavy torsos that heave and hurl  
  
Will crunch like nuts in the mouths of squirrels  
  
SHUT THE FUCK UP!! Now, SHUT THE FUCK UP!!  
  
Right now learn to buck up  
  
Right, shut the fuck up, heeeey hoooo  
  
Ya, ya, ya, learn to buck up  
  
Now clever feat that flicker like fire  
  
And burn like candles in smoky spires  
  
Do more to turn my joy to sadness  
  
Than somber thoughts of burning planets  
  
Now clever feet that flicker like fire  
  
And burn like candles in smoky spires  
  
Do more to turn my joy to sadness  
  
Than somber thoughts of burning planets  
  
Alright  
  
Ok  
  
I don't want to  
  
I don't want to hear it  
  
That's right  
  
Oh no

I don't want to  
  
I don't want to  
  
Heeeey hoooo  
  
I don't want to  
  
I don't want to

She's writing she's writing she's writing a novel  
She's writing she's weaving conceiving a plot  
It quickens it thickens you can't put it down now  
It takes you it shakes you it makes you lose your thought  
But you're caught in your own glory  
You are believing your own stories  
Writing your own headlines  
Ignoring your own deadlines  
But now you've gotta' write them all again.  
  
[Chorus:]  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you [Repeat: x2]  
You want her, confront her, just open your window  
Unbolt it, unlock it, unfasten your latch  
You want it, confront it, just open your window  
All you really have to do is ask  
But you're caught in your own glory  
You are believing your own stories  
Timing your contractions  
Inventing small contraptions  
That will roll across your parlor's hardwood floors  
  
[Chorus[  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you [Repeat: x2]  
You think she's an open book  
But you don't know which page to turn to  
Do you [Repeat: x3]

Last night I said to her  
I didn't want to live inside a lie  
If she wants him more than she wants me  
Let this be  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back  
All day I wait and wait  
To hear her footsteps on my walkway  
She never came  
She never even called  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back  
Somehow I know it won't last  
Somehow I know it won't last too long  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back to me  
She'll come back

I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you  
  
I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you  
  
I want to fly away  
I want to fly away  
  
I'm so sick of work  
so sick of play  
I don't need another day  
  
I'm so sick of work  
so sick of play  
I don't need another day  
  
I need to fly away  
I need to fly away  
  
Every shiny toy  
That at first brings you joy  
Will always start to cloy and annoy  
  
Every camera every phone  
All the music that you own  
Won't change the fact you're all alone (All alone!)  
  
Every piece of land  
every city that you plan  
will crumble into tiny grains of sand  
  
Every thing you find that at first gives you shine  
always turns into the same old crime (Same old crime!)  
  
I want to fly away  
I want to fly away  
I need to fly away  
I need to fly away  
  
(I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you)  
(I'm so sick of you  
so sick of me  
I don't want to be with you)  
  
Every little dance  
Every hidden back romance  
All alone (All alone!)

The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year  
And something in my mind just got away  
Being in the places where we used to be  
Somehow being there without you's not the same.  
  
Parking lots, office parks and shopping malls  
And all you left were bills you hadn't paid.  
The winter's chill chilled me to the bone this year  
And something in my mind just got away  
  
It's all behind you now,  
You're moving on.  
They'll never find you now,  
You're moving on, on, on.  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
  
Alcohol, cigarettes and luxury goods,  
Christmas lights look desperate in this room.  
Winter's light left me in the dark last night  
And Jingle Bells are smothered in this gloom.  
  
Winter's trees freezing in the bitter wind  
And autumn's leaves have all been blown away.  
Being in the places where we used to be  
Somehow being there without you's not the same.  
  
It's all behind you now,  
You're moving on.  
They'll never find you now,  
You're moving on, on, on.  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
  
It's all behind you now,  
You're moving on.  
They'll never find you now,  
You're moving on, on, on.  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah, naa

Well there is no such thing as you  
It doesn't matter what you do  
The more you try to qualify  
The more it all will pass you by  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
  
Well the more you try to shave the cat  
The more the thing will bite and scratch  
Its best I think to leave its fur  
And to listen to its silky purr  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
  
Well there is no such thing as you  
It doesn't matter what you do  
The more you try to qualify  
The more it all will pass you by  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is  
Some people like to make life a little tougher than it is

Up so close I never get to see your face.  
Microscope I might as well be out in space.  
Up so close I never get to see the view.  
Down your throat I'm never sure if it's still you.  
  
Up your nose down to your toes.  
In your mouth way down south.  
Up so close it seems I only think of you.  
Up so close I never see the sky so blue.  
  
I only wanted to be sure  
That what it was was really pure.  
I put my face down in the cake.  
My feet were flailing in a lake.  
  
Up so close, I never get to see your face.  
Microscope, I might as well be out in space.  
Up so close, I never get to see you.  
Microscope, I'm never sure if it's still you.

So we think that we're important  
And we think that we make sense  
And we think there's something better on the other side of this fence  
And you can soak your bread in gravy  
You can soak your bread in soup  
But the car that you are driving doesn't really belong to you  
So you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting  
For someone else to call  
Yeah you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting  
I say always be waiting  
  
And you can soak your bread in water  
You can soak your bread in wine  
It can seem like you are living like you're having a real good time  
And you can do it to your conscience  
You can do it all the time  
You can do it with a vengeance in the morning after nine  
But you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting for someone else to call  
Yeah you know you'll always be waiting  
Always be waiting  
I say always be waiting  
I say always be waiting

You should've told me when it all began  
You should've told me long ago  
Someday I know you're gonna find  
Just one mistake is not enough to change my mind  
  
What's now is now  
And I'll forget what happened then  
I know it all  
And we can still begin again  
  
And if the doubting faces made you go  
It's only mine that matters now  
Those looks will soon begin to fade  
If you come back and show them all you're not afraid  
  
What's now is now  
And I'll forget what happened then  
I know it all  
And we can still begin again  
  
Now that you know how much I understand  
You have no reason to be gone  
And if you feel at all like me  
Just let me know, I'll make it like it used to be  
  
What's now is now  
And I'll forget what happened then  
I know it all  
And we can still begin again  
What's now is now  
And I'll forget what happened then  
I know it all (I know it all)  
And we can still begin again  
What's now is now (now is now)

In a wooden boat in the shipping lanes  
With the freighters towering over me  
I can hear the jets flying overhead  
Making lines across the darkening sky  
  
And when the sun is going down I can take a taxi into town  
And the waiter at the restaurant sets a table just for one  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
  
So I had a plane to take me to a place so far away from you  
Eventually we began to see that we could be completely free  
And I could get away from you  
And you could get away from me  
And we could live each separately in our cities in the sun  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
  
In a CD karaoke bar  
By the banks of the mighty Bosphorus  
Is a Japanese man in a business suit singing "Smoke Gets In Your Eyes"  
And the muscular cyborg German dudes dance with sexy French Canadians  
While the overweight Americans wear their patriotic jumpsuits  
  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
(Spinning round)  
  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round spinning round  
Wheels keep on spinning round spinning round and round  
(Spinning round)  
  
(I don't know)  
Why you say you are not in love with me  
(I don't know)  
Why you say you are not in love with me  
(I don't know)

When you sleep.... where do your fingers go?  
what do your fingers know?  
what do your fingers show?  
where do your fingers go... yea  
  
when you sleep... do they tremble..on the edge.. of the bed  
or do you fold them... neatly.. by your head  
do they clench like claws against your own skin  
when youre living your day all over again  
  
When you sleep.... where do your fingers go?  
what do your fingers know?  
what do your fingers show?  
where do your fingers go... yea  
  
when you sleep... do they tremble..on the edge.. of the bed  
or do you fold them... neatly.. by your head  
do they clench like claws against your own skin  
when youre living your day all over again  
  
do they play guitar in a latin bar  
are they strangers or lovers, do they drive your car?  
are they swimming submissivly, sex acts of life  
or just cutting through jell-o with a very sharp knife  
now Zeus was a womanizer  
always on the lake  
but Hera usually punished her  
that Zeus was one to take  
  
when you sleeeeeeeeeeeeep  
where do your fingers go?  
  
Are they pulling out weeds form the dusty soil  
are they never rewarded fruits of the toil  
are they scratching their nails on the chalk boards of death  
only seeking attention when everyone in the room has left  
  
When you sleep.... where do your fingers go?  
what do your fingers know?  
what do your fingers show?  
where do your fingers go... yea  
  
when you sleep... do they tremble..on the edge.. of the bed  
or do you fold them... neatly.. by your head
