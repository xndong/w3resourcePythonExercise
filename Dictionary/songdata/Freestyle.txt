It's a can of gas-o-line  
Trapped in a s-ink  
And I think...  
Bad things are happen-ing  
And I just happen to think  
That someone's gonna grab it and fling  
It all over the napkins and the flammable rabbit mink  
After they drink  
It's gonna be on of those hazardous things  
Where people just sit back and laugh as it's happening  
I'm trapped by kin  
And hundreds  
Of bungee jumping  
Bad acting friends  
How can this be happening?  
  
That's just the first verse

Intro:  
Ngunit...  
Paano, nangyari na...  
May mahal ka nang iba...  
Naaalala pa  
Ang kahapon na  
Kay sarap at kay sigla  
Naglaho na lang bigla  
Akala'y ako lang  
Ang iniisip mo  
Ang iibigin mo  
Hanggang...  
Hanggang magpakailanman  
Refrain:  
Ngunit paano...  
Nangyari na may mahal ka nang iba...  
Pag- ibig kong ito'y  
Nilisan mo na...  
Chorus:  
Bakit Iniwan Na  
Ang puso kong ito  
Bakit Iniwan Na  
Ang pag-ibig ko sa'yo  
Malilimutan ba kaya kita sinta  
Anong nang gagawin ng puso  
Kong ito ngayong wala ka na  
Oh.. Uhhhhh  
Pinangarap na ikaw  
Makakasama ko  
Makakapiling ko  
Sa habang buhay  
Pag-ibig na tunay  
Binigay na ang lahat  
Lahat ng oras  
At ang pagmamahal sa'yo  
Para lamang sa'yo oh oh oh  
Refrain:  
Ngunit paano...  
Nangyari na may mahal ka nang iba...  
Pag- ibig ko sayo'y  
Nilisan mo na...  
Chorus:  
Bakit Iniwan Na  
Ang puso kong ito  
Bakit Iniwan Na  
Ang pag-ibig ko sa'yo  
Malilimutan ba kaya kita sinta  
Anong nang gagawin ng puso  
Kong ito ngayong wala ka na  
Bridge:  
Ang matatamis na mga ala-ala  
Nating dalawa  
Tanging yan lang  
Ang natitira.....  
Refrain:  
Ngunit paano...  
Nangyari na may mahal ka nang iba... Ohh  
Pag- ibig kong ito'y  
Nilisan mo na... Ohhhh ahhhhh  
Chorus:  
Bakit Iniwan Na  
Ang puso kong ito ohhhhhh...  
Bakit Iniwan Na  
Ang pag-ibig ko sa'yo  
Malilimutan ba kaya kita sinta ohhhhhhhhh...  
Anong nang gagawin ng puso ko...  
(ano nang gagawin ng puso ko)  
Ano nang gagawin ng puso kong...  
Ito ngayong...  
Wala...  
Ngayong wala ka na

(Freestyle)  
Bakit ngayon ka lang  
Bakit ngayon kung kelan ang aking puso'y meron nang laman  
  
(Pops)  
Sana'y nalaman ko na darating ka sa buhay ko  
Di sana'y naghintay ako...  
  
Bridge:  
  
Ikaw sana ang aking yakap-yakap  
(Ikaw sana ang laging yakap-yakap)  
Ang iyong kamay ang aking laging hawak  
(Kamay lagi ang aking hawak)  
At hindi kanya... (at hindi kanya)  
  
Chorus:  
  
Bakit ngayon ka lang dumating sa buhay ko  
(Bakit ngayon lang dumating sa buhay ko)  
Pilit binubuksan ang sarado ko nang puso  
(Pilit binubuksan ang aking puso)  
Ikaw ba ay nararapat sa akin  
(Ikaw ba ay nararapat sa akin)  
At siya ba'y dapat ko nang limutin  
(At siya ba'y dapat limutin)  
Nais kong malaman bakit ngayon ka lang dumating  
(Nais malaman bakit ngayon lang dumating)  
  
Repeat Bridge  
  
Repeat Chorus 2x  
  
Ooh... Nais kong malaman ba't ngayon ka lang dumating  
(Nais malaman bakit ngayon lang dumating)  
Oooh... Oooh

Baby give me a chance  
May I have this dance  
Don't make it the last  
Make it the first  
Pratically loved, always hated  
By jealous ones  
Just understand where I'm comin' from  
  
I was the one chosen  
I got my own destiny  
I need a route to find my life  
I just hope my life is 4 you  
I just need you next to me  
Or atleast for now 'til then listen  
  
Chorus: 2x  
When you look into my eyes  
Do you see my pain  
Our love is blind  
Still it can't see through anything  
  
I can't rap I can't think  
I'm a ghost in your mind  
I had a little 2 much 2 drink  
When I'm not with you  
I'm with another, what  
You thought I was goin' 2  
Be stuck on you  
I was but you let go  
Now we back together  
And It just isn't the same  
This love has changed  
  
Chorus: 2x  
When you look in my eyes  
Do you see my pain  
Our love is blind  
Still can't see through anything

I was not so happy being lonely living without you  
So I prayed so hard for your love in my heart I needed you  
Then I looked up in the sky and I'm thinking why oh why,  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
After all the caring and the laughter, no one is like you  
I am not a preacher with a sermon, I'm so in love with you  
'Cause to live without your love like the sun that shines above  
Is the magic of the changes in my life  
  
And I'll never forget your love  
You and I we were meant to be  
Sweet as rain falling from the sky  
You and I  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
Listen to these words I want to give you on our love so true  
Don't forget I love you and I need you, I'll always be with you  
So just looked up in the sky and you'll find out why oh why  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
And I'll never forget your love  
You and I we were meant to be  
Sweet as rain falling from the sky  
You and I  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes in my life  
  
(Instrumental)  
  
And I'll never forget your love  
You and I we were meant to be  
Sweet as rain falling from the sky  
You and I  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes in my life  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes  
These are all the many changes in my life.

I should have known you'd be this way  
Serves me right, to fall in love  
  
You brought me love then you took it back  
We had it all and that's a fact  
Love is a game that we all play  
There's one thing I've got to say  
I gave you my heart and I gave you my world  
I spent those lonley nights right here in the cold  
Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver  
All I want to do is love you all night long  
  
Chorus:  
Can't let you go my love  
It's you that I need  
You keep me wanting you  
You push my love aside  
Repeat (1x)  
  
I can't help but think of how you made me feel  
Everytime I think of the two of us  
Can't realize  
Can't realize  
Can't seem to buy it  
Now that you're gone  
Now that you're gone  
  
Chorus (2x)  
  
Can't let you go my love  
You fit me like a glove  
'Cause when you hold me tight  
The feelings oh so right  
Just can't foget those times  
When you were mine, all mine  
This love I have for you is true  
So come back to the one who loves you  
  
Can't let you go...  
Can't let you go...  
  
Everytime you touch me my body starts to quiver  
All I want to do is love you all night long...  
  
I should have known that you'd be this way  
Serves me right to fall in love  
I can't help but think how you left me feeling  
Everytime I think about the two of us  
Can't realize  
Can't seem to buy it  
Now that you're gone  
Now that you're gone  
  
Chorus (3x)  
  
I can't let you go

Mga pagkukulang sana'y hayaang mabawi  
Ika'y di na nais pang muling saktan  
Di ko maisip kung maari mo pang pagbigyan ang  
Pag-ibig na dati ay walang hanggan  
Ako ma'y manghinayang nagunit  
Nagsawa pagkukulang  
  
Paulit-ulit ka nalang lagi ng napapagod  
Huwag nang dagdagan ang mga pangko  
Sana'y maintindihan  
Di maamin kung kakayaning di na nga kailangan  
Ang pag-ibig na sa iyo'y nababalik  
Tuluyan na nga kaya baguhin na ang pagtingin sa pag-ibig  
Na dati ay walang hangganan  
  
Chorus:  
  
Tuluyan nang nagbabago  
Sana'y maunawaan mo  
Kahit may pag-ibig pa  
Di na nais makasasama ka hindi mababago  
Maghihintay lamang sayo  
Pag-ibig laan lamang sa iyo  
Pag-ibig ay di dapat ganito  
  
(repeat Chorus)

You, you keep on trying  
Trying to tear me apart  
and I knew from the very start  
that you, you steal my heart  
Because of you I'm crying  
I never know that you when you're lying  
What we have must be  
You can't hide what you really feel  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby  
  
Chorus:  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
  
You, you keep denying  
Denying that you really cared  
Stop, Stop Playing this game  
Show me your love is still there  
The love, the love I have inside me ever grows  
for ever stronger  
What we have must be  
You can't hide what you really feel  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby  
  
Chorus:  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Don't break my heart  
ohhh ohhh  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
Don't break my heart  
  
You had my heart  
Your my dream from the start  
You know I need you baby(you know I need you baby)  
You touch my soul  
Do you want me to go  
I thought I loved you baby(i loved you baby  
  
Chorus:  
So don't break my heart  
Finish what you started baby  
Don't break my heart  
I can't live without you  
Don't break my heart  
My love was so true baby

No I haven't slept a week at all  
Since you've been gone  
And my eyes are kinda tired  
From crying all night long  
No I've never been too good at cooking just for one  
It's so lonely here without you baby  
Come back home  
  
'Cause I'm half crazy  
Feelin' sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried you'd find someone else to love  
  
No life hasn't been much fun at all  
Since you've been gone  
And my eyes begin to fill  
Each time I hear our song  
I spent every minute asking myself  
What went wrong  
Can't we try to talk it over baby  
Come back home  
  
'Cause I'm half crazy  
Feelin' sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried you'd find someone else to love  
But baby there is no-one else  
Half crazy  
For everything you saying  
Half crazy  
No one else could love you like I do  
  
(Break)  
  
'Cause I'm half crazy  
Feelin' sorry for myself  
Half crazy  
Worried you'd find someone else to love  
But baby there is no-one else  
Half crazy  
For everything you saying  
Half crazy  
No one else could ever love you  
No one else could ever be  
  
Half crazy  
Feeling sorry for myself  
And I'm worried you'll find someone else  
Feeling sorry for myself  
Half Crazy (faded)

Ano pa kaya ang magagawa  
Ngayong wala ka na  
Habang ako ay nagiisa, nangangamba  
Paano na ang bukas ko  
Nasanay na sa piling mo  
  
Hanap ka  
At umaasa pang sana'y  
Muling makapiling ka  
At di na maalis ang nadarama  
At ipinagdarasal  
Na sana'y magbalik  
Wala nang mahihiling pa  
Kung maaari pang muling makapiling ka  
  
Hanggang ngayo'y nasa isip ko  
Ang kahapong kay saya  
Di maunawaan  
Kung bakit kinailangang ika'y mawala  
  
Paano na ang bukas ko  
Nasanay na sa piling mo  
  
Hanap ka  
At umaasa pang sana'y  
Muling makapiling ka  
At di na maalis ang nadarama  
At ipinagdarasal  
Na sana'y magbalik  
Wala nang mahihiling pa  
Kung maaari pang muling makapiling ka

[Chorus]  
It's automatic [Repeat: x4]  
  
Girl I can see right through your false defenses  
You act as if you can ignore the sound  
My force detectors tell me your pretending  
All of your systems are about to go down  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
If you can stand it, just dance  
I'm your mechanic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I know the secrets to your circuitry girl  
To your diskette I have to access code  
Don't try to fight this electricity girl  
From all this power you might overload  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
If you can stand it, just dance  
I'm your mechanic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Girl I can see right through your false defenses  
Before you know it, I will be in control  
My force detectors tell me your pretending  
Your force repellors can no longer hold  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
If you can stand it, just dance  
I'm your mechanic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's automatic baby  
It's automatic  
I realize baby  
All the things you fantasize baby  
It's in your eyes baby  
So let your body rock  
Shake that thing  
  
I'll make you wet baby  
I'll make you sweat baby  
I'm your best bet baby  
So let your body rock  
  
I know you feel it, just dance  
I know you feel it, romance  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I know you feel it, romance  
I know you feel it, just dance  
No need to panic, I know you feel it  
This automatic romance  
It's automatic, I know you feel it

Jealous  
nina  
  
Jealous of the girl who caught your eye  
one of my darker days  
when you look at her where was I  
should have been in her place  
here I am all alone imagining  
what might have been, could have been  
if had been there  
  
Jealous of the one  
Whose arms are around you  
if she's keeping you satisfied  
jealous of the one who finally found you  
made your sun and your stars collide  
la la la la la  
she's a very, very lucky girl  
  
Jealous of the girl  
who won your heart  
they say it's a perfect match  
She's gonna get to be where you are  
and it don'y get better than that  
she'll say you're fine  
whisper words I wish were mine  
and they might have been  
could have been  
if had been there  
  
And you know I'd fight the good fight  
if I thought I'd changed your mind  
but if she makes you happy  
then i'll leave the dream behind  
man, she better treat you right  
and give you everything  
cause the moment that she doesn't  
I'll be waiting in the wings

Honey why you calling me so late?  
It's kinda hard to talk right now.  
Honey why are you crying? Is everything okay?  
I gotta whisper 'cause I can't be too loud  
  
Well, my girl's in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
It's really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
It's funny that you're calling me tonight  
And, yes, I've dreamt of you too  
And does he know you're talking to me  
Will it start a fight  
No I don't think she has a clue  
  
Well my girl's in the next room  
Sometimes I wish she was you  
I guess we never really moved on  
It's really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
It's really good to hear your voice say my name  
It sounds so sweet  
Coming from the lips of an angel  
Hearing those words it makes me weak  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
And I never wanna say goodbye  
But girl you make it hard to be faithful  
With the lips of an angel  
  
Honey why you calling me so late?

I, believed in you  
Why'D you leave when you  
Said that you'D never let me go  
All I gave was love  
Wasn'T that enough  
Tell me the truth, I need to know  
Refrain  
I can say to myself, that I don'T need you beside me  
That I'Ve finally put it all behind me... but  
Chorus  
I'D only be lying to myself  
And I'D only be dreaming of what,  
I know would not come true  
Coz no matter what I do  
To try to think I'M doing well  
Reality is that I'M still not over you  
I, go, everyday  
Trying to find my way  
Drifting into the empty roads  
Cryin' every night  
These tears, so hard to fight  
What do I do, I just don'T know  
Refrain  
I can say to myself that I never needed you, anyway  
And after all, I'Ve nothing more to say...  
(Repeat chorus)  
Bridge  
I thought that it was never ending  
I thought that we were not pretending it was real  
I know my heart will soon be mending  
And after the rain, the sun will soon reveal...  
That I  
Chorus ii  
I have been lying to myself  
And I, I have been dreaming of what  
I thought would not come true  
I know after what I'M going through  
I will be doing well  
And when the day comes,  
I know what I'Ll say is true  
That reality is... I'M finally over you

Tonight is the night  
I'm gonna make this thing right  
Come closer come and hold me tight  
Feel the heat come rushin'  
For my body's yearnin'  
Can't you see,  
I want to be all that you need  
  
I just want to feel you  
How would I be touching you  
So just give me all you're lovin'  
Spend sometime with me  
On this lovely evening  
  
I want to make love with you  
Feel your arms like you want me to  
Holdin' you is what I want to do  
Just tell me when  
To get close enough to you  
To get close enough to you  
  
No need to worry  
It's just you and me baby  
Sit by my side  
There's no need to hide  
So close your eyes  
And don't think twice  
Feel my lips all over your cheeks  
C'mon break the ice  
  
I just want to feel you  
How would I be touching you  
So just give me all you're lovin'  
Spend sometime with me  
On this lovely evening  
  
I want to make love with you  
Feel your arms like you want me to  
Holdin' you is what I want to do  
Just tell me when  
To get close enough to you  
To get close enough to you

paano magagawa limutin ang sandali  
yakap kita sa king piling  
hanggang katapusan walang ibang sasabihin  
kundi -  
pag-ibig ko sa yo'y mananatili  
hindi magbabago,  
ito'y sa iyo lagi  
habang umiikot pa ang mundo  
iibig lang sa iyo  
pag-ibig ko'y mananatili...  
pinakatatangi at di ka maalis  
sa isip ko sa buhay ko  
wala nang makapagpapasigla sa buhay ko  
sana'y malaman mo na -  
pag-ibig ko sa yo'y mananatili  
hindi magbabago,  
ito'y sa iyo lagi  
habang umiikot pa ang mundo  
iibig lang sa iyo  
pag-ibig ko'y mananatili...

I've been through so much pain since you left me  
I just can't convince myself we're through  
Things have been said and done  
I guess it's over now you're gone  
  
It's true when they say that lovers come and go  
But deep in my heart I just want to let you know  
The love that we once shared is everything  
That there's nothing to compare  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
'Cause I'm missing you so bad  
Now that you're not by my side  
I guess you could say it's me  
Who's hurting so bad after all this time  
After all that we've been through  
Baby aren't you hurting too  
  
Now that I've lost the power to pretend  
I guess you could see right through me  
This yearning I can't explain  
Feeling I just cannot contain  
  
I know someday I'll get over you  
It just takes time and some getting used to  
Each day I'm feeling blue  
Every road leads me back to you  
  
'Cause I'm missing you so bad  
Now that you're not by my side  
I guess you could say it's me  
Who's hurting so bad after all this time  
After all that we've been through  
Baby I'm missing you so bad  
  
Now that you're not by my side  
I guess you could say it's me  
Who's hurting so bad after all this time  
After all that we've been through  
Baby aren't you hurting too

I everyone has A friend of their own  
Someone that we can look up to  
Mine is like no one I'Ve ever known  
He'S not like me, he'S not like you  
Ii while you and I climb the ladder high  
He looks into the horizon  
He asks me " boy, what are you tryin' to find? "  
Then I realize my journey'S just begun...  
Chorus I  
Everybody, say "Hello" to this friend of mine  
He'S standing here, right inside of me  
And everybody, he'S the one who'S always on my mind  
He'S somebody you don'T see...  
Iii knowing what'S good, and what is right from wrong  
He always seeks to find it  
The choice between coin and candy for the soul  
He needs nobody to remind him  
Iv he always packs his bag with honesty  
Specially to show to himself  
A tank-Full of courage and humility  
So he won'T get lost, tryin' to be somebody else  
Chorus ii  
Everybody, say " hello" to this friend of mine  
He'S standing here, right inside of me  
And everybody, he'S the one who'S always on my mind  
He'S somebody you don'T see...  
His name is mr. What- I - wanna - be  
His name is mr. What- I - wanna - be  
Bridge  
And the race goes on, and on, and on  
The race for truth in A world of lies  
Life is not just what we have known  
In A world full of blindness,  
Now I wanna see with both my eyes  
Repeat chorus ii  
Coda  
I am learning  
I am learning from someone  
Never stop learning  
Until he and I are one

Check it out, intro to tha third chapter,  
Which contains most violence to the O. C. Fuzed minds,  
With the transitional rhymes  
That'll bring physiological karma causin drama  
To you and your fuckin baby momma,  
It slides like this,  
  
Don't test me with your gay attitude  
Cuz nigga I aint feelin it  
Who the fuck do you assume your fuckin wit  
Manifest, discovered the G-E-O-are-G-E  
Bootleg crips and bloods trying to pull me down with gravity  
But what ya don't know is that I be fuckin ya'll spinal cord  
Out wit the radius frequency  
I hold a 5. 0 desert eagle and the homie, a double edged samuri sword  
Is what we be strap-a-lin an,  
Lame ass gangs is what we be slash-a-lin and clap-a-lin,  
(dj) fr, fr, erra, raa, erra, fresh out the fuckin boat  
Makin yo momma give us deep throat  
1 stroke she chokes  
Causin you to suffer a heightened awareness  
Outlaws around the corner writing you in our hit list  
Gomez Assasin obliterating all you bitches wit mad fists  
Handle the basic which need you to face it,  
At dark when you be sleepin  
That's when swoon be creepin  
Tearin off your arm like an alley cat  
Hangin you from the back so take that as a personal fact  
If it werent for fag ass laws  
The silent assasins be fuckin murderin yo foo's  
Swoon be readin the 4: 20 biblical verse  
Causing havoc on natures earth  
The only ones bringing killin to ya first  
Sparkin the bowl to burn  
50 caskets for you, tables are turned  
Gibs burst into pieces  
Charged with W-E-E-D  
As a result to your death  
J. B. G slices your body parts til nothings left  
So toon later for chapter four  
If your yearning for fuckin more!

Been thinking bout you baby  
And I don't know what to do  
All I think about is you  
Seems everything around me  
Things I've never understood  
They all make sense when I'm with you.  
  
Oh, I've heard it all before  
Finding so called love then you leave it behind  
But now I feel so sure  
I listen to my heart this time  
So I lay it on the line  
  
Chorus:  
  
I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime  
And I know there's no way out  
Cause it's once in a lifetime  
  
I've always been so lonely  
No one there for me to hold  
And every night was just so cold  
Oh don't get me wrong I've been around  
But I've resigned myself to thinking  
Mine is just another story often told  
  
Oh, I've heard it all before  
Finding so called love then you leave it behind  
But now I feel so sure  
I listen to my heart this time  
Put my heart before my mind  
  
Chorus:  
  
I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime  
And I know there's no way out  
Cause it's once in a lifetime  
  
Coda:  
  
It's not like I'm running out of time  
I'm taking everything in stride  
It's just I never thought I'd find  
What would make me change my mind  
  
Chorus:  
  
I know that what I've found is once in a lifetime yeah yeah  
And I know there's no way out  
Cause it's once in a lifetime  
  
Ohhhh... ohhhhh...

Yakap, yakap ko siya dahil  
Luha'why dagling dadaloy  
Ngunit paano, ko sasabihin ito  
Puso'why tiyak na masusugatan  
Kaya ba niya'ng maunawaan  
Pa'no ko sasabihin ito  
Ayaw ko mang saktan  
Ang kanyang damdamin  
Ngunit kailangan malaman  
Puso'why kumakaba  
Sana'why matapos na  
'Di makapag-umpisa  
Ngunit kahit nais ko mang pilitin  
'Di na kayang ibigin  
Pano'why ipadarama sa iyo sinta  
Na puso'why ari na ng iba (woo..)  
Labis, na pinagdaramdam  
Bakit sa 'kin pa manggagaling  
Paano ko sasabihin ito  
Ayaw k mang saktan  
Ang kanyang damdamin  
Ngunit kailangan malaman  
Puso'why kumakaba  
Sana'why matapos na,  
'Di makapg-umpisa, woo ..  
Ngunit kahit nais ko mang pilitin  
'Di na kayang ibigin  
Pa'nong padaram sa iyo sinta  
Na puso'why ari na ng iba (woo..)  
Paano, pa'no ko sasabihin  
Pa'no ko sasabihin (7x)  

I was born broke  
I be dam if I will ie that way  
I love my momma  
Can't deny that phase  
Every night I pray for a rap record deal  
Man, even some times twise I say  
Lord save me take me away from hell  
14 to 9 and I've been sellin ''yay'' for years  
Y we had a house and couldn't keep it  
Y I got more pink slips than victoria secret  
Y I gotta rob  
Y my pappi aint got a job  
Y I aint gradguate  
Y throught school I aint have a date  
Y I hade to masterbate

Everyday we go through different things  
We may not know what tomorrow may bring  
But I know that I'll be okay  
Baby come what may  
And everyone has their share of ups and downs  
Never so sure of what fate will allow  
But I know somehow we'll make it through  
Just me and you  
When it's time to cry we can cry together  
Know that I'll be with you,  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
I'll be right by your side  
Ooh  
I know that you have been hurt before  
Feelin' like you couldn't trust anymore  
But it's always good to know that  
There's someone there for you  
Although sometimes things may not turn out right  
I'll be right here, you don't have to hide  
Whatever you feel inside we'll make it through,  
Just me and you  
We'll share the laughter  
And you know we'll also share the tears  
And when times are bad  
Just know that I'll always be here...  
Just remember -  
When it's time to cry we can cry together  
Know that I'll be with you,  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
I'll be right by your side  
Ooh  
I'll never go away  
I will be right here beside you  
I'll be with you all the way  
And I'll be here to stay with you  
Come what may...  
Just remember -  
When it's time to cry we can cry together  
Know that I'll be with you,  
With you through whatever  
When the times get rough  
Know that I will be right by your side  
I'll be right by your side, ooh (repeat)  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side  
I will be right by your side (fade)

Nagsimula lang ang lahat sa isang tingin  
Mula noon napamahal na 'ko sa'yo  
Gabi-gabi nananalangin sa mga bituin  
Maramdaman mo sana...  
Maintindihan mo sana...  
Hindi na baleng hindi mo tanggapin  
Hindi na baleng di ka mapasakin  
Basta't malaman mo...  
Para sa 'yo lamang ang puso kong ito  
Magpakailan pa man asahan mo  
Para sa 'yo lamang ang puso kong ito  
Magpakailanman pa man  
Para sa 'yo... Oooh  
Pagkatagal-tagal ko nang naghihintay  
Baka sakaling kailangan mo ako.  
Hindi pa rin nagbabago hanggang ngayon  
Mahal pa rin kita  
Mahal pa rin kita...  
Hindi na baleng hindi mo tanggapin  
Hindi na baleng di ka mapasakin  
Basta't malaman mo...  
Para sa 'yo lamang ang puso kong ito  
Magpakailan pa man asahan mo  
Para sa 'yo lamang ang puso kong ito  
Magpakailanman pa man  
Para sa 'yo... Oooh

I've been with you boy, for 'years' is quite a while  
But getting to sensual is really not my style.  
You know I love you and I like it just like this.  
Sometimes I feel like giving you more than just a kiss.  
  
But baby it's wrong  
Baby it's not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now, our love will never be the same  
It won't be long. We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
But baby for tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's take it slow, so slow  
Anywhere you want to go  
Baby for you I'll lay it on the line  
You oughtta know (oughtta know), boy I ain't got no where to go I'll give it
to you, only to you  
We gotta take it real slow  
  
We got together you know I feel the fire.  
Burns up inside me, all the natural desire.  
I know that you feel it too. I know you want to flow.  
Dreaming about it and the fire starts to grow.  
  
But baby it's wrong  
Baby it's not my kind of game  
If I give it to you now, our love will never be the same  
It won't be long. We gotta play our love just right  
I know you know the time will come  
but baby for tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And know tomorrow it will still be you and me savin it all for you especially  
Trusting it baby when I say this to you if we wait a little longer our love
will be forever true.  
  
[Chorus]

  
Oh I'm sorry girl,  
For causing you much pain,  
Didn't mean to make you cry  
Make your efforts all in vain  
And I apologize  
For all the things I've done  
You were loving me so much,  
But, all I did was let you down  
  
Oh I really don't know  
Just what to say  
All I know is that  
I want you to stay  
  
Chorus:  
This time I'm not gonna  
Let you slip away  
This time I'm not gonna  
Let another day go by  
Without holding you so tight,  
Without treating you so right  
This time I'm not gonna  
Let go of your love  
This time I promise you  
That we'll rise above it all  
And I will never let you fall,  
I'm gonna give you my all,  
This time...  
  
Oh I never thought,  
That I was hurting you  
Now I know that I was wrong  
Now I know just what to do  
Gonna try to be  
The best that I could be  
All I need is one more chance  
To make it up to you, you'll see...  
  
And there's one more thing  
That you ought to know  
All I know is that  
I don't want you to go.....

I don'T wanna talk about it anymore  
As far as I'M concerned you'D best be out that door  
I'M tired of making things work out all by myself  
I suggest you go and find somebody else ooh...  
I thought I couldn'T live without you here with me  
Guess I was just A fool I was too blind to see  
Now I ain'T gonna make the same mistakes again  
Oh I can'T believe how hard it is for you to understand  
That to love me  
You gotta be true you'Ve gotta be true  
You'Ve got to know just what to say  
(can'T tell you what to do)  
You wouldn'T make me cry  
Wouldn'T hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
I remember when we used to talk (used to talk, and...)  
I remember when we used to walk (hand in hand)  
I'D see how much you love me when I looked into your eyes  
But now it seems like no matter what I do or say  
To try to show you how much I miss our yesterday  
I just can'T get through to you  
What I must do to make you realize  
That to love me  
You gotta be true you'Ve gotta be true  
Got to know just what to say (can'T tell you what to do)  
You wouldn'T make me cry  
Wouldn'T hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
Ooh... I wanna feel that way again  
Tryin' hard to fight the pain from deep within  
I don'T wanna let go after all that we'Ve been through  
But if you don'T feel the same anymore  
If you no longer love me like you did before  
Just tell me so I'Ll know what I'M supposed to do  
Save my heart for someone who...  
Someone who will love me  
Who'Ll always be true, who'Ll always be true  
Who'S gonna know just what to say  
Who'Ll always know what to do  
Who'Ll never make me cry  
Never hurt me this way  
It really is easy to love me  
Ooh I remember when you used to love me  
(You used to love me)  
Ooh... ooh...  
I remember mmmmm.

My baby I love you so much forever you and I  
I love you oh I love you so much forever you and I  
My baby I love you so much forever you and I  
I love you oh I love you so much forever you and I

You know today is a new day you see,  
  
I'll stab you the back and then sting like a bee,  
  
My ride be sit'n on some twenties,  
  
You thought you could battle me,  
  
While your ride sits on them little three's,  
  
Its like your jumping in the ring trying to box with Ali,  
  
Just stay in pee wees,  
  
You and all them are about same height I can see,  
  
You'll never be more then a shadow standing behind me
