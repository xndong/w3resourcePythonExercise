[Verse 1: Chris Brown]  
If you leave this time I fear that you'll be gone for good  
So I hold on like leaves and fall to what is left  
Said her father left her young and  
He said he'll be back with that same  
Tone that you just said you'll stay forever with  
  
[Chorus: Chris Brown]  
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling  
I feel like you're the only reason for it  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
It seems that you're the only reason for it  
  
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]  
I've been bleeding in your silence  
I feel safer in your violence  
I hold on like leaves in Fall to what is left  
Before I sleep I talk to God  
He must be mad with me, it's coming  
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with  
  
[Chorus: Chris Brown]  
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling  
I feel like you're the only reason for it  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
It seems that you're the only reason for it  
  
[Verse 3: Kendrick Lamar]  
So the iceberg never broke  
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it  
And I poke (and I poke) and I poked at it  
But it stayed stagnant then I poked at it some more (some more)  
And in my notepad, man I wrote (man I wrote)  
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it  
If it don't chip then a toe tag is, one last  
I'mma hope (I'mma hope) so iceberg don't float (don't float)  
If I do manage to do damage to you dammit  
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies or my granny still standing  
With a note (with a note) that read ''granted, don't you panic''  
When you make mistakes the most (the most)  
One day it'll make you grow (you grow)  
When you outlandish and you lose manners  
To God you shall consult (consult)  
When the bright cameras are still cramming  
In your face and it provoke (provoke)  
You to act mannish, just stay planted  
Cause you reaping what you sowed  
Keep positivity in your heart and (and)  
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and (and)  
When you get mad and when you poke at it  
When you poke it at just know, man  
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you re-new your vision  
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck you would do to a critic, my
nigga?  
Yeah, yeah, tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em lord?  
(Do you hear 'em lord? Do you hear 'em?)  
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?  
And they won't let me live even when remorse that I give  
When it gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive  
When they never see good in me  
Even though I got hood in me  
Don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord  
  
[Chorus: Chris Brown]  
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling  
I feel like you're the only reason for it  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do  
It seems that you're the only reason for it

Why you're up in here starting drama?  
Cutey got the bottie with a curve like coma  
We can disappear M.I.A until tomorrow

Feels like I should be throwin' hundred dollar bills when you pass me  
You know what's on my mind girl you don't got to ask me

Dj turn off what you're playing,

Because this girl means too much to me,  
And now we're on the floor and she's touching me.  
And if I wanna take her home  
It's gonna be better than what they do on the radio!

It's gotta be the loudest!  
It's gotta be the best song she ever heard!  
I gotta tell her how I feel,

And if you feel that way, go ahead and kiss your baby!  
And now we've got the whole stadium in love!  
  
Turn up the lights, give me a mic

Jump of the stage, crowd surfing all the way

And if you wanna get with me,  
Put your hands in the air show me that energy

[Verse 1: Tyga]  
I love women and power, we used to sit and talk for hours  
On the balcony, my condo play your favorite, shawty  
No love lost, just the perfect soulmate, that's all  
It's my fault, caught in a rupture  
Should've been you I was touchin', I knew it wasn't  
My ego, I was buzzin' but not how you wanted  
Too busy tryna flaunt it, like I just bought it  
You know them bitches 'round you can't hold water  
This s'posed to be our moment  
These pills set it, I'm feelin' better  
Called you to tell you I love you  
But you too busy with some other shit, I'm guessin'  
No texts, no proof, no voice messages  
How we become enemies so effortless?  
Or was I blind when you was naked?  
Or high when you was level  
Know time is of the essence  
No lie, I live and regret it  
Decisions I made, embedded in my mind  
Hate to admit it, but I gotta say it one time  
  
[Hook: Chris Brown]  
Should've treated you right  
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane  
I should've put my focus on you  
In the club every night  
I just get it wrong when you do right  
And I keep just fillin' your head with the lies  
This shit comes with a price  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you better  
A nigga should've loved you  
  
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]  
What happened to me, babe?  
This ain't who you fell in love with  
You say you need space  
Don't do this  
Just look at me, one more time  
I know I fucked up but I'm tryin' to please you  
I'ma give you all  
And your heartache and pain's gonna stop  
Baby right here  
Don't walk away  
There is no one left to call  
Don't wanna be alone when you disappear  
I know I hurt you more than three times  
Now you need me time  
Fuck I'm s'posed to do in the meantime?  
Then she told me "figure it out"  
  
[Hook]

Was it something I said?  
Was is something I did? Ohh,  
Looking for an answer cause I don't even know,  
Why are you so upset with me?  
Girl what is this about?  
Them other shawty's I don't care about,  
  
(Chorus)  
Baby sit down,  
Only when we sex is when I wanna hear you yelling out loud,  
Count down,  
Backwards from ten, now ain't that much better?  
Lay down every little word,  
She said this he said that,  
Don't believe none of them lies,  
Ohhhh,  
  
This damn time,  
Fightin' over shit that don't really matter,  
This chapter, started on a brand new chapter,  
I've never seen this type of thing before,  
I already know why the story unfolds,  
All I wanna do is love you right, take my time,  
Read between the lines girl,  
Read between the lines girl,  
  
Here we go again,  
Heard it all before,  
It's getting us know where fast,  
So let's retrace our steps,  
Figure out where we were,  
Ohh girl,

(Chorus)  
Baby sit down,  
Only when we sex is when I wanna hear you yelling out loud,  
Count down,

He be acting funny but he really doesn't need ya.

break.  
Giving your heart to him was a big mistake.  
Girl you really don't need him, what you see in him you need to fall back.  
Girl I can carry you, this time you're on your own but,  
What I could do for you, you won't be all alone.  
Now baby stop second guessing it, you've got a winner ain't no stressing it.

Baby there's no need to be naive, blindfolded.  
Girl you need to leave him, let him be.  
It's so sad to see that you can't see what's going on.  
Baby come with me, can't you see, blindfolded.  
Baby there's no need to be naive, blindfolded.  
Girl with me is where you need to be.

[Pre-Chorus]  
I was naked in the waves, you were laughing in the distance  
I was screaming out to you, but you never seem to listen  
We both set out to sink, we were rocking in the waves  
And you prayed my boat was sinking, you lead me to the grave  
  
[Chorus]  
And now there's blood on my, blood on my, blood on my hands

And that's why you know I'm gon' spoil and I'd do anything for you  
Need your hair done, I'd fix it, want a new bag, I'd get it  
Girl you look good, let me kiss you, I wanna spend this money up with you  
Pop a couple bands for the rent, take it, that's money well spent  
That's for all the money you spent, that's for all the money you lent me girl

[Verse 3]  
You are the reason why I don't fuck with you niggas  
Only the homies from day one

Name saved as bae in my phone  
Give her a minute, when she come over we kissing  
She my day one, only one better than all my bitches  
Pussy too good when I bang I'm on a mission  
Body to body when we changing up positions  
I'm like a prodigal, I pick her like eeny meeny miney mo  
Hop out the plane like Geronimo, I lock her down like Guantanamo  
I give that pussy a taste, put that shit all in my face  
She likes the Codeine and the J, baby girl all I can say  
  
[Chorus]  
You've been down for me  
Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And you've been riding for me girl

Since day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one  
And I love you for that, you're  
My day one, day one, day one, day one, day one, day one shawty

All the bullshit's for the birds  
You ain't nothin' but a vulture  
Always hopin' for the worst  
Waiting for me to fuck up  
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah  
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean  
When I tell her keep it drama free  
  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh (chu-chuckin' up the deuces)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I told you that I'm leaving (deuces)  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
I know you mad but so what?  
I wish you best of luck  
And now I'm 'bout to throw them deuces up  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm on some new shit  
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her (deuces)  
I'm moving on to something better, better, better  
No more tryin' to make it work  
You made me wanna say bye bye,  
say bye bye, say bye bye to her  
You made me wanna say bye bye,  
say bye bye, say bye bye to her  
  
Uh, use to be valentines  
Together all the time  
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie  
It's like I sent my love with a text two times  
Call 'cause I care but I ain't gettin' no reply  
Tryna see eye to eye but it's like we both blind  
Fuck it lets hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some  
  
'Cause when it's all said and done,  
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to  
I hate liars, fuck love I'm tired of tryin'  
My heart big but it beat quiet  
how never feel like we vibin'  
'Cause every time we alone it's a awkward silence  
  
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter  
And gimme back that ruby ring with the big diamond  
Shit is over, what you trippin' for?  
I don't wanna have to let you go  
But baby I think it's better if I let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look, my shorty always on some bullshit like Chicago  
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow  
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow  
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow  
The other chick I'm with never complainin'  
She make wanna leave the one I'm with Usher Raymond  
  
Probably didn't register, don't trip, later on it will  
Shorty full of drama like gangsta grizzles  
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me  
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me  
I got a new chick, and she ain't you  
She Paula Patton thick she give me deja Vu  
  
And all that attitude, I don't care about it  
But all that shit I do for her, you gon hear bout it  
Breezy rep two up, two down  
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Deuces

[Verse 1: Tyga]  
Ya'll know me, the still same OG, young T-Y-G  
Hated on by most these niggas  
But I still keep shittin' on niggas lowkey  
I don't fuck with you to the third degree  
I keep a G, DMV, you owe a three  
Schemin' on the low, tryna make a nigga profitly  
All I do is get money, fuck, and sleep  
I should run for mayor  
Been runnin' shit, you barely maintainin', bitch  
No, this ain't no (?) shit  
Break a neck on some Busta shit

I be on til infinity  
Don't predict, bitch, what I'm gonna do  
Cause chances are I've outdone you  
And most of my so called enemies  
Spit your game, talk your shit  
Grab your gat, call your clique  
Ball so hard I don't need the assist  
I'm the best so I keep that shit  
Nigga, you should too  
If you knew what this game'll do to you  
Look at bullshit that I've been through  
This the drive through and shit on you  
  
[Hook: Tyga]  
Don't get it fucked up  
Yesterday was the freshest nigga in America  
I swear to God I ain't lyin', bruh, I ain't lyin' bruh  
In America

I don't trust niggas, I only trust funds nigga  
  
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]  
Nowadays everybody wanna talk like they got somethin' to say  
But nothin' comes out when they move they lips  
This extended clip will make Buddha shit  
Shawty comin' and pullin' up with them hooter tips  
Never use a nigga, but she abuse the dick  
I let the pussy let the air drop  
We in a boat, nigga, right off the coast  
European or Caribbean, I'm sweatin' on hair dye  
So don't get it fucked up  
I got a handful of matches, fuckin' with a bad bitch  
All my niggas is savages, better loc up  
Damn ,it's a tragedy, all of these casualties  
Metal through his body, nigga, check his anatomy, oh shit  
Why you pillow talkin'? That's ho shit  
Nigga, you a geek, still talkin' 'bout me fucking yo' bitch  
I can't lie, can't lie

I believe I can fly, I'm the shit now  
Wanna be like Mike when I die  
Step right up, can't name any nigga that can fuck with us  
I'mma bring the pain, we gon' be the game-changers  
All in your face, I'm bustin' nuts  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse 3: Pusha T]  
Did ya'll think I would let my dough freeze?  
Ho, please! Better bow down on both knees  
Who you think taught you to throw P's?  
Who you think taught you to rap keys?  
Dress (?) Phillip Limb, SLP's  
Like Snoop D-O-double G  
Nigga murda was the case so motherfuck the police  
Ya'll niggas soft like Emojis, with the heart eyes  
Ya'll part skies, ya'll cloud killas  
We aimin' niggas, my soldiers blacker than apartheid  
We coupe niggas, you niggas riding four doors  
Like Uber nigga, we pilin' all of your whores  
On the canopy my stamina be  
Enough for Pamela Anderson Lee  
My Katy Perry ain't afraid to carry  
That shit you sniff, Taylor Swift  
Niggas talk yet it remains a myth  
I never seen it, they only dream it  
They rap about it, do interviews  
With they toy cars and they little jewels  
  
[Hook:]

I'm Starin At The Clock

[Verse 1]  
This time she's really out my life, oh  
I know I gotta get her back  
Just need one night to hit it right  
But I can't get her alone, no  
Know she deserves to up and leave  
If it was me I'd do the same  
I see that girl, know that she hopes  
So I'll be damned to let it go, damned to let it go  
  
[Chorus]  
I discover, discover I love her  
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh  
I discover, discover that I love her  
Ooh, that would get her back  
  
[Verse 2]  
I'm guessing this is where it ends (You don't even pick up for a nigga)  
I know she's calling all her friends (And they don't like me, fuck y'all
bitches)  
They probably tryna take her out (All up in the VIP so they can take a
picture)  
And tryna find her ass a man, shit, make a nigga mad  
Cause she know I'm hurting, she know that I'm hurting  
Yeah she know I care, she know that I care  
I can't understand, know I treat you bad  
But you don't get me back like that, no, no  
Oh, oh, I gotta get my baby, girl don't leave me  
All this crazy shit that you been dealing with it, you probably hate me, hey  
Cause baby if you cheated, I couldn't handle that  
To know that another nigga is making you smile like  
  
[Chorus]  
I discover, discover I love her  
Oh, I gotta get her back, woah yeah  
I discover, discover that I love her  
Ooh, that would get her back  
  
[Bridge]  
I can't breathe, yeah  
Can't breathe, can't breathe, yeah  
Girl let me breathe again, breathe again  
Let me breathe again, oh  
I can't breath, can't sleep  
Can't dream, so weak, girl  
Gotta get you back, gotta get you back  
Can't think, oh gee  
  
[Chorus]  
I discover, discover I love her  
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh  
I discover, discover that I love her  
Ooh, that would get her back  
  
[Outro]  
Get you back oh, get you back oh  
Can't think girl, oh gee oh, gee oh

I don't wanna go there  
We should never go there  
Why you wanna go there  
I guess I gotta go there  
You're hearing rumors about me  
And you can't stomach the thought  
Of someone touching my body  
When you so close to my heart  
I won't deny what they saying  
Because most of it is true  
But it was all before I fell for you  
  
So please babe  
So please don't judge me  
And I won't judge you  
'Cause it could get ugly  
Before it gets beautiful  
Please don't judge me  
And I won't judge you  
And if you love me  
Then let it be beautiful  
Let it be beautifu-u-ul , let it be beautiful  
Let it be beautifu-u-ul , let it be beautiful  
  
Everything I say right now  
Is gonna be use in another fight  
And I've been through this so many times  
Can we change the subject  
You gonna start asking me questions like:  
"Was she attractive, was she an actress ?"  
Baby the fact is, you're hearing rumours about me  
And saw some pictures online  
Saying things, they got you so angry  
Making you wish you were mine  
Before we start talking crazy  
Saying some things we'll regret  
Can we just slow it down and press reset  
  
You're beautiful  
So babe  
So please don't judge me  
And I won't judge you  
'Cause it could get ugly  
Before it gets beautiful  
Please don't judge me  
And I won't judge you  
And if you love me  
Then let it be beautiful  
  
Just let the past  
Just be the past  
And focus on things  
That are gonna make us laugh  
Take me as I am, not who I was  
I'll promise I'll be, the one that you can trust  
  
So please  
So please don't judge me  
And I won't judge you  
'Cause it could get ugly  
Before it gets beautiful  
So please don't judge me  
And I won't judge you  
And if you love me  
Then let it be beautiful  
Let it be beautifu-u-ul , let it be  
Let it be beautifu-u-ul , aye let it be beautiful, yeah yeah yeah

And the cheers over the years  
You stood by me you didn't doubt me

Plus I got my own movie now  
After all the awards  
That they gave me you still found me  
You didn't play me, you didn't doubt me  
Think you want some more

Dearly beloved  
If this love only exists in my dreams  
Don't wake me up  
  
Too much light in this window,  
Don't wake me up,  
Only coffee no sugar inside my cup,  
If I wake and you're here still, gimme a kiss,  
I wasn't finished dreamin' about your lips  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't wake me up, up, up, up, up, up

Been awake for some days now, no time to sleep,  
If your heart is a pillow, this love's the bed,  
Tell me what is the music inside my head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't wanna fall, fall, fall, fall asleep no,  
I don't wanna fall unless I'm falling for you

Got me out of that apartment

Believe... it's worth saving  
And to get lost  
Lost in a day dream  
So why hesitate  
Take me to another place  
So far far away  
So I can get out of the dark  
High speed  
Like I'm racing  
Just like lightning  
The sky is blazing

You've been lead astray  
Are there better days  
For My Fallen Dreamer

It don't get no better  
Than my tongue riding your letter  
Feeling you get wetter  
We'll be making love until the morning after  
And I can feel your thigh slowly rising  
As I'm sipping from your water fountain  
  
We gon' flood the bed  
Take it to the ground  
While I'm in your ocean baby  
Hold my head down, down, down  
  
[Hook:]  
I wanna drown in it, drown in it  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Just take me under  
Drown in it, drown in it  
Under your waters  
Drown in it, drown in it  
I will never come up, oh  
  
[Verse 2: Chris Brown]  
High heels in your red lips  
It's fair and high in here  
And I can see a million ways  
For me to surfboard between your waves, girl  
We be going up-down, all around, drip drop, don't stop  
No umbrella, playing in your rain  
Shawty, I'll be slashing in you deeper  
High draining, oh baby  
Come sit that body in my face  
  
[Hook:]  
I wanna drown in it, drown in it  
Drown in it, drown in it

You're screaming while I'm touching your spot  
Oh girl I got your water so high

[Verse:]  
I was at the mall on some back to school  
Tryna cop me a couple pairs of shoes  
And then I looked to my left  
And I lost my breath 'cause this girl was so fresh  
Really wasn't tryna intrude  
But she looked like the type I was into  
And I wanted to holla but she was wit her mama  
Felt like a catch 22  
Okay how should I step to her, (how should I step to her)  
Without any disrespect to her  
But I thought she would like  
If I kept it polite  
So I stepped and this is what I said to her  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me mamma (hey)  
Your daughters fine (your daughter's fine)  
And If I could I'd like a moment of her time (a moment of her time)  
While I was shopping I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine?  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Wishin I could catch her by herself  
Waitin til she wasn't with nobody else  
Now every time I saw her  
I was tryin to call her  
And she was busy checkin for the sales  
Part of me was like just let it go  
The other part of me was like let her know  
But I will never get this chance  
My life again gotta man up and tell her so  
  
[Hook:]  
Okay how should I step to her, (how should I step to her)  
Without any disrespect to her  
But I thought she would like  
If I kept it polite  
So I stepped and this is what I said to her  
  
[Chorus:]  
Excuse me mamma (hey)  
Your daughters fine (so fine, so finee, so fine)  
And If I could I'd like a moment of her time  
While I was shopping and I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine?  
  
(Breakdown)  
Baby don't you know that you  
Got me all up in the wrong store  
Now the malls bout to close  
Crazy, but I followed you  
'Cause I just couldn't take it no more  
No disrespect to your mama but I need that  
Number baby yeaa  
  
[Chorus: X2]  
Excuse me mamma (hey)  
Your daughters fine  
And If I could I'd like a moment of her time  
While I was shopping and I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine?  
Excuse me mamma (hey)  
Your daughters fine (your daughter's fine)  
And If I could I'd like a moment of her time  
While I was shopping and I saw her walking by  
So can I get her number and I'll give her mine?

Sometimes I don't wanna wake up alone  
But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own  
Sometimes I don't wanna walk by and smile  
But at the same time I don't wanna let people down  
  
Can you imagine, the weight of a world  
Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world  
And no-one can reach you, ooo ooo ooo  
So no-one can help you, nowwwww  
  
It's getting heavy I think I'm bout ready to break down  
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin down  
Time keeps on tickin on I wish there was a way to slow it down  
Someone pick me up, cause I'm fallin down  
I'm fallin down, down, down, down,  
Down, down, down, down  
I'm fallin down, down, down, down,  
Down, down, down, down  
  
Why is it so easy for you to blame  
I'm only human we're all the same  
I've given up everything in exchange for being alone  
I'm shaking these demons underneath all the pride, ohhhhhhhh  
  
Can you imagine, the weight of a world  
Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world  
And no-one can reach you, ooo ooo ooo  
So no-one can help you, nowwwww  
  
It's getting heavy I think I'm bout ready to break down  
I'm standing up, but I'm fallin down  
Time keeps on tickin on I wish there was a way to slow it down  
Someone pick me up, cause I'm fallin down

There's some problems going on with us, (Yea, you and I)  
And baby that's a problem I take real serious  
I can't lie  
It gets to me  
I don't know what to do but to tell you that I love you  
And you know this cause I show it  
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen No  
  
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business  
In other words  
They don't know half of what I go through  
(To give) give you what you need  
(To be there) to be there for you and still do my thing  
I'm talkin' bout music  
Cause it's what I gotta do to express how I really feel  
See you write the song girl and I just do the singing  
Without you I can't live  
So heart to heart  
  
[Chorus:]  
Baby heart to heart  
(Baby you're) You're the biggest part of my needs, girl  
They can tell their stories  
What you do for me  
It gets too deep, girl  
  
What I'd do for you  
You'll never know  
What they say to you  
Girl let him go (You don't need him)  
You don't need him  
You'd be better off hanging out with me  
They try to break us up  
They don't understand our love cause it gets to deep, girl  
  
Check  
I know a way to make a bunch of people love me  
If you were to leave me all by myself  
Soon as we turn our way back they hustle out  
To tell someone else what's going on  
Misery likes company but we're the only company  
We need to be happy  
And you know this cause I show it  
Outsiders try to blow it but I can't let it happen No  
  
Everybody's business ain't nobody's business  
In other words  
They don't know half of what I go through  
(To give) give you what you need  
(To be there) to be there for you and still do my thing

I'm staring at the clock  
It's a quarter to three  
I'm tossing in my bed  
Cause I just can't sleep  
Cause you're not here with me  
I'm reaching out for you  
I wish I could talk to you  
Trying to figure out  
What's going on with me  
I'm used to having  
All the answers for everything  
Oh girl, I think she is the one  
Who where that's coming from  
  
It's so crazy  
Babe you simply amaze me  
Somewhere it's wrong  
When lately I owe it all to you  
All those lately used to be now  
Seem so lately  
I'm coming down with this new me  
All I know is that you are the cure  
Cause I've been diagnosed for love  
  
Does anybody know the answer to this question  
Cause I'm confused so now  
I'm hoping for suggestions  
My heart is taking loud (So loud)  
What is this about (About)  
I'm really changing now, Oh  
Cleared all the numbers out my phone  
Then left that whole life go on  
So are two of the symptoms I see  
And I believe, oh girl, I am sure  
That you are my miracle  
  
It's so crazy  
Babe you simply amaze me  
Somewhere it's wrong  
When lately I owe it all to you  
All those lately used to be now  
Seem so lately

All I know is that you are the cure  
Cause I've been diagnosed for love

Nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah  
If anybody feels me

And let me hear you say  
Nah nah nah nah nah, nah nah  
Girl cause all I know

Before my system shut us down.  
Matter of fact I think

Perfect model before my time.  
Download to my instant data,

Told that I was supposed to fail  
I would'nt amount to much of nothin'  
Yes I pray  
There was days I wondered if you really loved me  
But baby you feel pain.  
Mama was sane when I felt like runnin' away.  
I couldn't take it.  
I'm so hinted, angry with all of the world.  
I couldn't keep friends just wishin' you'd come back and see  
My difficult times being an adolescent.  
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean.  
  
I needed you  
When I needed a father figure.  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin'the wrong decisions.  
At seventeen, when the cold of the world got my back up against the wall.  
I need, I needed you.  
(With the hope of being sometihng special in life)  
(And what happens when the one that they depend on the most)  
I need, I needed you.  
(Is never there)  
  
Told that I was supposed to fail  
I wouldn't amount to much of nothin'.  
Yes I pray  
There was days I wondered if you really loved me.  
But baby you feel pain.  
Mama was sane when I felt like runnin' away.  
I couldn't take it.  
I'm so hinted, angry with all of the world.

I needed you  
When I needed a father figure.  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions.  
At seventeen, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall.  
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go.  
I needed you.  
I need, I needed you.  
I needed you.  
I need, I need you.  
Seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall.  
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go.  
  
Mama had no financial help  
And thoughts of breakin' the law came.  
Seein' her tryna hold down two jobs was tearin' up on me had a way (had a
way).  
All my friends was gettin' in it  
It came time for me to get that dough.  
Wrong or right I had to go for what I know.  
  
I needed you  
When I needed a father figure.  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions.  
At seventeen, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall.  
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go.

I need, I needed you.  
I needed you.  
I need, I need you.  
Seventeen when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall.  
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go.  
  
An Lord I pray.  
Give me strength to forgive them and not hold all the I've hate I got.  
Even though the pains from this was too heavy.  
Lord I pray.  
Show my younger brothers growin' up without a father how to turn what they
have less into a legacy.  
Lord I pray.  
  
From the knowledge I ain't get  
God, you gave me.  
And temptations was callin' me, didn't know which way to go.  
  
I needed you  
When I needed a father figure.  
I needed you  
To stop me from makin' the wrong decisions.  
At seventeen, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall.  
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go.

Look, I know we been friends for a while now  
But, I just feel I can confess to you  
It's gon' be hard but, alright here it goes  
  
Imagine that the pillow that you cried on was my chest  
And the tissue that you wiped your face with was my hand  
Girl, imagine if you needed advice about some other guy,  
I'm the one that comes to mind  
Not try'na hear you tell nobody that I'm just a friend  
Just try'na make sure I'm that body that you call your man  
And anytime you need a shoulder, it's yours night or day  
Well, what I'm try'na say is  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna be, the last number you call late at night  
Said I wanna be, the first one that you dial when you open your eyes  
Wanna be the one you run to, wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you  
I wanna be, yeah  
Wanna be, yeah  
  
Be the man makin' your girls jealous (Girl, I wanna be)  
Be the guy shuttin' down all the fellas (ooh)  
Whatever you need, girl it's all on me  
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (ooh)  
Girl, I wanna be yours  
  
Would it be cool, would you mind if I called you my boo, (my boo)  
What if the next whip you was pushin' was the one I bought for you  
Can I be the one that meets your Pops and take your mama shoppin'  
Be the only one that I (wait!), have you thought about it (wait), Really
thought about it  
Maybe you should take some time, call your girls and talk about it (yeah)  
Cause I done already made up my mind (my mind)  
Don't need no more time to know if I wanna be with you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Be the man makin' your girls jealous (I wanna)  
Be the guy shuttin' down all the fellas (fellas, yeah)  
Whatever you need, girl it's all on me  
Your soldier, your friend or your lover (ooh)  
Girl, I wanna be yours  
  
Put me on your screen saver, all over your Myspace and  
Make me one of your five favorites, that's where I wanna be  
The one you cryin' for, stayin' up all night fightin' for  
Wanna be your good, bad, love, hate, Girl!  
  
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good  
I'ma do you right, show you right, Get this understood  
Cross my heart, hope to die, on everything that's good  
I'ma do you right, show you right, Get this understood  
  
I wanna be, the last number that you call late at night (oh)

Wanna be the one you run to  
Wanna be the one that ain't gon' hurt you (oh)  
I wanna be, yeah (I wanna yours)  
Wanna be, yeah  
  
Be the man makin' your girls jealous (jealous, yeah)

You say you wanna wait a while  
  
Girl, I ain't mad at you, In fact I like your style  
'Cause it's more than just a physical attraction that I'm feeling  
It's real, ooooh and maybe here's the deal

And the sun and the moon and the stars  
They all refuse to shine  
I'll be right here  
I wanna be the thought that you think whatever is on your mind  
I'll be right here  
Girl I wanna be a part of you just like the air you breathe  
And you can count on me

There's a star in the palm of my hands  
And I think it's yours  
You don't want me  
Then I'll understand  
You deserve much more  
When I brought it  
Down from the sky, you almost forgot it  
It was new back when you gave a dam  
What ya need I'll go and get it.  
  
But if I don't come back  
Girl your love was worth it  
That's the one thing I'll know  
And if I don't make it back  
Girl remember that  
That I said I'd go baby  
Girl your love is so hard  
But it takes me so far  
But I don't care, I'll go  
If I don't make it home  
But at least now you know  
Girl for you, I'll go.  
  
Got my heart in the palm of your hands  
Now you sure that's yours  
If you don't want it  
I wont understand  
Cause I came so far  
When you tossed it  
It took forever to find the place where you lost it  
Now your gone with my heart out the door  
Well its here girl  
Don't forget it.  
  
But if you don't come back  
Girl your love was worth it  
That's the one thing I know  
If you don't make it back  
Girl remember that  
That I said I'll go for you  
Girl remember that  
That I said I'd go baby  
Girl your love is so hard  
And it takes me so far  
But I don't care, I'll go  
If I don't make it home  
But at least now you know, I'll go.

[Intro: Kid Ink]  
Said I ain't even gotta say shit  
You know who I'm talking to  
Said I ain't even gotta say shit  
  
[Verse 1: Chris Brown]  
Baby you know, that I cry all these tears for you  
No one compares to the smile you make when  
When I hit it, taste that kitty  
I ain't even gotta say shit  
Ten girls in the back seat nigga I'm with it  
She broke my heart, I guess she's a superstar now  
When all I really needed was your love  
  
[Chorus]  
She don't wanna love me no more  
She said I was doing too much  
And now I'm all alone with nobody  
I might as well roll up  
I'm tired of fighting, already been down that road  
And she don't wanna love me no more  
She don't wanna love me no more  
  
[Verse 2: Kid Ink]  
She don't wanna love me no more  
All her shit parked front at the front door  
How the hell did we get here so damn fast?  
Foot to the gas tryin' to cover your nose  
Stop sniffing around still ain't gonna find nothing  
Acting like Sherlock Holmes or something  
They say love don't cost a thing  
But I can see change girl keep it one hunned  
If you really wanna leave  
If you really wanna go, you gotta make it through me  
I ain't doing this alone  
Think I'm going insane and it usually turns you on but right now  
  
[Chorus]  
She don't wanna love me no more  
She said I was doing too much  
And now I'm all alone with nobody  
I might as well roll up  
I'm tired of fighting, already been down that road  
And she don't wanna love me no more  
She don't wanna love me no more

I know why you want love in the middle of the night  
Don't be looking out scary  
When you've been looking for this for long long time  
Come on over here baby you can love me in the dark,  
You can love me in the light  
... Looking out crazy, 'cause you're going on me and we left behind  
They can come to baby  
What's... As long as they're fine,... Can't help it  
Tell them one night the time and they all like...  
  
Chorus:  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
... Once, love me, love me, love me love me love me  
You're looking for the...  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
She... Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
  
You can come to daddy, I'll be your lover whatever you lie  
Let me live... Don't you mack me after the next try  
'Cause... And the... In town for one more night  
You ain't the only hear it, so many girls ain't lie going crazy outside.  
  
Chorus:  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
... Once, love me, love me, love me love me love me  
You're looking for the...  
Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
She... Love me, love me, love me, love me love me love me...  
  
To the... After... And we can do whatever you tell me  
You smell me,... Come long...  
But when I'm home I'm rambo silvester stalone  
And she know that, pincher... Like...  
Listen the body... Tell em the whole that  
And if you see a...  
  
[Chorus:]

Lights on, stage set  
I guess I gotta put on a show again  
Cause everyone's waiting  
Females, fly jets  
When I turn the radio on  
I hear all my songs playing, yeah  
Whatever money can buy  
I probably got it  
That's real talk, yeah  
I see my name in the sky all over the world  
And I just sit hear saying, lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down  
I still wear a smile  
Lucky me  
Even though I'm so damaged  
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd  
Lucky me  
  
Plenty of my loved ones wanna be stars  
Cause nobody said it would be so hard  
Wouldn't put this on no one else  
Yeah, lucky me  
  
So exclusive  
I don't have to wait in the line  
It's like the club is mine now  
If it was only that simple  
Then what I'm saying is easy to do  
And we know that's not true  
Whatever money can buy  
I probably got it  
That's real talk, yeah  
I see my name in the sky all over the world  
And I just sit hear saying, lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down  
I still wear a smile  
Lucky me  
Even though I'm so damaged  
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd  
Lucky me  
Complaining to my loved ones I wanna be a star  
But no one ever told me it would be so hard  
I wouldn't put this on no one else  
Yeah, lucky me  
  
My dream and it's my heart  
The life of being a star  
You don't even know how hard it is, do you, yeah  
Now I'm thankfully for everything  
And I'm finally becoming a man  
Now I gotta bigger a show to do  
Lucky me  
  
I gotta pose for the cameras  
Even when my world's falling down  
I still wear a smile  
Lucky me  
Even though I'm so damaged  
I gotta pick myself up and perform for the crowd  
Lucky me  
Complaining to my loved ones I wanna be a star  
But no one ever told me it would be so hard  
I wouldn't put this on no one else  
Yeah, lucky me

(This Goes out to mama)  
Your momma,  
And everybody momma (haha)  
Here we go... listen listen  
  
[Verse 1]  
I remember Saturday mornin's  
Me wakin' up to momma in the kitchen cookin' to Sam Cook and  
I was just a young dude, watchin' mornin' cartoons, waitin' for momma to braid
my hair  
I used to hate to get it done, cause she'd braid it too tight  
My momma always gave a style she knew I would like, and then  
I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch  
While me and Rob played ball  
  
[Bridge]  
Momma always did little things like that  
Momma always will know I love her for that  
For all the things that you used to do...  
Momma I dedicate this one to you  
  
[Chorus]  
It's straight from the heart  
This is your song  
You're my lucky charm so you already know,

From every tour, every show  
You're my lucky charm, go wherever I go  
Momma Ima sing this one to you, momma let me sing this one to you  
  
[Verse 2]  
She's like the mother of Tappahannock, VA  
Everybody knew miss Joyce, where we stayed  
All heads said she was cool, nothing' that she wouldn't do  
But about CB, she was know to act a fool (whoawhoa)  
With the little money that she made  
She took the bed and made it all okay  
Night at the daycare, when we had to stay there  
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now  
  
[Bridge]  
Momma always did little things like that (oh)  
Momma always will know (aye) I love her for that  
For all the things that you used to do...  
Momma I dedicate this one to you  
  
Sing with the song of Chris Brown, Mama lyrics!  
  
[Chorus]  
It's straight from the heart  
This is your song  
You're my lucky charm so (so you already know) you already know,  
That Ima sing this one for you, so let me sing this one for you  
From every tour (from every tour o yea yea), every show  
You're my lucky charm (you're my lucky charm),go wherever I go  
Momma Ima sing this (Ima sing it) one to you, (Just let me sing it)  
Momma let me sing (whoa yea) this one to you  
  
[Verse 3]  
(oo'oo)  
Momma I thank you for all you've done (oo'oo)  
I thank God everyday I'm your son (oh)  
(You gave) You gave me everything that I need  
But lovin' me unconditionally...  
Everybody say... "M-O-M-M-A"  
Everybody say... momma  
"M-O-M-M-A"  
You know that this is your song  
  
[Chorus]  
It's straight from the heart (oh momma)

Bad on the phone but in person you are panicking  
I ain't even stressed, got a bag full of cannabis

She needs a principle, not a substitute

What are you thinking?  
I know you see  
Your cell phone blinking  
Backwards  
And forward I'm pacing  
Trying to figure out  
Why you aint calling me back  
What does it all mean?  
Maybe you're trying  
To show me something  
But you aint  
Gotta do it this way, no  
Put yourself in my shoes  
Tell me what would you do  
  
[Chorus]  
She knows  
I've been hitting her  
On the phone  
And I know  
She's been gettin it  
Something's wrong  
Could it be  
That she's with the other dude  
From her past  
I know damn well that she aint  
Sittin there laughin  
With her girlfriends  
Lookin at the number  
Talking bout it's him again  
I know  
She better call pretty soon  
I'm gonna send the boys  
To find out  
Just why she's been M.I.A  
  
Is it a problem?  
And if it's really one  
I'ma solve it  
don't know how  
You handled other dudes  
But I'm not them  
Girl you runnin around  
Got 'em thinkin  
That I can't handle my thang  
Ooh, are you crazy?  
Did you really think you could play me?  
I'm bout to show up on your doorstep  
And you better answer when I knock  
Knock, you better be by yourself  
  
[Chorus]  
She knows  
I've been hitting  
Her on the phone  
And I know  
She's been gettin it  
Something's wrong  
Could it be  
That she's with the other dude  
From her past  
I know damn well that she aint  
Sittin there laughin  
With her girlfriends  
Lookin at the number  
Talking bout it's him again  
I know she better call pretty soon  
I'm gonna send the boys to find out  
Just why she's been M.I.A  
  
You can't run  
(Cause the boys are gonna find ya, girl)  
You can't hide  
(Cause you know I'm right behind ya, girl)  
If you tellin the truth  
Then why you actin like you scared?  
Over there  
You can't run  
(Cause them boys are gonna find ya, ooh)  
You can't hide  
(Cause you know I'm right behind ya, ooh)  
If what you say is true  
Then why you can't comin back baby  
Baby  
  
[Chorus]  
She knows  
I've been hitting  
Her on the phone  
And I know  
She's been gettin it  
Something's wrong  
Could it be that she's  
With the other dude  
From her past  
I know damn well that she aint  
Sittin there laughin

Lookin at the number  
Talking bout it's him again  
I know she better call pretty soon

Layin' here  
All out of ideas  
Ain't picked up the phone  
In so damn long  
I got the lights off  
And I aint sleep bout a week  
You got a man in defeat  
And that's the picture of me  
The last time we spoke  
I said goodbye  
You had this look on your face  
So many tears in your eyes  
And I tried  
To say it was for the best  
But now I regret my choice  
  
And if I had it to do all over  
I would find me another way  
To express what's on my mind  
And try to find me the words I wanna say  
And now I'm to hurt to love another  
But I'm too proud to ask you back  
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song  
But I needed to tell you that  
When I  
  
When I first let you go I aint know that it would hurt  
But I miss you  
I aint never had it bad  
But each day is gettin worse cuz I miss you  
Baby  
Sorry  
The things I said and the things I did  
If you want to hurry home cuz I'm sittin here alone  
Cuz I miss you  
  
You had heart enough to handle me  
But I kept my heart out of reach  
Feeling strong enough to carry us  
Still I violated every trust  
Is it too late  
I wonder to say I'm sorry  
Too late  
I wonder to bed your pardon  
All I think about is how I messed it up  
And all I think about is how I need ya love  
  
And if I had it to do all over  
I would find me another way  
To express what's on my mind  
And try to find me the words I wanna say  
And now I'm to hurt to love another  
But I'm too proud to ask you back  
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song  
But I needed to tell you that  
When I  
  
When I first let you go I aint know that it would hurt  
But I miss you  
I aint never had it bad  
But each day is gettin worse cuz I miss you  
Baby  
Sorry  
The things I said and the things I did  
If you want to hurry home cuz I'm sittin here alone  
Cuz I miss you  
  
And If I can see you  
I'll tell you that I'm sorry  
I'll tell you that it's my fault  
And I don't wanna be alone  
And if I can hold you  
I'll love you like I never did before  
And then I would love you more  
Never ever let you go  
  
I swear that if I had it to do all over (had it to do)  
I would find me another way (find another way)  
To express what's on my mind  
And try to find me the words I wanna say  
And now I'm to hurt to love another (too hurt to love)  
But too damn proud to ask you back (too proud to ask you back)  
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song  
But I needed, I needed to tell you that  
  
When I first let you go I aint know that it would hurt  
But I miss you  
I aint never had it bad  
But each day is gettin worse cuz I miss you  
Baby  
Sorry  
The things I said and the things I did  
If you want to hurry home cuz I'm sittin here alone  
Cuz I miss you ...

Slow it up slow it up slow it down
