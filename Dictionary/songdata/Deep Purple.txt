Nothing here for me today  
Garbaggio from the men in grey  
Don't do this  
You can't do that  
What's the point  
What's the matter, anyway  
Fat cat's licking cream  
Dirty business  
Hard and mean  
Narrow eyes and hungry days  
There's got to be  
A better way  
  
Something here about my face  
Something make you think  
I got time to waste  
What you doing  
Standing here  
Why don't you call  
Someone who cares  
Fat cats all the same  
Easy answers just a game  
Another day nothing changes  
There's got to be a better way  
  
A glistening of questioners  
Prepared the inquisition  
While jackals in the shadows  
Manoeuvre for position  
  
A fundament of righteous men  
A barrow ideals  
The carriage of misjustice  
Crushes all beneath it's wheels  
Conspiracies of silence  
Within the temple walls  
Graveyards full of promises  
Tha no one can recall  
  
A castle full of rascals  
A fortress full of thieves  
A parliament of silver tongues  
That latter to deceive  
  
Oh my darling Carolina  
If you get the chance  
To walk behind here  
She's so clean  
You see no splash  
Just the Texas chainsaw massacre  
Fat cat's got to go  
I'm Rockin' and rollin'  
From my headache to my toes  
She's trying to set the world on fire  
Up there in her Ivory tower

John San what you can  
La la Janette dance in sand  
What's the mystery, my son?  
Gypsy Dan Caravan  
Won Tun Wan with your Chinese fan  
It's part of history my son  
  
Murder and rape with your power  
The 10th revolution in far away days  
It's come to this  
A gypsy's kiss  
All your power's gonna fade in the haze  
  
Ya who' Jumme gae bile ya heed  
The Senorita said  
I'll drag your lungs out through your nose  
Space truckers free and high  
Teamsters get you by and by  
That should keep you on your toes  
  
They got a gun at your head  
But you ain't necessarily playing their game  
They can't resist  
A Gypsy's Kiss  
All that's needed to drive them insane  
  
John Wayne, the Alamo  
Crazy Horse, Geronimo  
I'll smoke a piece with you  
Mind, body heart and soul  
We got rock and roll  
And there's nothing they can do  
  
Hear the small voice of truth  
Above the shouting despair of the crowd  
What do you wish  
A Gypsy's Kiss?  
Gets you strong for crying out loud.

Mother nature's been good to me  
That's why I'm sittin' in this cherry tree  
But it's alright, it's alright  
It's not so bad  
I'm just a touch away  
  
The shady lady  
From shady lane  
Is lying in my bed again  
And it's alright  
It feels good  
It's not so bad  
When she's just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I ask  
And it's alright, OK yes  
Light as a feather, oh yes  
  
Like a rosebud  
When the sun is high  
She opens up  
Before my eyes  
And the light falls  
On her wet skin  
It's alright  
I'm just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I know  
And it's alright, oh yes  
Light as a feather,  
And just a touch away  
  
Put a finger to her lips again  
She cries with pleasure  
Cries with pain  
And it's alright  
It feels good  
It's not so bad  
We're just a touch away  
  
Nothing much  
Is all I know  
Not too fast  
Not too slow  
And it's alright  
Soft as a feather  
And just a touch away

There's still a long way to go  
And the nights are closing in  
But if I'd travelled any faster babe  
Lord knows where I might have been  
  
Right from those early days  
I put my faith in the axle not the wheels  
Like old Zeno's toytus  
with Achilles snapping at my heels  
  
Don't worry  
There's no hurry  
Here we are  
With all the time in the world  
  
I could have been a high-flying dealer  
But I have no desire for speed  
I could have been a wild receiver  
But I've got everything I need  
  
And so I watch the world  
Go racing by tearing up the street  
I lay back in the long grass  
Take it easy and rest my feet  
  
Don't worry  
You know, there's no hurry  
Here we are  
With all the time in the world  
  
No-one ever held me back  
You know that no-one ever put me in chains  
No-one ever saw me racing ahead  
No-one had to tug on my reins  
  
As everybody knows  
I may be slow but I never quit  
Sometimes on a good day I sit and think  
Sometimes I just sit  
  
Don't worry  
Relax, there's no hurry  
Here we are  
With all the time in the world

I know you're the only one who understands  
Afore ye go, before you leave  
You always shake my hand  
Even when I'm crazy, on fire and naked  
Just as Nature intended  
No style but easily blended  
  
You always know where I'll be found  
Hanging somewhere near the ground  
Help me up or help me down  
  
Don't want to lose those days  
When everything is just a haze  
I'm dreaming  
  
I believe I could walk before I learned to crawl  
When I look up, the Devil's looking back  
From the mirror on the wall  
You can open the door  
Got my feet stuck to the floor  
I may have lost my way  
But I didn't get where I am today  
  
Don't want to lose those days  
When everything is just a haze  
I'm dreaming  
  
You spin into my empty room  
And once again I'm almost human  
Almost human

When the night wind softly blows through my open window  
Then I start to remember the girl that brought me joy  
Now the night wind softly blows sadness to tomorrow  
Bringing tears to eyes so tired  
Eyes I thought could cry no more  
  
If the day would only come  
Then you might just appear  
Even though you'd soon be gone  
When I reached out my hand  
  
If I could see you  
If only I could see you  
To see if you are laughing or crying  
When the night winds softly blow  
  
In my dark and whispering room  
Memories still bring me a numbness to my feelings  
Take my hand and brush my brow  
In the warm and fevered dark  
Heart is madly beating  
My crazy thoughts are burning  
When the night winds softly blow  
  
If the day would only come  
Then you might just appear  
Even though you'd soon be gone  
When I reached out my hand  
  
If I could see you  
If only I could see you  
To see if you are laughing or crying  
When the night winds softly blow  
  
If the day would only come  
Then you might just appear  
Even though you'd soon be gone  
When I reached out my hand  
  
If I could see you  
If only I could see you  
To see if you are laughing or crying  
When the night winds softly blow

If you're in the right city at the right time  
What's the last thing going through your mind  
Not talking 'bout your, ask no questions, you know it's a lie  
You're just a victim of a corporate crime  
All the signs of a shark attack  
You've got rivers of blood on the streets, don't look back  
Nothing personal, just another snack  
'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns  
Any fule kno that  
  
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz  
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is  
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit  
Just trying to keep her happy  
There's no laughing in heaven, not the one, not the seven  
And you'll never get to heaven in her row boat  
Pea brain pisser, dog breath kisser  
'N Harley said you're better off sticking to your guns  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
  
Ooh  
Won't it be nice  
When everything falls into place  
  
Salad days go a-tickling by  
Have a high time, burn money in the meantime  
They bleed you dry  
Those suckers are smaller than life  
Oh Moronica Queen of the Biz  
And her friend Flash Harry thinks he knows what it is  
Tin Pan Alley Fat Head Larry don't know shit  
I'm better off sticking to my guns  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
  
Ooh  
Won't it be nice  
When everything falls into place  
  
Danny went down to the river one day  
Didn't come back, that's the last, they say  
We ever saw of him, that's no lie  
Spitting in your eye, have no fear  
You don't want the truth  
Stick your finger in your ear  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that  
Any fule kno that

I stood under your bedroom window  
Throwing up a brick  
No one came I threw one more  
That really did the trick  
Your daddy came and banged my head  
He said what kind of man  
Is this that's hanging 'round my girl  
And threw me in the can  
You're a farmer's daughter  
You're a farmer's daughter  
Why do I always get  
The kinda girl I didn't oughta get  
I won't get no more eggs and water  
Now I've laid the farmer's daughter  
  
Imagine I was a full-grown man  
And I could talk just right  
Could I come and see you here  
And do this every night  
Wham! The door comes crashing down  
Your daddy's face all pale  
Says come with me you hairy bum  
I'll put you in my jail  
You're a judge's daughter  
You're a judge's daughter  
Why do I always get  
The kinda girl I didn't oughta get  
Now I'm getting jail and torture  
'Cause I made the judge's daughter  
  
It seems they're screaming law and order  
When I go with anyone's daughter  
  
Woman I should like some peace  
And daddy hold your tongue  
I think you're gonna die of fright  
When I tell you what I've done  
I can hear your tales and lies  
You say I'm dumb and scraggy  
But man this dumb and scraggy is  
Your daughter's baby's daddy  
She's a lucky daughter  
Such a lucky daughter  
Why did I always get  
The kinda girl I didn't want to get  
Now I've got what I always fought for  
'Cause I've married a rich man's daughter

April is a cruel time  
Even though the sun may shine  
And world looks in the shade as it slowly comes away  
Still falls the April rain  
And the valley's filled with pain  
And you can't tell me quite why  
As I look up to the gray sky  
Where it should be blue  
Grey sky where I should see you  
Ask why, why it should be so  
I'll cry, say that I don't know  
  
Baby once in a while I'll forget and I'll smile  
But then the feeling comes again of an April without end  
Of an April lonely as a girl  
In the dark of my mind I can see all too fine  
But there is nothing to be done when I just can't feel the sun  
And the springtime's the season of the night  
  
Grey sky where it should be blue  
Grey sky where I should see you  
Ask why, why it should be so  
I'll cry, say that I don't know  
I don't know

I've got nothing to say today  
I used my words up yesterday  
  
I'm just lying here in the sun  
Watching you guys having fun  
  
Seven days and seven nights  
Working till you got it right  
  
Don't help me I'll help myself  
I'll pull some crackers off the shelf  
  
She had her hair done yesterday  
Now she's coming out to play  
  
First you pull and then you push  
Two in the hand and one in the bush  
  
Oh, my love is  
So excited  
When I say we've  
Been invited  
Now we're going  
To the palace  
Dressing up for  
Tea with Alice  
  
Some will rise and some will fall  
Some will come to nothing at all  
  
The strangest people have the power  
To lead me to my darkest hour  
  
How can you be sure it's me  
When it's payment on delivery  
  
Oh, my love is  
So excited  
When I say we've  
Been invited  
  
Now we're going  
To the palace  
Dressing up for  
Tea with Alice  
  
Now my love is  
Richer than rich  
'Cause I studied  
Mathematics  
  
Graduated  
Without honors  
Everyone has  
Gone Bananas

The daylight fades and the stars comes out  
But there's never much to talk about  
Another day goes rushing by and here we are just wondering why  
We have to belong with a sense of purpose  
That's all we need, without them we're worthless  
Ah, we've come so far, hm, but then again  
All we see is more of the same  
It's getting crowded here we agree no doubt  
Oh dear brother what's it all about?  
  
Hey you over there why don't you throw down your spear?  
We all need some help right now  
Where are we going from here?  
The way things are working out  
It won't be too long before we have to move  
Better start thinking about it  
While there's still time to choose  
  
Every day of my life I discover  
Someone murdering my sisters and brothers  
In the name of some god or another  
What do you know  
  
For the first precious few it's time to go  
What might have been we'll never know  
All those bad ideas became the law  
Oh yes, we've forgotten what we're looking for  
All of you angels it's time to gather your wings  
Leave it all behind you won't need any of those things  
We're going on through the darkness hand in hand  
To step into the future  
Before time began  
  
And for those who remain with your chosen gods  
May your prayers be answered.

Gotta black breast Chinese eyes  
Got an English brain that's gonna make me wise  
Got a long story that I wanna tell  
To a rhythm that I know so well  
Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give  
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live  
I tried another but she didn't want to know  
  
Take a hold now if you can  
Take a lesson from a hard lovin' man  
I'm a long way from where I wanna go  
Guess I'll stay awhile I really love you so  
How's about another sip of all the wine you got  
Take a tip from me and give it here I'll drink the lot  
I'm not a winey, I'm a puttin' on a show  
  
You really really grab me but I've gotta move  
Before they know I'm here and spread the news  
Maybe in while when I've moved around  
I can find a way to pay you back your twenty pounds  
Really got a lot of lovin' that I wanna give  
Baby I'm a mystery but you know I gotta live  
I tried another but she didn't want to know

My mama showed me how to rock in the cradle  
But I learned how to roll along  
My papa said "son, gotta git some fun  
Cos when you're old it ain't too good on your own"  
Been so long, since you heard my song  
Gonna pick up my guitar 'n' play  
Felt so bad when I had to leave you  
But, I knew that I'd be back some day  
  
So I'm comin' home  
To give you more than you bargained for  
Comin' home  
No mistake, I'm gonna shiver 'n' shake  
Comin' home  
Gonna rock 'n' roll an' give you my soul  
Comin' home  
I got over the pain, I'm comin' home again  
  
Groovin' to American Bandstand  
B.B. onstage with 'Lucille'  
The thrill is gone, but it won't be for long  
Cos you know I like to play how I feel  
Now that we're all back together  
Gonna shiver 'n' shake all night  
I just gotta say, the music I play  
Will sure 'nough make you feel alright  
  
Tho' I learned how to rock in the cradle  
An' rollin' came so easy to me  
All the years I travelled the world  
Made it so clear to see  
It's been so long since you heard my song  
Gonna pick up my guitar 'n' play  
Felt so bad when I had to leave you  
But I knew that I'd be back some day  
  
Comin' home  
To give you more than you bargained for  
Comin' home  
No mistake, I'm gonna shiver and shake  
Comin' home  
Gonna rock 'n' roll and give you my soul  
Comin' home  
I got over the pain, I'm comin' home again  
Comin' home  
Shiver 'n' shakin', anticpatin'  
Comin' home  
The thrill is gone but it won't be for long

Don't turn off the light  
You might draw the Queen of Spades  
Don't shut the door  
You don't need to be alone  
I won't bring you no food  
There might be some poison in your meat  
I've got to know  
  
Are you dead or alive  
Don't shut the door  
Are you dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Pick your window you're leaving  
  
Don't look in the mirror  
With a dollar up your face  
You've got money to burn  
You're cheap at half the price  
Oh don't powder your nose  
Don't blow your brains just for the the crack  
I've got to know  
  
Are you dead or alive  
Just for the crack  
Are you dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Pick your window you're leaving  
  
You're running so fast  
But you know you're standing still  
I'm afraid of your shadow  
And the knife in it's hand  
You're dancing with death  
To the tune of the dealer  
And he don't care  
Don't give a toss  
Don't want to know  
  
If you're dead or alive  
Don't want to know  
If you're dead or alive  
Dead or alive  
Pick your window you're leaving

If you fool around  
With the dealer  
Remember soon  
You'll have to pay  
He'll creep behind you  
Like a hunter  
Just to steal your soul away  
I don't want no one  
Messing with my woman  
But just the same  
I don't see nobody  
Fooling with you  
If you're snowblind  
Madonna can hold you  
But if you don't understand  
There is nothing she can do for you  
  
Running from the dealer  
Trying to save your soul  
  
I can feel the fire  
Coming from inside you  
I know what it's like  
'cause I've been burned before  
Ain't no mercy  
In the hunger but  
You're a fool to yourself  
'cause your dealer keeps you begging for more  
  
Running from the dealer  
Trying to save your soul  
  
In the beginning all you wanted  
Was the calm before the storm  
If the bluebird plays the eagle  
He finds his song will turn to stone  
Dealer

I don't have a problem  
I'm not seeking her advice  
I'm saving that for later  
Yeh, it's something awful nice  
I had a shaky feeling  
When she floated into sight  
I imagine we'll be doing it tonight  
  
I'm ragged round the edges  
All these people in the room  
There's magic in the air  
I'm guessing she can feel it too  
Prospective recreation  
Helps me keep her in my sight  
I imagine we'll be doing it tonight  
  
That's why everybody's sitting around  
We can't think of nothing better to do  
There's no empty bottle  
They're all half full  
So we end up spinning a shoe  
  
We keep on going 'til poor old Lenny's  
Got drool hanging off of his chin  
He can't stop winning  
When the shoe stops spinning  
But he doesn't know where to begin  
  
She wasn't in the running  
She was never in the game  
I could see her in the distance  
But I could not lay my claim  
Let me tell you 'bout this cherry  
I never got a single bite  
Therefore I imagine we'll be doing it  
Tonight

One day I'll get home before the sun hits the blinds  
And give you - I'll give you something to remember me by  
That's the way I am  
It's what I got in mind but I don't know if I can  
You gotta shoot your gun - don't expect me to dance  
Hold me up to the spotlight but  
Don't, don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
These empty pockets are my deepest friends  
Full of nothing but good intentions  
That's the way it is  
It may not be much but I can blow you a kiss  
I've been wrong - I've been wrong once before  
I'll be all right tomorrow but  
Don't, don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
  
I may be lazy or a living wreck  
I won't be swayed by your expectations  
That's the way it is  
It may not be much but you know what to kiss  
I've been wrong - I've been wrong once before  
I'll be all right tomorrow but  
Don't, don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  
Don't hold your breath  

I get lost on a regular basis  
I'm not alone I see the same old faces  
Back on the road it's a worthy opponent  
I get home in the heat of the moment  
  
What's that stuff always rise to the surface  
College cream, it always emerges  
Be what you are I tell myself  
And myself tells me we can't be anybody else  
  
You always sleep with a smile on your face  
Much as I want to put myself in your place  
Not my business I've got dreams of my own  
I try to recall but when I wake up it's gone  
  
Don't let go of that image  
You'll never see it again  
  
I can hear voices they're buzzing in my head  
Eyebrows raised was it something I said  
A long hot night, it crept in like a thief  
The engine stopped, the seat belt popped  
And her jaw dropped in disbelief  
  
Don't let go of that beast  
You'll never see it again  
  
Don't let go of that whiskey bottle  
You'll never see it again

You stare into the room, nothing there but space  
No sign of any message gone without a trace  
But I don't want your pity, if that's what you think  
I'll take my comfort from this hole I'm sinking in  
Waste my time, drink my wine, take my money  
That's alright, I don't mind but don't try to be funny  
  
Don't make me good  
Don't make me mad  
Don't make me fly  
Don't make me happy  
  
It's nice here in this room, you would like it, yes you would  
It's got a bed, two chairs and a table, I'd leave here if I could  
There's a man standing up who's down on his knees  
Outside the cold wind sends a shiver through the trees  
On the line, left behind, under pressure  
It's so bad, leave me be, I don't want to get better  
  
Don't make me good  
Don't make me mad  
Don't make me fly  
Don't make me happy  
  
I don't care what you think but think about this  
It could have been somebody else, beware of what you wish  
Now the door is closed, locked and sealed  
And now you think you know how rejection feels  
Waste my time, drink my wine, take my money  
That's alright, I don't mind but don't try to be funny  
  
Don't make me good  
Don't make me mad  
Don't make me fly  
Don't make me happy

I was born a rambling man  
An' I never got the chance  
To settle down an' get a hold on love  
Takin' air an' movin' around  
Is all I can see that I'm doin'  
An' it is bringin' me down  
Drivin' on a highway going nowhere  
Desolation destination  
Guess I'll find it somewhere  
I know if there's trouble  
I ain't takin' the blame  
That's why I keep movin'  
So nobody knows my name  
  
Born a loser  
I'm beyond the law  
Women behind me  
Never can find me  
They can never get together  
What I've been here for  
'cause I'm a drifter  
  
Rollin' on  
Ain't wastin' my time no more

Emmaretta, did you get my letter?  
I sent it to you, oh Emmaretta  
Do you still feel when night is falling  
Something calling, oh Emmaretta  
Behind my thoughts, oh Emmaretta  
I can get to you to feel better  
I must go now, oh Emmaretta  
Full moon's rising, oh Emmaretta  
Oh, it's a thousand miles  
Oh, and I need you child  
Oh, they can drive me wild  
What I feel can make it real  
Help  
Oh, it's a thousand miles  
Oh, and I need you child  
Oh, they can drive me wild  
If what I feel can make it real  
Emmaretta, did you get my letter  
I sent it to you, oh Emmaretta  
Do you still feel when night is falling  
Something calling, oh Emmaretta

Some say the state of Texas  
Could accommodate the entire  
Human population  
Five point six billion versions of  
The truth under one roof  
Some revelation  
Take a bit of this give a  
Bit of that  
Put it in a blender pull it  
Out a hat  
There's no going back it's a lie  
It's a fact  
Has the cat got your tongue  
Been too long in the sun  
There's dust on your tracks  
There's no going back  
  
Come to think of it's a  
Load of monkeys  
Every time you listen to your  
Sun kissed lover's words  
Evil Louie is tomorrow's sadness  
It's a game of madness in a  
Perfect world  
  
Some would say French cuisine's  
More appealing  
Than a cold drink  
Burgers and fries  
Some have said that a  
Pillar of society  
An upright citizen's incapable of  
Lust and crime  
Tale a bit of this  
Give a bit of that  
Put it in a blender pull  
It out a hat  
But he don't stand a change  
With his pants around his ankles  
Has the cat got your tongue  
Been too long in the sun  
There's dust on your tracks  
There's no going back

Everything went wrong  
I'm sorry boys I've got to  
Let you go  
We've had some hard times and  
The long rain, it didn't show  
Hired hands I've seen them  
Come and go  
But you don't come much better  
Today's blue Monday I just got  
A bad news letter  
  
This day has come  
The darkest cloud on our horizon  
My hands are tied down to that  
Promise note I signed upon  
Always been this way  
It's the poor man who gets hurt  
All you ever work for is to leave  
Your footprints in the dirt  
  
You work your fingers  
To the bone  
  
The deed is done  
The fruit will fall  
To someone else's hand  
That's how the land lies  
Now we all know where  
We stand  
You'll have to walk away  
Don't let them see you running  
Today's Blue Monday, I should  
Have seen it coming  
  
You work your fingers  
To the bone  
  
If sweat and tears were  
All it took  
To make this valley green  
We'd be alright but now it's  
Gone they've taken everything  
They say it's just an act of God  
And that's the way  
I'll wind blows  
You've got thirty days  
To pack your bags  
Say goodbye, hit the road  
  
You work your fingers to the bone

I came 'round to your front door, your back door was locked  
Pushed your button, rang your bell, you didn't hear me knock  
I saw your window open wide, so I crawled inside  
I ran to the top floor, but you were on the ground  
I was on my way up and you were going down  
  
Fire in the basement  
Burn me up, scream and shout  
There's fire in the basement  
Only you can put it out  
  
This strange sensation that I'm going through  
Sweet infatuation when I get next to you  
I know what it takes to be a man, you understand  
'Cause when the sparks start flying you'll never be the same  
You know I'll hate to leave you girl but I'm so glad I came  
  
Fire in the basement  
Burn me up, scream and shout  
Fire in the basement  
Only you can put it out  
  
Smoky eyes burning bright  
Innocence lost, satisfy my appetite  
Surrender to the flame, what's your name  
Let's get down to business, how can you refuse  
Give this boy a helping hand, come on light my fuse

The golden light above you shows me where you're from  
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon  
You stand up on your hill, behop all around you  
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah  
They wonder where I found you  
  
Oh my love it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way  
  
I tried to understand you, I tried to love you right  
The way you smile and touch me always sets my heart alight  
Your lips are like a fire burning through my soul  
And people ask me where you're from  
They really wanna know  
  
Oh my soul it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way  
  
Magic woman wreckin' up my soul  
Things you tell me have never been told  
Magic woman I don't know  
Electric before me, I love you so, I love you so  
  
You're racing like a fireball dancing like a ghost  
You're Gemini and I don't know which one I like the most  
My head is getting broken and my mind is getting bust  
But now I'm coming with you down the road of golden dust  
  
Oh my love it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way  
  
The golden light above you show me where you're from  
The magic in your eye bewitches all you gaze upon  
You stand up on your hill, behop all around you  
They wonder where you're from, oh yeah  
They wonder where I found you  
  
Oh my love it's a long way  
Where you're from it's a long way

Spread the word around  
The rat is leaving town  
The message is a song  
The misery is gone  
  
Once I had a dream  
To sing before the queen  
She didn't want to know  
She wouldn't see the show  
  
What a fright  
I couldn't do it right  
Oh what a night  
  
Mystic demons fly  
All about the sk  
With memories of a clown  
The saddest show in town  
  
When I was seventeen  
Me mother said to me  
Be careful what you touch  
You shouldn't take so much  
  
I blew my mind  
She was so kind  
I could have cried  
  
In my mind  
I had to fin  
A kind of new way  
Of being oh so cool  
Like a blue blooded  
Well studded  
English fool  
  
Speak about the past  
Times are changing fast  
Once I was so weak  
I couldn't even speak  
  
Shaking put a curse  
Nothing could be worse  
Walking through the door  
Who could ask for more  
  
Now I'm free  
And I can see  
That I am me  
  
Spread the word around  
The rat is leaving town  
The message is a song  
The misery is gone  
  
Shaking out a curse  
Nothing could be worse  
Walking through the door  
Who could ask for more  
  
Now I'm free  
And I can see  
That I am me  
  
Please stay away

I'm crying I'm dying  
  
I can see what's wrong with me  
It's in my head  
  
I can see what's gonna be  
As I lie in my bed  
  
Man is not my brotherhood  
I am of the dead  
  
I died as I lived as I loved and was born  
On some distant hill  
  
The reasons to hide were the reasons I cried  
Fools pass laughing still  
  
There can be bad blood in all I can see  
It's in my brain  
  
You don't know the pain I feel  
As I must live again  
  
Rocks and stones can't bruise my soul but  
Tears will leave a stain  
  
They smile to themselves as they lay down my head  
On some distant hill  
  
The blind and the child sweep a tear from their eye  
Fools smile as they kill  
  
I got my own way to go and now I want  
To take your minds  
  
I believe if you could see  
The blood between the lines  
  
I believe that you could be  
A better kind  
  
Please lead the way so the unborn can play  
On some greener hill  
  
Laugh as the flames eat their burning remains  
Fools die laughing still

Cast your eyes into the crystal  
Deep inside the mystery  
Is that a vision of a lonely man  
I fear it looks a lot like me  
Is that a man without a woman  
Whose empty life is but a shell  
Empty hearts will echo  
Forever in the wishing well  
  
Fortuneteller  
You've got to help me find an end to the nightmare  
'Cause I can't stand this pain and the curse of time  
Somewhere in your eyes I'll find the answer  
Give me the truth I've been looking for  
Be my guiding light, I'll take my chances  
Turn the card, seal my fate, close the door  
  
Some days come with a vengeance  
Some days I feel so bad  
The mirror holds no secrets  
I lost the best thing that I had  
  
Fortuneteller  
Can you help me to see, is there an end to the sorrow  
Or was this slow ride to nowhere always meant to be  
Somewhere in your eyes I'll find the answer  
Give me the truth I've been looking for  
Be my guiding light, I'll take my chances  
Turn the card, seal my fate, close the door  
  
She always taking more than she'd need  
But we were both to blame somehow  
In the heat of the moment I told her to leave  
I guess I lost more than I found  
But I remember

All I wish, that I wasn't here  
Don't you know, I've got a rotten feeling  
Of dizzy heights  
Its what they want you know  
Oh well here I go  
  
What a funny show  
  
Take my time, it's the odds that count  
Who am I? What a silly sound  
Hold my breath, talk of sudden death  
Rhyme and reason must prevail  
I need a glass of ale  
  
I've gotta feeling now  
No need for me to tell you how  
It's really kind of easy now  
Woa, like rock n' roll  
  
It's gonna be alright  
It's funky and it's outta sight  
Feeling good, feeling right  
It's gonna be alright

Watch him ride into the sunset  
He'd have the little fat guy  
Right along his side  
Echoing off the canyon, Hey Cisco  
From Pancho 'n' pretty soon  
The black sombrero would reply  
Hey Pancho what's happening mi amigo  
It's getting somewhere near the end,  
This winding trail  
When we've raced around the corner  
For the final dusty time  
Mr Renaldo 'n' Carillo's  
Going to jail  
  
Can't open no more supermarkets  
Duncan's sombrero's hanging  
Up there with his guns  
Some cigarro sucking slag  
Under a cheap Hollywood chandelier  
Says 'Cisco, Kid you know  
Your day is done  
Let me know how you are doin'  
Mr. Renaldo  
If you need me I could be  
A friend for life  
There don't seem any point  
We should throw 'way  
All these years  
Why don't we saddle up  
And ride out one more time  
  
What they doing to my friend  
What they doing to my man  
Don't matter when  
I'll stay to the end  
Hey Cisco  
Let's go out in style  
We're going down together

Hey Joe  
Where you going with that gun in your hand  
Hey Joe  
Now tell me where you going with that gun in your hand  
I'm gonna shoot my lady  
'cause I caught her messing around with another man  
Yes, I'm going down to shoot my lady  
'cause I caught her messing around with another man  
  
Hey Joe  
I heard you shot your woman down  
Hey Joe  
I heard you shot your woman down  
Right down to the ground  
Yes I did I shot her  
  
Yes I did I shot her  
I shot my woman 'cause she was messing 'round town  
  
I gave her the gun, I shot her!  
Hey Joe  
Tell me where you gonna run to now?  
Hey Joe  
C'mon tell me where you gonna run to?  
Don't you worry about me  
I'm going way down south  
Way down south where I'm gonna be free  
I'm going way down south  
Way down south maybe outside Mexico way  
I'm gonna run, oh yeah

Nobody gonna take my car, I'm gonna race it to the ground  
Nobody gonna beat my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound  
Ooh it's a killing machine, it's got everything  
Like a driving power, big fat tires and everything  
  
I love it, and I need it, I feed it  
Yeah it's a wild hurricane  
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my girl I'm gonna keep her to the end  
Nobody gonna have my girl she stays close on every bend  
Ooh she's a killing machine, she's got everything  
Like a moving mouth, body control and everything  
  
I love her, I need her, I seed her  
Yeah she turns me on  
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my head I got speed inside my brain  
Nobody gonna steal my head now that I'm on the road again  
Ooh I'm in heaven again I've got everything  
Like a moving ground, an open road and everything  
  
I love it, I need it, I bleed it  
Eight cylinders all mine  
Alright hold tight, I'm a highway star  
  
Nobody gonna take my car, I'm gonna race it to the ground  
Nobody gonna beat my car, it's gonna break the speed of sound  
Ooh it's a killing machine, it's got everything  
Like a driving power, big fat tires and everything  
  
I'm a highway star, I'm a highway star

You're sweeter than the morning  
When the sun is shining down on me  
There is nothing you can say  
That could make me go away you see  
But you keep saying to me baby  
  
Hold on,  
I feel I'm getting ready  
Hold on,  
I feel I'm rockin' steady  
Hold on,  
I'm gonna make it with you woman  
Hold on,  
You got to gimme some love, gimme some love  
  
I held back before  
But your love took me easily  
You got the power  
I knew was gonna creep up on me  
The more I give  
Your love keeps comin' on strong  
Although it's mine now  
I know it won't be for long  
There's something in the saying  
That a woman needs a little more time  
I'm getting tired of waiting for you  
Giving me some kind of sign  
  
Hold on  
I've got to love you when I want to  
Hold on  
You've got to love me when I want you to  
Hold on  
I ain't gonna let you leave me baby  
Hold on  
No never no more  
  
I know the game you're playing  
And I guess you think I'm easily led  
You think the words you're saying  
Are really going through my head  
I'm gonna take you home  
And give you all I can  
I'll prove to you, baby  
That really I'm a man  
  
Hold on  
I know I'm feeling ready  
Hold on  
I know I'm rockin' steady  
Hold on  
Guess I've made it with you woman  
Hold on  
I've got you giving me love  
  
Something that you give me  
Keeps me hangin' on  
No use me stayin'  
There's nothing to be done  
I'm gonna take you home  
And give you all I can  
I'll prove to you woman  
That really I'm a man  
  
Hold on  
I only want to take you higher  
Hold on  
You are the root of my desire  
Hold on  
c'mon baby light my fire  
Hold on

Have you ever had a woman that could make you crazy  
Have you ever had a woman that could drive you mad  
Have you ever had a woman give you so much trouble  
And the best lovin' you ever had  
  
My friends all say I'm losing it big time  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
Back to the house of pain  
  
Have you ever had a rock that just keeps on rollin'  
Have you ever seen a train comin' down the track  
Have you ever jumped into the cold, cold never  
And know there's no turning back  
  
My friends all say I'm crazy, baby  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going home  
Back to the house of pain  
  
Have you ever had a weight that was much too heavy  
Have you ever had a burden that was yours alone  
Have you ever spent a night when you keep on waiting  
Staring at the telephone  
  
My friends all say I'm crazy, baby  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back to my woman  
Back to the house of pain  
Then I run away  
  
My friends all say I'm losing it big time  
But I know where I've got to go  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
I'm going back there again  
Back to the house of pain  
  
You'll always be my inspiration  
I love you from afar

In a dark and sweaty room in '69  
Tables turning  
Dancing girls, silly girls, all kinds of girls  
And it was loud  
Tuning up to madness in the back room  
Candles burning  
Present the Stinking Hippy and throw the  
Naked thunder to the crowd  
In the Hungry Daze  
  
The long and lonely highway drags along  
It's going nowhere  
Sickness and disease and mad  
Corruption  
Something's going wrong  
The mountain's getting cold and lonely  
The trees are bare  
We all came out to Montreux  
But that's another song  
You've heard it all before  
In hungry daze  
  
Along the Mountain Road to do some  
Drinking  
And now we're mobile again  
Different girls, laughing girls, forever  
Girls  
And it's so loud  
The crew have lost again  
They are beaten men  
The winning team united  
Living for the crowd  
These are the hungry daze

You're lazy just stay in bed  
You're lazy just stay in bed  
You don't want no money  
You don't want no bread  
  
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw  
If you're drowning you don't clutch no straw  
You don't want to live you don't want to cry no more  
  
Well my trying ain't done no good  
I said my trying ain't done no good  
You don't make no effort no not like you should  
  
Lazy you just stay in bed  
Lazy you just stay in bed  
You don't want no money  
You don't want no bread

My shoes are heavy  
My feet are winding down  
I look for her in corners  
But she's not around  
What I eat is eating me  
It hits me hard  
I'm one jack short of a royal flush  
A stranger holds the card  
Here come the salvation in the shape of my guitar  
And I'm gonna ride it like a shooting star  
  
I don't want your money  
I don't want your soul  
I don't need a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
  
Mother Mercy told me  
A picture never lies  
She told me no self respecting hero ever cries  
The prisoner walks in circles  
The victim walks alone  
Scissors cut the paper  
The paper wraps the stone  
Standing at the entrance to the gates of paradise  
The lights go down, the heat goes up, that's when I cry  
  
I don't want your money  
I don't want your soul  
I don't a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
  
I put my faith in fortune reaching for the sky  
The only game in town that gets me high  
  
I don't want your money  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
I don't want your soul  
I just want to get right down and lick it up  
I don't need a reason  
I just want to get right down and lick it up

In ages past when spells were cast  
In a time of men in steel  
When a man was taught no special thing  
It was all done by feel  
  
So listen, so learn, so read on  
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
Hear the song of lovely Joan  
Her sound so sweet and clear  
In the courtroom of the King  
Among children and the peers  
  
So listen, so learn, so read on  
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
"Now hear ye the words of Taliesyn,  
On the foaming beach of the ocean,  
In the day of trouble,  
I shall be of more service to thee  
Than three hundred salmon"  
  
The hare he bounds across the page  
Past castles white and fair  
Past dreaming chessmen on their boards  
With a fool's mate as a snare  
  
So listen, so learn, so read on  
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
"Three times I have been born  
I know this from meditation"  
  
The bird he flies the distance  
From pages two to six  
Past minstrels in their boxes  
To the waters of the Styx  
  
So listen, so learn, so read on  
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
Don't take the pictures lightly  
Listen to their sound  
For from their coloured feeling  
Experience is found  
  
So listen, so learn, so read on  
You gotta turn the page, read the Book of Taliesyn  
  
"All the sciences of the world are collected in my breast,  
For I know what has been, what is now,  
And what hereafter will occur"

You came along for a weekend  
But you only stayed for one night  
You took off your hair, you pulled out your teeth  
Oh I almost died of fright  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck  
  
You said you were a virgin  
Full of promise and mystery  
But I knew that you would bring me down  
'Cos everyone calls you big G  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck  
  
You said you're gonna love me  
You said you're gonna set me free  
But I knew that you would bring me down  
And cause me misery  
  
You'd better do something for your own sake  
Yes it's a shame  
Ah you know you're a living wreck

Wake up in the morning  
Get into bed  
Closing my eyes  
I rest my head  
  
There is no arrangement  
No time no place  
It's gone in the wind  
And left no trace  
  
Who can say,  
maybe or whatever.  
It's up to you  
You know you can trust me  
I'll make it up to you  
  
You move with the action  
You loosen my strings  
Your fingers can smooth out my jangles  
And all those things  
  
Grease on the handle  
and the tangles in my hair  
They always seem to go together  
I don't care

You can walk through fire  
Make the north wind blow  
Squeeze 'n' tease me honey  
When you shake your body  
You move my soul  
Let me be your lover  
Won't you let me be your child  
Take me through your universe  
Ya'know that when you smile  
You drive me wild  
  
Love child  
Driving me wild  
Love child  
Always teasin' me  
  
You can ride your pony  
Day dream in fairy tales  
All I know is I need more  
When I see you dance the seven veils

Feels like the end  
When you're closer to losing your dreams  
Than losing a friend  
Flying blind  
I'm shooting into the dark  
Who will I find?  
Oh girl  
And if it takes me a lifetime  
I swear I'll tear down every wall  
Love conquers all  
  
On my way  
Tomorrow I rise with the sun  
Soon I'll be gone  
Words can't say  
How the memories of feelings of love  
They linger on  
Oh girl  
And if it takes me forever  
I know it's worth every teardrop that falls  
Love conquers all  
  
Somewhere there's a place in your heart  
Where the wounds never heal  
Well you're not alone  
That's just how I feel  
  
Love conquers all  
This one will last a lifetime  
And if love conquers all  
This one will last forever

If I work hard every day  
For my money  
If I work my finger down to the bone  
That ain't funny  
Now if I see  
Something I can't buy  
I put a dollar down  
Then I try try try  
To get my money  
I need my money  
A woman who ain't got a dime  
I can't use her no  
If she ain't got no cash money  
I've got to refuse her  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
So she help me, baby  
Help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
I've got to have money  
  
I need lovin' to give me a livin'  
So don't ask me I don't need forgivin'  
I will stand up to count the cost  
But I know I won't stand the loss  
  
I need a woman  
With a whole lotta will  
She can help me pay my bill  
I need my money  
I want my money  
Before I say my prayers  
I count my money  
When I wake up  
It has to be there  
My money  
You see, love, it don't mean a thing  
When she loves you  
She can't bring, can't bring you no money  
I've got to have my money  
  
Lookin' for lovin'  
I need a livin'

Vibrant flashes in my mind  
Remind me of a foregone time  
The blackened faces, broken romance  
Blackened faces  
  
My broken heart has bled  
With memories of a love that's dead  
Sometimes happy then sad  
I need love, love help me  
  
Passing by the grounds of time  
Memories that are only mine  
Looking for love, a brand new love  
Looking for love  
  
Dreams that are hard to see  
Finding a new love for me  
Someday she must come along  
I need love, love help me  
  
I need love to come home  
Somewhere there must be one  
  
Hoping someday for good news  
Waiting for that girl to choose  
Only hoping, all I can do  
Only hoping  
  
One day she must come along  
A girl as pretty as a song  
A woman just meant for me  
I need love, love help me  
  
Vibrant flashes in my mind  
Remind me of a foregone time  
The blackened faces, broken romance  
Blackened faces  
  
My broken heart has bled  
With memories of a love that's dead  
Sometimes happy then sad  
I need love, love help me  
  
I need love, love help me

At the Butterfly Ball

Mary Long is a hypocrite  
She does all the things that she tells us not to do  
Selling filth from a corner shop  
And knitting patterns to the high street queue  
She paints roses, even makes them smell good  
And then she draws titties on the khazy wall  
Drowns kittens just to get a thrill  
And writes sermons in the Sunday Chronicle  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?  
  
Mary told Johnny not to write such trash  
Said it was a waste of public money  
She made a fuss, they made apologies  
But everybody thought the show was funny  
When the nation knew you'd had children  
It came as such a surprise  
We really didn't know you'd had it in you  
How you did it we can only surmise  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?  
  
Mary Long, you're not alone  
But you're a long way behind our times  
What we do in full frontal view  
Is more honest than your clean-up mind  
What I'm saying, Mary Long is  
When you can spare a minute  
Go find your friend the porny Lord  
Dig your self a hole and jump in it  
  
How did you lose your virginity, Mary Long?  
When will you lose your stupidity, Mary Long?

She came home last night rotten rolling drunk  
She talk no sense but she sound good  
So she think So I reached over and said,  
"Hello, is there some planet you'd care to go"  
And she said "Venus on the rocks"  
  
She got a mean streak  
Black Mamba don't compete  
She got a mean streak  
Temptation bitter sweet  
  
She drives me crazy gets inside my brain  
She spend my money down a drain  
So I roll over for my reward  
How much can I afford  
And she says  
"Just a little more"  
  
I can't take this no more  
I tried so hard but I can't get thro' the door  
Because one smile from those eyes  
And I stand there paralyzed  
And she says  
"Beg for more get down sucka you know what I like"  
Oh hang on  
  
She got a mean streak  
Black Mamba don't compete  
She got a mean streak  
Temptation bitter sweet

I've been mistreated, I've been abused.  
I've been struck downhearted, baby, I've been confused  
'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.  
Since my baby left me I've been losing my mind, you know I have.  
  
I've been lonely, I've been cold.  
I've been looking for a woman to have and hold  
'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated.  
Since my baby left me I've been losing, I've been losing,  
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe.  
  
I've been mistreated, I've been abused.  
I've been looking for a woman, yeh, I've been confused  
'cause I know, yes, I know I've been mistreated, ooh o-o-oh.  
Since my baby left me I've been losing, losing,  
I've been losing my mind, baby baby babe.  
Oh oh oh, oh woman, oh woman, oh woman.  
  
I've been losing my mind.

Flying to Salt Lake City  
Seats 3a and be  
I was down and needed  
A window  
But in 3a sat Mitzi Dupree  
She said hi I am Mitzi  
The queen of the ping pong  
Where you going boy  
I said nowhere  
She said I'm moving on  
I thought what is this  
I cannot resist  
Here she is  
And I've always wanted a girl  
With a name  
A name like Mitzi Dupree  
  
She said what do you do  
I said I'm a singer in a band  
She said ya I'm an entertainer  
Reached out and took my hand  
She was going to a mining town  
Way up north to do her show  
I said it must be cold up there  
She said depends on who you know  
Oh that look in her eye  
I can tell you no lies  
I'm just a man  
She made me feel like a king in my mind  
I love you Mitzi Dupree  
  
I said what is this queen of the ping pong business  
She smiled what do you think  
It has no connection with china  
I said ow have another drink  
Well I knew right away  
That I'd seen her act before  
In a room behind a kitchen in Bangkok  
And three or four times more in Singapore  
She may not be the first  
But I know she ain't the worst  
She was mine but I ran out of time  
I miss you I love you Mitzi Dupree  
My darling Mitzi Dupree

I was young and healthy  
Extremely wealthy  
I swung in the trees  
And did as I pleased  
I thought I was rich  
Oh yeah  
Such sweet seduction  
I could feel the suction  
Greasing my palm  
And doing no harm  
Just making some deals  
What a bitch  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
I had rising stock  
So I got more pockets  
I knew somewhere to stick it  
Where no-one would nick it  
I kinda went private  
And then, aha  
Such sweet seclusion  
No more intrusion  
Too much food on my plate  
But there's guards at the gate  
Such joy  
I could almost die of it  
  
Money talks to me  
Lays it on the line  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
  
Money goes to money  
Yes it always returns  
Finds its way back to the big house  
Where it lives all alone  
Wraith like silent partners  
Operators of the system  
Give words of quiet assurance  
To an otherwise healthy victim  
  
It's all coming back to me  
I would swing in the trees  
And I'd swim in the ocean  
I used to show some emotion  
  
I was not to blame  
I feel no shame  
The structure was shaking  
Was there for the taking  
I had the resources  
But then, oh no  
Someone outbid me  
I can't take it with me?  
Then I will devour it  
I can't go without it  
It's simply a question of  
Market forces  
  
Money talks to me  
Whispers in my ear  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want  
Money talks to me  
Laughs right in my face  
Gives me everything I want  
Everything I want

I was driving through the night  
Into an endless tunnel of fog  
When it dawned on me something was wrong  
I was in a trance, hypnotized  
Bored beyond belief  
I was listening to the same old song  
I know every lick, every word  
Every nuance  
I'm on first name terms with the crew  
But I'd better get used to this poop du jour  
Sure as hell they won't play anything new  
  
Oh yes I love you really  
Classic Rock Radio  
Oh my dear it's time for bed  
Time for you to go  
Everyone is asleep  
  
The pirates took to water, stole the charts  
But sadly that didn't go down well with those upstairs  
Who require loyalty  
The establishment considered  
That the uncontrolled appreciation of music  
Was a danger to royalty  
The mighty empire roared  
As Cash 'n' Everett on the high seas  
Looked like they'd get blown out of the water  
They did of course eventually come ashore  
As meek as mice or to be more accurate  
As lambs to the slaughter  
  
Oh yes I love you really  
I stand to attention  
Oh Fanny, I love you dearly  
Something else I should mention?  
You sweet thing  
  
Let's not talk about MTV  
I don't even want to start  
I want to take a look at Classic Rock Radio  
We're talking about the state of the art  
  
Mr Grover 'n' Mr Gillian  
You musta made a million  
The night that Frank Zappa caught on fire  
Could you tell us all about it  
Keep it short and use my version  
Or everyone out there'll think I'm a liar  
We can speak about Bananas for one second  
Just because I understand  
You have to get them off your chest  
But in the meantime while your talking  
Could you do some more of these here ID's  
And then this station might maintain some interest  
  
Oh yes I love you dearly  
But why do you exist?  
Oh yes I love you really  
Is there something that I missed?

I got my feelers out  
Pleasure I can give you pain  
I'm the demon of misfortune  
Let me tell you that bad luck is my game  
Fires burning make you cold  
You can touch but you can't hold  
It's an even split  
Between zip and the number on your ticket  
Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt  
I'm a nasty piece of work  
  
Down get down on your knees  
Running gonna bring you down  
I'm the demon of disorder  
You know I'm gonna drive you into the ground  
As you're stepping through the door  
My shadow crawls across your floor  
Your dream of love  
It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing  
You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse  
I'm nasty nasty  
  
It's an even split  
Between zip and the number on your ticket  
Your dream of love  
It's not enough it's gonna come to nothing  
Nothing to brag about dragging in the dirt  
You ain't seen nothing it's gonna get worse  
I'm a nasty piece of work

Never a word, a word so true  
Passed between us, me and you  
Heard you found your pot of gold  
That's the story I've been told  
  
Never a word was said in vain  
Some were never sad again  
Some were lost in lovers' heat  
Some lay fallen at our feet  
  
All day all night  
You and only you  
All day all night  
I think of you and only you  
  
Never a word escaped my lips  
Silenced by your fingertips  
I kept my word, can you believe  
All this time so hard to breathe  
Hard to breathe

Somebody Somebody  
Come to my side  
I'm tired I'm crying  
I'm sick inside  
My woman that woman  
Just wasn't right  
  
Help me now please my friend  
I never felt so bad before  
Never never before  
  
So funny so funny  
Just like a show  
One name two people  
All in a row  
Somebody Somebody  
Someone must go  
  
Help me now please my friend  
I never felt so bad before  
Never never before  
  
I was hurt when I was younger  
By a woman who was cold  
She took my name  
She took my body  
And she threw away my soul  
  
Can't hide I can't hide my misery  
I know my sorrow won't set me free  
She did it d'you see she did it to me  
  
Help me now please my friend  
I never felt so bad before  
Never never before

Really hate the running really hate the game  
Looking at them all I want to be unborn again  
Their suit is getting tighter although they're getting thin  
The flies are crawling on their face and trying to get in  
  
People say that we're to blame I say  
No no no it's just the game  
Must we let them fool us no no no  
Have we got our freedom no no no  
Is it getting better no no no  
Do we love each other no no no  
Must we wait forever no no no no no  
  
Heads are getting stronger bodies getting weak  
Looking at them all it feels good to be a freak  
Their hands are getting closer they're reaching out so far  
The greenies gonna get them make them serve stars  
Tell them how it is and they say  
No no no we know it all  
The washing's getting dirty the air is getting thin  
It's all in such a mess that no one knows where to begin  
They talk about creating but all they do is kill  
They say we're gonna mend it but they never will  
Poison in the rain but they say  
No no no we ain't to blame

Maybe it's because I'm only starting  
That I think it won't take too long  
Maybe it's because I can see you laughing  
That I think you've got it wrong  
Maybe I could be like Robin Hood  
Like and outlaw dressed all in green  
Someone said what's he gonna turn out like  
And someone else said never mind  
Well I was big and bold and more than twice as old  
As all the cats I'd ever seen  
I grew my hair and bought a suit  
Of shiny white or was it cream  
I shook and shivered danced and quivered  
And stood on a mountain top  
  
No one came from miles around and said  
Man your music is really hot  
  
Well I knew what they meant because I was a freak  
My throat was tired and worn  
My pretty face just looked out of place  
As they poured on the scorn  
I wrote on yellow paper from a man who was the king  
He said my boy we'll have some crazy scenes  
There weren't any scenes at all like he was talkin' about  
He must've been the king of queens  
Well I could write a million songs about the things I've done  
But I could never sing them so they'd never get sung  
There's a law for the rich and one for the poor  
And there's another one for sing  
It's die young and live much longer  
Spend your money and sit and wonder  
  
No one came for miles around  
And said man your music is really funky  
  
I believe that I must tell the truth  
And say things as they really are  
But if I told the truth and nothing but the truth  
Could I ever be a star  
Nobody knows who's real and who's fakin'  
Everyone's shouting out loud  
It's only the glitter and shine that gets through  
Where's my Robin Hood outfit  
Well I've come and I've gone before you wink an eye  
No one ever cared enough to say goodbye  
The money's good and the time you have  
Fun and games galore  
But you spend your money and lie in bed forgotten  
And you wonder what you did it for  
  
No one came from miles around  
And said man who's he?

I hear they're trying to make us all the same  
It's mind control by any other name  
Who's gonna pay the price  
For this foolish paradise  
Oh Momma don't take that train  
  
I hear it said we're headed too far south  
Chinese whispers go by word of mouth  
Rules for every size and shape  
The nag has gone, shut the gate  
Once you're in you're never getting out  
  
I'm so misunderstood  
There goes my manhood  
She's in my face again  
With that picture of innocence  
  
No drinks, no smokes  
No dicking around  
No dirty jokes  
Straight lace, straight face  
The old straight jacket  
We got no hope  
  
I hear they're gonna try out something new  
I can feel it sticking to my shoe  
So this is what tomorrow holds  
Hopes and dreams are bought and sold  
But still the world is misty green and blue  
  
I, so misunderstood  
There goes my mannish boyhood  
She's in my face again  
With that picture of innocence  
  
No deals, no strokes  
No forbidden fruit  
No holy smoke  
What next, no sex  
That's the end of the road  
That's the end of the road  
We got no hope  
  
No drinks, no smokes  
No dicking around  
No dirty jokes  
Straight lace, straight face  
The old straight jacket  
We got no hope  
  
No deals, no strokes  
No forbidden fruit  
No holy smoke  
What next, no sex  
That's the end of the road  
We got no hope

Somebody's shouting  
Up at a mountain  
Only my own words return  
Nobody's out there  
It's a deception  
When will I ever learn?  
  
I'm alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And whispering pictures of home  
  
Wondering blindly  
How can they find me  
Maybe they don't even know  
My body is shaking  
Anticipating  
The call of the black footed crow  
  
I'm alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And taunting with pictures of home  
  
Here in this prison  
Of my own making  
Year after day I have grown  
Into a hero  
But there's no worship  
Where have they hidden my throne?  
  
I'm alone here  
With emptiness eagles and snow  
Unfriendliness chilling my body  
And screaming out pictures of home

I'm living in this line  
I know my place, could think of no way  
Of edging along in a loser's race  
The line was moving slowly  
Day by night  
Everybody's shuffling on to keep a place in the line  
  
Nine long years I've been in line  
Getting nowhere there is no reason  
For this line I don't care.  
Everybody's standing in the burning sun  
Everybody's shuffling on keeping a place in the line  
  
Don't you think we're gonna make it  
We've got a place in line  
We're gonna make it some time  
Somehow

My clothes don't fit and I have no point of view  
I got a bad reputation but I don't believe it's true  
I had something going but I blew it down the can  
Not exactly what I planned  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am  
  
I look like a joker but I feel like a one eyed jack  
Shuffling around never get to the top of the park  
I said to the dealer put the ace in my hand  
But he couldn't give a damn  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am  
  
I sit down thinking bout the things I have to do  
I start out fine then I pick up something new  
Stumbled through the door that's how it all began  
Now it's buried in the sand  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am  
  
The stars shine bright when the boys come out to play  
Never feeling more than I'm feeling right here today  
I used to be fresh but now I'm second hand  
I do what I can  
  
I'm a ramshackle man  
That's what I am

I told you once about a place  
That I had accidentally stumbled upon  
Can you imagine how it feels to find somewhere  
That you can do no wrong  
But it's alright you're safe in my hands  
  
I'll meet you in the sky tonight  
And we will trace some undiscovered stars  
We'll go beyond the universe beyond all understanding,  
Hey, it's not that far  
But it's alright I feel safe in your hands  
  
I can't stand living this way  
Getting by from day to day  
I'm drinking from your loving cup  
I told you things were looking cup  
Oh oh oh so good  
Oh it feels so good  
  
We're all the same but then again  
We're all quite different in our own peculiar ways  
We've come so far and now we're going through another phase  
But it's alright  
We made it so far  
  
I can't stand living this way  
Getting by from day to day  
I'm drinking from your loving cup  
Told you things were looking cup  
  
As we all know it's hard to breathe  
When something spiritual has taken place  
We don't know why we don't know how  
We've been transformed into a state of grace  
But it's alright  
We walk in our sleep  
Yes it's alright  
This is rapture of the deep

Hey baby, what you gonna do  
When the lights go up on you?  
What's your name, can I drive you home?  
Sweet woman, are you all alone?  
You're the one for me  
I'm gonna keep you busy as a bee, could bee, could be  
Rat bat blue  
  
Now, get up woman, don't be slow  
It's getting late and I wanna go  
No cause for acting big  
Got to love, got to live  
Stick around with me  
I'm gonna show you things you never thought you'd see,  
You see  
Rat bat blue  
You're so fine  
  
Get out!  
You didn't understand  
I'm a hard loving man  
No way you can satisfy  
The way you look, the way you lie  
And when you shut the door  
Make sure I don't see you 'round here no more  
Rat bat blue  
Alright

I don't have the time of day  
I don't know what day I is  
Someone's falling on my head  
Get up? Get up  
We're going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
To me it don't matter  
It's where I belong  
It's a matter of distinction  
A real fine line  
Between an orgy of destruction  
And a wonderful time  
  
This room's so cold and bare  
There's nothing here for me  
I've got to find some heat somewhere  
Get up? Get up  
We're going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
It really doesn't matter  
When I'm bangin' on a gong  
While someone's holding out  
To a willing congregation  
And we can all forget about  
The state of the nation  
  
Can't hear a thing  
But I see your lips are moving  
I'm working on my thinking  
And I think it's improving  
I'm going to get the blame  
So I might as well deliver  
If only I can swim across  
This weird human river  
  
I know I started out  
With the best of intentions  
Some blinding inspiration  
And a few not-to-mention  
And now I'm looking deep  
Into the last dying embers  
Shouting what are we doing here  
And nobody remembers  
  
I've lost a friend or two  
I don't know where they have gone  
Only one thing I can do  
Get up? Get up  
I'm going out on the raz  
  
Razzle dazzle  
Call it what you want  
To me it don't matter  
It's where I belong  
It's a matter of distinction  
A real fine line  
Between an orgy of destruction  
And a wonderful time

When you were a young girl  
Did you have a rag doll, the only doll you've ever owned?  
Now I'll love you just the way you loved that rag doll  
Only now my love has grown  
  
Oh, and it gets stronger as the river flows  
Deeper baby, heaven knows  
Higher, as it goes  
  
Do I love you, my oh my?  
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Do I love you, would I cry?  
Oh I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
When you were a young girl  
Did you have a puppy, that always followed you around?  
Well I'm gonna be as faithful as that puppy  
No I'll never never let you down  
  
'cause it gets stronger as the river flows  
And it gets deeper baby, heaven knows  
It gets higher, so higher, as it goes  
  
Do I love you, my oh my?  
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Do I love you, would I cry?  
Oh I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
Well I love you baby like a flower loves the spring  
And I love you baby like a robin likes to sing  
And I love you baby like a schoolboy likes his pie  
Oh and I love you baby  
River deep, mountain high  
  
Do I love you, my oh my?  
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Do I love you, would I cry?  
Oh I love you baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
Do I love you, my oh my?  
River deep, mountain high, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Do I love you, would I cry?  
Oh I love you baby, baby, baby, baby

Going to Rosa's Cantina  
Going to Rosa's Cantina  
Hoping that she's still there  
Going to Rosa's Cantina  
  
Might have been  
The dust in my eyes  
The dust in my eyes  
  
Could have been the neon cactus  
Lighting up the desert sky  
Must have been  
The dust in my eyes  
  
Some would call it suicide  
Some would call it suicide  
I would call it paradise  
Some would call it suicide  
  
Dancing on the table  
Dancing on the table  
Dancing on the table  
When she's  
Drunker than she's able  
Dancing on the table  
  
Some would call it suicide  
I would call it paradise  
Some would call it suicide  
Some would call it hell on earth  
  
Is she right is she wrong  
Will she sing another song  
Wicked as it seems  
Right now  
  
Rosa wants her baby back  
Rosa wants her baby back  
Since he's gone she's losing track  
Rosa wants her baby back  
  
Careful with that cadillac  
Careful with that cadillac  
Careful with that cadillac

If you're driftin' on an empty ocean  
With no wind to fill your sail,  
The future, your horizon,  
It's like searchin' for the Holy Grail.  
You feel there's no tomorrow,  
As you look into the water below.  
It's only your reflection,  
And you still ain't got no place to go.  
  
Time will show,  
When, I don't know.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
I'll be there someday yea-yea-yeah yea-ye-yeah.  
  
Oh woman I keep returnin,  
To sing the same old song.  
The story's been told, now I'm gettin' old.  
Tell me, where do I belong?  
Feel like I'm goin' to surrender.  
Hard times I've had enough.  
If I could find a place, to hide my face,  
I believe, I could get back up.  
  
Time will show,  
When, I don't know.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
But I'll be there someday yea-yea-yeah yea-yea-yea-yeah.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
But I'll be there someday yea-yea-yeah yea-yea-yea-yeah.  
  
Sail away tomorrow,  
Sailin' far away.  
To find it steal or borrow.  
But I'll be there someday yeah yeah yeah yea-yea-yeah yeah yeah yeah.

(coverdale)  
If I could see before my time ends  
The smile you gave me before the pain  
I could accept the world of darkness  
Never see the sun again...  
Never ever gonna leave ya,  
So dry your eyes and smile again  
Say the words I need to hear...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
Say that you need me,  
I can't take it anymore...  
But I know I must be strong,  
To keep belive in right or wrong...  
I've got time but I can't wait too long  
Wanna get you home where you belong...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
I can't take it anymore...  
Say you love me, baby, baby, baby  
Say you love me...  
Say that you need me, I can't take it anymore...  
Say you love me, say you love me  
I can't take it, I can't take it anymore...  
Say you love me, oh baby  
Say you love me...  
Say that you need me, I can't take it anymore...  
I can't take it anymore...  

I've been to places where  
The sun goes down  
Each day and never rises  
I've been to places in  
A dark room  
Where we played  
With our disguises  
  
Heaven  
I'm in heaven  
I'm in seventh heaven now  
Seventh heaven  
  
It was a dream I heard a voice  
I put it down to wishful thinking  
It was a dream a silent scream  
Out of the blue a new beginning  
  
Heaven  
I'm in heaven  
I'm in seventh heaven now  
Seventh heaven  
  
And then I fell upon  
A stroke of luck  
That led to my good fortune  
And then I fell upon my knees  
And gently kissed the ground  
You walk on  
  
Heaven  
I'm in heaven  
I'm in seventh heaven now  
Seventh heaven

You think by leaving me the sun will go away  
You think that if you go there'll be no other way  
But your leaving now won't even spoil my day  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
You keep a-waiting for the tears I'm supposed to cry  
The promise leaves so I'm supposed to die  
I'd forgotten who you were until you dropped on by  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
You think I'm guilty throwing off the likes of you  
That there'll be no one else but there'll be quite a few  
At least I've got my health and somehow I'll pull through  
  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  
Oh no no no  

She was she was  
She was all that she said she was  
She was all that she said she was  
I couldn't want for more  
But all I want is more  
I just want her more and more  
And more and more and more  
But she's untouchable  
  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down  
And then she's lovable  
  
Who were you with last night?  
Who were you with last night?  
Were you thinking of me?  
And were you thinking of me?  
Unforgivable sin unforgivable sin  
Unforgivable  
You're untouchable  
  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down  
  
She coming my way  
She coming my way  
I don't know what to say  
She coming my way  
She fading away  
She fading away  
And I lay my head down  
I lay my head down

Well I'm standing here on moving station  
All the world is traveling by  
To strange outlandish destinations  
There they go, I wonder why  
  
I may be crazy  
But I'm no stupid  
I get along  
I use my silver tongue  
  
You know I can dream in any language  
Flying on my magic bed  
And I don't need to work my passage  
All I do is use my head  
  
I may be crazy  
But I'm no stupid  
Sometimes I ramble  
Then I'm Lucid  
I might seem lazy  
But I'm hurting no-one  
I get along  
I use my silver tongue  
  
I know exactly what you're thinking  
But you don't know what's in my mind  
You went too fast and now your sinking  
Because you forgot to read the signs

I'm just passing time before the Ball  
Playing my guitar  
I don't have to be where I don't want to be at all  
Maybe I'll go far  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Ah, in a dream  
Sitting in a landscape full of sighs  
Dream away the day  
Making up a tune about the blueness of the skies  
This is where I'll stay  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Oh, in a dream  
Watching as a red and white balloon  
Sails across my mind  
In between the images that drift along my tune  
Smile as they unwind  
Going nowhere, sitting in a dream...  
Ah, in a dream

Go to the woman like a switchblade knife  
Baby says we're gonna break the law tonight  
Ooh...if your daddy could see you now  
Rock'n'Roll rebel on a jailbreak run  
This operator but a little high strung  
There's one in every crowd  
You got coming to you, it happens every time  
That's what you get for a life of crime  
You got it coming to you, if you cross the line  
And you can't back up, when the going gets tough  
And if you fly that high you'd better get some...  
Slow down sister, you're burn, burn, burnin', at the speed of light  
Better slow down sister  
Put on tile brakes or you won't get through the night  
She don't love you, gonna shoot to thrill  
I tell you that little girl's kiss could kill  
She got me standing on a one way street  
Can't break the chains, the ties that bind  
Slave to the rhythm and my heart's in time  
Beware the taste is bittersweet  
When the lights go down, and you hit the ground  
It'll happen so fast,....  
Slow down sister  
I said look out now, danger in a little girl's eyes  
Slow down sister  
Well you're gonna find out there's trouble in paradise  
..that ain't nice...  
You'll never stop... your butterfly ball  
....in the black, you think you've done it all  
Come on now baby, you know it's true  
You want all the money and the price of fame  
Ride to glory on another man's name  
Now there's a lesson here for you  
You'd better slow down sister  
I said look out now, there's danger in a little girl's eyes  
Slow down sister, slow down ,slow down  
Well you're gonna find out there's trouble..trouble in paradise  
I said slow!  

How can you live in such a state?  
Your mind is empty and you're full of hate  
The things you say and the things you do  
Mark you down as a helpless fool  
I know, I know, I know, I know  
It's gonna be all right through the night  
Tomorrow comes and you're full of shame  
Oh baby! You play the crying game  
Aaaah...  
Gonna be a long time baby  
Before we get it sorted out all right  
I'll drag you out to Utopia, baby  
[? We'll end up heading?] south  
I need, I need, I need to know  
If you gonna do me right  
If you do the things I ask of you  
I'll tell the world tonight  
He he he he hee... All right  
You do me right, you do me wrong  
Tell me, where do I belong?  
You do me up, you do me down  
I accept it all without a frown  
You love like a woman in a fantasy  
Ha ha ha I admire you for my dream  
You dream of life and you dream of [???]  
High enough but I'm back again  
I love, I love, I love the funny ways  
Oh you throw me in a daze  
If you ever left me woman  
I'd destroy myself, sure as hell  
Aaaah...  
We're gonna ride a slow train baby  
And take all the whistles stops oh no - yes we are  
We'll put down the blinds while the carriage flies  
[? The engine burns hot?] while the fuzz is going on  
So I'll burn its [???] to ash  
Well there's a life to live and there's love to give  
Ready! Steady! Smash!  
Alright! Yeah! Uh mmh!  
You just got to be out of your head  
Whe you say you'll go look for the bottom of the top  
Well I'll be waiting and won't give it a rest  
[?????????????????????????????]  
[??????????????] something's going on  
And it's sure [???????]  
Just like me he

We all came out to Montreux  
On the Lake Geneva shoreline  
To make records with a mobile  
We didn't have much time  
Frank Zappa and the Mothers  
Were at the best place around  
But some stupid with a flare gun  
Burned the place to the ground  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  
  
They burned down the gambling house  
It died with an awful sound  
Funky Claude was running in and out  
Pulling kids out the ground  
When it all was over  
We had to find another place  
But Swiss time was running out  
It seemed that we would lose the race  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky  
  
We ended up at the grand hotel  
It was empty cold and bare  
But with the Rolling truck Stones thing just outside  
Making our music there  
With a few red lights and a few old beds  
We make a place to sweat  
No matter what we get out of this  
I know we'll never forget  
Smoke on the water, fire in the sky

Remind me to tell you  
Bout the old silver miner  
Name of hard rock Pete  
Had his house built on a slope  
They say one of his legs  
Lived in Calico  
There's a rumor going round  
That the other lived in hope  
So I walked in the room  
And I stopped  
I turned around  
And looked over my shoulder  
And a voice close beside me said  
You'd better watch your head  
The party's over  
  
It wasn't long before  
The waitress came over and said  
Can I freshen up your drink  
And have you heard of these boys  
And if you feel included  
To buy some cowboy boots  
Well it's not that bad  
We can talk above the noise'  
So I sucked on my beer  
Shut my eyes  
And tried to listen to the words  
I know I missed the meaning  
But the message  
Was something I'd already heard  
  
Johnny Ringo's voice  
Is getting deeper  
And now he's going to put  
Another lock on the door  
The night is getting later  
My head is getting lighter  
The mood is getting darker  
Tequila's being poured  
So I smile  
At the old gunslinger  
In his frame on the wall  
As he pushed back his hat  
And it's all coming back  
I'd cut a long story short  
But it's much too late for that  
  
Somebody stole my guitar  
They took it from  
The back seat of my car  
  
I was sleeping in Memphis  
In my hotel room  
And somebody stole my guitar

While you were out  
The message says  
You left a number  
And I tried to call  
But they wrote it down  
In a perfect Spanish scrawl  
In a perfect Spanish scrawl  
  
Yet again  
I'm missing you  
King size bed  
(in a) hotel someplace  
I hear your name  
I see your face  
I see your face  
  
(The) back street dolls  
And the side door johnnies  
The wide eyed boys with their bags full of  
Money  
Back in the alley  
Going bang to the wall  
Tied to the tail  
Of a midnight crawl  
Heaven wouldn't be  
So high I know  
If the times gone by  
Hadn't been so low  
The best laid plans  
Come apart at the seams  
And shatter all my dreams  
  
Sometimes I feel like  
Screaming  
Close my eyes  
It's times like this  
My head goes down  
And the only thing I know  
Is the name of this town  
Is the name of this town  
  
Yet again  
I'm missing you  
Won't be long  
O' coming home  
Until that distant time  
I'll be moving on  
I'll be moving on

Sometimes I sit and wonder  
Sometimes I just sit  
I hope you all know  
What you're doing  
Anyway  
Who is driving this thing  
  
Did you know  
The warriors of the flat earth  
Have become the tyrants of the globe  
It's 'round about that time again  
She cried  
It's all for one my friends'  
  
All my dreams are soon forgotten  
When you leave me on the shelf  
I can think of nothing better  
Than to sit here by myself  
  
Least remembered  
Soon forgotten  
Didn't matter anyway  
How can I ever miss you  
If you never go away  
  
I'm amazed by the way  
How are you?  
I'm amazed how could you  
It wasn't that good to start with  
Anyway  
Nothings quite that simple  
  
Did you know  
The warriors of the flat earth  
Have become the tyrants of the globe  
It's 'round about that time again  
She cried  
It's all for one my friends  
  
Least remembered  
Soon forgotten  
Didn't matter anyway  
How can I ever miss you  
If you never go away  
  
Sometimes I sit and wonder  
Sometimes I just sit  
I hope you all know  
What you're doing  
Anyway  
Who is driving this thing  
  
Least remembered  
Soon forgotten  
Didn't matter anyway  
How can I ever miss you  
If you never go away

We had a lot of luck on Venus  
We always had a ball on Mars  
Meeting all the groovey people  
We've rocked the Milky Way so far  
We danced around with Borealice  
We're space truckin' round the the stars  
Come on let's go Space Truckin'  
  
Remember when we did the moonshot  
And Pony Trekker led the way  
We'd move to the Canaveral moonstop  
And everynaut would dance and sway  
We got music in our solar system  
We're space truckin' round the stars  
Come on let's go Space Truckin'  
  
The fireball that we rode was moving  
But now we've got a new machine  
Yeah Yeah Yeah Yeah the freaks said  
Man those cats can really swing  
They got music in their solar system  
They've rocked around the Milky Way  
They dance around the Borealice  
They're Space Truckin' everyday  
Come on  

Good golly, said little miss molly  
When she was rockin' in the house of blue light  
Tutti frutti was oh so rooty  
When she was rockin' to the east and west  
Lucille was oh so real  
When she didn't do her daddies will  
Come on baby, drive me crazy, do it, do it  
  
I'm a speed king you go to hear me sing  
I'm a speed king see me fly  
  
Saturday night and I just got paid  
Gonna fool about ain't gonna save  
Some people gonna rock some people gonna roll  
Gonna have a party to save my soul  
Hard headed woman and a soft hearted man  
They been causing trouble since it all began  
Take a little rice take a little beans  
Gonna rock and roll down to New Orleans

I was a young man when I died  
I was a flash, I was full of pride  
I gave it all, I gave my soul, I was so strong  
I felt the truth, I felt the pain in every song  
  
How well you know me  
You've seen me cry  
I'm just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky  
  
I was living in a rock and roll sky  
I was a king, heavy on the style  
Super trouper, yes I know you well, making me shine  
I couldn't see what you did to me.  
I was so blind  
  
How well you know me  
You've seen me cry  
I'm just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky  
  
I wanna be like I was before  
But this time I'm gonna know the score  
I need a home I can leave behind knowing you're there  
Super trouper, I can see you now, return your stare  
  
How well you know me  
You've seen me cry  
I'm just a shadow  
In a rock and roll sky

Riding on the moonpath  
In the silver of the night  
The fragrance on the air  
Was of another time  
I cried in all my innocence  
You were dressed in white  
And even if I'd had the strength  
I couldn't move to save my life  
  
The fear and the thrill  
Of the beast at the window  
The shivers and the chills  
On the hottest of nights  
He walked right through  
My open door  
As I began to run, he threw  
Some gold upon the floor, and said  
There's plenty more  
Where that came from  
  
I'm tired of the bombs  
I'm tired of the bullets  
I'm tired of the crazies on TV  
I'm the aviator  
A dream's a dream whatever it seems  
  
I flew along the lighted street  
I flew above the town  
I flew in ever rising circles  
Ever further from the ground  
As I begin to lose my breath  
Printed faxes turn a spin  
A distant corner of the room  
Will open up and let me in  
  
I'm tired of the news  
I'm tired of the weather  
I'm tired of the same thing every day  
I'm the aviator  
A dream's a dream whatever they say

There's a full time reservation  
Made in a bar at the railway station.  
And there's a story, a kind of fable,  
On a card at the corner table.  
On it is a message, been there some time.  
It starts off, "The coffee tasted so fine"  
It says, "One day, this may find you,  
These few words may just remind you.  
We sat here together just to pass time,  
You said how the coffee tasted so fine. "  
It goes on to say, "I love you.  
If you should find this I must hear from you. "  
It gives a number but the name has faded away.  
All that is left are just the words, "Maybe someday"  
That's the story and the fable,  
Never leave alone from a corner table.  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo,  
Doo doo doo doo, doo doo doo doo, doo doo.

Got your finger on the trigger  
Your cold eyes taking aim  
You took a shot at my heart  
Let the bullets fly  
Tell me has one of them got my name?  
  
What about the heartache  
What about the emptiness inside  
It doesn't just fade away  
Turning the knife  
How much can I bleed  
The cut runs deep  
  
I can't find no salvation  
Can't find no healing touch  
Reaching out for mercy  
A stranger in your eyes  
I want you too much  
  
What about the heartache  
What about the emptiness inside  
It doesn't just fade away  
Turning the knife  
How much can I bleed  
The cut runs deep

Tell me gypsy can you see me  
In your crystal ball  
I'm asking you what can I do  
My back's against the wall  
And I can't hold on much longer  
So I've come to you my friend  
For now my life seems at an end  
  
I came to see you once before  
One hundred years ago  
You took my hand and broke the spell  
That should have let me go  
But my years have gone so slowly  
So I'm here again my friend  
For now my life is at an end

Listen to me...  
I've got a warning for you  
You've got to learn to take more care  
'Cause if you swim in dirty water  
  
Be careful how you dry your hair  
In a room within a room  
In a hole within a hole  
You've got to learn to share your secrets  
Or you'll lose your soul  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
It's so hard to hold back  
When the fire is in your eyes  
A silver dollar in my pocket  
I don't like surprises  
  
I've got your souvenir  
Is that the price I've got to pay?  
It ain't been that long  
Since the last charade  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...  
  
I know you're guilty  
But I'm carrying the blame  
I took out much more than I put in  
And I felt the pain  
In a dirty little room  
With nowhere left to hide  
You told the truth with your eyes  
But you lied inside  
  
I've got the evidence  
I know you broke  
The unwritten law  
Another town, another one night stand  
You know, you broke the law...

Don't get me started, let's get it right  
There's no use to talk about it deep into the night  
Don't ask about secrets I could tell  
I'm gonna keep them to myself  
  
No bad decisions, no good advice  
No time to think about it even once or twice  
No second chances looking down the road  
When there's the only way, only way to go  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
I can't remember, I can't forget  
Take it from me there's not a moment of regret  
Since the day I learned to tie my shoes  
I found it hard to spread the news  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
It's hard to swallow, it's hard to take  
When I think about it now my knees begin to shake  
Never came to me to mention at the time  
Tell the truth it never crossed my mind  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Well could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
Oh it makes me wonder  
What's going on inside my head  
Could it be the pressure that I'm under  
Makes me forget the things I never said  
  
  
(thanks to Jorge for this lyric)

The world around us hangs in doubt  
You face a crime that we'll hear about  
To pay the cost would never be the same  
Eternal lovers we're not to blame  
There's no mistake there's no refrain  
The same surroundings that stood  
Are here again - this time...  
  
As I look around you can't be found  
To lose you I'd rather see  
The endless time of space go passing by  
This time around...  
This time around...  
So look around we all will be found  
In love...  
  
The world around us hangs in doubt  
You face a crime that we'll hear about  
To pay the cost would never be the same  
Eternal lover you're not to blame  
There's no mistake there's no refrain  
The same surroundings that stood  
Are here again - this time...  
  
As I look around you can't be found,  
To lose you, I'd rather see  
The endless time of space go passing by  
This time around...  
This time around...  
To lose you I'd rather see  
The endless time of space go passing by  
Fly...  
By...

Consider your position position your defense  
Why don't you let me ask you is it mere coincidence  
Feeding speculators on a downhill gravy train  
Like vultures ripping out the eyes to reach the dying brain  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
And there's a time for peace a time for war  
Wondering what we've been put here for  
A time for giving a time to take  
A time for love and a time for hate  
A time for beg and a time to steal  
So you gamble on that spinning wheel  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill  
  
Ten percent of nothing is exactly what you got  
You thing you've got the given right to take another shot  
I'll take away your money all you've got is colored beads  
Find a piece of land where you can sow your seeds  
Listen to the wind - a silent scream  
Tearing at your broken heart  
Like a forgotten dream  
  
There's a time for passion a time for pain  
A time to learn that we're all the same  
A time to remember a time to forget  
Wondering how we're going to pay our debts  
A time for thunder a time for rain  
Waiting for the seasons to change  
Of all these things I've had my fill  
Lord I need some time to kill

You're so extreme, you're super heavy  
You're one step over the line  
Not what you seem, don't try and tell me  
I know what's really on your mind  
  
Once you get started you're out of control  
Don't play that sweet and innocent with me girl  
I know you know you want to rock and roll  
But I got just what you need  
  
I, I want to feel your love  
Too much is not enough  
I, I want to feel your touch  
Too much is not enough  
  
You've got it bad, you're hopelessly addicted  
You're always searching for the cure  
Love is the crime, you stand convicted  
You keep on coming back for more  
  
Come on admit it, you're over the top  
That song and dance won't work with me girl  
You just can't quit it, don't know when to stop  
But I got the remedy  
  
I, I want to feel your love  
Too much is not enough  
I, I want to feel your touch  
Too much is not enough  
  
Baby stop wasting time  
And let me know that you're mine  
I need to feel your embrace  
How much can I take

You know my will is broken  
You've got my heart on hold  
I'm lying here in pieces, so cold  
  
It gets so hard to handle  
All the things you need to say  
But I guess I heard it all before anyway  
Is love such a blessing or a curse  
Either way  
Truth hurts  
  
Well there'll be no more running  
Now I've got you face to face  
I want to know who you've been loving in my place  
  
You say I had it coming  
Try to hold my head up high  
Love gave me wings and left me paralyzed  
  
There's nothing left alive  
As we watch the spirits die  
The world keeps turning  
My heart keeps learning  
Do you know where the guilty sleep  
  
Babe I've got my pride  
Somehow I will survive  
The world keeps turning  
My heart keeps learning  
Do you know where the lonely sleep tonight  
  
Another fallen angel  
How far I just can't tell  
Living without love is a living hell  
Why is love such a blessing or a curse  
Baby either way  
Truth hurts  
  
Babe I've got my pride  
Somehow I will survive  
My heart keeps learning  
Don't know which is worse  
But one thing that I know  
  
Truth hurts

Infidel can you hear  
Would-be strange delight  
I need you to give your sympathy tonight  
When you hear what I say  
Deeds I've done  
Realize I've never lost and never won  
  
I've got a feeling that it's never right  
There was a reason but it's out of sight  
It's going down somewhere tonight  
Under the gun  
  
Put death in my hand  
Learn to fight  
Who could care if it's wrong or if it's right  
We got no choice  
Under command  
We're ordered to die or take this land  
  
Stupid bastards and religious freaks  
So safe in their castle keeps  
They turn away as a mother weeps  
Under the gun  
  
When brave men fall  
Under crimson skies  
There's a sadness reflected in a soldier's eyes  
Tears will dry  
For those I kill  
Remember no more their names but someone will  
  
The only way to be victorious  
Screw the fools who think it's glorious  
Who gives a toss about the likes of us?  
Under the gun

Playing pool and drinking beer  
Nothin' more'n the  
Occasional tear  
But this man's life goes on  
And he gets  
Greased all over  
From time to time  
At the strip joint, where we met  
He said 'Hi, my name is Ted  
See that one over there  
That ball of thunder  
Every time she goes Vavoom,  
I wiggle in my chair  
Can I buy you a beer?  
What a guy  
  
I've had a few myself he said  
But I never quit when I'm ahead  
Too many rules and regulations  
Stupid laws designed by fools behind closed doors  
And another thing I won't discuss is religion  
It always causes a fight  
Vavoom  
There she goes again  
'How does she do that' said Ted  
  
And he told me  
Of those unjustices (that)  
He had suffered in his life  
His wife and kids  
And boss and dogs  
And neighbors  
Raising cain and causing strife  
They were forever whining  
Bleating howling yapping screeching moaning crying  
Vavoom  
He fed them well  
He keep them warm  
  
Thing about Ted  
He didn't really care  
Nothing much got in his hair  
And the beauty of it was  
That he was right  
He was big as a truck  
And fast as a door  
(what's that?)  
He was always right  
  
The banjo player took a hike  
What's that song  
I used to like  
Vavoom  
He was big as a truck  
Fast as a door - Ted  
Ted the man our Ted

Wait before you go,  
So you will know, what I am feeling as you leave  
I understand, your need for some time  
Some solitude  
  
Wait a while, before you go  
You should know by now, my heart belongs to you  
  
I know that you must leave  
And I can see, that it's not easy for you, now that I'll be here, I know that
my soul  
Is always near you  
  
Wait a while before you go  
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while For you  
  
The sand of time is slipping through my fingers  
You and I, still the memories linger on  
And on  
  
Now I know that if I can only let go  
And wait a while, you'll be here again with me  
The same old friends we've always been  
  
Wait a while before you go  
You should know by now I love you and so I will wait a while  
Wait a while  
Wait a while  
For you

If you don't like what you see  
If you can do better than me  
Walk on  
  
If the road before you winds  
Obscuring all the signs  
Walk on  
  
You mean more to me  
Than just a pretty face  
I won't hold you down  
You need a little space  
  
If you don't like what you see  
If you can do better than me  
Walk on  
  
You know I don't like to fight  
No matter who's wrong or right  
Walk on

The day is gone  
When the angels come to stay  
And all the silent whispers  
Will be blown away  
And lying in the corner  
A pair of high heel shoes  
Hanging on the wall  
Gold and silver for the blues  
  
One too many wasted sunsets  
One too many for the road  
And after dark the door is always open  
Hoping someone else will show  
  
Someone is waiting behind  
An unlocked door  
Grey circles overhead empties  
On the floor  
The cracks in the walls have  
Grown too long  
The slow hand is dragging on  
Afraid to meet the dawn  
  
One too many wasted sunsets  
One too many for the road  
And after dark the door is always open  
Hoping someone else will show

I sit here alone  
I sit here alone  
I look at the walls  
Look at the walls  
Look at the walls  
I look at the walls  
  
You shouldn't be out on your  
Own oh no not with  
A condition like that  
Oh no sir constant care  
A condition like that  
A condition so rare a penny  
For the guy a penny for your  
Thoughts one a penny  
Two a penny penny in  
Your pocket ding dong bell, who  
Can tell Wild Man Fisher  
Got nothing on me  
  
I sit by the water  
I sit by the water  
Watch it go by  
Clouds going by  
I'm watching the sky  
  
I left my luggage at the station  
Didn't know how to  
Say goodbye  
I walked away from all the fury  
And the madness and the fury  
And the madness and the fury  
And the madness  
  
I smile to myself  
I smile to myself  
  
You're on the blind side I'm on  
The other side now I'm on the  
Outside looking for another side  
Upside down side I'm still lucid I  
May be crazy but I'm not stupid  
Try to get out the parking lot's  
Full no matter no matter what's  
A man going to do one two  
Buckle my shoe zip my lip

Try to see it my way  
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go wrong  
While you see it your way  
Run the risk of knowing that our love will soon be gone  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Think of what you're saying  
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright  
Think of what I'm saying  
We can work it out and get it straight or say goodnight  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Life is very short and there's no time  
For fussing and fighting my friend  
I have always thought that it's a crime  
So I will ask you once again  
I'll ask you once again  
  
Try to see it my way  
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong  
While I see it your way  
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
Life is very short and there's no time  
For fussing and fighting my friend  
I have always thought that it's a crime  
So I will ask you once again  
I'll ask you once again  
  
Try to see it my way  
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong  
While I see it your way  
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long  
  
We can work it out  
We can work it out  
  
At least we can try  
We can try out to work it out someday

Roll me over slowly, I've been drinkin' all night,  
Help me make a move, I can't stand the light.  
Wake me, shake me, don't slam the door.  
I ain't been so bad, I just can't recall.  
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame,  
Lyin' on the floor I can't remember her name.  
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here.  
What's goin onhere?  
  
Went downtown, had a long way to go.  
How I got there, well, I don't know.  
Found myself sittin' in a west side bar,  
Tried to leave but I could not go far.  
High class woman try'n to give me a line,  
Should have left early when I felt so fine.  
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here.  
What's goin' on here?  
  
When they closed up the bar, you know, they left me for dead.  
I can't remember a thing I said.  
Must have called the police to take me away.  
They said, "Forty days", now I've got to pay.  
Spent the night chasin' up a listed old flame,  
Lyin' on the floor I can't remember my name.  
I can't get together while they're messin' with me,  
Keep on lookin' round, tell me where can I be.  
I can't stay here, there's something wrong here.  
What's goin' on here?

Unforgettable face  
I can't think of her name  
It's on the edge of my tongue  
Gathering dust in the  
Back of my brain  
Something 'bout the way  
She ignores me  
That's vaguely familiar  
Makes you wonder what it was  
You ever did to thrill her  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
I never felt the need to soothe  
Her savage breast  
She never felt obliged to tell me  
Of her change of address  
Caught me on a downward swing  
But I fell through her arms  
How could I be so careless  
I never meant to go so far  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
Oh she's back in town  
Oh she's back in town  
I'm not leaving I'm running away  
  
She took it all away  
Now she's back for the rest  
Took it all so easy  
Wouldn't settle for less  
She doesn't know what  
She wants  
But she knows how to get it  
I can't remember the time  
She never let me forget it  
  
Here we go again  
Here we go again  
Here I go again  
  
Oh Whatsername's back in town  
She's back in town  
I'm not leaving I'm running away  
Oh she's back in town  
Oh she's back in town  
I'm not leaving I'm running away

If you're leaving close the door.  
I'm not expecting people anymore.  
Hear me grieving, I'm lying on the floor.  
Whether I'm drunk or dead I really ain't too sure.  
  
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man and my world is pale.  
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know there ain't no sadder tale.  
  
Had a friend once in a room,  
had a good time but it ended much too soon.  
In a cold month in that room  
we found a reason for the things we had to do.  
  
I'm a blind man, I'm a blind man, now my room is cold.  
When a blind man cries, Lord, you know he feels it from his soul.

There's a black hill  
We had a climb  
Everything I need but nothing's mine  
Satan's world, I've had a kill  
Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill?  
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill  
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will  
  
I'm losing time and my mind  
Why can't I ever have what's naturally mine?  
I got life and the things that go with it  
If there's something else, where can i get it?  
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill  
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will  
  
Well here's my views, I always lose  
Things I want to do are yesterday's news  
Say life's a ball, I've had it all  
Out there in another dance hall  
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill  
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will  
  
Take me as I am, an excuse for a man  
Wherever I push someone stops my hand  
As a matter of interest, tell me if you will  
Why didn't Rosemary ever take the pill?  
Lying there waiting, waiting for the kill  
Oh man won't do it, but the devil will  
  
Oh, why won't Rosemary ever take the pill?

Fly into the rising sun,  
Faces, smiling everyone  
Yeah, she is a whole new tradition  
I feel it in my heart  
  
My woman from Tokyo  
She makes me see  
My woman from Tokyo  
She's so good to me  
  
Talk about her like a Queen  
Dancing in a Eastern Dream  
Yeah, she makes me feel like a river  
That carries me away  
  
My woman from Tokyo  
She makes me see  
My woman from Tokyo  
She's so good to me  
  
But I'm at home and I just don't belong  
  
So far away from the garden we love  
She is what moves in the soul of a dove  
Soon I shall see just how black was my night  
When we're alone in Her City of light  
  
Rising from the neon gloom  
Shining like a crazy moon  
Yeah, she turns me on like a fire  
I get high  
  
My woman from Tokyo  
She makes me see  
My woman from Tokyo  
She's so good to me  

I wasn't in the room when the action was going down  
I may have been there once but at the time I was out of town  
I'm seeing strange fruit, they're saving off with his head  
One way or another I'll end up dead  
  
You got the wrong man  
You don't understand  
You got the wrong man  
You got the wrong man  
I do what I can  
  
I plead not guilty to the charges you've laid out on your desk  
l know what you're thinking 'Oh yes, this is a DSF  
I think I'm prime ministerial material but I can't lie to you  
So I'm out of the running  
But from here in my cell I imagine  
Wouldn't that be something  
  
You got the wrong man  
You don't understand  
You got the wrong man  
You got the wrong man  
I do what I can

Have you ever thought of the feeling  
I get when I'm alone with you  
It's causing me worry and trouble  
I'm going 'round in circles  
Don't know what I'm gonna do  
  
You can't do it right  
With the one you love  
Nothing you can do  
Without the one you love  
  
You were always playing my records  
When I was after making some love  
But I need more than the music  
To keep myself together  
Although it makes me feel so good  
  
You can't do it right  
With the one you love  
Nothing you can do  
Without the one you love  
  
Sometimes in the morning  
I wake up without you  
Can't get up, it's getting me down  
Tell me what you're trying to do  
Later in the evening  
You come home feeling low  
If you'd stop your cruising  
Maybe we could make a show  
  
You can't do it right  
With the one you love  
Nothing you can do  
Without the one you love

You fool no one, waiting to see if I'm gone.  
So hard to see you are taking your chances with me.  
If I find you with some other man  
You know what I'm gonna do.  
Better run if you see me comin', ah.  
  
Soon you will fall, making mistakes like before.  
When you tell me lies I can see by the look in your eyes.  
If you think you're gonna take me for granted,  
Chasin' round with all you see,  
Gonna make you live to regret it, ah.  
  
You fool no one, waiting to see if I'm gone.  
So clear to see you've had all your chances with me.  
You thought that you could take me for granted  
But I couldn't take it no more.  
Better run when you see me comin, ah.
