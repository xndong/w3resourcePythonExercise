Livin' with my eyes closed, goin' day to day  
I never knew the difference, I never cared either way  
Lookin' for a reason, searchin' for a sign  
Reachin' out with both hands, I gotta feel the kick inside  
All fired up  
Now I believe there comes a time  
All fired up  
When everything just falls in line  
All fired up  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
All fired up, fired up, fired up, hey  
  
Ain't nobody livin', in a perfect world  
Everybody's out there, cryin' to be heard  
Now I got a new fire, burnin' in my eyes  
Lightin' up the darkness, movin' like a meteorite  
  
[Chorus:]  
All fired up  
Now I believe there comes a time  
All fired up  
When everything just falls in line  
All fired up  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
All fired up, fired up, fired up  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe there comes a time  
When everything just falls in line  
We live an' learn from our mistakes  
The deepest cuts are healed by faith  
Now I believe  
  
[Chorus]

I walk around pretending you were never here  
But the smell of you is everywhere  
I ache so bad for you I want to shed my skin  
Try and keep my thoughts from turning into you  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I'm not angry anymore  
  
There is no wound as deep as a lovers betrayal  
No touch as tender as your lover's hand  
You were so generous with both I nearly died  
Took all my dignity 'til there was nothin' left inside  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I'm not angry anymore  
  
I just want to forget you  
Erase you, replace you with  
Forgiveness, forgiveness  
  
I ache so bad for you I want to shed my skin  
Try and keep my thoughts from turning into you  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I just want to forget you  
Erase you, replace you with  
Forgiveness, forgiveness  
  
I'm not angry anymore  
I'm not angry  
I'm not angry anymore

Get Nervous... Get Nervous

Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
Get Nervous... Get Nervous  
I feel a little shaky, I can't control my nerves  
I know you think I'm fakin', but can't you feel the curves?  
I swear to you I feel it, it scares me half to death  
It gathers in my throat and it gathers up my breath  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run  
Anxiety - Yeah, I just need someone  
Anxiety - Can't get nothin' done  
Anxiety - Spoils all the fun  
  
I'm picking up the telephone, there's no one I can call  
I need somebody bad tonight, can't find no sleep at all  
I wish I could relax, I just can't stop my mind  
I wish I could collapse but my body's not that kind  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run  
Anxiety - Yeah, I just need someone  
Anxiety - Can't get nothin' done  
Anxiety - Spoils all the fun  
  
Can't you hear my heartbeat, hear the way it sounds?  
Can't you hear my heartbeat, Y' hear the way it pounds?  
Just give me somethin' to slow it down, Yeah  
  
Sometimes in the city, sometimes in my car  
I pound on the windows like a bee inside a jar  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run  
Anxiety - Yeah, I just need someone  
Anxiety - Can't get nothin' done  
Anxiety - Spoils all the fun  
  
Anxiety - Got me on the run

People like to shake you up and put you down  
Run you all around, drive you crazy  
Like to steal the roses right out of your bed  
Get inside your head, drive you crazy  
Never really knew what love could be, yeh  
Never really thought about you and me, yeh  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
  
Everybody tells you how you ought to be  
What they think they see, they can't teach you, no  
Big world on your shoulder, it don't mean a thing  
If that song they sing, hey - don't reach you  
Never really knew what love could be, yeh  
Only want to think about you and me, yeh  
  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy, Crazy  
Hey Baby, Baby, oh, oh, oh  
  
Crazy, Crazy, Crazy  
Crazy - I really want to go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Feel like I'm gonna go crazy  
Crazy - feel like I'm gonna go crazy

I was alright, for a while  
I could smile for a while  
But when I saw you last night  
You held my hand so tight  
As you stopped to say hello  
Oh, you wished me well  
And you couldn't tell  
That i'd been  
  
Crying over you  
Crying over you  
  
When you said so long  
You left me standing all alone  
Alone and crying  
  
Crying  
Crying  
I'm crying  
It's hard to understand  
That the touch of your hand  
Could start me crying  
  
I thought that I was over you  
But it's true, oh so true  
I love you even more  
Than I did before  
But darling, what can I do  
'cause you don't love me  
And I'll always be  
  
Crying over you  
Crying over you  
  
And now that you're gone  
And from this moment on  
I'll be crying  
Crying  
Crying  
Crying  
I'm crying  
I'm crying  
Over you

From the top of the hill  
You can see all the lights of the Diamond Field  
The treasure buried in plain sight  
Where one mans loss is another mans gain  
And no one cares about anything, worth caring about  
  
Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight  
Tightrope walkin', in the web of light  
Shall we go the Diamond Field and try  
To seek the fortune in their eyes  
  
One by one the lights go out  
And the Diamond Field begins to fade  
  
It turns back into cement and stone  
Brick and asphalt, flesh and bone  
  
Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight  
Tightrope walkin', in the web of light  
Shall we go the Diamond Field and try  
To seek the fortune in their eyes  
  
Shall we go to the Diamond Field tonight  
Tightrope walkin', in the web of light  
Electric angles move against the night  
Shining in the Diamond Field

It seems I loved you for so long  
It seems like all of my life  
Just like a child who doesn't belong  
You'd turn, 'til even the sun became your shadow  
And I hate you in your innocence, you know  
But I hate myself even more for lovin' you so  
  
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go  
  
Nobody's perfect, certainly not us  
We've all got secrets to keep  
I would have kept yours safe in my heart  
You would have always known where to find me  
And I know you better that I know myself, you know  
So why pretend you've got somewhere else to go  
  
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go  
  
Sometimes it hurt so bad that you cry  
Then there's the times you wish you had died  
Sometimes the truth is worse than the lie, sometimes  
Sometimes it's best to lock it away  
In a place that's secret and safe  
Sometimes you just pretend you don't know  
Sometimes it's best to let go  
  
Sometimes I believed, what you had to say  
Then I watched you bleed, all the truth away  
Somewhere in my heart, there's a place I know  
Where all our dirty little secrets go

Well there used to be a time when a man was a king  
To work for a man was a woman's only dream  
Everything he did was perfectly alright  
He didn't have to worry about fussin' and fightin'  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
  
There used to be a time when a woman couldn't smoke  
There used to be a time when a woman couldn't vote  
She used to stay at home while the man went out to play  
She was satisfied with life any old way  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
Well, well  
  
There used to be a time when a woman couldn't cook  
There used to be a time she didn't worry about her looks  
She used to sip on sassafrass, she didn't even drink  
She didn't try to tell her man how to think  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed  
  
It don't happen no more  
That was a long time ago  
It's a pitiful shame  
How the world has changed

If it's getting harder to face everyday  
Don't let it show, don't let it show  
Though it's getting harder to take what they say  
Just let it go  
And if it hurts when they mention my name  
Say you don't know me  
And if it helps when they say I'm to blame  
Say you don't own me  
  
Even if it's taking the easy way out  
Keep it inside of you  
Don't give in  
Don't tell them anything  
  
Don't let it  
Don't let it show  
  
Even though you know it's the wrong thing to say  
Say you don't care, say you don't care  
Even if you want to believe there's a way  
I won't be there, I won't be there  
  
But if you smile when they mention my name  
They'll never know you  
And if you laugh when they say I'm to blame  
They'll never own you  
  
Even if you feel you've got nothing to hide  
Keep it inside of you  
Don't give in  
Don't tell them anything  
  
Don't let it  
Don't let it show

Standin' in the doorway, forgot to say one thing  
You've always had the power to lift my wings  
I know I shouldn't need so much, an' we could say goodbye  
Oh yes I am a dreamer, I still see us flyin' high  
  
We can start over, darlin' it's clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
  
Somethin' brings us together, keeps tearin' us apart  
The wounded are much wiser, we'll just take it from the start  
  
We can start over, darlin' it's clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
  
We can start over, darlin' it's clear  
Love is what brought you here  
  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
Don't Walk Away  
Don't Walk Away!  
  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Don't Walk Away, victory's hollow  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, you won't be alone  
Don't Walk Away  
Oh, to see if I follow  
Oh, Don't Walk Away, Don't Walk Away  
Been that road, it didn't take us home  
Turn around, turn around, you won't be, you won't be alone

Everybody go round, go round, go round  
Everybody lay down, lay down, lay down  
Don't nobody make a sound  
Everybody lay down  
Everybody give up, give up, give up  
Nobody hang tough, hang tough, hang tough  
Life a little too rough  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody say hey, Don't nobody say no?  
Everybody say wait, Don't nobody say go? (CHORUS)  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody cry loud, cry loud, cry loud  
Nobody too proud, too proud, too proud  
To tell you what they're all about  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody don't care, don't care, don't care  
Nobody play fair, play fair, play fair  
Maybe everybody too scared  
Everybody lay down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody lookin' higher  
Everybody want to touch the fire  
Nobody willing to lay it all down  
  
Everybody want heaven  
Everybody say Amen  
One thing is certain, you gotta lay it all down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody go round, go round, go  
Everybody lay down, lay down  
Don't nobody make a sound  
Everybody lay down  
  
Everybody give up, give up, give up  
Nobody hang tough, hang tough  
When it's just a little rough, everybody lay down  
  
[Chorus: x2]

They were so ecstatic when the letter arrived  
A certified genius at the age of five  
They planned his future so carefully  
He was everything they hoped he'd be  
He was a model child, a devoted son  
Loved and admired by everyone  
He played out every role, a "T.V. hero"  
He lived his life in a video fantasy  
  
He was good at school, never failed a grade  
They gave him hopes and dreams, and taught him not to hate  
He had rules he learned to break for fun  
Now he's hidin', 'cause his fingerprints on the gun  
  
Why'd ya' have to do it Evil Genius?  
Was it justified in your mind?  
Why'd ya' put us through it Evil Genius?  
Was it justified in your mind anytime you held a grudge?  
  
Was it something said that pushed you over the line?  
Your best interests were in our minds  
You kept it so well hidden, we never knew  
No one ever expected anything like this from you  
  
Why'd ya' have to do it Evil Genius?  
Was it justified in your mind?  
Why'd ya' put us through it Evil Genius?  
Was it justified in your mind anytime you held a grudge?  
  
Why'd ya' have to do it Evil Genius?  
Was it justified in your mind?  
Why'd ya' put us through it Evil Genius?  
Was it justified in your mind anytime you held a grudge?

I heard you say you're feelin' like a change now  
Maybe, baby this could be arranged now  
But I warn you that no exotic scenery  
Will solve your problems or make you feel easy  
You say you're happy, but I see apprehension  
That little laugh of yours doesn't hide the tension  
The precious book you clutch so tightly in your hands  
Won't help you sleep at night, won't iron out your plans  
  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
You got to do it for yourself  
You got to say when  
  
You ask advice, then resent my observations  
If I didn't care, then I wouldn't make them  
Can't change the past, so why let it haunt you  
Can paint the future, but first you have to want to  
  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
You got to do it for yourself  
You got to say when  
  
I can see how much you hurt inside  
I know all about the tears you hide  
  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
You gotta Fight It Out with your heart  
You got to Fight It, though it tears you apart  
You got to Fight It Out, my friend  
  
You know that the lonely pay a price for love in the end  
You know that the lonely pay a price for love in the end  
It's always the lonely who pay a price for love in the end

Do you like the way it feels when you get hurt?  
Maybe you should take a long hard look at your self-worth  
There's an emptiness inside  
It started many years ago  
You always try to fill it up  
It's a familiar place you go  
One day you'll just have to wake up, girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You know you got a lot to learn  
You've got to do it for yourself  
Find your own direction, don't rely on someone else  
You got to know it in your heart  
You've got to build it up with love, it isn't hard to rise above  
Wake up, you don't want to make up  
You've got to do it for yourself  
  
I know it feels sometimes that loneliness is worse  
And with every change there comes a melancholy search  
Now you can walk away from this  
It doesn't have to bring you down  
Have faith in destiny you what goes around, comes around  
You don't have to stay and take it, girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Got nowhere to run  
Got nowhere to hide  
These changes will come if you just open your eyes  
Got nowhere to run  
Got nowhere to hide  
  
You gotta do it for yourself  
You gotta know it in your heart  
It isn't hard to rise above

You say you'll always be there  
But I know you won't  
You say you love me, you swear  
But I know you don't  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go  
  
You say I got it all wrong  
That everything's changed  
But I know where I belong  
It's far, far away  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go  
  
Pick yourself up, get yourself moving  
Don't turn around, just keep on going  
There's nothing you can say  
To change my mind today  
There's only one thing left to do  
I guess you'll have to go  
You say you're a different man  
But you know that's a lie  
The truth is gonna set you  
Free and so am I  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go  
  
I got better things I can do ya know  
Than waste all of my time on you  
Why don't you just go

Yesterday's a by-line, words upon a page  
Tomorrow is a deadline, sudden and it's strange  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave, but you did  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave  
  
Nowhere to go, can't sit still  
Look for a motive in the time that I kill  
Thinking of ways  
To fill up my empty days, to fill up my empty days  
  
Hard To Believe  
you'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
  
Love is such a fine line, the finest line I've known  
But sorrow is no life line when you're all alone  
  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave, but you did  
Hard To Believe  
You ever would leave  
  
Can't sleep a wink, up all night  
The truth hurts, you know it cuts like a knife  
Thinking of ways  
To fill up my empty life, to fill up my empty life  
  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe  
Hard To Believe  
You'd leave when I need you  
I need you so, it's Hard To Believe

You think that you're the second coming  
Sorry to say it doesn't do it for me  
Must be a drag when you're so stunning  
In all that you are  
And all that you hope to be  
  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah  
  
You think that you can walk on water  
Better be careful, it gets mighty deep  
I'd be afraid of what my thoughts were  
You never know who'd be willing  
To take that leap  
  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah  
  
When you look in the mirror  
Do you see any clearer  
Or are you blinded  
By your own vision  
Or have you ever thought  
That maybe you were wrong  
Or do you just reside  
In your illusion  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah  
  
You can have it all, take it all  
Break it all, forsake it all  
Want it all, choose it all  
Use it with no stake at all  
Keep it all, trash it all  
Lead it just like sheep it all  
Hate it all, love it all, and still  
You'll have nothing  
Yeah, yeah

Your love is like a tidal wave, spinning over my head  
Drownin' me in your promises, better left unsaid  
You're the right kind of dreamer, to release my inner fantasy  
The invincible winner, and you know that you were born to be  
  
[Chorus]  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, a love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, a love taker  
Don't you mess around, no no no  
  
Your love has set my soul on fire, burnin' out of control  
You taught me the ways of desire, now it's takin' its toll  
You're the right kind of sinner, to release my inner fantasy  
The invincible winner, and you know that you were born to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, no  
  
You're the right kind of sinner, to release my inner fantasy  
The invincible winner, you know that you were born to be  
  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker  
Don't you mess around with me  
You're a heartbreaker  
Dream maker, love taker

Our two worlds met in strange surprise  
I hid my love in thin disguise  
I tried to leave, how could I stay?  
What if my heart gave me away?  
I always thought I'd be prepared  
But love just caught me unaware  
You said the words and I believed  
I fell so hard, I fell so deep  
  
Love can't hide, though it tries  
Hearts catch fire, so has mine  
Here's My Heart  
  
So true love triumphs once again  
It always makes it in the end  
And if you let the heart run free  
It will return faithfully  
  
Love can't hide, though it tries  
Hearts catch fire, all the time  
Helpless love walks the line  
Hearts catch fire, the hour is fine  
Here's My Heart  
  
Ooh, Ooh  
Love can't hide, though it tries  
Hearts catch fire, all the time  
Helpless love walks the line  
Hearts catch fire, so has mine  
  
Here's My Heart  
Here's My Heart  
Here's My Heart  
Here's My Heart  
  
Ooh... Hey, Hey, Hey

Danger in the shape of somethin'  
Wild  
Stranger dressed in black, she's a  
Hungry child  
No one knows who she is or what  
Her name is  
I don't know where she came from  
Or what her game is  
  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)  
(Hot child in the city)  
  
So young to be loose and on her  
Own  
Young boys, they all want to take  
Her home  
She goes downtown, the boys all  
Stop and stare  
When she goes downtown, she walks  
Like she just don't care, care  
  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)  
Yeah  
(Hot child in the city)  
  
Come on down to my place, baby  
We'll talk about love  
Come on down to my place, woman  
We'll make love!  
  
Hot child in the city  
(Hot child in the city)  
She's kinda dangerous  
(Hot child in the city)  
Young child  
(Runnin' wild and lookin' pretty)  
Young child, runnin' wild  
(Hot child in the city)  
Hot child in the city  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Hot child in the city)  
(Hot child in the city)  
Hot child in the city  
(Hot child in the city)  
Hot child in the city  
(Hot child in the city)

Did you see me last night  
I was there in the dark  
I saw her look at you, the way I used to  
When I still had your heart.  
  
I watched you take her hand  
There was love in your eyes  
I remember when you looked at me that way too  
Before we said good-bye  
  
I don't want to be your friend  
I just want to be your lover  
I don't think I can pretend  
That you mean nothing to me  
  
It's hard enough to say good-bye  
Even when you know it's over  
I don't want to be your friend  
I want to be your lover and when I think I've had enough  
And I just can't stand the pain  
I reminisce about the way it felt  
To have you every day  
You know that every time I hear your voice  
I still get a thrill  
And there's nothing I can do about it  
  
Am I gone from your thoughts, forgotten somehow  
When you be there with her  
Does my memory stir, any part of you now  
I know that I should concede, face the truth and all that  
I know I should realize I'm not a part of your life anymore,  
But I can't  
  
I don't want to be your friend  
I just want to be your lover  
I don't think I can pretend  
That you mean nothing to me  
  
It's hard enough to say good-bye  
Even when you know it's over  
I don't want to be your friend  
I want to be your lover

Well maybe just lucky enough  
Till you win your love for me

Alright

In the heat of the night, when you know it ain't right  
But you do what you want to do  
You do what you feel, no one can feel like you  
Out in the summertime city, ain't it a pity  
There's so much to tie you down  
You're leaving tonight to somewhere you can't be found  
While down at the edge of town  
At a pool hall where they all hang around  
You hear them talkin' about the girls they knew  
And talk about what they're gonna do  
Then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?  
Is it right, or is it wrong?  
Does it matter what's right, in the heat of the night?  
  
Out in the streets tonight, under the neon lights  
You're searchin' for something new  
But nothin' is real, and no one can feel like you  
They say that eagles fly in this red hot sky  
But were they just passin' through  
Or did they look down, and see what you found was true  
  
But still in the back of your mind  
You've got somethin' to believe in, but there's so much to find  
As the bright lights dim, and the night closes in  
You thought everything is ending, but it's yet to begin  
And you ain't seen nothing yet!  
But what you see you'll never forget, and you'll say  
  
Why oh why)  
Did it take you so long to want something more?  
Why oh why)  
Did you never get off on this before?  
Why oh why)  
Well, here it is, the love you've been waitin' for  
Why oh why)  
Standin' in front of you like an open door  
  
And then you ask yourself, is this where you belong?  
Is it right, or is it wrong?  
Does it matter what's right, in the heat of the night?  
  
In the heat of the night, when you know it ain't right  
But you do what you want to do  
You do what you feel, 'cause no one can feel like you

This bloody road remains a mystery  
This sudden darkness fills the air  
What are we waiting for?  
Won't anybody help us?  
What are we waiting for?  
  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
This shattered dream you cannot justify  
We're gonna scream until we're satisfied  
What are we running for?  
We've got the right to be angry  
What are we running for?  
When there's no where we can run to anymore  
  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
And with the power of conviction  
There is no sacrifice  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
Won't anybody help us?  
What are we running for?  
When there's no where, no where we can run to anymore  
  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
And with the power of conviction  
There is no sacrifice  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible  
  
Yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah  
  
[Repeat: x2]  
We can't afford to be innocent  
Stand up and face the enemy  
It's a do or die situation  
We will be invincible

Isn't it a tuff life?  
You race your Mercedes through the park after midnight  
Hopin' for a few cheap thrills  
There's always someone around to lift your spirits up  
All along just pumpin' up your attitude  
Don't believe a word they say  
Cause it's never true  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
If you can't have it, then you don't want it  
You don't need no steady job  
Well, isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
  
You thought you'd move to Jamaica  
So you packed up your bags and headed south to get an even tan  
But, you didn't count on rain  
  
You were "perfect" for the script  
So you bought the best selling novel  
Knowing that you couldn't miss  
But you never got the part  
  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
If you can't have it, then you don't want it  
You don't need no steady job  
Well, isn't it a tuff life?  
  
It don't get any easier  
And you know, sometimes it can get pretty ruff  
  
Well, isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You've got such a tuff life  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got a tuff life  
Isn't it a tuff life?  
You got such a tuff life)

I ain't gonna let you have your way  
  
I've got papers on you baby  
And I mean in black and white  
I've got papers on you  
And I mean in black and white  
  
Now I ain't hard to get along with  
But you just gotta treat me right

It's Just Like Me, to say to you  
Love me dear, an' I'll be true  
And all I want for you to say  
Is you'll come home with me each day  
You could be my love  
That's what I want  
Just you, secure and safe from harm  
It's Just Like Me, to feel so good  
And fall so much, in love with you

Love me dear, an' I'll be true  
And all I want for you to say  
Is you'll come home with me each day

There comes a time  
When you should see things clear  
Free from my innocence  
There is no circumstance too severe  
Only the need for us, for us to believe again  
  
There is a time, temptation's on the run  
Dreamer, you've had your way  
Soldier, you've had your day in the sun  
Now it's time, oh, it's time for us to begin again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
There comes a time  
When you must find your way  
Beggar has made his bed  
Wrapped in a silhouette of gold and gray  
Now it's time, yes it's time for us to believe again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Standing so close to me, the possibility  
To change our destiny  
I see it perfectly, moving so naturally  
Nothing can stand in our way  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again  
  
Le bel age  
Only our love will remain  
Le bel age  
Close to the truth once again

You've gotta admit, you paint a pretty picture  
No one would ever suspect, your so adept at the art  
I hear the lonely lover sigh  
You hide behind cosmetic eyes  
Kiss them off with Lipstick Lies  
Lipstick Lies won't hide the truth  
They won't keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
You're the Picasso of pain, a fantasy in fleshtone  
And though you're never the same  
You're never far from the mark  
Now and then you close your eyes  
To see the heartbreak in disguise  
Kiss them off with Lipstick Lies  
Lipstick Lies won't hide the truth  
They won't keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
You see just what you want to see  
Who's to blame?  
Love is love by any name  
Who's to blame?  
Lipstick Lies won't hide the truth  
They won't keep you waterproof  
The victim of your vanity  
You see just what you want to see  
Who's to blame?  
Love is love by any name  
Who's to blame?  
Love is love by any name  
Who's to blame?  
Love is love by any name  
Who's to blame?

I hear you had a good offer down on Third Avenue  
You tell me that was the reason  
For whatcha' put me through, yeah  
And now you come collapsin' back  
I feel the heat of your attack  
Want me to take you back  
I'm givin' you the sack  
So don't waste your time  
  
[Chorus:]  
It's a little too little  
It's a little too late  
I'm a little too hurt  
And there's nothin' left that I've gotta say  
You can cry to me baby  
But there's only so much I can take  
Ah, it's a little too little  
It's a little too late  
  
You say you had a good time  
But did ya' think it was for free - yeah  
And how much did it get ya', all their flattery  
And now you come back, runnin' for protection  
You've been bitten by love and stung by rejection  
You can't connect  
What did you expect?  
I'm still gettin' over you  
  
[Chorus x4]

It's a cold world that we live in all the people say  
That this world is gettin' colder day by day  
Too little warmth left in our lives  
I don't know if what the people say is true  
But I noticed there's a change in you  
Too little warmth left in your eyes  
  
I am freezing, no love in this ice age  
Whoa, whoa  
I am freezing, there's no love in this ice age  
Whoa, whoa  
  
There is friction without fire when the passions spent  
As we shiver in the winter of our discontent  
So little love left in our lives  
  
Now we're standing in the shadows of a fading sun  
Words like weapons, the cold war touches everyone  
So little love left in our eyes  
  
I am freezing, no love in this ice age  
Whoa, whoa  
I am freezing, there's no love in this ice age  
Whoa, whoa  
  
Feeling the chill that comes with the pain  
Love in the ice age  
  
I am freezing, no love in this ice age  
Whoa, whoa  
I am freezing, there's no love in this ice age  
Whoa, whoa  
Whoa, whoa  
Whoa, whoa

You know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
She's out on her own, forever  
She's programmed to work hard, she's never profane  
She won't go insane, not ever  
No v.d., no cancer, on TV's the answer  
No father, no mother,, she's just like the other  
And you know and I know, my clone sleeps alone  
  
Your clone loves my clone, but yours cannot see  
That's no way to be, in heaven  
No sorrow, no heartache, just clone harmony  
So obviously, it's heaven  
  
No naughty clone ladies allowed in the eighties  
No bed names, no sex games, just clone names and clone games  
And you know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
  
Before we existed the cloning began  
The cloning of man and woman  
When we're gone they'll live on, cloned endlessly  
It's mandatory in heaven  
  
But they won't remember or ever be tender  
No loving, no caring, no program for pairing  
No v.d., no cancer, on Tv's the answer  
No father, no mother, she's just like the other  
  
No naughty clone ladies allowed in the eighties  
And you know and I know my clone sleeps alone  
My clone sleeps alone!  
My clone sleeps alone!

Never could say what I want to say  
Never could do what I want to do  
Never could believe you, if it's true  
Never could, never would, you make it so hard  
I never want to leave you  
I'm always right, you're never wrong  
We change the tune but not the song  
Over and over  
Till it's done, it's never done, never done  
You make it so hard  
Never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
  
Movin' together, comin' apart  
You're what I need, I'm what you want  
Never could refuse you from the start  
Never could, never would, never could  
You make it so hard  
  
Never could say what I want to say  
Never could do what I want to do  
Never could believe you, if it's true  
Never could, never would, you make it so hard  
  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
Never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to leave you  
I never want to

And the leaves of autumn will remain unchanged  
Falling though October skies that we brought again  
In time  
  
On winds that hint of winter  
Blowing through your life you will find no shelter  
Or is it answers tonight?  
  
Castles made of sand are built against the rain  
And their fragile walls will never claim you  
Hear the distant thunder calling out your name  
Crashing like the waves on New Dream Islands  
  
And you search for comfort in a land so fair  
Reachin' for those memories that are always there  
For you  
  
You can wear your sorrow like a veil of tears  
But it's just illusion that you hold so dear  
  
Castles made of sand are built against the rain  
And their fragile walls will never save you  
Hear the distant thunder calling out your name  
Crashing like the waves on New Dream Islands  
  
And the leaves of autumn will remain unchanged.

You keep tellin' me don't hang around  
While you play around with the clowns that you found  
It ain't right  
Now and then I get tired of the sound of you putting me down  
While you're playing the town every night  
I'm getting hung up, yes I am, yes I am  
And you don't give a damn  
  
[Chorus]  
No you don't  
Have to treat me like a fool  
No you don't  
Have to be so bloody cool  
No you don't  
Have to make up all the rules  
No you don't  
No, no you don't  
No you don't  
  
You keep playing your reckless games that will bring you fame  
But I'll take the blame for your name  
  
Well you think you've got my life in your hands  
But you don't understand, that I've got my own plans  
My own plans  
I'm going down, yes I am, yes I am  
And you don't give a damn  
  
[Chorus]

I hear your heartbeat but you're never there  
Like a mirage, you haunt me everywhere  
All day long  
I burn for you, lonely in the night  
I tried to live alone, but I just can't get it right  
Ya' know that, this town's like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat, movin' in the city  
I'm lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
  
I've done some thinkin', now that you're not here  
I know your reasons, and they're still not clear  
All I'm sure of is what I got to lose  
I tried to be a better loser, but it's just no use  
  
Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat, movin' in the city  
I'm lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
  
Walkin' in the sundown, I search in vain  
Waitin' on the wind that whispers out your name  
Through concrete canyons echoing a world of other faces  
No direction looks like home  
Where is my oasis?  
  
Ya' know that this town's like a Painted Desert  
Dead heat, movin' in the city  
I'm lost in a Painted Desert  
In a Painted Desert without you  
In a Painted Desert without you  
Where is my oasis?

I picked a rose this morning  
And it was so fresh, it looked like it was crying  
I thought how sad to be so beautiful  
Only to wither and die  
Like papa's roses soft and pale  
Like petals thrown in the dirt  
Only silence is spoken here  
All that grows here is hurt  
And papa's roses  
Papa wasn't really a hardened man  
He could be tender at times  
I remember, it was like it holiday  
When he was gentle and kind  
He gave those roses his heart and soul  
I wish he'd saved some for me  
It would've been such a simple thing,  
For me to be, like papa's roses  
Like papa's roses soft and pale  
Like petals thrown in the dirt  
Only silence is spoken here  
All that grows here is hurt  
And papa's roses  
Voices that whisper soft and low  
Forever buried inside  
Haunted by images dark and cold  
Forever burned in your mind  
But I dreamed I could fly away  
Like an angel I'd fly  
To the places where I could forget  
Forget that I was like papa's roses  
Like papa's roses soft and pale  
Like petals thrown in the dirt  
Only silence is spoken here  
All that grows here is hurt  
And papa's roses  

You act like you wanna listen when I'm talkin' to you  
You think you oughta do baby, anything you wanna do  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be, outta your mind  
As long as I'm payin' the bills  
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss  
  
I'll drink if I wanna, and play a little poker too  
I don't want to hear nothin' from ya  
As long as I'm takin' care of you  
As long as I'm workin' baby, payin' all the bills  
I don't want no mouth from you 'bout the way I'm supposed to live  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be, outta your mind  
As long as I'm footin' the bill  
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss  
  
Now that you got me huh, you act like you're ashamed  
You don't act like my man - you're just usin' my name  
I'm gonna have all the money baby  
I don't want no back talk  
You don't like how I'm doin'  
You can pick up your things and walk  
  
You must be crazy baby  
You just gotta be, outta your mind  
As long as I'm payin' the bills  
I'm payin' the cost to be the boss

I sit by my window, watch the clouds go by  
Every moment is a one that I'm  
Crying my heart out cause I'm not there with you  
I feel like a fool I've got so much shame  
I know I should just walk away  
But what will I do with all this pain I feel for you  
  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'll have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this time  
  
So many nights I lay in bed  
I stare at the place where you laid your head  
I wonder who's lying with you instead of me  
I can't make you feel it if it isn't there  
No way to convince you if you just don't care  
Look in your heart maybe you could spare a place for me  
  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'd have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this time  
  
You made your point  
It's clear to me  
There's somewhere else you'd rather be  
But I can't bear the thought of life without you  
  
I sit by my window, watch the clouds go by  
But I can't bear the thought of life without you  
  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'd have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this.  
Please don't leave me  
Not this time  
I don't think I can survive it  
I'd have nothing  
Not even my pride  
So please don't leave me  
Not this time

I don't want to argue about who is the victim  
Cause maybe we both got burned  
I don't want to talk about who is the traitor  
Cause both of our loyalties turned  
I don't want to fight about who is the liar  
Cause there's too many ways to lie  
I don't want to hear about who is the winner  
Cause we both know it's a tie  
Cut it out, drop it, count me out, baby stop it  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time  
  
You were on a liquid diet, you were sure you had to try it  
And you lost all your pounds  
The doctor's on vacation, so you took the medication  
And wound up in lost and found  
So we took a trip to Paris  
Cause you swore that it would scare us out of our swift decline  
All that I remember 'bout those days in that September  
Is the "merci" and the wine  
  
Cut it out, drop it, count me out - baby stop it  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time  
Life is too short, so why waste  
Precious time, precious time, precious time  
Oh, precious time  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time  
  
You talk on the telephone, long distance to new york or Rome  
Some would say you got it made  
Your home is like a fortress, no one comes in but the florist  
The gardener, and the maid  
You call me on the telephone, you say you feel so alone  
Too tired to get dressed and get out  
First you're happy, then you're sad  
Somehow you always hang up mad  
Excuse me if I shout  
  
Cut it out, drop it, count me out, baby stop it  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time  
Precious time, precious time, oh precious time  
Life is too short, so why waste precious time

Cold hard labor, it's a labor of love  
Convicted of crimes, the crimes of passion  
Caught in a chain gang, the chain of fools  
Solitary confinement, confined by the rules  
  
I'm just a Prisioner  
An inmate of love  
Oh I'm a Prisioner  
Captured by love  
With no escape  
No where to go  
No place to hide  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner!  
I'm just a Prisioner  
  
Mending the wounds, the wounds of lament  
The knife cut deep, deep into my heart  
The romance is over, my passions remain  
Still bound to love by this ball and chain  
  
I'm just a Prisioner  
An inmate of love  
Oh I'm a Prisioner  
Captured by love  
With no escape  
No where to go  
No place to hide  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner!  
I'm just a Prisioner  
  
Oh I'm a Prisioner  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner!  
  
Find an escape, a key to the door  
I gotta get out, can't take anymore  
Make a clean break, to bury the past  
I'll shed these chains and be free at last  
  
I'm just a Prisioner  
A Prisioner Of Love  
I'm just a Prisioner  
A Prisioner Of Love  
Hey, I'm a Prisioner  
I'm just a Prisioner

Fire walkers feel no pain from the coals  
Ruled by passion beyond their control  
Vengeance is king in the zone of Red Vision  
Sparks fly and tempers flair  
You see the enemy everywhere  
Hate shines like burning bridges in your eyes  
In love and war we stand alone  
Trustin' nothin' but our own, Red Vision  
  
Anger sharpens your point of view  
Fans the fire in and around you  
Fahrenheit in the realm of your senses  
In love and war we stand alone  
Trusting nothing but our own, Red Vision  
  
Mind like a steel trap, heart like a prison  
With tears of rage, we burn in our Red Vision  
  
Once again, I'll walk the coals  
Tiptoe through the minefields of your soul  
I've come to take you home  
  
Red Vision  
Red Vision  
Red Vision  
Red Vision  
  
Oh, Red Vision.......

He used to be somebody's baby  
Someone used to hold him close, and rock him gently  
He used to be the light in someone's eyes  
He used to matter, he used to matter  
Someone cared if he lived or died  
Someone held him in their arms - when he cried  
And when he hurt, someone kept the world away  
Someone loved him, someone loved him  
  
He used to be somebody's baby  
Someone used to hold him close, and rock him gently  
He used to be the light in someone's eyes  
He used to matter, he used to matter  
He used to matter  
  
That was then, that was so long ago  
Long before they came and took his soul  
Long before he became invisible  
That was when, he wasn't human garbage then  
  
He used to be somebody's baby  
Someone used to hold him close, and rock him gently  
He used to be the light in someone's eyes  
He used to matter, he used to matter  
He used to matter  
He used to be somebody's baby

How am I supposed to make it through another day  
What am I supposed to do now that you've gone away  
Is there anything encouraging you can say to me  
Did you really think my heart was made of stone  
Maybe you never gave it any thought at all  
How nice to go through live oblivious and free  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience  
How am I supposed to ever feel the same  
These kind of situations always have a way  
Of screwing up your mind and messing with your sanity  
How many days and nights will have to come and go  
Before I realize what I already know  
I'm better off without you like I thought I'd be  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience  
(spoken) life is sweet  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience  
Life is sweet, sweet as strawberry wine  
And bitter too, like the seeds on the vine  
And you are that, you are more than sublime  
And bitter too, lovin' you, has been an experience  

You were the one who made me lose control  
Just when I needed to be on my own  
You had an answer, but no alibi  
You're fellin' sorry 'cause there's no time to lie  
So what, you deserve everything that you got  
You think I'm gonna be there, but I'm not  
So Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I don't think you want to bother me  
  
Don't bother runnin' through the old routine  
Your words are weak and they don't mean a thing  
You had your chances and you threw 'em away  
You said the "turnaround" was in fair play  
So what, you deserve everything that you got  
Ya' think I'm gonna be there, but I'm not  
  
So Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I don't think you want to bother me  
  
I don't want to be the one accused  
You never thought you'd see the day  
It'd come back on you  
  
You hate to say that maybe you were wrong  
You want contentment, but ya' can't be that strong  
You see the shadow on the window blind  
But that shadow will never be mine  
So what, you deserve everything that you got  
Ya' think I'm gonna be there, but I'm not  
  
So Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I don't think you want to bother me  
  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
Take It Any Way You Please  
Take It Any Way You Want It  
But I don't think you want to bother me

When they found you, you were driven and hungry  
You were playin' for your life then  
You were livin' for the chance to be heard  
What they promised, what they offered  
Was more than you'd ever hoped for  
To walk away, ya' know that would've been absurd  
And talk about absurdity, it was madness  
It was everything in excess  
It was too much, too many, and too little time  
It was faceless people in jackets and ties  
Who thought of you when they made love to their wives  
Somehow, it wasn't what you had in mind  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back  
So they might as well get used to the idea  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
You got no one to blame but yourself  
So don't put it on nobody else  
Put it behind you, start over, today  
  
There were parties and photos and televised award shows  
And covers of magazines  
There was gold and platinum and everyone was smiling  
You were coming apart at the seems  
There were jerk offs too numerous to mention  
When everybody shared the dream  
But when it came time to share the nightmare  
They were conveniently nowhere to be seen  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Oh they'll argue what they gave you was exactly what you wanted  
And just to be fair, ya' know that some of it's true  
That's why ya' gotta be careful, 'bout your wishes  
Take your time and think 'em over  
Sometimes those wishes just might come true  
  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back  
So they might as well get used to the idea  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
Tell 'em you've had enough, and if they don't like it it's tough  
You're Takin' It Back, those cooperation days are over  
You're Takin' It Back  
Tell 'em you're Takin' It Back

I'm the one you put all your stories on  
She's the one, you keep it a secret from  
She believes you, just like I did at the start  
When you wrapped up my heart, and played with my emotions  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell it to her  
Cause I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I know why she would  
There's a fool born every minute  
When you're in it, it feels so good  
Why don't you tell it to her  
  
She don't know the darker side of you  
She don't know what your love will put her through  
Your sweet talkin' makes her feel so safe and sure  
But that won't change what you are  
And I'm the one who knows it  
  
[Chorus[  
  
'Cause I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I know why she would  
There's a fool born every minute  
When you're in it, it feels so good  
  
You're the one who had it all and wanted more  
But you can't do it to me anymore  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
I don't want to hear it  
Tell it to her  
Go on and tell it to her  
Tell it to her  
There's a fool born every minute  
Tell it to her  
Go on and tell it to her  
Tell it to her

Why do I have these thoughts go through my head  
Do they come out of the air  
Suspicion always washes over me like a disease  
I cannot share I can't ignore the way you treated me sometimes  
So go ahead and convince me otherwise  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Tell me it's okay, that every thing's fine  
Show me that it's possible not to cry, swear that you'll  
Never leave and you'd rather die than hurt me  
Just tell me that every thing's gonna be fine  
  
Give me a reason why I should stay  
One I won't regret in the end  
This time say something I can believe  
Something you haven't used yet  
I can't ignore the way you treated me sometime  
So go ahead and convince me otherwise  
  
So many empty words were spoken here today  
So many promises I'd like to dream away  
Like verses whispered in some ancient ritual  
That accusations fly, but we are no closer to the truth

Bells will be ringing, the glad - glad news  
For what a Christmas to have the blues  
My baby's gone and I have no friends  
To wish me greetings once again  
Oh, crowds will be singing Silent Night  
Christmas carols by candlelight  
  
Please come home for Christmas  
Please come home for Christmas  
If not for Christmas, by New Year's night  
  
Friends and relations, send salutations  
As sure as the stars shine above  
Yes it's Christmas, Christmas my dear  
It's the time of the year -- time of the year  
To be with the one you -- the one you really love  
  
Oh won't you tell me, we'll never grow old  
  
Christmas and New Years will find you home  
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain  
Because I'll be happy that it's Christmas once again  
  
Please come home for Christmas baby  
They'll be no more sorrow, no more grief and pain  
Because I'll be happy, Lord I'll be so happy  
Happy once again

I've seen all the downfalls  
Temporary Heroes (Whoa)  
Misguided direction  
Longing for perfection (Whoa)  
Love and pain  
Only for the foolish  
Once again  
Try to hide what's there inside  
I'm the same, Temporary Hero  
Who's to blame  
  
Rituals and movements  
Much too soon improvements  
Hide many scars)  
Others and ours  
Too late to discover  
This untainted love is  
Destined to be)  
A sad memory  
  
Love and pain  
Only for the foolish  
Once again  
Try to hide what's there inside  
I'm the same, Temporary Hero  
Who's to blame  
  
So you take your chances  
Watchful of the glances  
But don't turn away  
Though the wounds are healing  
Don't tell me the feelings the same  
  
Love and pain  
Only for the foolish  
Once again  
Try to hide what's there inside  
I'm the same, Temporary Hero  
Who's to blame

We got it all but it ain't enough  
No, we're never ever happy with what we got  
I see that look on your face, you know I've seen that look before  
Don't you be fooled baby, you gonna show  
It's just Temptation, Whoa... Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Must be Temptation  
  
Too far to fall but we always do  
Though we swore in our hearts to be true  
You say that hand that your holdin' feels a little cold sometime  
Baby sooner or later, you're gonna find that true love..  
  
Is just like Temptation, Whoa... Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Feels like Temptation  
Now listen here... Whoa... Temptation  
Whoa... Temptation Whoa....  
  
We want it all and we want it fast  
No time to think, no time to ask  
But you know that road that we're on don't always lead to happiness  
You can count on it baby  
It's a pretty good guess now all we got  
  
Is just Temptation, Whoa... Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Feels like Temptation  
Temptation Whoa... Looks like Temptation  
Temptation -- Must be Temptation Yeah

Here we go again  
'Round and 'round again  
Gettin' nowhere fast  
It's the same old thing  
  
One more final scene  
Never meant to last  
Who'll be the first one who's leaving  
Who'll be the last one to cry  
  
Something just keeps me believing  
In our love tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't seem to say goodbye  
Though I've tried a million times  
The more I learn, the less I know  
About the art of letting go  
  
So we take our time  
And we make our moves  
Oh, so carefully  
Old ways seem so safe  
Habits hard to break  
When you're here with me  
  
I don't know how hard to hold you  
No easy way to be free  
Something just keeps me believing  
That we're meant to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For we all feel  
And we all know  
It's not easy  
Letting go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We got beyond letting go  
(We got beyond letting go)  
You gotta let go  
You gotta let go  
Yeah, yeah

Movin' light, dream machinery  
Crashin' in, through my balcony - oh no  
I shout down the line but could not get through  
Cause the telephone never rings when you want it to  
  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
  
Words of love take your breath away  
Just a game that you like to play - oh no  
Sleepwalking through a world of pain  
Just another pretty face, in the romeo rain  
  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned  
Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
  
Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
You know your paint by number life does not excite you  
It's a watercolor world that you're livin' in  
And when you close your eyes at night  
You're wonderin', just where you've been  
  
You were young when you heard the call  
Saw it all in your crystal ball and chains  
A problem child who can pick and choose  
When the sandman calls your name, you cannot refuse  
  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland - Ooh  
Ooh, Ooh...Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
Chemical decisions never turn out like you planned  
Now You're Wide Awake In Dreamland  
In Dreamland  
In Dreamland
