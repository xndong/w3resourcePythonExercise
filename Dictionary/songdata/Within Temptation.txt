Take away,  
these hands of darkness.  
Reaching for my soul.  
Now, the cold wind  
blows out my candles.  
Feeling,  
only fear,  
without any hope.  
  
A thousand dark moons.  
A thousand winters long.  
A million fallen stars,  
the candle burns in the womb  
  
We try not to forget,  
they live through us.  
Slowly they die away at every candle's end  
  
A thousand dark moons,  
A thousand winters long.  
A million fallen stars,  
the candle burns in the womb.  
  
We try not to forget,  
They live through us  
Slowly they die away at every candle's end.

Why was I one of the chosen ones  
Until the fight I could not see  
The magic and the strength of my power  
It was beyond my wildest dreams  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
  
Don't you die on me  
You haven't made your peace  
Live life, breathe, breathe  
Don't you die on me  
You haven't made your peace  
Live life, breathe, breathe  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
  
(Ah...)  
  
As they took your soul away  
The night turned into the day  
Blinded by your rays of life  
Gave us the strength we needed  
  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down  
Dark wings they are descending  
See shadows gathering around  
One by one they are falling  
Every time they try to strike us down

He feeds on fear  
He feeds on hate  
He rules again  
With growing hate  
He will gain their faith again  
Light in the darkness is too small to see  
There's always a sparkle of hope  
If you just believe  
  
He told the tale so many times  
About the dream not meant to be  
In the world of the free  
He plays with your mind  
As faith for the future faded fast  
He grows strong with their displeasure  
It sets him free  
  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules with fear  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules again  
  
He feeds on fear  
Poisons the truth  
To gain their faith  
To lead the way  
To a world of decay  
  
He rules your heart  
He will sell your soul to the grave  
Without a hesitation to make  
He belongs to the dark  
  
Please awake  
And see the truth  
He can only be  
If you believe what he tells you  
Remember who you are  
What you stand for  
And there will always be a way  
  
In my heart there is a place  
In my heart there is a trace  
Of a small fire burning  
A sheltering ray shines through this night  
Although it's small, it's bright  
But darkness is lurking  
He will sell your soul to bitterness and cold  
All fear him  
  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
He rules with fear  
Deceiver of hearts  
Deceiver of fools  
Shall he rule again?

I did my best to please you  
But my best was never good enough  
Somehow you're only able to see  
All I am not  
Did you ever look behind?  
Aren't you afraid of the pieces you'll find?  
I have failed you  
But you have failed me too  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life, why didn't you ever try?  
I close my eyes as I walk the thin line  
Between love and hate  
For the person with the same blood  
In his veins  
You show no regrets  
About all the things you did or said  
I have failed you  
But believe me you failed me too  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
In your life, why didn't you ever try?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?  
It's so easy to destroy and condemn  
The ones you do not understand  
Do you ever wonder if it's justified?

Can I swallow the soil  
Make it all beautiful?  
Can I carry it, carry it, carry it now?  
  
The truth can't bare the sunlight  
You're afraid for the day it does  
Hell when I told you so  
I got burn, burn, burned again  
  
Heaven forbid that my heart is forsaken  
Hope in the end truth prevails  
  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Need to find my way home, home  
  
He earns fire as a god  
But I believed in your heart  
And I'm leaving you, leaving you, leaving you now  
  
The truth can't bare the sunlight  
And don't pretend to be my guide  
Heard you said you'd change it over  
But I got burn, burn, burned instead  
  
Heaven can wait cause my soul is forsaken  
Hope in the end truth prevails  
  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Feel that I'm gonna get home if I try  
I'm gonna run to the edge of the world, run to the edge of the world  
Need to find my way home, home  
  
Just to fall out, no more rain  
Once upon a time

The gates of time have opened  
Now, its chains are broken  
An ancient force unleashed again  
As I enter the portal I feel the enchantment  
It takes me away, away from here  
  
Come near me,  
Enter my private chambers  
I want to feel the warmth on my face,  
Light-in darkness, lift me up from here  
Give me your wings,  
To flee from my ivory tower  
  
As I enter the portal  
I feel the enchantment  
The stars above are lying at my feet  
  
Come near me,  
Enter my private chambers  
I want to feel the warmth on my face,  
Light in darkness, lift me up from here  
Give me your wings,  
To flee from my ivory tower

I escaped my final moment  
But it's turning back at me  
On every corner I can feel it waiting  
Just a moment, no awareness  
I could easily slip away  
And then I'll be gone forever  
  
I'm searching,  
I'm fighting for a way to get through  
To turn it away  
  
It's waiting, always trying  
I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating  
Tell me what's the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Can't take it no more!  
  
All around me I see danger  
And it's closing in on me  
Every second I can hear it breathing  
I can't stand the fear inside me  
Cause it's leading me astray  
And it will be my ending  
  
I'm searching  
I'm fighting for a way to get through  
To turn it away  
  
It's waiting, always trying  
I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating  
Tell me what's the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Can't take it no more!  
  
But no one faced what's coming my way  
And I will let my fear fade away  
Whatever may be, I'll have to find out  
  
It's waiting, always trying  
I feel the hands of fate, they're suffocating  
Tell me what's the reason  
Is it all inside my head  
Can't take it no more

Every word you're saying is a lie  
Run away my dear  
But every sign will say your heart is dead  
  
Bury all the memories  
Cover them with dirt  
Where's the love we once had  
Our destiny's unsure  
  
Why can't you see what we had  
Let the fire burn the ice  
Where's the love we once had  
Is it all a lie?  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
I'm breathing but why?  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
Closer to insanity  
Buries me alive  
  
Where's the life we once had  
It cannot be denied  
  
Why can't you see what we had  
Let the fire burn the ice  
Where's the love we once had  
Is it all a lie?  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
I'm breathing but why?  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
You run away  
You hide away  
To the other side of the universe  
where you're safe from all that hunts you down  
But the world has gone  
Where you belong  
And it feels too late so you're moving on  
Can you find your way back home?  
  
And I still wonder  
Why heaven has died  
The skies are all falling  
I'm breathing but why?  
In silence I hold on  
To you and I  
  
Every word you're saying is a lie.

Couldn't save you from the start  
Love you so it hurts my soul  
Can you forgive me for trying again  
Your silence makes me hold my breath  
Time has passed you by  
  
Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world  
Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own  
Here I am left in silence  
  
You gave up the fight  
You left me behind  
All that's done's forgiven  
You'll always be mine  
I know deep inside  
All that's done's forgiven  
  
I watched the clouds drifting away  
Still the sun can't warm my face  
I know it was destined to go wrong  
You were looking for the great escape  
To chase your demons away  
  
Oh, for so long I've tried to shield you from the world  
Oh, you couldn't face the freedom on your own  
And here I am left in silence  
  
You gave up the fight  
You left me behind  
All that's done's forgiven  
You'll always be mine  
I know deep inside  
All that's done's forgiven  
  
I've been so lost since you've gone  
Why not me before you?  
Why did fate deceive me?  
Everything turned out so wrong  
Why did you leave me in silence?  
  
You gave up the fight  
You left me behind  
All that's done's forgiven  
You'll always be mine  
I know deep inside  
All that's done's forgiven

Now the day has come.  
We are forsaken this time.  
  
We lived our lives in our paradise,  
as gods we shaped the world around.  
No borderlines we'd stay behind,  
though balance is something fragile.  
  
While we thought we were gaining,  
we would turn back the tide, it still slips away.  
Our time has run out, our future has died,  
there's no more escape.  
  
Now the day has come,  
we are forsaken,  
there's no time anymore.  
Life will pass us by,  
we are forsaken,  
we're the last of our kind.  
  
The sacrifice was much too high,  
our greed just made us all go blind.  
We tried to hide what we feared inside.  
Today is the end of tomorrow.

I can't feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
All colors seem to fade away  
I can't reach my soul  
  
I would stop running  
If I knew there was a chance  
It tears me apart to sacrifice it all  
But I'm forced to let go  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?  
  
I can feel your sorrow  
  
You won't forgive me  
But I know, you'll be alright  
It tears me apart that you will never know  
But I have to let go  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen but what can I do?  
  
Everything will slip away  
Shattered pieces will remain  
When memories fade into emptiness  
Only time will tell it's tale, if it all has been in vain  
  
I can't feel my senses  
I just feel the cold  
  
Frozen  
What can I do?  
Frozen  
  
Tell me I'm frozen but what can I do?  
Can't tell the reasons, I did it for you  
When lies turn into truth, I sacrificed for you  
You say that I am frozen, Frozen

Cold are the bones of thy soldiers  
Longing for home, their little paradise  
I don't feel redemption on their side  
  
Fallen from grace, help me rise again  
Fallen from grace, help me through  
Fallen from grace, help me through  
Fallen from grace  
  
Feel these hands, the pressure, the cold, tremble  
Do you hear these words  
Do you feel the wounds  
I'll never help you through  
  
Cold are thy souls  
I feel resentment,  
they feel betrayed  
They hate the cold  
I don't feel redemption on their side  
  
Fallen from grace, help me rise again  
Fallen from grace, help me through

The child without a name grew up to be the hand  
To watch you, to shield you or kill on demand  
The choice he'd made he could not comprehend  
His blood a grim secret they had to command  
  
He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life  
He prayed for both but was denied  
  
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed  
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?  
So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?  
Will all our sins be justified?  
  
The curse of his powers tormented his life  
Obeying the crown was a sinister price  
His soul was tortured by love and by pain  
He surely would flee but the oath made him stay  
  
He's torn between his honor and the true love of his life  
He prayed for both but was denied  
  
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed  
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?  
So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?  
Will all our sins be justified?  
  
Please forgive me for the sorrow, for leaving you in fear  
For the dreams we had to silence, that's all they'll ever be  
Still I'll be the hand that serves you  
Though you'll not see that it is me  
  
So many dreams were broken and so much was sacrificed  
Was it worth the ones we loved and had to leave behind?  
So many years have past, who are the noble and the wise?  
Will all our sins be justified?

When leaves have fallen  
And skies turned to grey  
The night keeps on closing in on the day  
A nightingale sings his song of farewell  
You better hide for her freezing hell  
  
On cold wings she's coming  
You better keep moving  
For warmth, you'll be longing, nightingale  
Come on just feel it  
Don't you see it?  
You better believe  
  
When she embraces  
Your heart turns to stone  
She comes at night when you are all alone  
And when she whispers  
Your blood shall run cold  
You better hide before she finds you  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Haven't you seen?  
Haven't you seen?  
The ruins on our world  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Haven't you seen?  
Haven't you seen?  
The ruins on our world  
  
She covers the earth with a breathtaking cloak  
The sun awakes and melts it away  
The world now opens its eyes and sees  
The dawning of the new day  
  
On cold wings she's coming  
You better keep moving  
For warmth, you'll be longing, nightingale  
Come on just feel it  
Don't you see it?  
You better believe  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Haven't you seen?  
Haven't you seen?  
The ruins on our world  
  
Whenever she is raging  
She takes a life away  
Haven't you seen?  
Haven't you seen?  
The ruins on our world

In my hands a legacy of memories  
I can hear you say my name  
I can almost see your smile  
Feel the warmth of your embrace  
But there is nothing but silence now  
Around the one I loved  
Is this our farewell?  
  
Sweet darling you worry too much  
My child, see the sadness in your eyes  
You are not alone in life  
Although you might think that you are  
  
Never thought this day would come so soon  
We had no time to say goodbye  
How can the world just carry on?  
I feel so lost when you are not by my side  
But there is nothing but silence now  
Around the one I loved  
Is this our farewell?  
  
So sorry your world is tumbling down  
I will watch you through these nights  
Rest your head and go to sleep  
Because my child this is not our farewell  
This is not our farewell

("I speak to you for the first time as Prime Minister in a solemn hour for the
life of our country, of our empire, of our allies, and, above all, of the
cause of Freedom.")  
  
Sanctus Espiritus redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus! Sanctus Espiritus!  
  
In my darkest hours I could not foresee  
That the tide could turn so fast to this degree  
Can't believe my eyes  
How can you be so blind?  
Is the heart of stone, no empathy inside?  
Time keeps on slipping away and we haven't learned  
So in the end now what have we gained?  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony?  
  
Are they themselves to blame, the misery, the pain?  
Didn't we let go, allowed it, let it grow?  
If we can't restrain the beast which dwells inside  
It will find it's way somehow, somewhere in time  
Will we remember all of the suffering  
Cause if we fail it will be in vain  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony  
  
("A tremendous battle is raging in France and Flanders. The Germans, by a
remarkable combination of air bombing and heavily armored tanks, have broken
through the French defenses north of the Maginot Line, and strong columns of
their armored vehicles are ravaging the open country, which for the first day
or two was without defenders. They have penetrated deeply and spread alarm and
confusion in their track.")  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony!  
  
Sanctus Espiritus, redeem us from our solemn hour (Solem hour!)  
Sanctus Espiritus, insanity is all around us (All around us!)  
Sanctus Espiritus, is this what we deserve,  
Can we break free from chains of never-ending agony

Where are the heroes  
In my time of need?  
Is my cry not loud enough  
Or have they gone all numb?  
They just tend to stand  
Out of the rain  
Thinking but not acting  
That they're not to blame  
Falling and crawling  
A fight to stand up  
Memory still haunts me  
In the dead of night  
Over and over, I felt so small  
But one day I'll be stronger  
And you better watch out  
I will overcome, your violence their silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
Where are the saviors?  
Afraid of the toll  
Sorry, do my nine inch nails  
Slash your soul  
Such heroes  
Throwing stones  
Straight at the one  
Who is standing alone  
Twisting and turning  
It's always the same  
Truth is never honest  
When you're to blame  
Pushing and pulling  
Never give in, one day I wish  
You'll see you're not so beautiful within  
I will overcome, our violence your silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
Run and run  
Run and run  
I will overcome, their violence your silence  
Although it can't be undone  
I will overcome, knowing that I'm not the only one  
I will overcome, it's the only way to carry on  
I will overcome  

The world seems not the same,  
though I know nothing has changed.  
It's all my state of mind,  
I can't leave it all behind.  
I have stand up to be stronger.  
  
[Chorus]  
I have to try to break free  
from the thoughts in my mind.  
Use the time that I have,  
I can't say goodbye,  
have to make it right.  
Have to fight, cause I know  
in the end it's worthwhile,  
that the pain that I feel slowly fades away.  
It will be alright.  
  
I know, should realize  
time is precious, it is worthwhile  
Despite how I feel inside,  
have to trust it will be alright.  
Have to stand up to be stronger.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, this night is too long.  
I have no strength to go on.  
No more pain, I'm floating away.  
Through the mist I see the face  
of an angel, who calls my name.  
I remember you're the reason I have to stay.  
  
[Chorus]

I'm waking up to ash and dust  
I wipe my brow and I sweat my rust  
I'm breathing in the chemicals  
  
I'm breaking in, shaping up  
Then checking out on the prison bus  
This is it, the apocalypse  
Whoa  
  
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones  
Enough to make my systems blow  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive  
  
I raise my flags, don my clothes  
It's a revolution, I suppose  
We'll paint it red to fit right in  
Whoa  
I'm breaking in, shaping up  
Then checking out on the prison bus  
This is it, the apocalypse  
Whoa  
  
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones  
Enough to make my systems blow  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive  
  
All systems go, sun hasn't died  
Deep in my bones, straight from inside  
  
I'm waking up, I feel it in my bones  
Enough to make my systems blow  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age  
Welcome to the new age, to the new age  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive  
Whoa, whoa, I'm radioactive, radioactive

She embraced with a smile  
As she opened the door  
A cold wind blows  
It puts a chill into her heart  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
Past and present are one in her head  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my love I gave to you  
  
You have taken away the trust  
You're the ghost haunting through her heart  
  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my life I gave to you  
Take my hand as I wonder through  
All my love I gave to you

It doesn't hurt me.  
Do you want to feel how it feels?  
Do you want to know that it doesn't hurt me?  
Do you want to hear about the deal that I'm making?  
You, it's you and me.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
Be running up that building.  
If I only could, oh...  
  
You don't want to hurt me,  
But see how deep the bullet lies.  
Unaware I'm tearing you asunder.  
Ooh, there is thunder in our hearts.  
  
Is there so much hate for the ones we love?  
Tell me, we both matter, don't we?  
You, it's you and me.  
It's you and me won't be unhappy.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
Be running up that building,  
Say, if I only could, oh...  
  
You,  
It's you and me,  
It's you and me won't be unhappy.  
  
"see'mon, baby, see'mon darling,  
Let me steal this moment from you now.  
see'mon, angel, see'mon, see'mon, darling,  
Let's exchange the experience, oh..."  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.  
  
And if I only could,  
I'd make a deal with God,  
And I'd get him to swap our places,  
Be running up that road,  
Be running up that hill,  
With no problems.

Say my name  
So I will know you're back you're here again  
For a while  
Oh let us share  
The memories that only we can share  
Together  
  
Tell me about  
The days before I was born  
How we were as children  
These colors come alive  
In your heart and in your mind  
I cross the borders of time  
Leaving today behind to be with you again  
  
We breath the air  
Do you remember how you used to touch my hand?  
You're not aware  
Your hands keep still  
You just don't know that I am here  
  
It hurts too much  
A pray now that soon you release  
To where you belong  
  
You touch my hand  
These colors come alive  
In your heart and in your mind  
I cross the borders of time  
Leaving today behind to be with you again  
  
Please say my name  
Remember who I am  
You will find me in the world of yesterday  
You drift away again  
To far from where I am  
When you ask me who I am  
  
Say my name  
These colors come alive  
In your heart and in your mind  
I cross the borders of time  
Leaving today behind to be with you again  
  
Say my name

Is it true what they say,  
Are we too blind to find a way?  
Fear of the unknown clouds our hearts today.  
Come into my world,  
See trough my eyes.  
Try to understand,  
Don't want to lose what we have.  
  
We've been dreaming  
But who can deny,  
It's the best way of living  
Between the truth and the lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
See who I am,  
Break through the surface.  
Reach for my hand,  
Let's show them that we can  
Free our minds and find a way.  
The world is in our hands,  
This is not the end.  
  
Fear is withering the soul  
At the point of no return.  
We must be the change  
We wish to see.  
I'll come into your world,  
See trough your eyes.  
I'll try to understand,  
Before we lose what we have.  
  
We just can't stop believing  
Because we have to try.  
We can rise above  
Their truth and their lies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I hear their silence  
Preaching my blame.  
Will our strength remain  
If their power reigns?  
  
[Chorus]

I've been left out alone like a damn criminal  
I've been praying for help cause I can't take it all  
I'm not done,  
It's not over.  
  
Now I'm fighting this war since the day of the fall  
And I'm desperately holding on to it all  
But I'm lost  
I'm so damn lost  
  
Oh I wish it was over,  
And I wish you were here  
Still I'm hoping that somehow  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
In the blink of an eye  
I can see through your eyes  
As I'm lying awake I'm still hearing the cries  
And it hurts  
Hurts me so bad  
  
And I'm wondering why I still fight in this life  
Cause I've lost all my faith in this damn bitter strife  
And it's sad  
It's so damn sad  
  
Oh I wish it was over,  
And I wish you were here  
Still I'm hoping that somehow  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
I feel you fading away  
  
Cause your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
Oh, your soul is on fire  
A shot in the dark  
What did they aim for when they missed your heart?  
  
I breathe underwater  
It's all in my hands  
What can I do  
Don't let it fall apart  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
A shot in the dark  
  
A shot in the dark

Till another little ray  
Care about the day your heart breaks up  
When you lose your way  
  
I'm hellbound in this life  
Keep fighting the coldest wars  
It's always been like this but don't know why  
  
And sleeping in your mind  
You feel it, ties you down  
Going down  
I'll go by  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
It's where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
But I'm still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I can't breathe  
Woo  
  
These days are only now  
Breathe in the coldest lies  
I think it's only what you have in mind  
Hold onto the best of you  
I hit the pavement  
Going down  
Don't know why  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
It's where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
But I'm still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I can't breathe  
  
No, I'm patient  
But this colours that I live  
All alone in this life  
I cannot see  
Dreams we hide are solid  
But we can't let her bleed  
Maybe what we make  
Can you see?  
Oh  
  
(I will fight in this life  
Defying the coldest wars  
It's always been like this  
But don't know why)  
  
No  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
Frozen into me  
Hunted for the vertical sealed before that  
It's where I wanna be  
Screaming at the walls of fire  
I'm still running free  
In the silver moonlight  
I can't breathe  
Woo  
(Your fear will chain you down)  
  
Till I know a little rain  
Care about the day your heart breaks up  
When you lose your way

I've gotta try  
It's not over yet  
No signals of love  
Have you left  
My heart is bleeding just for you  
Bleeds for only you  
  
And it hurts to know the truth  
  
Are you looking for saviours  
Chasing a dream  
Love turned to hate  
  
Now I'm crossing the border  
See then I fade  
But I'm not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it, I know  
  
Oh Sinead,  
It's the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me  
  
This second chance I know won't last  
But it's OK  
Got not regrets  
And I, I feel the end here  
I'm a fool  
Getting closer  
  
But I'm doing what I should  
I been drowning in sorrow  
Chasing tomorrow,  
Running away  
  
Now you're crossing the border  
See no tomorrow  
But you're not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it, I know  
  
Oh Sinead,  
It's the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me  
  
But I'm doing what I should  
I've been drowning in sorrow  
Chasing tomorrow,  
Running away  
  
Now you're crossing the border  
See no tomorrow  
But you're not afraid  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it  
  
Oh Sinead,  
For the first time  
Love is gonna turn around  
I'm telling you  
You will like it, I know  
  
Oh Sinead,  
It's the first time  
Only you can set it free  
Oh Sinead  
Come break away with me.

Lost in the darkness, hoping for a sign  
Instead there is only silence  
Can't you hear my screams?  
Never stop hoping  
Need to know where you are  
But one thing is for sure  
You're always in my heart  
  
I'll find you somewhere  
I'll keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul  
  
Lost in the darkness, try to find your way home  
I want to embrace you and never let you go  
Almost hope you're in heaven  
so no one can hurt your soul  
Living in agony cause I just do not know  
Where you are  
  
I'll find you somewhere  
I'll keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul  
  
Wherever you are, I won't stop searching  
Whatever it takes, I need to know  
  
I'll find you somewhere  
I'll keep on trying until my dying day  
I just need to know whatever has happened  
The truth will free my soul

(Freedom) Your call is coming  
I'm dreaming away  
For what lies hidden  
It needs to be found  
  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found  
They will lead us to tomorrow  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
(Freedom)Voices forgotten  
I hear them close by  
Ghosts from the past I can see through their eyes  
Are these the ancestors leaving me signs?  
  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found  
They will lead us to tomorrow  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
The sounds, they are all around  
Forces start moving out  
Taking sides, though there's so much  
That I need to know  
And soon it will be shown  
  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found  
They will lead us to tomorrow  
Sounds of freedom make me wanna try  
  
When the ghosts are found, they will lead us to tomorrow  
When the ghosts are found, they will lead us to tomorrow  
  
If we could restart how it was before tomorrow

Seven seconds to the rise  
Can't believe I'm still alive  
And heaven was waiting for me  
I thought this would be the end  
But I know you'll understand  
All that is keeping me here  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that I'm only one step behind  
  
I sense this time I may have changed  
But one this still remains  
I'm torn and the hate still lingers  
I slowly start to realize  
We won't reunite  
I still have to march on through  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that I'm only one step behind  
  
Is it a curse or a fortune?  
Have I been blinded by regret?  
Redemption awaits  
My soul is at stake  
Will I find a stairway to the skies  
In the end?  
  
I dream of a stairway to the skies  
My angel is coming down from heaven to take me  
I reach out but then you fade away  
Whenever you call for me  
Know that I'm only one step behind  
Know that I'm only one step behind

I can see  
When you stay low  
Nothing happens  
Does it feel right?  
Late at night  
Things I thought I'd put behind me  
Haunt my mind  
  
I just know there's no escape now  
Once it sets it's eyes on you  
But I won't run  
Have to stare it in the eyes  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in  
No more denying  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
Stand my ground  
  
It's all around  
Getting stronger, coming closer into my world  
I can feel that it's time for me to face it  
Can I take it?  
  
Though this might just be the ending  
Of the life I held so dear  
But I won't run  
There's no turning back from here  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in  
No more denying  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
Stand my ground  
  
All I know for sure is that I'm trying  
I will always stand my ground  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in, (I won't give in)  
I won't give up, (I won't give up)  
No more denying (ah)  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
  
Stand my ground  
I won't give in  
No more denying  
I've gotta face it  
Won't close my eyes and hide the truth inside  
If I don't make it, someone else will  
Stand my ground

Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby, you the best  
  
I got my red dress on tonight  
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight  
Done my hair up real big, beauty queen style  
High heels off, I'm feelin' alive  
  
Oh my God, I feel it in the air  
Telephone wires above  
Are sizzlin' like a snare  
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere  
Nothin' scares me anymore  
(1, 2, 3, 4)  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby, you the best  
  
I got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness  
  
I'm feelin' electric tonight  
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99  
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side  
I know if I go, I'll die happy tonight  
  
Oh my God, I feel it in the air  
Telephone wires above  
Are sizzlin' like a snare  
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere  
Nothin' scares me anymore  
(1, 2, 3, 4)  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby, you the best  
  
I got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness  
  
Think I'll miss you forever  
Like the stars miss the sun in the morning sky  
Later's better than never  
Even if you're gone I'm gonna drive  
  
I got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness  
  
Kiss me hard before you go  
Summertime sadness  
I just wanted you to know  
That baby, you the best  
  
I got that summertime, summertime sadness  
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness  
Got that summertime, summertime sadness

I've been losing myself beneath this, so much broken by the rain  
Nothing can take my mind off how to make them pay  
Give up myself to nothing, then the pain will go away  
Losing myself to know this, I've been going away  
  
If I could turn the hands of time  
I would, but here I am  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on?  
Gotta turn it down to let it go  
  
I do turn to keep on trying, but I spend it to the end  
Knowing that there's no person for my rising side  
I've buried again in evil, always the one who's left behind  
I am the one who's standing, I will live to tell  
  
If I could turn the hands of time, I would, but here I am, here I am  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on?  
Gotta turn it down to let it go  
  
Tell me why I'm wasting away  
Tell me how to be my own change  
Cause I've been losing it too long  
Tell me how to stand here and fight  
Tell me how to face my own day  
Cause I'm still standing  
  
I'm still standing, such as a fighter  
I've got to fight for all of it  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
  
Tell me why am I still here when I'm so dead?  
I am just a ghost of yesterday  
Tell me why am I still trying to hold on?  
Gotta turn it down to let it go

Nothing's ever changed, you still turn away  
You've washed your hands, you've made that all too clear  
You just keep on living this lie  
  
You refuse to see, you're denying me  
The cross I bear but you don't seem to care  
Even Judas knew he had lied  
  
I keep wondering why  
I'm still calling your name through my tears  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear?  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why  
I'm still calling your name my dear  
  
I'm sorry if you can't stand the naked truth  
All you see is how you want it to be  
So you keep on living your life  
  
Release me from this cross after all these years  
Oh call my name and help me with this weight  
Even though it comes far too late  
  
I keep wondering why  
I'm still calling your name through my tears  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name  
And I wonder, oh I wonder ...  
  
In my heart I still hope you will open the door  
You can purify it all, answer my call  
  
Why? Why?  
  
Why have you waited to embrace me my dear?  
Cold is your silence, denying what is real  
I'm still wondering why I'm still calling your name  
And I wonder, oh I wonder ...  
  
In my heart I still hope you will open the door  
You can purify it all, answer my call

Someone is dancing on my grave  
Sending shivers down my spine  
I hear a laugh, it awoke my soul  
The wind takes the leaves  
Where he wants them to go  
His tunes enchant our world  
Our thoughts and leave us frozen  
In this heart of mine, it's you I find  
Take my hand  
I'll take you to the promised land  
You're the one  
I hear a laugh, it awoke my soul  
The wind takes the leaves  
Where he wants them to go  
His tunes enchant our world  
Our thoughts and leave us frozen  
In this heart of mine, it's you I find  
Take my hand  
I'll take you to the promised land  
You're the one  
Nevil, whatever you have done  
These tears will fade  
Nevil, wherever you have gone  
Please have faith  

Nor the pain and the sorrow caused by my mistakes  
Won't repent to a mortal whom is all to blame  
Now I know I won't make it  
There will be a time we'll get back our freedom  
They can't break what's inside  
  
I'll face it cause it's the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what you've become, don't sacrifice  
It's truly the heart of everything  
  
(Open up your eyes, open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes, it's the heart of everything  
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes, open up your eyes)  
  
Stay with me now I'm facing my last solemn hour  
Very soon I'll embrace you on the other side  
Hear the crowd in the distance, screaming out my faith  
Now their voices are fading, I can feel no more pain  
  
I'll face it cause it's the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what you've become, don't sacrifice  
It's truly the heart of everything  
  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes  
Open up your eyes  
Save yourself from fading away now, don't let it go  
Open up your eyes  
See what you've become, don't sacrifice  
It's truly the heart of everything

We've been seeing what you wanted, got us cornered right now  
Fallen asleep from our vanity, might cost us our lives  
I hear they're getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
They're coming down the hills from behind  
  
When we start killing  
It's all coming down right now  
From the nightmare we've created,  
I want to be awakened somehow  
(I want to be awakened right now!)  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that we're in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing...  
  
We've been searching all night long but there's no trace to be found  
It's like they all have just vanished but I know they're around  
I feel they're getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
They're coming down the hills from behind  
  
When we start killing  
It's all coming down right now  
From the nightmare we've created  
I want to be awakened somehow  
(I want to be awakened right now!)  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that we're in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing...  
When we start killing...  
  
I feel they're getting closer  
Their howls are sending chills down my spine  
And time is running out now  
They're coming down the hills from behind  
  
The sun is rising  
The screams have gone  
Too many have fallen  
Few still stand tall  
Is this the ending of what we've begun?  
Will we remember what we've done wrong?  
  
When we start killing  
It's all coming down right now  
From the nightmare we've created  
I want to be awakened somehow  
(I want to be awakened right now!)  
  
When we start killing it all will be falling down  
From the Hell that we're in  
All we are is fading away  
When we start killing...  
When we start killing...  
When we start killing...

Over the hills lies a new beginning, over the hills  
Over the hills there is a way I know it, over the hills  
You can't bring all the gloom  
(Your heart is frayed and so empty)  
You glorify the future  
(Living in a different world than me)  
The journey ends in death  
(You are giving up so easily)  
You are the other half of me  
Over the hills, over the hills  
Over the hills, over the hills  
We are drifting apart  
(Chilled to the marrow 'cause you don't want to go)  
'Cause we've got a different wish at heart  
(The amulet guides us to the other side)  
When I go down it's you who'll bleed  
(I'm not scared to die, as long as I'm with you)  
You are the other half of me  
Over the hills lies a new beginning, over the hills  
Over the hills there is a way I know it, over the hills  

On behalf of her love  
She no longer sleeps  
Life had no longer meaning  
Nothing to make her stay  
She sold her soul away  
  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
  
After the night he died  
I wept my tears until they dried  
But the pain stayed the same  
I didn't want him to die all in vain  
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time  
I'll make them bleed down at my feed  
  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
  
Sometimes I wonder  
Could I have known  
About their true intentions  
As the pain stayed the same  
I'm going to haunt them down all the way  
I made a promise to revenge his soul in time  
One by one they were surprised  
  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed  
I held you tight to me  
(But) you slipped away  
You promised to return to me  
And I believed

Would you mind if I hurt you?  
Understand that I need to  
Wish that I had other choices  
Than to harm the one I love  
What have you done now?  
I know I'd better stop trying  
You know that there's no denying  
I won't show mercy on you now  
I know I should stop believing  
I know there's no retrieving  
It's over now, what have you done?  
What have you done now?  
I, I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
Would you mind if I killed you?  
Would you mind if I tried to?  
'Cause you have  
Turned into my worst enemy  
You carry hate that I don't feel  
It's over now, what have you done?  
What have you done now?  
I, I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done now?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
What have you done?  
I will not fall, won't let it go  
We will be free when it ends  
I, I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you  
I've been waiting for someone like you  
But now you are slipping away  
What have you done now?  
Why, why does fate make us suffer?  
There's a curse between us, between me and you
