With the world upon your shoulders...  
Lord you gave your life away  
If the world I know was over...  
I know I'd have life in the price You paid

All for love a Father gave.. For only love could make a way... All for love
the heavens cried.. For love was crucified.  
  
Oh, how many times have I broken your heart... But still you forgive if only I
ask..  
And how many times have you heard me pray..Draw near to me..  
  
Everything I need is You  
My beginning and forever  
Everything I need is You  
  
Let me sing all for love.. I will join the angel song. Ever Holy is the Lord,
King of Glory, King of All.  
  
All for love a Saviour prayer.. Abba Father have your way.. Though they know
not what they do.. Let the cross draw man to you

I wanted to find  
Where I was going  
Everything I tried  
It took me nowhere  
I was so tired of just living my life  
Waiting for a sign  
You came to my side  
Gave me direction  
Strong on the inside  
I shine for You Lord  
Now it's my time  
Now I've made up my mind  
To be all You want for me  
All I do  
Is live my life for You  
I know it's true  
I'll never let You go  
All I do  
I'd anything for You  
Everything is in Your Hands  
So I get up  
Get up and praise You  
And I know where I'm going  
I know where I'm going

I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken  
I'm accepted, You were condemned  
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me  
Because You died and rose again  
  
I'm forgiven, because You were forsaken  
I'm accepted, You were condemned  
I'm alive and well, Your Spirit is within me

That You my King would die for me  
Amazing love, I know it's true  
It's my joy to honor You  
Amazing love, how can it be  
That You my King would die for me  
Amazing love, I know it's true

You make Your face to shine on me  
And that my soul knows very well  
You lift me up, I'm cleansed and free  
And that my soul knows very well  
  
When mountains fall, I'll stand  
By the power of Your hand  
And in Your heart of hearts I'll dwell  
And that my soul knows very well  
  
Joy and strength each day I find  
And that my soul knows very well  
Forgiveness, hope, I know is mine  
And that my soul knows very well

Verse:  
For you, I'd climb the highest height  
I'd dive the deepest sea

For you, I'd fall upon my knees  
Cry out night and day  
Search for more of you  
  
Pre-Chorus:  
And I would give my riches away  
They're nothing without you

Something to live for

Explorers and soldiers  
  
Searching and fighting  
To learn, to realize  
  
Straight through our soul  
With invisible thread  
The pieces undone  
Are whole now instead  
  
The fight we're in  
Has already been won  
  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
  
Your story was made of  
Beauty and soul  
We're closer to heaven  
Than we'll ever know  
  
Woven in time  
  
To breathe and create  
A sacred thing  
  
The fight we're in  
Has already been won  
  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come  
Arise  
For the kingdom has come

Take my life I lay it down  
At the cross where I am found  
All I have I give to You oh God  
  
Take my hands and make them clean  
Keep my heart in purity  
That I may walk in all You have for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh here I stand  
Arms open wide  
Oh I am Yours  
And You are mine  
  
Take my moments and my days  
Let each breath that I take  
Be ever only for You oh God  
  
[Chorus]  
  
My whole life is Yours  
I give it all  
Surrendered to Your Name  
And forever I will pray  
Have Your way  
Have Your way

I say on Sunday how much I want revival  
But then on Monday, I can't even find my Bible  
Where's the power  
The power of the cross in my life  
  
I'm sick of playing the game of religion  
I'm tired of losing my reason for living  
Where's the power  
The power of the cross in my life  
  
I'm not content just to walk through my life, giving in  
To the lies, Walking in compromises now  
We cry out as a generation that was lost  
But now is found in the power of the cross  
  
Chorus:  
We believe in You  
We believe in the power of Your Word that is true  
We believe in You  
So we lay down our cause  
That our cross might be found in You  
  
I'm not satisfied doing it my own way  
I'm not satisfied to do church and walk away  
I'm not satisfied there's no love in my life but You  
I'm not satisfied living in yesterday's hour  
I'm not satisfied to have the form but not the power  
I'm not satisfied, Lord I am crucified in You  
[Chorus:]  
  
So we lay down our cause  
That our cross might be found in You

This is my revelation  
Christ Jesus crucified  
Salvation through repentance  
At the cross on which He died  
  
Now hear my absolution  
Forgiveness for my sin  
And I sink beneath the waters  
That Christ was buried in  
  
[Chorus:]  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
  
I stand a new creation  
Baptized in blood and fire  
No fear of condemnation  
By faith I'm justified  
  
[Chorus:]  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
[X2]  
  
I rise as You are risen  
Declare Your rule and reign  
My life confess Your Lordship  
And glorify Your Name  
Your Word it stands eternal  
Your Kingdom knows no end  
Your praise goes on forever  
An on and on again  
  
No power can stand against You  
No curse assault Your throne  
No one can steal Your glory  
For it is Yours alone  
I stand to sing Your praises  
I stand to testify  
For I was dead in my sin  
  
[Chorus:]  
But now I rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
  
I will rise, I will rise  
As Christ was raised to life  
Now in Him, now in Him  
I live  
[X2]

Better Than Life  
Words and Music by Marty Sampson  
  
Better than the riches of this world  
Better than the sound of my friend's voices  
Better than the biggest dreams of my heart  
And that's just the start  
  
Better than getting what I say I need  
Better than living the life that I want to  
Better than the love anyone could give  
Your love is  
  
You hold me now in your arms  
And never let me go  
  
You oh Lord make the sun shine  
And the moon light in the night sky  
You give me breath and all your love  
I give my heart to you because  
  
I can't stop falling in love with you  
I'll never stop falling in love with you  
I can't stop falling in love with you  
I'll never stop falling in love with you

To you my love, my joy, my song  
I lift my voice, my heart and soul  
In worship  
  
As eagles soar across the sky  
So my spirit reaches high  
Toward you  
  
As the deer pants for the water so  
My soul cries for you  
As a child has rest in arms of love  
So I rest in you  
  
You are the great and mighty  
Risen lord my king of glory  
Oh my soul bless the lord  
  
You reign in strength and power  
Awesome god my strong tower  
Oh my soul bless the lord

Oh dear God we ask for your favour  
Come and sweep through this place  
Oh we desire You  
  
I just want to be with You be where You are  
Dwell in your presence oh God  
Oh I want to walk with You  
  
And I will climb this mountain  
And I'll step of the shore  
And I have chosen to follow  
And be by Your side forever more  
  
Tell me what You want me to do Lord God  
Tell me what You want for my life  
Its Your's Oh God it's Yours  
Do your will  
Have Your way  
Be Lord God in this place  
Oh I want Your will to be done

Can't Stop Praising  
Words and Music by Tulele Faletolu and Marty Sampson  
  
Try to find the words  
To express the way you are  
But the beauty of the lord  
Cannot be described in just one lifetime  
  
Look at the sun over the seas  
Look at your grace that covers me  
Now I know  
Yes I know  
Now I know  
I know your love has saved me  
  
In the morning  
I can't stop praising your name  
In the evening  
I can't stop praising your name  
In the morning  
I can't stop praising your name  
In the evening  
I can't stop  
  
And I want you to know  
Yes I want you to know  
Oh yes I  
  
Lord you're so amazing  
Every word you say is true  
Better than the finest treausre  
So glad that I found you  
  
You held me close  
When I was down  
Your world has turned my world around  
Now I know  
Yes I know  
Now I know  
I know how much I love you  
  
Hallelujah  
We praise your name  
We praise your name

Chorus:  
Can't stop talking 'bout everything He's done  
It's the best thing, happened since the world began  
It didn't come cheap but I got it for free  
It's the hope of glory, Christ in me  
  
He helped me to see when my spirit was blind  
It's amazing if you look just what you'll find  
Every step I took, He took two  
If He did it for me, He can do it for you  
  
Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)  
Do you know what I say is true?  
Do you know Him? (Yes, I do)  
If He did it for me, He can do it for you  
[Verse:]

Let my walk speak loud  
And my words be true  
Let my life be whole  
With my eyes on you  
Lord I'm stepping out  
From the comfort zone  
Letting go of me,  
Holding onto You  
  
Freedom comes  
When I call You Lord  
You are Lord my God  
  
You are the centre of it all,  
The universe declares in awe  
Your majesty  
I surrender all  
I make you  
The centre of my life  
Lord, I respond with all I am  
You placed in me the song  
Of heavens melody  
Your Majesty  
I live to sing Your song  
  
I have found Your peace  
It replaces any fear  
You have done it all  
I can trust in you  
So I'm stepping out  
From the comfort zone  
Letting go of me  
Holding onto you  
  
This is your song not mine  
It is your song that bring healing to this land  
This is your song not mine  
It is your song that brings feedom  
Freedom comes, when I call you Lord  
Freedom comes, when I call you Lord  
You are Lord, my God  
You are the song  
You are the majesty  
I live to sing your song  
Your majesty  
I live to sing Your song

[Verse:]  
Children in the wilderness  
Following the love You poured out for us  
Covered by the Name that we confess  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Roaming through the dark of night  
Clinging to the word that burns deep inside  
Eyes fixed on Your Name and endless light  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place  
Under Your Name  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Walking on through the fire  
Knowing I will not be burned but refined  
Fearless in Your Name ever by my side  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
Taking on the raging storm  
Anchored to the kingdom unshakable  
Holding to Your Name that outshines all  
Jesus Saviour forever  
  
[Chorus:]  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place  
Under Your Name  
  
[Bridge (x2)]  
Children of the light  
Blazing through the night  
Taking back what the devil had stolen  
  
Calling on Your Name  
Breaking every chain  
Jesus everlasting freedom  
  
Running through the wild  
Dancing in the fire  
Taking back what the devil had stolen  
  
Calling on Your Name  
Breaking every chain  
Jesus everlasting freedom  
  
[Chorus:]  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place  
  
Set alight to follow  
In the shadow of Your Name  
The world is Yours and I know  
Everything will find it's place  
Under Your Name  
Jesus under Your Name  
  
[Outro:]  
Jesus  
All the power  
All the glory  
All the praise be to Your Name forever  
All the power  
All the glory  
All the praise be to Your Name forever

The Holy Spirit is here and His power is real  
Anything can happen and it probably will  
Something very good something good is going on around here  
  
There's a light that shines to make the dark disappear  
A power at work but there's nothing to fear  
Something very good something good is going on around here  
  
This is a church on fire  
This is the Holy Spirit flame  
We have a burning desire  
To lift up Jesus' name  
Let the fire burn in every heart  
To light the way, defeat the dark  
Let the flame of love burn higher  
This is a church  
This is a church on fire

I tempered the storm  
Though your faith was small  
I prayed while you slept  
And the night waged war  
We stood at the fire  
And we walked on sea  
And we drank of the wine  
That was made of me  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't turn your eyes from me  
For my love won't be undone  
Don't hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
I carried that cross  
And I felt your pain  
I took up your crown  
And I wore your shame  
And death was a fire  
And its teeth were grim  
But I left it behind  
Along with all your sins  
  
[Chorus 2]  
Don't turn away from me  
For my love won't be undone  
Don't hide your face from me  
For my light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love won't let you go  
And I won't forsake you  
Lift up your eyes and see  
Heaven is closer than you know  
Know I'll never leave you  
  
So lift up your voice and sing  
Know that My love won't let you go  
And My light has surely come  
Surely come, surely come  
  
And I'm closer than you know  
And I'm closer than you know  
  
[Bridge]  
Lord I hear you I know You're there  
Closer now than my skin and bones could bare  
Breathing deep within me  
You are always with me  
I can see you where eyes can't stare  
Brighter now than the sun could ever dare  
Breathing all around me  
God I know you're with me here  
(God I know that you are here)  
  
For I am yours and you are mine  
And my soul knows well  
You are here  
You are here  
And my soul will praise you  
And my soul will praise Your name  
Singing Holy is your name  
Jesus  
Jesus

There must be more than this,  
O breath of God come breathe within,  
There must be more than this,  
Spirit of God we wait for You.  
Fill us anew we pray,  
Fill us anew we pray.  
(Chorus)  
Consuming fire fan into flame,  
A passion for Your Name,  
Spirit of God won't you fall in this place,  
Lord have Your way,  
Lord have Your way with us,  
Come like a rushing wind,  
Clothe us with power from on high,

Stir it up in our hearts Lord,  
Stir it up in our hearts Lord,  
Stir it up in our hearts,  
A passion for Your Name.

Lord I come  
Lord I thank you  
For your love  
For this grace divine  
Love and mercy  
Undeserving  
You gave it all  
The greatest sacrifice  
  
You were wounded  
For my sin  
And You were bruised  
For all my shame  
You were broken  
For my healing  
Only by the cross  
I'm saved  
  
You're the mender of the broken  
To every outcast  
A friend and comforter  
  
I come boldly to your presence  
Lord I bow before your throne  
You're my healer  
My redeemer  
You're my hope, my life, my all  
  
You hear the cry of the broken  
You hear the cry of the broken  
You hear the cry of the broken  
  
You answer the cry of the broken  
You answer the cry of the broken  
You answer the cry of the broken

Light to men  
Love of God  
Healing for the wounded heart  
Like a child quiet my soul  
Hear Your voice surround me Lord  
  
Jesus, hold me into Your heart  
Into Your heart  
Lord my soul delights  
And I know You hear my prayer  
Take me deeper Lord  
  
Glorious Son to You I shall bow  
Bow my knee, bow my will  
Cherished by the strong and the weak  
Humble hearts shall hear You speak  
And by Your love Lord You opened my heart  
Now Your light will shine always  
By Your Word Lord Your promise secure  
And my soul will live always  
Take me deeper Lord

This is my prayer in the desert  
And all that's within me feels dry  
This is my prayer in the hunger in me  
My God is a God who provides  
  
And this is my prayer in the fire  
In weakness or trial or pain  
There is a faith proved  
Of more worth than gold  
So refine me Lord through the flames  
  
[Chorus]  
And I will bring praise  
I will bring praise  
No weapon forged against me shall remain  
  
I will rejoice  
I will declare  
God is my victory and He is here  
  
And this is my prayer in the battle  
And triumph is still on it's way  
I am a conqueror and co-heir with Christ  
So firm on His promise I'll stand  
  
All of my life  
In every season  
You are still God  
I have a reason to sing  
I have a reason to worship  
  
This is my prayer in the harvest  
When favor and providence flow  
I know I'm filled to be emptied again  
The seed I've received I will sow

Take this fainted heart  
Take these tainted hands  
Wash me in Your love  
Come like grace again  
  
Even when my strength is lost  
I'll praise You  
Even when I have no song  
I'll praise You  
Even when it's hard to find the words  
Louder then I'll sing Your praise  
  
[Chorus]  
I will only sing Your praise  
I will only sing Your praise  
I will only sing Your praise  
  
Take this mountain weight  
Take these ocean tears  
Hold me through the trial  
Come like hope again  
  
Even when the fight seems lost  
I'll praise You  
Even when it hurts like hell  
I'll praise You  
Even when it makes no sense to sing  
Louder then I'll sing Your praise  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And my heart burns only for You  
You are all You are all I want  
And my soul waits only for You  
And I will sing till the morning has come  
  
Lord my heart burns only for You  
You are all You are all I want  
And my soul waits only for You  
And I will sing till the miracle comes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Even when the morning comes  
I'll praise You  
Even when the fight is won  
I'll praise You  
Even when my time on earth is done  
Louder then I'll sing your praise  
  
I will only sing Your praise

All my days  
To worship you  
I will live  
All my days  
To worship you

As I look at the world  
I begin to dream of the future  
What's next to be  
Your love so strong for everyone  
You made us all in your image  
  
And you saved the day  
When Jesus came  
And You took away all my sin and shame  
And You made us right again  
  
You came from God above  
The Father's only Son  
Saved my soul  
Made me new  
Now I live for You  
  
My heart is alive and my spirit free  
In the Saviour  
Gave His life for me  
By Your Word  
We will be the light of the world  
My Father  
Shine Your light in me  
  
I'll stand on the Word  
Be a light in the world  
When Your praises are heard  
We'll be singing

Creator of the world  
  
And I stand in awe of you  
Of your glory

Cry out holy  
To the one who is to come  
Hear us sing hallelujah

May our streets be filled with joy.  
May injustice bow to Jesus  
As the people turn to pray.

From the heavens to the nations  
Hear our singing fill the air.

As we walk before the cross  
May Your glory fill the whole earth  
As the water o'er seas.  
  
From the mountains to the valleys  
Hear our praises rise to You,  
From the heavens to the nations  
Hear our singing fill the air.  
  
Hallelujah. Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah...  
Hallelujah, hallelujah  
Hallelujah, hallelujah... (x3)  
  
From the mountains to the valleys

From the heavens to the nations  
Hear our singing fill the air. "

Holy  
No measure knows Your worth  
Face down  
Where mercy finds me first

And I'll throw my weakness  
Into Your greatness  
If this broken heart is all You want

For You are worthy  
Jesus Saviour

When the music fades  
All is stripped away  
And I simply come  
Longing just to bring  
Something that's of worth  
That will bless your heart  
  
I'll bring you more than a song  
For a song in itself  
Is not what you have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
  
Chorus  
I'm coming back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about you  
It's all about you, Jesus  
I'm sorry Lord for the things I've made it  
When it's all about you  
It's all about you, Jesus  
  
King of endless worth  
No one could express  
How much you deserve  
Though I'm weak and poor  
All I have is yours  
Every single breath  
  
Chorus

Love strung out I am found in the price You paid  
I know that Your life is the blood running through my veins  
My eyes fixed wide on the light of the cross again  
I feel the weight drop in the wake of the empty grave  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
  
Heart beats loud to the sound of a different drum  
Calling me out from the crowd to pursue the One  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
  
Break me down till I soar on grace  
Lead me on through the fire and rain  
The rhythm of my heart beats wild  
For Your endless praise  
Every waking hour I will seek Your face  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
  
I want You, need You  
I love You Jesus  
My heart beats forever  
Just to know You  
Let go and throw  
My future into Your hands  
Again  
Again  
Again

Love that was foretold  
When the prophets spoke  
Of one to come  
  
Heaven came for us  
Reconciling hearts  
To You our God  
  
Heaven and earth collide  
The Savior for everyone has come  
Bringing the dead to life  
All for the glory of Your name  
  
Now He comes with hope  
In salvation's robe  
To lead us home  
  
Healing in His wings  
Freedom in His scars  
His kingdom come  
  
Heaven and earth collide  
The Savior for everyone has come  
Bringing the dead to life  
All for the glory of Your name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
  
Heaven and earth collide  
The Savior for everyone has come  
Bringing the dead to life  
All for the glory of Your name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
  
By His stripes we are healed  
By His death we can live  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name  
All oppression will cease  
Every captive released  
In Jesus name, in Jesus name

Come and change our hearts  
As we stand on Your word  
Holy Spirit, rain down  
  
No eye has seen, no ear has heard  
No mind can know what God has in store  
So open up heaven, open it wide  
Over Your church and over our lives

Into Your courts I run with praises  
Flowing from my heart  
Every day I wake I sing Your song  
It's the anthem of my life  
  
I want to spend my days  
In Your presence, Lord  
Bowed before Your throne  
In the house of God  
Is where I find my peace  
It's where I find my  
  
Home is heaven  
One day Lord, I will live  
In Your courts, You'll find me  
In worship at Your feet  
Hide me now  
In the shadow of Your wings  
Where I will be  
Where I will be  
  
Your love is all I need  
So desperately I have sought Your face  
I know You hear my every cry  
And petition that I make  
  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure  
Jesus, oh You are my treasure

For the love poured out  
For the price of freedom  
Let the whole Earth sing  
Hear the praises rising  
We stand in awe of what You've done for us at the cross  
  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know You forever  
To love You forever  
You are our everything  
  
Our sin erased  
We're forgiven  
You made a way  
You are our ransom  
We owe this life for all You've done for us at the cross  
  
The hope of the world  
Lifted on high  
Calling us home with arms out wide  
To know You forever  
To love You forever  
You are our everything  
[x2]  
  
All we need is You  
All we need is You  
All we need is You  
All we need is You

I see the King of glory  
Coming on the clouds of fire  
The whole earth shakes, the whole earth shakes  
I see His love and mercy  
Washing over all our sin  
The people sing, the people sing  
  
[Chorus]  
Hosanna, Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest  
Hosanna, Hosanna  
Hosanna in the highest  
  
I see a generation  
Rising up to take the place  
With selfless faith, with selfless faith  
I see a near revival  
Staring as we pray and seek  
We're on our knees, we're on our knees  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Heal my heart and make it clean  
Open up my eyes to the things unseen  
Show me how to love like You have loved me  
Break my heart for what breaks Yours  
Everything I am for Your kingdom's cause  
As I walk from earth into eternity  
  
Hosanna in the highest  
In the highest  
In the highest  
Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest  
  
Hosanna in the highest  
In the highest  
In the highest  
Hosanna, Hosanna in the highest

How could I live without You  
How could I survive  
Without Your love  
Without Your touch  
You're the One that heals me  
And cleanses my heart  
And sets me free  
  
Now I come right before You  
With my hands lifted up  
With my heart humbly bowed  
At Your work on the cross  
As You hang there and die  
You were paying the price  
For my life, For my life  
  
For Your love is higher than the heavens  
Deeper than the seas  
And all I want is You in my life  
No one else can satisfy my soul  
Can make me feel this way  
Only You Lord, only You

The universe is at Your feet  
Gives You praise  
Evermore  
The stars will light the sky for You  
Always  
God be praised  
And we sing  
The Lord is on high  
The Lord is on high  
  
I adore You  
I adore You  
And there's none that compares  
To Your majesty O Lord  
I adore You  
I adore You  
And I stand  
In wonder of Your love  
  
We will crown You  
King forever  
Living Saviour  
Jesus Redeemer  
Lord of Heaven  
Robed in majesty  
Crowned in glory  
Creation adores You  
  
Holy Holy  
God almighty  
And forever the Lord is exalted  
Hear the angels  
Shout His anthem  
Ever-living  
God we adore You

Standing tall in this wide space  
Getting lost in Your embrace  
I see a fire burning brighter  
It's calling me to catch the flame  
  
I feel like I'm falling over and over in love with You  
It's not just a feeling, but I know that He is real  
I feel like I'm falling into the arms of a mighty God  
It's not just a feeling, but I know that He is real  
  
You're drawing me closer to Your side  
It's the safest place I know where to hide  
With one glance You captured my heart  
You speak Your words and set me apart  
  
I feel like I'm falling, I feel like I'm falling  
I feel like I'm falling, falling into the arms of love

I know it, I know it  
His blood has set me free  
I've been delivered forgiven  
Fear has got no hold on me

Once lost, but now I'm found in You  
Once shipwrecked now I'm grateful these days  
I live for You

Overflowing into joy  
Like a downpour, Your spirit raining down  
Let it fall, Let it fall  
I'm living for the King  
I live for You

Say the word and I will sing for You  
Over oceans deep, I will follow  
If each star was a song  
And every breath of wind, praise  
It would still fail by far to say  
All my heart contains  
I simply live, I simply live for You  
  
Chorus:  
As the glory of Your presence  
Now fills this place  
In worship, we will meet You face to face  
There is nothing in this world  
To which You can be compared  
Glory on glory, praise upon praise  
You bind the broken hearted  
And save all my tears  
By Your word, You set the captives free  
There is nothing in this world  
That You cannot do  
I simply live, I simply live for You

Here I am  
Down on my knees again  
Surrendering all  
Surrendering all  
  
Find me here  
Lord as You draw me near  
I'm Desperate for You  
Desperate for You  
  
I surrender  
  
Drench my soul  
As mercy and grace unfold  
I hunger and thirst  
I hunger and thirst  
  
With arms stretched wide  
I know You hear my cry  
Speak to me now  
Speak to me now  
  
I surrender  
I surrender  
I wanna know You more  
I wanna know You more

Fall like fire, soak like rain,  
Flow like mighty waters, again and again.  
Sweep away the darkness, burn away the chaff,  
And let the flame burn to glorify Your name.  
  
There are higher heights, there are deeper seas,  
Whatever you need to do, Lord do in me.  
The Glory of God fills my life,

And I will never be the same again.  
And I will never be the same again.  
And I will never be the same again.

Your eye is on the sparrow  
And Your hand, it comforts me  
From the ends of the Earth to the depth of my heart  
Let Your mercy and strength be seen

As angels understand  
For Your glory, may You draw all men  
As Your love and grace demand  
  
And I will run to You  
To Your words of truth  
Not by might, not by power  
But by the spirit of God  
Yes I will run the race  
'Till I see Your face  
Oh let me live in the glory of Your grace

For You have set me free

As You gently call my name  
And let me see Your power and Your glory

With all my heart I long for You  
For I am caught in this passion of knowing  
This endless love I've found in You

To be called a child of God

Savior I come  
Quiet my soul, remember  
Redemption's hill  
Where Your blood was spilled  
For my ransom  
Everything I once held dear  
I count it all as lost  
  
[Chorus]  
Lead me to the cross  
Where Your love poured out  
Bring me to my knees  
Lord I lay me down  
Rid me of myself  
I belong to You  
Lead me, lead me to the cross  
  
You were as I  
Tempted and trialed  
You are  
The word became flesh  
Bore my sin and death  
Now you're risen  
  
Everything I once held dear  
I count it all as lost

Beautiful God  
Laying Your majesty aside  
You reached out in love to show me life  
Lifted from darkness into light  
Oh  
  
King for a slave  
Trading Your righteousness for shame  
Despite all my pride and foolish ways  
Caught in Your infinite embrace

Burning in my heart

Forever I'm humbled by Your love

Take my heart  
Take all that I have

Caught up in grace like an avalanche

I know You live again  
Your life for all my sin  
Now I stand here in  
In Your grace again  
  
As I look into the sky above  
Wonder how my life has changed  
Wonder how Your love, it came to me  
As I look into the sky above  
All my fears, so far away  
All I hear is heaven calling me  
  
So I look to You  
So I look to You  
No one else will do  
No one else will do

In Your justice and Your mercy  
Heaven walked the broken road  
Here to fight this sinner's battle  
Here to make my fall Your own  
  
Turn my eyes to see Your face  
As all my fears surrender  
Hold my heart within this grace  
Where burden turns to wonder  
  
I will fight to follow  
I will fight for love  
Throw my life forever  
To the triumph of the Son  
  
Let Your love be my companion  
In the war against my pride  
Long to break all vain obsession  
Till You're all that I desire  
  
Turn my eyes to see Your face  
As all my fears surrender  
Hold my heart within this grace  
Where burden turns to wonder  
  
I will fight to follow  
I will fight for love  
Throw my life forever  
To the triumph of the Son  
  
And I know Your love has won it all  
You took the fall  
To embrace my sorrows  
I know You took the fight  
You came and died but the grave was borrowed  
I know You stood again  
So I can stand with a life to follow  
In the light of Your name  
  
Turn my eyes to see Your face  
As all my fears surrender  
Hold my heart within this grace  
Where burden turns to wonder  
  
I will fight to follow  
I will fight for love  
Throw my life forever  
To the triumph of the Son  
  
And I know Your love has won it all  
You took the fall  
To embrace my sorrows  
I know You took the fight  
You came and died but the grave was borrowed  
I know You stood again  
So I can stand with a life to follow  
In the light of Your name  
  
And I know Your love has won it all  
You took the fall  
To embrace my sorrows
