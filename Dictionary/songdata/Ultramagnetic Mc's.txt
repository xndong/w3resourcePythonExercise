[Ed Lover]  
Ultramagnetic mc's  
I remember the first time I ever seen ultramagnetic, at Latin quarter  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Yeah!  
It's time to come out and give the people something they can understand  
Something not too complicated (cated)  
You know what we goin' do?  
We goin' bring it down to earth (earth)  
  
[Chorus: x4]  
Bring it down to earth, I don't understand!  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Mega bomb ignite, super reflection  
Power ignites the fourth horseman, turbo  
I kick styles like data, computer reading  
Miles away to beam star trek  
Moving my style up, optimus level 4  
I get it warp speed, youse on my space tour  
Get with the elements, eloquent spacecraft  
Change my gamma flow, one-three-eight-seven  
Twenty-oh-nine-six, cereal silver seven  
I got the skills to rap, so what you want spock?  
Style like captain kirk, gamma ray one block  
Particle leading out, rock the way intercourse  
Damaging animals, a lady with menopause  
Rising at one speed, altitude x be  
We need some gas or fuel, yo come in major!  
I'm just a level or pinch, I'm hitting new york  
Flying with ced, I see the other world  
I need some gas, yo Jim, I gotta come down  
Perimeter's reading we might crash!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Kool Keith]  
I know you out there and y'all understand  
But I'ma let Ced get on and tell y'all what it's really like  
It's not so complicated  
But connect with me and y'all follow me right on through!  
  
[Ced Gee]  
Yo  
Ultra power flowing, get ready for centron  
React with the digital, kicks like loose bombs  
High tech C-spects, hit data brain checks  
Sounding like john ?, time's up brain test  
Info storm, locked

[Kool Keith]  
Well I'm the equalizer, known to be graphic  
I clear static, breakin up traffic  
Move, while I enter the groove  
I'm on top, and happy to prove  
to wack MC's who claim to be better than  
No way I'm frankly more clever than  
all of you, each and every one, my son  
Pay close attention  
I take your brain to another dimension  
Hold it, mold it, shape it  
You got a knife, yes I wanna scrape it  
up and down, sideways, any way I can  
be rude to you  
But I'll rap and be crude to you  
And eat up, toy ducks I beat up  
I am the oven your brains I wanna heat up  
Mega, supersonic degrees  
I come around, roastin MC's  
with fire, to burn the toy liar  
Raw meat, turn the flame higher  
Cook it, like a fish I'll hook it  
For any beat, it's time that I took it  
right, correctly to the top  
with the rhythm and as your head bop  
I'm hype, for the critical beatdown!  
  
[Ced Gee]  
I'm attacking them, my job is stacking them  
For every rapper, must I be smacking them  
once, or twice in the face  
With rough beats, producin the bass  
that blow out, cause power to go out  
Inner spark, I'm ready to blow out  
like this, altitude level  
Reachin forth, stompin every devil  
in sight, you might just wanna bite  
My illusions, mental confusions  
You're a mark, skulls I've been abusin  
Losin, any rapper who follow me  
Your girl loves me, now she wanna swallow me  
Back up, move on to the rear  
When I'm on the stage should be clear  
Speakin, goin ear to ear  
Places far, ducks would appear  
for the countdown, so you wait to rhyme  
and twist, stuttering, uttering  
Parkay, margerine, everything butter  
and another thing, you shoulda been a Muppet  
A toy boy, a fake scream puppet  
I'm takin titles, and punks better up it  
to me, Ced Gee on the mic, and I'm hype  
for the critical beatdown!  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Here's the K, combined the double-O  
Swing in the L, I'm ready to go  
as Keith, Rap General Chief Executive  
plus exquisitive  
Mandatory, capital statements  
I am the teacher, preaching what makes sense  
Class, you wasn't able to pass  
For any germ or lice who come last  
I'm boric, high computing acid  
Get off the mic and won't you please pass it  
to me, for a one-two check  
Give me a pound and lots of respect  
No hands, you dissapointing my fans  
You on reverb, and talking to cans  
Hello - how are you doing?  
I come to wreck, and parties I'll ruin  
with rhymes, pumpin up smoke  
Diesel advances makin them choke  
and cough up, the hard-headed I'll soften  
spongee, then after that drink a ?  
Roll the sess, the buddha with the ganji  
Puff up, while I make tough stuff up  
I'm Kool Keith, cold rippin MC's  
I'm hype - for the critical beatdown!

It ain't nuthin Gee, it's just a small thing (4X)  
  
Hey, I got a flow that is wicked, so sit back while I kick it  
The incredible edible, change my pitch while I rip it  
We can make it just happen, while I'm keepin' you snappin'  
Now the style is correct, so I'ma keep gangsta rappin'  
'Cause I'm back and I'm flowin', I'ma keep people knowin'  
that I'm just like the Energizer (Still going!)  
So get that and make that, somethin' you think is real fat  
It's a small thing I'm back, on the Delta Force track  
As the figure get bigger, as the soul brother nigga  
I don't plan to waste time black, I just pull the trigger  
Now my mic is just smokin', like the 'are' I'm not jokin  
Fuck around, step to me troop, your big toes is broken  
Now I be the headbanger, releasin' more anger  
'Cause my fury is deep, so don't challengers scatter  
When I'm ? the head, I make beats that just flip  
So I write up a rhyme next, then flex  
Back at the ranch with the 4-H Horsemen  
The flavor is steady, move your head to the bass  
So check the rhymes and check my stats  
And now you know, that Ced Gee is back  
I'm still the Delta

Say what (yea) now ease back  
To the rear, you hear  
Eardrums drown, the bass pound  
Really stupid, we gonna loop this  
? scoop it, is that we rock it  
While ducks jock this  
Biting and writing and fighting for this  
Beats and wax, rhymes are facts  
Biting acts  
How we did it, for this one, that one  
Biters around, check out the sound  
In town, to the rhythm that we give 'em  
In fact you lack  
(Ultramagnetic) skills  
'Cause your record's no frills  
Here's your bill now ease back  
Ease back  
  
(Kool Keith)  
  
I'm back  
Back to smack attack  
Those who wack and lack my experience  
On the microphone holding my own ground  
Dominating forces  
Change the sources, punks takes losses  
Enough cause it's me on the mic  
Feeding on words, small like a nerd  
Haven't you heard this change of rhyme  
Continuing the land of time  
For my incredible, highly elevated  
Smooth in the mind, more sophisicated  
Motivated, as I relate it verbal  
Dissing a mouse and smacking any gerbel  
I bought a Saab, a 1990 Turbo  
Shining, fog lights in the front  
I'm by myself, no seats for a stunt  
'Cause I want it like that, I got it like that  
I have it like, I need it like that  
It's better like that, I made it like that  
I bought it like that, I'm living like that  
For you wack MC's  
Who go on the mic and blow on the mic  
And perpetrate frauds and making mistakes  
Like an amateur but I'm a 20 year veteran  
And better than, including the rest of them  
I chew 'em all and spit out the best of them  
One by one, I'm teaching my son  
To ease back  
Ease back  
  
(Seth G)  
  
What's up, it's me again  
I'm Seth G wit a funky blend  
Of beats and rhymes on time wit my DJ  
He's not weak wit anything he plays  
Rocking, slicing, rep is treacherous  
Like a professor, he had perfected this  
Simple potion, through devotion  
Wit his blends, his motions and fastly approaching  
Coasting, reaching higher levels  
So when you see 'em, you best say hello  
I'm a take out a knife,pen and paper and write  
A rhyme so dope you can't think, can't cope  
Ducks, who are you really kidding  
You say you're dope, well you're admitting  
That you can't compete because you're rhymes are weak  
Full of more nonsense, past tense, incomplete  
Weap and learn a new rap style  
From Seth G, the wizard of know how  
An innovation, elevation, psyching the nation  
When I ease back  
Ease back

[Keith] Yo whattup Ced Gee this beat is hype I'm feelin' it  
[C.Gee] Word up Kool Keith, yeah yeah  
Yo Moe Luv, tell em one more time how Kool Keith is feelin'  
"You've got the feelin"  
Word up I like that, one more time, one more time  
"You've got the feelin"  
Aight yo Keith, bust this, tell em how you REALLY feel  
  
[Kool Keith]  
Now here's a funky beat, my rhyme is updated  
For soft ducks, I played it once  
A biter jumped on it  
Girls got stupid, freaks humped on it  
And from the back, I pumped on it  
mostly, with skill, top finesse  
East to West, but I guess, I'm right  
while others are wrong  
Tryin to teach, and usin my song  
along, with your wiggedy-wack  
Stay back, get back, sit back down  
and think about it, whenever you're dissin me  
You are the roach, the six legs wishin me  
and pushin me, steadily on  
Metaphor, better for, psychin more  
On my tour, brains are sore  
I'll be sure, I'm fresher  
So tell me how I..  
duck, wack rappers around  
In town, never wearin no boots  
Toy Bally, sharkskin suits  
Rip a story, and threw his auditory  
Canal Street, is my territory  
For gold glory, reachin my hand  
to smack rappers, and makin em stand outside  
waitin for me, to tell them, my secret style  
And show them, how really it's done  
My son, now I'm back to you  
And if you're bad I'll smack you too  
A glass of rhymes, shattering  
Now you're cut up, say what up?  
Shut up, cause I'm feelin' it  
  
[TR L.] Yo that was dope!  
"You've got the feelin"  
[Keith] Whattup Trev I'm runnin America about right now  
Whassup with Ced Gee  
"You've got the feelin"  
[TR L.] Yo, Ced, you ready to get on and tell em how you feel?  
[C.Gee] Yeah word up, bust this  
Man I'ma do this  
"You've got the feelin"  
I might as well go do this right?  
[TR L.] Definitely man  
[C.Gee] Aight, do it  
  
[Ced Gee]  
Hello! I'm back again  
It's Ced Gee, the champion  
of knowledge and wisdom over all topics  
I'm the chief, the general prophet  
Topping, all the ducks who are delerious  
about rhymin, I'm more serious  
Like this, with twists as changes  
I took time, and rearranged this  
style like how versatile you ask me now wow  
I'm like ??  
The movie, you seen on TV  
I'll be numerous, but believe me  
I'll chop you up, bash your brain, rotate your liver  
Then I'm gonna give ya, a fresh rhyme, maybe  
Sealed and delivered, by me  
The manufacturer  
Straight out of Attica, I come after ya  
And if ya run, I have to damage ya  
mentally, by using my mind  
Choosing adjectives hard to define  
in rhymes, a dictionary wordpiece  
From the Brainiac, I blew your domepiece  
open, hopin you'll say to me  
"That was dope," like an anatomy  
operation on the turntables  
Slicing nerds with verbs, fully enabled  
Equipped, with a white handkerchief  
to wipe away the germs who wanna hang with this  
Ultra smoker, dope man, no joker  
With the line I wrote, and I quote them  
Cause I'm feelin' it!  
  
"You've got the feeling"  
[C.Gee] I feel it.. one more time man  
"You've got the feeling"  
[Keith] Just another Boogie Down Bronx sure shot  
"You've got the feeling"  
[C.Gee] Word up, 4-3 Mission posse in effect  
"You've got the feeling"  
To my man Tim Southfield  
? my next door neighbor  
Hollywood House family  
Oh the whole 9 crew, Dexter, everybody  
[TR L.] Brother Kevvy Kev, brother Kev  
Keith, Brother Kevvy Kev is in effect  
[C.Gee] Yo Calvin what's up?  
[TR L.] Jungle Brothers, Violators, the whole family man  
[C.Gee] London  
  
(We out!)

Well I'm sonicly, high bionically  
For you dummies, ironically stupid  
What are you, Cupid?  
You steal my rhymes, and then you loop it  
  
Wrong! Back this way  
Follow me now, head this way  
Into this, while I rap on through this  
For many germs, who never knew this  
  
Switches, upside down  
Turn around, look in the mirror  
You rap catchers are makin' a error  
Every inning, I'm back to the dugout  
  
You on the field, I'm ready to bugout  
Like a manager, smackin' up your team  
Male or female, ducks who dream  
Of takin' me, on the mic and makin' me  
Rack up, MC's I stack up  
  
Foreign precinct rappers need to back up  
Quickly, I'm a rip your brain off  
Throw it down so the blood can drain off  
My hands, while I wave to a fan  
  
I'm Kool Keith, not a Bill or a Dan  
But a General, equal to a mineral  
Pushin' a crowd, to keep on dancin'  
I'm Housing Things  
  
Now I'm back, to continue my verses  
I'm never screamin' loud with any curses  
Rougly, that a child can learn  
I teach kids and ducks that burn  
  
With a flamethrower, and how do you show a...  
Grass rapper, cut him with a lawnmower  
Twice, into golden wheat  
Ground the rest into moldin meat  
  
And cook em, til' they all well done  
They not ready, they don't smell done  
like fish, it ain't my favorite dish  
I grab a steak and to battle I wish  
  
A Coke MC or Pepsi I'll sip up  
Drop your face and bring the other lip up  
Watch, while I stun and amaze you  
Kick out lyrics that truly daze you  
  
I'm your boss, the one that pays you  
Nine to five, all ducks are hired  
And when I come MC's are fired  
No pay, no way today  
  
You're an employer with nothin' to say  
But I can say, one thing for sure  
I'm Housing Things  
  
I think it's pitiful, that you had taunted me  
Your girl sulkin', she wanted me first  
Before you was thought about  
Back in the days, when I taught about  
  
Science, the real construction  
No other solo team or production  
Did that, or got with that  
I play brain ball using a bat  
  
To your skull, smack it out the park  
I rhyme bright and you're in the dark  
With shadows, hallucinating battles  
To compel, the capital K, as in Kool  
  
Combined in Keith  
Rap metal is terminal chief  
And joy, squashin' the beef  
On time. and my mic will stay on  
  
For any roach or germ who wanna pray on  
a weakness, but my uniqueness  
has a way to show that I'm slicker  
Creating rhymes, you have to be, quicker  
And versatile on the microphone  
I'm Kool Keith, cold Housing Things  
  
And I'd like to say what's up to my man, Father Mashon  
And also my brother Kevvy Kev, Ced Gee, Moe Love, TR  
And my man I God, Paul C, Public Enemy and the Jungle Brothers  
Peace, I'm outta here

I get in shape and do my physical fitness  
Your head's numb, so your brains a miss this  
Pick 'em up, eat 'em up, pick 'em up, beat 'em up  
Pick 'em up pimple head, pick 'em up picky  
I roll wit globs and I come real sticky  
Ripping the mic, I plug it up in your ears  
Crazed and brewer. I'm coming out like beers  
Like Rheingold, Miller, Coors, and Buds  
I'm a eat 'em wit popcorn and treat 'em like suds you duds  
Coming out the wick wack, wicky, wick able wack  
Black jack, that's a fact, writing exact behind your back  
The funk rhyme to master, blaster  
Kicking up in a brainstorm, rainstorm  
Rap storm, rap form, rap time, rap rhyme  
Rap class, I'm here to fail and to pass  
To continue, from the more, hype tip  
I roll and rock, rock and roll  
Jazz and pop, rhythm and Blues  
Dance and fusion, pain confusion  
Look at the lights, what a night on the town  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
Now I'm back to funk, freak the funk  
Hype the funk, swipe the funk and all that junk  
I get busy on 'em, communicate wit the world  
Man, woman, a baby boy and a girl  
Poppa large looking out the pawn shop  
Taking stroud while your face and arms drop  
Stop, look, learn to read, learn to write learn to talk, learn to walk  
And watch your step though, I'm hype and ripe though  
Kleptomaniac, my rhyme is psycho  
A Ricky Ricardo, a Guy Lombardo  
Sporting a rag top, an El Dorado  
Step into Hollywood, I'm screening the boulevards  
The rhymes is gain type, I'm ready to pull it's card  
Jack or Ace, King or Queen, call me the deuce  
I'm pouring L.A. juice hitting the top, feeling the rim  
Getting a trim, I never rhyme like them  
On and on, on and on, on and on until the break of dawn  
I go overtime, rock the mic in nighttime  
Daytime, switching off to Prime time  
Specifically, strolling back in the west time  
Rock the funk wit the mic in the east rhyme  
Hype and dope, hype the frame, the mic is smoking  
Yo, I ain't joking  
Rhyme to kill, rhyme to murder, rhyme to stomp  
Rhyme to ill, rhyme to romp  
Rhyme to smack, rhyme to shock, rhyme to roll  
Rhyme to destroy anything toy boy  
On the microphone  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
You're dripping sweaty, coming hard on your neck  
As I flow and grow from head to toe  
Seeking a style like John McEnroe  
Dissing 'em all, serving them wit the mic stand  
Like Prince and Michael coming out wit a big band  
The crowd is loud, you can pay as the manager  
Run wit the money, I pull the trigger and damage ya  
Boom, taking life more serious  
I may sound lyrical and very mysterious  
Rhymes are grip tight, no grams to kill more  
A son of Sam, how could I begin more  
Grabbing the mic, you see the dark and shadows  
You're in living hell, the funk, pound to pound  
The funk ignited, hands are writing, brains dividing  
I'm coming out in sighting  
Like I'm Blackula, a better man that Dracula  
Spectacular and not irregular in fact you are speaking impopular  
Rhymes are moved and you can't be stop wit the  
Beat as it goes to the rhyme that flows  
Like a coke in a straw burning up in your nose  
That's a bad habit, stepping out on stage one  
Drop the mic, come and turn to page one  
Look at the master, my range is higher  
My lyrical burns, your brain's on fire  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  
I'm Poppa Large, big shot on the East coast  

[Kool Keith]  
Yo Don!  
I got a white... mask  
A black cape, two pair of silver gloves  
And nobody know who I am  
I will not take my mask off to reveal  
Check it out but I'ma drop lyrics  
You know what? Hit it  
  
Yo niggaz want to get in the backdoor, but fuck it  
Rappers can't rap a lick, chompin on other dick  
I gotta do this for X, and make them brothers quit  
Don't try that sissy shit, that gettin busy shit  
I bang a nail up in your dooty hole and booty quick  
Rappers know me, I'm bugged, I chop your ass right  
Take that body and bag it, then I'm out of sight  
I got the F.B.I., not the F.O.I.  
Tryin to find the design, and ? went underline  
The pure facts on the stupid wicked wax  
People they know, I'm out the hospital  
Cold buggin and illin like Dr. Doolittle  
You better walk up the street, now look around black  
  
See that man on the street, who's at the corner yea (8X)  
Back to hell to the graveyard  
With fog on the street, you see the Ghostrider home piss  
I walk down on your block and see you sleepin  
Cold jump in your bed, and fuck you up, yea yea  
Down with the X, I'm at the basement  
Got the body and bag, up on the pavement  
Cement I went, just hid em in the vent  
I put the rappers upstairs and let em air out  
Before the cops came, I cleaned the blood up  
I called detectives in town and said yo whattup  
I wasn't home - somebody's in my house  
I took them rappers back out, up in a pickup truck  
Think I'd tell on myself?  
  
See that man on the street, who's at the corner yea (10X)  
Yeah  
I'm not gon' reveal myself  
Still standing here with this black cape on  
White gloves, these big silver boots  
Ain't nobody notice

[Kool Keith]  
Yeah! We gettin ready to smear peanut butter in the crowd  
and throw mayonnaise all down your ears  
You know what? We got some jams for you boy  
Yo, the meltdown on em, check it out  
  
A lot of rappers, think they can rap and then do that  
Who dat Jumpin on my testicles, my black scrotum  
Show em that they style is cold butt, doo doo  
Like a baby's heiny, a stinky funky boo boo  
Kickin with more rounds, hi pops all sounds  
Get with the drift, what I'm sayin? Slayin  
Bringin MC's to the program  
Not like H-Town, soft on a slow jam  
I kick it wicked with the funky style lick it  
Suck it, jump on the jock just like a groupie woopi  
I make MC's look bad like Charlie Brown and Snoopy  
Your mother act wild, sister act goofy  
DJ's go wild and act retarded, illiterate  
Put me in the mix, well consider it, oh yeah  
I'm down to step and throw a gun in your face  
Hijack all that shit, spray your station with mace  
I got my things in effect, all plans down  
The boys ready, stupid crazy with they masks down  
I walk around, okay, you think I'm jokin?  
Just go to sleep and see what happen, remember  
Where could I be, when you're lonely for Tony  
Take him outside, on the highway for a ride  
Remember when the detectives come, you don't remember anything

As we search for black people and white people  
Seeking the world of the four horsemen facing  
John, henry, the robot, dr. smith, and will Robinson  
Come in please -- on track for the remix  
  
[kool keith]  
Adjusting our systems the horsemen are ready to go  
Our jets, should be ready for take off, any second  
  
Aheheheheheheheh!  
I probe for evidence, movin, positive beams  
Incite the first gadget, my atom explodes  
Just hit the fifth planet, the x reload  
Take a brother on a flight for the alpha, omega  
I kick lyrics on earth, you think I'm cosmic  
A spacewalker, dippin in my spacecraft  
Through molecules, a steel wall interphase  
The fourth horseman, legendary universe  
Dark shadow human rhymin on a funky verse  
I'm level 7, optimus pull back  
Feeding the world of gamma data, to locate  
You interlock, power 7 warp speed  
Negative charge, biochemically crush  
My own nucleus bomb, the great menudo  
Yo wolverine I'm down, cyclops, rhythm x  
X we can back up the four horsemen  
Toronto blue jays, field, just like dave winfield  
Pick up your bat and go to third  
I see that man at the plate, he's waitin home  
  
We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship! (3x)  
We are the horsemen -- enter!  
  
While, returning back to my spaceship  
On my galactic horse, this is what happened..  
  
[ced gee]  
I get super bionic  
No my name's not mantronix, but I'm 4-h-m  
Kickin flavor so steadily, so wickedy wicked  
Can I switchedy switch it, I saw my troops last night  
They said, "ced could you kick it?"  
I got mega in concert  
Then I wrote a deposit, I hit my mega-mini  
Zoom back to outer space, ten nine eight seven six  
Five four three - the chain reaction  
Triggered the mad flows, then the rhymin got hyper  
Plus I knew what they like-a, so I ripped it and rock it  
Frequencies in the pocket, one blast two blast  
Yes approximate, green in the chambers  
The lights came on, infrared and exciting  
Most don't know what I'm saying, galactic come beams  
Beams beams beams beams beams beams  
Beams beams beams...  
Now it's classic the atom, no I don't mean the phantom  
Molecules in the mix, with lots of protons to hand them  
Plus I'm billin the workers, secret charts led to persia  
When they're reachin their pick-up, I'ma crossover bezerker  
We turn to the galaxy, the universe bothers me  
From the wild wild west, I have a spaceship mentality  
When I chill at the planet, magnesium flip  
So I shake up the myolex, so what's left?  
  
We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship! (5x)  
Yee-hah, ride em silver, we out!  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, check it out, yeah..  
Jimmy cliff down with the horsemen  
Ron bordett down with the horsemen  
Doc doc down with the horsemen  
Kevvy kev down with the horsemen  
Kleptor down with the horsemen  
Drew love down with the horsemen  
Old maid down with the horsemen  
Chuck beats down with the horsemen  
Jazz down with the horsemen  
Kevvy kev down with the horsemen  
Cut cut down with the horsemen  
The whole world down with the horsemen  
All the honies down with the horsemen  
And we're out (yeahhhh) check it out  
  
We are the horsemen -- enter your spaceship! (7x)

Bobbito's in the house!  
I gotta say one thing, y'all been great playin the real shit

All this la-la-la and this, TLC condoms on your eyes and all that shit  
I'm not with that..  
  
Yeah! You listenin to the sounds, of the one, Rhythm X -- the man  
I'ma show you how to get wreck  
The right way, not the wrong way  
Watch me when I do this, pay attention  
  
Check it out  
Shut up! Step back! That picky-packy-wacky rap  
Your old flow is over and your rhyme style is over with  
In fact, big head, yo take it as a bigger diss  
I come walk in your show like David Berkowitz  
Make you think you swimmin like that homey Mark Spitz  
How can you put up a fox, against an ALLIGATOR  
I chew your crew one by one, like a Now or Later  
I make a heavy man light, turn a black kid white  
Bust a rhyme in they rectum, squeeze it tight  
I wreck shop like Rock the Ricky Wrecka  
Crush-a, stomp-a, nother, brother  
I make MC's go,
