Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo  
Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo  
  
Once upon a time there was a little boy who  
Played the ukelele. He'd go around town,  
'Blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp, blmp,  
BImp blmp blmp, blmp blmp, blmp!'  
Grown-ups said "Get that thing out of here!"  
  
Not only that, the boy's father was a gettin'  
In trouble. He was a magician. He had a  
Magic wand. He could go 'Zoop! Zoop!' make  
Things disappear. But the father played too  
Many tricks on people. Somebody doing a  
Hard job of work, 'zzt, zzt, zzt', up comes the  
Father with his magic wand, 'Zoop!' no saw.  
Come to someone about to drink a nice cold  
Glass of something, 'Zoop!' the glass  
Disappears, He'd come to someone about  
To sit down after a hard day's work, 'Zoopl'  
No chair.  
  
People said to the father, "You get out  
Of here, too. Take your magic wand and  
Your son!" The boy and his father were  
Ostracized. That means they made them  
Live on the edge of town.  
  
Now in this town they used to tell stories.  
The old people used to tell stories about  
The giants that lived in the old days They  
Used to tell a story about a giant called  
Abiyoyo. They said he was as tall as a  
House and could eat, people, up.  
Of course, nobody believed it, but they  
Told the story anyway.  
  
One day, one day, the sun rose, blood red  
Over the hill. And the first people got up  
And looked out of their window, they saw a  
Great big shadow in front of the sun. And  
They could feel the whole ground shake.  
'Stomp, stomp'. Women screamed, 'Ahh!'  
Strong men fainted "Ohh!" - "Run for  
Your lives! Abiyoyo's coming!"  
  
He came to the sheep pasture, grabs a  
Whole sheep, 'Yeowp!' Comes to the cow  
Pasture, grabs a whole cow, 'Yeowp!'  
Daniel, "Grab your most precious  
Possessions and run! Run!" Just then the  
Boy and his father woke up "Hey, Paw,  
What's coming over the field?" - Oh, Son,  
That's Abiyoyo. Oh, if I could only get him  
To lie down, I could make him disappear."  
  
The boy said "Come with me, Father." He  
Grabs his father by one hand. The father  
Gets the magic wand, the boy gets the  
Ukelele. They run across the field. People  
Yelled, "Don't go near him! He'll eat you  
Alive!" There was Abiyoyo. He had long  
Fingernails cause he never cut 'em.  
Slobbery teeth, cause he didn't brush  
Them. Stinking feet, 'cause he didn't wash  
'em. He raised up with his claws, the boy  
Whips out his ukelele and starts to sing.  
  
Well, you know the giant had never heard a song  
About himself before, and a foolish grin spread  
Over the giant's face. And the giant started to  
Dance "Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo," the boy  
Went faster, "Abiyoyo, yoyoyo, yoyoyo. Abiyoyo,  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo," The giant  
Got out of breath. He staggered. He fell down flat  
On the ground 'Zoop!, Zoop!' people looked out  
The window, Abiyoyo disappeared.  
  
They ran across the fields. They lifted the boy  
And his father up on their shoulders. They said,  
"Come back to town. Bring your damn ukelele,  
We don t care anymore!" And they all sang:  
  
Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo, Abiyoyo  
(Oh, you sing it with me,)

It ain't so much the boredom  
But the fire in her soul  
That made her life unbearable  
While living in that hole  
Of her dark surburban nightmare  
'Till she went to see the Dead  
And the self esteem she valued  
Was immediately spent  
And she had no one to turn to  
So she just turned off her mind  
She's a well adjusted wanderer  
But all this stuff takes time  
  
On the streets of old Wyoming  
There's a couple from L.A.  
They are post-environmentalists  
Looking for to stay  
'Till their friends all come to join them  
In the quest for air to breathe  
And when it gets too crowded  
They will just pick up and leave  
Like they did in New York City  
When the coast seemed quite sublime  
It don't take much but money  
And money just takes time  
  
Marie is on the lounge chair  
Draped around the pool  
Avoiding almost anyone who'd  
Desecrate he cool  
It's the reason she's attractive  
She's already self abused  
And her pride won't feel the loneliness  
That comes with being used  
She's the center of the universe  
For which she was designed  
Until she wakes up wandering  
Why all this stuff takes time  
  
Bill died of a heart attack  
Beating up his wife  
Now he's come back as a lesbian  
That's looking for his wife  
Who is now a psychoanalyst  
That likes to work with plants  
Except of course on weekends  
When she likes to wear the pants  
She's a leather goddess minister  
Who works with the confined  
It don't take much to realize  
That all this stuff takes time

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
T'was grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
Oh how precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see  
  
Shall I be wafted to the skies  
On flowery beds of ease  
While others strive to win the prize  
And sail on bloody seas  
  
Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost but now am found  
Was blind but now I see

You get a hammer and I'll get a nail  
And you catch a bird and I'll catch a snail  
You bring a board and I'll bring a saw  
And we'll build a house for the baby-o  
CHORUS  
Bling, Blang, hammer with my hammer  
Zingo, Zango, cutting with my saw  
Bling, Blang, hammer with my hammer  
Zingo, Zango, cutting with my saw  
I'll grab some mud and you grab some clay  
So when it rains it won't wash away  
We'll build a house that'll be so strong  
The winds will sing my baby a song  
CHORUS  
Run bring rocks and I'll bring bricks  
A nice pretty house we'll build and fix  
We'll jump inside when the cold wind blows  
And kiss our little baby-o  
CHORUS  
You bring a ladder and I'll get a box  
Build our house of bricks and blocks  
When the snowbird flies and the honeybee comes  
We'll feed our baby on honey in the comb  
CHORUS  
  

As I was walking down the street  
Down the street, down the street  
A pretty girl I chanced to meet  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And he knees was a knockin' and her shoes was a rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And her knees was a knockin' and her shoes was a rockin'  
I danced with a gal with a hole in her stocking  
And we danced by the light of the moon  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
Come out tonight come out tonight  
Buffalo gals won't you come out tonight  
And we'll dance by the light of the moon  

There's a tavern up on the roadside, I must be coming into town  
The moon must be in Aries, because the truck ain't slowing down  
Pulled back on the throttle, I've been doing that all day  
Looking ahead for a right-hand turn to carry me away  
There's times for understanding, it don't seem like one of those  
The times are too demanding when you're hanging by your nose  
So why don't you just get out of here and leave me here to pray?  
That one of these mornings the sun's going to rise and carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That I'm feeling here tonight  
You know I'm feeling just like a riptide and I'm feeling a little scared  
A twisted maze of old highways, nobody has repaired  
It ain't nothing that can't be handled like an actor in a play  
Who becomes enraged, jumps from the stage and gets a little carried away  
Now all of your highways, don't mean much to me no more  
I've been on all of your highway roads of that you can be sure  
But I still get lost on all of them roads, I can't seems to find my way  
I know there's one out there somewhere to carry me away  
Carry me over the highway  
Carry me over the sky  
Carry me over the loneliness  
That I'm feeling here tonight  

Warm me from the wind and take my haand  
A song is sounding, softly singing  
My song is cast upon the rainbow waves  
Forever splashing in the sunlight  
Prove to me there's a love still left  
In all of this emptiness around me  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
Though you know my love that I must go  
A-following the winds that blow inside me  
I've nowhere left to run or hide  
Except if you will come and run beside me  
And even if you do there'll be a lot for us to do  
To keep believing  
Take me from the chilling of the evening  
  
And now my time has come down many streets  
I'm coming from a night decaying  
The song that itself sings is all alone  
I cannot even hear it playing  
Now to leave before I understand  
Just what it is I'm leaving  
Take me from the chilling of the evening

Chorus:  
All my life's a circle  
Sunrise and sundown  
Moon rolls through the nighttime  
Till daybreak comes around  
All my life's a circle  
Still I wonder why  
Seasons spinning 'round again  
Years keep rolling by  
  
Seems like I've been here before  
Can't remember when  
I got this funny feeling  
We'll all be together again  
No straight lines make up my life  
All my roads have bends  
No clear cut beginnings  
So far no dead ends  
  
Chorus  
  
I've met you a thousand times  
I guess you've done the same  
Then we lose each other  
It's like a children's game  
But now I find you here again  
The thought comes to my mind  
Our love is like a circle  
Let's go 'round one more time  
  
Chorus  
  

Everything seems to be going in the wrong direction  
The doctor wants to give me more injections  
He's given me shots for a thousand rare infections  
And they don't know if they'll Iet me go  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Connection  
No I just can't make no connection  
And all I want to do  
Is just to get back to you  
  
My bags they get a very close inspection  
I wonder why it is that they suspect 'em  
They're just tryin' to add me to their collection  
And I don't know if they'll let me go  
  
[CHORUS]

Hey brothers, hear me call  
It ain't that I had to fall  
Wasn't no one's fault last night  
When I looked up and felt the light  
  
Here's hoping you'll understand  
I want to fell like a natural man  
Get up early in the morning to do what I can  
You can't help no one with money  
If you can't with your hands  
  
And you got to be there brothers, yes you do  
If the world is turning under you  
Ain't no good to sit around  
And bring it up or down  
You got to be there brothers, yes you do  
  
Hey brothers, now and then  
There's something that oughta move you  
More than a pen  
You don't need no school or knowledge  
You've got something else to lend  
And all the people in the world  
Can make it better again  
  
And it ain't easy, yes I know  
It's a hard and rugged road  
Don't be swindled, don't be fooled  
Just be honest and stay cool  
  
'Cause you got to be there brothers, yes you do  
If the world is turning under you  
Ain't no good to sit around  
And bring it up or down  
You got to be there brothers, yes you do

Days are short, and I ain't down  
The sun is on the hill  
Looking in my suitcase for a friend  
The door was opened wide  
You know I lost a little pride  
And inside it was just another man  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Every day another man reaches out his hand  
Every moment there's a shifting in the sand  
Every whisper in the wind  
Brings a good man back again  
Settle me down in my dreams tonight  
Tomorrow's another day to blow my blues away  
  
Lots of folks will tell you that  
A man can go through' life  
Taking what he wants along the way  
But until all men are freed  
Each one gets but what he needs  
The experience of living every day  
  
[CHORUS:]  
  
I woke up this morning  
I awoke upon my knees  
Crying oo-wee, I don't know where I am  
I feel just like a clown  
Every time I move around  
Because, after all, I'm just another man

The crops are all in and the peaches are rotting  
The oranges are piled in their cresote dumps  
They're flying you back to the Mexico border  
To pay all your money to wade back again  
  
My father's own father, he wanted that river  
They took all the money he made in his life  
My brothers and sisters come working the fruit trees  
And they rode the truck till they took down and died  
  
Good-bye to my Juan, good-bye Rosalita  
Adios mis amigos, Jesus why Maris  
You won't have a name when you ride the big air-plane  
And all they will call you will be deportees.  
  
Some of us are illega, and others not wanted  
Our work contract's out and we have to move on  
But it's six hundred miles to that Mexican border  
They chase us like outlaws, like rustlers, like theives.  
  
We died in your hills, we died in your deserts  
We died in your valleys and died on your plains  
We died 'neath your trees and we died in your bushes  
Both sides of the river, we died just the same.  
  
Good-bye to my Juan, good-bye Rosalita  
Adios mis amigos, Jesus why Maris  
You won't have a name when you ride the big air-plane  
And all they will call you will be deportees.  
  
A sky plane caught fire over Los Gatos canyon  
Like a fireball of lightning, it shook all our hills  
Who are all these friends, all scattered like dry leaves?  
The radio says they are just deportees.  
  
Is this the best way we can grow our big orchards?  
Is this the best way we can grow our good fruit?  
To fall like dry leaves to rot on my topsoil  
And be called by no name except deportees?

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Where would all the angels go  
Would they just fly around forever  
Or would they come down here below  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light  
If all the doors were close in heaven  
They'd have to close the road to hell  
We'd all be stuck here with each other  
There would be nowhere else to dwell  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And everyone there had to leave  
And death was nothing but a moment  
Beyond the breaths you took to breathe  
If all the doors were closed in heaven  
Who would dare abuse a child  
Or let a little kid go hungry  
Or not return a simple smile  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
And the host of heaven was on the street  
I wonder if they'd look much different  
From the likes of you and me  
So I hope they close the doors to heaven  
And all the angels up above  
Come and build a home among us  
Remind us what it is to love  
If the pearly gates were closed this morning  
Would there be angels here tonight  
And would they live their lives among us  
And share the darkness with their light

Sitting down on a country fence post  
Sitting down watchin' trucks roll by  
Sitting down under the light of day now  
You know that I won't tell you no lies  
  
I've been here for an hour or so  
And nothing much is going down  
I don't care much anyway  
Because you know I've been around  
  
Here on the edge of the green fields growing  
And the sunlight warming all around  
And the blowing of the early mist in the morning  
You know that I don't hear a sound  
  
Till once in a while, when a truck rolls by,  
Carrying a overload  
I don't wanna go nowhere right now  
I feel like my future sold  
  
Stand on the good land children  
You know that it won't do you in  
I must have been here one time before  
But I wonder where the hell I've been  
  
Early in the morning when the sun comes up  
And I'm walkin' all around the field  
Thinkin' to myself about the city life scenes  
And man you know they ain't for real  
  
All you got to do is stick your foot in your mouth  
And tell it where you want to go  
End up talkin' to yourself some time  
Alone along a country road  
  
Stand on the good land children  
I feel like I'm bound to stay  
And do the same this morning  
Like I went and did yesterday  
  
Stand on the good land children  
You know that it won't do you in  
I must have been here one time before  
But I wonder where the hell I've been

By Steve and Carol Ide  
Let's not sit here, talk about it baby  
It's got to start in your heart or else it'll pass on by  
It's what pleases you when your love seems new  
That puts the light back in your eyes  
You got what it takes, and I know it make it through  
CHORUS:  
You've got to give it all that you got  
Honey that's the thing to do  
You've got to give it your best shot  
Even when the world's closing' in on you  
It's not an easy life we're livin'  
But in the end if it's love you're givin'  
Don't be afraid, don't give it up  
Give it all you got  
There's people around who are standin' right by your side  
Walkin' hand in hand, they could follow you up to the sky  
But if you leave 'em alone, they'll be on their own  
And then there'll be reason to try,  
What's the use payin' dues when you got no reason why  
CHORUS  
What do you do when there's so much in you  
You can't feel the road that you're on  
Say what needs to be said, get it all out your head  
And you're back on the road before long  
CHORUS  
  

I went down to the grocery store  
To get in I had to pay a dime or more  
I hadn't yet begun to start  
When I had to pay the rent on the shopping cart  
Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
Well I let the kids loose on the floor  
And they ran round for a while or more  
Till the manager with the broken smile  
Said it's a dollar down and a quarter an aisle  
Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
I was down in the freezer upon my knees  
Somebody was yelling that the price got freezed  
There was a rioting mob, a strangling hold  
I received the bill for the escaping cold  
Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
It was about this time that I was goin' insane  
I went and picked the kids up in the other lane  
Put back the food and ran out of the store  
I ain't goin' back to that place no more  
Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  
Well I'm tellin the truth now, I don't fib  
I don't mind no women's lib  
But if my woman don't want to go down to the store  
The family ain't gonna eat no more  
Deedle lee dumb, deedle lee dumb  
Deedle lee dumb de dumb dumb  

The words mean, I am a truthful man  
From the land of the palm trees  
And before dying, I want to share the poems of my soul  
My poems are soft green,  
My poems are also flaming crimson  
My poems are like a wounded fawn  
Seeking refuge in the forest  
The last verse says "con los pobres de la tierra"  
With the poor people of this earth  
I want to share my fate  
The streams of the mountain  
Pleases me more than the sea

It was late last night when the boss came home  
Asking about his lady  
The only answer that he got was  
She's gone with the Gypsy Davey  
Gone with the Gypsy Dave  
  
Go saddle me up my buckskin home  
And my hundred dollar saddle  
Point out to me their wagon tracks  
And after them I'll travel and after them l'll ride  
  
Well I had not rode 'till the midnight moon  
I saw their campfire gleaming  
I heard the notes of the big guitar  
And the voice of the Gypsies singing  
That song of the Gypsy Dave  
  
It was there in the light of the camping fire  
I saw her fair face beaming  
Her heart in tune to the big guitar  
And the song of the gypsies singing  
That song of the Gypsy Dave  
  
Have you forsaken your house and home?  
Have you forsaken your baby?  
Have you forsaken your husband dear?  
To go with the Gypsy Davey  
And sing with the Gypsy Davey  
The song of the Gypsy Dave?  
  
Yes I've forsaken my husband dear  
To go with the Gypsy Davey  
And I've forsaken my mansion high  
But not my blue eyed baby  
Not my blue eyed babe  
  
She smiled to leave her husband dear  
To go with the Gypsy Davey  
But the tears come a-trickling down her cheeks  
To think about her blue eyed baby  
To think about her blue eyed babe  
  
Take off take off those buckskin gloves  
Made of Spanish leather  
Come give to me your lily-white hand  
And we'll ride home together  
And home again we'll ride  
  
No I won't take off my buckskin gloves  
Made of Spanish leather  
I'll go my way from day to day  
And sing with the Gypsy Davey  
The song of the Gypsy Davey  
The song of the Gypsy Dave

I ain't got a nickel to call mine  
The government has made me pay my tax on time  
They've taken all my bread and left me here for dead  
I ain't even got a lousy dime  
  
Who the hell wants money  
When there ain't none to be had  
It don't make the good times better  
It don't make the bad times bad  
  
Well, you find out who your friends are  
When you ain't got a dime  
Just trying to make the best of these hard times  
  
I've got fifteen cars and I can't afford the gas  
We've got a horse but how long can she last  
My managers enraged, my banker stands there days  
Funny how the money goes so fast  
  
Who the hell wants money  
When there ain't none to be had  
It don't make the good times better  
It don't make the bad times bad  
  
Well, you find out who your friends are  
When you ain't got a dime  
Just trying to make the best of these hard times  
  
We are broke but we've been broke before  
But being broke don't scare us anymore  
My daddy's broke and grandpa too  
But I'm still here to sing for you  
We are going to make it through for sure  
  
Well, you find out who your friends are  
When you ain't got a dime  
Just trying to make the best of these hard times

Sail with me into the unknown void  
That has no end  
Swept along the open road  
That don't seem to begin  
Come with me a love me, Babe  
I may be back again  
Meantime I'll keep sailing down  
This highway in the wind  
  
Evenings just begin the days  
And follows with the night  
To love you and to be with you  
And say that it's all right  
Love me while you have me, Babe  
I may be back again  
Meantime I'll keep sailing down  
This highway in the wind  
  
There's times I feel like going  
And there's times I want to stay  
Times that I ain't feeling well  
And times I feel ok  
Now you have time to love me, Babe  
And I may have time agian  
Meantime I'll keep sailing down  
This highway in the wind  
  
The fortune teller tells me  
I have somewhere to go  
I look and try to understand  
And wonder how she knows  
So I must be going now  
I'm losing time my friend  
Looking for a rainbow  
Down this highway in the wind

[Chorus:]  
I could be singing forever  
I guess you could say I'm in love  
The universe is getting together  
You know that I can't say it enough  
You and your friends have a party  
Welcome your heavenly dad  
  
Remember the guy by the water  
We seen walkin' 'round on the air  
He went and learned for a quarter  
He knew that you could see him there  
You take your friends to the ocean  
Walk on the sand if you can  
  
Spiro stepped out on the door step  
He spoke like he had something to say  
He said, "I don't want to hear anybody."  
I guess he's going to be that way  
  
Even all the elephants hear you, Spiro  
Would you believe it at last?  
Nobody wants to be near you  
The new world is coming that fast  
  
They're beating on you in Chicago  
They're picking you up on the coast  
They're knocking you off in Ohio  
They like sending you to war the most  
  
When will you get it together?  
Everybody in this land  
Helping out your brothers and sisters  
Everyone must understand  
  
[Chorus]

Remember back when I was born  
High up in the sky  
Looking down upon the scene  
I can't recall just why  
A white love light come up to me  
I followed it back down  
Sayin' this is the tune of the Earth, my friends  
When I want to be around  
  
I want to be around  
When the stars fall on the ground  
Walking hand in hand with every man  
Sleeping in the sun with everyone  
  
Abraham, come in one more time  
It must have been in L.A.  
He just said, "Joe, won't you stay?"  
"All right, okay," he said to me  
"I got nothing else to do."  
So Abe walked in, he's back again  
Until his life is through  
  
He's going to be around  
While a whole new world goes down  
Walking hand in hand with every man  
Sleeping in the sun with everyone  
  
Every night by morning light  
I look up on the hill  
Digging all the cosmic sights  
And I recognize it's Will  
I said, "Oh well, it's getting time  
I'm beginning to feel my load."  
  
He said, "Don't worry, brother  
'Cause you and the others  
Will see it out on the road."  
  
And I want to be around  
When all over this world  
You can't hear a sound 'cept everyone  
Singing songs of glory in the sun

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Friends I used to know are coming by  
To ask me if my situation's high  
'Cause sometimes I just stare at the sky  
Up is down before Her crown I cry  
CHORUS:  
If you would just drop by sometime  
If you would just drop by  
If you can possible make it up sometime  
I can be there if I try  
The world world keeps spinnin' me 'round  
Bringing me up and bringing me down  
But I can't get there with my feet on the ground  
Maybe I oughta start digging a hole around my feet on the ground  
CHORUS  
You know once in while as I sit and stare  
I get the feeling that there's no one there  
Look at me now as I roll off my chair  
How did I know that a chair could be out where I stare?  
CHORUS  
  

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
It's okay if you're all right  
It's good to be here with you tonight  
Dressed in moonlight and faded jeans  
It ain't no mystery, all it means is  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
We'll be all right if it's ok  
I know I'm crazy but I'm naturally that way  
And by the look in your liquid eyes  
It won't come as any big suprise but  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
Everybody's in their own little world  
And I've been dreaming about you girl  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
I'm here with you, you're here with me  
Ain't it wonderful just how good it can be  
I don't imagine it gets much better than this  
But whatever it was it just got crossed off my list  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
Can't believe I'll be with you tonight  
  
Everybody's in their own little world  
And I've been dreaming about you girl  
I can't believe I'll be with you tonight

By Tom Paxton  
Oh the price of gold is rising out of sight  
And the dollar is in sorry shape tonight  
What the dollar used to get us now won't buy a head of lettuce  
No the economic forecast isn't right  
But amidst the clouds I spot a shining ray  
I can even glimpse a new and better way  
And I've devised a plan of action worked it down to the last fraction  
And I'm going into action here today  
CHORUS:  
I am changing my name to Chrysler  
I am going down to Washington D.C.  
I will tell some power broker  
What they did for Iacocca  
Will be perfectly acceptable to me  
I am changing my name to Chrysler  
I am headed for that great receiving line  
So when they hand a million grand out  
I'll be standing with my hand out  
Yes sire I'll get mine  
When my creditors are screaming for their dough  
I'll be proud to tell them all where they can all go  
They won't have to scream and holler  
They'll be paid to the last dollar  
Where the endless streams of money seem to flow  
I'll be glad to tell them what they can do  
It's a matter of a simple form or two  
It's not just renumeration it's a liberal education  
Ain't you kind of glad that I'm in debt to you  
CHORUS  
Since the first amphibians crawled out of the slime  
We've been struggling in an unrelenting climb  
We were hardly up and walking before money started talking  
And it's sad that failure is an awful crime  
Well it's been that way for a millennium or two  
But now it seems that there's a different point of view  
If you're a corporate titanic and your failure is gigantic  
Down to congress there's a safety net for you  
CHORUS  
  

Like the tree that grows so tall  
Leaves turn gold and then they fall  
They've gone down, now they've grown  
They're going home  
  
Mountain streams may run and flow  
Clean the sands on which they go  
Stretching down like it had known  
It's going home  
  
Sunrise early in the dawn  
Slips away, then it's gone  
Leaves the night to carry on  
While it's going home  
  
Once a man he lived and died  
What he said death could not hide  
Even though it's often tried  
But he was going home  
  
Now my friends it's time to go  
And this love will live to grow  
And I want you all to know  
I'm going home

I've just seen a face,  
I can't forget the time or place  
That we'd just met, she's just the girl for me  
And I want all the world to see we've met  
Na na na na na na  
  
Had it been another day  
I might have looked the other way  
But I had never been aware  
And as it is I dream of her tonight  
Na na na na na na  
  
[CHORUS:]  
Falling, yes I am falling  
And she keeps calling me back again  
  
I have never known  
The likes of this, I've been alone  
And I have missed things and kept out of sight  
But other girls were never quite like this  
Na na na na na na  
  
[CHORUS]  
I've just seen a face  
I can t forget the time or place  
And we'd just met, she's just the girl for me  
And I want all the world to see we've met  
Na na na na na na  
  
[CHORUS]

[Chorus]  
I don't need no diamond ring  
I don't need no Cadillac car  
Just want to drink my Ripple wine  
Down in the Lightnin' Bar  
Down in the Lightnin' Bar  
  
Some people value fortune and fame  
I don't care about 'em none  
Just want to drink my Ripple wine  
I want to have my good time fun  
Have my good time fun  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When I die don't cry for me  
Don't bury me at all  
Place my livin', laughin', lovin' bones  
In a jar of alcohol  
Hundred proof alcohol

I am a little Beggar and a Beggar I have been  
For three score'are more in this little Isle of green  
And I'm known from the Liffy down to Segue  
And I'm known by the name of bold Donahue  
  
Of all the trades a-goin' now sure beggin is the best  
When a man gets tired he can lay him down to rest  
He can beg for his dinner when there's nothing left to do  
Then just cut around the corner with his old Rigadoo  
  
I slept in a barn way down in Curabawn  
A-waitin' in for the mornin' I slept till the dawn  
With the holes in the roof and the rain a-comin' through  
And the cats and the rats they were playin' peeka-boo  
  
Who should awaken but the woman of the house  
With here white spotted apron and her calico blouse  
She began to frighten when I said boo!  
Sayin' don't be afraid ma'am it's old Johnny Dhu.  
  
I met a little flaxy haired girl one day,  
Good morning little flaxy haired girl I say  
Good morning little Beggar Man and how do you do  
With your rags and your tags and your old Rigaioo  
  
Buy a pair of leggings and a collar and a be  
And a nice big lady I will fetch by and by  
Buy a pair of goggles and I'll color them blue  
And an old fashioned lady I will make her too  
  
Over the fields with the pack on my back  
Over the field with my great heavy sack  
With the holes in my shoes and the toes a'peekin' through  
Singin' skittilee rink-a-doodle it's the old Johnny Dhu  
  
Must be going to bed boys, it's gettin' late at night  
All the fire's all raked and up goes the light  
And now you've heard the story of my old Rigadoo  
It's "Good-bye God be with you' sings the old Johnny Dhu.

Me and my goose  
Me and my pal  
We had some very good times  
Me and my goose his name was Al  
And he cost only a dime  
  
Over meadows we'd stray  
Playing all day  
I missed him at night until dawn  
Then one day I found he wasn't around  
I wondered where Al could have gone  
  
I looked everywhere he just wasn't there  
Where could a goose be all day  
I miss my pal  
I miss my Al  
It's sad that things turned out this way  
  
Then mom brought him  
I remember her grin  
Stuffed with his feet pointed straight  
  
I'll never forget the night that we ate  
Al off of the old yellow plate

Loving in golden temples, my love  
Is flowing on heavenly seas  
The silent commands and heard throughout the lands  
And are weaving his patterns with ease  
  
All of the beautiful mountains beyond  
Can surely not tempt me to stay  
Even my musical melody thoughts  
Are memories in yesterday  
  
Wave upon wave of life within me  
Give me the strength to go on  
Wave after wave of love all around me  
Give me the time to catch on  
  
Wave upon wave of life within me  
Give me the strength to go on  
Wave after wave of love all around me  
Give me the time to catch on  
  
[Repeat all]

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
  
Beneath this balcony of stars  
Beyond the searchlight stage where we've become  
The stuff of time amid the waves  
Whose nets are cast along the shore when day is done  
  
As the seabird flies aboce  
My songs are sung to those I've come to love  
The petals strung into the leis  
The flowering of days I've just begun  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Beneath the last rays setting of the sun  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
When gods and goddesses decreed  
The mountains raised up from beneath the seas  
The sound of sovereign thrones  
Above the hand tied bureaucrat who moans  
  
This crazy love amazes me  
As I just gaze into your eyes  
The liquid sun is split upon the sea  
I want to be where I can see the moon arise  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Before the moment fades to summarize  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am  
  
Along the lonely stretch of sand  
Reduced to just a woman and a man  
Bathed in the lunar light  
The likes of which I might just understand  
  
Among the myths I know are real  
The goddess disguised as herself revealed  
I sang her song out loud  
She sat herself beside me in the crowd  
  
A second chance to grasp a dance  
Into the moment that she would allow  
Tears along the trail of sand  
Footprints in the water lead me back to who I am

My love, you're like the wind on the run  
I never know where you are coming from  
I wasn't easily won  
My love I saw you first long ago  
I didn't think then, now I know  
How long it took love to grow  
Oh babe, I long to hold you at night  
We two together are so right  
You make the darkness so bright  
My love, we've had one hell of a time  
And we've got over our crying  
And we've come out of this fine  
Because when two loves grow old  
There can be no denying  
That their love may soon grow colder  
Yet that's when we started trying  
Oh babe, this love we have must be for real  
We've overcome, now it's sealed  
I know if something you feel  
My love, you're like the wind on the run  
I didn't know where you were coming from  
I wasn't easily won  

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Looked into your eyes this morning  
You were far away  
You must have known I was looking for you  
You knew you couldn't stay  
All these winds blowin' on me  
Blowing in the nighttime lonely  
Blew on over the ocean to you  
Blew my words away  
Put on your heavenly shoes babe  
Walk around the clouds  
You know that's where I'm bound to be now  
I'm coming with the crowds  
All these faces looking at me  
Looking through me I don't mind  
I just seen your face a-worrying  
I loved you when you cried  
Take my hand across the water  
You won't leave no tracks behind  
Step all over the moon lit ocean  
It's only in your mind  
All these thoughts just rip me  
Who can heal a heart that's broken  
Like the winds that blow unspoken  
Blow my love away  
  

Oh, in the morning  
Feel like the sun  
Coming up on daytime  
Shine on every one  
Coming up on darkness  
Warm me in your arms  
Let me know another lonely night  
Has come and gone  
  
Oh, happy river flowing  
Gently unto me  
Softly bring me music  
Listen to you sing  
Swiftly running river flowing  
We'll at last be free  
Oh, happy waterwheel  
Roll gently over me  
  
Oh in the evening  
Feel alone at last  
All of the things that the daytime brings  
Roll gently in the past  
There is nothing left to see  
Except the stars and moon  
To let me know another lonely day  
Is coming soon  
  
Oh, in the morning  
Feel like the sun  
Coming up on daytime  
Shine on everyone  
Coming up on darkness  
Warm me in your arms  
Let me know another lonely night  
Has come and gone

You said you didn't know  
That the cats with the birds were there  
And you never go along with that kind of stuff no where  
But that just isn't the point man  
That's the wrong wrong way to go  
If you didn't know about that one, well then what else don't you know  
You said that you were lied to  
Well that ain't hard too see  
But you must have been fooled again by your friends across the sea  
And maybe you were fooled again by your people here at home  
Because nobody could talk like you  
And know what's going on  
Nobody elected your family  
And we didn't elect your friends  
No one voted for your advisers  
And nobody wants the men  
You're the one we voted for, so you must take the blame  
For handing out authority to men who were insane  
You say its all fixed up now, you've got new guys on the line  
But you had better remember this while you still got the time  
Mothers still are weeping for their boys that went to war  
Father still are asking what the whole damn thing was for  
And People still are hungry and people still are poor  
And on this week of work these days don't feed the kids no more  
Schools are still like prison  
'Cause we don't learn how to live  
And everybody wants to take, nobody wants to give  
Yes you will be remembered, be remembered very well  
And if I live a long life, all the stories I could tell  
A mans who falls in poverty of sickness and of grief  
Hell yes  
You will be remembered, be remembered very well  
You said you didn't know  
That the that the cats with the birds were there  
You'd never go along with that kind of stuff no where  
But that just isn't the point man  
That's the wrong ,wrong way to go  
You did

By Woody Guthrie  
Ramblin' around your city  
Ramblin' around your town  
I never see a friend I know  
As I go ramblin' 'round boys  
As I go ramblin' 'round  
My mother hoped that I might be  
A man of some renown  
But I am just a refugee  
As I go ramblin' 'round boys  
As I go ramblin' 'round  
The peach trees they are loaded  
The branches bending down  
I pick 'em all day for a dollar boys  
As I go 'ramblin 'round  
As I go 'ramblin' 'round  
Sometimes the fruit gets rotten  
And falls on to the ground  
There's a hungry mouth for every peach  
As I go ramblin' 'round boys  
As I go ramblin' 'round  
  

From this valley they say you are going  
We will miss your bright eyes and sweet smile  
For they say you are taking the sunshine  
That has brightened our pathways awhile  
  
[Chorus]  
Come and sit by my side, if you love me  
Do not hasten to bid me adieu  
Just remember the Red River Valley  
And the cowboy who loved you so true  
  
I've been thinking a long time, my darling  
Of the sweet words you never would say  
Now, alas, must my fond hopes all vanish  
For they say you are going away  
  
Do you think of the valley you're leaving  
O how lonely and how dreary it will be  
And do you think of the kind hearts you're breaking  
And the pain you are causing to me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They will bury me where you have wandered  
Near the hills where the daffodils grow  
When you're gone from the Red River Valley  
For I can't live without you I know  
  
[Chorus]

Had a friend, a friend I could trust  
He went into the park and got busted  
Doing the ring-a-round-a-rosy rag  
Went in the park late at night  
And he put a lot of people over eighty up tight  
He was doing the ring-a-round-a-rosy rag  
  
Ring around, ring around rose  
Touch your nose and blow your toes and mind  
Doing the ring-around-a-rosy rag  
(It really was a drag)  
Ring around, ring-around-a-rose  
Touch your nose and blow your toes and mind  
Doing the ring-around-a-rosy rag  
  
We ought to send Officer Joe Strange  
To some Australian mountain range  
So we all can do the ring-around-a-rosy rag  
Would you like to put Philadelphia up tight  
One mass ring-around-a-rosy  
In the middle of the night?  
We all should do the ring-around-a-rosy rag

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Running down the road  
Make my get away  
Everything I told you  
Was just yesterday  
Yes, You know I'm off again  
Oh, and I've been told  
You were there beside me  
Running down the road  
Walking down the street  
Meet me down the line  
Police car at my feet  
They were there on time  
Everybody's looking for  
Something to explode  
How can you afford the time  
Running down the road  
My feet are getting tired  
My head begins to spin  
Who of us is dreaming  
You or me or him?  
Yes, You know I'm waiting  
While these times unfold  
Looking backward briefly  
Running down the road  
(Repeat first verse)  
  

Too many women growing up wrong  
Get an education, thinking thoughts on their own  
Making decisions, telling men what to do  
Look at the trouble that we're all going through  
Russian girls could save the world  
Here in America, land of the free  
Used to mean something to you and to me  
You can't tell women what they really are for  
Well, then you ain't really free anymore  
Russian girls could save the world  
Meanwhile back in the U.S.S.R.  
They're making women change tires on cars  
Working in factories and incredible as it seems  
They make them study gymnastics  
And you know what that means  
Russian girls could save the world  

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
There's a river running underground  
That roll along the clay  
That took my body when I laid it down  
And carried it far away  
It's too damned dark for you to see  
So I did not protest  
My soul shook free, you can't have me  
But you may keep the rest  
The waters weep, the sickles reap  
My hands are cold with sweat  
The eagle screams with frightened wings  
The dust does not forget  
There's a river running underground  
That rolls along the clay  
That tempts the sould to the ocean cold  
To with the body lay

I went down in the valley to pray  
Learnin' about the good old way  
And who would wear the starry crown  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh Brother, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh Brother, lets go down  
Down in the valley to pray  
As I went walkin in the valley to pray  
Learnin' about the good old way  
And who would wear the starry crown  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh Father, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh Father, lets go down  
Down in the valley to pray  
I went out walkin' on the mountain to pray  
Learnin' about the good old way  
I went up on the mountain and I just had to say  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh Sister, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh Sister, lets go down  
Down in the valley to pray  
As I went down in the valley to pray  
Studyin' about the good old way  
And who will wear the starry crown  
Oh Lord, show me the way  
Oh, let's go down  
Come on down, don't you want to go down  
Oh, let's go down  
Down in the valley to pray  
  

Wind's gonna blow, so I'm gonna go  
Down on the road again  
Starting where the mountains left me  
I'm up where I began  
Where I will go, the wind only knows  
Good times around the bend  
Get in my car, goin' too far  
Never comin' back again  
Tired and worn, I woke up this mornin'  
Found that I was confused  
Spun right around and found I had lost  
The things that I couldn't lose  
The beaches they sell to build their hotels  
My father's and I once knew  
Birds all along sunlight at dawn  
Singing Waimanalo blues  
Down on the road with mountains so old  
Far on the country side  
Birds on the wing forget in a while  
So I'm headed for the windward side  
All of your dreams, sometimes it just seems  
That I'm just along for the ride  
Some they will cry because they have pride  
For someone who's loved here died  
The beaches they sell to build their hotels  
My father's and I once knew  
Birds all along sunlight at dawn  
Singing Waimanalo blues  

When I was younger she'd come to me in dreams  
Her face was hidden in the mountain streams  
Her voice disguised as the sound of the wind  
The rustling of leaves, she would call from within  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
So many memories of those years have passed  
Beyond the confusion, that thought would last forever  
The countless veils that I wore like clothes  
Have been stripped away, now stand here exposed  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
In the night when the moon casts no shadows at all  
We sat by the fire as she started to call  
Out to all who would hear that the death of what's dead  
Is the birth of what's living and her words filled my head  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  
It's the life that lies sleeping when you think you're awake  
Forever is real and the rest is just fake  
And though volumes are written on this subject alone  
She used three simple words and she brought it all home  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, she said  
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wake up dead  

Words and music by Leah Kunkel  
Oh, last night I sat by your side  
Oh, I was feelin' so lonely  
Would have given up my pride  
All night I was so lonely  
Then you took to the streets  
You don't have much to say  
But I listened to your feet  
As they walked away  
Bye bye bye bye  
Now walking's the only thing I know  
Oh we do well together  
I ain't thinkin' 'bout where we go  
Lace up your boots of leather  
Then we take to the streets  
We don't have much to say  
But I listen to our feet  
As we walk away  
Bye bye bye...  
I wasn't lookin' for love  
I'm a little sorry you're gore  
But until we have something to say  
L'll just keep walking along  
Bye bye bye...  
Ask me if I need you now  
Oh no I'm feeling great  
If you hunt me in my dreams  
Ah there is one escape  
I'll just take to the streets  
I won't have much to say  
But I'll be listening to my feet  
As they walk away  
Bye bye bye...  
  

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
Poor Adam alone in Eden  
Taking off his shoes  
Tired of running around all morning  
From his animal interviews  
He awoke with a hand on his brow  
Askign who are you  
They spent the rest of their lives together  
Making their debuts  
Dressed in leaves and wearing blues  
Some say one thing, some say two  
Ain't much about it anyone can do  
Keep on walking till my soles wear through  
Wearing away my shoes  
Evening comes and the sky turns red  
Clouds of colors cover up our heads  
Ain't it something just to lie here in bed  
Just me and you  
Oh Mary, wrapped up in glory  
What are you going to tell your groom  
How's he going to feel on the day of your wedding  
What will your friends assume  
Oh, but Joseph and Mary were married  
The angels carried the news  
What the Lord has joined together  
The world must not undo  
Thene's a wedding down at the church this morning  
Let's uo wish them well  
It's a beautiful day for getting married  
I hope the weather lasts as well  
It's been years since we've been married  
I know we paid some dues  
Now ain't it something just to lie here together  
Just me and you  
Outlasting the blues  
  

By Richard Thompson  
Greedy people take what's mine  
I can leave them all behind  
And they can never cross that line  
When I get to the border  
Saw-bones standin' at the door  
Waiting till I hit the floor  
He won't find me anymore  
When I get to the border  
CHORUS:  
Monday morning, Monday morning  
Closing in on me  
I'm packin' up and I'm a-runnin' away  
To where nobody thinks of me  
If you see a box of pine  
With a name that looks like mine  
Say I drowned in a barrel of wine  
When I got to the border  
When I got to the border  
CHORUS  
A one way ticket's in my hand  
Headed for the chosen land  
My troubles will all turn to sand  
When I get to the border  
A soft girl with yellow hair  
Waiting in that rockin' chair  
And if I'm weary I won't care  
When I get to the border  
CHORUS  
A dusty road that smells so sweet  
Paved with gold beneath my feet  
And I'll be dancing down the street  
When I get to the border  
When I get to the border  
CHORUS

Where have all the flowers gone?  
Long time passing  
Where have all the flowers gone?  
Long time ago  
Where have all the flowers gone?  
Girls have picked them every one  
When will they ever learn?  
When will they ever learn?  
  
Where have all the young girls gone?  
Long time passing  
Where have all the young girls gone?  
Long time ago  
Where have all the young girls gone?  
Taken husbands every one  
When will they ever learn?  
When will they ever learn?  
  
Where have all the young men gone?  
Long time passing  
Where have all the young men gone?  
Long time ago  
Where have all the young men gone?  
Gone for soldiers every one  
When will they ever learn?  
When will they ever learn?  
  
Where have all the soldiers gone?  
Long time passing  
Where have all the soldiers gone?  
Long time ago  
Where have all the soldiers gone?  
Gone to graveyards every one  
When will they ever learn?  
When will they ever learn?  
  
Where have all the graveyards gone?  
Long time passing  
Where have all the graveyards gone?  
Long time ago  
Where have all the graveyards gone?  
Covered with flowers every one  
When will we ever learn?  
When will we ever learn?

Words and music by Arlo Guthrie  
There's trouble all around the world  
Well, it looks that way to me  
People don't know what to do  
They don't know where they should be  
But just one question still remains  
To which we must respond  
Two roads lead from where we are  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS:  
Are you on, boys  
Which side are you on  
Which side are you on, boys  
Which side are you on  
Moses crossed the desert  
With a band of weary men  
For forty years they wandered through  
The hot and burning sand  
And Moses went and prayed alone  
The weary vagabond  
And lightning wrote these words in stone  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS  
Jesus stumbling through the streets  
On the road to Calvary  
Nailed high to testify  
With other local thieves  
And as they hung there dying  
One asked what lay beyond  
That all depends the master said  
Which side are you on  
CHORUS  
Some men work for little things  
And some men work for more  
Some men work for anything  
And some don't work at all  
And me myself I'm satisfied  
To sing for God's own son  
And ask you what I ask myself  
Which side are you on  
  

Not so long ago I set out on this road  
With my friends and my companions by my side  
And I think of you wherever I do go  
I'm a rambler, I ain't hard to satisfy  
  
[Chorus:]  
Won't be long till I am home again with you  
Just a few more miles to go  
Won't be long till I can get back on my own  
Won't be long till I can spend my time with you  
  
In the airport I'm standing in a line  
Search my pockets, check me out and I'm alright  
It's not hard but it ain't easy all the time  
To be in some other town most every night  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Oh, I miss the singing from porch banjo nights  
And when friends come by to pass the time away  
And when the winds that chill the Bershires in the night  
Heading east through Massachusetts toward the bay

I've been keeping on the run  
I've been traveling with the sun  
I've been singing all my life and getting by  
Got to keep up with what's going on  
In this place I've been so long  
And I guess I'll just keep singing all my life  
And it's so good to come home  
To a woman all alone  
Forgetting how sad loneliness can be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
I'll be coming home at night  
While the kids are sleeping tight  
She'll be lit by firelight and looking fine  
And the kids jump out of bed  
Hello Daddy, what did you get  
Did you think of anything on down the line  
She'll be talking with her smile  
Saying, honey, wait awhile  
The kids have missed you, soon they'll be asleep  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  
Oh the prophets and the sages  
And the wise men through the ages  
All that's written down on pages from above  
Just can't adequately describe  
What I'm feeling here inside  
It's just useless to be living without love  
And I'll take her by her hand  
Just a woman and a man  
Without trying to understand what we should be  
She will take me from this world  
Then she'll gently take the world away from me  

Lyrics by Glen Anthony  
Music by Charlie Chaplin  
My love, you are the song  
That sings inside of me  
The song is always the same  
It starts with love and ends with your name  
The more that I love you  
There's more in you to love  
And yet I just don't know how  
I could love you more than I do right now  
They say that love grows old  
But our love turned to gold  
You kissed my sorrows away  
You touched my heart  
What more can I say  
Each day my life is new  
For God blessed me with you  
And when my life is all through  
Without a word you always knew  
That all my life my life was you
