Another day, another small town  
A summer breeze  
The bougainvillea is still in bloom  
His room  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
The morning comes, they take their showers  
They go to work, they do their hours  
It's a routine  
They lean on.  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
His books are on the shelf (It doesn't matter what we do  
Craving curious finger it will never leave us  
His favorite after-shave time that used to pass  
Has now stopped)  
Lingers still....  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
The evening news, they hear them saying  
Tonight's the game, his team is playing  
They go to bed  
Instead.  
  
(phone rings, no-one answers)  
  
Out in the quiet street  
One stray dog is crying  
And if their eyes don't meet  
All is well.

Translation:  
I kissed the rock in her chilly dream  
For she is the silence and I am the scream  
She is the riddle and I want to know  
Both of us sprung from eternity's bow  
  
I kissed the rock, her lonely crater  
She has sworn loyalty, I am the traitor  
She is forever, I am just passing through  
She's the old secret, I am the new  
  
Her silent heart touched, she helped me to know it:  
She is the universe I am the poet

Angel with a broken wing  
Never leaves the ground  
Angel, trying hard to sing  
But she can't make a decent sound.  
  
Angel with a broken wing  
Feeling so alone  
Angel, she's tried everything  
But she can't find her way back home.  
  
So she wanders in disguise  
With a longing in her eyes  
And she looks up to the skies  
But there's nothing there but grey  
She looks down and turns away...  
  
Angel with a broken wing  
In our neighborhood  
Angel, look how things turn bad  
When you're so busy being good  
  
So she wanders in disguise  
With a longing in her eyes  
And she looks up to the skies  
But there's nothing there but grey  
She looks down and turns away...  
  
Angel with a broken wing  
Feeling so alone  
Angel, she's tried everything  
But she can't find her way back home.  
No, she can't find her way,  
Her way back home.

Ave Maria  
Where have you been hiding?  
Don' t you know we need you!  
Things are looking pretty bad down here.  
I know that there is beauty  
Gentleness, and laughter  
These are things you always stood for  
Help us find them too.  
  
Hey, there, Maria!  
Santa Maria... Maria.  
May I take a liberty  
And say that it' s a shame to me  
Not to live in harmony  
Were all just hoping  
Someone will step forward singing...  
Amen, Amen  
  
Ave Maria  
Where have you been hiding?  
Don' t you know we need you!  
Things are looking pretty bad down here.  
I know you hear the fighting  
See the torch we're lighting  
On our quest for peace and freedom  
Help us see this through  
  
Hey, there, Maria!  
Santa Maria... Maria.  
May I take a liberty  
And say that it' s a shame to me  
Not to live in harmony  
We're all just hoping  
Someone will step forward singing...  
Amen

Blue touches blue  
Touches grey touches brown  
I look down at my feet, they've been with me for years  
I take one step for you and then two for myself  
Oh, I need to be stronger  
I need to be stronger  
  
Blue touches blue  
Touches black, then expands  
All the tears and the years in the palm of my hand  
Do you think you can tell me whats wrong and whats wronger?  
I need to be stronger  
I need to be stronger  
  
I want to twist in your arms  
Like a snake that's been charmed  
Like a baby newborn with his arms groping out  
I would shout but there's always a song and  
I need to be stronger  
I need to be stronger  
  
Blue touches blue  
  
I look down at my feet  
  
I take one step for you  
  
I need to be stronger  
  
Blue touches blue  
Touches gray, frothy white  
Where my face is all blurred and reflecting the night  
If I tell you I feel like a bird in the cold  
And I need you to hold me?  
I need you to hold me  
  
Blue touches blue

Ayelet chen, ayelet chen  
Be galut tismacheni  
You ba layla, you ba layla  
Betoch cheyka meloni  
  
In your eyes  
I see something distant  
Waiting for  
  
In your eyes  
I see something constant  
Longing for  
  
The smallest hands  
I've ever seen  
But hard as steel  
The straightest back  
That's ever been  
Deep inside you're shivering  
  
And I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
Don't hide your tears away from me  
I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
  
Ayelet chen, ayelet chen  
Be galut tismacheni  
You ba layla, you ba layla  
Betoch cheyka meloni  
  
In my ear you would always whisper  
Soothing words  
I could hear in your voice beauty  
Different worlds  
  
Too proud to ever ben  
Forest Hills Napoleon  
The village girl turned city cat  
Desert in your velvet hat  
Strength of will turning wheels  
Handkerchief and faded heels  
Silver hair, cheeks of rouge  
And a heart that's huge  
  
And I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
Don't hide your tears away from me  
I feel you  
Every time I look in the mirror  
I feel you  
  
Ayelet chen, ayelet chen  
Be galut tismacheni  
You ba layla, you ba layla  
Betoch cheyka meloni  
  
Every time I look in the mirror and see your eyes

I walk alone into lady night  
She wraps me in her black veils, wraps me tight  
Her velvet touch on my weary eyes  
Kisses softly  
Windy sighs  
  
Lady night in her grandeur flaunts jewels of light  
Flirting with sir half-moon,  
She shimmies slowly backs-o-mountains  
Dips her hair in twilight  
  
Walk alone into lady night  
The woman' s discreet as a grave, and I know she' ll  
Want your tears  
Lady night' s got an appetite  
For sorrow liquidated into pearls of light  
One by one shell gather them to her breast  
Kiss your lowered eyes and bid you rest.  
  
She takes me to her tummy, I clutch her warmth  
I know that I am falling  
She delves into my mind, brings out my darkest thoughts  
To keep her dark from dawning  
(I know that' s what she wants)  
  
I turn my back to lady night  
My mind is clear  
My pearls are in her satchel  
I' ve paid my share of blackness to her.  
  
Turn my back to the lady, though she calls  
She calls...  
But I am going to the dawn  
And she can no longer  
Keep me...

Smile, without a reason why  
Love, as if you were a child,  
Smile, no matter what they tell you  
Don't listen to a word they say  
Cause life is beautiful that way.  
  
Tears, a tidal wave of tears  
Light, that slowly disappears  
Wait, before you close the curtain  
There is still another game to play  
And life is beautiful that way  
  
Here with his eyes forevermore  
I will always be as close as you  
Remember from before  
Now that you're out there on your own  
Remember what is real and  
What we dream is love alone  
  
Keep the laughter in you eyes  
Soon your long awaited prize  
We'll forget about our sorrows  
And think about a brighter day  
Cause life is beautiful that way.  
  
We'll forget about our sorrows  
And think about a brighter day,  
Cause life is beautiful that way  
There's still another game to play  
And life is beautiful that way.

Grow into me like a vine through a sidewalk  
Struggling to reach for the sky  
Grow into me like the veins on my forehead  
that stand out whenever I cry  
  
Oh, I will wrap my arms around you like a long coat in winter  
Oh, will you stay with me on thinning ice and trust me to lead?  
Will you be everything I need?  
  
Climb next to me up the trail, up the mountain  
Even though times running out  
Night falls around, there's no light in the distance  
Only my shadows of doubt  
  
Oh, I will wrap my arms around you like a long coat in winter  
Oh, will you stay with me on thinning ice and trust me to lead?  
Will you be everything I need?  
  
Will you be everything I need?

Sleep little baby don't you fret  
Mamma's going to say a little prayer  
Then mamma's going to get some masking tape  
To fix the hole in the ozone layer  
  
Sleep little angel, baby dove  
Sun's gone down, it's getting late  
Mamma's got her chicken soup of love  
For the bad old world is sick with hate  
  
Wish that I could give you child  
All the beauty I have seen  
Mamma's going to sing you a melody  
That you can hum when you're alone  
  
Now you're in your cozy bed  
Sleep little angel, drop of mud  
There's a journey in your head  
And desert winds blow in your blood  
  
Wicked wold and wicked world  
Howling in the moonless sky  
But mamma's here to fend them off  
Hush little baby, don't you cry

I am a young woman  
With callused hands and feet  
With an ever growing problem  
Buried in me deep  
It has stripped me of my beauty  
With an overwhelming pain  
And on yesterday's proud forehead  
It has burned the mark of Cain  
It happened long ago  
Though it seems like only yesterday  
I had come back home  
After years of wandering astray  
Walked familiar streets  
Never knowing fate would find me there  
And ever since I've been crippled  
'Neath this burden I must bear  
The Mark of Cain, the child of pain  
Of trouble and of war  
Mother nature cannot comfort  
Nor the coolness of the sea  
Lord above, how can I love  
This thing that I abhor?  
Child of pain is growing in me  
Within me he is waging war  
Battling for breath, battling for blood  
And a body of His own  
I've considered the solution  
But that would be my death  
For while I've waited and debated  
He has grown  
Deep in my heart, I wish I could love him  
Erase our past with a mother's embrace  
I want to start fresh but within me I'm fearful  
Will I find my oppressor in his tiny face?  
The Mark of Cain, the child of pain  
Of trouble and of war  
Mother Nature cannot comfort  
Nor the coolness of the sea  
Lord above, how can I love  
This thing that I abhor?  
Child of pain is growing in me  
Deep in my heart, I wish I could love him  
Erase our past with a mother's embrace  
I want to start fresh but within me I'm fearful  
Will I find my oppressor in his tiny face?  
The Mark of Cain, the child of pain  
Of trouble and of war  
Mother Nature cannot comfort  
Nor the coolness of the sea  
Lord above, how can I love  
This thing that I abhor?  
Child of rape is growing in me  
Child of rape is growing in me  
Child of rape is growing in me  
Growing in me, growing in me  

Some boys kiss me,  
Some boys hug me,  
I think they're ok  
If they don't give me copper pennies  
I just walk away  
  
Some boys beg and some boys plead  
But they don't see the light  
Only the boy with the  
Cold harsh cash  
Is always Mr. Right  
  
We are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Some boys moan and some boys groan  
And that's alright with me  
If they can't raise my interest,  
Then I have to let them be.  
Some boys cry and some boys die  
But I don't let them play  
Only boys that save their pennies  
Make my rainy day!  
  
We are living in a material world  
And I am a material girl  
  
Boys may come  
And boys may go  
And that's alright you see  
Experience had made me rich  
And they're after me!  
  
Were living in a material world  
And I am a material girl

Translation:  
I am just so: quiet  
A placid lake I am  
I love the serenity of routine,  
Babies' eyes, Francis Jeam  
  
In days gone by my spirit soared  
Wrapped in crimson it would fly  
At one with mountain tops  
The howling wind, the eagles cry  
  
But that was all in days gone by  
That was long ago  
Things change  
And no, I am just so

there is no space  
in the millimeter between me and you  
and the light turns suddenly blue  
  
in the millimeter between you and me  
I can see  
a snapshot of an orange childhood  
  
and you told me, come, come close  
look at the sun setting into the sea  
and you told me come, come close  
the millimeter between them both  
holds all of the dreams in the world  
  
in the kilometer between me and you  
no flowers bloom  
and a cold white light fills the room  
  
a speedometer with broken arms  
cannot supply  
the numbers that I need to fly  
  
and you told me, come, come close  
look at the sun setting into the sea  
and you told me come, come close  
the millimeter between them both  
holds all of the dreams in the world  
  
in the millimeter between pen and page  
nothing's new  
the same old soul I've had for years  
I give to you  
  
the millimeter 'bove the brow  
cannot hide  
the vast and hollow space  
inside

Who knows what is in her eyes?  
Grey clouds disperse in the four winds.  
A dry riverbed overflows.  
And the horizon opens wide.  
  
Up to the heaven she turns her eyes.  
Searching, diving in to the chilly blue.  
Floating in the air  
Touching the pure golden light  
That glimmers in her hair.  
  
Mishaela, what do you see?  
What is it in your heart  
That greets the desolate silence with such laughter?  
  
It is one rainbow in the east, she says.  
It is all I need.  
  
What more could I want?  
It is all that I need.

Night-time, night-time,  
The moon is looking  
At our little garden below  
  
The blossoming hyacinth  
In our garden abounds  
Night-time,  
The moon is looking down  
  
And the moon turns to the clouds and says:  
Give a little drop of water to the flower beds!  
So the hyacinth can bloom  
In our garden, 'neath the moon  
Night-time  
The moon is looking down  
  
The drops came down, pattered on my pane,  
Quenched the thirst of all the flowers  
Longing for the rain  
Now the hyacinth can grow  
Lovely flowers it will show,  
Night-time  
The moon is looking down  
  
Good night

Monday morning and you tell me:  
Waking up beside you is living in style  
I feel the sun caressing, softly through the shades, and  
For no particular reason, I think I' m gonna smile!  
  
Wake up, sweety, wake up!  
(That' s just what you tell me)  
Sleepy, sleepyhead,  
Your eyes are still afloat  
And the radio carries on in the holy language  
About a million traffic jams from Rishon to Ganot  
  
There' s a little song playing as the day begins  
Bright and clear  
Any minute now the news  
God I hope today well hear  
Good morning, good morning, yeah..  
  
Listen, I' ve decided  
(That' s just what you tell me)  
Both of us are going, but not to work, hurrah!  
We could check the water level of the sea of Galilee  
Or make a run for chocolate-milk  
Down in Yotvata  
  
There' s a little song playing as the day begins  
Bright and clear  
Any minute now the news  
God I hope today well hear  
Good morning, good morning  
  
Let' s take the dusty charade  
Our heartache and longing still stuck on her glass  
We can take it slowly, for history' s before us  
What good would it do us to speed by the past?  
  
There' s a little song playing as the day begins  
Bright and clear  
Any minute now the news  
God I hope today well hear  
Good morning, good morning, yeah!  
Good morning!

Restlessly turning, imprisoned and freed  
Still is the night but that' s not what I need  
Gimme repetitive motion,  
A circle, a notion  
A steam engine dream..  
  
Motor lullabies  
Of turning wheels and bolts  
Motor lullabies  
Rocking me to sleep  
Motor lullabies  
On long and winding roads  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting me  
  
Restlessly turning, imprisoned and freed  
Still is the night but that' s not what I need  
Tenderness found as the rhythmn goes round  
I' m caressed by the sound of my motor lullabies  
Of turning wheels and bolts  
Motor lullabies  
Rocking me to sleep  
Motor lullabies  
On long and winding roads  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting me  
  
Motor, motor sing your song  
Theirs or mine or his  
Motor, motor will I wake  
Close to where my true life is..  
  
Motor lullabies  
Of turning wheels and bolts  
Motor lullabies  
Rocking me to sleep  
Motor lullabies  
On long and winding roads  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting  
Motor lullabies  
Transporting me..  
Transporting  
Transporting me..

Sometimes I am pitted and bare  
Like a small bookstore after a fire  
I know I'll find no harbor there  
The stormy waves keep getting higher  
  
Sometimes I am washed of color  
Like a drawing on the sidewalk after rain  
And I know the time is right now  
To give birth to words again  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Police are running tests  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Squeezed in with all the rest  
  
Sometimes there is no road  
Like the Day of Atonement in a car  
And everything looks different with  
A broken heart  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Police are running tests  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Squeezed in with all the rest  
  
Sometimes I am numb of anger  
Like the Square where memory will wane  
And I try to find comfort in written words  
For this burning pain  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Police are running tests  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Squeezed in with all the rest  
  
Big Mushroom over the city  
Who's to tell the futures course?  
Little Mushroom  
She was found  
Far away from the forest.

Tell me who I am  
Tell me what I'm hearing  
Is it God or man  
Leads us to our fate  
  
Tears cried through the night  
So much we've been fearing  
I know I can fight  
Soon will be too late  
  
It's my heart calling  
It's my heart calling  
It's my heart seeing  
What it wants to see  
  
It's my heart crying  
It's my heart flying  
It's my heart trying  
To set me free  
  
Darkness turns to light  
While my soul is healing  
I know I must fight  
This war deep inside  
  
It's my heart calling  
It's my heart calling  
It's my heart seeing  
What it wants to see  
  
It's my heart crying  
It's my heart flying  
It's my heart trying  
To set me free  
  
Waving banners, swinging swords  
Queens and kings, and other lords  
And the battles of our pride  
Greed and hunger deep inside  
  
All the sorrow born of pain  
Cruelty and cruelty again  
Who will stop this vicious spin  
Open arms and let love in  
Open arms and let love in  
Open arms and let love in  
Open arms and let love in

All night long  
Rumble, tumble, deep down under, under my skin  
  
All night long  
Burning, turning, growing to be my other wing  
  
All night long  
Maybe, baby, you' ll be crazy, crazy for me  
  
All night long,  
Sinking, thinking, wanting to grow, learning to see..  
  
Together we' ll fly, all night long  
Together we' ll fly, all night long..  
  
All night long  
Break out, break in, now we' re making life out of love  
  
All night long,  
Maybe, baby, you will be all i' m dreaming of  
  
All night long  
Touch me, shake me, gently wake me, teach me to sing  
  
All night long  
Slowly, slowly, learning to be my other wing  
  
Together we' ll fly, all night long  
Together we' ll fly, all night long..  
  
Learning to be my other wing..

First there was nothing  
Till I created the word  
First there was nothing  
And nothing was good  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing was heard  
  
And who am I anyway  
If I don' t have a name  
If moving is nothing  
And nothing is shame  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing is moving  
Nothing' s the same  
  
And the word is me  
And I am the word  
My mind is free  
Like a beautiful bird  
And the terms of love  
And the germs of hate  
Nothing is waiting  
Nothing is waiting  
  
First there was darkness  
Till I created the night  
First there was darkness  
And darkness was right  
Darkness is moving  
Darkness is moving  
Into light  
  
And the word is me  
And I am the word  
My mind is free  
Like a beautiful bird  
And the terms of love  
And the germs of hate  
Nothing is waiting  
  
First there was darkness  
Till I created the night  
First there was darkness  
And darkness was right  
Darkness is moving  
Into light...

Now  
There is light coming in  
Through the crack in the door  
  
Now  
There is hope  
Where i' d never expect it before  
  
Now  
There are so many things  
But there' s nothing at all  
  
Now  
You are learning to stand  
I am learning to fall.  
  
Now  
As the air in the night  
Becomes cooler and sweet  
  
Now  
I get up seven times  
Just to cover his feet  
  
Now  
There is pain  
But i' ve packed it away for next year  
  
Now  
There is newness and grace and for now,  
There' s no fear.  
  
Then  
I can hardly remember what then used to be  
  
Then  
There was someone I knew  
Looked exactly like me  
  
I was running and running  
With so much to boast  
  
And I had no idea  
What matters the most  
  
Now  
As the air in the night  
Becomes cooler and sweet  
  
Now  
I get up seven times  
Just to cover his feet  
  
Now  
There is pain  
But i' ve packed it away for next year  
  
Now  
There is newness and grace and for now,  
There' s no fear.  
  
Later  
When all of this has turned to songs  
And faded pics  
  
Later  
When colored wooden blocks  
Turn into heavy bricks  
  
Later  
When you will greet me only  
With the shyest smile  
  
Who knows what later brings?  
And so meanwhile..  
  
Now  
There is light coming in  
Through the crack in the door  
  
Now  
There is hope  
Where i' d never expect it before  
  
Now  
There are so many things  
But there' s nothing at all  
  
Now  
You are learning to stand  
I am learning to fall.

Give me your pain  
Give me your sorrow  
Give me your loneliness  
And broken dreams  
Your bad times  
And your worry  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
Give me your past  
Give me your family  
Give me the walls you build  
And the ones you break  
Your shadows  
And your longing  
Now forget.  
Now forget.  
  
All that will be  
But isn't yet  
Now forget,  
Now forget.  
  
Ill put it all  
In a small wooden box  
With the rusty old lock  
And the sparrows in flight  
Ill guard it with my life  
Through the long long night  
  
You are my eyes  
You are my passion  
You are my journey to where I've been  
You are my reason  
For living  
Now forget  
Now forget.  
  
Ill put it all  
In a small wooden box  
With the rusty old lock  
And the sparrows in flight  
Ill guard it with my life  
Through the long long night  
  
Give me your truth  
Give me your questions  
Give me your longing for what will be  
Give me your daydreams  
And your demons  
Now forget  
Now forget.  
  
All that will be  
But isn't yet  
Now forget  
Now forget  
  
Now forget  
Now forget

I found a path to follow  
I knew it straight away  
Now that I found it I won' t stray  
No, I will not stray,  
Not stray.  
  
I walk through the woods and holler  
The songbirds will laugh and play  
They know I' ve found it and won' t stray  
No, I will not stray,  
Not stray.  
  
The woods are alive with laughter  
The rivers are drunk with mirth  
They all know what I' ve been after  
They' re rejoicing for my rebirth,  
For my rebirth.  
  
I found a path to follow  
But it' s a path for two  
Why don' t you come here beside me  
I won' t stray, no, I will not stray  
From you.

Savior, my savior  
Pouring out over desert sands  
Through parched skin  
And madness.  
  
On chamber after chamber  
'Till it's all run out  
But oh, my savior  
My Savior.  
  
You said: remember  
You said: remember, remember,  
When you're all dried out  
That which was sacred  
That which was sacred  
Remember...  
  
Savior, my savior  
Pouring out over desert sands  
Through parched skin and madness  
On chamber after chamber  
Parched skin and madness.

Translation:  
Perhaps it is here that my road ends  
On the verge of the serene  
Greenish stars drop to my feet  
Slowly as the heart will beat  
  
A pile of brittle autumn leaves  
Bid welcome, as they crack  
The small trees in the field have  
Always known that Id be back  
  
How strange that I have searched for you  
A thousand roads and more  
Until I found you  
And all this time  
You were right next door

Something has changed  
But I don't know what it is  
Something has grown inside  
Something has changed  
But I don't know what it is  
Something has changed  
  
Somebody called  
In the middle of the night  
Somebody called my name  
Somebody called  
In the middle of the night  
Something has changed  
  
Something has flown  
Now I don't know anything  
Something has shown it's face  
Something has come  
And I want to let it in  
Something is telling me it's time to put my weapons  
Down and let it begin  
  
If I would jump  
To the bottom of the well  
What would I find down there?  
Water or sand  
At the bottom of the well  
Think I will jump  
  
Something has changed  
But I don't know what it is  
Something has grown inside  
Something has come  
And I want to let it in  
Something is telling me it's time to put my weapons  
Down and let it begin  
  
Don't forget to call us  
Wear a sweater  
Will you be home for the holidays?  
  
Something has changed

Take me, take me as I am  
Take me, don't let go my hand  
Take the part of me that strives to reach the light  
Take my hand and lead me through the darkest night  
  
Hold me, when I'm feeling low  
Hold me, never let me go  
Hold the part of me that fears the setting sun  
Hold my hand and tell of better days to come  
  
Everyone I know plays games  
Everybody's so untrue  
When it's over what remains  
Nobody but me and you  
  
Hold me, when I fall apart  
Hold me, closer to your heart  
Hold the part of me that vibrates when I sing  
Hold me so I'm not afraid of anything  
  
Everyone I know plays games  
Everybody's so untrue  
When it's over what remains  
Nobody but me and you  
  
So take me, take me as I am  
Take me, don't let go my hand  
Take the part of me that strives to reach the light  
Take my hand and lead me through the darkest night  
  
Take me as I am  
Never let me go  
Take me as I am

My angel  
So much I'd like to tell you  
So much of what I've seen  
I'd plant behind your eyes  
  
My angel  
I know I can't compel you  
To any of my ways  
As you walk beneath the merciless sky  
  
My angel  
My angel  
The more I see, the more I grow  
The less that I seem to know  
Only that  
Life is just a balancing act.  
  
The demons  
The fear that will confine you  
The fire that will burn  
Your innocence away.  
  
The heartbreak  
The pain will seek and find you  
The loneliness will grow  
With each passing day.  
  
My angel  
My angel  
I won't always be there to dry  
The tears that gently fill your eyes  
So will you remember that  
Life is just a balancing act.  
  
My angel  
My angel  
The more I see, the more I grow  
The less that I seem to know  
Only that  
Life is just a balancing act  
Only that  
Life is just a balancing act.

When I look into your eyes, I don't know what to say  
It's been so very long we've been waiting for this day  
When you give me that smile, I don't know what to give you back  
So I say oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
When I look into your eyes, I see your universe  
And how much better your life could be, and how much worse  
I see all that you've done to try and keep you hope intact  
And I say, oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
Oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
Oh, I guess I was blind until I realized the sun only shines  
When it shines in your eyes...  
I say, oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that  
Oh, look at that, look at the beauty of that

It's hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
It's hard to see!  
  
He hides from people, too  
As snails will always do  
And only children's nursery tunes  
Can set him free.  
  
He sees a falling leaf  
A flower opened wide  
He wishes he were different!  
But all he does is hide.  
The silence all around  
Reminds him of the sea  
I'll go so far with you!  
But will you wait for me?  
  
It's hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
It's such a bummer!  
  
Open spaces are a thrill  
And his feelers make him ill  
Is this temporary, will  
It fade with summer?  
  
He sees a falling leaf  
A flower opened wide  
He wishes he were different!  
But all he does is hide.  
The silence all around  
Reminds him of the sea  
I'll go so far with you!  
But will you wait for me?  
  
It's hard to be a snail  
Who wants to hit the trail  
But when your house is on your tail  
It's hard to see!  
  
He hides from people, too  
As snails will always do  
And only children's nursery tunes  
Can set him free.

Now its gone  
Now its passed  
On the edge of a dream we linger..  
How  
The sands of time  
Have slipped between my fingers  
  
Now its gone  
Now its passed  
Forever, it appears..  
A circle  
That's been closed  
And I'm still alive, still here  
  
We shall meet  
And see each other  
For a loving heart can not go wrong  
Like rivers to the sea  
We flow, we stream  
Strive till we arrive  
To touch the dream.

Here we are again  
After everything has happened  
Only you and me  
And the light is fading fast  
Who would have believed  
When the tiny seed was planted  
This would be the year  
When the rain would come at last  
  
Every passing hour  
Changes us  
But I love you more than any day before today  
Today  
  
Listen to my heart  
As it stutters like the raindrops  
Let me fill my soul  
With the beauty of your eyes  
I may be a fool  
But I always want to hold you  
Tenderly I say  
You give reason to my life  
  
Every passing hour  
Changes us  
But I love you more than any day before today  
Today

Too proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit, and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
Now it's gone away  
(There's nothing to fear)  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
It's gone away  
  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinstate your former state of mind  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinvent yourself with space and time  
  
Your name is kin to the winds, sister  
You're kin to the winds, sister  
But you've an alabaster frame  
  
And you're too proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit, and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
Now it's gone away  
(There's nothing to fear)  
Now it's gone away  
(And you gotta let go)  
It's gone away  
  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinstate your former state of mind  
Concentrate, concentrate  
Reinvent yourself with space and time  
  
Your name is kin to the stars, sister  
You're kin to the stars, sister  
But now your perfect body's maimed  
  
Still you're to proud to admit that love is gone  
Too proud to admit the falling from Eden  
Too proud to admit, and much too strong  
The landing was rough  
And the seat belt unfastened  
  
Now it's gone away

Now it's gone away

I wish I had a son  
A little boy  
Bright, with black curly hair.  
I would take his hand in mine  
And stroll slowly, slowly  
Through the garden...  
Little boy.  
  
Uri, I'd call him  
My Uri!  
How gentle and clear this tiny name  
A glimmer of joy  
For my little boy,  
Uri, I'd call him  
Uri, I'd call.  
  
But I am still bitter as Rachel  
I am still praying as Hannah in Shiloh,  
I am still waiting for him.  
I will  
Wait.

And the road and the road  
And the car and the car  
And your wrist touching my hair  
We know we are traveling far, far  
But haven't decided on where  
And the sound of my name in your mouth  
Is spicy and sweet, or as soft as a prayer  
I say, lets turn to the south  
There is nothing and everything there  
  
There's a bottle of water, a bag of dates  
An orange that I can peel  
I can tell you a story, or sing if you want,  
If you're falling asleep at the wheel  
We can talk about when we were kids  
And we thought there was nothing we couldn't achieve  
Then years passed by and blinded our eyes  
Now we need something else you believe  
  
Oooh, something else to believe  
  
You are silent for hours, I hum and I hum  
I feel on the verge of a song  
I wait for the words to come when they come  
Lucky the road is long  
And the music I hear in my head  
Is the dance of the wind  
Sweeping over the plain  
The shade of your eyes,  
The shifting skies,  
And the rest, only love can explain  
  
Oooh, only love can explain  
  
At the top of the mountain the view is stunning  
But soon it gives way to the night  
You say you can tell it's the end of the tunnel  
You ask if I've seen the light  
The slope is steep  
But the road keeps taking us down  
To the river below  
The sound of the wheels, the endless fields  
And I'll go wherever you go  
  
Oooh, go wherever you go

The fresh smell of spring rain that  
Rose from the sidewalk,  
Street lamps and violins, tales that they tell,  
The stars that plunged into my sparkling glass,  
I remember these things,  
I remember them well  
  
But I cannot recall- was it really your eyes  
That sparked off this thunder from heavens  
Above?  
I know not if it was with you, and to you  
That I walked in these streets that howl of love  
  
Spring it was  
Flowering buds impregnated with laughter  
An oath of blood and a wine is taken  
Sworn to be true  
And every stranger's glance I got  
Of longing and of passion,  
I believe with all my heart  
That it was you

We' re born  
We' re crying  
We fall  
We' re trying  
We' re little  
We' re laughing  
We' re lonely sometimes  
  
We grow  
We' re open  
We' re lost  
We' re hoping  
We' re careful  
We' re calling  
We' re leaving behind  
  
You say we need to work together  
With love and care for everyone  
Without the fighting and the anger  
You say the world could be as one  
  
But every time that you say we  
Do you think about me?  
' cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me  
  
We' re strong  
We' re chosen  
We' re scared  
We' re frozen  
We' re hardened  
We' re hopeful  
We' re holding at bay  
  
We take  
We' re giving  
We shake  
We' re living  
We' re lovers  
We' re sinners  
We' re running away  
  
And if we fail to make a difference  
And if our hope is almost gone  
Despite the fighting and the anger  
You say the world could be as one  
  
But every time that you say we  
Do you think about me?  
' cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me  
  
And every time that you say we  
Do you think about me?  
' cause every time that you say we  
I hope you think about me

Try to see it my way,  
Do I have to keep on talking till I can't go on?  
While you see it your way,  
Run the risk of knowing that our love may soon be gone.  
  
We can work it out,  
We can work it out.  
  
Think of what you're saying.  
You can get it wrong and still you think that it's alright.  
Think of what I'm saying,  
We can work it out and get it straight, or say good night.  
  
We can work it out,  
We can work it out.  
  
Life is very short, and there's no time  
For fussing and fighting, my friend.  
I have always thought that it's a crime,  
So I will ask you once again.  
  
Try to see it my way,  
Only time will tell if I am right or I am wrong.  
While you see it your way  
There's a chance that we may fall apart before too long.  
  
We can work it out,  
We can work it out.

In a tenement near the Henry Hudson River  
From my favorite spot on a rusting fire escape  
I would look below.  
And see Mario  
Braving the ferocious dandelions  
  
Mario, our fearless superintendent  
Kept the garden green, despite the parkway smog  
But the flowering weeds  
Their fates decreed  
Pulled, to keep his rosebush from dying  
  
Then I would creep inside, curl up in my bed  
Something strong was pulling at my head  
Pulling at my heart  
  
Wild flower, growing in all the wrong places  
Wild flower, so lonely 'neath that lovely rose bush  
Proper garden's nightmare, queen of opened fields  
Tell me, who will love this wildflower  
For exactly what she is?  
  
Years passed by, we left that red brick building  
Left Mario behind  
For a brand new house  
But my dark brown skin  
On the white washed walls within  
Stood out, so it'd get me up and cryin'  
  
My growing pains had many rooms to fill, then  
Mother never knew  
She had a garden to keep clean  
While there was NY grease  
On her young flower from the Middle East  
She was busy pulling dendelions  
  
Then I would creep inside, curl up in my bed  
Something strong was pulling at my head  
Pulling at my heart  
  
  
Wild flower, growing in all the wrong places  
Wild flower, so lowly 'neath that lovely rosebush  
Proper garden's nightmare, queen of opened fields  
Tell me, who will love this wildflower  
For exactly what she is?

Every moment we decide  
What to open, what to hide  
Every moment we decide  
How to live our lives  
  
Every moment we can learn  
How to better understand  
Who to follow, where to turn  
How to find a friend  
  
I' ll wrap it with love  
Every day and night  
Wrap it up with love  
Watch it fill with light  
Wrap it up with love  
Every way is right.  
  
Wrap it up with love, love, love..  
  
Every moment we grow old  
Trust in no one, so were told  
I won' t live my life in fear  
Rather disappear  
  
Wrap it up with love  
Every day and night  
Wrap it up with love  
Watch it fill with light  
Wrap it up with love  
Every way is right  
  
Wrap it up with love, love, love..
