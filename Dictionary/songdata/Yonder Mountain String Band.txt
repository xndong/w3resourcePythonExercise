  
Sleep on it, see if it makes a difference in the morning  
Go to work, get through the day and try not to remember  
Even if we had something to say,  
Would you hold it dear, would it fly away with you, with you  
  
Long ago, it felt like we were both so much younger  
Here we are a repeat of a classic situation  
Did you build us up just to say how high?  
Would you let me down?  
Even notice that I was with you, with you  
There you go, gone again without an explanation  
So anyway get through the day and try not to remember  
Even if we found nothing to say  
Would it finally hide all the reasons to stay with you, with you  
  

Engine's running hot  
But now it's burnin' down  
Everyone says that this is going well  
But I can hear every sound  
  
Four gray walls  
Make it all seem right  
But everything looks wrong  
In these cheap hotel lights  
  
[Chorus]  
Going up and down  
Down and out  
  
Cheap cologne and expensive perfume  
I've never seen so many lost souls in my life  
Air so thick, so busy and loud  
One crazy young man standing out in the crowd  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One of these days when the sun comes up and I'm tossin' and turnin' alone  
I'm gonna pull myself up outta this state  
I'm gonna make everything seem alright, alright  
Know how it feels with the sun in my eyes, still that heartbroken wind's at my
door  
One of these days I'm gonna wreck myself and this engine won't run no more, no
more  
  
[Chorus: x2]

There's a house somewhere I know where's the fire's burning all night long  
There's a swing outside on the porch where I feel like I'll  
Rock away the dusk until the dawn  
And even though the wind may be howlin'  
The stars are bright and they push me on and on  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
Now the shoes on my feet, those soles broken down  
And my coat is tattered and worn  
And the hunger in my belly, and the fever in my head  
Will vanish 'ere my first glimpse of home  
And even though the rain may now be fallin'  
The passion is deep and pushes me on  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight  
  
There's a still at dawn like the sound of your loves breath  
As she lies sleeping  
Down below me now in the valley  
Is the only piece on earth that I ever want to know  
And her lips are as soft as I remember  
She alone has brought me back on home  
  
There's a half moon risin' in the south eastern skies  
There's a cold wind blowing across the great divide  
And the stars they guide my way across the night  
There's a half moon rising  
It's pushin' me on to another mountain top  
Push me on, no no I'll never stop, push me on home  
There's a half moon rising in the south eastern skies tonight

Don't tie me up and take my time  
Waiting years and wondering why  
I love old songs and what they know  
Just turn 'em up and let 'em go  
  
I ask myself what I need  
Homesick blues and melodies  
This old tune's what I desire  
It's hot as hell it burns like fire, burns like fire  
  
Chorus:  
How 'bout you? How 'bout you?  
I wonder where you're going to  
Flyin' by and out of view  
I'll keep looking, how 'bout you?  
  
I love old lights from the radio  
Nowadays I just don't know  
There's less and less for me to prove  
Just more folks to prove it to, to prove it to  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
Telephones won't let me be  
They never sound like what I need  
Up all night and listenin' to  
The things you say and never do, never do  
  
[ Chorus ]

  
There's a voice blowing over the mountain  
A voice I used to know  
I'll bet you ten it's her again  
That girl from long ago  
  
She wanted California  
Got Oregon I hear  
Seems only fair to warn ya  
I ain't been myself in years  
  
What's left of it all went with her  
Packed up in broken dreams  
I'll tell ya friend I loved her then  
And I always will it seems  
  
Chorus:  
That evening breeze reminds me  
So soft against my ear  
Before she was behind me  
I ain't been myself in years  
  
Sometimes I hear her laughing  
Sometimes I see her face  
Sometimes I think she's coming back  
To fix this broken place  
So easy to see right through me  
Too late to change my ways  
I'll tell ya friend I loved her when  
I wasn't in this haze  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  
I ain't been myself in years  
  

  
Come on mamma, put your good dress on  
The night is young and we're goin' downtown  
Where faces come and faces go  
It ain't very far you know  
  
Come on mamma, is it really that hard  
To lose yourself right where you are  
Till your money's gone and your mind is bent  
You couldn't say where midnight went  
  
Chorus:  
Winding pathways, blind-sided fools  
How could you let them get the best of you  
Stumblin' footfalls, someone calls your name  
Been calling you, stay just the same, just the same  
  
Come on mamma, let it fade away  
For good this time and gone we'll stay  
All the scenes are gonna pass on by  
I swear we'll leave it all behind  
  
[ Chorus ]  
  

A man stood in the shadows his face was dripping sweat  
He took a break from running but he wasn't done yet  
Looked over his shoulder when he heard the barking hounds  
Dug his feet into the earth and headed out of town  
The town line's far away and  
He won't sleep for days  
Because he just slept with Annie and she's the sheriff's wife  
Now the sheriff's men have got him running for his life  
  
He should have known that girl was trouble but he wasn't thinking clear  
When she put her hand onto his leg and filled his glass with beer  
But a deputy did see them and tracked the sheriff down  
Just had time to grab his clothes and high ball out of town  
  
The town line's far away and  
He won't sleep for days  
And even if he makes it, there's nothing he can do  
But hope and pray the sheriff there hasn't heard the news  
  
A man stood in the shadows thinking about the past  
About all the women he had known and living life too fast  
But he heard a noise behind him, felt a gun against his head  
Should have known the sheriff wouldn't rest till he was dead  
  
The town line's far away and  
He's six feet in the grave  
He's lying there with Annie, who was the sheriff's wife  
Till the sheriff and his men robbed them of their lives  
  

  
Headin' down to the river, feelin' all undone  
Might be for the best if I just stare into the sun  
So I can't see, what a fool you made of me  
  
Well, I am sittin' home alone, blue as I can be  
Music turned up loud as hell, it hurts but just as well  
But(?) I can hear people talking 'bout us Dear  
  
Chorus:  
By the looks I get seems I am the last to know  
Apologetic eyes follow me everywhere I go  
I swear I'm twenty-twenty but I never saw the signs  
And now I sit alone and try to ease my troubled mind  
  
Headed down to the barroom to get myself a drink  
Money in my pocket's gonna help me not to think  
of you at all, no I won't think of you at all  
  
Well, I swear that women, she's like a mystery  
I read those pages through and through  
I still don't have a clue 'bout what went wrong  
Or why she left after so long  
  
[ Chorus - x2 ]
