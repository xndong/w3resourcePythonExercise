Well, in eighteen and fourteen we took a little trip  
Along with Colonel Jackson down the mighty Mississip.  
We took a little bacon and we took a little beans,  
And we caught the bloody British near the town of New Orleans.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.  
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, I see'd Mars Jackson walkin down the street  
Talkin' to a pirate by the name of Jean Lafayette [pronounced La-feet]  
He gave Jean a drink that he brung from Tennessee  
And the pirate said he'd help us drive the British in the sea.  
  
The French said Andrew, you'd better run,  
For Packingham's a comin' with a bullet in his gun.  
Old Hickory said he didn't give a dang,  
He's gonna whip the britches off of Colonel Packingham.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.  
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, we looked down the river and we see'd the British come,  
And there must have been a hundred of 'em beatin' on the drum.  
They stepped so high and they made their bugles ring  
While we stood by our cotton bales and didn't say a thing.  
  
Old Hickory said we could take 'em by surprise  
If we didn't fire a musket til we looked 'em in the eyes.  
We held our fire til we see'd their faces well,  
Then we opened up with squirrel guns and really gave a yell.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.  
There wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, we fired our cannon til the barrel melted down,  
So we grabbed an alligator and we fought another round.  
We filled his head with cannon balls and powdered his behind,  
And when they tetched the powder off, the gator lost his mind.  
  
We'll march back home but we'll never be content  
Till we make Old Hickory the people's President.  
And every time we think about the bacon and the beans,  
We'll think about the fun we had way down in New Orleans.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin,  
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
Well, they ran through the briars and they ran through the brambles  
And they ran through the bushes where a rabbit couldn't go.  
They ran so fast the hounds couldn't catch 'em  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.  
  
We fired our guns and the British kept a'comin.  
But there wasn't nigh as many as there was a while ago.  
We fired once more and they began to runnin'  
Down the Mississippi to the Gulf of Mexico.

"While the storm clouds gather far across the sea,  
Let us swear allegiance to a land that's free,  
Let us all be grateful for a land so fair,  
As we raise our voices in a solemn prayer. "  
  
God Bless America,  
Land that I love.  
Stand beside her, and guide her  
Thru the night with a light from above.  
From the mountains, to the prairies,  
To the oceans, white with foam  
God bless America, My home sweet home.

If tomorrow all the things were gone,  
I'd worked for all my life.  
And I had to start again,  
With just my children and my wife.  
  
I'd thank my lucky stars,  
To be livin here today.  
'Cause the flag still stands for freedom,  
And they can't take that away.  
  
And I'm proud to be an American,  
Where at least I know I'm free.  
And I wont forget the men who died,  
Who gave that right to me.  
  
And I gladly stand up,  
Next to you and defend her still today.  
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land,  
God bless the usa.  
  
From the lakes of Minnesota,  
To the hills of Tennessee.  
Across the plains of Texas,  
From sea to shining sea.  
  
From Detroit down to Houston,  
And New York to L. A.  
Well there's pride in every American heart,  
And it's time we stand and say.  
  
That I'm proud to be an American,  
Where at least I know I'm free.  
And I wont forget the men who died,  
Who gave that right to me.  
  
And I gladly stand up,  
Next to you and defend her still today.  
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land,  
God bless the usa.  
  
And I'm proud to be and American,  
Where at least I know I'm free.  
And I wont forget the men who died,  
Who gave that right to me.  
  
And I gladly stand up,  
Next to you and defend her still today.  
'Cause there ain't no doubt I love this land,  
God bless the usa.

Let there be peace on Earth,  
And let it begin with me.  
Let there be peace on Earth,  
The peace that was meant to be.  
  
With God as our Father,  
Brothers all are we,  
Let me walk with my brother,  
In perfect harmony.  
  
Let peace begin with me,  
Let this be the moment now,  
With every step I take,  
Let this be my solemn vow,  
  
To take each moment and live each moment  
In peace, eternally.  
Let there be peace on Earth,  
And let it begin with me.
