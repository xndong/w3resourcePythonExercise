Holl amrantau'r ser ddywedant, ar hyd y nos  
Dyma'r ffordd i fro gogoniant, ar hyd y nos  
Golau arall yw tywyllwch  
I arddangos gwir brydferthwch  
Teulu'r nefoedd mewn tawelwch, ar hyd y nos  
  
Sleep a while and peace attend thee,  
all through the night  
Guardian angels God will lend thee,  
all through the night  
Soft the dreamy hours are creeping  
Hill and vale in slumber sleeping  
God alone his watch is keeping,  
all through the night  
  
Hark the solemn bell is ringing,  
all through the night  
Earthly souls to heaven winging,  
all through the night  
When the last dread call shall wake us  
Do not thou our God forsake us  
But to reign in glory take us, all through the night  

When I'm less than I should be  
And I just can't face the day  
When darkness falls around me  
And I just can't find my way  
When my eyes don't clearly see  
And I stumble through it all  
You I lean upon  
You keep my strong  
And you rise me when I fall  
  
(Chorus)  
You are there when I most need you  
You are there so constantly  
You come shining through  
You always do  
You are always there for me  
  
When life brings me to my knees  
When my back's against the wall  
You are standing there right with me  
  
Just to keep me standing tall  
Though a burden I may be  
You don't weary  
You don't rest  
You are reaching out to carry me  
And I know I'm Heaven-blessed  
  
(Chorus)  
You are there when I most need you  
You are there so constantly  
You come shining through  
You always do  
You are always there for me  
  
(Chorus)  
You are there when I most need you  
You are there so constantly  
You come shining through  
You always do  
You are always there for me  
For me.

Safodd Glyndur ar fynyddoedd Meirionnydd  
A chysgod y plygain yn drwm ar ei wedd  
Clywodd riddfanau yn esgyn o'are cymoedd  
Plygodd I wrando, a'i bwys ar ei gledd.  
  
Safodd yn hir ar fynyddoedd Meirionnydd  
A'i galon yn gwaedu dros gyflwr ei wlad.  
Breuddwydiodd am uno ei genedl ranedig,  
Chwifiodd ei gleddyf ym mhoethder y gad.  
  
Plygodd I farw dan gysgod y creigiau,  
Canodd wrth huno a gwenodd drwy'i hun.  
Gwelodd y wawrddydd yn gwynu'are mynyddoedd  
A'i genedl yng ngolau'are dyfodol yn un.  
  
English:  
Glendower stodd on the mountains of Meirionnydd  
The shadow of the dawn weighing heavily on his mind  
He heard the groans ascending from the valleys  
He knelt to listen, supported by his sword.  
  
He stood for a long while on the mountains of Meirionnydd  
His heart bleeding over the state of his country  
He dreamt of uniting his divided nation  
He brandished his sword in the heat of battle.  
  
He lay to die under the shade of rocks  
He sang as he slumbered, yet smiling in death  
He saw the dawn lighting up the mountains  
And his nation in that bright future again united.

Lully, lulla, thou little tiny child  
By by, lully lullay  
  
O sisters too  
How may we do  
For to preserve this day?  
This poor youngling  
For whom we sing  
By by, lully lullay!  
  
Herod, the king  
In his raging  
Charged he hath this day  
  
His men of might  
In his own sight  
All young children to slay  
  
That woe is me  
  
Poor child for thee!  
And ever morn and day  
For thy parting  
Neither say nor sing  
By by, lully lullay!

Did you not hear my lady  
Go down the garden singing?  
Blackbird and thrush were silent  
To hear the alleys ringing  
O saw you not my lady  
Out in the garden there?  
Shaming the rose and lily  
For she is twice as fair  
  
Though I am nothing to her  
Though she must rarely look at me  
And though I could never woo her  
I love her till I die  
  
Surely you heard my lady  
Go down the garden singing?  
Silencing all the songbirds  
And setting the alleys ringing  
  
But surely you see my lady  
Out in the garden there  
Rivalling the glittering sunshine  
With a glory of golden hair

Said the night wind to the little lamb,  
"Do you see what I see?  
Way up in the sky, little lamb,  
Do you see what I see?  
A star, a star, dancing in the night  
With a tail as big as a kite,  
With a tail as big as a kite"  
  
Said the little lamb to the shepherd boy,  
"Do you hear what I hear?  
Ringing through the sky, shepherd boy,  
Do you hear what I hear?  
A song, a song high above the trees  
With a voice as big as the sea,  
With a voice as big as the sea"  
  
Said the shepherd boy to the mighty king,  
"Do you know what I know?  
In your palace warm, mighty king,  
Do you know what I know?  
A child, a child shivers in the cold  
Let us bring him silver and gold,  
Let us bring him silver and gold"  
  
Said the king to the people everywhere,  
"Listen to what I say!  
Pray for peace, people everywhere,  
Listen to what I say!  
The child, the child sleeping in the night  
He will bring us goodness and light,  
He will bring us goodness and light"

Its not time to make a change,  
Just relax, take it easy.  
You're still young, that's your fault,  
There's so much you have to learn.  
Find a girl, settle down,  
If you want you can marry.  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.  
  
I was once like you are now, and I know that it's not easy,  
To be calm when you've found something going on.  
But take your time, think a lot,  
Think of everything you've got.  
For you will still be here tomorrow, but your dreams may not.  
  
How can I try to explain, when I do he turns away again.  
It's always been the same, same old story.  
From the moment I could talk I was ordered to listen.  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  
I know I have to go.  
  
It's not time to make a change,  
Just relax take it easy.  
You're still young, that's your fault,  
There's so much you have to learn.  
Find a girl, settle down,  
If you want you can marry.  
Look at me, I am old, but I'm happy.  
  
All the times that I cried, keeping all the things I knew inside,  
It's hard, but it's harder to ignore it.  
If they were right, I'd agree, but it's them they know not me.  
Now there's a way and I know that I have to go away.  
I know I have to go.

Hallelujah  
  
Now I've heard there was a secret chord  
That David played, and it pleased the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
It goes like this  
The fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall, the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
Hallelujah  
  
Your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
She tied you  
To a kitchen chair  
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair  
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
You say I took the name in vain  
I don't even know the name  
  
But if I did, well really, what's it to you?  
There's a blaze of light  
In every word  
It doesn't matter which you heard  
The holy or the broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
I did my best, it wasn't much  
I couldn't feel, so I tried to touch  
I've told the truth, I didn't come to fool you  
And even though  
It all went wrong  
I'll stand before the Lord of Song  
With nothing on my tongue but Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah

One day I'll hear the laugh of children  
In a world where war has been banned  
One day I'll see, men of all colours  
Sharing words of love and devotion  
  
Stand up and feel, the holy spirit  
Find the power of your faith  
Open your heart to those who need you  
In the name of love and devotion  
  
'Cause I believe in the people  
Of all nations  
To join and to care for love  
I believe in a world  
Where light will guide us  
And giving our love  
We'll make heaven on earth  
  
The things we never said come together  
The hidden truth no longer haunting me  
Tonight we touched on the things that were never spoken  
That kind of understanding sets me free

In the bleak mid-winter frosty wind made moan  
Earth stood hard as iron, water like a stone  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow, snow on snow  
In the bleak mid-winter, long ago  
  
Heaven cannot hold Him, nor earth sustain  
Heav'n and earth shall flee away, when He comes to reign  
In the bleak mid-winter a stable-place sufficed  
God The Lord Almighty, Jesus Christ  
  
Enough for him whom cherubim worship night and day  
A breastful of milk and a manger full of hay  
Enough for him whom angels fall down before  
The ox and ass and camel which adore  
  
What can I give Him poor as I am?  
If I were a shepherd I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man I would do my part  
Yet what I can I give Him, give my heart

Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day walk on water?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will save our sons and daughters?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has come to make you knew?  
And this child that you've delivered  
Will soon deliver you  
  
Oh, Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will give sight to a blind man?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will calm a storm with His hand?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy has walked where angels trod?  
And when you kiss your little baby  
You've kissed the face of God  
  
The blind will see  
The deaf will hear  
The dead will live again  
Oh, the lame will leap  
The dumb will speak  
The praises of the Lamb  
  
Oh, Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy is Lord of all creation?  
Mary, did you know  
That your baby boy will one day rule the nations?  
Did you know  
That your baby boy is heaven's perfect Lamb?  
This sleeping child you're holding  
Is the Great I am  
  
The Great I am  
The Great I am  
The Great I am

O come ye, O come ye to Bethlehem  
Come and behold him  
Born the King of angels  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
O come, let us adore him,  
Christ the Lord

Very God begotten, not created

Christ the Lord, the Lord!

O little town of Bethlehem  
How still we see thee lie  
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep  
The silent stars go by  
Yet in thy dark streets shineth  
The everlasting Light  
The hopes and fears of all the years  
Are met in thee tonight  
  
For Christ is born of Mary  
And gathered all above  
While mortals sleep, the angels keep  
Their watch of wondering love  
O morning stars together  
Proclaim the holy birth  
And praises sing to God the King  
And Peace to men on earth  
  
O holy Child of Bethlehem  
Descend to us, we pray  
Cast out our sin and enter in  
Be born to us today  
We hear the Christmas angels  
The great glad tidings tell  
O come to us, abide with us  
Our Lord Emmanuel

Places, I still remember places  
Those precious times and places  
When everything was new  
  
Places, I still can feel those places  
Our hearts were never lighter  
The sky was twice as new  
  
Places, what happen to those places?  
Though they have changed forever  
I'm still in love with you  
  
Moments, do you remember moments?  
And nothing seems to matter  
Apart from me and you  
  
Passion, wilder than the ocean  
Timeless as the mountain  
We grew closer  
We grew wiser every day  
  
Places, I still remember places  
Those precious times and places  
When everything was new  
  
Places, do you remember places  
And nothing seems to matter  
I'm still in love with you

Only you San Damiano,  
Lady of the roses own  
Only you San Damiano,  
Far from here but close to home  
  
I want you to go, same as me.  
I want you to know all I see  
  
All corners of the world a message to be heard  
With heart and soul, heart and soul,  
  
Only you San Damiano,  
Lady of the roses own  
Only you San Damiano,  
Far from here but close to home  
  
Oh tranquillity all around,  
Peace and mystery to be found  
  
Travel the world and still, can other places fill  
Your heart and soul, heart and soul,  
  
Only you San Damiano,  
Lady of the roses own  
Only you San Damiano,  
Far from here but close to home  
  
Corner of paradise, a golden chain has tied us  
Heart and soul, heart and soul.  
  
Only you San Damiano,  
Lady of the Roses own,  
Only you San Damiano,  
Far from here but close to home.

As I walked down the road at set of sun  
The lambs were coming homewards one by one  
I heard a sheepbell softly calling them  
Along the little road to Bethlehem  
  
Beside an open door as I drew nigh  
I heard sweet Mary sing a lullaby  
She sang about the lambs at close of day  
And rocked her tiny King among the hay  
  
Across the air the silver sheepbells rang  
"The lambs are coming home," sweet Mary sang  
"Your star of gold, your star of gold is shining in the sky  
So sleep, my little King, go lullaby"  
  
As I walked down the road at set of sun  
The lambs were coming homewards one by one  
I heard a sheepbell softly calling them  
Along the little road to Bethlehem

Pan fyddai'are nos yn olau,  
A llwch y ffordd yn wyn,  
A'are bont yn wag sy'n croesi'are dur

Wrth angor dan y lloer,

Trostynt yn chwipio'n oer,

Owls  
  
When the night was clear  
And the dust on the road was white,  
The bridge empty across the silent  
Waters of Pen Llyn  
The owls were heard in turn  
From Llwyncoed, Cwm-y-glo.  
  
As the wild ducks swayed,  
Anchored in the moonlight,  
And the lake on Ffridd y Llyn  
Whipped so cold,  
They called without remorse  
To the roar of the wind from Mynydd Du woods.  
  
As the clear water of Glaslyn slid  
Into the dusk, as a sword in it sheath  
And the distant windows of the mansion reddened  
Amidst the green branches of the rooks  
When fatigue silenced the dogs,  
Night fell on Ynysfor to their sound.  
  
And when the creation will darken  
After its long mad day  
And the ultimate silence befalls  
Every worker and every job,  
Their Latin tones will I warrant you  
Be neither happy nor sad 'Too whit Too hoo'!

Te lucis ante terminum  
Rerum creator poscimus  
Ut solita clementia

Before the ending of the day  
Creator of the world we pray  
That with thy wonted favour thou  
Would be our guard and keeper now  
  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me under the shadow of thy wings  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me, hide me, hide me  
  
The heaven soars with voices above  
The skies resound the power of your love  
The stars shine out your glorious light  
  
Shine through our gloom and take us on high  
  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me under the shadow of thy wings  
Keep me as the apple of an eye  
Hide me, hide me, hide me  
  
Sancto Spiritu

What sweeter music can we bring  
Than a carol, for to sing  
The birth of this our heavenly King?  
Awake the voice! Awake the string!  
  
When children would reach for their stockings  
And open the presents they found  
The lights on the tree would shine bright in their eyes  
Reflecting the love all around  
  
She leaned with her head on the window  
Watching evergreen bend in the snow  
Remembering Christmas the way it had been  
So many seasons ago  
  
This year there's no one to open the gifts  
No reason for trimming the tree  
And just as a tear made it's way to the floor  
She heard voices outside start to sing  
  
What sweeter music can we bring,  
Than a carol for to sing  
The birth of this our heavenly King?  
Awake the voice! Awake the string!  
  
Carolers sang as he opened the door  
Faces of friends in the crowd  
And all of the shadows of lonely reminders  
Driven away by the sound  
  
Now the heart that for years had been silent  
Was suddenly filled with the new King  
As she clung to their hands like a child in the night  
She found herself this revelling  
  
What sweeter music can we bring,  
Than a carol for to sing  
The birth of this our heavenly King?  
The birth of this our heavenly King?

When I am down and, oh my soul, so weary  
When troubles come and my heart burdened be  
Then I am still and wait here in the silence  
Until you come and sit awhile with me  
  
There is no life, no life without its hunger  
Each restless heart beats so imperfectly  
But when you come and I am filled with wonder  
Sometimes I think I glimpse eternity  
  
You raise me up so I can stand on mountains  
You raise me up to walk on stormy seas  
I am strong when I am on your shoulders  
You raise me up to more than I can be.
