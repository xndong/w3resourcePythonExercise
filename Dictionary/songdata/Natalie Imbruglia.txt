(colonna sonora del film delle winx)  
  
Promises have meaning once again  
And broken dreams are drifting to an end  
I'm feel it like my life has just begun  
  
I'm waking for the first time, waking for the first time  
Waking for the very first time to the sun  
  
I'm getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Oh it's even better than before  
You open your heart and then you open the door  
I'm getting all the magic  
  
Desert land is drinking from the sky  
Ever since I heard the words that made me cry  
There's love in shadows waiting to be seen  
  
I'm waking for the first time, waking for the first time  
Waking for the very first time to a dream  
  
I'm getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
Oh It's even better than before  
You open your heart and then you oprn the door  
I'm getting all the magic  
  
I'm getting a feeling that I want to explore  
My heart to the ceiling and my feet off the floor  
You let in all the magic  
  
I'm getting all the magic  
I'm getting all the magic  
  
Could you imagine, all the magic  
I'm getting all the magic

What do I do with all the roses, outside?  
They're not suppose to grow this time of year  
It's a heart break but you got me smiling  
And you're the only one who can get me through  
  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name  
  
I can remember when a day lasted forever  
Summer was everything and there was nothing to fear  
You were so tired but your heart sense so much  
Nobody else got through quite like you  
  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name  
  
Did I get hit by the moonlight under the stars  
'Cause you feel so close that I can reach you wherever you are  
  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name  
I can hear your voice when you're whispering  
I can feel your heart when it's beating  
I believe you're near when the ghost comes in  
I can hear you when you're calling out my name

There's colours inbetween us,  
Oh, but still it looks the same.  
You stand here before me,  
Waking me up with it's wonderful pain.  
The buzzer's gone before us.  
Then you wake up and your walking in circles.  
Shaking the hand of bad habits again,  
Again....  
  
This is right now,  
Trust me somehow.  
Let it be, just let it be.  
Walk out the door.  
  
Something better,  
Always never,  
'Cause misery loves company,  
You can be sure.  
  
You're looking in the mirror,  
Oh, your scratching off my skin,  
You think I didn't notice,  
The madness and torture is drawing me in,  
The satalite is watching,  
And then you come home,  
And you switch on your sorrow,  
Boil up a bad mood,  
Shaking the hand of bad habits again,  
Again...  
  
This is right now,  
Trust me somehow,  
Let it be, just let it be,  
Walk out the door.  
  
Something better,  
Always never,  
'Cause misery loves company,  
You can be sure.  
  
Always never, always never,  
Let it be, just let it be  
Walk out the door  
Always never,always never,  
'Cause misery loves company,  
You can be sure.

She's been waiting in the cold  
Waiting for her moment  
Killing time  
Sitting in the ballroom  
Hoping he will notice  
  
Heavenly  
She put a spell on me  
Heavenly  
Where's she gone?  
Amelia  
  
She's been caught up in the twilight  
Always on the outside  
Slowly drowning in the water  
Drowning from the tears  
Those green eyes  
She's a pretty flower  
Waiting in wind  
  
Heavenly  
She put a spell on me  
Heavenly  
Where's she gone?  
  
So don't disappear  
Shine  
So don't disappear  
Shine  
Don't know how sometimes  
Don't know shine, shine  
See your Amelia  
There's nothing to fear  
Don't disappear  
Shine  
See your Amelia  
There's nothing to fear  
Don't disappear  
Shine  
There's noting to fear  
Don't disappear  
Amelia  
There's nothing to fear  
So don't disappear  
Shine (x2)

Here it comes again  
Cannot out run my desire  
Cover my decent  
And throw the  
Beauty on the fire  
Drawn towards the edge  
Do I assume I could fly  
Every secret shared  
Why do I drink  
The feelings dry  
Don't go too far  
Limitation scars  
  
Tonight  
Could I be lost forever  
To drown  
My soul in  
Sensory  
Pleasure  
Sensory  
Pleasure  
  
Here it comes again  
You raise the bar even higher  
I cannot catch my breath  
So throw the  
Beauty on the fire  
Don't push too hard  
Limitaion scars

There's no sign on the gate  
and there's mud on your face  
Don't ya think it's time we re-investigate this situation?  
Put some fruit on your plate  
You've forgotten how it started.  
Close your eyes  
think of all the bubbles of love we made,  
and you're down on your knees  
it's too late.  
Oh don't come crawlin'  
and you lie by my feet.  
what a big mistake.  
I see you fallin'  
got a buzz in my head  
and my flowers are dead.  
Can't figure out a way to rectify this situation.  
I don't believe what you said  
you forgotten how it started  
Close your eyes  
think of all the bubbles of love we made  
and you're down on your knees  
it's too late.  
Oh don't come crawlin'  
and you lie by my feet.  
what a big mistake.  
I see you fallin'  
I could sting like a bee.  
Careful how you treat me  
baby I don't think I'll accept your sorry invitation.  
Close the door as you leave  
and you cry over me.  
I can't wait.  
I feel you stallin'  
and you try to reach me.  
What a big mistake.  
I hear you calling.  
(Chorus)

Broken Thread  
Waking early I hear myself breathing  
Covered up in my hand me down hand me down  
Hiding under my patchwork freezing  
With my wedding dress calling me, calling me  
I dress myself in dis-function  
Do I drown you in sympathy, sympathy  
You could be my winter messiah  
Scarred around and around me....around me  
Cause I'm stiched up like an angel chord, I'm fixed up  
They try to run and hide somehere in there defense  
And now want to hand me down again.....  
On a broken thread  
On a broken thread  
I choose to set you on fire  
No-more wearing and tearing me, tearing me  
Your still my only desire  
And now it seems like your leaving me, freeing me, healing me.  
Cause I'm stiched up like an angel chord, I'm fixed up  
They try to run and hide somehere in there defense  
And now want to hand me down again.....  
They try to run and hide somehere in there defense  
And now want to hand me down again.....  
On a broken thread  
On a broken thread  
On a broken thread  
On a broken thread  
On a broken thread  
  

Ooh  
A little closer in the pool  
And I have something that you crave  
But you know all about it  
Climb  
Give me a minute of your time  
And I could figure out a way  
To make you worth your wild  
  
'Cause I am drawn to you  
And everybody stares when you walk into the room  
But you keep disappearing  
  
Have I told you  
You're my cameo  
Want you love it  
Here we go  
Cameo  
  
Leave  
Or you'll find yourself in me  
Or something more than you can taste  
And it'll drive you wild  
I was a slave to every signal that you gave  
You had me ready for the chase  
And there's no denial  
  
'Cause I am drawn to you  
And everybody stares when you walk into the room  
But you keep disappearing  
  
Have I told you  
You're my cameo  
Want you love it  
Here we go  
Cameo  
  
I want you in it  
Give me a minute  
I want you in it  
  
Have I told you  
You're my cameo  
Want you love it  
Here we go  
Cameo-o-o

Had a dream  
Had a drowning dream I was in a river of pain  
Only difference this time  
I wasn't calling out your name yeah!  
Has it ended before it's begun  
You hold on  
And I try to run but  
Anybody heading in my direction  
Away from the city  
Anybody want to change the way they feel  
step inside  
Doesn't really matter where you want to take me  
Away from the city  
I want to start again  
I want to start again  
A want to take it back  
I want to start again  
Start again  
Funny how those friends forget you when you tired of their games  
You miss a show or a party that blows  
And they've forgotten your name, yeah  
And you wonder what you've become  
They pull you back when you try to run  
Well anybody heading in my direction  
Away from the city  
Anybody want to change the way they feel  
Step inside  
Doesn't really matter where you want to take me  
Away from the city  
I want to start again  
I want to start again  
A want to take it back  
I want to start again  
Start again  
I left the me I used to be  
I want to see this through  
Left the me I used to be  
If only you'd see it too  
Well I wonder what you've become  
You pull me back when I try to run  
Well anybody heading in my direction  
Away from the city  
Anybody want to change the way they feel  
Step inside  
Doesn't really matter where you want to take me  
Away from the city  
I want to start again  
I want to start again  
A want to take it back  
I want to start again  
Start again

Her bones will ache, her mouth will shake  
And as the passion dies her magic heart will break  
She'll fly to France, but there's no chance  
No hope for Cinderella  
  
Come September  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September  
  
Her violet sky, will need to cry  
And if it doesn't rain then everything will die  
She needs to heal, she needs to feel  
Something more than tender  
  
Come September  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September  
  
The souls that burn will twist and turn  
And find you in the dark no matter where you run  
she's made her mark but lost her spark  
And what she's looking for she can't remember  
  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September  
  
Her eyes surrender her cries  
A crying shame  
Comin' undone is she aver gonna feel tha same  
  
She will run, she's gonna drink the sun  
Shining there for you instead of everyone  
And so it goes she'll stand alone  
And try not to remember  
Come September  
  
Everything wrong gonna be alright  
Come September

Seventeen years in a dead end job,  
Telling his dreams to a deaf-eared god.  
Hanging on tight by a single thread,  
Praying for a change.  
Everything you could've sacrificed,  
Your flesh and blood had it's own sweet price.  
Baby's all grown up and moved away,  
Where's that leave you now?  
It was your own decision,  
You made my life a mission.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Working so hard to be understood,  
Doing so much for the common good.  
Sorry if I didn't see the truth  
The sadness in your eyes.  
I wanted to stand on my own two feet,  
Looking at life as a one-way street.  
Thinking that I had all worked out,  
Where's that leave me now?  
We lost communication,  
Too many expectations.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
Everything I have inside,  
I kept it wrapped up tight.  
All I know is,  
All I want to know is,  
Somebody tell me.  
Somebody tell me,  
(It doesn't make any sense at all)  
Somebody tell me,  
Why we're living in a world of contradiction.  
In a world of contradiction.  
Seventeen years in a dead end job,  
Telling his dreams to a deaf-eared god.  
Hanging on tight by a single thread,  
Where's that leave you now?

Why should it be,  
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again.  
Haven't I learned,  
People get hurt,  
When they go diving in the deep end  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end.  
Thought I was smart,  
Controlling the art, of turning off my intuition  
Haven't I seen, since I was fourteen.  
That life is all just repitition  
You lose or you win,  
You sink or you swim,  
When you go diving in the deep end,  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end,  
In the deep end.  
Now it's time to realise,  
You don't have to agonise  
You don't have to compromise  
But the one thing you must do  
Is open your eyes  
Your eyes,  
Your eyes.  
Why should it be,  
Someone like me could make the same mistakes again.  
Haven't I learned,  
People get hurt,  
When they go diving,  
Diving, diving (fade).  

Child, it's broke  
And I feel you  
Slipping away  
Child, you spoke  
And the world  
Fell silent again  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
Child, undone  
By fear of falling  
Through cracks  
Child, by one mistake  
You've lost your way back  
(Something's gotta  
Turn you round)  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels shout  
Is your heart strung out  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels fall  
Have you lost it all  
  
Child be still  
In the storm  
To wave us goodbye  
Child we will  
Return to dance  
With the sky  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels shout  
Is your heart strung out  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels fall  
Have you lost it all  
  
Do you love  
Do you need love  
When your angels cry  
Does your spirit die

Some people  
Don't worry  
'bout nothing  
Don't know what's going on  
I'm not one  
Who can't say they're sorry  
I just care what's going on  
There's more important things  
Than making sure your watch looks just right  
And second hand opinions  
Don't make you look any smarter  
Don't you think  
Don't you think  
Don't you think that maybe  
it's time , yes it's time  
Time you started thinking  
Time you started thinking  
And don't just sweeten up the taste  
Brother shoots brother  
But meanwhile you're fixing up your face  
You're not affected by the truth  
Unless it's on your doorstep  
Deodorise your paradise  
No point in getting crazy  
Don't you think  
Don't you think  
Don't you think that maybe  
It's time , yes it's time  
Time you started thinking 'bout things in the back of your head  
Someone said before you turn a blind eye  
Hear a bell ring sex sells everything  
But I don't buy it so don't try it  
Sleeping in the small world head in the sand  
Better wash your hands , make a new plan  
There's more important things  
Than making sure your shoes just walk right  
Ignore reality there's nothing you can do about it . . .  
The clothes you wear don't make the man  
It's just another party  
(Chorus)

I hear your silent scream  
Deep in your private dream  
Two ways to go from here  
One way will bring you near  
Fragile wish  
  
Full moon, no rain, no shame  
That distance still remains  
More shades of grey to come  
We've been through more than one  
Close your eyes  
  
Like a frightened child  
Fragile in spirit  
Like a wind blowin' wild  
No name you can give it  
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time  
  
No tricks, no slight of hand  
Find somewhere safe to land  
Before your walls were shaken  
But now the whole thing's brakin'  
And it makes you feel  
  
Like a frightened child  
Fragile in spirit  
Like a wind blowin' wild  
No name you can give it  
Like an infant I see in the light for the very first time  
  
Yes, your right  
What is right?  
Yes it's night I can tell  
  
Yes it shows  
Yes I know  
You're a beautiful stranger to yourself

So long, I've been waiting to sing this song  
Now I should, if is worth it anymore  
When kin at me most  
People always ask it, about you  
And people always want to talk about you  
Sometimes when I sleep  
I think about you, with you, we're so one  
  
Didn't we have fun?  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
  
Try  
Never stop to wonder why  
Oh how  
I just hope you're happy now  
Hope you're happy now  
  
People always ask it, about you  
And people always want to talk about you  
Sometimes when I sleep  
I think about you, with you, we're so one  
  
Didn't we have fun?  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
Didn't we have fun?  
Though it hurt like air, yeah  
I don't want to forget  
  
Didn't we have fun?  
I know it hurts like air wave  
You complete with someone  
Didn't we have fun?  
Though it hurt like air, yeah  
I don't want to forget  
I don't want to forget

Walking down the Frith Street  
Dawn is creeping up on me  
Some girls tears in a taxi  
Five o'clock shadows, drinking coffee  
  
So this is what it feels like  
This is how it feels, now I'm finally smiling on the inside  
This is what it looks like  
This is how it looks from the outside staring in  
  
And it's glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn, it'll never stop  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And we've got nothing to lose, oh yeah  
  
And it's glorious, and it's all I see  
On a day like this you know it's meant to be  
Now I've got nothing to find  
And I've got nothing to lose but you  
And it's glorious  
  
Drinking wine back in my house  
Remember someone said your name  
I somehow lost the conversation  
I've fallen a million miles away  
  
So this is what it feels like  
This is how it feels when you're finally walking on the inside  
This is what it looks like  
This is how it looks from the outside staring in  
  
And it's glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn, it'll never stop  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And we've got nothing to lose, oh yeah  
  
And it's glorious, yeah it's all I see  
On a day like this you know it's meant to be  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And I've got nothing to lose but you  
  
Keep wanting a little, a little more  
Keep walking, keep walking  
Keep getting a little, a little more  
Keep running, keep running  
  
Ooh, walking down the Frith Street  
  
And it's glorious just to laugh like us  
And the world will turn, will never, never stop  
Cause I've got nothing to hide  
And we've got nothing to lose, oh yeah  
  
And it's glorious, and it's all I see  
On a day like this I know it's meant to be  
Cause I've got nothing to find  
And I've got nothing to lose but you  
And it's glorious

Every days the same  
I feel them merge  
I try to separate  
Resist the urge  
  
But they tell me I'll be fine  
That it'll all get better  
Just try to write it down  
Or put it in a letter  
  
Still the words won't play,  
And there's no easy way to say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
  
Keep my head on straight  
And don't look down  
When all I've pushed away  
I'm losing ground  
  
But they tell me I'll be fine  
That it'll all get better  
Just try to write it down  
Or put it in a letter  
  
Still the words won't play  
And there no easy way to say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye  
  
And from the sidelines watch me  
Fall down  
Don't understand the things I do  
But they tell me I'll be fine  
As long I keep moving  
Just try to write it down  
Till things just keep improving  
  
Still the words won't play  
And there's no easy way to say  
  
Goodbye, goodbye

Tonight everything but me  
Taken out to sea  
All gone  
A wish written in the sand  
Washed away tomorrow  
This time  
Look what I've become  
  
Didn't run  
Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
  
And I wanted everything  
Salted you could bring me  
Daylight  
A dream burning in the sky  
Leaves my spirit dry  
And you lied  
Now look what I've become  
  
Didn't run  
Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
Couldn't run  
Lost in what you'd done  
Look what I've become.  
  
This time  
Look what I've become  
Didn't run  
Run from what you'd done  
Didn't hide behind the sun  
Couldn't run  
Lost in what you'd done  
Look what I've become.

End of the third round  
As I put the phone down  
Chasing the same lines  
Over the old ground  
I'm pushing zero  
Where is my hero  
He's out there somewhere  
left of the middle  
  
And your world falls down  
And you're the calling out  
But it's something I can't say  
Though it seems the only way  
But its a game that I can't play - Not today  
  
I got my ticket  
And I got a straight road  
But I'm passing the same signs  
Over and over  
  
And my world falls down  
And you're the calling out  
But it's something I can't say  
Though it seems the only way  
But its a game that I can't play - Not today  
  
And my world falls down  
And you're the calling out  
But it's something I can't say  
Though it seems the only way  
But its a game that I can't play - Not today  
  
I need to tell you  
Trying to get it through  
It's not always easy  
Left of the Middle

They call him "Lukas"  
Climbing the stairs to talk to you  
Comin' to tell his story  
Every single one of which is true  
Hello, Lukas  
I'm please to meet you, now how do you do?  
  
So they go driving  
Out to the river like lovers do  
You smell out the summer  
Baby, the summer just smells of you  
One day, I'm gonna be a famous writer  
Some book like love in the afternoon  
It was all Lukas could say  
Maybe one day, we could run away, run away  
  
I thought we never last  
I thought we never last  
  
Now here comes Lukas  
He done everything he wanna do  
It was twenty years later  
Come back to do what he promised to  
He come back to make her happy  
But these things don't always wait for you  
And poor Lukas was late  
That's when he got back, she'll be married today  
Gone away  
  
I thought we never last  
I thought we never last  
  
And Lukas would say  
For a million lonely people  
Another long gone  
For a million hearts that opened  
A million break  
And the world's just a fallen angel in my way  
I'm up in heaven, you can hear them say  
Lookin' for Lukas but Lukas was always runnin' away

I'm Feelin' kind of strange  
I'm feelin' kind of jammed up and out of the way  
I know it's all deranged  
And now that's gonna give 'til I'm out of this place  
Look at the horizon  
Want it to the one where is flawless  
I'm gonna take your time  
I wanna wonder if you float while the sea is rising  
  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know the way you make me feel  
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go  
Here we go again  
  
My god  
Your face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
I'll give my soul  
There's nothing else my god  
Don't you leave me here  
  
You're looking for a flower  
You're looking for a flower but you find a tree  
I'm looking for a river  
And suddenly an ocean's washing over me  
  
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know, I don't know  
I don't know the way you make me feel  
Here we go, here we go, here we go, here we go  
Here we go again  
  
My god  
Your face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
I'll give my soul  
There's nothing else my god  
  
I wanted to know you  
Wanted to see you  
Wanted to feel you  
Should've believed you  
Wanted to hold you  
Wanted to show you  
Wanted to be you, be you  
  
My god  
Face is so beautiful  
My god  
I see you so clear  
If I could stay with you  
Oh my god  
I'll give my soul  
There's nothing else my god  
Don't you leave me here

You got it the wrong way 'round completely  
The fact that I love you so  
Doesn't make me a fool  
One day you just might grow tired of chasing  
The end of a rainbow  
You're already there you know  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
Remember the day you came to see me  
Even that lonely long drive  
Couldn't keep us apart  
And you opened up to me completely  
And you gave me piece of mind  
The rest we can leave behind  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
You don't have to hurt yourself  
And feel so small  
It's so confusing  
And you're already there  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
So slow down  
Tell me why you're running  
And turn around  
Let it out and keep it coming  
Nothing I can do  
If I can't get to you  
Slow down  
  
Slow down

My lullaby,hung out to dry  
What's up with that  
It's over  
Where are you dad  
Mum's lookin' sad  
What's up with that  
It's dark in here  
Why bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is believing  
I used to  
My mouth is dry  
Forgot how to cry  
What's up with that  
You're hurting me  
I'm running fast  
Can't hide the past  
What's up with that  
You're pushing me  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is believing  
I used to  
I used to  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is breathing  
I saw you crawling on the floor  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is breathing  
I saw you crawling to the door  
Why , bleeding is breathing  
You're hiding , underneath the smoke in the room  
Try , bleeding is breathing  
I saw you falling on the floor

I won't say anything  
I'm hiding in the pink  
If I move would I break the spell  
Or am I boring you  
  
I can't feel anything  
I think whatever you say  
You took me riding on the big wheel  
So I guess I'm happy now  
  
And I'll stay with you  
And I'll lay with you  
And I'll always be there  
Nothing will go wrong  
Till something better comes along  
  
So now you swallowed me  
Come and finish off the rest of me  
A good house a cactus life  
Spent perfect days and sleepless nights whatever  
  
And I'll stay with you  
And I'll lay with you  
And I'll always be there  
Nothing will go wrong  
Till something better comes along  
  
And I 've lost my fingerprints  
And I 've lost my sixth sense  
But you just don't feel a thing  
When the needles going in  
  
And I'll stay with you  
And I'll lay with you  
And I'll always be there  
Oh go nowhere  
And I'll stay with you  
Till something better comes along....  
  
So now you swallowed me  
Come and finish off the rest of me

Isn't it like me  
To want to say  
Things I can't explain ...  
In simple ways?  
  
Why should I be sane?  
Why can't I be crazy?  
  
Sometimes I'm up,  
Sometimes I'm down,  
I choke on words,  
And make no sound.  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I'm weak  
Sometimes I'm strong  
Living with the fear I don't belong  
Sometimes  
  
Why is it so hard  
To know myself?  
Underneath this skin you'll find  
Someone else.  
  
Don't be so surprised  
When you look inside me  
Inside me  
  
Sometimes It's black  
Sometimes It's white  
You hide behind electric light  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I swear  
Sometimes I pray  
Suddenly the guilty disobey  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I'm weak  
Sometimes I'm strong  
Living with the fear I don't belong  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I stand  
Sometimes I fall  
I throw myself against the wall  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes I sink  
Sometimes I swim  
Tell me why my world is caving in  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes it's sweet  
Sometimes it's raw  
Trying to get so high like I did before  
Sometimes  
  
Sometimes in love  
Sometimes in hate  
Sometimes it's all a big mistake

STANDING THERE  
Have you ever been strong  
Have you ever known when it's time to walk away  
Just walk away, yeah  
Well I couldnt wait to see you  
I was listening by the phone there  
When you called  
When you called and said what you said  
All this time  
All this time with the fighting and screaming  
It's breaking me it's taken it's toll on me  
And its like where standing there  
Hand in hand  
Just waiting for the ground to give way  
Waiting for the right words to say  
So take your chance  
And don't hold back  
Cause time is all we've got around here  
Time for me to wake up and see you standing there  
You're beautiful just standing there  
Have you ever crossed the line  
Cause there's nothing I wouldn't do for love  
For this kind of love yeah  
I'm trying to reach out  
Trying to make you make you understand it  
Understand the things that I'd like between you and me cause  
All this time  
All this time with the fighting and screaming  
It's breaking me it's taken it's toll on me  
And its like where standing there  
Hand in hand  
Just waiting for the ground to give way  
Waiting for the right words to say  
So take your chance  
And don't hold back  
Cause time is all we've got around here  
Time for me to wake up and see you standing there  
You're beautiful just standing there  
  

Starting today  
I'm not gonna waste another moment  
Even if I had had the chance before  
I would have blown it  
  
But you took me by surprise  
And you caught me just in time  
  
Everyday  
You give me reason not to walk away  
I'll stop believing that the world's gone crazy  
And if it is you'll save me  
  
Starting Today  
I'm not gonna worry about tomorrow  
I'll wash away  
All this fear that's left me feeling hollow  
  
'Cause you make me want to try  
And you caught me just in time  
  
Everyday  
You give me reason not to walk away  
I've stopped believing  
I should run like crazy  
'Cause if I did you'd chase me anyway  
  
I should of told you so many times  
But I shied away  
Somehow you always seem to  
Be there making it easy  
And you give me reason to stay everyday  
  
Ooh everyday, everyday  
I've stopped believing  
I should run like crazy  
'Cause if I did you'd chase me anyway  
  
You give me reason not to walk away  
I've stopped believing  
That the world's gone crazy  
And if it is you'll save me  
  
Starting today  
I'm not gonna waste another moment

She took a walk on a Saturday  
And all of the people were gone  
The building were down and all the birds had flown away  
But she just kept singing her song  
Lazy days  
Just time and space  
Isn't it wonderful !  
  
Impossible  
To believe she's the only one  
And isn't it incredible  
In the blink of a eye it was done  
She's the girl who fell out with the sun  
And got stuck on the moon  
  
She started digging for sunshine  
And wound up with dirt in her nails  
Building her house on the edge of divine  
No wonder she never fails  
The pain is gone  
But there's no way home  
Time and space  
There's a million ways  
To feel beautiful !  
  
Impossible  
To believe she's the only one  
And isn't it incredible  
In the blink of a eye it was done  
She's the girl who fell out with the sun  
And got stuck on the moon  
  
Nothing to prove  
And what's left to stay  
When all that you know has been taken away  
Put your feet up  
Turn your problems down  
Take every day as it's coming around  
  
There's a million ways to feel  
Beautiful  
  
Impossible  
To believe she's the only one  
And isn't it incredible  
She's the girl who fell out with the sun  
Impossible  
In the blink of a eye it was done  
She's the girl who fell out with the sun  
And got stuck on the moon.

When you beat on that drum  
  
Talk in that tongue  
  
You're just scratching  
  
On the surface  
  
So tell me what it means  
  
A whisper to a scream  
  
Slowly fades away  
  
Then you wake up  
  
And tomorrow is today  
  
And you're crying  
  
Crying like a baby  
  
Caught between the tides  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
  
  
Do you know where I've been  
  
Walls are caving in  
  
It moves across a wire  
  
There no need to talk  
  
I crawl as you walk  
  
Pushing me away  
  
Then you wake up  
  
And tomorrow is today  
  
And you're crying  
  
Crying like a baby  
  
Caught between the tides  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
  
  
Flowers in the bin  
  
Close this hole I'm in  
  
Everything was one  
  
Nothing gets undone  
  
You pay the bill  
  
You lost your will  
  
Just run away until  
  
you wake up  
  
And tomorrow is today  
  
And you're crying  
  
Crying like a baby  
  
Caught between the tides  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way  
  
(Did you lose your way)  
  
You lost your way

That day, That day  
What a mess what a marvel  
I walked into that cloud again  
And I lost myself  
And I'm sad, sad, sad  
Small, alone, scared  
Craving purity  
A fragile mind and a gentle spirit  
  
That day, That day,  
What a marvelous mess  
This is all that I can do  
I'm done to be me  
Sad, scared, small, alone, beautiful  
It's supposed to be like this  
I accept everything  
It's supposed to be like this  
  
That day, That day  
I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain, sadness  
Scared, small, climbing, crawling  
Towards the light  
And it's all that I see and  
I'm tired and I'm right  
And I'm wrong  
And it's beautiful  
  
That day, That day  
What a mess, what a marvel  
We're all the same  
But no one thinks so  
And it's okay  
And I'm small and I'm divine  
And it's beautiful  
And it's coming  
And it's already here  
And it's absolutely perfect  
  
That day, That day  
When everything was a mess  
And everything was in place  
And there's too much hurt  
Sad, small, scared, alone  
And everyone's a cynic  
And it's hard and it's sweet  
But it's supposed to be like this  
  
That day, That day  
When I sat in the sun  
And I thought and I cried  
Cause I'm sad, scared, small  
Alone, strong  
And I'm nothing and I'm true  
Only a brave man can break through  
And it's all okay  
Yeah, it's okay  
  
That day, That day  
I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain, sadness  
Scared, small, climbing, crawling  
Towards the light  
And it's all that I see and  
I'm tired and I'm right  
And I'm wrong  
And it's beautiful  
  
That day, That day  
What a mess, what a marveleous mess  
We're all the same  
But no one thinks so  
And it's okay  
And I'm small and I'm divine  
And it's beautiful  
And it's coming  
And it's already here  
And it's absolutely perfect  
  
That day, That day  
That day, That day  
  
That day, That day  
When I lay down beside myself  
In this feeling of pain, sadness  
Scared, small, climbing, crawling  
Towards the light  
And it's all that I see and  
I'm tired and I'm right

That day, That day  
That day, That day  
  
So sweet, can you feel it? (Can you feel it?)  
Are you here?  
Are you with me?  
I can feel it  
And its beautiful  
  
That day, That day  
That day, absolutely perfect

Lonely, lost every part of me  
Maybe, outstayed my company  
Walking in to sad scenes  
Hold me tight and say goodbye  
I've seen, behind tomorrow's sky  
You be, my missing alibi  
Bone me over backwards  
Turn around and change my mind  
Cause I've been thinking  
About our world tonight  
Slowly sinking into my appetite  
Tomorrow morning  
Are you a friend of mine  
I swear, you've left me open  
Nowhere, to hide this moment  
Overcrowded daydreams  
We're lost or so it seems  
Cause I've been thinking  
About our world tonight  
Slowly sinking into my appetite  
Tomorrow morning  
Are you a friend of mine  
Cause I've been thinking  
About our world tonight  
Slowly sinking into my appetite  
Tomorrow morning  
Are you a friend of mine  

I thought I saw a man brought to life  
He was warm, he came around like  
He was dignified  
He showed me what it was to cry  
Well you couldn't be that man I adored  
You don't seem to know, don't seem to care  
What your heart is for  
No I don't know him anymore  
  
There's nothin' where we used to lie  
Conversation has run dry  
That's what's going on  
Nothing's fine  
  
I'm torn  
I'm all out of faith  
This is how I feel  
I'm cold and I'm shamed  
Lying naked on the floor  
Illusion never changed  
Into something real  
I'm wide awake  
And I can see the perfect sky is torn  
You're a little late  
I'm already torn  
  
So I guess the fortune teller's right  
I should have seen just what was there  
And not some holy light  
But you crawled beneath my veins  
And now I don't care  
I have no luck  
I don't miss it all that much  
There's just so many things  
That I can't touch  
  
I'm torn  
I'm all out of faith  
This is how I feel  
I'm cold and I'm shamed  
Lying naked on the floor  
Illusion never changed  
Into something real  
I'm wide awake  
And I can see the perfect sky is torn  
You're a little late  
I'm already torn  
  
There's nothing where he used to lie  
My inspiration has run dry  
That's what is goin' on  
Nothin's right  
  
I'm torn  
I'm all out of faith  
This is how I feel  
I'm cold and I am shamed  
Lying naked on the floor  
Illusion never changed  
Into something real  
I'm wide awake  
And I can see the perfect sky is torn  
You're a little late  
I'm already torn

Twenty cities, it passed me by  
Finding treasures I don't wanna find  
But I have stolen and I've cross the line  
And I want you, I want you  
Twenty seconds and you could be gone  
You shine brighter than the morning sun  
You think it's over but it'd just begun  
And I want you, I want you  
  
This sky is grey, it's full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
I'll drink it up and take it slow  
I don't need anything else  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
  
Twenty questions ringing in my head  
The moment's over but it's never dead  
What did I say and what does all this meant  
'Cause I want you, I want you  
Fire light as it hit you right  
Heads are turned as you walk on by  
Maybe we belong in another time  
I still want you, I want you  
  
This sky is grey, it's full of gold  
Can feel your heart and feel your soul  
I drink it up and take it slow  
I don't need anything else  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
  
How many things can you wish for?  
'Cause just wishing is all I do  
When it comes to you  
How many lives can you live through?  
How many times can you keep movin', keep movin'  
  
Tell me where I'm heading  
Tell me I could be this sane  
Somewhere I've forgotten  
I die a little more for you  
When everything is broken  
There's piece I'll never lose  
I keep finding reasons to  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you  
Die a little more for you

A round of applause, you got what you want  
Take a good look at what you give up  
Because I'm telling you  
A heart can't be unbroken, oh, oh  
  
And can you remember how I kiss you  
Recall the sweet taste in your mouth  
'Cause baby, the memory is all you get now  
And I'm moving, moving, moving on  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
Does every morning make you happy?  
And tell me do you laugh yourself to sleep?  
I hope you find it's easy to forget me, oh, oh  
  
I hope you don't feel anything when you see me  
I wonder if you're out there having fun  
I hope you get all that you really wanted  
'Cause I'm moving, moving, moving on  
  
Don't you see the light has changed  
And nothing looks the same  
Just shadows on the ground  
And if you listen carefully you'll hear the sound  
  
All that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
I hope you get all that you want  
'Cause I didn't  
(All that you want)  
'Cause I didn't  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
('Cause I didn't)  
All that you want  
  
All that you want  
All that you want  
All that you want  
('Cause I didn't)

All my stars are upside down  
And you're there when I turn around  
I don't wanna be on my own  
And I don't wanna bring you down  
I just can't figure out  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello  
  
When you touch down, remember this  
The more you leave behind  
The more I miss  
I don't wanna fall asleep  
And I don't wanna wake alone  
I just can't work it out  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello  
  
Did you have to go, I don't wanna see you leave  
What good of memories, distance stretch further with the time  
Every time I close my eyes, you're fight off the sunrise  
Now we're voices down the line, tell me, tell me why  
  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When you're gone and I have nothing you know  
I don't wanna say goodbye  
When there's heaven in hello, when you're gone  
So long, I don't know  
What's the good in goodbye?  
When there are no reasons why  
When there's heaven in hello  
I'll never know why you have to go

The sun came up  
Desperate, desperate  
The stars above  
Held you back once again  
  
Half way here  
Half way here  
They whisper  
You talk so much sense  
  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery when you're sleeping  
  
I saw your tears  
Violet, violet  
And it's been years  
The skies been crying for you  
  
I found out beautiful things about you  
You talk so much sense  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping  
  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When you're sleeping  
  
So you go and wonder  
Where you wander  
Lose yourself to  
Take us higher  
And I'll be waiting  
For you when you're down  
  
You talk so much sense  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When you're sleeping  
  
You talk so much sense  
When you're sleeping  
When you're sleeping  
And you share all the secrets  
And the mystery  
When you're sleeping

The sky has fallen on my yesterday  
I watch my moon and blue sun (?) slip away  
Everybody's asking questions  
Everybody's wanting more  
Every time I catch myself, I fall  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why i don't know  
And i try to pull myself togehter  
I don't want to go home (?)  
  
The little girl has lost her way today  
The tables turning on the game she plays  
Everybody's asking questions  
Everybody's wanting more  
Every time I catch myself, I fall  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why I don't know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I don't want to go home  
  
Every time I catch myself, I fall  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why I don't know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I don't want to go home  
  
And it's why you ask me  
And it's why I don't know  
And I try to pull myself together  
I don't want to go home  
  
Every time I catch myself, I (slip away) fall . . .

Calling out, calling out  
Have you ever wondered  
Why I'm always alone when you're in my dreams  
Calling out, calling out  
Have you ever wondered  
What we could have been if you'd only let me in  
  
I want you, but I want you to understand  
I need you I love you  
  
Didn't want to leave you with the wrong impression  
Didn't want to leave you with my last confession,  
Yeah, of love  
Wasn't tryin' to pull you in the wrong direction  
All I want to do is try to make a connection yeah  
  
Fallng out, fallin' out  
Have you ever wondered, if this was ever more  
Than a crazy idea  
Falling out, falling out  
Have you ever wondered  
  
I want you, but I want you to understand  
I need I love you  
  
Didn't want to leave you with the wrong impression  
Didn't want to leave you with my last confession,  
Yeah, of love  
Wasn't tryin' to pull you in the wrong direction  
All I want to do is try to make a connection yeah

Back track, listen, stop that  
Before everything is lost again  
You lied, oh why  
Stand back, give is slack  
You don't know where my head is at  
You're in too deep, don't try  
  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't need, I don't need what you up to  
Better step down, better turn around, no  
Better row out, here's a bow now move  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to no  
  
You grab never give back  
And think I don't think through that  
I do, I'm onto you  
Too far, pushin' your luck  
Get out, it's the end of the line  
For you and now you're mine  
  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't need, I don't need what you up to  
Better step down, better turn around, go  
Better row out, here's a bow now move  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to no  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
  
Stand back, give it slack  
You don't know where my head is at  
I do, I'm onto you  
  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't need, I don't need what you up to  
Better step down, better turn around, go  
Better row out, here's a bow now move  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to  
I don't want, I don't want what you up to
