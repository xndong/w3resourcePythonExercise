You're looking for a way out  
I can feel it  
Come on, show me where it hurts  
Maybe I can heal it  
  
Your feelings are your own  
Now you keep 'em under lock and key  
You got me drivin' through the streets  
For an answer to the mystery  
  
The world's still weak on Charleston Avenue  
Outside that vacant Starlight Motel I see you  
Laughing with your girlfriends  
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind  
  
It was a matter of time  
  
There's a panic in this house and it's bound to surface  
Just walkin' through the front door makes me nervous  
It's creepin' up the floorboards, got me wondering where I stand  
I cannot put out the fire, I got a book of matches in my hand  
  
When we first met, headstrong and filled with doubt  
Made just enough hustling tables that summer to take you out  
I was fallin' back on forever when you told me about your heart  
You laid it on the line  
  
Laughing with your girlfriends  
Not a care in the world, not a burden on your mind  
(You laid it on the line)  
  
It was just a matter, It was a matter of time  
  
We found ourselves  
We belong in it forever  
Ain't that what it's all about?  
Make the promise and keep it  
Come hell or high water  
We'd figure it out  
  
It was the night, it was the moon  
It was the green grass in the garden  
The victory and the sin  
  
I know you're weary, look at me  
Flailin' in the corner  
Here's the towel  
Go on, throw it in  
  
It was a matter of time  
Can't you see that it's tearing me up inside?  
Look what's laying at our feet  
That's the wreckage of broken dreams  
And burned out hales  
And it's here on our street

On the field I remember you were incredible  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
On the field I remember you were incredible  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
  
On the match with the boys, you think you're all alone  
With the pain that you drain from love  
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world  
Cause Andy, you're a star  
  
Leave your number on the locker and I'll give you a call  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
Leave your legacy in gold on the plaques that line the hall  
Hey shut up, hey shut up, yeah  
  
On the streets, such a sweet face jumping in town  
In the staff when the verdict is in  
In a car with a girl, promise me she's not your world  
Cause Andy, you're a star  
In nobody's eyes but mine  
Andy, you're a star  
In nobody's eyes but mine  
Andy, you're a star  
In nobody's eyes  
In nobody's eyes but mine

I did my best to notice, when the call came down the line  
Up to the platform of surrender, I was brought but I was kind  
And sometimes I get nervous when I see an open door  
Close your eyes, clear your heart... Cut the cord  
  
Are we human, or are we dancer  
My sign is vital, my hands are cold  
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer  
Are we human, or are we dancer  
  
Pay my respects to grace and virtue, send my condolences to good  
Give my regards to soul and romance, they always did the best they could  
And so long to devotion you taught me everything I know  
Wave good bye, wish me well, you gotta let me go  
  
Are we human, or are we dancer  
My sign is vital, my hands are cold  
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer  
Are we human, or are we dancer  
  
Will your system be alright?  
When you dream of home tonight  
There is no message we're receiving  
Let me know, is your heart still beating?  
  
Are we human, or are we dancer  
My sign is vital, my hands are cold  
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer...  
You've gotta let me know  
  
Are we human, or are we dancer  
My sign is vital my hands are cold  
And I'm on my knees looking for the answer  
Are we human... Or are we dancer  
  
Are we human, or are we dancer  
Are we human, or are we dancer

Be still  
And go on to bed  
Nobody knows what lies ahead  
And life is short  
To say the least  
We're in the belly of the beast  
  
Be still  
Wild and young  
Long may your innocence reign  
Like shells on the shore  
And may your limits be unknown  
And may your efforts be your own  
If you ever feel you can't take it anymore  
  
Don't break character  
You've got a lot of heart  
Is this real or just a dream?  
Rise up like the sun  
Labor till the work is done  
  
Be still  
One day you'll leave  
Fearlessness on your sleeve  
When you've come back, tell me what did you see  
What did you see (what did you see)  
Was there something out there for me?  
  
Be still  
Close your eyes  
Soon enough you'll be on your own  
Steady and straight  
And if they drag you through the mud  
It doesn't change what's in your blood  
(Over chains, over chains, over ?, over ?)  
When they knock you down  
  
Don't break character  
You've got a lot of heart  
Is this real or just a dream?  
Be still  
Be still  
Be still  
Be still  
  
Over rock and chain  
Over sunset plain  
Over trap and snare  
When you're in too deep  
In your wildest dream  
In your made up scheme  
When they knock you down  
When they knock you down  
  
Don't break character  
You've got so much heart  
Is this real or just a dream?  
Oh Rise up like the sun  
And labor till the work is  
Rise up like the sun  
Labor till the work is done

Believe me, Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance to find  
A go-go dance to disco now  
Please believe me, Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance to find  
A go-go dance to disco now  
  
Forget what they said in Soho  
Leave the oh-no's out  
And believe me, Natalie  
Listen Natalie  
This is your last chance  
  
There is an old cliche  
Under your Monet painting  
Remember the arch of roses  
Right above your couch  
Forget what they said in Soho  
Leave the oh-no's out  
Yes, there is an old cliche  
Under your Monet painting  
You left the station now to the floor  
With speculation, what was it for?  
In that old hallway  
Moses, why don't you say  
You've been away for a long time  
  
Believe me, Natalie  
This is your last chance  
To find a go-go  
Forget what they said in Soho  
And walk away  
If my dreams for us can't get you through  
Just one more day  
It's alright by me  
  
God help me somehow  
There's no time for survival left  
The time is now...  
Cause this might be your last chance  
To disco, oh-oh

No more trouble,  
In this town.  
Silent night, for a change.  
  
Brand new year,  
Coming up ahead.  
You know its been so long,  
Since I rang one in?  
  
I close my eyes,  
Think about the path I took.  
Just when I think these times,  
Have gotten the best of me.  
  
I can see my mother in the kitchen.  
My father on the floor,  
Watching television.  
It's a wonderful life.  
  
Cinnamon candles burning.  
Snowball fights outside.  
Smile below each nose and above each chin.  
  
Stomp my boots before I go back in.  
  
I wasted my wishes,  
On Saturday nights.  
Boy what I would give,  
For just one more.  
  
I soften my heart  
  
Shocked the world.  
Do you hear my voice?  
Do you know my name?  
Light my way,  
Lift my head.  
Light my way, I can see my mother in the kitchen.  
  
My father on the floor,  
Watching television.  
It's a wonderful life.  
  
Cinnamon candles burning.  
Snowball fights outside.  
Smile below each nose and above each chin.  
  
Family all together.  
Presents piled high.  
Frost on all the windows,  
What a wonderful night.  
  
Cinnamon candles burning.  
Snowball fights outside.  
Smile below each nose and above each chin.  
  
So happy they found me,  
Love was all around me.  
Stomp my boots before I go back in.

Let me out  
Don't tell me everything  
Start it out  
Like any other day  
Must have gave the wrong impression  
Don't you understand where I belong?  
I'm not the one  
  
Stand again  
They say nothing comes for free  
And that's the truth  
I've been living in a fantasy  
Slip and slide ahead trip heaven  
Self-denial is such a wonderful and powerful thing  
But I'm not the one  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home, I'm not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights  
Carry me home, don't let me fade away  
  
Stop the press the kids light is growing dim  
It took a month long slide, then the world came caving in  
When you self-destruct you wind up looking for a glimmer of hope  
But the writing's on the wall  
I'm not the one  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home, I'm not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights  
Carry me home, don't let me fade  
  
Just how thick is your skin? (away)  
Just how sharp are your teeth?  
Oh, you've got a lot to learn  
Is there somewhere else that I can win  
Is there something else to start over again  
From the summit's edge to the cutting room floor  
I will be afraid no more (no more)  
  
The morning dove sings with two broken wings  
Carry me home, I'm not afraid  
The stars in my eyes with shimmering lights (with shimmering lights)  
Carry me home, don't let me fade  
Carry me home, carry me

Racy days  
Help me through the hopeless haze  
But my oh my  
Tragic eyes  
I can't even recognize myself behind  
So if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind  
  
Out again, a siren screams at half past ten  
And you won't let go  
While I ignore, that we both felt like this  
Before it starts to show  
So if I had a chance  
Would you let me know  
  
Why aren't you shaking  
Step back in time  
Graciously taking  
Oh your too kind  
  
And if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind  
  
We're all the same  
And love is blind  
The sun is gone  
Before it shines  
  
And I said if the answer is no  
Can I change your mind

I'll tell you what you wanna know,  
But boy you better listen close.  
People gonna tell you lies,  
Don't let it come as a surprise.  
  
That woman's on my back again,  
I know she's got the best intentions.  
When you begin to realize,  
You know you got your daddy's eyes.  
  
And there's something that I want to say,  
I love her, too.  
And all of this has got nothing to do with you.  
  
And I'd like to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me.  
  
When you put it on the other hand,  
  
When you're old enough to understand.  
That glove will bring it all to life,  
I didn't say that made it right.  
  
Because that woman's on my back again,  
I know she's got the best intentions.  
When you begin to realize,  
You know you got your daddy's eyes.  
  
And there's something that I want to say,  
I love her, too.  
And all of this has got nothing to do with you.  
  
And I'd like to stay but I can't because

And I'd like to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me.  
  
And sometimes people get tired,  
And I woke up a little too late to lie.  
  
Dreams should last a long time,  
This is not what I'd call goodbye.  
  
And I'd like to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me.  
  
And I'd love to stay but I can't because  
I've been fooling around and I know  
That you called because you never even knew  
That it was hurting me, me.  
  
I love her, too.

That place we all run to  
It can come down on you  
The expectation can be great  
  
If you should ever tire  
Or if you should require  
A sudden, simple twist of fate  
  
Don't hide away  
There's something to be said for pushing through  
We'd never ride on horses that discourage you  
  
If you should fall upon hard times  
If you should lose your way  
There is a place  
Here in this house  
That you can stay  
  
If you should find romance  
Go on and take that chance  
Before the strategies begin  
  
Deadlines and commitments  
Every morning  
And in the evening  
They can suck you in  
Boy, don't I know it  
  
This offer would be standing  
All you've got to do is call  
Don't be afraid to knock on the door  
  
If you should fall upon hard times  
If you should lose your way  
There is a place  
Here in this house  
That you can stay  
  
I'm not talking about  
Deadlines and commitments  
Sold out of confusion  
There is a place  
Here in this house  
That you can stay  
  
Catch you, darling  
I'll be waiting  
I am on your side  
  
This offer would be standing

I'll be waiting  
I am on your side

Oh, Santa  
I've been waiting on you  
That's funny kid  
Because I've been coming for you  
Oh, Santa  
I've been killing just for fun  
Well, the party is over kid  
Because I, because I got a bullet in my gun  
A bullet in your what  
(Santa's got a bullet in his gun, you know it)  
(Santa's got a bullet in his gun)  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
I've been a clean living boy  
I promise you, did every little thing you ask me to  
I can't believe the things I'm going through  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the block they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy  
Oh, Santa  
It's been a real hard year  
There just ain't no getting around this  
Life is hard but look at me I turned out alright  
Hey, Santa  
Why don't we talk about it, work it out  
Believe me, this ain't what I wanted  
I love all you kids, you know that, hell  
I remember when you were just 10 years old  
Playing out in the desert  
Just waiting for a sip of that  
Sweet Mojave rain  
In the sweet Mojave rain  
The boy was on his own  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
I've been a clean living boy  
I promise you, did every little thing you ask me to  
I can't believe the things I'm going through  
Hey, Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the block they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy  
They had it coming, so, why can't you see  
I couldn't turn my check no longer  
The sun is going down and Christmas is near  
Just look the other way and I'll disappear forever  
Don't shoot me Santa Clause  
No one else around believes me  
But the children on the street they tease me  
I couldn't let them off that easy  
Believe me Santa, Santa  

I believe in you and me  
I'm coming to find you  
If it takes me all night  
Wrong until you make it right  
And I won't forget you  
At least I'll try  
And run, and run tonight  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
  
I wasn't shopping for a doll  
To say the least, I thought, I've seen them all  
But then you took me by surprise  
I'm dreaming bout those dreamy eyes  
I never knew, I never knew  
So take your suitcase, cause I don't mind  
And baby doll, I meant it every time  
You don't need to compromise  
I'm dreaming bout those dreamy eyes  
I never knew, I never knew  
But it's alright  
  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright  
Everything will be alright

I've gone through life white-knuckled  
In the moments that left me behind  
Refusing to heed the yield  
I penetrate the force fields in the blind  
They say I'll adjust  
God knows I must  
But I'm not sure how  
This natural selection picked me out to be  
A dark horse running in a fantasy  
  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time,  
(Flesh and bone)  
  
Somewhere outside that finish line  
I square up and break through the chains  
And I hit like a raging bull  
Anointed by the blood, I take the reins  
Cut from the cloth, of a flag that  
Bears the name of "Battle Born"  
They'll call me the contender  
They'll listen for the bell  
With my face flashing crimson from the fires of hell  
  
(What are you afraid of?)  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time,  
(Flesh and bone)  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
Man, I'm turning on a dime,  
(Flesh and bone)  
  
(This could decay)  
This could decay  
Like the valley below  
Defenses are down  
The stakes are high (scouting the crowd for a face of compassion)  
The fairytale end (to face off the journey that fathers no more)  
The staggering blow (you'll find the truth in the roots of desire)  
You lead with your chin(thinkin' with your corners, just a compass and the
sun)  
This could be real(thinkin' with your corners, just a)  
Simple  
  
And what are you made of?  
(Flesh and bone)  
And I'm running out of time  
(Flesh and bone)  
What are you made of?  
  
He faces forward,  
Trading in his blindness for the world of love,  
And time is raging, may it rage in vain,  
And you always had it, but you never knew,  
So boots and saddles, get on your feet,  
There's no surrender, cause there's no retreat,  
The bells are sounding, bring this match to an end,  
We are the descendants of giant men

I pack my case, I check my face  
I look a little bit older  
I look a little bit colder  
With one deep breath, and one big step  
I move a little bit closer, I move a little bit closer  
For reasons unknown  
  
I caught my stride, I flew and flied  
I know if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind  
Well, my heart - it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to  
And my eyes - they don't see you no more  
And my lips - they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you no more  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
  
It was an open chair  
We sat down in the open chair  
I said, if destiny's kind, I've got the rest on my mind  
But my heart - it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to  
And my eyes - they don't see you no more  
And my lips - they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you at all  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
  
I said, my heart - it don't beat, it don't beat the way it used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you no more  
And my lips - they don't kiss, they don't kiss the way they used to  
And my eyes don't recognize you no more  
  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown  
For reasons unknown

Your class, your caste, your country, sect, your name or your tribe  
There's people always dying trying to keep them alive  
There's bodies decomposing in containers tonight  
In an abandoned building where  
Squatters made a mural of a Mexican girl  
With fifteen cans of spray paint and a chemical swirl  
She's standing in the ashes at the end of the world  
Four winds blowing through her hair  
  
But when great Satan's gone... the Whore of Babylon...  
She just can't sustain the pressure where it's placed  
She caves, She caves  
  
The Bible's blind, the Torah's deaf, the Qur'an's mute  
If you burned them all together you'd get close to the truth still  
They're pouring over Sanskrit on the Ivy League moons  
While shadows lengthen in the sun  
Cast all the school and meditation built to soften the times  
And hold us at the center while the spiral unwinds  
It's knocking over fences crossing property lines  
Four Winds, cry until it comes  
  
And it's the Sum of Man slouching towards Bethlehem  
A heart just can't contain all of that empty space  
It breaks. It breaks. It breaks.  
  
Well I went back by rented Cadillac and company jet  
Like a newly orphaned refugee retracing my steps  
All the way to Cassadaga to commune with the dead  
They said, "You'd better look alive"  
And I was off to old Dakota where a genocide sleeps  
In the Black Hills, the Badlands, the calloused East  
I buried my ballast. I made my peace.  
  
Heard Four Winds, leveling the pines  
  
But when great Satan's gone... the Whore of Babylon...  
She just can't remain with all that outer space  
She breaks. She breaks. She caves. She caves.  
She breaks.  
  
You better look alive

A little birdie whispered in my ear  
You've been cooking up a world of fear  
Put your hands in things you shouldn't have known  
You was riding in the danger zone  
  
Well you had us all fooled with your quarterback smile  
And your crocodile tears there for a while  
And my paradigm shifted, man you're making me shout  
  
Hey, from here from out  
Friends are gonna be hard to come by  
Left us wonderin' what it all was about  
He had it easy, man he chose the hard way  
Walk that old, lonely road in the shadow of a doubt  
From here on out  
  
Should our paths ever decide to cross  
You may wonder what the trouble cost  
That don't matter now, life goes on  
Hallelujah, the troubles' gone  
  
No sense in holding purpose and it's better to forgive  
These are things that I must learn, to practice while I live  
And my paradigm shifted, man you're making me shout  
  
Hey, from here from out  
Friends are gonna be hard to come by  
Left us wonderin' what it all was about  
He had it easy, man he chose the hard way  
Walk that old, lonely road in the shadow of a doubt  
  
Hey, from here on out  
Let the bugle blow a song of peace time  
Left us wonderin' what it all was about  
You may deny it but you carry it with you  
Down that old lonely road in the shadow of a doubt  
Yeah, from here on out

Sitting here on the bed,  
Trying to clear my head,  
But Brooke you just won't budge,  
So I look back instead,  
Why'd you go away?  
Useless when I say,  
Hey,  
Baby I'll be the best  
'Cause I'm a jealous mess,  
So wash your hands from all this dirt,  
And take my words for what they're worth,  
Baby I'll be the best,  
But you stand to protest,  
And my stomach has been so abused,  
Your confusions got me so confused,  
But everything will be alright  
If I get trashed tonight.  
Sitting here on the bed,

Glamorous  
Indie rock'n'roll is what I want  
It's in my soul, it's what I need  
Indie rock'n'roll, it's time  
Two of us  
Flipping through a thrift store magazine  
She plays the drums, I'm on tambourine  
Bet your bottom dollar on me  
  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's all I need  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
  
In a clutch  
I'm talking every word for all the boys  
Electric girls with worn down toys  
Make it up, break it up, what do you care  
Oh what do you care?  
  
I take my twist with a shout  
A coffee shop with a cause, then I'll freak you out  
No sex, no drugs, no rock, no roll  
  
When it comes today  
  
Stay if you wanna love me, stay  
Oh don't be shy, let's cause a scene  
Like lovers do on silver screens  
Let's make it yeah, we'll cause a scene  
  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
It's all I need  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
  
In a clutch  
I'm talking every word for all the boys  
It's all I need  
Make it up, break it up, what do you care  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me  
  
Two of us, flipping through a thrift store magazine  
It's all I need  
Makin' up, breakin' up, what do you care?  
It's indie rock'n'roll for me...

The unknown distance to the great beyond  
Stares back at my grieving frame  
To cast my shadow by the holy sun  
My spirit moans with a sacred pain  
And it's quiet now  
The universe is standing still  
  
[Chorus]  
There's nothing I can say  
There's nothing we can do now  
There's nothing I can say  
There's nothing we can do now  
  
And all that stands between the souls release  
This temporary flesh and bone  
We know that it's over now  
I feel my faded mind begin to roam  
  
Every time you fall  
And every time you try  
Every foolish dream  
And every compromise  
Every word you spoke  
And everything you said  
Everything you left me, rambles in my head  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Up above the world so high  
  
And everything you loved  
And every time you try  
Everybody's watching  
Everybody cry  
  
Stay, don't leave me  
The stars can't for your sign  
Don't signal now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Goodnight, travel well  
Goodnight, travel well  
  
And there's nothing I can say  
There's nothing I can do now

Looking out my window  
An angel in robes appeared and nearly pulled me apart  
A million miles of freedom, a million miles of road,  
But I still don't know where to start  
  
She wrote her number down  
And she gave it to me  
They had to scrape me off the floor  
In this transient town, waiters and dealers  
Trying to get their foot in the door  
  
That night I called her and she said  
"Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in the world"  
And I said to her  
"Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl"  
  
I can see the time drippin' down the clock,  
We've been trying to hear that ancient refrain  
It's the one that knows just when our heads are down  
And reminds us of the place from where we came  
Where we came  
  
"Daddy daddy daddy, all my life  
I've been trying to find my place in this world"  
"Baby baby babe, I got all night to listen to the heart of a girl"  
  
What happened here, what is this world?  
It's too far from the heart of a girl  
A ripple in the water  
From the drop of a pearl  
I'm on the shore waitin'  
For the heart of a girl  
  
Many doors, knock on one  
Standin' still, time is raging  
Staring down the mouth of a hundred thousand guns  
And you're still here, you're still here  
  
I believe that we never have to be alone  
Yes I believe it's just around the bend  
You can hold it in  
Or you can scream it on a microphone  
There is no end (there is no end)  
There is no end (there is no end)  
  
And, deep in the night, I feel the presence  
Of something that was long ago told to me  
There is a hand, guiding the river  
The river to wide open sea  
And deep in my heart, in and again  
On any mountain, no I'm not afraid  
Standing on stone, you stand beside me  
And honor the plans that were made

Wheels are turning  
I remember when you were mine  
Now just to reach you  
Baby, I'd stand in line  
  
But there's another world  
We're living in  
Tonight  
  
And there's another heart  
That's fading in  
The light  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Don't want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Spent the summer, just laying out in the sun  
Time seems to move so slow  
When you're taking it as it comes  
Maybe we were just too young  
  
Your body was tanned and your hair was long  
You showed me your smile and my cares were gone  
Falling in love filled my soul with fright  
You said "Come on babe, it'll be alright"  
I must have been a fool to the bitter end  
Now I hold on to hope to have you back again  
I'd bargain and I'd fight  
  
But there's another world  
We're living in  
Tonight  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
I don't want your memory  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Well I saw you in a restaurant  
The other day  
And instead of walking towards you  
I ran away  
And I'll keep on waiting for you  
Till you'll come around  
Come around and say  
  
Don't want your picture  
On my cell phone  
I want you here with me  
Don't need those memories  
In my head now  
I want you here with me  
  
Ooh!  
Ooh!  
Here with me  
Ooh!  
Ooh!  
Ooh!  
Here with me

The Killers  
Well your eyes just haven?t been the same, Joseph  
Are you bad at dealing with the fame, Joseph  
There?s a pale moonshine, above you  
Do you see both sides, do they shove you, around  
Elton John  
Is the touchstone forcing you to hide, Joseph  
Are the rumors eating you alive, Joseph  
The Killers  
When the holy night is upon you  
Will you do what?s right, the position is yours  
Elton John  
From the temple walls to the New York night  
Our decisions rest on a child  
When she took her stand  
Did she hold your hand  
Will your faith stand still or run away  
Run away  
guitar solo  
Elton John  
When they've driven you so far  
That you think you're gonna drop  
Do you wish you were back there at the carpenter shop  
Neil Tennant  
With the plane and the lathe  
The work never drove you mad  
You're a maker, a creator  
Not just somebody's dad  
From the temple walls to the New York night  
Our decisions rest on a man  
When I take the stand  
When I take the stand  
Will he hold my hand  
Will my faith stand still or run away  
(run away)  
Elton John  
And the desert  
It's a hell of a place to find heaven  
Forty years lost in the wilderness looking for God  
And you climb to the top of the mountain  
Looking down on the city  
Where you were born  
(On the years since you left gave you time to sit back and reflect)  
Better you than me (Better you than me)  
Better you than me  
Yes  
The Killers  
Well the Holy night is upon you (Better you than me 2x)  
Do you see both sides, do they shove you, around  
Better you than me, Joseph (Better you than me)  
Better you than me  
Joseph, Joseph, Joseph, Joseph  
Than me  
Better you than me  
Better you than me (Better you, better you, better you)  
Than me  
Well your eyes just haven?t been the same, Joseph  

Last time I said I was in control  
I had 25 debts and we both know  
When you come back now  
You'll see my face  
I said 25 debts and we both pray  
  
While I move away  
Hard times don't come until tomorrow  
These eyes don't see  
Take your skin off when you listen to me  
Move away  
Hard times don't come until tomorrow  
These eyes in me  
Take your skin off when you're talkin' to me  
Me...  
  
Oh what a world that we both come in  
I said hold it to the rock and let it in  
Oh what a world that we are in  
I said hold it to the rock and we're both in  
  
While I move away  
Hard times don't come until tomorrow  
These eyes don't see  
Take your skin off when you listen to me  
Move away  
Hard times don't come until tomorrow  
These eyes don't see  
Take your skin off when you're listenin' to me  
  
Don't worry bout what might have been  
Just tell your woman that you're sorry  
And you jumped out of your skin  
Listen closely to your motto  
Don't worry bout what might have been  
Tell the jury that you're sorry  
And just jump out of your skin  
I wanna jump out of my skin  
I wanna jump out of my skin  
And watch the clouds  
  
Move away  
I'm never gonna live it down  
Move away  
Move away  
Move move move move away  
Move away  
  
Move away  
Hard times don't come until tomorrow  
These eyes don't see  
Take your skin off when you listen to me  
Move away  
Hard times don't come until tomorrow  
Move away  
Move away  
Move away  
Move away

Coming out of my cage  
And I've been doin' just fine  
Gotta gotta be down  
Because I want it all  
It started out with a kiss  
How did it end up like this?  
It was only a kiss  
It was only a kiss  
Now I'm falling asleep  
And she's calling a cab  
While he's having a smoke  
And she's taking a drag  
Now they're going to bed  
And my stomach is sick  
And it's all in my head  
But she's touching his chest now  
He takes off her dress now  
Let me go  
And I just can't look  
It's killing me  
And taking control  
Jealousy  
Turning saints into the sea  
Swimming through sick lullabies  
Choking on your alibis  
But it's just the price I pay  
Destiny is calling me  
Open up my eager eyes  
Cus I'm Mr. Brightside  
  
I'm coming out of my cage  
And I've been doin' just fine  
Gotta gotta be down  
Because I want it all  
It started out with a kiss  
How did it end up like this?  
It was only a kiss  
It was only a kiss  
Now I'm falling asleep  
And she's calling a cab  
While he's having a smoke  
And she's taking a drag  
Now they're going to bed  
And my stomach is sick  
And it's all in my head  
But she's touching his chest now  
He takes off her dress now  
Let me go  
Cus I just can't look  
It's killing me  
And taking control  
Jealousy  
Turning saints into the sea  
Swimming through sick lullabies  
Choking on your alibis  
But it's just the price I pay  
Destiny is calling me  
Open up my eager eyes  
Cus I'm Mr. Brightside  
  
I never  
I never  
I never  
I never

Let me wrap myself around you  
You'll show me how I see it  
And when you come back in from nowhere  
Do you ever think of me?  
Your heart, not able  
Let me show you how much I care  
I need those eyes to tide me over  
I'll take your picture when I go  
Gives me strength and gives me patience  
But I'll never let you know  
I got nothing on you, babe  
But I always said I'll try  
Let me show you  
How much I care  
Sometimes it gets hard  
Don't you know?  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
Don't give the ghost up  
Just clench your fist  
You should know by now  
You were on my list  
  
Your heart, not able  
Your ways - they're not able  
Let me show you  
How much I care  
Sometimes it gets hard  
And don't ya know?  
  
[Chorus x 3]  
  
When you rock and roll with me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
When you rock and roll with me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be

Memories erased, not forgotten.  
Rewond and recorded over.  
Gone so no one will see, gone so I can never be.  
The same!  
  
Waters all over these pages.  
It's not true, there locked in cages.  
I see how but to blind to see why.  
Now it's gone.  
  
Summer won't stop chewing my blanket.  
Can you stop the pain from into the night?  
  
Waters all over these pages.  
It's not true, there locked in cages.  
I see how but to blind to see why.  
Now it's gone.  
  
The silence just hurts, the silence just hurts.  
Take it away, away, away.  
Can you stop the pain from into the night?  
  
Waters all over these pages.  
It's not true, there locked in cages.  
I see how but to blind to see why.  
Now it's gone.

Oh no, oh no oo oo  
I'm going to be left out  
I'm going to break you  
And if you only knew just how I took my time  
I'm going to take it off, I am going to make you  
I gotta dance, gotta dance  
Gotta seem all right  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way I'm going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy  
  
Oh oh oh oooohhhhhh  
  
I'm going to see it all, I am going to stay to  
I'm want to take it down, and make it go away  
And if you see my soul, I'm going make you  
I going see, I gotta see, gotta be ok  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way I'm going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy  
  
[Guitar Solo]  
  
Oh Yeah and By The Way I'm going to make you cry  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy  
  
18 with a face like that,  
Kick it twice in the eye  
And don't you go home to Daddy  
  
Oh no oh no oh oo oo  
Yeah who!  
Oh no oh no oh oo oo

Remember Rio and get down  
Like some other DJ, in some other town  
She's been trying to tell me to hold tight  
But I've been waiting this whole night  
  
But I've been down across the road or two  
But now I've found the velvet sun  
That shines on me and you  
  
In the back, uh huh, I can't crack  
We're on top  
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh  
I can't fake, we're on top  
We're on top  
  
The day is breaking, we're still here  
Your body's shaking, and it's clear  
You really need it, so let go  
And let me feed it, but you know  
  
That I've been down across the road or two  
But now I've found the velvet sun  
That shines on me and you  
  
In the back, uh huh, I can't crack  
We're on top  
It's just a shimmy and a shake, uh huh  
I can't fake, we're on top  
We're on top  
We bring the bump to the grind, uh huh  
I don't mind, we're on top  
It's just a shimmy and a shack, uh huh  
I can't fake, we're on top  
We're on top  
  
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight  
So get your eyes off my bride tonight  
Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight  
  
It's like a cigarette in the mouth  
Or a handshake in the doorway  
I look at you and smile because I'm fine  
  
And we don't mean to satisfy tonight  
So get your eyes off my bride tonight  
Cause I don't need to satisfy tonight  
  
It's like a cigarette in the mouth  
Or a handshake in the doorway  
I look at you and smile because I'm fine

On the corner of main street  
Just tryin' to keep it in line  
You say you wanna move on, and  
You say I'm falling behind  
  
Can you read my mind?  
Can you read my mind?  
  
I never really gave up on  
Breakin' out of this two-star town  
I got the green light  
I got a little fight  
I'm gonna turn this thing around  
  
Can you read my mind?  
Can you read my mind?  
  
The good old days, the honest man  
The restless heart, the Promised Land  
A subtle kiss that no one sees  
A broken wrist and a big trapeze  
  
Oh well, I don't mind, you don't mind  
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine  
Before you go, can you read my mind?  
  
It's funny how you just break down  
Waiting on some sign  
I pull up to the front of your driveway  
With magic soaking my spine  
  
Can you read my mind?  
Can you read my mind?  
  
The teenage queen, the loaded gun  
The drop dead dream, the Chosen One  
A southern drawl, the world unseen  
A city wall and a trampoline  
  
Oh well, I don't mind, you don't mind  
'Cause I don't shine if you don't shine  
Before you jump  
Tell me what you find  
When you read my mind  
  
Slipping in my faith until I fall  
He never returned that call  
Woman, open the door, don't let it sting  
I wanna breathe that fire again  
  
She said, I don't mind, you don't mind  
Cause I don't shine if you don't shine  
Put your back on me  
Put your back on me  
Put your back on me  
  
The stars are blazing like rebel diamonds cut out of the sun  
When you read my mind

You've painted up your lips and rolled and curled your tinted hair  
Ruby are you contemplating going out somewhere  
The shadow on the wall tells me the sun is going down  
Oh Ruby,  
Don't take your love to town  
It wasn't me that started this whole crazy Asian war  
But I was proud to go and do my patriotic chore  
Yes it's true that I'm not the man I used to be  
Oh Ruby,  
I still need some company  
It's hard to love a man whose legs are bent and paralyzed  
And the wants and the needs of a woman your age, Ruby I realize  
But it won't be long I've heard them say until I'm not around  
Oh Ruby,  
Don't take your love to town  
She's leaving now cause I just heard the slamming of the door  
The way I know I've heard it slam 100 times before  
And if I could move I'd get my gun and put her in the ground  
Oh Ruby,  
Don't take your love to town  
Oh Ruby,  
For God sakes turn around

Blonde hair blowin' in the summer wind  
A blue-eyed girl playing in the sand  
I'd been on a trail for a little while  
But that was the night that she broke down and held my hand  
The teenage rush, she said, 'maybe I'll just runaway, we got time'  
Well that ain't much...  
We can't wait 'til tomorrow  
You gotta know that this is real, baby why you wanna fight it?  
It's the one thing you can choose, oh!  
  
We got engaged on a Friday night  
I swore on the head of our unborn child that I could take care of the three of
us  
But I got the tendency to slip when the nights get wild.  
It's in my blood  
She says she might just runaway somewhere else, some place good  
We can't wait 'til tomorrow  
You gotta know that this is real, baby why you wanna fight it?  
It's the one thing you can choose  
  
Let's take a chance baby we can't lose  
And we're all just runaways  
I knew that when I met you, I'm not gonna let you runaway  
I knew that when I held you, I wasn't lettin' go  
  
We used to look at the stars and confess our dreams  
Hold each other to the morning light  
We used to laugh, now we only fight  
Baby are you lonesome now?  
  
At night I come home after they go to sleep  
Like a stumbling ghost, I haunt these halls  
There's a picture of us on our wedding day  
I recognize the girl but I can't settle in these walls  
  
We can't wait 'til tomorrow  
No we're caught up in the appeal, baby why you wanna hide it?  
It's the last thing on my mind  
(Why you wanna hide it?)  
I turn the engine over and my body just comes alive and we all just runaway  
I knew that when I met you, I'm not gonna let you runaway  
I knew that when I held you, I wasn't lettin go, no no no!  
(No no no!)  
(And we're all just runaways)  
Yeah runaway  
(And we're all just runaways)  
Yeah

To the centre of the city where all roads meet, waiting for you  
To the depths of the ocean where all hopes sank, searching for you  
Well I was moving through the silence without motion, waiting for you  
In a room with a window in the corner I found truth  
  
In the shadowplay acting out your own death, knowing no more  
  
As the assassins all grouped in four lines, dancing on the floor  
And with cold steel, odor on their bodies made a move to connect  
I could only stare in disbelief as the crowds all left  
  
I did everything, everything I wanted to  
I let them use you for their own ends  
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you  
To the centre of the city in the night, waiting for you

Once in a lifetime, the suffering of fools  
To find our way home, to break in these palms  
Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)  
Once in a lifetime  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
  
Once in a lifetime, the breaking of the roof  
To find that our home, has long been out grown  
Draw me a life line, 'cause honey I got nothing to lose  
Once in a lifetime (Once in a lifetime)  
Once in a lifetime  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
  
Look at my reflection in the mirror  
Underneath the power of the light  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a shot at the night  
I feel like I'm losing the fight  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night  
Give me a moment, some kinda mysterious  
Give me a shot at the night

Ha  
I gotta tell ya  
I'll make it better  
But I know there's somethin' I needed to say  
When I was out, though  
Maybe you were better alone  
I know I'll make it home  
  
She told me sweet thang  
Run a labour  
In your shoes  
Touch me til I follow in love  
I wanna help her  
Maybe we were better alone  
I wanna show you how  
  
And then we walked out  
Make it made now  
I said I want it but I never alone  
I wanna show you  
Maybe we were somethin' uncool  
I wanna make you sing  
  
Uh uh oh  
Uh uh oh  
Uh uh oh

Save some face, you know you've only got one  
Change your ways while you're young  
Boy, one day you'll be a man  
Oh girl, he'll help you understand  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
Looking back at sunsets on the East side  
We lost track of the time  
Dreams aren't what they used to be  
Some things sat by so carelessly  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
And someone is calling my name  
From the back of the restaurant  
And someone is playing a game  
In the house that I grew up in  
And someone will drive her around  
Down the same streets that I did  
On the same streets that I did  
  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
Smile like you mean it  
  
Oh no, oh no no no  
Oh no, oh no no no

Breakin' my back just to know your name  
Seventeen tracks and I've had it with this game  
A breakin' my back just to know your name  
But heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Anything goes but don't blink, you might miss  
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this  
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight  
  
[Chorus]  
Well somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  
  
Ready let's roll onto something new  
Takin' it's toll then I'm leaving without you  
'Cause heaven ain't close in a place like this  
I said heaven ain't close in a place like this  
Bring it back down, bring it back down tonight  
Never thought I'd let a rumor ruin my moonlight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A rushing, rushing around  
  
Pace yourself for me  
I said maybe, baby, please  
But I just don't know now  
When all I want to do is try  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A rushing, rushing around  
  
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  
  
A rushing, rushing around  
  
Somebody told me you had a boyfriend  
Who looked like a girlfriend  
That I had in February of last year  
It's not confidential, I've got potential  
  
A rushing, rushing around

Lift me up on my honour  
Take me over this spell  
Get this weight of my shoulder  
I carried it well  
Loose these shackles of pressure  
Shake me out of these chains  
Lead me not to temptation  
Hold my hand harder  
Ease my mind  
Roll down the smokescreen  
And open the sky  
  
Let me fly  
Then I need a release from  
These troubles of mine  
Fix my feet  
When they're stumbling  
And well you know it hurts sometimes  
You know it's going to bleed sometimes  
  
Dig me out from this thorn tree  
Help me bury my shame  
Keep my eyes from the fire  
They can't handle the flame  
They've cut out from my brothers  
When most of them fail  
I carried it well  
  
Let me fly  
Then I need a release from  
These troubles of mine  
Fix my feet  
When they're stumbling  
I guess you know it hurts sometimes  
You know it's going to bleed sometimes  
  
Now hold on  
I'm not looking for sweet talk  
I'm looking for time  
Time for towering sweet folk  
Brother 'cause it hurts sometimes  
You know it's going to bleed sometimes  
Hold on  
  
You know it's going to hurt sometimes  
When you call me  
  
Hold on  
Hold on  
Hold on  
  
I'm going to climb that symphony home  
And make it mine  
And this pleasure is mine  
Mark my way  
See all these pessimistic sufferers  
Tend to drag me down  
So I could use it to shelter  
What good I've found

Michael plays with stars  
Soul Sister won't you take a ride in his car  
Late to call  
When you wanted to be all  
  
Baby don't be so shy  
Rock children hold your heads up high  
In the night while I try  
And tell the ballad of Valentine  
  
You got it bad, but you know it's true  
  
I caught up with a friend in Dallas  
We took a trip to New Orleans  
Those black-eyed ladies  
Won't say they're sorry  
  
We finally caught a train to Memphis  
Where everybody talks the same  
Those blue suede babies  
All know my name  
  
And I said hold tight  
Can't you see it's hurting me  
But I've got the buzz  
Like Marlon Brando  
Michael Valentine, can't we unite?  
  
We ended up in North Dakota  
Although my heart's in Mexico  
My  
All went to Soho  
  
With your new suit, and your black tie  
Hold on, you're just a gambling man, all proper like  
I broke to the right and I caught your eye  
Shut your mouth and wave goodbye  
Tonight, I ain't gonna let you rain on this parade  
  
And I said hold tight  
Can't you see it's hurting me  
But I've got the buzz  
Like Marlon Brando  
Straight faced with misery tonight  
  
And I will not lie when I say I ain't cold no more  
But I've got the buzz  
Like Greta Garbo  
Walking forwards in the sun  
And I've got a cold tale left to write  
  
Well uh oh  
I know he's gonna be there tonight

Candy talks to strangers  
Thinks her life's in danger  
No one gives a damn about her hair  
It's lonely down on track street  
She used to go by Jackie  
The cops, they'll steal your dreams and they'll kill your prayers  
Take a number where the blood just barely dried  
  
Wait for something better  
No one behind you  
Watching your shadows  
This feeling won't go  
  
Crooked wheels keep turning  
Children, are you learning  
Acclimatize but don't you lose the plot  
A history of blisters  
Your brothers and your sisters  
Somewhere in the pages we forgot  
  
Take a number Jackie  
Where the blood just barely dried  
You know I'm on your side  
  
Wait for something better  
No one behind you  
Watching your shadows  
You gotta be stronger than the story  
Don't let it blind you  
Rivers of shadow  
This feeling wont go  
  
And the sky is full of dreams  
But you don't know how to fly  
I don't have a simple answer  
But I know that I could answer  
Something better  
  
This feeling won't go  
  
Wait for it [Repeat: x4]

Leaves are fallin' down on the beautiful ground  
I heard a story from the man in red  
He said, the leaves are fallin' down  
Such a beautiful sound  
Son, I think you'd better go ahead  
But you always hold your head up high  
Cause it's a long, long, long way down  
This town was meant for passing through  
Boy, it ain't nothin' new  
Now go and show 'em that the world stayed round  
But it's a long, long, long way down  
  
You better run for the hills  
Before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Don't watch it turn  
I just want to show you what I know  
And catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I just get along with myself?  
I never did get along with everybody else  
I've been tryin' hard to do what's right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
This river is wild  
This river is wild  
  
Run for the hills before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Don't watch it turn  
I shake a little  
Sometimes I'm nervous when I talk  
I shake a little  
Sometimes I hate the line I walk  
I just wanna to show you what I know  
Catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I just get along with myself?  
I never did get along with everybody else  
I've been trying hard to do what's right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
Because this river is wild  
Godspeed ya, boy  
This river is wild  
  
Now Adam's taking bombs, and he's stuck on his mom  
Because that bitch keeps tryin' to make him pray  
He's with the hippie in the park, combing over the dark  
Just tryin' to get some of that little-girl play  
  
You better run for the hills before they burn  
Listen to the sound of the world  
Don't watch it turn  
I just want to show you what I know  
And catch you when the current  
Lets you go  
  
Or should I get along with myself?  
I never did get along with everybody else  
I've been tryin' hard to do what's right  
But you know I could stay here  
All night  
And watch the clouds fall from the sky  
This pain is hell in me tonight  
Because this river is wild  
Godspeed ya, boy  
This river is wild  
This river is wild  
Godspeed ya, boy  
This river is wild  
  
And cars are everywhere  
Raisin' dust at the fairground  
I don't think I ever seen so many headlights  
But there's somethin' pullin' me  
The circus and the crew  
Well, they're just passin' through  
Makin' sure the merry still goes 'round  
But it's a long, long, long way down

He's always trouble with his noncomplacent  
Shotgun eyes, shotgun eyes  
His subtlety, his mystery  
Not like the other guys  
  
She's always taken by his reputation  
He's so bad, he's so bad  
On Saturday night, they're running for the shadow  
  
You say your heart ain't ever been broken  
You think you know where you're going  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
You say this life has given you nothing  
You got another thing coming  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
  
He'll get a warning sign to keep his distance  
From her old man, from her old man  
Now the story of forbidden love  
Has gotta make a stand  
  
So in the middle of the early morning  
They'll slip away, slip away  
And we know they'll do their best  
Somewhere in the golden west  
  
Oh yeah, and we'll watch them drive  
They're so alive  
  
You say your heart ain't ever been broken  
You think you know where you're going  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
You say this life has given you nothing  
You got another thing coming  
Tidal wave  
Tidal wave come rushing over me  
Tidal wave  
  
These tidal waves are caught off track  
Come tomorrow, cause I can't go back  
Come together, can't you see  
Tidal wave gonna cover me.  
These tidal waves are caught off track  
Come tomorrow, cause I can't go back  
Come together, can't you see  
Tidal wave gonna cover me.  
  
Cover me  
I can't go back  
Can't you see

When everybody else refrains  
My uncle Jonny did cocaine  
He's convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey, Jonny  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
I wanna go out tonight  
Come a little closer to the city lights  
Levitation ain't your only friend  
Levitation coming back again  
Feel a burning in your body's core  
It's a yearning that you can't ignore  
Now I wanna go out tonight  
  
Superman and hold on tight  
He's convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey, Jonny  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
My appetite ain't got no heart  
I said, my appetite ain't got no heart  
Shocking people when you feel that pull  
Shock 'em, drop 'em when you know it's full  
  
I feel a burning in your body's core  
It's a yearning that you can't ignore  
I gotta go out tonight  
Hey, Jonny, I got faith in you, man  
I mean it, it's gonna be all right  
He's convinced himself right in his brain  
That it helps to take away the pain  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
Tell us what's going on  
Feels like everything's wrong  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
If the future is real  
Jonny, you've got to heal  
Hey, what you say, Jonny?  
  
When everybody else refrains  
My uncle Jonny did cocaine

She's got her halo and wings  
Hidden under his eyes  
But she's an angel for sure  
She just can't stop telling lies  
But it's too late for his love  
Already caught in a trap  
His angel's kiss was a joke  
And she is not coming back  
  
Because heaven sends and heaven takes  
Crashing cars in his brain  
Keep him tied up to a dream  
And only she can set him free  
And then he says to me  
  
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now  
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now  
  
Yeah she's got a criminal mind  
He's got a reason to pray  
His life is under the gun  
He's got to hold every day  
  
Now he just wants to wake up  
Yeah, just to prove it's a dream  
Cause she's an angel for sure  
But that remains to be seen  
  
Because heaven sends and heaven takes  
Crashing cars in his brain  
Keep him tied up to a dream  
And only she can set him free  
And then he says to me  
  
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now  
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now  
  
Stupid on the streets of London  
James Dean in the rain  
Without her it's not the same  
The same, the same, but it's alright  
  
Because heaven sends and heaven takes  
Crashing cars in his brain  
Keep him tied up to a dream  
And only she can set him free  
And then he says to me  
  
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now  
Kill me now, kill me now, kill me now, kill me now  
Again and again

A police car was outside your house today  
I haven't seen you, in a couple of days  
They knocked on your door, and then they went away  
Your mother looked scared, but she didn't cry  
She didn't cry  
  
On one hand, I've got myself to blame  
But on the other, it's always the same  
Follow suit  
Shake your head, tell me that it's a lie  
I don't want you for dead, but I want you to die  
Without a good friend, on a sunshine  
I know I want survival, but you don't know why  
  
Where is she?  
Where is she?  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh I've seen you you're crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
  
On one hand, I've got myself to blame  
But on the other, it's always the same thing  
Follow suit  
Shake your head, tell me that it's a lie  
I don't want you for dead, but I want you to die  
Without a good friend, on a bad day  
Without a soft surrender, but what do you say?  
  
All of these tears that we've cried  
All of these tears that we've cried  
  
Where is she?  
Where is she?  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh I've seen you, you're crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
  
Where is she?  
Where is she?  
Where is my baby girl  
Oh I've seen you you're crazy  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
What have you done with my whole wide world?  
What have you done?

Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
  
They hug in silence,  
As the sun sets.  
On their empty street,  
Their suspicions where they rise and hide.  
And then who sweeps them off she doesn't leave.  
She walks inside and  
Pours a strong one.  
Put her mind at ease.  
It's the calm before another storm.  
And the friendships from the whiskey to the keys.  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys... dance.  
  
Her heart is racing.  
She phones a friend to say  
  
I'm in an awful place.  
That fools been messin' around on me  
I've seen it in his eyes and on his face  
Hold on a minute.  
You're talking crazy  
Don't be that jealous girl.  
Just tell him you need an hour or two.  
Cause we're going go and change somebodies world.  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
  
It's the calm before another storm...  
It's the calm before another storm  
And the friendships from the whiskey to the keys.  
  
Take me to the place where the white boys dance.  
Take me to the place where they run and play.  
My baby is gone, you might have a chance.  
Just take me to the place where the white boys... dance.

Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
  
I feel it inside, down in my soul  
And I just can't hide these things I know  
We could be friends  
And I promise that it won't go bad  
But hopefully this story ends  
But you ain't got nothing I never had  
So let's take it slow  
  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
  
Someone must have loved you  
Not the way that I do  
You're missing what I'm trying to say  
Ain't nothing getting in my way  
  
So tell me that's fantastic  
  
And promise me, you'll always try  
I find it so romantic  
When you look into my beautiful eyes  
And lose control  
  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
Who let you go?  
  
I don't know what it means  
But I've been wondering  
Who let you go?  
  
And honey, when you walk my way  
It makes me wanna say  
Ohhhh  
  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
Sha-la-la-la, sha-la-la-la  
Sh-la-la-la-la-la-la?

There's a plane, and I am flying  
There's a mountain waiting for me  
Oh, these years have been so trying  
  
I don't know if I can use them  
Am I strong enough  
To be the one?  
Will I live to have some children?  
  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
I wouldn't be bothering you  
  
Father  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
And if all our days are numbered  
Then why do I keep counting?  
  
My sugar sweet  
Is so attainable  
This behavior so unexplainable  
The days just slip and slide  
Like they always did  
The trouble is my head  
Won't let me forget  
  
I took one last good look around  
So many unusual sounds  
I gotta get my feet on the ground  
  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
I wouldn't be bothering you  
  
Father  
Help me get down  
I can make  
Help me get down  
Help me get down  
I can make it  
Help me get down  
  
If I only knew the answer  
And if all our days are numbered  
I wouldn't be bothering you  
  
Would you help me get down?  
  
If I only knew the answer  
If I change my way of living  
And if I pave my streets with good times  
Will the mountain keep on giving?  
  
And if all of our days are numbered  
Then why do I keep counting?

The sanest days are mad  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the price  
Very closely  
  
Some men here,  
They have a special interest in your career  
They wanna help you to grow  
And then siphon all your dough  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass  
You'll never believe me so  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Sick down to my heart  
Well that's just the way it goes  
  
Some men here,  
They know the full extent of your distress  
They kneel and pray  
And they say:  
"Long may it last"  
Why don't you find out for yourself?  
Then you'll see the glass hidden in the grass  
Backseats come and go  
For which you must allow  
Sick down to my heart  
That's just the way it goes  
  
Don't rake up my mistakes  
I know exactly what they are  
And what do you do?  
Well, you just sit there  
I've been stabbed in the back  
So many, many times  
I don't have any skin  
But that's just the way it goes
