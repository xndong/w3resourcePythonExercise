Just before our love got lost you said  
"I am as constant as a northern star" and I said,  
"Constantly in the darkness  
Where's that at?  
If you want me I'll be in the bar"  
  
On the back of a cartoon coaster  
In the blue TV screen light  
I drew a map of Canada  
Oh Canada  
With your face sketched on it twice  
  
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter  
And so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling and I would  
Still be on my feet  
Oh I would still be on my feet  
  
Oh I am a lonely painter  
I live in a box of paints  
I'm frightened by the devil  
And I'm drawn to those ones that ain't afraid  
I remember that time that you told me, you said  
"Love is touching souls"  
Surely you touched mine 'cause  
Part of you pours out of me  
In these lines from time to time  
  
Oh you are in my blood like holy wine  
You taste so bitter  
And so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling  
Still I'd be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
  
I met a woman  
She had a mouth like yours, she knew your life  
She knew your devils and your deeds and she said  
"Go to him  
stay with him if you can  
But be prepared to bleed"  
  
Oh but you are in my blood you're my holy wine  
You're so bitter  
bitter and so sweet oh  
I could drink a case of you darling  
Still I'd be on my feet  
I would still be on my feet  
hmm

The rain slammed hard as bars  
It caught me--by surprise  
Mutts of the planet  
And shook me down for alibis  
I'm waiting  
For the keeper to release me  
Debating this sentence  
Biding my time  
In memories  
Of old friends of mine  
  
In daydreams of Birdland  
I see my soul on fire  
Burning up the bandstand  
Next time  
I'll be bigger!  
I'll be better than ever!  
I'll be happily attached  
To my cold hard cash!  
But now Manhattan holds me  
To a chair in the sky  
With the bird in my ears  
And boats in my eyes  
Going by  
  
There are things I wish I'd done  
Some friends I'm gonna miss  
Beautiful lovers  
I never got the chance to kiss  
  
Daydreamin' drugs the pain of living  
Processions of missing  
Lovers and friends  
Fade in and they fade out again  
In these daydreams of rebirth  
I see myself in style  
Raking in what I'm worth  
Next time  
I'll be bigger!  
I'll be better than ever!  
I'll be resurrected royal!  
I'll be rich as standard oil!  
But now, Manhattan holds me  
To a chair in the sky  
With the bird in my ears  
And boats in my eyes  
Going by

A strange boy is weaving  
A course of grace and havoc  
On a yellow skateboard  
Through midday sidewalk traffic  
Just when I think he's foolish and childish  
And I want him to be manly  
I catch my fool and my child  
Needing love and understanding  
  
What a strange, strange boy  
He still lives with his family  
Even the war and the navy  
Couldn't bring him to maturity  
  
He keeps referring back to school days  
And clinging to his child  
Fidgeting and bullied  
His crazy wisdom holding onto something wild  
He asked me to be patient  
Well I failed  
"Grow up!" I cried  
And as, the smoke was clearing he said  
"Give me one good reason why!"  
  
What a strange, strange boy  
He sees the cars as sets of waves  
Sequences of mass and space  
He sees the damage in my face  
  
We got high on travel  
And we got drunk on alcohol  
And on love the strongest poison and medicine of all  
See how that feeling comes and goes  
Like the pull of moon on tides  
Now I am surf rising  
Now parched ribs of sand at his side  
  
What a strange, strange boy  
I gave him clothes and jewelry  
I gave him my warm body  
I gave him power over me  
  
A thousand glass eyes were staring  
In a cellar full of antique dolls  
I found an old piano  
And sweet chords rose up in waxed New England halls  
While the boarders were snoring  
Under crisp white sheets of curfew  
We were newly lovers then  
We were fire in the stiff-blue-haired-house-rules

I am on a lonely road and I am traveling  
Traveling, traveling, traveling  
Looking for something, what can it be  
Oh I hate you some, I hate you some  
I love you some  
Oh I love you when I forget about me  
I want to be strong I want to laugh along  
I want to belong to the living  
Alive, alive, I want to get up and jive  
I want to wreck my stockings in some jukebox dive  
Do you want, do you want, do you want  
To dance with me baby  
Do you want to take a chance  
On maybe finding some sweet romance with me baby  
Well, come on  
  
All I really really want our love to do  
Is to bring out the best in me and in you too  
All I really really want our love to do  
Is to bring out the best in me and in you  
I want to talk to you, I want to shampoo you  
I want to renew you again and again  
Applause, applause, life is our cause  
When I think of your kisses  
My mind see-saws  
Do you see, do you see, do you see  
How you hurt me baby  
So I hurt you too  
Then we both get so blue  
  
I am on a lonely road and I am traveling  
Looking for the key to set me free  
Oh the jealousy, the greed is the unraveling  
It's the unraveling  
And it undoes all the joy that could be  
I want to have fun, I want to shine like the sun  
I want to be the one that you want to see  
I want to knit you a sweater  
Want to write you a love letter  
I want to make you feel better  
I want to make you feel free  
Hm, hm, hm, hm,  
Want to make you feel free  
I want to make you feel free

I was driving across the burning desert  
When I spotted six jet planes  
Leaving six white vapor trails across the bleak terrain  
It was the hexagram of the heavens  
it was the strings of my guitar  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
The drone of flying engines  
Is a song so wild and blue  
It scrambles time and seasons if it gets through to you  
Then your life becomes a travelogue  
Of picture-post-card-charms  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
People will tell you where they've gone  
They'll tell you where to go  
But till you get there yourself you never really know  
Where some have found their paradise  
Others just come to harm  
Oh Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
I wish that he was here tonight  
It's so hard to obey  
His sad request of me to kindly stay away  
So this is how I hide the hurt  
As the road leads cursed and charmed  
I tell Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
A ghost of aviation  
She was swallowed by the sky  
Or by the sea, like me she had a dream to fly  
Like Icarus ascending  
On beautiful foolish arms  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
Maybe I've never really loved  
I guess that is the truth  
I've spent my whole life in clouds at icy altitude  
And looking down on everything  
I crashed into his arms  
Amelia, it was just a false alarm  
  
I pulled into the Cactus Tree Motel  
To shower off the dust  
And I slept on the strange pillows of my wanderlust  
I dreamed of 747's  
Over geometric farms  
Dreams, Amelia, dreams and false alarms

At last, my love has come along  
My lonely days are over, and life is like a song  
At last, the skies above are blue  
My heart was wrapped in clover  
The night I looked at you  
  
I found a dream that I could speak to  
A dream that I could call my own  
I found a thrill to press my cheek to  
A thrill I'd never known  
You smiled, and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven, for you are mine at last.  
  
I found a dream that I could speak to,  
A dream that I could call my own  
I found a thrill to press my cheek to  
A thrill that I had never known  
You smiled, and then the spell was cast  
And here we are in Heaven  
For you are mine at last.

You're so square--baby  
You're so square. ..  
Oh, you don't like greasy diners  
You don't like sleazy bands  
You just want to go  
To a movie show  
And sit there holding hands  
You're so square  
Baby I don't care  
  
You don't like going to parties  
To toot and talk all night long  
You just want to park  
Where it's nice and dark  
And kiss me, sweet and strong  
You're so square  
Baby I don't care  
  
You don't know any dance steps  
That are new  
But nobody else can love me  
Like you do  
  
I don't know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why  
I love you baby  
I guess it's just because  
You're so square  
Darlin' I don't care  
  
Oh, I don't know why my heart flips  
I only know it does  
I wonder why  
I love you baby  
I guess it's just because  
You're so square  
I don't care  
  
You're so square

The cats are in the flower bed  
A red hawk rides the sky  
I guess I should be happy  
Just to be alive...  
But we have poisoned everything  
And oblivious to it all  
The cell phone zombies babble  
Through the shopping malls  
While condors fall from Indian skies  
Whales beach and die in sand...  
Bad dreams are good  
In the great plan.  
  
You cannot be trusted  
Do you even know you're lying  
It's dangerous to kid yourself  
You go deaf and dumb and blind.  
You take with such entitlement.  
You give bad attitude.  
You have no grace  
No empathy  
No gratitude  
  
You have no sense of consequence  
Oh my head is in my hands...  
Bad dreams are good  
In the great plan.  
  
Before that altering apple  
We were one with everything  
No sense of self and other  
No self-consciousness.  
But now we have to grapple  
With our man-made world backfiring  
Keeping one eye on our brother's deadly selfishness.  
  
And everyone's a victim!  
Nobody's hands are clean.  
There's so very little left of wild Eden Earth  
So near the jaws of our machines.  
We live in these electric scabs.  
These lesions once were lakes.  
No one knows how to shoulder the blame  
Or learn from past mistakes...  
So who will come to save the day?  
Mighty Mouse?  
Superman?  
Bad dreams are good in the great plan.

Come to the dinner gong  
The table is laden high  
Fat bellies and hungry little ones  
Tuck your napkins in  
And take your share  
Some get the gravy  
And some get the gristle  
Some get the marrow bone  
And some get nothing  
Though there's plenty to spare  
  
I took my share down by the sea  
Paper plates and Javex bottles on the tide  
Seagulls come down  
And they squawk at me  
Down where the water-skiers glide  
  
Some turn to Jesus  
And some turn to heroin  
Some turn to rambling round  
Looking for a clean sky  
And a drinking stream  
Some watch the paint peel off  
Some watch their kids grow up  
Some watch their stocks and bonds  
Waiting for that big deal  
American Dream  
  
I took my dream down by the sea  
Yankee yachts and lobster pots and sunshine  
And logs and sails  
And Shell Oil pails  
Dogs and tugs and summertime  
Back in the banquet line  
Angry young people crying  
  
Who let the greedy in  
And who left the needy out  
Who made this salty soup  
Tell him we're very hungry now  
For a sweeter fare  
In the cookie I read  
"Some get the gravy  
And some get the gristle  
Some get the marrow bone  
And some get nothing  
Though there's plenty to spare"

Three waitresses all wearing  
Black diamond earrings  
Talking about zombies  
And Singapore slings  
No trouble in their faces  
Not one anxious voice  
None of the crazy you get  
From too much choice  
The thumb and the satchel  
Or the rented Rolls-Royce  
And you think she knows something  
By the second refill  
You think she's enlightened  
As she totals your bill  
You say "Show me the way  
To Barangrill"  
  
Well some say it's in service  
They say "Humble Makes Pure"  
You're hoping it's near Folly  
'Cause you're headed that way for sure  
And you just have to laugh  
'Cause it's all so crazy  
Ah, her mind's on her boyfriend  
And eggs over easy  
It's just a trick on you  
Her mirrors and your will  
So you ask the truck driver  
On the way to the till  
But he's just a slave  
To Barangrill  
  
The guy at the gas pumps  
He's got a lot of soul  
He sings Merry Christmas for you  
Just like Nat King Cole  
And he makes up his own tune  
Right on the spot  
About whitewalls and windshields  
And this job he's got  
And you want to get moving  
And you want to stay still  
But lost in the moment  
Some longing gets filled  
And you even forget to ask  
"Hey, Where's Barangrill?"

Don't look at me.  
  
Every day is so wonderful  
And suddenly, it's hard to breathe  
Now and then, I get insecure  
From all the fame, I'm so ashamed  
  
I am beautiful no matter what they say  
Words can't bring me down  
I am beautiful in every single way  
Yes, words can't bring me down  
So don't you bring me down today  
  
To all your friends, you're delirious  
So consumed in all your doom  
Trying hard to fill the emptiness  
The piece is gone and the puzzle undone  
That's the way it is  
  
Your are beautiful no matter what they say  
Words won't bring you down  
You are beautiful in every single way  
Yes, words won't brin you down  
So don't you bring me down today  
  
No matter what we do  
(no matter what we do)  
No matter what they say  
(no matter what they say)  
When the sun is shining through  
Then the clouds won't stay  
  
And everywhere we go  
(everywhere we go)  
The sun won't always shine  
(sun won't always shine)  
But tomorrow will find a way  
All the otther times  
  
We are beautiful no matter what they say  
Yes, words won't bring us down  
We are beautiful no matter what they say  
Yes, words can't bring us down  
Don't you bring me down today  
  
Don't you bring me down today  
Don't you bring me down today

They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
With a pink hotel, a boutique  
And a swinging hot spot  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
  
They took all the trees  
And put them in a tree museum  
And they charged all the people  
A dollar and a half to see 'em  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And they put up a parking lot  
  
Hey farmer farmer  
Put away that D.D.T. now  
Give me spots on my apples  
But leave me the birds and the bees  
Please  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot  
  
Late last night  
I heard the screen door slam  
And a big yellow taxi  
Took away my old man  
Don't it always seem to go  
That you don't know what you've got  
Till it's gone  
They paved paradise  
And put up a parking lot

There's a crow flying  
Black and ragged  
Tree to tree  
He's black as the highway that's leading me  
Now he's diving down  
To pick up on something shiny  
I feel like that black crow  
Flying  
In a blue sky  
  
I took a ferry to the highway  
Then I drove to a pontoon plane  
I took a plane to a taxi  
And a taxi to a train  
I've been traveling so long  
How's I ever going to know my home  
When I see it again  
I'm like a black crow flying  
In a blue, blue sky  
  
In search of love and music  
My whole life has been  
Illumination  
Corruption  
And diving, diving, diving, diving.  
Diving down to pick up on every shiny thing  
Just like that black crow flying  
In a blue sky  
  
I looked at the morning  
After being up all night  
I looked at my haggard face in the bathroom light  
I looked out the window  
And I saw that ragged soul take flight  
I saw a back crow flying  
In a blue sky  
Oh I'm like a black crow flying  
In a blue sky

The blond in the bleachers  
She flips her hair for you  
Above the loudspeakers  
You start to fall  
She follows you home  
But you miss living alone  
You can still hear sweet mysteries  
Calling you  
The bands and the roadies  
Lovin' 'em and leavin' 'em  
It's pleasure to try 'em  
It's trouble to keep 'em  
Cause it seems like you've gotta give up  
Such a piece of your soul  
When you give up the chase  
Feeling it hot and cold  
You're in rock 'n' roll  
It's the nature of the race  
It's the unknown child  
So sweet and wild  
It's youth  
It's too good to waste  
  
She tapes her regrets  
To the microphone stand  
She says "You can't hold the hand  
Of a rock 'n' roll man  
Very long  
Or count on your plans  
With a rock 'n' roll man  
Very long  
Compete with the fans  
For your rock 'n' roll man  
For very long  
The girls and the bands  
And the rock 'n' roll man"

Lady called the blue boy, love,  
She took him home  
Made himself an idol, yes,  
So he turned to stone  
Like a pilgrim she travelled  
Ta place her flowers  
Before his granite grace  
And she prayed aloud for love  
To waken in his face  
In his face, oh ?  
  
Sometimes in the evening  
He would read to her  
Roll her in his arms  
And give his seed to her  
She would wake in the morning  
Without him  
And go to the window  
And look out through the pain  
But the statue in her garden  
He always looked the same  
He looked the same, ah ?  
  
Bring her boots of leather  
And she will dance for him  
Shyly from a feather fan  
She'll glance for him  
Here he comes after midnight  
To find her again  
He will come a few times more  
Till he finds a lady statue  
Standing in a door  
In her door, oh ?

I've got a blue motel room  
With a blue bedspread  
I've got the blues inside and outside my head  
Will you still love me  
When I call you up when I'm down  
Here in Savannah it's pouring rain  
Palm trees in the porch light like slick black cellophane  
Will you still love me  
When I call you up when I get back to town  
I know that you've got all those pretty girls coming on  
Hanging on your boom-boom-pachyderm  
Will you tell those girls that you've got German Measles  
Honey, tell them you've got germs  
I hope you'll be thinking of me  
Because I'll be thinking of you  
While I'm traveling home alone  
Tell those girls that you've got Joni  
She's coming back home  
  
I've got road maps  
From two dozen states  
I've got coast to coast just to contemplate  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to town  
It's funny how these old feelings hang around  
You think they're gone  
No, no  
They just go underground  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to L.A. town  
You and me, we're like America and Russia  
We're always keeping score  
We're always balancing the power  
And that can get to be a cold cold war  
We're going to have to hold ourselves a peace talk  
In some neutral cafe  
You lay down your sneaking round the town, honey  
And I'll lay down the highway  
  
I've got a blue motel room  
With a blue bedspread  
I've got the blues inside and outside my head  
Will you still love me  
When I get back to town

Everybody looks so ill at ease  
So distrustful so displeased  
Running down the table  
I see a borderline  
Like a barbed wire fence  
Strung tight, strung tense  
Prickling with pretense  
A borderline  
  
Why are you smirking at your friend?  
Is this to be the night when  
All well-wishing ends?  
All credibility revoked?  
Thin skin, thick jokes!  
Can we blame it on the smoke  
This borderline?  
  
Every bristling shaft of pride  
Church or nation  
Team or tribe  
Every notion we subscribe to  
Is just a borderline  
Good or bad, we think we know  
As if thinking makes things so!  
All convictions grow along a borderline  
  
Smug in your jaded expertise  
You scathe the wonder world  
And you praise barbarity  
In this illusionary place--  
This scared hard-edged rat race  
All liberty is laced with  
Borderlines  
  
Every income, every age  
Every fashion-plated rage  
Every measure, every gauge  
Creates a borderline  
Every stone thrown through glass  
Every mean-streets-kick ass  
Every swan caught on the grass  
Will draw a borderline  
  
You snipe so steady  
You snub so snide--  
So ripe and ready  
To diminish and deride!  
You're so quick to condescend  
My opinionated friend  
All you deface, all you defend  
Is just a borderline  
Just a borderline ...  
Another borderline ...  
Just a borderline

Rows and flows of angel hair  
And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons everywhere  
I've looked at clouds that way  
  
But now they only block the sun  
They rain and they snow on everyone  
So so many things I would've done  
But clouds got in my way  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and junes and ferris wheels  
The dizzy dancing way that you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real  
I've looked at love that way  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know love  
Really don't know love at all  
  
But now it's just another show  
and you leave em laughing when you go  
and if you can don't let them know  
Don't give yourself away  
  
Angel dust gets in your eyes, your hair  
On acid stars you're getting there  
My body's assembled into  
A little itty-bitty gift to you  
When you die, I've looked at life that way  
  
But now it's just another show  
You leave em laughing when you go  
So so don't let them inside, don't let them know  
Don't give yourself ohh away  
  
But now my friends are acting strange  
They shake their heads man, they say I've changed, well  
Well, something's lost, rearranged  
From living every, every, every, I've  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's just illusions I recall  
  
I really don't know, I really don't know  
I really don't know, I really don't know  
I really don't, I really don't clouds at all  
Why are we here.... Terrified, terrified, wow

Rows and flows of angel hair  
And ice cream castles in the air  
And feather canyons everywhere,  
I've looked at clouds that way.  
  
But now they only block the sun,  
They rain and they snow on everyone  
So many things I would have done,  
But clouds got in my way.  
  
I've looked at clouds from both sides now  
From up and down and still somehow  
It's cloud illusions I recall  
I really don't know clouds at all  
  
Moons and Junes and Ferris wheels,  
The dizzy dancing way that you feel  
As every fairy tale comes real,  
I've looked at love that way.  
  
But now it's just another show,  
You leave 'em laughing when you go  
And if you care, don't let them know,  
Don't give yourself away.  
  
I've looked at love from both sides now  
From give and take and still somehow  
It's love's illusions I recall  
I really don't know love at all  
  
Tears and fears and feeling proud,  
To say "I love you" right out loud  
Dreams and schemes and circus crowds,  
I've looked at life that way.  
  
Oh but now old friends they're acting strange,  
They shake their heads, they say I've changed  
Well something's lost, but something's gained  
In living every day.  
  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From win and lose and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all  
  
I've looked at life from both sides now  
From up and down, and still somehow  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life at all  
  
It's life's illusions I recall  
I really don't know life  
I really don't know life at all

There's a man who's been out sailing  
In a decade full of dreams  
And he takes her to a schooner  
And he treats her like a queen  
Bearing beads from California  
With their amber stones and green  
He has called her from the harbor  
He has kissed her with his freedom  
He has heard her off to starboard  
In the breaking and the breathing  
Of the water weeds  
While she was busy being free  
  
There's a man who's climbed a mountain  
And he's calling out her name  
And he hopes her heart can hear three thousand miles  
He calls again  
He can think her there beside him  
He can miss her just the same  
He has missed her in the forest  
While he showed her all the flowers  
And the branches sang the chorus  
As he climbed the scaley towers  
Of a forest tree  
While she was somewhere being free  
  
There's a man who's sent a letter  
And he's waiting for reply  
He has asked her of her travels  
Since the day they said goodbye  
He writes "Wish you were beside me  
We can make it if we try"  
He has seen her at the office  
With her name on all his papers  
Through the sharing of the profits  
He will find it hard to shake her  
From his memory  
And she's so busy being free  
  
There's a lady in the city  
And she thinks she loves them all  
There's the one who's thinking of her  
There's the one who sometimes calls  
There's the one who writes her letters  
With his facts and figures scrawl  
She has brought them to her senses  
They have laughed inside her laughter  
Now she rallies her defenses  
For she fears that one will ask her  
For eternity  
And she's so busy being free  
  
There's a man who sends her medals  
He is bleeding from the war  
There's a jouster and a jester and a man who owns a store  
There's a drummer and a dreamer  
And you know there may be more  
She will love them when she sees them  
They will lose her if they follow  
And she only means to please them  
And her heart is full and hollow  
Like a cactus tree  
While she's so busy being free

Sitting in a park in Paris, France  
Reading the news and it sure looks bad  
They won't give peace a chance  
That was just a dream some of us had  
Still a lot of land to see  
But I wouldn't stay here  
It's too old and cold and settled in its ways here.  
  
Oh, but California  
California, I'm coming home  
I'm going to see the folks I dig  
I'll even kiss a sunset pig  
California, I'm coming home.  
  
I met a redneck on a Grecian isle  
Who did the goat dance very well  
He gave me back my smile  
But he kept my camera to sell  
Oh the rogue, the red red rogue  
He cooked good omelets and stews  
And I might have stayed on with him there  
  
But my heart cried out for you, California  
Oh California, I'm coming home  
Oh make me feel good rock'n roll band  
I'm your biggest fan  
California, I'm coming home  
  
Oh it gets so lonely  
When you're walking  
And the streets are full of strangers  
All the news of home you read  
Just gives you the blues  
Just gives you the blues  
  
So I bought me a ticket  
I got on a plane to Spain  
Went to a party down a red dirt road  
There were lots of pretty people there  
Reading Rolling Stone, reading Vogue  
They said, "How long can you hang around?"  
I said a week, maybe two  
Just until my skin turns brown  
  
Then I'm going home to California  
California, I'm coming home  
Oh will you take me as I am  
Strung out on another man  
California, I'm coming home  
  
Oh it gets so lonely  
When you're walking  
And the streets are full of strangers  
All the news of home you read  
More about the war  
And the bloody changes  
Oh will you take me as I am?  
Will you take me as I am?  
Will you?  
Will you take me as I am?  
Hmmm mmmmm  
Take me as I am

I've been sitting up waiting for my sugar to show  
I've been listening to the sirens and the radio  
He said he'd be over three hours ago  
I've been waiting for his car on the hill  
He makes friends easy  
He's not like me  
I watch for judgement anxiously  
Now where in the city can that boy be  
Waiting for a car  
Climbing  
Climbing  
Climbing the hill  
  
He's a real good talker--I think he's friend  
Fast tires come screaming around the bend  
But there's still no buzzer  
They roll on  
And-I'm waiting for his car on the hill  
It always seems so righteous at the start  
When there's so much laughter  
When there's so much spark  
When there's so much sweetness in the dark  
Waiting for a car  
Climbing  
Climbing  
Climbing the hill

The wind is in from Africa  
Last night I couldn't sleep  
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here Carey  
But it's really not my home  
My fingernails are filthy, I got beach tar on my feet  
And I miss my clean white linen and my fancy French cologne  
  
Oh Carey get out your cane  
And I'll put on some silver  
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you fine  
  
Come on down to the Mermaid Cafe and I will buy you a bottle of wine  
And we'll laugh and toast to nothing and smash our empty glasses down  
Let's have a round for these freaks and these soldiers  
A round for these friends of mine  
Let's have another round for the bright red devil  
Who keeps me in this tourist town  
  
Come on, Carey, get out your cane  
I'll put on some silver  
Oh you're a mean old Daddy, but I like you  
  
Maybe I'll go to Amsterdam  
Or maybe I'll go to Rome  
And rent me a grand piano and put some flowers 'round my room  
But let's not talk about fare-thee-welIs now  
The night is a starry dome.  
And they're playin' that scratchy rock and roll  
Beneath the Matalla Moon  
  
Come on, Carey, get out your cane  
And I'll put on some silver  
You're a mean old Daddy, but I like you  
  
The wind is in from Africa  
Last night I couldn't sleep  
Oh, you know it sure is hard to leave here  
But, it's really not my home  
Maybe it's been too long a time  
Since I was scramblin' down in the street  
Now they got me used to that clean white linen  
And that fancy French cologne  
  
Oh Carey, get out your cane  
I'll put on my finest silver  
We'll go to the Mermaid Cafe  
Have fun tonight  
I said, Oh, you're a mean old Daddy, but you're out of sight

Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I heard  
Was a song outside my window, and the traffic wrote the words  
It came a-reeling up like Christmas bells, and rapping up like pipes and drums  
  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll wear it 'till the night comes  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I saw  
Was the sun through yellow curtains, and a rainbow on the wall  
Blue, red, green and gold to welcome you, crimson crystal beads to beckon  
  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
There's a sun show every second  
  
Now the curtain opens on a portrait of today  
And the streets are paved with passersby  
And pigeons fly  
And papers lie  
Waiting to blow away  
  
Woke up, it was a Chelsea morning, and the first thing that I knew  
There was milk and toast and honey and a bowl of oranges, too  
And the sun poured in like butterscotch and stuck to all my senses  
Oh, won't you stay  
We'll put on the day  
And we'll talk in present tenses  
  
When the curtain closes and the rainbow runs away  
I will bring you incense owls by night  
By candlelight  
By jewel-light  
If only you will stay  
Pretty baby, won't you  
Wake up, it's a Chelsea morning

Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel  
In the Broadway bridge  
We're crawling on our knees  
We've got flashlights and batteries  
We've got cold cuts from the fridge  
  
Last year about this time  
We used to climb up in the branches  
Just to sway there in some breeze  
Now the cops on the street  
They want Cherokee Louise  
  
People like to talk  
Tongues are waggin' over fences  
Waggin' over phones  
All their doors are locked  
God she can't even come to our house  
But I know where she'll go  
  
To the place where you can stand  
And press your hands like it was bubble bath  
In dust piled high as me  
Down under the street  
My friend  
Poor Cherokee Louise  
  
Ever since we turned 13  
It's like a minefield  
Walking to the door  
Going out you get the 3rd degree  
And comin' in you get the 3rd world war  
  
Tuesday after school  
We put our pennies on the rails  
And when the train went by  
We were jumpin' round like fools  
Goin' "Look no heads or tails"  
Goin' "Look my lucky prize"  
  
She runs home to her foster dad  
He opens up a zipper  
And he yanks her to her knees  
Oh please be here-please  
My friend  
Poor Cherokee Louise  
  
Cherokee Louise is hiding in this tunnel  
In the Broadway bridge  
We're crawling on our knees  
We've got Archie and Silver Screen  
I know where she is  
  
The place where you can stand  
And press your hand like it was bubblebath  
In dust piled high as me  
Down under the street  
My friend  
Poor Cherokee Louise  
Oh Cherokee Louise

Back in 1957  
We had to dance a foot apart  
And they hawk-eyed us from the sidelines  
Holding their rulers without a heart  
And so with just a touch of our fingers  
I could make our circuitry explode  
All we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(we were so young)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
We really thought we had a purpose  
We were so anxious to achieve  
We had hope  
The world held promise  
For a slave to liberty  
Freely I slaved away for something better  
And I was bought and sold  
And all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(we were so sure)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I feel your leg under the table  
Leaning into mine  
I feel renewed  
I feel disabled  
By these bonfires in my spine  
I don't know who the arsonist was  
Which incendiary soul  
But all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(you were so warm)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I am not some stone commission  
Like a statue in a park  
I am flesh and blood and vision  
I am howling in the dark  
Long blue shadows of the jackals  
Are falling on a pay phone by the road  
Oh all they ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(I was so low)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
Is this just vulgar electricity  
Is this the edifying fire  
(it was so pure)  
Does your smile's covert complicity  
Debase as it admires  
(just a flu with a temperature)  
Are you just checking out your mojo  
(oh oh)  
Or am I just fighting off growing old  
(just a high fever)  
All I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(it was so pure)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
I know we never will be perfect  
Never entirely clear  
(when the moon shines)  
We get hurt and we just panic  
And we strike out  
Out of fear  
(you were only being kind)  
I fear the sentence of this solitude  
200 years on hold  
(for my loving crime)  
Oh and all we ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(when the moon shines)  
Oh come in  
Come in from the cold  
  
When I thought life had some purpose  
Then I thought I had some choice  
(I was running blind)  
And I made some value judgments  
In a self-important voice  
(I was outa line)  
But then absurdity came over me  
And I longed to lose control  
(into no mind)  
Oh all I ever wanted  
Was just to come in from the cold  
  
Come in  
Come in from the cold  
(you were so kind)  
Please come in  
(so kind)  
Come in from the cold  
Come in come in  
Come in from the cold, etc.

All day I face the barren waste  
Without a taste of water  
Cool water  
Old Dan and I  
Our throats slate dry  
Our spirits cry out for water  
Cool clear water  
Keep on movin' Dan  
Some devils had a plan  
Buried poison in the sand  
Don't drink it man  
It's in the water  
Cool clear water  
In my mind I see  
A big green tree  
And a river flowin' free  
Waitin' up ahead  
For you and me  
Cool clear water  
  
The nights are cool and I'm a fool  
Each star is a pool of water  
Cool water  
But come the dawn  
We carry on  
We won't last long without water  
Cool clear water  
Keep on movin' Dan  
We're still in no-man's land  
Dry bones and sand  
People never planned here for water  
Cool clear water  
In my mind I see  
A big green tree  
And a river flowin' free  
Waiting up ahead for you and me  
Cool clear water  
  
The shadows sway  
They seem to say  
Tonight we pray for water  
Cool water  
And way up there  
If you care  
Please show us where  
There's good water  
Cool clear water

Love came to my door  
With a sleeping roll  
And a madman's soul  
He thought for sure I'd seen him  
Dancing up a river in the dark  
Looking for a woman  
To court and spark  
  
He was playing on the sidewalk  
For passing change  
When something strange happened  
Glory train passed through him  
So he buried the coins he made  
In People's Park  
And went looking for a woman  
To court and spark  
  
It seemed like he read my mind  
He saw me mistrusting him  
And still acting kind  
He saw how I worried sometimes  
I worry sometimes  
  
"All the guilty people," he said  
They've all seen the stain-  
On their daily bread  
On their christian names  
I cleared myself  
I sacrificed my blues  
And you could complete me  
I'd complete you  
  
His eyes were the color of the sand  
And the sea  
And the more he talked to me  
The more he reached me  
But I couldn't let go of L.A.  
City of the fallen angels

Peridots and periwinkle blue medallions  
Gilded galleons spilled across the ocean floor  
Treasure somewhere in the sea and he will find where  
Never mind their questions there's no answer for  
The roll of the harbor wake  
The songs that the rigging makes  
The taste of the spray he takes  
And he learns to give  
He aches and he learns to live  
He stakes all his silver  
On a promise to be free  
Mermaids live in colonies  
All his sea dreams come to me  
  
City satins left at home I will not need them  
I believe him when he tells of loving me  
Something truthful in the sea your lies will find you  
Leave behind your streets he said and come to me  
Come down from the neon nights  
Come down from the tourist sights  
Run down till the rain delights you  
You do not hide  
Sunlight will renew your pride  
Skin white by skin golden  
Like a promise to be free  
Dolphins playing in the sea  
All his sea dreams come to me  
  
Seabird I have seen you fly above the pilings  
I am smiling at your circles in the air  
I will come and sit by you while he lies sleeping  
Fold your fleet wings I have brought some dreams to share  
A dream that you love someone  
A dream that the wars are done  
A dream that you tell no one but the gray sea  
They'll say that you're crazy  
And a dream of a baby  
Like a promise to be free  
Children laughing out to sea  
All his sea dreams come to me

Day after day  
Miles and miles of railroad track  
Night after night  
Hummin' of the wheels  
Their hummin' seems to say  
He'll follow you someday  
But someday seems a million miles away  
Wish I could turn around  
And run back home again  
I've had no mercy  
Since the blues got on this train  
  
Day after day  
Make a dollar, need it twice  
Night after night  
Lie awake and dream  
Of days of auld lang syne  
Moonlight through the pine  
And linen table cloths all stained with wine  
Wish I could turn around  
And run back home again  
I've been so empty  
Since I caught that eastbound train  
  
Day after day  
Watch the hands move 'round the clock  
Night after night  
Searching for my soul  
So this must be my fate  
To sit and weep and wait  
And pray my darlin' comes before too late  
Wish I could turn around  
And run back home again  
I've been so lonely  
Since I caught that eastbound train

Dog eat dog  
It's dog eat dog, I'm just waking up  
The dove is in the dungeon  
And the white-washed hawks pedal hate and call it love  
Dog eat dog  
Holy hope in the hands of  
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers  
And big wig financiers  
  
Dog eat dog  
On prime time crime the victim begs  
Money is the road to justice  
And power walks it on crooked legs  
Prime, time, crime  
Holy hope in the hands of  
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers  
And big wig financiers  
  
Where the wealth's displayed  
Thieves and sycophants parade  
And where it's made,  
The slaves will be taken  
Some are treated well  
In these games of buy and sell  
And some like poor beast  
Are burdened down to breaking  
  
Dog eat dog!  
It's dog eat dog, ain't it flim flam man  
Dog eat dog, you can lie, cheat, skim, scam  
Beat'em any way you can  
Dog eat dog  
You'll do well in this land of  
Snakebite evangelists and racketeers  
You could get to be  
A big wig financier  
  
Land of snap decisions  
Land of short attention spans  
Nothing is savored  
Long enough to really understand  
In every culture in decline  
The watchful ones among the slaves  
Know all that is genuine will be  
Scorned and conned and cast away  
  
Dog eat dog  
People looking, seeing nothing  
Dog eat dog  
People listening, hearing nothing  
Dog eat dog  
People lusting, loving nothing  
Dog eat dog  
People stroking, touching nothing  
Dog eat dog  
Knowing nothing  
Dog eat dog

Build your dreams  
To the stars above  
But when you need someone true to love  
Don't go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
Play with fire  
Get your fingers burned  
But when there's no place left to turn  
Don't go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
You give the call to follow your heart  
You'll follow your heart, I know  
I've been around  
I'm an old hand  
I'll understand if you have to go  
  
So make your mark  
For your friends to see  
But when you need more than company  
Don't go to strangers  
Lover come to me  
  
Don't go to strangers  
Lover come to me

Don't interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
In flames our prophet witches  
Be polite  
A room full of glasses  
He says "Your notches liberation doll"  
And he chains me with that serpent  
To that Ethiopian wall  
  
Anima rising  
Queen of Queens  
Wash my guilt of Eden  
Wash and balance me  
Anima rising  
Uprising in me tonight  
She's a vengeful little goddess  
With an ancient crown to fight  
  
Truth goes up in vapors  
The steeples lean  
Winds of change patriarchs  
Snug in your bible belt dreams  
God goes up the chimney  
Like childhood Santa Claus  
The good slaves love the good book  
A rebel loves a cause  
  
I'm leaving on the 1:15  
You're darn right  
Since I was seventeen  
I've had no one over me  
He says "Anima rising-  
So what-  
Petrified wood process  
Tall timber down to rock!"  
  
Don't interrupt the sorrow  
Darn right  
He says "We walked on the moon  
You be polite."  
Don't let up the sorrow  
Death and birth and death and birth  
He says "Bring that bottle kindly  
And I'll pad your purse-  
I've got a head full of quandary  
And a mighty, mighty, thirst."  
  
Seventeen glasses  
Rhine wine  
Milk of the Madonna  
Clandestine  
He don't let up the sorrow  
He lies and he cheats  
It takes a heart like Mary's these days  
When your man gets weak

Don't worry 'bout me  
I'll get along  
Forget about me  
Just be happy my love  
  
Let's say that our little show is over  
And so the story ends  
Why not call it a day the sensible way  
And still be friends  
  
Look out for yourself  
That should be the rule  
Give your heart and your love  
To whomever you love  
Darlin' don't be a fool  
  
Why do we cling to this old faded thing  
That used to be  
So if you can forget  
Then you don't worry 'bout me

Everything comes and goes  
Marked by lovers and styles of clothes  
Things that you held high  
And told yourself were true  
Lost or changing as the days come down to you  
Down to you  
Constant stranger  
You're a kind person  
You're a cold person too  
It's down to you  
It all comes down to you.  
You go down to the pick up station  
Craving warmth and beauty  
You settle for less than fascination  
A few drinks later you're not so choosy  
When the closing lights strip off the shadows  
On this strange new flesh you've found  
Clutching the night to you like a fig leaf  
You hurry  
To the blackness  
And the blankets  
To lay down an impression  
And your loneliness  
  
In the morning there are lovers in the street  
They look so high  
You brush against a stranger  
And you both apologize  
Old friends seem indifferent  
You must have brought that on  
Old bonds have broken down  
Love is gone  
Ooh, love is gone  
Written on your spirit this sad song  
Love is gone  
  
Everything comes and goes  
Pleasure moves on too early  
And trouble leaves too slow  
Just when you're thinking  
You've finally got it made  
Bad news comes knocking  
At your garden gate  
Knocking for you  
Constant stranger  
You're a brute-you're an angel  
You can crawl-you can fly too  
It's down to you  
It all comes down to you

It's a long, long way from Canada  
A long way from snow chains  
Donkey vendors slicing coconut  
No parkas to their name  
Black babies covered in baking flour  
The cook's got a carnival song  
We're going to lay down someplace shady  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
Walter Raleigh and Chris Columbus  
Come marching out of the waves  
And claim the beach and all concessions  
In the name of the suntan slave  
I wrapped that flag around me  
Like a Dorothy Lamour sarong  
And I lay down thinking national  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
Good time Mary and a fortune hunter  
All dressed up to follow the drums  
Mary in a feather hula-hoop  
Miss Fortune with a rose on her big game gun  
All saints, all sinners shining  
Heed those trumpets all night long  
Propped up on a samba beat  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
Tar baby and the Great White Wonder  
Talking over a glass of rum  
Burning on the inside  
With the knowledge of things to come  
There's gambling out on the terrace  
And midnight ramblin' on the lawn  
As they lead toward temptation  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
In a plane flying back to winter  
In shoes full of tropic sand  
A lady in a foreign flag  
On the arm of her Marlboro Man  
The hawk howls in New York City  
Six foot drifts on Myrtle's lawn  
As they push the recline buttons down  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland  
  
La, la  
African sand on the trade winds  
And the sun on the Amazon  
As they push the reline buttons down  
With dreamland coming on  
Dreamland, dreamland  
Dreamland, dreamland

The Minus is loveless  
He talks to the land  
And the leaves fall  
And the pond over-ices  
She don't know the system, Plus  
She don't understand  
She's got all the wrong fuses and splices  
She's not going to fix it up  
Too easy  
  
The masking tape tangles  
It's sticky and black  
And the copper  
Proud headed Queen Lizzie  
Conducts little charges  
That don't get charged back  
Well the technical manual's busy  
She's not going to fix it up too easy  
And she holds out her flashlight  
And she shines it on me  
She wants me to tell her  
What the trouble might be  
Well I'm learning  
It's peaceful  
With a good dog and some trees  
Out of touch with the breakdown  
Of this century  
They're not going to fix it up  
Too easy  
  
We once loved-together  
And we floodlit that time  
Input-output-electricity  
But the lines overloaded  
And the sparks started flying  
And the loose wires  
Were lashing out at me  
She's not going to fix that up  
Too easy  
But she holds out her candle  
And she shines it in  
And she begs him to show her  
How to fix it again  
While the song that he sang her  
To soothe her to sleep  
Runs all through her circuits  
Like a heartbeat  
She's not going to fix it up  
Too easy

Hot winds and hunger cries--Ethiopia  
Flies in your babies' eyes--Ethiopia  
Walking sticks on burning plains  
Betrayed by politics  
Abandoned by the rains  
On and on, the human need  
On and on, the human greed profanes  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Your top soil flies away--Ethiopia  
We pump ours full of poison spray--Ethiopia  
Between the brown skies and sprinkling lawns  
I hear the whine of chain saws  
Hacking rain forests down  
On and on, insanities  
On and on, short sighted greed abounds  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Little garden planet-oasis in space  
Some hearts hurt, they can hardly stand it  
Famine phantoms at the garden gates  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Every Sunday on T.V. Ethiopia  
You suffer with such dignity Ethiopia  
A T.V. star with a P.R. smile  
Calls your baby "it" while strolling  
Through your tragic trials  
On and on, stupidity  
On and on, the basic needs are defiled  
Good air, good water, good earth  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia  
  
Little garden planet, oasis in space  
Some hearts hurt, they can hardly stand the waste  
Ethiopia, Ethiopia, Ethiopia

I slept last night in a good hotel  
I went shopping today for jewels  
The wind rushed around in the dirty town  
And the children let out from the schools  
I was standing on a noisy corner  
Waiting for the walking green  
Across the street he stood  
And he played real good  
On his clarinet, for free  
  
Now me I play for fortunes  
And those velvet curtain calls  
I've got a black limousine  
And two gentlemen  
Escorting me to the halls  
And I play if you have the money  
Or if you're a friend to me  
But the one man band  
By the quick lunch stand  
He was playing real good, for free  
  
Nobody stopped to hear him  
Though he played so sweet and high  
They knew he had never  
Been on their T.V.  
So they passed his music by  
I meant to go over and ask for a song  
Maybe put on a harmony...  
I heard his refrain  
As the signal changed  
He was playing real good, for free

I heard it in the wind last night  
It sounded like applause  
Did you get a round resounding for you  
Way up here  
It seems like many dim years ago  
Since I heard that face to face  
Or seen you face to face  
Though tonight I can feel you here  
I get these notes  
On butterflies and lilac sprays  
From girls who just have to tell me  
They saw you somewhere  
  
In some office sits a poet  
And he trembles as he sings  
And he asks some guy  
To circulate his soul around  
On your mark red ribbon runner  
The caressing rev of motors  
Finely tuned like fancy women  
In thirties evening gowns  
Up the charts  
Off to the airport-  
Your name's in the news  
Everything's first class-  
The lights go down-  
And it's just you up there  
Getting them to feel like that  
  
Remember the days when you used to sit  
And make up your tunes for love  
And pour your simple sorrow  
To the sound hole and your knee  
And now you're seen  
On giant screens  
And at parties for the press  
And for people who have slices of you  
From the company  
They toss around your latest golden egg  
Speculation-well, who's to know  
If the next one in the nest  
Will glitter for them so  
  
I guess I seem ungrateful  
With my teeth sunk in the hand  
That brings me things  
I really can't give up just yet  
Now I sit up here  
The critic!  
And they introduce some band  
But they seem so much confetti  
Looking at them on my TV set  
Oh the power and the glory  
Just when you're getting a taste for worship  
They start bringing out the hammers  
And the boards  
And the nails  
  
I heard it in the wind last night  
It sounded like applause  
Chilly now  
End of summer  
No more shiny hot nights  
It was just the arbutus rustling  
And the bumping of the logs  
And the moon swept down black water  
Like an empty spotlight

"The way I see it," he said  
"You just can't win it  
Everybody's in it for their own gain  
You can't please 'em all  
There's always somebody calling you down  
  
I do my best  
And I do good business  
There's a lot of people asking for my time  
They're trying to get ahead  
They're trying to be a good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
There was nobody calling me up for favors  
  
And no one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow  
But for the work I've taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song  
I deal in dreamers  
And telephone screamers  
Lately I wonder what I do it for  
If l had my way  
I'd just walk out those doors  
  
And wander  
Down the Champs Elysees  
Going cafe to cabaret  
Thinking how I'll feel when I find  
That very good friend of mine  
I was a free man in Paris  
I felt unfettered and alive  
Nobody was calling me up for favors  
No one's future to decide  
You know I'd go back there tomorrow  
  
But for the work I've taken on  
Stoking the star maker machinery  
Behind the popular song.

Old Beale Street is coming down  
Sweeties' Snack Bar, boarded up now  
And Eagles The Tailor and the Shine Boy's gone  
Faded out with ragtime blues  
Handy's cast in bronze  
And he's standing in a little park  
With a trumpet in his hand  
Like he's listening back to the good old bands  
And the click of high heeled shoes  
Old Furry sings the blues  
Propped up in his bed  
With his dentures and his leg removed  
And Ginny's there  
For her kindness and Furry's beer  
She's the old man's angel overseer  
  
Pawn shops glitter like gold tooth caps  
In the gray decay  
They chew the last few dollars off  
Old Beale Street's carcass  
Carrion and mercy  
Blue and silver sparkling drums  
Cheap guitars, eye shades and guns  
Aimed at the hot blood of being no one  
Down and out in Memphis Tennessee  
Old Furry sings the blues  
You bring him smoke and drink and he'll play for you  
It's mostly muttering now and sideshow spiel  
But there was one song he played  
I could really feel  
  
There's a double bill murder at the New Daisy  
The old girl's silent across the street  
She's silent, waiting for the wrecker's beat  
Silent, staring are her stolen name  
Diamond boys and satin dolls  
Bourbon laughter, ghosts, history falls  
To parking lots and shopping malls  
As they tear down old Beale Street  
Old Furry sings the blues  
He points a bony finger at you and  
"I don't like you"  
Everybody laughs as if it's the old man's standard joke  
But it's true  
We're only welcome for our drink and smoke  
  
W.C. Handy I'm rich and I'm fay  
And I'm not familiar with what you played  
But I get such strong impressions of your hey day  
Looking up and down old Beale Street  
Ghosts of the darktown society  
Come right out of the bricks at me  
Like it's a Saturday night  
They're in their finery  
Dancing it up and making deals  
Furry sings the blues  
Why should I expect that old guy to give it to me true  
Fallen to hard luck  
And time and other thieves  
While our limo is shining on his shanty street  
Old Furry sings the blues

Write me a royal-blue parchment poem  
Draw me a royal-blue lady like me  
Draw me a smile  
That's a lot like my own  
And make my eyes flowers  
And make my mind see  
I will weave melodies only for you  
And color them silver and saffron and blue  
  
Build me a window to watch everything  
Leave it unshuttered so nothing slips by  
No season, no sorrow, no wonderful thing  
No raspberry, strawberry sun in the sky  
I will bring music and marsipan bars  
And live deep inside you  
Wherever you are  
  
Teach me the ways of the Gemini twin  
Show me the love that he says without words  
Bring me his laughter again and again  
The silence is singing, the quiet is heard  
I will find harmonies waiting unsung  
With two souls to sing them  
Where once there was one

He is three  
One's in the middle unmoved  
Waiting  
To show what he sees  
To the other two  
To the one attacking--so afraid  
And the one that keeps trying to love and trust  
And getting himself betrayed  
In the plan--oh  
The divine plan  
God must be a boogie man!  
  
One's so sweet  
So overly loving and gentle  
He lets people in  
To his innermost sacred temple  
Blind faith to care  
Blind rage to kill  
Why'd he let them talk him down  
To cheap work and cheap thrills  
In the plan, oh  
The insulting plan  
God must be a boogie man!  
  
Which would it be  
Mingus one or two or three  
Which one do you think he'd want the world to see  
Well, world opinion's not a lot of help  
When a man's only trying to find out  
How to feel about himself!  
In the plan-oh  
The cock-eyed plan  
God must be a boogie man!

At the far end of the midway  
By the double Ferris wheel  
There's a band that plays so snakey  
You can't help how you feel  
Emmie Mae ran away  
With a man as dark as night  
You can see him, if you go there  
Second trumpet to the right  
  
They play "Night Train"  
So snaky  
Black girls dancing  
Long and lanky  
Barkers barking  
Step right up, folks!  
The show is about to begin  
It's Harlem in Havana time  
Step right in!  
Silver spangles  
See 'em dangle in the farm boy's eyes  
Hootchie kootchie  
Auntie Ruthie would've cried  
If she knew we were on the inside.  
  
When Emmie Mae ran away  
She came back a bottle blond  
God! The gossips had a gourmet feast  
Chomping on how she was born  
But miracle of miracles  
'cause we were underage  
She got us nearly front row seats  
To the right side of the stage  
See that tall girl?  
That's a man  
That one, too  
Big yellow feather fan  
Barkers barking  
Step right up, folks!  
The show is about to begin  
It's Harlem in Havana time  
Step right in!  
Silver spangles  
See 'em dangle in the farm boy's eyes  
Hootchie kootchie  
Auntie Ruthie would've died  
If she knew we were on the inside.

Heatwaves on the runway  
As the wheels set down  
He takes his baggage off the carousel  
He takes a taxi into town  
Yellow schools of taxi fishes  
Jonah in a ticking whale  
Caught up at the light in the fishnet windows  
Of Bloomingdale's  
Watching those high fashion girls  
Skinny black models with Raven curls  
Beauty parlor blonds with credit card eyes  
Looking for the chic and the fancy  
To buy  
  
He opens up his suitcase  
In the continental suite  
And people thirty stories down  
Colored currents in the street  
A helicopter lands on the Pan Am roof  
Like a dragonfly on a tomb  
And business men in button downs  
Press into conference rooms  
Battalions of paper-minded males  
Talking commodities and sales  
While at home their paper wives  
And paper kids  
Paper the walls to keep their gut reactions hid  
  
Yellow checkers for the kitchen  
Climbing ivy for the bath  
She is lost in House and Gardens  
He's caught up in Chief of Staff  
He drifts off into the memory  
Of the way she looked in school  
With her body oiled and shining  
At the public swimming pool  
  
The more I'm with you, pretty baby  
The more I feel my love increase  
I'm building all my dreams around you  
Our happiness will never cease  
Cause nothing's any good without you  
Baby you're my centerpiece  
  
We'll find a house and garden somewhere  
Along a country road a piece  
A little cottage on the outskirts  
Where we can really find release  
Cause nothing's any good without you  
Baby you're my centerpiece  
  
Shining hair and shining skin  
Shining as she reeled him in  
To tell him like she did today  
Just what he could do with Harry's House  
And Harry's take home pay

Help me  
I think I'm falling  
In love again  
When I get that crazy feeling, I know  
I'm in trouble again  
I'm in trouble  
  
'Cause you're a rambler and a gambler  
And a sweet-taIking-ladies man  
And you love your lovin'  
But not like you love your freedom  
  
Help me  
I think I'm falling  
In love too fast  
It's got me hoping for the future  
And worrying about the past  
'Cause I've seen some hot hot blazes  
Come down to smoke and ash  
We love our lovin'  
  
But not like we love our freedom  
Didn't it feel good  
We were sitting there talking  
Or lying there not talking  
Didn't it feel good  
You dance with the lady  
With the hole in her stocking  
  
Didn't it feel good  
Didn't it feel good  
Help me  
I think I'm falling  
In love with you  
  
Are you going to let me go there by myself  
That's such a lonely thing to do  
Both of us flirting around  
Flirting and flirting  
  
Hurting too  
We love our lovin'  
But not like we love our freedom

The sleepless nights  
The daily fights  
The quick toboggan when you reach the heights  
I miss the kisses and I miss the bites  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The broken dates  
The endless waits  
The lovely loving and the hateful hates  
The conversations with the flying plates  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more pain  
No no more strain  
Now I'm sane  
But I'd rather be punch drunk  
  
The flying fur of cat and cur  
The fine mismatching of a him and her  
I've learned my lesson but  
I wish I were in love again  
  
The furtive sigh  
The blackened eye  
The words I love you 'til the day I die  
The self-deception that believes that lie  
I wish I were in love again  
  
When love congeals  
It soon reveals  
The faint aroma of performing seals  
The double-crossing of a pair of heels  
I wish I were in love again  
  
No more care  
No more despair  
Now I'm all there  
But I'd rather be punch drunk  
  
Believe me sir, I much prefer  
The classic battle of a him and her  
I don't like quiet and I wish I were  
In love again  
In love again

If you can keep your head  
While all about you  
People are losing theirs and blaming you  
If you can trust yourself  
When everybody doubts you  
And make allowance for their doubting too.  
  
If you can wait  
And not get tired of waiting  
And when lied about  
Stand tall  
Don't deal in lies  
And when hated  
Don't give in to hating back  
Don't need to look so good  
Don't need to talk too wise.  
  
If you can dream  
And not make dreams your master  
If you can think  
And not make intellect your game  
If you can meet  
With triumph and disaster  
And treat those two imposters just the same  
  
If you can force your heart  
And nerve and sinew  
To serve you  
After all of them are gone  
And so hold on  
When there is nothing in you  
Nothing but the will  
That's telling you to hold on!  
Hold on!  
  
If you can bear to hear  
The truth you've spoken  
Twisted and misconstrued  
By some smug fool  
Or watch your life's work  
Torn apart and broken down  
And still stoop to build again  
With worn out tools.  
  
If you can draw a crowd  
And keep your virtue  
Or walk with Kings  
And keep the common touch  
If neither enemies nor loving friends  
Can hurt you  
If everybody counts with you  
But none too much.  
  
If you can fill the journey  
Of a minute  
With sixty seconds worth of wonder and delight  
Then  
The Earth is yours  
And Everything that's in it  
But more than that  
I know  
You'll be alright  
You'll be alright.  
  
Cause you've got the fight  
You've got the insight  
You've got the fight  
You've got the insight

Holy war  
Genocide  
Suicide  
Hate and cruelty...  
How can this be holy?  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
  
These ancient tales...  
The good go to heaven  
And the wicked ones burn in hell...  
Ring the funeral bells!  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
  
There's just too many people now  
Too little land  
Much too much desire  
You feel so feeble now  
It's so out of hand  
Big bombs and barbed wire  
We've set our lovely sky  
Our lovely sky  
On fire!  
  
There's just too many people now  
And too little land  
Too much rage and desire  
It makes you feel so feeble now  
It's so out of hand-  
Big bombs and barbed wire...  
Can't you see  
Our destiny?  
We are making this Earth  
Our funeral pyre!  
  
Holy Earth  
How can we heal you?  
We cover you like a blight...  
Strange birds of appetite...  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
If I had a heart I'd cry.  
If I had a heart I'd cry.

Downtown  
My darling dime store thief  
In the War of Independence  
Rock 'n Roll rang sweet as victory  
Under neon signs  
A girl was in bloom  
And a woman was fading  
In a suburban room  
I said, "Take me to the dance"  
"Do you want to dance?"  
"I love to dance"  
And I told him, "They don't take chances  
They seem so removed from romance"  
"They've been broken in churches and schools  
And molded to middle class circumstance"  
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling  
  
Downtown  
The dance halls and cafes  
Feel so wild you could break somebody's heart  
Just doing the latest dance craze  
Gail and Louise  
In those push-up brassieres  
Tight dresses and rhinestone rings  
Drinking up the band's beers  
Young love was kissing under bridges  
Kissing in cars, kissing in cafes  
And we were walking down Main Street  
Kisses like bright flags hung on holidays  
"In France they kiss on Main Street"  
"Amour, mama, not cheap display"  
And we were rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling  
  
Downtown  
In the pinball arcade  
With his head full of pool hall pitches  
And songs from the hit parade  
He'd be singing "Bye, Bye, Love"  
While he's racking up his free play  
Let those rock 'n roll choir boys  
Come and carry us away  
Sometimes Chickie had the car  
Or Ron had a car  
Or Lead Foot Melvin with his hot-wire head  
We'd all go looking for a party  
Looking to raise Jesus up from the dead  
And I'd be kissing in the back seat  
Thrilling to the Brando-like things that he said  
And we'd be rolling, rolling, rock n' rolling

Although I speak in tongues  
Of men and angels  
I'm just sounding brass  
And tinkling cymbals without love-  
  
Love suffers long-  
Love is kind!-  
Enduring all things-  
Love has no evil in mind  
  
If I had the gift of prophecy-  
And all the knowledge-  
And the faith to move the mountains  
Even if I understood all of the mysteries-  
If I didn't have love  
I'd be nothing  
  
Love-never looks for love-  
Love's not puffed up-  
Or envious-  
Or touchy-  
Because it rejoices in the truth  
Not in iniquity  
Love sees like a child sees  
  
As a child I spoke as a child-  
I thought and I understood as a child-  
But when I became a woman-  
I put away childish things  
And began to see through a glass darkly  
  
Where, as a child, I saw it face to face  
Now, I only know it in part  
Fractions in me  
Of faith and hope and love  
And of these great three  
Love's the greatest beauty  
Love  
Love  
Love

The firmament of Tinsel Town  
Is strung with tungsten stars  
Lot's of forty watt successes  
He says, "Where's my own shining hour?"  
He's the well kept secret of the underground  
He's in debt to the company store  
Because his only channeled aspiration  
Was getting back that girl he had before  
He's got stacks and stacks of words that rhyme  
Describing what it is to lose  
He's got some just for laughs, he's got some for love  
That mainline to his blues  
Some to shed a little light  
On you and on me  
Some to shed a little light  
On a human story  
The wars of pride and property  
The rebel Irish and the promised land Jew  
Fighting behind his eyes and over seas  
Wounded in action and no ceasefire in view  
Brave reporters bring the battles home  
But tonight inside that box  
Just more bang-bang ketchup color to him  
Just more Twentieth Century Fox  
All because that ghostly girl comes haunting  
Just out of reach outside his bed  
She kicks the covers off of his sleep  
For the clumsy things he said  
She commands his head  
She tries his sanity  
She demands his head  
Tonight unknowingly  
Vaguely she floats and lacelike  
Blown in like a curtain on the night wind  
She's nebulous and naked  
He wonders where she's been  
He grabs at the air because there's nothing there  
Her evasiveness stings him now  
With long legs, long lonely legs  
Bruised from banging into things  
One day he was standing just outside her door  
He was carrying an armload of bright balloons  
She just laughed  
She said she heard him knocking  
And she teased him for the moon  
"Is one the moon, dear clown  
Tied to a string for me?"  
He tried but he could not get it down  
For truth or mystery  
He tried but he could not get it down  
For love or money  

I'm a lucky girl  
I found my friend  
I've been all around the world  
Mission Impossible  
Chasing the rainbow's end  
Wise guys  
Shy guys  
And sly lover boys  
With big bad bedroom eyes  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
'Til I loved you  
  
You're my lucky star  
You're my magician  
You make the night prowling disappear  
Vanished from the star-war-bars  
Empty repetition  
I get my heart full here  
Playboys  
Stray boys  
And "Say, hey, hey" boys'll treat you like a toy  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
'Til I loved you  
  
Cheaters  
Woman beaters  
And Huck Finn shucksters hopping parking meters  
I never loved a man  
I trusted  
As far as I could pitch my shoe  
'til I loved you  
  
I'm a lucky girl  
I found my friend  
I been all around the world  
Mission Impossible  
Chasing the rainbow's end  
Wise guys  
Booby-prize guys  
And sly lover boys  
With big bad bedroom eyes  
I never loved a man I trusted  
As far as I could throw my shoe  
'Til I loved you

No demands  
Just pleasurable sensations  
Hand in hand  
No far reaching plans  
No, no-hand in hand  
Well I keep on trying to understand  
Daylight bright  
How come I keep moving  
From man to man to man?  
Giving my sweet love,  
Tasting sweet love,  
Woman to man  
  
Sometimes it's easy  
You drift with the empty gladness  
Like it all belongs  
Sometimes it's low down sadness  
Like it's all gone so wrong  
When I saw you standing there  
I said to myself  
M-m-m here's a place  
I could break down and care  
I'll give him my sweet love,  
Taste his sweet love,  
Real sweet love,  
Woman to man  
  
I don't like to lie  
But I sure can be phony when I get scared  
I put my nose up in the air  
Stoney, stoney when I get scared  
When I saw you standing there  
I was scared  
I thought  
Oh, I hope he can care,  
I sure hope I can care,  
I hope we can really care,  
And share woman to man  
Cause I've been moving  
Man to man to man to man to man  
Oh what am I looking for?  
Man to man to man to man  
A lot of good guys gone through my door  
Man to man to man to man  
To man to man to man  
Man to man to man to man  
Woman to man

Marcie in a coat of flowers  
Steps inside a candy store  
Reds are sweet and greens are sour  
Still no letter at her door  
So she'll wash her flower curtains  
Hang them in the wind to dry  
Dust her tables with his shirt and  
Wave another day goodbye  
  
Marcie's faucet needs a plumber  
Marcie's sorrow needs a man  
Red is autumn green is summer  
Greens are turning and the sand  
All along the ocean beaches  
Stares up empty at the sky  
Marcie buys a bag of peaches  
Stops a postman passing by  
And summer goes  
Falls to the sidewalk like string and brown paper  
Winter blows  
Up from the river there's no one to take her  
To the sea  
  
Marcie dresses warm its snowing  
Takes a yellow cab uptown  
Red is stop and green's for going  
Sees a show and rides back down  
Down along the Hudson River  
Past the shipyards in the cold  
Still no letter's been delivered  
Still the winter days unfold  
Like magazines  
Fading in dusty grey attics and cellars  
Make a dream  
Dream back to summer and hear how  
He tells her  
Wait for me  
  
Marcie leaves and doesn't tell us  
Where or why she moved away  
Red is angry green is jealous  
That was all she had to say  
Someone thought they saw her Sunday  
Window shopping in the rain  
Someone heard she bought a one-way ticket  
And went west again

When morning comes to Morgantown  
The merchants roll their awnings down  
The milktrucks make their morning rounds  
In morning, Morgantown  
  
We'll rise up early, with the sun  
To ride the bus while everyone is yawning  
And the day is young  
In morning, Morgantown  
  
Morning Morgantown  
Buy your dreams a dollar down  
Morning any town you name  
Morning's just the same  
  
We'll find a table in the shade  
And sip our tea and lemonade  
And watch the morning on parade  
In morning, Morgantown  
  
Ladies in their rainbow fashions  
Colored stop and go lights flashing  
We'll wink at total strangers passing in  
Morning, Morgantown  
  
Morning Morgantown  
Buy your dreams a dollar down  
Morning any town you name  
Morning's just the same  
  
I'd like to buy you everything  
A wooden bird with painted wings  
A window full of colored rings  
In morning, Morgantown.  
  
But the only thing I have to give  
To make you smile, to win you with  
Are all the mornings still to live  
In morning, Morgantown

My old man  
He's a singer in the park  
He's a walker in the rain  
He's a dancer in the dark  
We don't need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
My old man  
Keeping away my blues  
  
He's my sunshine in the morning  
He's my fireworks at the end of the day  
He's the warmest chord I ever heard  
Play that warm chord, play and stay baby  
We don't need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
My old man  
Keeping away my blues  
  
But when he's gone  
Me and them lonesome blues collide  
The bed's too big  
The frying pan's too wide  
  
Then he comes home  
And he takes me in his loving arms  
And he tells me all his troubles  
And he tells me all my charms  
We don't need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
No, my old man  
Keeping away my blues  
  
But when he's gone  
Me and them lonesome blues collide  
The bed's too big  
The frying pan's too wide  
  
My old man  
He's a singer in the park  
He's a walker in the rain  
He's a dancer in the dark  
We don't need no piece of paper  
From the city hall  
Keeping us tied and true  
No, my old man  
Keeping away my lonesome blues

I'm going to take you to  
My special place  
It's a place that you  
Like no one else I know  
Might appreciate  
I don't go there with anyone--but  
You're a special case  
For my special place  
For my secret place  
  
People talk to tell you something  
Or to take up space  
Guess I'm only talking  
To be talking to  
Your pretty face  
I don't talk much to anyone, but  
You're a special case  
For my special place  
My secret place  
  
I was born and raised  
In New York City  
I'm just getting used to Colorado,  
Oh street bravado  
Carry me  
Why did you bring me to  
A place so wild and pretty?  
Are there pigeons in this park,  
Muggers after dark,  
In these golden trees,  
In the secret place?  
  
I'm going to take you to  
My special place  
It's a place no amount of hurt and anger  
Can deface  
I put things back together there  
It all falls right in place,  
In my special space  
My special place  
  
Once I saw a film  
In New York City  
That was shot in Colorado,  
Girl meets desperado  
In the trembling mountain trees  
Out of all of the girls that you see  
In bleachers and cafe windows  
Sitting, flirting with someone  
Looking to have some fun  
Why did you pick me?  
For the secret place

Light up light up  
Light up your lazy blue eyes  
Moon's up nights up  
Taking the town by surprise  
Night time night time  
Day left an hour ago  
City light time  
Must you get ready so slow  
There are places to come from and places to go  
  
Night in the city looks pretty to me  
Night in the city looks fine  
Music comes spilling out into the street  
Colors go flashing in time  
  
Take off take off  
Take off your stay-at-home shoes  
Break off shake off  
Chase off those stay-at-home blues  
Stairway stairway  
Down to the crowds in the street  
They go their way  
Looking for faces to greet  
But we run on laughing with no one to meet  
  
Night in the city looks pretty to me  
Night in the city looks fine  
Music comes spilling out into the street  
Colors go waltzing in time

The tour bus came yesterday  
The driver's a mess today  
It's a dump of a destiny  
But it's got a view...  
Now the kid in the see-through blouse  
Is moving in hard on his holy vows...  
Since the preacher's not dead  
Dead drunk will have to do!  
  
Night of the iguana  
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet  
Night of the iguana  
Can you hear the castanets?  
The widow is dancing  
Down on the beach  
  
The starlight is steaming  
He'd like to be dreaming  
His senses are screaming  
Not to be denied...  
But if the spell of the night should win  
He could lose his bus  
For the same sweet sin  
That took his church from him  
Then how will he survive?  
  
Night of the iguana  
The jasmine is so mercilessly sweet  
Night of the iguana  
Can you hear the castanets?  
It's the widow and her lover-boys  
Down on the beach  
  
The night is so fragrant  
These women so flagrant  
They could make him a vagrant  
With the flick of a shawl.  
The devil's in sweet sixteen  
The widow's good looking but she gets mean  
He's burning like Augustine  
With no help from God at all

The general offered  
No apologies  
He said "The soldiers erred in judgment  
They should have hired a hooker"  
No apologies  
to the outraged Japanese  
No "Sorry little girl"  
The pigs just took her  
Tire skids and teethmarks  
What happened to this place?  
Lawyers and loan sharks  
Are laying America to waste  
  
Freddie said that "Juan thinks, I think  
He's the devil"  
What a lofty title  
For such a petty little tyrant  
Bigger beasts abound  
And they kick this world around  
At this crazy speed  
With violence and greed  
Tire skids and teethmarks  
What happened to this place?  
Lawyers and loan sharks  
Are laying America to waste  
  
So what makes a man a man  
In these tough times  
As drug lords buy up the banks  
And warlords radiate the oceans  
Ecosystems fail  
Snakes and snails and puppy tails  
Are wagging in the womb  
Beneath the trampled moon  
Tire skids and teethmarks  
What happened to this place?  
Lawyers and loan sharks  
Are laying America to waste  
  
The general offered  
No apologies

The story hit the news  
From coast to coast  
They said you beat the girl  
You loved the most  
Your charitable acts  
Seemed out of place  
With the beauty  
With your fist marks on her face  
Your buddies all stood by  
They bet their fortunes  
And their fame  
That she was out of line  
And you were not to blame  
  
Six hundred thousand doctors  
Are putting on rubber gloves  
And they're poking  
At the miseries made of love  
They say they're learning  
How to spot  
The battered wives  
Among all the women  
They see bleeding through their lives  
I bleed,  
For your perversity,  
These red words that make a stain  
On your white-washed claim that  
She was out of line  
And you were not to blame  
  
I heard your baby say  
When he was only three  
"Daddy, let's get some girls  
One for you and one for me."  
His mother had the frailty  
You despise  
And the looks  
You love to drive to suicide  
Not one wet eye around  
Her lonely little grave  
Said, "He was out of line girl  
You were not to blame."

Maybe I'm just kidding myself when I say I love you  
I don't know  
Loving without trusting  
You get, frostbite and sunstroke  
I wish I felt nothing!  
You pimp, laughing and strutting her to my chartered seat  
Your old off night back street  
  
It's been stinger to stinger, darling  
It's been heart to heart  
You still keep me from finishing  
Any new love I start  
Now she's moved in with you  
She's keeping your house neat  
And your sheets sweet  
And I'm your off night back street  
  
I can feel your fingers  
Feeling my face  
There are some lines you put there  
And some you erase  
Maybe I'm just dramatizing  
I don't care  
It's home, it can be heaven  
When we play fair  
But these sentimental journeys  
Late at night  
High in some back room you're calling me  
To be your off night back street  
  
You give me such pleasure  
You bring me such pain  
Who left her long black hair  
In our bathtub drain?

[Instrumental]  
  
I stepped outside of my little house and stood barefoot on a rock. The pacific
ocean rolled towards me. Across the bay, a family of seals sprawled on the
kelp uncovered by the low tide. A blue heron honked overhead. All around the
house the wild roses were blooming. The air smelled sweet and salty and loud
with crows and bees. My house was clean. I had food in the fridge for a week.
I sat outside 'til the sun went down.  
  
That night the piano beckoned for the first time in ten years. My fingers
found these patterns which express what words could not. This song poured out
while a brown bear rummaged through my garbage cans.  
  
The song has seven verses constructed for the days of that happy week. On
Thursday the bear arrives.

A red sun came rolling down a grey sky  
And the frogs and dogs and night birds then  
Started up singing sweet country lullaby  
You see that patch of city lights-  
Somewhere in there's Cotton Avenue-  
That's where I'm going to take myself tonight  
With a spit shine on my dancing shoes  
  
If you got a place like that to go  
You just have to go there  
If you got no place special  
Well then, you just go no place special  
  
I guess it's just the summer in the young blood  
Ripe and juicy in the young blood  
Teasing to go down to ...  
Cotton Avenue  
To hear the shiny shiny music  
See all the shiny people dancing to it  
Anytime you go to ...  
Cotton Avenue  
  
If you got a place like that to go  
You know you got to go there  
If you got no place special  
Well then, you just go no place special  
  
You see that summer storm brewing in the southern sky  
By the time it hits here I'll be dancing high and dry  
To rhythm and blues  
On Cotton Avenue  
Poor boys'll be hanging around outside in the street  
They got all the latest words  
They're dancing to the latest beat  
While they're hustling and sizing you  
On Cotton Avenue  
  
If you got a place like that to go  
You just have to go there  
If you've got no place special  
Well my dear  
You just so no place ... special

Magdalene is trembling  
Like a washing on a line  
Trembling and gleaming  
Never before was a man so kind  
Never so redeeming  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Ecstasy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
I am up a sycamore  
Looking through the leaves  
A sinner of some position  
Who in the world can this heart healer be  
This magical physician  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Misery  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
Enter the multitudes  
The walking wounded  
They come to this diver of the heart  
Of the multitudes  
Thy kingdom come  
Thy will be done  
  
Oh, climb down, climb down he says to me  
From the middle of unrest  
They think is light is squandered  
But he sees a stray in the wilderness  
And i see how far I've wandered  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Apathy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)  
  
Enter the multitudes  
The walking wounded  
They come to this diver of the heart  
Of the multitudes  
Thy kingdom come  
Thy will be done  
  
Oh, all around the marketplace  
The buzzing of the flies  
The buzzing and the stinging  
Divinely barren  
And wickedly wise  
The killer nails are ringing  
  
Enter the multitudes  
In Exxon blue  
In radiation rose  
Tragedy  
Now you tell me  
Who you gonna get to do the dirty work  
When all the slaves are free?  
(who're you gonna get)

All the people at this party  
They've got a lot of style  
They've got stamps of many countries  
They've got passport smiles  
Some are friendly  
Some are cutting  
Some are watching it from the wings  
Some are standing in the centre  
Giving to get something  
  
Photo Beauty gets attention  
Then her eye paint's running down  
She's got a rose in her teeth  
And a Iampshade crown  
One minute she's so happy  
Then she's crying on someone's knee  
Saying laughing and crying  
You know it's the same release  
  
I told you when I met you  
I was crazy  
Cry for us all Beauty  
Cry for Eddie in the corner  
Thinking he's nobody  
And Jack behind his joker  
And stone-cold Grace behind her fan  
And me in my frightened silence  
Thinking I don't understand  
  
I feel like I'm sleeping  
Can you wake me  
You seem to have a broader sensibility  
I'm just living on nerves and feelings  
With a weak and a lazy mind  
And coming to peoples parties  
Fumbling deaf dumb and blind  
  
I wish I had more sense ot humor  
Keeping the sadness at bay  
Throwing the lightness on these things  
Laughing it all away  
Laughing it alI away  
Laughing it all away

It was a rainy night  
We took a taxi to your mother's home  
She went to Florida and left you  
With your father's gun, alone  
Upon her small white bed  
I fell into a dream  
You sat up all the night and watched me  
To see, who in the world I might be  
  
I am from the Sunday school  
I sing soprano in the upstairs choir  
You are a holy man  
On the F.M. radio  
I sat up all the night and watched thee  
To see, who in the world you might be.  
  
You called me beautiful  
You called your mother-she was very tanned  
So you packed your tent and you went  
To live out in the Arizona sand  
You are a refugee  
From a wealthy family  
You gave up all the golden factories  
To see, who in the world you might be

He was sitting in the lounge of the Empire Hotel  
He was drinking for diversion  
He was thinking for himself  
A little money riding on the Maple Leafs  
Along comes a lady in lacy sleeves  
She says let me sit down  
You know, drinkin' alone's a shame  
It's a shame it's a crying shame  
Look at those jokers  
Glued to that damn hockey game  
Hey honey-you've got lots of cash  
Bring us round a bottle  
And we'll have some laughs  
Gin's what I'm drinking  
I was raised on robbery  
  
I'm a pretty good cook  
I'm sitting on my groceries  
Come up to my kitchen  
I'll show you my best recipe  
I try and I try but I can't save a cent  
I'm up after midnight cooking  
Trying to make my rent  
I'm rough but I'm pleasin'  
I was raised on robbery  
  
We had a little money once  
They were pushing through a four lane highway  
Government gave us three thousand dollars  
You should have seen it fly away  
First he bought a '57 Biscayne  
He put it in the ditch  
He drunk up all the rest  
That son of a bitch  
His blood's bad whiskey  
I was raised on robbery  
  
You know you ain't bad looking  
I like the way you hold your drinks  
Come home with me honey  
I ain't asking for no full length mink  
Hey, where you going  
Don't go yet  
Your glass ain't empty and we just met  
You're mean when your loaded  
I was raised on robbery

It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
But it don't snow here  
It stays pretty green  
I'm going to make a lot of money  
Then I'm going to quit this crazy scene  
Oh I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
I made my baby cry  
  
He tried hard to help me  
You know, he put me at ease  
And he loved me so naughty  
Made me weak in the knees  
Oh, I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
I'm so hard to handle  
I'm selfish and I'm sad  
Now I've gone and lost the best baby  
That I ever had  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on  
  
Oh, I wish I had a river so long  
I would teach my feet to fly  
I wish I had a river  
I could skate away on  
I made my baby say goodbye  
  
It's coming on Christmas  
They're cutting down trees  
They're putting up reindeer  
And singing songs of joy and peace  
I wish I had a river I could skate away on

I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles  
I think of rain, I think of roses blue  
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble  
To see the place she's lately gotten to  
Gotten to, gotten to  
  
She's gotten to mysterious devotions  
She's gotten to the zodiac and Zen  
She's gotten into tarot cards and potions  
She's laying her religion on her friends  
On her friends, on her friends  
  
Friends who come to ask her for their future  
Friends who come to find they can't be friends  
Because of signs and seasons that don't suit her  
She'll prophesy your death, she won't say when  
Won't say when, won't say when  
  
When all the black cards come you cannot barter  
No, when all your stars are stacked you cannot win  
She'll shake her head and treat you like a martyr  
It is her blackest spell she puts you in  
Puts you in, puts you in  
  
In sorrow she can lure you where she wants you  
Inside your own self-pity there you swim  
In sinking down to drown her voice still haunts you  
And only with your laughter can you win  
Can you win, can you win  
  
You win the lasting laurels with your laughter  
It reaches like an arm before you sink  
To win the solitary truth you're after  
You dare not ask the priestess how to think  
How to think, how to think  
  
I think of tears, I think of rain on shingles  
I think of rain, I think of roses blue  
I think of Rose, my heart begins to tremble  
To see the place she's lately gotten to  
Gotten to, gotten to

Where are you now  
Are you in some hotel room  
Does it have a view?  
Are you caught in a crowd  
Or holding some honey  
Who came on to you?  
Why do you have to be so jive  
O.K. hang up the phone  
It hurts  
But something survives  
Though it's undermined  
I'd still like to see you sometime  
  
I'm feeling so good  
And my friends all tell me  
That I'm looking fine  
I run in the woods  
I spring from the boulders  
Like a mama lion  
I'm not ready to  
Change my name again  
But you know I'm not after  
A piece of your fortune  
And your fame  
'Cause I tasted mine  
I'd just like to see you sometime  
  
Pack your suspenders  
I'll come meet your plane  
No need to surrender  
I just want to see you again  
  
We're in for more rain  
I could sure use some sunshine on my apple trees  
It seems such a shame  
We start out so kind and end so heartlessly  
I couldn't take them all on then  
With a heedful of questions and hypes  
So when the hopes got so slim  
I just resigned  
But I'd still like to see you sometime  
I'd sure like to see you

Every picture has its shadows  
And it has some source of light  
Blindness, blindness and sight  
The perils of benefactors  
The blessings of parasites  
Blindness, blindness and sight  
Threatened by all things  
Devil of cruelty  
Drawn to all things  
Devil of delight  
Mythical devil of the ever-present laws  
Governing blindness, blindness and sight  
  
Suntans in reservation dining rooms  
Pale miners in their lantern rays  
Night, night and day  
Hostage smile on presidents  
Freedom scribbled in the subway  
It's like night, night and day  
Threatened by all things  
God of cruelty  
Drawn to all things  
God of delight  
Mythical god of the everlasting laws  
Governing day, day and night  
  
Critics of all expression  
Judges in black and white  
Saying it's wrong, saying it's right  
Compelled by prescribed standards  
Or some ideals we fight  
For wrong, wrong and right  
Threatened by all things  
Man of cruelty-mark of Cain  
Drawn to all things  
Man of delight-born again, born again  
Man of the laws, the ever-broken laws  
Governing wrong, wrong and right  
Governing wrong, wrong and right  
Wrong and right

Oh let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on Wall Street and Vegas  
Place your bets  
Shine on the fishermen  
With nothing in their nets  
Shine on rising oceans and evaporating seas  
Shine on our Frankenstein technologies  
Shine on science  
With its tunnel vision  
Shine on fertile farmland  
Buried under subdivisions  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on the dazzling darkness  
That restores us in deep sleep  
Shine on what we throw away  
And what we keep  
  
Shine on Reverend Pearson  
Who threw away  
The vain old God  
kept Dickens and Rembrandt and Beethoven  
And fresh plowed sod  
Shine on good earth, good air, good water  
And a safe place  
For kids to play  
Shine on bombs exploding  
Half a mile away  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on world-wide traffic jams  
Honking day and night  
Shine on another asshole  
Passing on the right!  
Shine on the red light runners  
Busy talking on their cell phones  
Shine on the Catholic Church  
And the prisons that it owns  
Shine on all the Churches  
They all love less and less  
Shine on a hopeful girl  
In a dreamy dress  
  
Let your little light shine  
Let your little light shine  
Shine on good humor  
Shine on good will  
Shine on lousy leadership  
Licensed to kill  
Shine on dying soldiers  
In patriotic pain  
Shine on mass destruction  
In some God's name!  
Shine on the pioneers  
Those seekers of mental health  
Craving simplicity  
They traveled inward  
Past themselves...  
May all their little lights shine

Sisotowbell Lane  
Noah is fixing the pump in the rain  
He brings us no shame  
We always knew that he always knew  
Up over the hill  
Jovial neighbors come down when they will  
With stories to tell  
Sometimes they do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Each of us rocks his share  
Eating muffin buns and berries  
By the steamy kitchen window  
Sometimes we do  
Our tongues turn blue  
  
Sisotowbell Lane  
Anywhere else now would seem very strange  
The seasons are changing  
Everyday in everyway  
Sometimes it is spring  
Sometimes it is not anything  
A poet can sing  
Sometimes we try  
Yes we always try  
We have a rocking chair  
Somedays we rock and stare  
At the woodlands and the grasslands and the badlands 'cross the river  
Sometimes we do  
We like the view  
  
Sisotowbell Lane  
Go to the city you'll come back again  
To wade through the grain  
You always do  
Yes we always do  
Come back to the stars  
Sweet well water and pickling jars  
We'll lend you the car  
We always do  
Yes sometimes we do  
We have a rocking chair  
Someone is always there  
Rocking rhythms while they're waiting with the candle in the window  
Sometimes we do  
We wait for you

Turning and turning  
Within the widening gyre  
The falcon cannot hear the falconer  
Things fall apart  
The center cannot hold  
And a blood dimmed tide  
Is loosed upon the world  
  
Nothing is sacred  
The ceremony sinks  
Innocence is drowned  
In anarchy  
The best lack conviction  
Given some time to think  
And the worst are full of passion  
Without mercy  
  
Surely some revelation is at hand  
Surely it's the second coming  
And the wrath has finally taken form  
For what is this rough beast  
Its hour come at last  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
  
Hoping and hoping  
As if by my weak faith  
The spirit of this world  
Would heal and rise  
Vast are the shadows  
That straddle and strafe  
And struggle in the darkness  
Troubling my eyes  
  
Shaped like a lion  
It has the head of a man  
With a gaze as blank  
And pitiless as the sun  
And it's moving its slow thighs  
Across the desert sands  
Through dark indignant  
Reeling falcons  
  
Surely some revelation is at hand  
Surely it's the second coming  
And the wrath has finally taken form  
For what is this rough beast  
Its hour come at last  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
  
Raging and raging  
It rises from the deep  
Opening its eyes  
After twenty centuries  
Vexed to a nightmare  
Out of a stony sleep  
By a rocking cradle  
By the Sea of Galilee  
  
Surely some revelation is at hand  
Surely it's the second coming  
And the wrath has finally taken form  
For what is this rough beast  
Its hour come at last  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born  
Slouching towards Bethlehem to be born

We got a break  
Unbelievable  
We got a break  
Right in the middle of this  
Hollywood heartache  
We got this solid love  
All around the town  
Good hearts are going under  
Love bandits con and plunder  
Let nobody put asunder this solid love  
  
We got a chance  
Hot dog darlin'  
We got a chance  
No more, no more  
Fly-by-night romance  
We got this solid love  
Love has always made me  
Feel so uneasy  
I couldn't relax and just be me  
More like some strange disease  
Than this solid love  
  
Tested and blessed, darlin'  
I'm gonna give you my very best  
You're my hope  
You're my happiness  
You  
Open my heart you do  
You open my heart  
You do  
Yes you do

Sometimes I'm happy  
Sometimes I'm blue  
My disposition depends on you  
I never mind the rain from the skies  
As long as I have the sun in your eyes  
  
Sometimes I love you  
Sometimes I hate you  
When I hate you  
It's because I love you  
That's how I am  
So what can I do  
I'm happy when I'm with you

I went to Staten Island.  
To buy myself a mandolin  
And I saw the long white dress of love  
On a storefront mannequin  
Big boat chuggin' back with a belly full of cars,  
All for something lacy  
Some girl's going to see that dress  
And crave that day like crazy  
  
Little Indian kids on a bridge up in Canada  
They can balance and they can climb  
Like their fathers before them  
They'll walk the girders of the Manhattan skyline  
Shine your light on me Miss Liberty  
Because as soon as this ferry boat docks  
I'm headed to the church  
To play Bingo  
Fleece me with the gamblers' flocks  
  
I can keep my cool at poker  
But I'm a fool when love's at stake  
Because I can't conceal emotion  
What I'm feeling's always written on my face  
There's a gypsy down on Bleecker Street  
I went in to see her as a kind of joke  
And she lit a candle for my love luck  
And eighteen bucks went up in smoke  
  
Sharon, I left my man  
At a North Dakota junction  
And I came out to the "Big Apple" here  
To face the dream's malfunction  
Love's a repetitious danger  
You'd think I'd be accustomed to  
Well, I do accept the changes  
At least better than I used to do  
  
A woman I knew just drowned herself  
The well was deep and muddy  
She was just shaking off futility  
Or punishing somebody  
My friends were calling up all day yesterday  
All emotions and abstractions  
It seems we all live so close to that line  
And so far from satisfaction  
  
Dora says, "Have children!"  
Mama and Betsy say-"Find yourself a charity."  
Help the needy and the crippled or put some time into Ecology."  
Well, there's a wide wide world of noble causes  
And lovely landscapes to discover  
But all I really want right now  
Is, find another lover  
  
When we were kids in Maidstone, Sharon  
I went to every wedding in that little town  
To see the tears and the kisses  
And the pretty lady in the white lace wedding gown  
And walking home on the railroad tracks  
Or swinging on the playground swing  
Love stimulated my illusions  
More than anything  
  
And when I went skating after Golden Reggie  
You know it was white lace I was chasing  
Chasing dreams  
Mama's nylons underneath my cowgirl jeans  
He showed me first you get the kisses  
And then you get the tears  
But the ceremony of the bells and lace  
Still veils this reckless fool here  
  
Now there are 29 skaters on Wolmann rink  
Circling in singles and in pairs  
In this vigorous anonymity  
A blank face at the window stares and stares and stares and stares  
And the power of reason  
And the flowers of deep feeling  
Seem to serve me  
Only to deceive me  
  
Sharon you've got a husband  
And a family and a farm  
I've got the apple of temptation  
And a diamond snake around my arm  
But you still have your music  
And I've still got my eyes on the land and the sky  
You sing for your friends and your family  
I'll walk green pastures by and by

Through the windless wells of wonder  
By the throbbing light machine  
In a tea leaf trance or under  
Orders from the king and queen  
  
Songs to aging children come  
Aging children, I am one  
  
People hurry by so quickly  
Don't they hear the melodies  
In the chiming and the clicking  
And the laughing harmonies  
  
Songs to aging children come  
Aging children, I am one  
  
Some come dark and strange like dying  
Crows and ravens whistling  
Lines of weeping, strings of crying  
So much said in listening  
  
Songs to aging children come  
Aging children, I am one  
  
Does the moon play only silver  
When it strums the galaxy  
Dying roses will they will their  
Perfumed rhapsodies to me  
  
Songs to aging children came  
This is one

This is really something  
People will be envious  
But our roles aren't clear  
So we mustn't rush  
Still, we're burning brightly  
Clinging like fire to fuel  
I'm grinning like a fool  
Stay in touch  
We should stay in touch  
Oh! Stay in touch  
In touch  
  
Part of this is permanent  
Part of this is passing  
So we must be loyal and wary  
Not to give away too much  
Til we build a firm foundation  
And empty out old habits  
Old habits  
Stay in touch  
We should stay in touch  
Oh! Stay in touch  
In touch  
  
During times like these  
The wise or influential  
They can bear the imperfections  
They can keep the money  
No doubt about it  
No doubt that's essential  
No doubt that's always been a tricky one for me  
So, we should just surrender  
Let fate and duty shape us  
Let light hearts remake us  
Let the worries hush  
In the middle of this continent  
In the middle of our time on Earth  
We perceive one another  
Stay in touch  
We should stay in touch  
Oh! Stay in touch  
In touch

Don't know why  
There's no sun up in the sky  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps rainin' all of the time  
  
Life is bare  
Gloom and misery everywhere  
Stormy weather  
Just can't get my poor self together  
I'm weary all the time  
All the time  
  
So weary all of the time  
When you went away  
The blues stepped up and met me  
If he's gone to stay  
That old rocking chair's going to get me  
Every night I pray  
That the lord above will let me  
Walk in the sunlight once more  
  
I can't go on  
Everything I had is gone  
Stormy weather  
Since my man and I ain't together  
Keeps rainin' all of the time  
  
Keeps rainin' all of the time

Out on some borderline  
Some mark of in between  
I lay down golden-in time  
And woke up vanishing  
  
Sweet bird you are  
Briefer than a falling star  
All these vain promises on beauty jars  
Somewhere with your wings on time  
You must be laughing  
Behind our eyes  
Calendars of our lives  
Circled with compromise  
Sweet bird of time and change  
You must be laughing  
Up on your feathers laughing  
  
Golden in time  
Cities under the sand  
Power, ideals and beauty  
Fading in everyone's hand  
  
Give me some time  
I feel like I'm losing mine  
Out here on this horizon line  
With the earth spinning  
And the sky forever rushing  
No one knows  
They can never get that close  
Guesses at most  
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching  
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching  
Guesses based on what each set of time and change is touching

I almost closed the door  
Cancelled on everything we opened up for  
Tonight the shadows had their say  
Their sad notions of the way  
Things really are  
Damn these blues!  
They'd turn my heart against you  
Since I was fool enough  
To find romance  
I'm trying to convince myself  
This is just a dance!  
  
We move in measures  
Through loves' changing faces  
Needy and nonchalant  
Greedy and gracious  
Through petty dismissals  
And grand embraces  
Like it was only a dance!  
  
We are survivors  
Some get broken  
Some get mended  
Some can't surrender  
They're too well defended  
Some get lucky  
Some are blessed  
And some pretend  
This is only a dance!  
  
We're dancing fools  
You and me  
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity  
It's my solo  
While you're away  
Shadows have the saddest thing to say  
  
Love  
We can't live without it  
Why do we go out and get it  
Just to turn around and doubt it  
LIke we're scared to care  
It's hard to talk about it  
Aw--it's only a dance  
Tonight the shadows had their say  
There's a sucker born a day  
I heard them say  
Born to lose  
Am I a sucker to love you?  
  
You're such a sweet love  
You're a proud man  
You're a treasure  
Time passes gracefully  
Living can be such a pleasure  
You make it easy to take it in measures  
Like it was only a dance!  
  
We're dancing fools  
You and me  
Tonight it's a dance of insecurity  
It's my solo  
Blue way  
And shadows have the saddest things to say  
  
We are survivors  
Some get broken  
Some get mended  
Some can't surrender  
They're too well defended  
Some get lucky  
Some are blessed  
And some pretend  
It's only a dance!

There was a moon and a street lamp  
I didn't know I drank such a lot  
'Till I pissed a tequila-anaconda  
The full length of the parking lot!  
Oh, I talk too loose  
Again I talk too open and free  
I pay a high price for my open talking  
Like you do for your silent mystery  
  
Come and talk to me  
Please talk to me  
Talk to me, talk to me  
Mr. Mystery  
  
We could talk about Martha  
We could talk about landscapes  
I'm not above gossip  
But I'll sit on a secret where honor is at stake!  
Or we could talk about power  
About Jesus and Hitler and Howard Hughes  
Or Charlie Chaplin's movies  
Or Bergman's nordic blues  
Please just talk to me  
Any old theme you choose  
Just come and talk to me  
Mr. Mystery, talk to me  
  
You could talk like a fool-I'd listen  
You could talk like a sage  
Anyway the best of my mind  
All goes down on the strings and the page  
That mind picks up all these pictures  
It still gets my feet up to dance  
Even though it's covered with keyloids  
From the "slings and arrows of outrageous romance"  
I stole that from Willy the Shake!  
You know, "Neither a borrower nor a lender be"  
Romeo, Romeo talk to me!  
  
Is your silence that golden?  
Are you comfortable in it?  
Is it the key to your freedom  
Or is it the bars on your prison?  
Are you gagged by your ribbons?  
Are you really exclusive or just miserly?  
You spend every sentence as if it was marked currency!  
Come and spend some on me,  
Shut me up and talk to me!  
I'm always talking!  
Chicken squawking!  
Please talk to me

I stepped outside to breathe the air  
And stare up at the stars  
Big dipper hanging there  
Over the rented car  
Over the rented car  
I'm a runaway from the record biz  
From the hoods in the hood and the whiny white kids  
Boring!  
The old man is snoring  
And I'm taming the tiger  
(You can't tame the tiger)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
Nice, kitty kitty  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
  
Sophia says "It's hard to catch  
And harder still to ride  
The time to watch the beast the best  
Is when it's purring at your side"  
Purring at your side  
Accolades and honors  
One false move and you're a goner  
Boring!  
The old man is snoring  
And I'm taming the tiger  
(You can't tame the tiger)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
Nice, kitty kitty  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
In the forest of the night  
  
The moon shed light  
On my hopeless plight  
As the radio blared so bland  
Every disc, a poker chip  
Every song just a one night stand  
Formula music, girly guile  
Genuine junk food for juveniles  
Up and down the dial  
Mercenary style  
  
I watched the stars chuck down their spears  
And a plane went blinking by  
And I thought of Anna  
Wild and dear  
Like fireworks in the sky  
Fireworks in the sky  
I'm so sick of this game  
It's hip, it's hot  
Life's too short, the whole thing's gotten  
Boring!  
The old man is snoring  
And I'm taming the tiger  
(You can't tame the tiger)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
Nice, kitty kitty  
(Boring!)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
(You can't tame the tiger)  
Oh, be nice, kitty kitty  
(Boring!)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
Nice, kitty kitty  
(Boring, boring!)  
Tiger, tiger burning bright  
(Fight to the light, fight to the light)  
In the forest of the night

Front rooms  
Back rooms  
Slide into tables  
Crowd into bathrooms  
Joke around  
Cheap talk  
Deep talk  
Talk, talk, talk around the clock  
Crawl home  
Lie down  
Teeth chatter  
Heart pounds  
I don't feel so good  
I don't feel so good  
Push a button to escape  
Preacher on the tube crying "Lord!"  
There's evil in this land  
  
"Rock and roll music!"  
"Cast down these dope-fiends  
And there noisy bands!"  
"Damn their souls!"  
  
Preacher preaching love like vengeance  
Preaching love like hate  
Calling for large donations  
Promising estates  
Rolling lawns and angel bands  
Behind the pearly gates  
You know, he will have his in this life  
But yours will have to wait  
He's immaculately tax free  
  
"Multiple hundreds of thousands of"  
Tax free  
"Hundreds and millions of dollars"  
Tax free  
"A hundred billion dollars!  
And who is paying the price?  
Who, who  
"Your children are"  
  
Pissed off  
Jacked up  
Scream into the mike  
Spit into the loving cup  
Strut like a rooster  
March like a man  
God's hired hands and the devil bands  
Packing the same grandstands  
Different clothes  
"Pot in their pockets!"  
Different hair  
"Sexually active"  
Raise a screaming guitar or a bible in the air  
Theater of anguish  
Theater of glory  
God's hired hands and the devil bands  
Oh come let us adore me!  
Lord, there's danger in this land  
You get witch-hunts and wars  
When church and state hold hands  
  
Fuck it!  
Tonight I'm going dancing  
With the drag queens and the punks  
Big beat deliver me  
From this sanctimonious skunk  
We're no flaming angels  
And he's not heaven sent  
How can he speak for the Prince of Peace  
When he's hawk-right militant  
And he's immaculately tax free  
  
"Our nation has lost its guts!"  
Save me  
"Our nation has lost its strength"  
Tax free  
"Our nation has whimpered and cried"  
Save me  
"And petted the Castros"  
Tax free  
"The Khomeinis' and the Kaddafis'"  
Save me  
"For so long"  
Tax free  
"That we don't know how to act like a man"  
Save me  
"I think that we should turn the United States Marines  
loose on that little island south of Florida and  
stop that problem!"  
"I am preachin' love, I am!"

You could have been more  
Than a name on the door  
On the thirty-third floor in the air  
More than a credit card  
Swimming pool in the backyard  
  
While you still have the time  
You could get away and find  
A better life, you know the grind Is so ungrateful  
Racing cars, whiskey bars  
No one cares who you really are  
You're the keeper of the cards  
Yes I know it gets hard  
Keeping the wheels turning  
And the wife she keeps the keys  
She is so pleased to be  
A part of the arrangement  
  
You could have been more  
Than a name on the door  
On the thirty-third floor in the air  
More than a consumer  
Lying in some roam trying to die  
More than a credit card  
Swimming pool in the backyard  
You could have been more than a name on the door  
You could have been more than a name on the door  
You could have been more  
You could have been more  
You could have been more

I met a young soldier  
He said his name was Killer Kyle  
He was shakin' all over  
Like a night-frightened child  
This is his story  
It's a tough one for me to sing  
Hard as the squawk and the flap  
And the beat of, the beat of black wings  
  
"They gave me a gun," he said  
"They gave me a mission  
For the power and the glory,  
Propaganda, piss on 'em  
There's a war zone inside me,  
I can feel things exploding,  
I can't even hear the fucking music playing  
For the beat of, the beat of black wings."  
  
He said, "I never had nothin',  
Nothin' I could believe in  
My girl killed our unborn child  
Without even grievin'!  
I put my hands on her belly  
To feel the kid kickin', damn!  
She'd been to some clinic  
Oh, the beat of black wings."  
  
"They want you, they need you,  
They train you to kill,  
To be a pin on some map,  
Some vicarious thrill,  
The old hate the young  
That's the whole heartless thing  
The old pick the wars  
We die in 'em  
To the beat of, the beat of black wings."  
  
There's a man drawing pictures  
On the sidewalk with chalk  
Just as fast as he draws 'em  
Rain come down and wash 'em off  
"Keep the drinks comin' girl  
'Til I can't feel anything  
I'm just a chalk mark in a rainstorm  
I'm just the beat of black wings."

And so once again  
My dear Johnny my dear friend  
And so once again you are fightin' us all  
And when I ask you why  
You raise your sticks and cry, and I fall  
Oh, my friend  
How did you come  
To trade the fiddle for the drum  
  
You say I have turned  
Like the enemies you've earned  
But I can remember  
All the good things you are  
And so I ask you please  
Can I help you find the peace and the star  
Oh, my friend  
What time is this  
To trade the handshake for the fist  
  
And so once again  
Oh, America my friend  
And so once again  
You are fighting us all  
And when we ask you why  
You raise your sticks and cry and we fall  
Oh, my friend  
How did you come  
To trade the fiddle for the drum  
  
You say we have turned  
Like the enemies you've earned  
But we can remember  
All the good things you are  
And so we ask you please  
Can we help you find the peace and the star  
Oh my friend  
We have all come  
To fear the beating of your drum

I want to paint a picture  
Botticelli style  
Instead of Venus on a clam  
I'd paint this flower child  
"You are the air my flowers breathe"  
He calls, and the ladies turn around  
On the first day of Spring  
I'm looking at the only joy around  
  
He's the only joy around  
The only joy I found  
The only joy in town  
  
The Spanish steps are crowded  
Bunch of bodies brooding there  
Dead pan side-walk vendors  
Hustling vacant stares  
Making all the more exceptional  
This fool in a flower crown  
On the first day of Spring  
I'm looking at the only joy in town  
  
He's the only joy around  
The only joy I found  
The only joy in town  
  
The Botticelli black boy  
With the fuchsias in his hair  
Is breathing in women like oxygen  
On the Spanish stairs  
In my youth I would have followed him  
All through this Terra-Cotta town  
On the first day of Spring  
We'd dance and sing  
And be the only joy around  
  
We'd be the only joy around  
The only joy in town  
He's the only joy I've found  
All day  
  
At night these streets are empty  
Where does everybody go  
Where are the brash and tender rooms  
In Roman candle glow  
Where are Fellini's circus'  
La Dolce Vita clowns  
On the first day of Spring  
I'm looking  
At the only joy in town  
  
He's the only joy around  
The only joy I found  
The only joy in town

The pirate anchored on a Wednesday  
And why he came to port I wonder  
To see a lady so my friends say  
She dances for the sailors  
In a smoky cabaret bar underground  
Down in a cellar in a harbor town  
I know he told her love was treasure  
And they would reap the fullest bounty  
He only comes to port for pleasure  
So when the winds of morning  
Blew the curtains in she woke and found he'd gone  
I saw his sails unfurling Thursday dawn  
The pirate he will sink you with a kiss  
He'll steal your heart and sail away  
  
Saturday early we met in the cove near the forest  
  
He'll leave you drowning in the flotsam Of a broken promise in the bay  
  
(Dancing we wakened the dawn and the birds into chorus)  
  
He came again to see her  
Yes I think they told me it was Saturday  
  
(Ask Penance Crane she was out in her garden she saw us)  
  
I was at sea then  
I didn't see them  
I don't believe what you are saying  
It isn't true I hardly knew him  
Is this some game that you are playing  
Go ask the dancer she's the one who saw him last  
The one who drew him here  
He hasn't come to me since spring last year  
There was a time when he would  
Bring me silks and sandalwood and Persian lace  
  
(Then came another "goodbye" and another "Please don't go")  
  
And he would hold me close  
And tell my sailing stories by the fireplace  
  
(All night I dance and all day I keep watch with my sorrow)  
  
I was at sea I tell you I was  
Nowhere near the mentioned murder place  
  
(Searching for sails that don't come  
And I guess but I don't know)  
  
Go ask the dancer  
She knows the answer  
  
I don't know  
  
She knows the answer  
  
I don't know  
  
She knows the answer  
  
I don't know

I picked the morning paper off the floor  
It was full of other people's little wars  
Wouldn't they like their peace  
Don't we get bored  
And we call for the three great stimulants  
Of the exhausted ones  
Artifice, brutality and innocence  
Artifice and innocence  
  
No tanks have ever rumbled through these streets  
and the drone of planes at night has never frightened me  
I keep the hours and the company that I please  
And we call for the three great stimulants  
Of the exhausted ones  
Artifice, brutality and innocence  
Artifice and innocence  
  
Oh and deep in the night  
Our appetites find us  
Release us and bind us  
Deep in the night  
While madmen sit up building bombs  
And making laws and bars  
They'd like to slam free choice behind us  
  
I saw a little lawyer on the tube  
He said, "It's so easy now, anyone can sue."  
"Let me show you how your petty aggravations can profit you!"  
Call for the three great stimulants  
Of the exhausted ones  
Artifice, brutality and innocence  
Artifice and innocence  
  
Oh and deep in the night  
Appetites find us  
Release us and blind us  
Deep in the night  
While madmen sit up building bombs  
And making laws and bars  
They're gonna slam free choice behind us  
  
Last night I dreamed I saw the planet flicker  
Great forests fell like buffalo  
Everything got sicker  
And to the bitter end  
Big business bickered  
And they call for the three great stimulants  
Of the exhausted ones  
Artifice, brutality and innocence  
Artifice and innocence  
  
Oh these times, these times  
Oh these changing times  
Change in the heart of all mankind  
Oh these troubled times

Of the darkness in men's minds  
What can you say  
That wasn't marked by history  
Or the T.V. news today  
He gets away with murder  
The blizzards come and go  
The stab and glare and buckshot  
Of the heavy heavy snow  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes  
  
His grandpa loved an empire  
His sister loved a thief  
And lindsey loved the ways of darkness  
Beyond belief  
Girls in chilly blouses  
The blizzards come and go  
The stab and glare and buckshot  
Of the heavy heavy snow  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes  
  
The cops don't seem to care  
For derelicts or ladies of the night  
They're weeds for yanking out of sight  
If you're smart or rich or lucky  
Maybe you'll beat the laws of man  
But the inner laws of spirit  
And the outer laws of nature  
No man can  
No, no man can  
  
There lives a wolf in Lindsey  
That raids and runs  
Through the hills of Hollywood  
And the downtown slums  
He gets away with murder  
The blizzards come and go  
The stab and glare and buckshot  
Of the heavy heavy snow  
It comes and goes  
It comes and goes

Look out the left the captain said  
The lights down there, that's where we'll land  
I saw a falling star burn up  
Above the Las Vegas sands  
It wasn't the one that you gave to me  
That night down south between the trailers  
Not the early one  
That you can wish upon,  
Not the northern one  
That guides in the sailors  
  
Oh star bright, star bright  
You've got the lovin' that I like, all right  
Turn this crazy bird around  
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight  
  
You got the touch so gentle and sweet  
But you've got that look so critical  
Now I can't talk to you baby  
I get so weak  
Sometimes I think love is just mythical  
Up there's a heaven  
Down there's a town  
Blackness everywhere and little lights shine  
Oh, blackness, blackness dragging me down  
Come on light the candle in this poor heart of mine  
  
Oh star bright, star bright  
You've got the lovin' that I like, all right  
Turn this crazy bird around  
I shouldn't hove got on this flight tonight  
  
I'm drinking sweet champagne  
Got the headphones up high  
Can't numb you out  
Can't drum you out of my mind  
They're playing "Goodbye baby, Baby Goodbye,  
Ooh, ooh, love is blind"  
Up go the flaps, down go the wheels  
I hope you got your heat turned on baby  
I hope they finally fixed your automobile  
I hope it's better when we meet again baby  
  
Star bright, star bright  
You got the lovin' that I like, all right  
Turn this crazy bird around  
I shouldn't have got on this flight tonight

Sparkle on the ocean  
Eagle at the top of a tree  
Those crazy crows always making a commotion  
This land is home to me.  
  
I was talking to my neighbor  
He said, "When I get to heaven, if it is not like this,  
I'll just hop a cloud and I'm coming right back down here  
Back to this heavenly bliss."  
  
You see those lovely hills  
They won't be there for long  
They're gonna tear 'em down  
And sell them to California  
Here come the toxic spills  
Miners poking all around  
When this place looks like a moonscape  
Don't say I didn't warn ya...  
  
Money, money, money...  
Money makes the trees come down  
It makes mountains into molehills  
Big money kicks the wide wide world around.  
  
Black bear in the orchard  
At night he's in my garbage cans  
He's getting so bold but no one wants to shoot him  
He's got a right to roam this land.  
  
I feel like Geronimo  
I used to be as trusting as Cochise  
But the white eyes lies  
He's out of whack with nature  
And look how far his weapons reach!  
  
Spirit of the water  
Give us all the courage and the grace  
To make genius of this tragedy unfolding  
The genius to save this place.

You want to make Van Goghs  
Raise 'em up like sheep  
Make 'em out of Eskimos  
And women if you please  
Make 'em nice and normal  
Make 'em nice and neat  
You see him with his shotgun there?  
Bloodied in the wheat?  
Oh what do you know about  
Living in Turbulent Indigo?  
  
Brash fields, crude crows  
In a scary sky  
In a golden frame  
Roped off  
Tourists guided by  
Tourists talking about the madhouse  
Talking about the ear  
The madman hangs in fancy homes  
They wouldn't let him near!  
He'd piss in their fireplace!  
He'd drag them through Turbulent Indigo  
  
"I'm a burning hearth," he said  
"People see the smoke  
But no one comes to warm themselves  
Sloughing off a coat  
And all my little landscapes  
All my yellow afternoons  
Stack up around this vacancy  
Like dirty cups and spoons  
No mercy Sweet Jesus!  
No mercy from Turbulent Indigo."

Tomorrow is Sunday  
Now there's only one day left to go  
Till you walk by  
Below my window  
The weekends drive me mad  
Holidays are oh too sad  
'Cause you don't go  
Below my window  
  
No one knows I'm here  
One day I just disappeared  
And I took these two grey rooms up here  
With a view  
When you walk by  
Below my window  
  
You look so youthful  
Time has been untruthful  
Heaven knows I loved you  
30 years ago  
Hot days your shirt's undone  
Rainy days you run  
Oh and then you fade so fast  
Below my window  
  
No one knows I'm here  
One day I just disappeared  
And I took these two grey rooms up here  
With a view  
Only when you walk by  
Below my window  
When you walk by  
  
Below my window  
Below my window  
Hey hey  
Below my window  
Below my window  
Below my window

Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the stars above I do!  
I swear on the streetlight on the corner  
Shoving back the shadows!  
One shadow cursing  
Another shadow laughing  
Underneath the streetlight  
I don't know where they're coming from  
I just see 'em passing  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the buildings above I do!  
I swear on a billion yellow and T.V. blue windows!  
Gayboys with their pants so tight  
Out in the neon light  
Underneath the street light  
A m- m- madman-madman  
Kicking over garbage cans  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the blinkin' planes above I do!  
I swear on the truck at the stoplight  
With his airbrakes moaning!  
All night the trucks roll  
Up to the tunnel-toll  
Underneath the streetlight  
They come rollin', rollin'  
Rollin' for a living  
Underneath the streetlight  
  
Yes I do, I love you!  
I swear on the disco sparkle dark I do!  
I swear on the be-bop boys  
Chasing the black bird  
Rock 'n' roll broadcast  
Movin' up now full blast  
Underneath the streetlight  
They come dancin', dancin'  
Really rock 'n rollin'  
Underneath the streetlight  
Yes I do, I love you  
I really love you  
Yes I do, yes I do  
I love you!
