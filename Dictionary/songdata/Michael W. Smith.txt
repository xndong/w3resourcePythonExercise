Can you hear, there's a new song  
Breaking out from the children of freedom  
Every race and every nation  
Sing it out sing a new Hallelujah  
  
Let us sing love to the nations  
Bringing hope of the grace that has freed us  
Make Him known and make Him famous  
Sing it out sing to the new Hallelujah  
  
[Chorus]  
Arise  
Let the church Arise  
Let love reach to the other side  
Alive come alive  
Let the song Arise  
  
Africa sings a new song  
Reaching out with the new Hallelujah  
Every son and every daughter  
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Arise  
Let the song Arise  
Let love reach to the other side  
Alive come alive  
Let the song Arise  
  
Whoa whoa yeah [Repeat: x2]  
Let the song arise [Repeat: x2]  
Let the song arise yeah [Repeat: x2]  
  
Let the world sing a new Hallelujah  
From Africa to Australia  
From Brazil to China  
From New York down to Houston!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everyone sing a new Hallelujah [Repeat: x2]

Above all powers  
Above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms  
Above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Above all powers  
Above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms  
Above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what you're worth  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Crucified  
Laid behind the stone  
You lived to die  
Rejected and alone  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all  
  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall  
And thought of me  
Above all

[Verse 1]  
When the music fades  
And all is stripped away  
And I simply come  
Longing just to bring  
Something that's of worth  
That will bless your heart  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'll bring you more than a song  
For a song in itself  
Is not what you have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm coming back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about you, it's all about you Jesus  
I'm sorry Lord, for the thing I've made it  
When it's all about you, it's all about you Jesus  
  
[Verse 2]  
King of endless worth  
No one could express  
How much you deserve  
Though I'm weak and poor  
All I have is yours  
Every single breath  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I'll bring you more than a song  
For a song in itself  
Is not what you have required  
You search much deeper within  
Through the way things appear  
You're looking into my heart  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm coming back to the heart of worship  
And it's all about you, it's all about you Jesus  
I'm sorry Lord, for the thing I've made it  
When it's all about you, it's all about you Jesus

All I have in this world  
Is fire from above  
All I have in this world  
Is you  
And all the journeys I have walked  
I know you've walked them too  
All I want is to be faithful  
All I want is you  
  
All I have is a love  
That set my world on fire  
Let it fall, let it burn in me  
And oh to be a friend of God is all that I desire  
All I want is to be faithful  
All I want is you  
  
All I want is you  
All I want is you  
All I want is you  
Is you  
  
All I have in this world  
Is fire from above  
All I have in this world  
Is you  
And all the journeys I have walked  
I know you've walked them too  
All I want is to be faithful  
All I want is you  
  
All I want is you  
All I want is you  
Da, oh oh oh  
All I want is you  
Is you

Never gave you nothin'  
People couldn't explain away  
Never gave you nothin'  
Without something to gain  
Never could slow down enough  
To study a face, but now  
I wanna know your name  
  
[Chorus]  
Hold my feet to the fire  
'Til I'm breaking a sweat  
'Til I never forget  
Your calling  
Keep me on the line  
Give me the nerve  
Here it's all in the serve  
  
Locked in the diamond lane  
I kept driving past it  
Better to be safe than learn  
What you're about  
Give me another chance  
To go where you're going now  
I'm here to walk it out  
I'm here to walk it out  
I'm here to walk it out  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
It's all in the serve  
It's all in the serve  
Here it's all in the serve

All is well all is well  
Angels and men rejoice  
For tonight darkness fell  
Into the dawn of love's light  
Sing A-le  
Sing Alleluia  
All is well all is well  
Let there be peace on earth  
Christ is come go and tell  
That He is in the manger  
Sing A-le  
Sing Alleluia  
  
All is well all is well  
Lift up your voices and sing  
Born is now Emmanuel  
Born is our Lord and Savior  
Sing Alleluia  
Sing Alleluia  
All is well

This Christmas season I wish you joy  
The wonder in every girl and boy  
I wish you gladness, the one [Incomprehensible]  
Have good friends and family gathered near  
May children's laughter in falling snow  
Rekindle those sweet scenes from long ago  
May every carol, each candle bright  
Remind you why angels sang that night  
If trouble finds you, this is my prayer  
May peace come into your hearts and make you strong  
And I wish you luck, the kind to last all year long  

[Verse 1]  
It's over the line - a shadow of doubt  
From outside looking at the "in crowd"  
Tempting voices are calling you  
They look mighty fine - a sight to behold  
But all that glitters is not gold  
Still those voices are calling you  
  
[Chorus]  
All your missing is a heartache  
A disillusion for a keepsake  
A life of living with your own mistake  
All you're missing in a heartache  
  
[Verse 2]  
The water is high - you're out on a limb  
Well, if you take the fall then it's "sink or swim"  
Clouds of reason will follow you  
You're kissing the dark  
You're courting your pride  
You wonder is it greater on the other side  
But they have nothing to offer you  
  
[Chorus]

Amazing grace  
How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but now I'm found  
Was blind, but now I see  
  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
[Chorus]  
My chains are gone  
I've been set free  
My God, my Savior has ransomed me  
And like a flood His mercy rains  
Unending love, Amazing grace  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The earth shall soon dissolve like snow  
The sun forbear to shine  
But God, Who called me here below  
Will be forever mine  
Will be forever mine  
You are forever mine

My steps were wandering  
My lips were hungry  
My heart was thundering  
For something more than all those things  
  
My words were crying out  
My faith was darkened out  
My life lost without  
This one amazing love  
  
Washing over me like rain  
Conquering the fear and pain  
My broken path was not in vain  
Glory Hallelujah, glory Hallelujah  
Glory Hallelujah, glory Hallelujah  
  
Washing over me like rain  
Taking all the fear and pain  
My broken path was not in vain  
Glory Hallelujah, glory Hallelujah  
  
I lift my blinded eyes  
Towards the souls denied  
And saw the One who died  
For one amazing love  
Hallelujah  
  
One amazing love  
Just one amazing love  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Just one amazing love  
Just one amazing love

Holy words long preserved  
For our walk in this world,  
They resound with God's own heart  
Oh, let the Ancient words impart.  
  
Words of Life, words of Hope  
Give us strength, help me cope  
In this world, where e'er we roam  
Ancient words will guide us Home.  
  
[Chorus]  
Ancient words ever true  
Changing me, and changing you.  
We have come with open hearts  
Oh let the ancient words impart.  
  
Holy words of our Faith  
Handed down to this age.  
Came to us through sacrifice  
Oh heed the faithful words of Christ.  
  
Holy words long preserved  
For our walk in this world.  
They resound with God's own heart  
Oh let the ancient words impart.  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x4]  
  
We have come with open hearts  
Oh let the ancient words impart.

Maybe there's a light in my soul  
Maybe it flickers like a neon sign  
Outside an abandoned hotel  
  
Maybe there are things you just can't know  
But can you say there are no mysteries  
In that house you choose to dwell?  
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware  
  
Maybe there's a place where we will fly  
But some, say God is dead like Nietzsche said  
And faith has made me a fool  
  
But maybe there is more than meets the eye  
Who's that stranger, there, beside you?  
Don't be smug and don't be cruel  
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware  
  
Battles of the heart and of the mind  
We stay caught in mental purgatory  
'Til our existence can be defined  
  
Meanwhile on the shores of parallel  
There may be a holy conference held somewhere  
Discussing all mankind  
Maybe we are entertaining angels unaware  
  
I say maybe we are entertaining angels unaware  
Angels unaware  
  
Longing, reaching  
Searching, knowing  
Loving, caring  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
Lead you to the Promised Land  
And trust Him with your heart  
He'll lead you home  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
Lead you to the Promised Land  
And trust Him with your heart  
He'll lead you home  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
Lead you to the Promised Land  
Trust Him with your heart  
He'll lead you home  
  
Let me take you by the hand  
Lead you to the Promised Land  
And trust Him with your heart  
He'll lead you home  
  
Soaring, somewhere  
Longing, reaching  
Searching, knowing  
Loving, caring  
  
Soaring, somewhere

In the space of the beginning  
Was the living Word of Light  
When this Word was clearly spoken  
All that came to be was right  
All creation had a language  
Words to say what must be said  
All day long the heavens whispered  
Signing words in scarlet red  
  
Some failed to understand it  
So God spoke His final Word  
On a silent night in Judah's  
Hills a baby's cry was heard  
  
"Glory!" sang the angel chorus  
"Glory!" echoed back the night  
Love has come to walk among us  
Christ the Lord is born this night  
  
All creation sing His praises  
Earth and heaven praise His name  
All who live come join the chorus  
Find the words His love proclaim  
  
Find the words His love proclaim

Our Father, which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Our Father, which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Thy Kingdom come  
Thy Will be done  
On Earth as it is in Heaven  
  
Our Father, which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Our Father, which art in Heaven  
Our Father  
Hallowed be thy name  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Thy Kingdom come  
Thy Will be done  
On Earth as it is in Heaven  
  
Give us this day  
Our daily bread  
And forgive us our debts  
As we forgive our debtors  
  
Our Father, which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
Our Father, which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
  
And lead us not into temptation  
But deliver us, deliver us from evil  
  
For Thine is the Kingdom, and all the power  
And the glory  
Forever Amen  
  
Our Father, which art in Heaven  
Hallowed be thy name  
Thy Kingdom come  
Thy Will be done  
On Earth as it is in Heaven

Away in a manger, no crib for a bed  
The little Lord Jesus  
Laid down his sweet head  
The stars in the sky  
Look down where he lay  
The little Lord Jesus asleep on the hay  
  
The cattle are lowing  
Poor baby awakes  
The little Lord Jesus  
No crying he makes  
I love the Lord Jesus  
Look down from the sky  
And stay by my craddle  
Till morning is nigh  
  
Be near me Lord Jesus  
I ask thee to stay  
Close by me forever  
And love me I pray  
Bless all the dear children  
From thy tender care  
And take us to heaven  
To live with thee there.

When He rolls up His sleeves  
He ain't just putting on the ritz  
There's thunder in His footsteps  
And lightning in His fists  
The Lord wasn't joking  
When He kicked 'em out of Eden  
It wasn't for no reason  
That He shed His blood  
His return is very close  
And so you better be believing that  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
And when the sky was starless  
In the void of the night  
(God is an awesome God)  
He spoke into the darkness  
And created the light  
(God is an awesome God)  
Judgement and wrath He poured out on Sodom  
Mercy and grace He gave us at the cross  
I hope that we have not  
Too quickly forgotten that  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God (Our God is an awesome God)  
He reigns from heaven above  
With wisdom, power, and love  
Our God is an awesome God  
Our God is an awesome God (Our God is an awesome God)  
He reigns from heaven above (He reigns)  
With wisdom, power, and love (With wisdom and power)  
God is an awesome God  
  
Our God is an awesome God  
Our God is an awesome God

Sin and its ways grow old  
All of my heart turns to stone  
And I'm left with no strength to arise  
How You need to be lifted high  
Sin and its ways lead to pain  
Left here with hurt and with shame  
So no longer will I leave Your side  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God  
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
And even now that I'm inside Your house  
Help me not to grow prideful again  
Don't let me forsake sacrifice  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
And if I'm blessed with the riches of kings  
How could I ever feel that it was me?  
For You brought me from darkness to light  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high, You'll be lifted high  
You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God  
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I  
And Jesus, You'll be lifted high  
Oh Jesus, You'll be lifted high, oh, You'll be lifted high  
Oh, You'll be lifted high in my life, oh God  
And I fall to my knees, so it's You that they see not I  
Jesus, You'll be lifted high, yeah, yeah  

Wasn't it long ago  
Wasn't it on a New England coast  
Wasn't it the standard - people praying to  
The Son and the Father and the Holy Ghost  
One nation over God  
Is that what we've now become?  
The founding fathers left a noble legacy  
To their sons and daughters  
To their sons and daughters  
Look at what we've done  
Look at what we've done  
  
Chorus:  
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown  
As we learn to bite the hand  
That tries to feed us  
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown  
If we say that we are free  
Who will believe us  
If we breakdown, breakdown, breakdown  
Breakdown, break  
  
See the powder on the glass  
See the pillow on the street  
See the charter of a modern love  
With no obligations...or promises to meet  
  
Hear the fear of disease  
Hear the baby never born  
Hear a people crying out  
"Somebody save us - oh, please somebody save us  
From what we're headed for - from what we're headed for"  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown  
As we learn to bite the hand  
That tries to feed us  
Breakdown, breakdown, breakdown  
  
[Chorus]

When you're weary feeling small  
When tears are in your eyes I'll dry them all all  
I'm on your side oh when times get rough  
And friends just can't be found  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
When you're down and out  
When you're on the street  
When evening falls so hard  
I will comfort you ooh  
I'll take your part oh when darkness comes  
And pain is all around  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will lay me down  
  
Sail on silver girl  
Sail on by  
Your time has come to shine  
All your dreams are on their way  
See how they shine  
Oh if you need a friend  
I'm sailing right behind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Like a bridge over troubled water  
I will ease your mind  
Yeah yeah

[Chorus:]  
Calling heaven  
Seeking mercy  
Tell me there's a place for these  
What of the children who have never felt a love  
Tender as the morning  
Nursing the bruises  
And the scars that never seem to go away  
  
What of the babies who have never left the womb  
Breathing in the lifeline  
Angels in waiting  
Gone before they could be given wings to fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What of the noble who are searching for the truth  
With truest of intentions  
And yet they're jaded by  
Hypocrisies behind cathedral walls  
  
What of the humble and the meek that knew despair  
And never got their moment  
But sacrificed a life of comfort  
So that others knew no pain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What of the ones who call you Lord  
But play the field  
with faithless indecision  
Forgive us father for we truly  
Do not know what we have done  
  
[Chorus]

Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour  
Born this day, angels say  
In a lowly manger  
He came down to the earth  
Bringing us new birth  
Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour  
  
Tidings bring! Hail the King!  
Shepherds did adore Him  
From afar, by the star  
Wise men sought and found Him  
Son of God, Son of Man  
All in all I see  
Carols raise His name praise  
He shall reign eternally  
Carols sing to the King  
Jesus Christ our Saviour

Child in the manger, Infant of Mary  
Outcast and stranger, Lord of all

Genlty and lowly, lived below  
Now as our glorios Mighty Redeemer  
See Him victorios

Christmas angels sing all around us  
Spread good tidings over the earth  
Telling of a child in a manger who is born  
He is the King of kings  
King of glory, hope for our nations  
Sent to earth to save and redeem  
Prince of peace, behold and adore  
The Son of God has come to set us free

Snow covered rooftops  
Lights on the trees  
The sound of singing  
I hear down every street  
  
Families have gathered  
From miles away  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
  
You see that old tree  
Down Cotton Lane  
Those lights keep shining  
It's always the same  
  
We hear the church bells  
Ring out to say  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
  
Swing the lights and hang the stockings  
Decorate with green and red  
Made the cookies for old Santa  
Made a runway for his sled  
  
Singing carols on a sleigh ride  
Gather 'round the manger scene  
Open presents, read the letter  
And together we will sing  
  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
Joy to the world  
For every nation  
For every boy and girl  
  
Let's light a candle  
For peace we pray  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
It's Christmas day  
It's Christmas day  
  
Let's light a candle  
For peace we pray  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day  
Oh, Merry Christmas  
It's Christmas day

Frosted window panes  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
  
Santa's on his way  
He's filled his sleigh with things  
Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year  
When the world falls in love  
Every song you hear seems to say  
  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Year's dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In three quarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too!  
  
Frosted window panes  
(See them gleaming)  
Candles gleaming inside  
Painted candy canes on the tree  
Just look and you'll see  
  
Santa's on his way  
(That's why sleigh bells are ringing)  
He's filled his sleigh  
(And that's why we're all singing)  
With things  
Things for you and for me  
  
It's that time of year  
(Time for falling)  
When the world falls in love  
(So in love)  
Every song you hear seems to say  
  
Merry Christmas  
May your New Year's dreams come true  
And this song of mine  
In three quarter time  
Wishes you and yours  
The same thing too!

[Chorus]  
Ring Christmas bells  
Ring them loud with the message bringing  
Peace on the earth  
Tidings of good cheer  
Come carolers  
Come and join with the angels singing  
Joy to the world  
Christmastime is here again  
  
Children gather around and listen  
You'll hear the sound  
Of angels filling the sky  
Telling everyone  
Christmas time is here  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Loved ones close to our hearts  
and strangers in lands afar  
Together share in the joy

Been here for days, I'm amazed (at) this teacher, carpenter, preacher  
Lost in the crowd, I hear him now, He's praying and He's saying, "God feed
them all"  
Five-thousand men, all of His friends are worried find bread and hurry  
Five loaves and fish, what can He wish, He's praying still He's saying, "God
feed them all"  
  
[Chorus]  
Could He be the Messiah?  
Miracle man, part of the plan  
Could He be the Messiah?  
Life in His hand,  
I understand He could be  
  
Meet for our needs fully He feeds our hunger older and younger  
Twelve baskets more, can we ignore, He shows us that He knows us, is He the
Christ?  
God in His eyes, I realize His power, need of the hour  
Jesus is His name, they say He came to feed us and to receive us, is He the
Christ?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It is He the Messiah!  
Miracle man, part of the plan  
It is He the Messiah!  
Life in His hand  
I understand it is He  
  
[Chorus]

In the darkness and in the flood  
You're there with me, You're there with  
And in the desert and in the sun  
You're holdin' me, You're holdin' me, yeah  
  
You cover me with Your love  
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love  
You cover me with, You cover me with Your love

I remember when you took a stand  
With the pearl of wisdom in your hand  
And a soul of desire  
You hold your own up against the world  
A lion's heart in a little girl  
So unafraid of the fire  
  
But those days don't last  
Sweet dreams die fast  
A stumble when you walk on the wire  
When all your friends  
Start giving in  
The flames are burning higher and higher  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up, Andrea  
Got the whole world at your feet  
Just keep on holding on  
This is where you need to be  
  
All the days that you've been spending  
Spinning while your heart's descending  
Like a stone in the ocean  
Sometimes when you think the world is ending  
It's really just a new beginning  
The other side of emotion  
  
But I've seen your eyes  
No compromise  
When you set your mind on the matter  
Be strong through the tears  
And your sight will clear  
You're gonna get what you're after  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Don't be surprised when the road divides  
Just take the one less traveled by  
  
[Chorus]

I will run and not be weak  
Hope has come  
Renewed my strength  
I have found what I did seek  
And I'm ready to fly  
  
All forgiven, all forgot  
Heaven waits beyond the plot  
Swing low, sweet chariot  
Yes, I'm ready to fly  
  
Father come to save my soul  
Father come to  
Make me whole  
There was a price  
He paid the toll  
Gave me freedom to fly  
  
And every battle, every war  
You will be my shield and my sword  
You know I'm waiting on You Lord  
You give me freedom to fly  
  
Watch the eagles fly  
Gonna set your feet on high  
On the wind, like a dove  
Go on and fly  
In the shadow of love  
  
Fly, gonna fly  
  
Yes, I'm watching you fly  
He set your feet on high  
On the wind, like a dove  
Go on and fly  
In the shadow of love

Caught, in an endless time  
Waiting for a sign  
To show you where to go  
Lost, in a silent stare  
Looking anywhere  
For answers you don't know  
  
[Chorus:]  
On the wire  
Balancing your dreams  
Hoping ends will meet their means  
You feel alone  
Uninspired  
Well does it help you to  
Know that I believe in you  
You're an angel waiting for wings...Emily  
  
You, going through this stage  
It's a restless age  
Young and insecure  
Sill, there are doubts to fade  
Moments to be made  
And one of them is yours  
  
[Chorus]  
  
On the wire  
Balancing your dreams  
Hoping ends will meet their means  
But you feel alone  
Uninspired  
Oh does it help you to  
Know that I believe in you  
You're an angel waiting for wings  
Oh, you're an angel waiting for wings...Emily

On the day  
You were saved  
Heaven and hell marked you down  
Angels praise  
Devils raged  
Life became a battleground  
So when hell starts to move  
And the enemy marches on you  
Hang on, it's a fight  
You've been marked by the army of night  
You're a target  
  
When your heart  
Loved the dark  
Hell could just leave you alone  
With your life  
Filled with light  
You have become quite a foe  
  
So when hell starts to move  
And the enemy marches on you  
Hang on, it's a fight  
It's a battle of darkness and light  
  
[Chorus:]  
When things get bad and you can't stand to look  
It's time to read to the end of the book  
Don't put it down 'til you get to the end  
When Jesus come and His Kingdom begins  
'Til He comes  
God the Son  
Teaches us to use the sword  
And every fight  
Has a light  
When you know we win the war  
  
So when hell starts to move  
And the enemy marches on you  
Hang on, it's a fight  
You're a part of the army of light  
  
[Chorus]

It's like staring at the sky above  
When I look in your eyes  
Now where in the world did you come from?  
You're so beautiful and I know  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
Every time I turn around you're there  
I get a feeling that won't go away  
Nothing else in this whole world compares  
You're surrounding me and I know  
That I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
And in the righteous crowd  
Your face is all I see  
I hope you know by now  
That I just can't escape, yeah  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love  
Oh, I can't escape your love  
Escape your love, escape your love, oh yeah, yeah  

The longing in my heart has stirred a faded memory  
Of my young heart beating fast behind the willow tree  
I was counting out loud, and I only peeked a time or two  
And the only purpose in my life was finding you  
Singing, "Ollie, ollie, everybody free!"  
Now was I chasing you or were you chasing me?  
  
We all grow up and put away our childhood games  
But deep inside I wonder if we really change  
'Cause I'm still seeking, though I've learned to hide so well  
And I can still remember how it felt  
Singing, "Ollie, ollie, everybody free!"  
Will I ever find someone pursuing me?  
  
And then you caught me by surprise  
I found my tears are in your eyes  
I hear my heart inside of you  
At last I've found somebody who  
Can free my soul  
And love me too  
  
I can't believe we hide so long and run so well  
When all the while we're aching to be caught and held  
But it's only in surrender that our freedom comes  
And so I run abandoned to your waiting arms  
Singing "Ollie, ollie, everybody free!"  
I belong to you and you belong to me!  
  
Singin' "Ollie, ollie, everybody free

Fly to the moon  
Well, you could do it if you wanted to  
Try flying high  
The only limit is the endless sky  
So, go on and fly to the moon  
  
Live in the sun  
You know your living has just begun  
So much ahead  
Don't let the night leave you for dead  
So, come on, live in the sun  
  
Fly to the moon  
And when you find your wings I will celebrate with you  
Watch you as you soar  
Take the wishes that are yours  
And let them fly you to the moon  
  
Dream on a star  
You can let it take you near or far  
Feet on the ground  
Don't let anybody hold you down  
So, go on and dream on a star  
  
Fly to the moon  
And when you find your wings  
I will celebrate with you  
Watch you as you soar  
Take the wishes that are yours  
I know you can fly to the moon  
You can do all things  
I will celebrate with you  
It's hard to let you go  
Still, you have to go,  
I know  
  
So go on, fly to the moon  
And as you spread your wings  
I will celebrate with you  
Hope we taught you good  
Hope you know that if I could  
I would fly away with you  
  
Gotta take it all the way  
When you follow dreams  
Follow far  
Flying high and away  
You're flying all the way  
To the moon

Sittin' in the rain  
Water on your brain  
Got a hole in your boat  
Trying to stay afloat  
Has got you down  
I've got a wind in my sail  
Rubber boots and a pail  
I'll throw you a line  
Rest assured that I  
Won't ever let you drown  
  
[Chorus]  
Cause when you're up against the wall  
You know I'll be here for you, for you  
When you rise and when you fall  
I'll always be here for you, for you  
  
When the plans you make  
Fall through and take you  
For a loop  
Or some bird has flown the coop  
And left you stranded  
Just lean on me  
And together you see  
We'll carry the load  
Even if we don't  
Quite understand it  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Chorus x2

Packing up the dreams God planted  
In the fertile soil of you  
Can't believe the hopes he's granted  
Means a chapter in your life is through  
But we'll keep you close as always  
It won't even seem you've gone  
Cause our hearts in big and small ways  
Will keep the love that keeps us strong  
  
And friends are friends forever  
If the Lord's the Lord of them  
And a friend will not say "Never"  
Cause the welcome will not end  
Though it's hard to let you go  
In the Father's hands we know  
That a lifetime's not too long  
To live as friends  
  
With the faith and love God's given  
Springing from the hope we know  
We will pray the joy you'll live in  
Is the strength that now you show  
But we'll keep you close as always  
It won't even seem you've gone  
Cause our hearts in big and small ways  
Will keep the love that keeps us strong

Michael W. Smith  
  
You must have felt alone  
Reaching through your doubt  
But I never meant to close you out  
While I was building dreams  
You were building fears  
And I was the cause of all those tears  
But can I start over and break new ground?  
I know I've let you down (oh babe...)  
  
Do you feel the weight of the world  
Heavy on your shoulders  
Well, let my love take you down another road  
And lighten up the load  
From here on  
  
Many were the times I failed to follow through  
Of pieces of heaven I promised you  
It wasn't paradise, it wasn't even close  
And I hurt the one I love the most  
And sorry could never be good enough  
But I will make it up to you...  
  
I know you feel the weight of the world  
Heavy on your shoulders  
Let my love take you down another road  
And lighten up the load  
From here on

She asked him for forever  
And a promise that would last  
He said, "Babe you know I love you  
But I can't commit to that"  
She said, "Love isn't love  
'Till you give it away"  
  
A father lived in silence  
Saw his son become a man  
There was a distance felt between them  
Cause he could not understand  
That love isn't love  
'Till you give it away  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
As we live  
Moving side by side  
May we learn to give  
Learn to sacrifice  
  
We can entertain compassion  
For a world in need of care  
But the road of good intentions  
Doesn't lead to anywhere  
Cause love isn't love  
'Till you give it away  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love is like a river  
Flowing down from the giver of life  
We drink from the water  
And our thirst is no longer denied  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was a man who walked on water  
He came to set the people free  
He was the ultimate example  
Of what love can truly be  
Cause his love was his life  
And he gave it away  
You gotta give it away  
  
[Chorus]

Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the pains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echo back their joyous strains  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo  
  
Come to Bethlehem and see  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Him whose birth the angels sing  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn King  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth  
With us sing our Savior's birth  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo  
  
Alleluia

Let us praise the One who chose us  
Let us thank the One who knows us  
Set apart, blameless in His sight  
Through the Son, we have faith, we have life  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
May the God of our Lord, the Almighty Father  
Give you wisdom and peace, His comforting spirit  
That you may know His hope  
You may know His riches  
And you may know His mighty strength  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
Grace and peace to you through Jesus  
Our deliverer receives us  
Our hearts created for His word  
Our salvation was spoken and we heard  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
May the God of our Lord, the Almighty Father  
Give you wisdom and peace, His comforting spirit  
That you may know His hope  
But you may know His riches  
You may know His mighty strength  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
To the praise of His glorious grace  
Amen  
Amen  
Amen  
Amen  

I'm blazing a trail that leads to vice  
So easily enticed  
By darker means  
When out of the wilderness of choice  
I hear that one still voice  
Call to me  
  
[Chorus]  
Go west young man  
Go west young man  
When the evil go east  
Go west young man  
Go west young man  
Find a heart that's golden  
  
Why must I wander like a cloud  
Following the crowd  
Well I don't know  
But I'm asking for the will to fight  
To wear the crown of life  
And you say go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The mind is weak the heart is frail  
When it goes beyond the pale  
So unwise  
  
[Chorus]

Actions have been justified  
All is compromised  
Looking for approval there  
In someone else's eyes, oh  
Dodging all you really are  
Becomes your greatest task  
Acting out your lonely part  
You hide behind your mask  
  
[Bridge]  
Never true to yourself  
Knowing well this is not like you  
Fooling yourself  
You're just living a lie  
  
[Chorus]  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
Goin' goin'  
Goin' through the motions  
  
Victim of the circumstance  
Prisoner of the shame  
But it's the double standard life  
That keeps you in the game  
Taken by your own disguise  
But when it's wearing thin  
You'll do anything it takes  
To impress your friends  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

I was lost when ya found me here  
You pulled me close and held me near  
And I'm a fool but still you love  
I'll be your fool for the king of love  
  
He gave me wings so I could fly  
And gave me a song to color the sky  
And all I have is all from you  
And all I want is all of you  
  
It's grace, grace  
I'm nothing without you  
Grace, your grace  
Shines on me  
  
And there've been days when I've walked away  
Too much to carry  
Nothing left to say  
Forgive me Lord when I'm weak and lost  
You traded heaven for a wooden cross  
  
And all these years you've carried me  
You've been my eyes when I could not see  
And beauty grows in the driving rain  
Your ode of gladness in the times of pain  
  
It's grace, your grace  
I'm nothing without you  
Grace, your grace  
Your grace, your grace  
I'm nothing without you  
Grace, your grace  
Shines on me oh yeah  
Shines on me  
Shines on me  
I'm everything with you  
Shines on me  
Shines on me  
It's your grace  
Shines on me  
Your grace  
  
Your grace it shines on me  
Your grace  
Your grace  
Shines on me  
Shines on me  
Your grace it shines on me  
Your grace  
It shines on me

Summer rains keep coming down  
It's about to swallow up this town  
You get the feeling that there's trouble ahead  
Folks say they've never seen  
The river acting quite this mean  
No one can stop it when it needs to be fed  
  
Look at the river  
The powerful river  
Greater Than We Understand  
Awesome in anger  
Crazy with hunger  
Dragging us under  
  
[Chorus]  
But you have the power  
The power to heal us  
Greater than we understand  
Righteous in anger  
Awesome with wonder  
If we reach out for your hand  
Yeah  
  
To many years since the lava flow  
This old mountain's about to blow  
Covering anything that gets in it's way  
Not a lot that you can say or do  
When the mountain wants to roll over you  
But gather up the ones you love and start to pray  
  
Look at the mountain  
The powerful mountain  
Greater than we understand  
Awesome in anger  
Crazy with hunger  
Dragging us under  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Yeah x3  
  
But you have the power  
The power to heal us  
Greater than we understand  
Righteous in anger  
Awesome with wonder  
Greater than we understand  
Yeah  
  
As far as you or I can see  
Hard times there will always be  
Thank God for answers to the trouble ahead

Providence, Providence  
See it laying down the cornerstone  
The Hand of Providence, it's evident  
For we could never make it on our own  
Apportioning the power  
Weighing all that it entails  
Giving us the fulcrum  
And a balance to the scales  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, the Hand of Providence  
Is guiding us through choices that we make  
Oh, the Hand of Providence  
Is reaching out to help us on our way  
  
Providence, ever since  
Any thesis ever entered man  
The Hand of Providence  
Has been our best defense  
Tho' his ways are sometimes hard to understand  
From the dying of a heartbeat  
To another soul reborn  
From in between and circling  
Our thoughts of love and war  
  
[Chorus]

Let the tempest and the flood  
Shake your soul and spill your blood  
Like an old song  
Keep hold'n on  
Let the people laugh at you  
Call you names and say you're through  
Never let go  
Keep hangin' on  
  
Hang on, hang on  
Can you hear me,  
I'm gonna say it again  
Hang on, hang on  
Never giving up, no, never giving in  
  
Hang on every hopeful word  
Even when it seems absurd  
Keep holdin' on  
If you triumph when you fail  
Keep your head when you prevail  
Be a hero  
Keep hangin' around  
  
Hang on, hang on  
Are you listening,  
Let me say it again  
Hang on, hang on  
Never giving up, no,  
Never giving in

Healing rain is coming down  
It's coming nearer to this old town.  
Rich and poor, weak and strong  
It's bringing mercy, it won't be long.  
Healing rain is coming down  
It's coming closer to the lost and found.  
Tears of joy and tears of shame  
Are washed forever in Jesus' name.  
  
[Chorus]  
Healing rain, it comes with fire  
So let it fall and take us higher.  
Healing rain, I'm not afraid  
To be washed in Heaven's rain.  
  
Lift your heads, let us return  
To the mercy seat where time began.  
And in your eyes I see the pain.  
Come soak this dry heart with healing rain.  
And only you, the son of man  
Can take a leper and let him stand.  
So lift your hands, they can be held  
By someone greater, the Great I Am.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Healing rain is falling down,  
Healing rain is falling down,  
I'm not afraid.  
I'm not afraid.

Where's the Navigator of your destiny?  
Where is the Dealer of this hand?  
Who can explain life and its brevity  
Cause there is nothing here that I can understand  
  
You and I have barely met  
And I just don't want to let go of you yet  
  
[Chorus]  
Noah, hello, goodbye  
I will see you on the other side  
Noah, sweet child of mine  
I will see you on the other side  
  
And so I hold your tiny hand in mine  
For the hardest thing I've ever had to face  
Heaven calls for you before it calls for me  
When you get there, save me a place  
  
A place where I can share your smile  
And I can hold you for more than just a while  
  
[Chorus]

It can be wise  
Or it can be a paradox  
To seek solace in your solitude  
And when it feels  
Like you're living in a box  
You need someone who believes in you  
A promise true when tried  
I'll be right here by your side  
So whenever your need be  
Know that you can lean on me  
  
Chorus:  
I'll help you find your way  
I'll help you find your way  
When you're lost in all the madness  
When you're blinded by your doubt  
When you need someone to be there for you  
I'll help you find your way  
  
Don't keep your thoughts  
Locked behind your cellar door  
All shrouded in a mystery  
Just let them out  
That's what friends are for  
To give without giving the "third degree"  
No need to be ashamed  
I've been through' it just the same  
So when your path misleads  
Know that you can call on me  
  
[Chorus]

There's a place where I can go  
Where the angels hear me pray  
"I want to change  
Yes I need Your touch"  
I'm waiting here for You  
  
And I fall, at Your feet  
I'll give it all, until the day we meet  
Here I am  
Ready to give up my life for the One  
Ready to pour out my heart for the Son  
Here I am  
  
Here I come to Your threshing floor  
Where the angels fear to tread  
I'm waiting here for the King of love  
And to hold the hands that bled  
  
And I fall, at Your feet  
I'll give it all, until the day we meet  
  
[Repeat x 2]  
Here I am  
Ready to give up my life for the One  
Ready to pour out my heart for the Son

Light of the World  
You stepped down into darkness  
Open my eyes  
Let me see  
Beauty that made  
This heart adore You  
Hope of a life  
Spent with You  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here I am to worship  
Here I am to bow down  
Here I am to say that You're my God  
You're altogether lovely  
Altogether worthy  
Altogether wonderful to me  
  
King of all days  
Oh, so highly exalted  
Glorious in Heaven above  
Humbly You came  
To the earth You created  
All for love's sake became poor  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll never know how much it cost  
To see my sin upon that cross  
  
[Chorus X2]

Hey you  
Things to do  
Live the life for faith and family  
It's tough  
With all that stuff  
Filling your head  
We know  
The undertow  
Could get us so we don't remember, but  
Lest we ever  
Lest we ever forget  
  
Hey you, it's me  
True lovers are we  
Children under the sun  
Two spirits in the name of One  
  
Hey me  
Got to be  
Places to go and people there to see  
No space  
For back to base  
And no time at all  
We talk  
Walk the walk  
Run the race  
And climb the ladder, but  
If we ever  
If we ever should fall  
  
Sometimes the smoke clears  
And I see things how they are  
I see how we have come so far

Hallelujah, Hallelujah, For our Lord God Almighty Reigns  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, For our Lord God Almighty Reigns  
Hallelujah, Holy, Holy  
Are you Lord God Almighty  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Worthy is the Lamb  
You are Holy, Holy,  
Are you Lord God Almighty  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Amen  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, For our Lord God Almighty Reigns  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, For our Lord God Almighty Reigns  
Hallelujah  
  
Holy, Holy, Are you Lord God Almighty  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Worthy is the Lamb  
You are Holy, Holy  
Are you Lord God Almighty  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Worthy is the Lamb  
  
You are Holy, Holy  
Are you Lord God Almighty  
Worthy is the Lamb  
Worthy is the Lamb  
(repeat)

[Chorus:]  
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord  
Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna  
Blessed is he who comes in the name of the Lord  
Hosanna, Hosanna, Hosanna  
King of Israel welcome to our hearts  
Here to reign in righteousness  
Oh Ruler of the world, Ruler of our hearts  
Now ascend Your throne  
You are the King of Kings  
Hosanna  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To Jerusalem, to the sons of man  
Riding on in gentle strength  
Oh come to save Your own, come to give Your life  
The Kingdom is at hand  
You are the King of Kings  
Hosanna  
  
[Chorus]  
  
King of Israel welcome to our hearts  
Here to reign in righteousness  
Oh Ruler of the world, Ruler of our hearts  
Now ascend Your throne  
You are the King of Kings  
Hosanna  
  
[Chorus]

(Tell me) How long will we grovel at the feet of wealth and power  
(Tell me) How long will we bow down to that golden calf  
How long will be too long  
(Tell me) How long will we curtsy to the whims of new religion  
How long will we water down the truth  
'Til truth is no more  
How long will be too long  
  
[Chorus]  
The power of faith and love  
Can change the stuff we're made of  
But still we wait  
(Tell me) How long will be too long  
  
(Tell me) How long will we drink from the chalice of indifference  
Neither be hot or be cold  
Can a sober soul know  
How long will be too long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there not more to us  
Than cursed dust to dust  
I feel my hope fading  
How long will be too long  
  
How long will be too long  
  
(Tell me) How long will we travel from the ways that God intended  
Won't it all tumble down if His holy wrath comes  
How long will be too long  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The power of faith and love  
Can change the stuff we're made of  
When will it be too late  
How long will be too long  
How long will be too long  
How long will be too long

Tell me when the time we had slipped away  
Tomorrow turned to yesterday and I don't know how  
Tell me what can stop this river of tears  
It's been building up for years for this moment now  
  
Here I stand arms open wide  
I've held you close, kept you safe  
Till you could fly  
  
Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend  
And how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye  
  
Tell me why does following your dreams  
Take you far away from me and I knew that it would  
  
Tell me how to feel the space you left behind  
And how to laugh instead of cry and how to say goodbye  
  
Here I stand arms open wide  
I've held you close, kept you safe  
Till you could fly  
  
Tell me where the road ahead is gonna bend  
And how to harness up the wind and how to say goodbye

God, for the life of me  
I don't know why  
We hurt each other  
In the name of what is right.  
God, for the life of me  
I don't understand  
Echos everyday of man's  
Inhumanity to man.  
Man's inhumanity to man.  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a river of sorrow  
Running through my heart.  
Through the long night I will follow  
The glimmer in the dark.  
Lord, you are the human spark.  
  
God, for the life of me  
I cannot explain  
How people born of love  
Lose their way to hate.  
Oh, there's gotta be a better way.  
  
[Chorus]

I am not passers by, I am not a white lie  
I am not left to die, I am love, I am love  
I am not feeling sad, I am not a few fad  
I am not quickly mad, I am love, I am love  
  
You can try to hide, you can try to run  
But you'll never run far enough  
This is my flesh, this is my blood  
And I am love  
You can fly up high, You can dig down deep  
You can flee to the west  
You can flee to the east  
But you can't escape what I've done  
I am love  
  
I am not standing by, i am not letting go  
I am not leaving you, i am love, i am love  
My blood feel like the rain  
I did not bleed in vain  
But from my veins  
I am love

Looking at the future  
Who can tell you what is going on  
It seems we have become the generation  
Of wars and bombs  
And the heart grows weak  
And the fear grows strong  
That the day may come and it may not be very long  
And you want to run  
But you don't know where  
So where do you go  
I know  
And I tell you  
  
[Chorus]  
I am sure there will be a day  
But it will not be like the nations say  
The Lord will come when this life is through  
And His deep desire is to be with you  
Hearts will fly when the new world starts  
And joy will rise like the morning star  
God will meet every cry of the heart  
And it's my prayer  
I want you to be there  
  
I like to think about the new creation  
Things that God will do  
So every now and then I stop and close my eyes  
I enjoy the view  
And the heart grows strong  
And the fear grows weak  
And I cannot wait for the new world to come to me  
And while I dream  
Oh, I pray for you  
Cause He wants you to go  
I know  
And I tell you  
  
[Chorus]

Once upon a time  
I was faithless, strutting blind  
Through the valley of the lost  
So now you find it rather strange  
When you hear me claim the name  
Of the one who bears the cross, and I say  
  
[Chorus]  
I believe in You now  
A new light is showing me how  
I used to walk in the shadows of doubt  
But I believe in you now  
  
Will there ever come a day  
When you follow in the way  
Of the truth that sets you free?  
To where the thunder of a voice  
And the echo of a choice  
Will bring you to your knees  
No longer running through the night  
A conversion to the light  
Giving way to disbelief, and you say  
  
[Chorus]

Seems like it was only yesterday  
She was living here  
Yea, she was living here  
Lord knows why He's taken her away  
It isn't very clear, no it isn't very clear  
Into every life a little rain must fall  
And losing one you love is like a storm  
But storms are passing  
  
[Chorus]  
I hear Leesha  
Singing in heaven tonight  
And in between the sadness  
I hear Leesha  
Telling me that she's alright  
  
Life goes on even after life  
That's what I believe  
Yea, that's what I believe  
Leesha's gone, but she will still survive  
In a memory that I'm keeping here with me  
Silencing the voice of mortal tragedy  
Listening to whispers of the soul  
All is peaceful  
  
[Chorus]

Everybody's talkin' in the homeroom  
Plans are being made for after school  
Should you tell them how you're really feelin'  
Or go along and play it cool  
Well, I know, I know  
How it feels, I know, I know  
  
Everybody's talkin', about a good time  
Something tells you something isn't right  
But when you're lonely and the pressure's on you  
It's really hard to stand and fight  
  
Well, I know, I know  
How you feel  
  
Torn between the mind of the crowd  
And the matters of the heart  
  
I know, I know  
How you feel, I know, I know  
  
There's a light that holds you in the darkness  
There's a candle burning in the wind  
And if you can lean upon the Father  
You can find the strength within  
  
Well, I know, I know  
That you can  
  
Now it seems like everybody's against you  
And no one really cares  
  
You don't know who to trust,  
You don't know where to turn  
Well at least you know you've got a prayer  
So reach out for the one who understands you  
Oh, He's been there  
  
He knows, He knows  
How you feel  
  
Well, I know, that He knows, He knows  
I know, I know, that He knows

Who is the you that no one else can see  
In your heart, a lonely one afraid to be  
Lost again, need a friend  
  
You hide your soul to keep the hurt inside  
All alone, your tears call out into the night  
Is He there, does He care  
  
[Chorus]  
Yes, I know your name  
Every prayer you pray  
I'm the One Who brought you to this place  
The Voice Who sings to you  
The Hand that clings to you  
Oh My child, I've always known your name, known your name  
  
I hold you close to me, close to heart  
And this kind of love will find you anywhere you are  
Never fear, I am here  
  
[Chorus]

Once a true believer  
Once there was a fire in your soul  
You were the epitome of blessed faith astir  
With thirst for holiness  
And hunger for the Word  
Now you move in other circles  
To the beat of different drums  
And I see only glimpses of the one you used to be  
The inspiration that you were to me'  
  
[Chorus]  
I miss the way His love would dance within your eyes  
I miss the way His heart was the soul of your life  
And somewhere in the saddest part of heaven's room  
Our Father sheds a tear for you  
He's missing you, too  
  
Some are calling you a prodigal  
Some aren't calling you at all  
But far away someone is calling you back home  
Do you hear it anymore out there on your own  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Once a true believer  
Once there was a fire in your soul  
You were the epitome of blessed faith astir  
With thirst for holiness  
And hunger for the Word  
Now you move in other circles  
To the beat of different drums  
And I see only glimpses of the one you used to be  
The inspiration that you were to me

Lord, You're leading me  
With a cloud by day  
And then in the night  
The glow of a burning flame  
  
And everywhere I go I see you  
Everywhere I go I see you  
  
And You take my hand  
And You wash it clean  
I know the promised land  
Is light years ahead of me  
  
And everywhere I go I see you  
Everywhere I go I see you  
  
And the eagle flies  
And the rivers run  
I look through the night  
I can see the risin' sun  
  
And everywhere I go I see you  
Everywhere I go I see you  
  
Well, the grass will die  
And the flowers fall  
But Your Word's alive  
Will be after all  
  
And everywhere I go I see you  
Everywhere I go I see you

I saw you  
And you saw me  
And I didn't even know your name  
Just one look  
That was all it took  
And I knew I'd never be the same  
If walkin' on air compares to what I feel  
Then how can I keep it sealed when  
  
[Chorus]  
I want to tell the world  
If the smile on my face  
Hasn't given me away already  
I want to tell the world  
There ain't no way to hide it  
Your love has got me flyin' high  
Since the day  
  
That you looked my way  
I knew we were meant to be together  
Now I thank the Lord  
For a love like yours  
Cause I know it's gonna last forever  
It's hard to believe my dreams have all come true  
And I'm so in love with you that  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want the world to know  
Love has got me good to go  
[I want to tell the world, I want to tell the world]  
I have got to get it out  
She is all I think about  
[I want to tell the world, I want to tell the world]  
It's something' that I need to say  
Love has overtaken me  
  
[Chorus]

When you feel the sunlight  
Fade into the cold night  
Don't know where to turn  
I don't know where to turn  
And all the dreams you're dreaming  
Seem to lose their meaning  
Let me in your world  
Baby, let me in your world  
All you need is someone you can hold  
Don't be sad, you're not alone  
  
[Chorus]  
I will be here for you  
Somewhere in the night  
Somewhere in the night  
I'll shine a light for you  
Somewhere in the night  
I'll be standing by  
I will be here for you  
  
In this world of strangers  
Of cold and friendly faces  
Someone you can trust  
Oh there's someone you can trust  
I will be your shelter  
I'll give you my shoulder  
Just reach out for my love  
Reach out for my love  
Call my name and my heart will hear  
I will be there, there's nothing to fear  
  
[Chorus]

Sometimes I wonder if my beating heart has a reason  
The thought of breathing only takes my breath away  
I've spent so many nights wrestling with this feeling  
Do I have the strength to make it through the day  
But I was never meant  
To walk this road alone  
I can always trust you  
When you say  
  
I will carry you  
Be your strength  
And pull you through  
Reach for me  
And take my hand  
We will pray  
And we will stand  
In a world  
Crying out for peace  
Let your heart be strong  
For when I am weak  
You will carry me  
  
Sometimes you wonder if the road you're on has a reason  
It's hard to go on when you just don't know  
We can shoulder all the weight of life between us  
Until the fear of what we cannot see is gone  
Cause we were never meant  
To walk this road alone  
We are bound together  
When we say

Hey boy - did you find out  
Whatcha had to know - 'n what it's all about  
When you started to move - just a step at a time  
You never wanted to fall  
You took a chance on the wild side  
Hey, girl - can'tcha come down  
Are ya way at the top - afraid of somethin' you found  
Then you try to go back - not as easy to do  
Did you find who you are  
From a dance on the wild side  
  
I know sometimes it's hard for you  
To keep your feet upon the path that you've chosen  
It's not for you to walk alone  
Together we can take this road where it's going - hang on  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
Stand by me - stand right here  
The time has come to say it clear  
Now don't give up - but don't give in  
We will stand together to the end  
And I'll be around - I'll be around, yeah  
  
No joke - the sooner you find  
It happens all the same - for every mother's child  
when you walk in the dark - then you stumble and fall  
It's a part of it all  
When we dance on the wild side  
  
But everybody needs someone  
Who loves 'em through the toughest times - while they're growing - yah  
Who keeps a candle burning  
When the darkness covers up the path where they're going - hang on  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Stand by me - stand right here  
The time has come to say it clear  
Now don't give up - don't give in  
We will stand together to the end  
And I'll be around - come what may  
Heaven hears us when we pray  
So don't give up - but don't give in  
We will stand together to the end  
I will be there, my good friend  
And I'll be around  
  
Be around, I'll be around...  
I'll walk this road with you  
wherever it may wind  
And I'll be around  
  
[Chorus 2]

Wandering the road of desperate life  
Aimlessly beneath a barren sky  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
So afraid that you will not be found  
It won't be long before your sun goes down  
Just leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
[Chorus]  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
Just leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
A troubled mind and a doubter's heart  
You wonder how you ever got this far  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
Vultures of darkness ate the crumbs you left  
You got no way to retrace your steps  
Just leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
You're lost and alone  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
So let it go and turn it over to  
The one who chose to give his life for you  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home  
  
Hear me calling  
Hear me calling  
You're lost and alone  
Leave it to me  
I'll lead you home

I see you smiling at me  
And I fall into a daydream  
Don't know what all of this means  
Oh, is it love?  
Logic is slipping away  
My heart's on a runaway train  
  
I'm gone, yes I'm gone, yes I'm gone and  
It feels so right  
  
Each time I look in your eyes  
So glad you came into my life  
Much more than an emotional high  
Oh, this is love  
I know that I've made up my mind  
I'll stay for the rest of my life

I am holding to the joy of my salvation  
I am glad to have a life that always grows  
And if the Word of God is any indication  
I am doing even better than I know  
I am doing even better than I know  
There's a joy that even people of the world find  
In every good and perfect gift the Father sends  
So I thank the Lord that I was born the first time  
But I thank Him more that I was born again  
Oh, I thank Him more that I was born again  
  
Chorus:  
I am up  
Like the sun is up  
I can feel my life on a rise  
I am up  
Like the stars at night  
I get up on bein' alive  
I am up  
Like the Lord is up  
And my life is filled with His life  
I was freed and I am saved  
I am up  
I am up  
  
There are times life is so fine I can't contain it  
Everywhere I look I see what God had done  
And I don't have to work and worry to sustain it  
When I walk with God His joy will always come  
When I walk with God His joy will always come  
  
[Chorus]

I walked this road  
So very long ago  
To show the way  
So you would know  
I walked the road  
With holes in my hands in feet  
To make the way  
Come follow me  
  
[Chorus:]  
No, you are not alone  
You will be free indeed  
The journey begins and ends  
With me  
One million miles  
It starts with a step or two  
What are you waiting for?  
I'm waiting for you  
  
You run the race  
Thinking you've almost won  
Then you may find  
You've only begun  
  
You're on the road  
Thinking you're far from here  
And suddenly find  
You're very near  
  
[Chorus:]

[Chorus]  
I really want to see you  
I really want to touch you  
If only I could hold you in my arms again  
I really want to reach you  
Forever to be with you  
If only I could hold you in my arms again  
  
It was written in the stars  
On the pages of my heart  
Oh, that someday I would find  
The love I feel for you tonight  
  
On the ocean of our dreams  
Like a prayer you came to me  
And the longing that had been  
Found its ending in your eyes  
And I am missing you tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Across the waves, across the sea  
Separating you from me  
Here's a promise and it's mine  
I will love you for all time  
I'm wishing you were here tonight  
  
[Chorus]

On the stairs she sits and waits  
She's crying out but nobody even cares  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
Holding in the hurt and pain  
Looking for love to come pull her from this place  
(Pull her from this place)  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence  
  
Sometimes we're loudest when  
The doors are shut and no one can see our face  
(No one can see our face)  
But it seems we're quiet when  
Someone needs a touch of heaven's grace, oh yeah  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence  
  
We are all God's children  
We need to count off all we've been given, oh yeah  
We are all God's children  
We need to tell off all we've been given, oh yeah, oh yeah  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay  
I'm not gonna walk away  
  
I'm not gonna sit and stay in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence, yeah, in silence  
I'm not gonna walk away in silence

Joy to the world  
The Lord has come  
Let earth receive her king  
Let every heart  
Prepare him room  
And heaven and nature sing  
And heaven and nature sing  
And Heaven, and heaven and nature sing  
  
Joy to the earth  
The Savior reigns  
Let men their songs employ  
While fields and floods  
Rocks, hills, and plains  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat the sounding joy  
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy  
  
He rules the world  
With truth and grace  
And makes the nations prove  
The glories of His righteousness  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders of His love  
And wonders, wonders of His love

Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
Jingle bells, jingle bells  
Jingle all the way  
Oh what fun it is to ride in a one horse open sleigh  
On Dasher, on Dancer, on Prancer, on Vixen  
On Comet, on Cupid, on Donner, on Blitzen  
Put on your bells, your Christmas bells  
  
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride  
Christmas time is here again  
Come on, we're going for a sleigh ride  
To spread good cheer again  
From the top of the chimney to the top of the wall  
Dash away, dash away, dash away all  
  
Old Saint Nicholas, he took a flight  
The moon was shining bright  
Bring out the bells  
Ol' Saint Nick was riding through the sky  
You should have seen those reindeer fly  
  
Bring out the bells, it's a holiday season  
Bring out the bells, it's a happy time  
Bring out the bells, we've got a good reason  
To ring the bells and hear those pretty bells chime

Sun comes up Sunday morn  
On the little church where I been since I was born  
And there he stood a hearty smile  
You could hear his voice ringing out for a country mile  
  
And he could place your mind at ease  
With his tenderness and a heart  
That aimed to please  
A pauper's hands a farmer's clothes  
Just a preacher man we called Kentucky Rose  
  
He worked the soul like he worked the land  
He spoke in ways that anyone could understand  
Simple words of simple faith  
And when it came to love  
He would go out of his way  
  
A helping hand  
A soothing chat  
And he practiced what he preached imagine that  
And as far as kindness goes  
There was none compared to old Kentucky Rose  
  
Evening stroll 'cross Shyler's bridge  
That's when he saw the boy  
Trapped below that rocky ridge  
He knew the danger he would face  
But it's as if he saved the child  
Only to take his place  
  
For on that ridge of stone and ice  
Kentucky met his maker in a sacrifice  
Why he's gone  
God only knows  
Maybe for the company of his Kentucky Rose  
  
So peaceful in his Sunday best  
He was buried on a hill and laid to rest  
When people heard they came in droves  
To say their last good-byes to sweet Kentucky Rose  
  
Now, on that hill  
One flower grows  
They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose  
They say it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose  
I believe it is the spirit of Kentucky Rose

Here we are on a boat out on the sea  
Off the coast of Africa  
Heading for peaceful shores  
With a cast of strangers  
To an island hideaway  
I hear you telling me  
Of the place we soon will be  
A rebirth from life's demise  
Where the world is still--it's ideal  
Anything you dream is real  
It's Hotel Paradise  
And you say it's nice  
(when you run to)  
Lamu--far away  
Leave the pain far behind you  
Hoping it won't find you in  
Lamu--far away  
You say it's there that you can run  
From the one inside of you  
  
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la la  
La la la la la la la la la la  
  
So here we are on an island in the sea  
Near the coast of Africa  
And when it's right--Lamu nights,  
They can be so inviting  
Heaven here on earth  
But I hear you telling me  
This is everything you need  
Well, I don't think it's true  
'Cause the way you feel isn't real  
You attempt to try and fill  
the void that's digging through  
And it's killing you (when you run to)  
  
Lamu--far away  
Tho' that pain was behind you  
It can even find you in  
Lamu--far away  
Because you never can run  
From the one inside of you  
  
I hear you telling me  
Of the place we soon will be  
A rebirth from life's demise  
Where the world is still--it's ideal  
Anything you dream is real  
It's Hotel Paradise  
And you say it's nice  
(when you run to)  
  
Lamu--far away  
Leave the pain far behind you  
Hoping it won't find you in  
Lamu--far away  
Tho' that pain was behind you  
It can even find you in  
Lamu--far away  
Because you never can run  
From the one inside of you

Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Repeat  
  
The Lord reigns, let the earth be glad  
Let the distance shores rejoice  
Clouds and thick darkness surround Him  
Righteousness and justice are the foundation of His throne  
A fire goes before Him and consumes His foes on every side  
His lightning lights up the world  
The earth sees and trembles  
The mountains melt like wax before the Lord  
Before the Lord of all the earth  
The heavens proclaim His righteousness  
And all peoples will see His glory  
  
We want to see Your glory, God!  
Do you want to see His glory?  
Lift your voices, lift your hands!  
  
Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven  
Let it rain, let it rain.  
Open the floodgates of heaven

I'm looking at you, old friend of mine  
There's no use pretending that everything's fine  
Now don't be so brave, don't be so proud  
I want you to know that I'm here for you now  
  
I can see you hurting and it's hurting me  
It doesn't have to be this way  
  
[Chorus]  
(Somebody gonna hold your head up)  
If you let me hold you closer  
(Somebody gonna show you the light)  
Let me know you  
(Somebody gonna hold your head up)  
Let me show you the way  
(Somebody gonna see you right)  
  
I'm feeling for you, feeling so much  
When this heart is big enough for the both of us  
I'll give you my love if you give me your pain  
I'll hold it inside of me 'till you're stronger again  
  
Well, I hate seeing you so far away  
When not a word can say it enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll be your rock for this day  
When I hear you calling out my name  
Cause I know you'd only do the same for me  
  
[Chorus]

Never should have tasted that forbidden fruit  
Tell me why do I always do  
What I don't want to do  
Now, I'm the only reaper of the seeds that I sow  
And when I walk the field of my stubborn will  
It's a hard row to hoe  
There's a price for getting smarter  
So I pay what I owe  
While bridges burn  
Let the shadow fall behind me  
I am wiser I know  
We live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning  
Is it out of the fire, back in to the pan  
Is once enough to let it all sink in-or will I do it again  
A time for understanding has now come of age  
So I heed the word of the counselor and the voice of the sage  
Try to see the meaning  
Read between every line  
When pages turn  
There'll be no room for explaining what has been well-defined  
We live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning  
  
An engaging temptation had me doing time  
Cause when it starts a fire under strong desire  
We are partners in crime  
But hindsight is clearer  
I can where I've gone and never return  
It's a new man in the mirror  
It's a new freedom song to live and learn  
Always living and learning  
Always living and learning

You painted me a picture of tomorrow  
A place where you and I walked hand in hand  
A world without despair and without shadows  
But things just didn't turn out how we'd planned  
Now you're gone  
  
[Chorus:]  
And I believe that there is somewhere  
Where the angels fill the sky  
And I believe we'll live forever  
You and I, you and I  
Will never die  
  
I wonder if you knew that you were leaving  
I thought that I saw something in your eyes  
You painted me a picture of believing  
I'll see you there on the other side  
And I'll be there

Preach the Gospel to all the world,  
And if necessary, use words. St. Francis of Assisi  
  
We're passengers aboard the train  
Silent little lambs amidst the pain  
That's no longer good enough  
And when it's time to speak our faith  
We use a language no one can explain  
That's no longer good enough  
  
And God knows it's a shame  
As we look to pass the flame  
We are not the worthy bearers of his name  
  
[Chorus]  
For the world to know the truth  
There can be no greater proof  
Than to live the life, live the life  
There's no love that's quite as pure  
There's no pain we can't endure  
If we live the life, live the life  
Be a light for all to see  
For every act of love will set you free  
  
There's something beautiful and bold  
The power of a million human souls  
Come together as one  
And each in turn goes out to lead  
Another by his word, his love, his deed  
Now the circle is done  
  
It all comes back to One  
For it is He and He alone  
Who has lived the only perfect life we've known  
  
[Chorus]

If I could, I would tell you why  
The first time I saw her I could touch the sky  
I turned to stone, and I could not speak  
She had the ability to make me weep  
  
Always wishing, always hoping  
That she'll get the message from the bottom of my heart  
Let's together share forever  
It's just a matter of time  
  
I had to wait and just let her breathe  
That's never been easy for a man to see  
She moved slow and she took her time  
She kept me guessing what was on her mind  
  
Always wishing, always hoping  
That you'd get the message from the bottom of my heart  
Let's forever be together  
It's just a matter of time

The Voice  
  
Follow the footsteps  
Or travel down your own road  
Designing your fate  
Hear what your heart says  
Still you decide which way to go  
Your life's an open gate  
  
(CHORUS)  
'Le bon et 'le mal  
These are the voices  
We nous somme liberti'  
We make the choices  
  
Echoes of laughter  
Dancing in distant corridors  
With the tears of hearts undone  
Dreams we chase after  
Give us the key to any door  
We are what we become  
  
(REPEAT CHORUS)  
  
Holding and reaching  
We face the calm, we face the fear  
As we learn to win and love  
Voices and speaking  
Still we hear what we want to hear  
Our life is ours to choose  
  
Chorus  
  
  
Good King Wenceslaus  
  
Good King Wenceslaus looked out on the feast of Stephen.  
When the snow lay round about, deep and crisp and even.  
Brightly shone the moon that night, though the frost was cruel,  
When a poor man came in sight, gathering winter fuel.  
  
Hither page and stand by me if thou knowst it telling  
Yonder peasant, who is he, where and what his dwelling?  
Sire, he lives a good league hence, underneath the mountain,  
Right against the forest fence, by Saint Agnes' fountain.  
  
Bring me flesh and bring me wine, bring me pinelogs hither  
Thou and I will see him dine when we bear them thither  
Page and monarch forth they went, forth they went together  
Through the rude winds wild lament, and the bitter weather.  
  
Sire the night is darker now, and the wind blows stronger  
Fails my heart, I know not how, I can go no longer.  
Mark my footsteps my good page, tread thou in them boldly  
Thou shalt find the winter's rage freeze thy blood less coldly.  
  
In his master's steps he trod where the snow lay dinted  
Heat was in the very sod which the saint had printed  
Therefore Christian men be sure, wealth or rank possessing,  
Ye who now will bless the poor, shall yourselves find blessing.  
  
  
Hark the Herald Angels Sing  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
And the mountains in reply  
Echo back their joyus strains  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo (x4)  
  
Come to Bethlehem and see  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Him whose birth the angels sing  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Come adore on bended knee  
Christ the Lord the newborn king  
  
Gloria O Gloria in excelsis Deo (x4)  
  
Angels we have heard on high  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Sweetly singing o'er the plains  
(Gloria O sing Gloria)  
Jesus Lord of heav'n and earth  
With us sing our Savior's birth  
  
Gloria O Gloria in exelsis Deo (x8)  
  
Alleluia

Still searching for that boy who had the faith to move a mountain.  
Want the fire back.  
  
Another question in me  
One for the powers that be  
It's got me thrown and so  
I Put on my poker face  
And try to figure it out  
This undeniable doubt  
A common occurrence  
Feeling so out of place  
  
Guarded and cynical now  
Can't help but wondering how  
My heart evolved into a  
Rock beating inside of me  
So I reel, such a stoic ordeal  
Where's that feeling that I don't feel?  
  
[Chorus]  
There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
And like a child he would believe without a reason  
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and  
I've been searching for that missing person  
  
Under a lavender moon  
So many thoughts consume me  
Who dimmed that glowing light  
That once burned so bright in me  
Is this a radical phase  
A problematical age  
That keeps me running  
From all that I used to be  
  
Is there a way to return  
Is there a way to unlearn  
That carnal knowledge  
That's chipping away at my soul  
I've been gone too long  
Will I ever find my way home?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was a boy who had the faith to move a mountain  
And like a child he would believe without a reason  
Without a trace he disappeared into the void and  
I've been searching for that missing person  
He used to want to try to walk the straight and narrow  
He had a fire and he could feel it in the marrow  
It's been a long time and I haven't seen him lately but  
I've been searching for that missing person

I am only human  
Struggling to find  
Confidence in all that I believe  
You are only holy  
You are love defined  
And you have said to ask and I'll receive  
So I have come to pray  
That you will come and fill  
The hunger here inside me to grow  
Stronger in the faith  
There's a longing and a need  
To have you ever closer  
Come fill me  
Cause when you move in me  
It's like a symphony  
The timeless melody  
That soothes my soul  
Though silent I can tell  
That you're alive and well  
Cause I can feel you move  
In me  
What they try to tell me  
Is that your love is falseWhat they try to tell me  
Is that Your is false  
And faith is just a way  
I choose to feel  
And that there was no meaning  
To You upon the cross  
And I should reach for something that is real  
And when those words are said  
The questions in me start  
And I don't have any answers  
Until I stop thinking with my head  
And start listening to my heart  
And there I find my assurance  
I tell them  
Chorus

I have been unfaithful  
I have been unworthy  
I have been unrighteous  
And I have been unmerciful  
  
I have been unreachable  
I have been unteachable  
I have been unwilling  
And I have been undesirable  
  
[Chorus]  
Sometimes, I have been unwise  
I've been undone by what I'm unsure of  
But because of you, and all that you went through  
I know that I have never been unloved  
  
I have been unbroken  
I have been unmended  
I have been uneasy  
And I've been unapproachable  
  
I've been unemotional  
I've been unexceptional  
I've been undecided  
And I have been unqualified  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Unaware, I have been unfair  
I've been unfit for blessings from above  
But even I can see the sacrifice you made for me  
To show that I have never been unloved

No eye had seen  
No ear had heard  
'Til hosts on high  
Proclaimed the birth  
And heaven brought down  
(Quietly with no one watching)  
Its only child  
(From the womb of perfect peace)  
The son of man  
(Wellspring of our joy delivered)  
The world reconciled  
(Into earthly destiny)  
  
And song broke forth  
Angelic strain  
And none could help  
But sing the name  
  
Emmanuel  
(Kyrie eleison we sing)  
Emmanuel  
(Glory to the newborn King)  
Emmanuel  
(Mortal and immortal voices)  
Emmanuel  
(Endless praises echoing)

Woa-o-woa-oah-Woa-o-woa-oah  
What can wash away my sins  
(There's) Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
What can make me whole again  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
This is all my righteousness  
It's nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
This is all my hope and peace  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus  
Nothing but the blood of Jesus

Oh Lord, You're beautiful  
Your face is all I seek  
For when Your eyes are on this child  
Your grace abounds to me, yeah

Your face is all I seek  
For when Your eyes are on this child  
Your grace abounds to me

Oh Lord, You're beautiful, yes You are, oh Lord  
Oh Lord, oh Lord, You're beautiful, yes You are  
Lord, You're beautiful

I want to see You  
  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord  
Open the eyes of my heart

I want to see You  
  
To see You high and lifted up  
Shinin' in the light of Your glory  
Pour out Your power and love  
As we sing holy, holy, holy  
  
Open the eyes of my heart, Lord

Pour out Your power and love  
As we sing holy, holy, holy  
  
To see You high and lifted up  
Shinin' in the light of Your glory  
Pour out Your power and love  
As we sing holy, holy, holy  
  
To see You high and lifted up  
Shinin' in the light of Your glory  
Pour out Your power and love  
As we sing holy, holy, holy  
  
Holy, holy, holy  
We cry holy, holy, holy  
You are holy, holy, holy  
I want to see you  
  
Holy, holy, holy

You are holy, holy, holy  
I want to see you

Holy, holy, holy,  
I want to see you

Take stock of your life  
What's wrong and what's right  
Empty pockets, got no green  
Don't you know sunshine is free  
What breaks have you had  
Some good and some bad  
Want to go but got no car  
Dreaming dreams can take you far  
  
[Chorus]  
You will find that life's worth living  
In this world, it's out of this world  
With a little love and a little giving  
In this world, it's out of this world  
  
Look to the future  
Who's in the picture  
Say your love life's just a dream  
Still you've got a friend in me  
  
Today, tomorrow  
Laughter and sorrow  
Gonna be some lows and highs  
Might as well enjoy the ride  
  
[Chorus]

The wind is moving  
But I am standing still  
A life of pages  
Waiting to be filled  
A heart that's hopeful  
A head that's full of dreams  
But this becoming  
Is harder than it seems  
Feels like I'm  
  
[Chorus]  
Looking for a reason  
Roaming through the night to find  
My place in this world  
My place in this world  
Not a lot to lean on  
I need Your light to help me find  
My place in this world  
My place in this world  
  
If there are millions  
Down on their knees  
Among the many  
Can you still hear me?  
Hear me asking  
Where do I belong?  
Is there a vision  
That I can call my own?  
Show me I'm  
  
[Chorus]

Here is where the road divides  
Here is where we realize  
The sculpting of the Father's great design  
Through' time you've been a friend to me  
But time is now the enemy  
I wish we didn't have to say goodbye  
But I know the road He chose for me  
Is not the road he chose for you  
So as we chase the dreams we're after  
  
[Chorus]  
Pray for me and I'll pray for you  
Pray that we will keep the common ground  
Won't you pray for me and I'll pray for you  
And one day love will bring us back around again  
  
Painted on our tapestry  
We see the way it has to be  
Weaving through' the laughter and the tears  
But love will be the tie that binds us  
To the time we leave behind us  
Memories will be our souvenirs  
And I know that through' it all  
The hardest part of love is letting go  
But there's a greater love that holds us

Where the angels see  
You are praised as You should be.  
But how can I express  
My yearning for Your Holiness.  
May it be (that)  
  
[Chorus]  
I will open my heart  
Search me in the deepest part.  
And I will stand in cleansing fire,  
By You, purified,  
By You I'm purified.  
  
Savior of my soul  
To your strength I yield control.  
Purge me of my stain  
Sin will lose it's mortal reign.  
Make me free (and)

Another million miles from the Truth now  
I know there's peace but I can't seem  
To figure out how  
To stop this race that's taking over me  
I'm under the gun I wait for You to see  
  
Oh, please reach out to me  
Open my eyes to see  
I'm running from you now  
Come rescue me somehow  
  
Another scar from fighting the Truth now  
Has left me like a stranger to my need now  
A masquerade, a game to figure out now  
A cruel charade I cannot scream aloud  
  
A narrow stretch of road in the way now  
A heavy load still hanging on to me now  
I'm in a maze that I can't seem to get out  
Without a view from these shoulders of doubt

On the street it never changes  
There's a chill in the air  
Icy people, empty faces  
Not a word, not a soul who cares  
Do you give up  
Have you given in to the lie that a heart never changes  
Don't be fooled by what you see there  
Another man with another case of  
Chorus:  
One restless heart  
Who never could find love  
Too many hurts  
To reach out again  
How can he know  
Love still wants to find him  
One restless shell of a man  
  
Don't look away  
In a moment his life could be new  
Just a moment and love could break through  
Oh finally some place to start  
For a man with a restless heart  
  
Why the fear then, why the worry  
Why the walls holding love inside  
When you're needed in the fury  
In the fighting to save men's lives  
Don't you give up  
Don't be giving in to the lie that a heart never changes  
If you reach out God'll reach in  
Bring an end to another case of  
  
Chorus  
  
One restless heart, one restless heart  
One restless heart, one restless heart  
He's got to know that love still can find him  
Love can reach any man  
  
Don't look away  
In a moment his life could be new  
Just a moment and love could break through  
Oh finally some place to start  
For a man with a restless heart  
  
Tag:  
Don't you look away  
Oh never a stranger again  
Love has saved a restless man  
Finally some place to start  
For a man with a restless heart

A Friday night affair  
Out in the city heat  
Always a party there  
Along the sordid street  
And it was guaranteed  
The place to be was Rocketown  
The drinks were two for one  
Inside the crowded bars  
The girls would make their run  
Out on the boulevard  
It was the idol place  
We lived the ways of Rocketown  
Hang around by the street light  
In the heart of the night life  
  
There came a certain man  
A stranger to the crowd  
We didn't understand  
What he was all about  
He walked a different pace  
So out of place in Rocketown  
  
They made a fool of him  
They teased him when he'd speak  
But when they knocked him down  
He'd turn the other cheek  
He told me I could find  
A life outside of Rocketown  
Hang around by the street light  
In the heart of the night life  
  
[Chorus:]  
What was his mission  
Where was he going  
Why was his heart light  
Always glowing  
All I was missing  
He stood there holding  
What was his secret  
Could I know it  
  
Some didn't like him near  
Some laughed and turned away  
But me, I longed to hear  
All that he had to say  
He had a peace of mind  
I couldn't find in Rocketown  
And when I reached down inside me  
I could feel the emptiness  
  
[Chorus]  
  
He said it's in the heart  
This change that comes to be  
Now he had done his part  
The choice was up to me  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
As we were standing there  
He said a prayer for Rocketown  
  
He walked off silently  
And prayed for me  
And Rocketown...  
  
[Chorus]

Save me, oh God  
for the waters  
have come up to my neck  
and I am sinking to the bottom where I cannot stand  
I am calling to you  
can you hear my cry?  
  
Oh my God! You've turned your eyes  
and now my heart has come alive!  
  
Chorus  
Only you have come to find me  
Only you have come to pull me out  
Only you have come to save me  
Only you have come to wrap your arms around me  
  
Save me, oh God.  
I have wondered  
and I cannot find your hand  
and I am looking for you, Father, but my eyes fail  
I am calling to you  
can you hear my cry?  
  
Oh my God! You've turned your eyes  
and now my heart has come alive  
  
Chorus  
  
Bridge  
No one has ever loved me  
like the way you loved me  
wrap your arms around  
(repeat)  
  
Chorus  
  
No one (only you have come to find me) has ever loved me  
Like the way you loved me  
(only you have come to pull me out)  
wrap your arms around  
No one (only you have come to save me) has ever loved me  
Like the what you loved me  
(wrap your arms around me)  
wrap your arms around me  
  
Chorus

Young man up on the hillside  
Teaching new ways  
Each word winning them over  
Each heart a kindled flame  
Old men watch from the outside  
Guarding their prey  
Threatened by the voice of the paragon  
Leading their lambs away  
Leading them far away  
  
[Chorus]  
Nobody knew His secret ambition  
Nobody knew His claim to fame  
He broke the old rules steeped in tradition  
He tore the holy veil away  
Questioning those in powerful position  
Running to those who called His name  
But nobody knew His secret ambition  
Was to give His life away  
  
His rage shaking the temple  
His word to the wise  
His hand healing on the seventh day  
His love wearing no disguise  
Some say, "Death to the radical  
He's way out of line."  
Some say, "Praise be the miracle  
God sends a blessed sign.  
A blessed sign for troubled times."  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
Kimu nkimaanyi  
Buli muntu alina ensiigo  
Omutima gwo gukulung 'aamye  
Buli muntu alina ensiigo  
  
Some people quietly reveal  
In the manner of the meek  
Some people shout the way they feel  
To a radical degree  
Some people sing it to express  
While others hear another call  
Some people speak with subtleness  
Some don't rely on words at all  
But let me tell you 'bout  
  
[Chorus]  
  
One thing I know  
Everybody's got a seed to sow  
let your heart of hearts  
Take you down the road  
Everybody's got a seed to sow  
  
We all are pieces of the whole  
With different feelings to evoke  
Giving distinction to the role  
Different players-different strokes  
But let me tell you 'bout  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some people walk  
Some people race  
Some people vary in their pace  
But God can use what you can give  
Within the mystery of His ways  
Don't underestimate  
  
Chorus

From the first breath of her life  
She flew straight into my arms  
I used to catch her from the swings  
When she was five  
And now she dances on the wind  
In a world as hard as stone  
She's so anxious to begin  
And ready to fly  
  
And she walks with me  
And she talks with me  
And I hold her hand in mine  
I know she'll find her way  
Like the light of day  
Cause it's love that makes her strong  
  
Though I cannot stop the rain  
And I cannot turn the tide  
And I am sure there will be things  
That break her heart  
I can only let her know  
I am always on her side  
And even as I let her go  
I'll never be far  
  
And she walks with me  
And she talks with me  
In her eyes I see her truth  
Born of her fire and grace  
As she finds her place  
Cause it's love that makes her strong  
  
And she walks with me  
And she talks with me  
In my eyes she'll see my prayer  
As she turns each page  
Through this tender age  
It is love that makes her strong  
It's her love that makes her strong

Hallelujah  

You're weighed down with regret  
You can't see the road ahead  
Or the burden on your back  
It seems the trek will never end  
The winding paths that still descend  
And up above a sky washed black  
You just can't bear to look at that  
  
[Chorus]  
Follow the signs  
Open your eyes  
Read between the lines of what you see  
Look into the soul of reality  
Open your mind  
Look at the signs  
Never look back at yesterday  
Keep your gaze steady on the narrow way  
  
Now you've found the sacred tree  
You kneel upon the broken wheat  
You watch your burden fall away  
And all the things that you once sought  
Now are counted less than lost  
For now you see the light of day  
The signs were pointing all the way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Follow the signs  
Open your eyes  
Look at the signs  
Open your mind  
Follow the signs  
  
[Chorus]

Silent night, holy night  
All is calm, all is bright  
Round yon virgin mother and child  
Holy infant so tender and mild  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Sleep in heavenly peace  
Silent night, holy night  
Shepherds quake at the sight  
Glories stream from heaven afar  
Heavenly hosts sing Alleluia  
Christ the savior is born  
Christ the savior is born  
  
Peace, joy, love  
Was sent to all of us from Heaven up above  
To every man, woman, boy, and girl  
To all God's children, all of our world  
It's our hope that your dreams may come true  
Like ours have, thanks to all of you  
Now we have just one more wish  
That you all remember this  
The true meaning of Christmas  
Christ the savior is born  
Christ the savior is born

Come  
Behold this child

Counting every moment  
Biding all my time  
Standing out here on my own  
Searching for that someone  
To heal this heart of mine  
And keep me from being alone  
But when will it be  
And how will I know  
I don't want to wait here forever  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody love me  
Come and carry me away  
Somebody need me  
To be the blue in their grey  
Somebody want me  
The way I've always dreamed it could be  
Won't somebody love me, love me  
  
I'm waiting for somebody  
To dance across the floor  
Sweeping me off of my feet  
I'm looking for the right one  
To open up that door  
And offer me a tender retreat  
It's like wanting to sing  
But needing a song  
When will I hear the music playing  
  
[Chorus]

Sexual harassment - nuclear reactors  
Natural disasters from here to L.A.  
Drug importers  
New World Order  
Wars over borders  
Murder on the subway  
  
The social classes - high rise of taxes  
Diplomats are passive with a promise again  
  
Talk of recession - people in depression  
Dow Jones, bank loans, the Japanese yen  
  
[Chorus 1:]  
I wait for Kingdom come  
When love will be here to stay  
It will change us everyone  
Someday, someday  
  
Violence in the movies  
Drive-by shootings  
Rioting and looting  
With the boys in the hood  
  
Cults and religions  
Deadly premonitions  
Fiery oppositions  
Evil battling good  
  
AIDS awareness  
Temporary marriage  
Pro-life, pro-choice  
Roe v Wade  
  
Ethics and the media  
Tabloid T.V.  
The Kennedy Conspiracy  
The Trial of O.J.  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
I wait for Kingdom come  
When love will be here to stay  
It will change us everyone  
Someday, someday  
There peace will make a stand  
and the anger will fall away  
We'll see the lion with the lamb  
Someday, someday, someday  
  
[Chorus 2:]

Son of God, purest light, Lord on high is here tonight  
Stamping through, this sacred sky suddenly our eyes behold  
Heaven's perfect plan unfold, son of God  
  
Son of God, love divine, timeless one, steps in to die  
Who could dream of such a thing with us now the King of Kings  
Man and angels bow and sing, singing Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah  
We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah  
We're singing Gloria, Hallelujah  
We're singing Gloria

Oh the happiest Christmas  
Is a homecoming Christmas  
With the snow fluttering down 'til the world seems new  
(chorus)  
Bright candles burning  
Old friends returning  
The wishes of children coming true  
And the happiest wishes are just old fashioned wishes  
May your days be merry, your sorrows be small  
May the ones you love be near you  
That's the happiest Christmas of all  
repeat chorus  
  
  

Got our feet on a narrow road  
Got our eyes on the one who will be our goal  
and our brothers at our side  
If we stumble we won't fall  
If we miss the mark He'll be there after all  
With an everlasting prize  
The race is on  
  
[Chorus]  
Cone on and go  
Leave behind the sin you find  
That slows your time  
Come on and go  
You know the race is on  
Come on and go  
Straight ahead be safely led  
By him instead  
Come on and go  
You know the race is on  
  
Lord I try running my own race  
Losin' ground, losin' hope  
Losin' sight of your face  
And I'm ready to retire  
  
Then I'm back on your solid ground  
You remind me of the strength  
That in you I've found  
And you fill me with your fire  
The race is on  
  
[Chorus]

When I survey the wondrous cross  
On which the Prince of Glory died  
My richest gain I count but loss  
And pour contempt on all my pride  
  
See from His head His hands His feet  
Sorrow and love flow mingled down  
Did e'er such love and sorrow meet  
Or thorns compose so rich a crown  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Bids me come and die and find  
That I may truly live  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
All who gather here  
By grace draw near  
And bless your name  
  
Were the whole realm of nature mine  
That were an offering far too small  
Love so amazing so divine  
Demands my soul my life my all  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Bids me come and die and find  
That I may truly live  
  
Oh the wonderful cross  
Oh the wonderful cross  
All who gather here  
By grace draw near  
And bless your name

I don't know how to breathe  
I don't know how to leave You  
I don't know what to say  
And who am I to say it anyway?  
  
But there is always a song  
And I'll try to sing along over You  
I can hear it being sung  
All of Heaven sings along over You  
  
I hardly know Your name  
I didn't come to save You  
Your smile just broke my heart  
Now You're in my heart  
I know You'll never leave me  
  
But there is always a song  
And I'll try to sing along over You  
I can hear it being sung  
All of Heaven sings along over You  
  
But there is always a song  
And I'll try to sing along over You  
  
Sing, sing like you've never sung  
Sing for your joy to come  
Sing, sing like you've never sung  
Sing of my joy to come  
  
There is always a song  
And I'll try to sing along over You  
I can hear it being sung  
All of Heaven sings along over You  
  
There is always a song  
And I'll try to sing along over You  
There is always a song  
And I'll try to sing along over You  
Always for You

Follow the footsteps  
Or travel down your own road  
Designing your fate  
Hear what your heart says  
Still you decide which way to go  
Your life's an open gate  
Chorus:  
'Le bon et 'le mal  
These are the voices  
We nous somme liberti'  
We make the choices  
  
Echoes of laughter  
Dancing in distant corridors  
With the tears of hearts undone  
Dreams we chase after  
Give us the key to any door  
We are what we become  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Holding and reaching  
We face the calm, we face the fear  
As we learn to win and lose  
Voices are speaking  
Still we hear what we want to hear  
Our life is ours to choose  
  
[Chorus]

A silent call from a distant land  
Crying for a helping hand, so  
How long will it go on?  
Ignorance and vanity  
Supersede humanity, so  
How long it will go on?  
I want to know how long will it go on?  
  
We can't wait any longer  
They're crying out, doesn't it matter  
We can't wait any longer  
No, no. Too long in a slumber  
Shake it up,wake it up now.  
We can't wait any longer. No, no.  
  
Another child is laid to rest  
Another day of hopelessness, so  
How long it will go on?  
And every day we're on the fence brings  
Another fatal consequence, so  
How long will it go on?  
I want to know, how long will it go on?  
  
Yuko awezayo kusikia kilio chetu? (Can somebody hear us crying out?)  
Twaomba msaada wenu (Somebody help us)  
Aweko mwenye kuttuoka (Somebody save us)  
Aweko mwenye kutupa uhuru (Somebody free us)

What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him Lord  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
So bring Him incense, gold, and myth  
Come peasant, king, to own Him  
The King of kings, salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him Lord  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him Lord  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him Lord  
The Babe, the Son of Mary

[Chorus:]  
Word of mouth is the counselor  
There is no need for proof  
In a world that's wired for sound  
The tongue becomes the mighty sword  
That battles the truth  
In a world that's wired for sound  
Comin' on like a tidal wave  
That washes through the brain--a state of mind  
No dispute when the noise is made  
And so it lets the blind lead the blind  
Lured by charisma to be swayed to believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Easier believing what is hard to get rid of than to try  
Never searching--just accepting  
Feeds the mind enough to get you by  
  
Scratching the surface yet to dig deeper down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Word of mouth is the counselor  
There is no need for proof  
In a world that's wired for sound  
The tongue becomes the mighty sword  
That battles the truth  
In a world that's wired for sound  
Wisdom from the sacred page  
Is turned and ignored  
In a world that's wired for sound  
  
[Chorus]

You are holy (you are holy)  
You are mighty (you are mighty)  
You are worthy (you are worthy)  
Worthy of praise (worthy of praise)  
I will follow (I will follow)  
I will listen (I will listen)  
I will love you (I will love You)  
All of my days (all of my days)  
  
Chorus:  
I will sing to  
And worship  
The King who is worthy  
I will love and adore Him  
And I will bow down before Him  
And I will sing to and worship the King who is worthy  
And I will love and adore him  
And I will bow down before Him  
You're my prince of peace  
And I will live my life for You  
  
(Girls behind guys:)  
You are Lord of Lords  
You are King of Kings  
You are mighty God  
Lord of everything  
  
You are Emmanuel  
Lord of great I am  
Noble Prince of peace  
Who is the Lamb  
  
You're the saving God  
You're my saving grace  
You will reign forever  
You are ancient of days  
  
You're alpha, omega, beginning and end  
You're my savior, messiah, redeemer, and friend  
  
(Both:)  
You are my prince of peace and I will live my life for you.  
  
You are holy (you are holy)  
You are mighty (you are mighty)  
You are worthy (you are worthy)  
Worthy of praise (worthy of praise)  
I will follow (I will follow)  
I will listen (I will listen)  
I will love you (I will love You)  
All of my days (all of my days)  
  
Chorus X2

Words:Deborah D. Smith  
Music: Michael W. Smith  
  
Made a friend last night, or you thought you did  
Had a drink, had a talk, took a drive  
Shared the night, gave up a part of your soul  
Now she's gone and you're a little less alive.  
Shake it off, never let your feelings begin  
But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in.  
  
Chorus:  
Yes, you really need a saviour  
Somehow you've known it all along  
Yes, you really need a saviour  
You know you've heard it for so long  
Yes, You really need a saviour  
Someone to come and lead you on  
You need a saviour  
You need a saviour  
It's time  
  
Told yourself today just for your own sake  
What was lost wouldn't cost anyway  
Life's a one night stand, this time you'll win  
The up and down, life-long game that you play.  
  
Shake it off, never let your feelings begin  
But your defenses are down and the fear is closing in.  
  
Chorus

You're Alright  
You take a look inside  
But you don't like what you see  
And so you choose to look away  
It doesn't coincide  
With how you'd like to be  
And each glimpse of hope can easily fade  
  
[Chorus:]  
Down on your confidence  
It's a fight that won't let go  
(But) you've got to realize  
That you're alright  
('Cause) under your rubble  
Lies a heart the Father holds  
And when you see your life  
through his eyes  
You're alright  
  
To learn how He loves you  
Is to learn to love yourself  
To live the life He's livin' in you  
(And) what others think of you  
Could never measure to the wealth  
Of what he's paid and given to you  
  
[Chorus]
