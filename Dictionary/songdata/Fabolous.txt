[Chorus:]  
'cause now I ain't wit cha, know that I miss ya, some how I carry on  
I can still picture, when I was wit cha like you was never gone  
I remember the good times, all of the bad times  
I dedicate this song, to my niggas laid out, til my niggas lay down  
Can Ya Hear Me, I know you hear me  
  
[Fabolous]  
Now we was once two niggas of the same kind  
Quick to holla at a bitch with the same lines  
Quick to draw on a nigga with the same nines  
But at the same time we was on some different shit  
'cause you was with a bitch that I beg to differ wit  
I told you sniff a bit and you could get a whif of it  
But you kept a closed nose when it came to those hoes  
And I'm your nigga so I tried to smell em wrong for ya  
Wasn't there to take the fault for ya, But if you hear me  
I dedicate this song for ya, He was setup in a stick up  
By a girl he used to pick up on the upper west side  
I used to help him chop a brick up, They found him in his pickup  
Pants down and dick up, leaning with one in his head  
And one in his chest, One of the best at this husslin' shit  
But his downfall was that he put his trust in a bitch and it's fucked up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fabolous]  
I remember selling three bricks of raw powder  
Turn my man into a star in 24 hours  
He didn't care spent the money in like 4 hours  
On a Benz with like 400 and Horsepower  
And a chain that had christ on it, a rollie with a lot of Ice on it  
A pinky ring with a price on it, when he come around  
Its likely that he blunted  
With a pretty lady in them Nike's that you wanted  
It's well know he kept it on his hip like a cell phone  
If you speak with him you can pick up on his jail tone  
He used to say he wasn't going back without blowing back  
And now I'm black I wouldn't put it past him  
The D's would Harass him, til he finally blacked out  
They told my nigga to freeze, but he still backed out  
Shots fired 'til his trigger finger got tired  
All the newspapers said was 'Another Nigga Dead'  
And it's fucked up  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fabolous]  
You can catch me in a cherry red 8-50 nice ass  
Great titties, face pretty everybody know that she date smitty  
A big time dealer that's doing a state biddin  
Who did more than his share of dirt in the world  
Enough to make a nigga think about hurtin' his girl  
So he used to tell his queen to stay to the castle  
Away from the hassle to the day that he pass through  
There's some enemies he might have who may want to blast you  
She stayed for a few years, that's until a few pairs  
Convinced her to come and hang out around New Year's  
It's been awhile, you can see it in her smile  
And she ran into her man's Co-Defendant in the trial  
Who started going on about how he moving on  
About running with them same niggas Smitty had warned about  
She slid off told her girl, she had to drop her kid off  
They found her in the parking lot, somebody blew her lid off  
And it's fucked up  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Baby girl  
You know my situation  
And sometimes I know you get impatient  
But you don't put to on a show to get patience  
Take it to court and go through litigations  
And I respect ya gangsta  
Treat you like a princess  
And put something on your neck to thank ya  
She's my pinch hitter  
When the starting lineup ain't playing right  
I come off the bench wit her  
It might sound like I'm gassing ya  
But it took time to get from the back seat to the passenger  
We been creeping and sneaking  
Just to keep it from leaking  
We so deep in our freaking  
That we don't sleep on the weekend  
Wifey  
A little bit uptight  
Wondering why he coming home in the middle of the night  
It'll be alright if y'all bump heads it'll be a fight  
But I said it'll be alright  
  
[Chorus]  
I really want to be with you (be with you)  
But I gotta be real with you (real with you)  
I can't leave you alone (lone)  
And I know I'm living wrong  
But I can't let ya go  
Your the one I want in my life (want in my life)  
Already got a wife (got a wife)  
Can't leave you alone (lone)  
And I know I'm living wrong  
But I can't let ya go  
  
You ain't ever step out of line  
Or get out a pocket  
So I made sure canary sent out your locket  
To protect you, I'll get out and cock it  
And you know the barrel of my gun is big enough to spit out a rocket  
Oh, you gonna play dumb if cops do come through  
I gotta keep the top up if my drop do come through  
But I know the boutiques and the shops you run through  
So I cop her one, and cop you one too  
You always get a daily page, weekly ring  
Plus you ain't too shy to do them freaky things  
I ain't gotta put a band on your finger  
I worry about you telling the whole world I'm your new Allen Springer  
At first you were something I denied  
Something I would slide  
Just do something in the ride  
But shorty  
There's something that you provide  
Cause the entree ain't as good without something on the side  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Uh oh, I might be leaving the earth soon  
My girl gonna kill me if she smells the scent of your perfume  
Its gonna be a clip towards if I go back  
With stains of your lip gloss on my throwback  
She won't care if I'm a platinum rapper  
If she catch me with an empty magnum wrapper  
So keep it on the down low call the carsely  
You seen what happened with Mr. Big and R. Kelly  
  
You know I get from you  
Anytime this chick is there for you  
Feelings I'm'ma share wit you  
Which makes it a Lil Mo clear for you  
  
[Chorus]

You know what?  
Everybody goes through some changes in life  
Some people change for the better, some poeple change for the worse  
But umm, some people need to make that change  
You know what I mean? Change is good sometimes. You know?  
  
Why would I change? I ain't never slide down a bad pole  
Even though I'm certified over plat's sold  
They say I'm different 'cause I ride in a plat. Rolls  
But every time, we gotta ride don't this cat roll?  
I never snitch, and go and hide in a rat hole  
And I ain't givin' you nothing besides what this gat hold  
No pride, I ain't that old  
Cut off a few, but kept a few girls I decide like I'm ??  
It probably don't seem like a struggle  
But I used to dream that this thug'll balance beams just to smuggle  
It's funny same girls that didn't seem like they'd love you  
Is beggin'for your autographs ands screamin' to hug you  
It's crazy, same dudes that seem like they thug you  
Is prayin' on your downfall, schemin' to mug you  
And people that didn't give a fuck, is dreamin' to bug you  
And goin through' extreme's just to plug you, who really changed?  
  
[Chorus:]  
This game ain't change me, so don't let it change you  
If you've been real with me, I'm still real with you  
If you got love for me, I still got love for you  
If you down for me, then I'm still down for you  
If you don't fuck with me, then I don't fuck with you  
If you ain't cool with me, then I ain't cool with you  
If you won't ride with me, then I won't ride for you  
This game ain't change me, don't let it change you  
  
[Verse 2]  
Why would I change? I didn't step out of Superman's phone booth  
To remind where I'm from, I look at my own tooth  
I'm speakin' the known truth  
I ain't been living the same, since I moved under Silvia Rone's roof  
Why would I feel like I'm a stranger?  
And why should I feel like I'm in danger?  
And I'm grindin' 'till I'm right  
Whether it's on the streets, or online tryna climb sites  
I ain't blind from the limelite,  
I had my mind and my rhymes right, and signed when the time's right  
People shouldn't be hateful, they should be grateful  
But fuck it, I guess I gotta keep my three eight full  
I'm playin, the game, like I'm, supposed  
Stayin, the same, like I'm, supposed  
Ghetto Fab in da house, hip hop hustler  
One million customers, and I still bust at ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Why would I change when I get green like the Incredible Hulk?  
I've chilled with the richest people to the ghettoest folks  
Known a few ?? and met a few locs  
Made a few comments, and said a few jokes  
But it's gettin' me sick, someone prescribe me some medicine  
Before the fame, the vibe was way better then  
Some have even became rivals instead of friends  
Only two become liable for settlements  
I grew up watchin the  
Now they hate to see a nigga drivin' the better Benz  
That's why the clubs be, deprivin' to let us in  
They know the family bring knives and barettas in  
I'm thankful for being allowed, fans for being the crowd  
How could my head be in the clouds?  
It's strange, what the fame'll do  
But you know what? The only one who seen the change from the fame is you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm the same nigga man  
Same nigga, that ridin' with you  
Niggas that's fuckin' with you  
I'm still fuckin' with you niggas  
The same nigga, these hoe's ain't like  
Now they on my dick right? Haha... shit is crazy  
Don't let this game change you nigga...

[Fabolous:]  
Uh yeah  
I'm back (thats right)  
Ghetto Fuckin' Fab niggas  
Street Family  
Desert Storm  
Get it on  
  
[Verse: Fabolous]  
I slide through in the name of the streets  
In the Range with the feets  
With TV screens in the frames of the seats  
I'm a pimp that slides into dames that I meet  
I rather just slide slugs in the chambers of heat  
I'm the reason other rookies in the game couldn't eat  
I'm the player Ly put in the game as a cheat  
Ya'll just tryin' to slide in the game in my cleats  
Ya'll could never be a ghetto superstar like me  
Whats the matter you confused?  
I ain't flattered or amused  
I don't know who put 'em in or what batteries they use  
But I got a clip for the slugs fatter than a fuse  
The rat tat tatta from the Uz  
That tell you  
Nobody do it sooner than son  
And he walk around with stones that look like the moon and the sun  
You know its real when another artist's street teams comin'  
Up to me askin' me when Street Dreams comin' nigga

uh, it's the d-d-d-d d-d-d-d d-d-d-d-d-d-damn ha-ha yea  
  
[Chorus]  
Damn-it's the way he grabs on himself when he gettin closer to them girls be
like  
Damn-it's the wife beater wish you were in the droptop cruisin hoes like  
Damn-I can't blame em' if he wasn't mine shit i would try and claim him,  
'Cause he's so fly and i'm so fly and you'll fool  
yourself if you try to deny him  
  
I'm nothin like them other brothers  
I got no choice but to slut her  
'Cause I'm in a 10-6 with the vase up that look somethin like a nutta butta
dutta dutta  
Mami you'll be in saint tropez  
  
Ridin jet skis and mopeds  
Powderin like dope heads  
Paparazzi snappin pictures they must thin you J.Lopez(BIATCH!!!)  
(Ha-ha)lets roast some spinach  
  
find a club and just post up in it  
what you mean are we there yet,I got lear jets that get to the westcoast in
minutes  
(ha-ha)I'm smoother than white vanilla fudge  
with white vanilla studs  
  
'Cause if they witnessed how I'm killin em out here these just might go tell
the judge  
(I rest my case)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
you could be prancin through ghettos  
in a pair of fendi's or pants and stillettos  
all you gotta do is swallow some kids like that witch did in Hansel and Gretel  
who's as handsome as ghetto  
  
this mans earings look transparent  
and my mtchell and s throwbacks be so old they could be somebodys grandparents  
I want the type of money athletes consume  
I have to assume  
  
I'm no fool,but I'm so cool,when i walk in feels like there's a draft in the
room  
(oooh)I'm so sick i drive em reverse fast  
call me a nurse fast  
shorty just lay back in the made back it'll make you feel like you sittin in
first class  
(Relax)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
They ask for it  
so i put TV's in the headrest and the dashboard  
and you gotta catch it on tape 'cause when the truck stops rims still look
like they on fast forward  
i'm sippin liquor the color of smurf's skin as long as the earth spins  
  
and you'll get sea sick,'cause my waves be thick enough for them cali dudes to
surf in  
(cowabunga)ya low ridin denims

and um I'm not braggin,but just imagine that you could even fuck with a nigga
like me  
(BIATCH!!!)  
  
[Chorus]

Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool  
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch  
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out.  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move  
Shorty pop a pill, pop that pussy, bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move  
The nfl must think I'm a damn fool  
Every time I touch down, I bust a dance move  
They use to have a movement, now they can't move  
Used to be on that glizzy like van couv  
Bout' to make em'? Move, L. A to st. Lou  
Say you got them toys, that santa story just ain't true  
Say you get this money, I'm no snitch I can't tell  
Call me mc Hammer, name a bitch that I ain't nail  
Can't touch this, you know that you can't touch this  
All black jewelry, now that shit do it justice  
Stand back while I bust this, you look like you does this  
Come and rub my hair girl, teach me how to Douglas.  
  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, like a damn fool  
Do the money dance, hundred racks a watch  
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move  
Shorty pop a pill, pop that pussy, bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move.

And before I leave, I'll peace out  
Let me see that camel, 3 times  
Slight work though, nightwork though, my girl don't  
Y'all girl go where my girl go and you her alone.

Pair of Nikes like one to ten  
It was hustle time and y'all walked it out  
When the money right, y'all runnin' man  
Pullin up the whole?  
Geechin' out with no cataract  
If you could understand what this watch cost  
You would understand why I try and adapt  
Me and him cannot shake hands, why trap when I'm a free man?  
You so a loss, you a robot, who done told y'all niggas to break dance?  
  
Hundred grand, tell em' bring em' out  
Pop a bottle, pop a tag and bust a dance move  
Bust a dance move, bust a dance move

[Fabolous (talking):]  
I don't got time for all this  
Just fast forward to the part where he start killing shit  
Yeah like right here  
Yeah (yeah)  
Yeah (yeah)  
  
[Fabolous:]  
Tough times don't last but tough people do  
I father n-ggas the way wayne and puff reproduce  
Lil rap bastards  
Running round with your snapback caps backwards  
Should be in rap caskets  
Who you think showed them the go hard with stunting  
And who you think showed 'em that those broads was nothing  
And who you think showed 'em that those cars was something  
And when fathers day came I got no card or nothing  
So I ain't out here trying to expose frauds for nothing  
And I ain't out here pulling these hoes cards for nothing  
They was bitches on deck y'all, made 'em queens  
Watching sports with a chick that got ball player dreams (swish)  
I'm watching these dogs play with my old bones  
I feel like n-ggas done found one of my old phones  
We in the house, y'all looking to hold loans  
And when the market was up, you wouldn't have sold homes  
So this the foreclosure of the wannabe  
If you can't be yourself, then who you gonna be?  
Dad to your swag, your style was like a son to me  
Your stylist got thank yous, you never sent one to me  
Lets pray for 'em  
Y'all repeat this one with me  
"now I lay me down to sleep, I pray for those who run with me  
If I die before I wake, arrest the girl I brung with me  
I give the Lord my swag to take whenever God is done with me"  
  
[Hook:]  
I be saying to myself as I put on da gloves  
It hurts when you gotta kill a n-gga you love [x4]  
  
[Paul Cain:]  
Yeah  
It's painful when bestfriends become ya enemies  
And you finding out that they not who they pretend to be (wow)  
The whole time you conspired to put an end to me  
And I'm still trying to show this n-gga love, silly me  
So I might she'd tears as I put on my gloves  
But I won't show emotions when I fill him with slugs  
Cause n-ggas die everyday here  
And you can get hit picking ya seed up from daycare  
N-ggas don't play fair  
That's why I'm straightforward, f-ck being all discrete  
If I can knock 'em off quick, f-ck beefing all for weeks  
So we was up late night hunting, y'all was sleep  
Cause we the wolves hiding in clothes, y'all the sheep  
Who taught ya the game, who showed y'all the streets?  
And who bought 'em them things they sold y'all for cheap?  
And who came up the bill when them hoes called police?  
Now you fronting so I gotta expose y'all to see  
Ungrateful motherf-cker, who fed you when you was hurting? (me)  
Whenever drama came up, who was putting the work in? (me)  
I was spitting live on hot 9  
You was still rehearsing  
Already my son and this was before I met you in person  
So no matter how many colorful fake chains you purchase  
Like that bullshit you wearing  
You're always gonna b worthless  
You just spit it, I lived it  
Who's really writing the verses  
Lose put em in the casket who you think driving the hearses  
  
[Hook]

Chorus  
For not being who you claim  
You get found guilty

Niggas fan of my instagram  
Beggin me for their bitch back  
Sendin treats to my B M  
Tryin to hack my email  
Niggas wisperin to themselves  
All huddled up like females  
Your bitch about to be detailed

She choked up like Sprewell

Ridin around wit that Houston rocket  
Keep all that of that Jeremy lin shit in yo pocket  
Chorus 2x  
Slim Thug

Then I got that photo porche  
Bout to switch it up for the summa  
Thinkin bout that electric hummer  
Strapped up got extra armor  
In case a hatin nigga wanna play  
Everythang I rep a 100  
You could check my resume  
They don't make em like me no more  
They don't make a miss t no more  
I don't see too many G's

Lets get back to that real shit  
That Pac BIG that UGk kinda trill shit  
East West and the South  
If you see a fake nigga point em out (point em out)  
Chorus

[Intro]  
Live from the 702, y'all know what this is  
Ta-ha, thank God it's Friday  
Felt it was only right  
In case you ain't think I could do it again  
Oh, I'm a do it again  
That Brooklyn flow, nigga, ha  
  
[Hook]  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up (Oh)  
Throw they hands up (Oh)  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up (Yeah)  
Throw they hands up  
  
[Verse 1]  
You know how your boy come through on a Friday  
I'm a smooth operator like Sade  
I'll put you in your place like valet  
But they ain't really about nothin' like Wale  
Yeah, I ain't talkin' 'bout no album  
Time to turn up, I ain't talkin' 'bout no volume  
Crazy up in here, I ain't talkin' 'bout asylums  
You ain't talkin' income, they walkin' outs they outcome  
You ex on a nigga, I ain't talkin' bout no Malcolm  
Bird from Atlanta, I ain't talkin' 'bout no falcons  
No 'Julio' Jones or 'Roddy' White  
But she could catch it like them if her body tight  
If she walkin', lose her naughties, right  
If she stretch it like Pilates, right  
If she ride it like Ducati bikes  
But you ain't fuckin' everybody, right?  
You ain't out here bein' thotty, right?  
I mean, I see a lot of thots whenever I'm in the club  
I play my cards right, grab a dime in the club  
Sippin' Ace of Spade, got my nine in the club  
Cause niggas be tryin' to jack a diamonds in clubs  
See, you know how I be, posted up on IG  
Get under they skin like IV  
Check a Internet thug down by IP  
He ain't carry guns, all he carry was ID  
And, see, now a nigga bitchin' up  
Talkin' quick, in your face, now the story switchin' up  
How they gon' pray for your downfall, then wish they up?  
  
[Bridge]  
1 a.m., on my way to the club  
2 a.m., it was goin' up  
3 a.m., bad bitches with us  
4 a.m., now they leavin' with us  
5 a.m., at the after hours  
6 a.m., now we at the house  
6:15, I be diggin' her out  
7:15, Uber in route  
8 a.m., ESPN  
1 a.m., I'm gon' do it again  
We gon', we gon', we gon' do it again  
  
[Verse 2]  
How the fuck you gon' talk about emcees on my heels  
When all I see is Timb trees on my heels?  
New black Spur, them Bs on the wheels  
Pull up anywhere, Tim D. in your grill  
Don't come at me on some, 'She still my girl'  
I'm rich, boy, I throw some Ds in your girl  
All I be givin' is some G to your girl  
Dick in a box from me to your girl  
So, you got a flow, that's cool with me  
I hear the freestyles, that's cool with me  
I see your little cars, little jewelries  
But none of y'all motherfuckers can fool with me  
You know that funeral flow spit eulogies  
You tryin' to fool a Gs, I'm tryin' to fool a G  
Put some gas in the game, few jewels for me  
You tryin' to trick us with a fake chain, foolery  
I just hit two mil on the Instagram  
I should post two mil on the Instagram  
Get this on if you ever go against the fam  
I sit on thrones, I don't sit on benches, fan  
Fuck the snakes, I'm ridin' with Kane  
When I bring that Dodge Vipe out, python piped out  
The wave is mine, I never wiped out  
If you was countin', you would have less to type out  
Get your money up, hustlin', grindin' sowin', finessin'  
Fuck that, everybody, come on  
  
[Hook]  
Throw they hands up  
Throw they hands up  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Outro]  
Y'all know what it is, world-famous DJ Clue  
Desert Storm, that kid Loso  
Bar for bar, best in the game, nigga  
I said it, uh-huh, live from the 712  
That street fam  
Throw they hands up

Fabolous,  
Funk flex, volume 4, niggas, c'mon...  
  
Yo, it's gettin' hard to dodge the women, but I'm still pitchin' hard white  
Balls faster than Roger Clemens  
Y'all know the kid with the "O"s that's as large as linens, when it comes to  
Selling trees--I'm as large as Timberland  
My lawyer got my charges slimin', he said the only way you going upstate, if  
Its along with women  
Pull out the garage like Gremlins, a rockford fos. System in it, that'll have  
The projects tremblin'  
Yall know nothin' bout lettin' a few sprays go off, yall only reach for your  
Hip when your 2-way goes off  
Shots'll fly by your head, your tupee blow off, I aint Crip, I'm just a  
Blue-grey show-off,  
Ghetto Fab, I more than rap for my bucks, keep two nines on me like Warren  
Sapp from the Bucs'  
The word I'm ballin', be flowin' til my jet shakes, and I keep chicks in my  
Lap--throwin' me head fakes  
Nigga, I walk around with them grands you stackin', and me and Flex don't  
Roll unless they Andrew Jacksons  
It's Brooklyn by me, the crook that I be, y'all even look or eye me, y'all  
Gettin' hooked to an I. V., mutherfuckers

Ha, ha, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Uh-huh-uh, uh, uh, uh-huh-uh  
Uh, uh, uh-huh-uh, uh, uh  
  
Mida, allow me to introduce myself, I'm known as Faboloso  
When it's time to slide, I'm known to grab the most hoes  
When I climb inside, they known to grab me close though  
(Yeah)  
When it's time to ride, I'm known to grab the toast though  
  
By the expression on these hotties grill  
(Uh huh)  
I can tell that wanna holla at somebody real  
(What up?)  
And I'm usually looking for somebody skilled  
(Yeah)  
Enough to make a nigga scream, ayayayo  
  
Niggas get mad 'cause I may slay they hoe  
But I don't wanna let these ak strays go  
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten me  
Besides, what I need wit another case fightin' me  
  
Nigga what I need is a ounce of good chronic  
(Yeah)  
Unbelievable amounts of hypnotic  
(Yeah)  
A shorty wit a ass that bounce like hydraulics  
(Yeah)  
And a nigga is straighter than six o' clock  
(Yeah)

Hey my nigga do me a favor. (what's that my nigga?)  
If u happen to bump into the streets  
Can you please tell him I'm back? (oh okay I'll do that)  
I appreciate that (my nigga)  
  
[Repeat x4]  
Na nana na nana nana na  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
I take it in  
I blow it out  
On the courthouse steps after they throw it out  
Bentley waiting by the curb I spur it out  
Doors don't open they self the chauffeur get out  
My exhale made anything a foggy blur  
I make my way through the reporters and photographers  
I take my lady's hand I shake my attorney's  
Slide in the back seat and let's begin this journey  
Told the driver hold off before we pushed out  
I let my window down and out comes a kush cloud  
Any last words?  
Justice has been served  
Now back to the streets that's what the hustlers deserve  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
I ain't lose a step  
I ain't miss a beat  
Thugs have emotions we miss the streets  
We kiss the heat  
We love the block  
We rubber band the money we black glove the glock  
I'm screamin' free at last free at last  
She used to send me pictures so I could see that ass  
That's real talk that's a real bitch  
Fly as I left the minx still fit  
They know my name but in case they didn't know so  
Appear in a casket courtesy of loso  
So you should have your shit packed  
I'm a need ya to not be here when I get back  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
  
Hey hey hey hey  
Aye daddy's home after a long day  
I'm from the hood I came a long way  
But I ain't goin' back I'm just visitin'  
I hear the streets talkin' I'm just listenin'  
If they ain't talkin' money I'm out my business then  
If that ain't what it is then what is it then?  
I'm out here grizzyin' swizzyin'  
It's me bitches sittin' in a phantom  
Got the streets back but I didn't pay the ransom  
My father who fathered you treat you like my grandson  
I came back for it like I left it nigga  
You try me you get more than a efa f it nigga  
  
Well alright okay  
I've been gone and away  
For too long a mistake  
But right now I feel awake  
I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (just like I'm back)  
Said I'm feeling like I'm back (feel like I'm back)

[Fabolous]  
Yo, I'm such a sight to see I turn a hater to a tourist  
The way I order Rose, I turn a waiter to a flourist  
Ferrari Lifestyle, that mean I'm living fast  
On the road to riches you don't slow down  
You give it gas  
25 is what they couldn't see us living past  
We was broke just once  
Someone give us cash  
Obama on the wrist, presidential Rollie  
Beverly Hills coppin', I aint Axel Foley  
I'm just a young n-gga moving like a Californian  
Word to proposition 19 in California  
I go from 0-60, a couple seconds  
She go from sober to tipsy and gettin' naked  
Me and Game the '010 Crockett and Tubbs  
Trey said he gon' meet us on the block of the club  
You heard Jerome, but instead of a Benzo  
Get rid of your Friends-oh to ride in this Enzo  
  
[Chorus:]

Tell the haters I'm sorry  
I'm passing them on the rise

Yeah  
Fabolous  
Brooklyn  
How real is that?  
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S-  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
The games over I'm fed  
Hop out the Range Rover with led  
Inf on it so I won't aim over ya head  
Ya'll niggas that give my name over to feds  
I dump slugs in ya pull ya chain over ya head  
I could hire trained soldiers instead  
Cause I rather flip shit call a dame over for head  
Sip gin 'tiil I wake with hang overs in bed  
F-A-B-O-L-O-U-S-  
The skinny hard fellow  
That brainwashed ghettos  
With nickels of crack the size of marshmellows  
Cops heard this heard that  
I come through where I purchased birds at  
Fur this fur that  
Let me find out you givin' words to the Dees  
I push ya top back like  
Going to Guadalupe just to splurge a few gees  
Ya'll want birds and hoochies  
I want birds and cuties  
Guess I'm a lucky guy  
All I stay is ducky high  
Next day in the Rover tryin' to suck me dry  
Throw 20s on me truck me bye  
Unless they crack the dash they ain't tryin' to hold me suck  
These thighs motherfucker  
  
[Fabolous:]  
Fabolous  
Get it right  
Brooklyn  
Clumminati  
Yeah

Feel like I'm Big Meech  
When I be cashing out  
Holding my bottles up  
Champaign splashing out  
We all got rooms nobody crash the couch  
More K's at the crib than a Kardashian house  
No Brian Pumper jewels just large links  
A lot of ice in 'em I'm talking large drinks  
Lets see what the Audemar thinks  
My necklace make chicks Nicki Minaj blink  
There are no challengers F what the Dodge think  
I'm riding in the... my garage stinks  
Cocunut Ciroc, coco-loso  
Pretty boy swag never coke my nose though  
Got your baby momma eating off a lead plates  
It mean the World to her, to me it's just a cheap date  
Plenty fish in the sea and I keep bait  
You're a broke rollerblader, cheapskate!  
My jeep plate say "Tune in to the game"  
Competition killer, funeral's the name  
Listen up son, I'm immune to all the lame  
If I fathered your style, put a Jr. to your name  
I searched the whole planet, there's no comp on Earth  
Sky blue J's (Jordan's), look like I stomped a smurf  
  
I said life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass now lets toast to when we didn't have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!  
I see haters in passing, yeah they 'round  
I be on the way up, they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk sh-t like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Won't be on Craigslist, lifestyle A-list  
On my way to Vegas I part playlist  
Yeah it's just another page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me  
My only job, consistent and persistent  
I go so hard my assistants need assistance  
I'm living mine hands on get the feel of it  
Life's a b-tch you might wanna get familair with  
  
[Verse From Fabolous "Bring Death To Em"]  
This the flow that put haters on their deathbed  
And make the chicks blow the whistle give me rev head  
Somebody call 911 like 'clef said  
'Fore my man's n 'em black out, Meth Red!  
The newspaper say young rapper left dead  
The only suspect they have is young funeral  
And when you see him  
He might be on his goony proud  
So you put him up in the air George Clooney style  
Slow motion for me so just slim juvenile  
Don't sh-t move a dude can't move his bowels  
Catch it like Larry Fitzgerald  
Kurt Warner bullets coming out the 5ths bureau  
Baby I'mma make it, my sh-ts thorough  
You shootin blanks your sh-ts durrough  
The competi... can't hold hold me  
But first lay in a box and cross your hands for me  
Fan base killer blame your loss of fans on me  
I triple what you see's like I'm Ross' man homie (Triple C)  
Dudes get to New York like loso's dead Tony  
You pick the place everybody cross the land for me  
Keep it real, I can't endorse or stand phoney's  
'Less we arm wrestle don't force my hand homie  
These YSL's cost a grand only  
My white girl bought that Porsche Cayenne for me  
Sweet, sweet like Georgia peaches  
School of heart, I get brain from gorgeous teachers  
Funeral in the house, no mortgage either  
Any competition he see the boy just ethers  
I can't feel my face this that Boston George reefer  
You lie if you say I aint hotter than August weether  
I mean weather!  
You can't see me, I mean ever!  
Ever ever, Andre 3 G  
This is me G, Gucci print G-G  
Clean ice neck full of frozen Fiji  
Been in the game long as Mario, Luigi  
No Juvenile, Wayne, Turk or B.G.  
I'm still Hot Boyz but it's stutter gang jack  
You bang right the first time they don't bang back  
You's can't ball like me they quickly meer in H.O.R.S.E  
I bring death to em, no hearing loss!  
Nice.  
[End]

You are now tuned in to W.F.A.B radio  
  
[Fabolous]  
Yo  
Baby Girl where you at ?  
  
[Lil Mo]  
Right here  
Right here  
right here baby  
Here's another one  
  
[Fabolous]  
You need to holla at somebody real such as myself  
Won't nobody do as much as myself  
And its so real ill hop out and get the dutches myself  
For a pretty girl as such as yaself  
'cause ima busy man I don't see too much for myself  
And sometimes it be hard to get in touch with myself  
But I, make the time when I have to  
Learn to take my time and be careful when dealing wit women  
There's some who be willing and skimming  
And dive in to relationships 'cause I got a million to swim in  
They'll throw it to you faster than schilling and clemens  
But feelings ain't the only thing that you can catch now  
Some throw lawyers that you hoping they fetch thous  
Others pass diseases that you can catch now  
But in my minutes so lone I think about this crazy world  
And.. I don't want to live in it alone  
Come on  
  
[Chorus: Lil Mo]  
Ill give you all my love  
And you can always trust  
My loyalty, honesty, and security (and i'll never)  
Ill never leave (no, no, no)  
Can none of these other chicks fuck wit me  
So holla at somebody real (cause i)  
'cause I'm so real  
  
[Fabolous]  
(real love) I'm searching for a real love like j blige in 92  
but I pray I will find you  
And say whether the storm will leave the gray skies behind you  
The fake may try to blind you  
That's why I stay fly like I do  
And no I can trust everybody that I say hi and bye to  
First I need a girl that may die as my boo  
Then I may try the I do's  
But, I refuse to be trick  
Or used by a chick  
Who gets amusement of kicks  
Out of abusing my dick  
When its real I'm all in it  
But I don't want the scars of love that you get when you fall in it  
(no) before it didn't matter who  
Now I look for some with a little attitude  
I could chitter chatter to, good looking  
But witty and compatible  
Long hair wit a fatty too  
And that'll do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Lil Mo]  
No I'm not trying to pressure you  
But my loves to incredible  
For to waste  
In front of your face  
Then I give you something you can feel  
To let you know your hollering at somebody real  
  
[Fabolous]  
I need to holla at somebody real could that be you  
The feelings that I feel could that be true  
Most cats lay where the hood rats be boo  
But I'm the kinda cat that strays away  
That's til somebody real sways my way  
Then I might spend some days always  
On a Asia bay  
Eating food made the Cajun way  
And sippin ga lil saki  
Blowing a lil brocoli  
But this world is full of fluzi's  
And bullshit usually  
I pull I'm choosy  
And on this joint and at this point  
I know I need to holla at somebody real  
For real  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Fabolous the one from the menatti mix  
Known to have more kicks than karate flicks  
Slim nigga in a big body six  
Wit enough dough and pull to Gotti fixed  
If I wasn't rappin I'd have a???  
Down south in a town you never heard before  
Dealin wit weight Columbians would murder for  
??? Cats I keep burnin for furthermore  
I'm the nigga every freak press be in a sleek S  
That's gon need week rest after greekfest  
Jump in private jets just to sneak west  
Bet these calico shots rip through ya weak flesh  
  
[Chorus:]  
Niggas want it  
Now they get it  
Bitches on it

Sip lots of cherry 'Ze in a hot chevy 'Le  
I know's a few niggas that plot to bury J  
Wanna scar my face put a shot in my derrier  
What you gon do when we send shots from every way  
We got perion while y'all got perrier  
I strut past in diamonds that could cut glass  
Wit dime bitches that'll make a nigga nut fast  
Now I gotta fiend bout to throw some chrome on a quarter  
Cop a crown and put stones on a border  
Smoke the trees now that's grown underwater  
Still keep 9's that'll put ya bones out of order

Chicks givin sarges and crucial head for

Wit a fancy chick we pay to pet kiss  
Fuck studs I'm bout to throw bagettes in my ear  
And be getting head from brunettes in a lear  
If you ain't talkin money I don't wanna chit chat  
Throwin partys in Jamaica when I hit plat  
Receivin chips thugs catch cases for  
Make bitches beat me til my waist is sore  
Sport come through nigga like checks on the first

Before things get blown out of proportion (chill)  
You know me I ain't grown out of the flossin'  
I'm still chromed out in the Porsche and  
Sick stones out in the cross and  
Before I known bout an endorsement

Then the folks phoned out to enforcement  
Man gettin the case thrown I was exhausted  
So now I just lay back  
Maybach relax

Double Header hos they play back to back  
And this hip hop they spray back on tracks

R.i.p to the competition  
Split these niggas to the white meat

So hearing that any nigga out cook me  
Is suspect as R. Kelly with girl scout cookies  
When you talking to a pro watch ya mouth rookie  
Go in ya shit have ya teeth playin' mouth hookie  
Nice, you niggas must of heard me wrong.  
I blame them horses when I turn that Porsche turby on (vrrm)  
My engine gettin' his Kentucky derby on,  
Seats is brunette paint is dirty blond  
Speaking of dirty blond's  
Say hi to curvy Don Fergie John  
With the body movement of a turbion  
I just watch her,  
It's been a hectic year  
So I sit and get fried  
Call the weed electric chair  
But y'all on death row, one request left  
You looking for ya girl oh she just left  
Her and my dick just became B.F.F's  
Then I threw her out like jazzy J. E.F.F  
I'm raw dawg, y'all safe sex  
You dicks belong in latex not tape decks  
You can't see me  
Neither can the flunkies under you  
My shit bananas, like a monkey number two  
I'm bigger than that  
More like guerrilla though  
Nick name funeral got that from this killer flow.  
Er'thing still a go, my pockets be extra fat  
Big money on deck like A Rods next to bat  
Shit  
Somebody contact the tabloids  
I'm a big deal like a contract from bad boy  
Yeah, it's all good baby baby  
My swag plays a big part so it's all gravy  
We hit the club like Nino in the C.M.B  
Pretty mixed bitch I just call ha P.M.B  
Watch ya step baby gettin' out that G.M.C  
You bust yo ass girl we both gon' be on T.M.Z  
Don't be shy let them cameras expose you  
The worst that can happen is I Amber Rose you  
People running up like damn I knows you  
Hey ain't you? Yeah I am that bitch  
Six feet deep nigga, yeah I am that ditch.  
Throw it in the bag in a recession, I am that rich  
I'm under close watch niggas got binoculars  
I ain't what's poppin' bitch I'm what's popular  
If I'm the one to go at, niggas what's stopping ya  
I call my gun Nadia, and I be finger poppin' her  
Keep that bitch cummin' like blaka blaka  
Go to ya head like a shot a vodka  
Rock a sick fit call a doctor potna'  
You think I had a Gucci deal Waka Flocka  
Yeah I am too fucking raw (what you say?)  
Yeah you heard me I am too fucking raw  
(Raw)

[Chorus]  
When you grow up in my hood  
Help don't show up in my hood  
Gang signs go up in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
Feel like I'm trapped in my hood  
Young kids get clapped in my hood  
That's why I'm strapped in my hood, just 'cause you in..my..hood  
In..my..hood, in my hood, in my hood  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
I'm always close to..  
Feeling like a corner stander, stoop sitter, or hallway post-er  
No matter where I go it's always 'posed to, feel just like I'm (in my hood)  
Cops drive in it every 5 minutes, look at your faces, pat your waists'  
Try to find the stash where the gats and base is, I can't say that they racist  
But I know.. it ain't the same in they town  
And as fucked up as it may sound (in my hood)  
It's 2 ways to make it happen off the streets  
Balling on the courts or rapping off the beats  
You hear the shells tappin' off the 'crete, when they clappin' off the heat  
Then the yellow tape's trappin off the street  
But that's the way we was raised  
Preying to God, hoping that he keep us out the way of them strays  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
They drink 'til the cups dry, eat 'til the plate's clean  
Niggaz be in state greens 'fore they turn 18  
'Round here you never let the beef slide twice  
Everybody raised on 4 wings and beef fried rice  
Them mothers are getting younger today  
Got one by the hand, one in the stroller and one on the way  
We don't have role models  
But we got them handguns that hold hollows (in my hood)  
Ain't no diplomas or degrees  
But you can get high from the aroma of the trees (in my hood)  
I know it like navigation, and fuck having patience  
I'ma get mine, you better get yours, 'cause everyday is a struggle  
And One-Time ride through everyday just to bug you  
That's how it is, 'cause your rights be wrong  
And everybody got a white T on, when you're in..my..hood  
  
[Chorus]  
[Verse 3: Fab]  
We try to make the most of what we got  
You either been hit, or been close to gettin shot (in my hood)  
Any nigga that boast be getting got  
And dopeheads fiend to get a dose of what we got  
And young niggaz be like they slow  
But you give them a blunt..bet they roll the weed like a pro  
If you trick it's not a problem it gets you laid  
But if you stick without a condom, it gets you AIDS  
No Sesame Street, kids watch BET  
Look up to niggaz that don't got a GED  
I know a dude with the deadbeat tag  
Kids don't got diapers but he ridin' in the red G-Wag'  
In the hood, you and your beef is sure to bump heads  
And everybody grew up sleepin on bunk beds  
They telling me to vote..and I would  
If it made a change in my hood..mu'fucka.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Fab talks 'til the end]

[Fabolous]  
Shawty you autumn time cool  
But they don't see your beauty f-ck all them blind fools  
Body so mean that it's border line cruel  
Work 8 to 3, then from 4 to 9 school  
Dominican girl who knows more than mongul  
She say lets stay in the room and order Dom Cruz  
It sounds like a plan  
'Cause girl once I got you by your limbs  
That guy who spot you at the gym can't put it down like I can  
I wanna take you places further than where your feet walk  
Why scream when your voice is better for sweet talk  
A little accent, cute ass lisp  
First a toast is said then a flute glass kiss  
I like it when you whip yo hair, but that's Willow fault  
I speak body language, f-ck pillow talk  
We can wake up 'round noon on a saturday  
And make a f-ckin movie, now that's a matinee  
But on the weekdays I wanna be yo' wake up call  
Kiss yo' face before you put that make up all over it  
You go from gettin' ready at the bathroom sink to gettin' bent over it  
Then it's over with  
Now you rushin' to work, ipod touchin' yo purse  
Ima let you go but not without touchin' it first  
When you think 'bout it later you blush and you smirk  
Your co-workers thinkin' you got a crush on the clerk  
You always talk about yo boss, about how much of a jerk he is  
But tell me baby does he touch you and flirt?  
'Cause that's how such and such get hurt  
And lame ass n-ggas start bringin' crutches to work  
I know you got it girl, I trust in your work  
Ladies is pimps too, go 'head brush off the dirt  
I be here when you get off with dutches and purp  
I want you after dinner, your such a dessert  
The night is lookin' sweet the only thing I'm tryna bite is yo physique  
And in most cases with you  
Only thing I wanna fight is gettin sleep 'cause I eat and go to sleep  
You know I is in the sheets, niceeeee  
Don't touch it, let my eyes do the undressin'  
Play Usher and take ya back to confessions  
I wanna crush ya' nevermind the tongue wrestlin'  
Wont rush ya, one question  
  
[Hook:]  
Can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Sun risin' while you yawnin'  
Shawty, can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Shawty, can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Shawty, can I Hit it in the mornin'  
Shawty sun risin' while you yawnin'a

[Sean Paul]  
All you need to know is the vibe round' here we built and instill it  
Sean Paul alongside  
Fabolous, you done know we bust  
Telling them again, hey!  
Girl run away the guy that wants to "vibe kill" it  
She say a only the "topper" youth and "dapper" youth she want (to) win it  
Fabolous!  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Lets get it ta' poppin' ma, its a little before 1  
And I'm yellin' out hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, yo  
I can tell by the ring in the middle of ya tongue  
You're the kinda girl that has a little bit more fun  
I'm literally yours hun  
Cause' I never seen a ass so big with a waist as little as yours hun  
And by the expressions on them hotties grills  
I know they want to holla at somebody real  
And I'm usually lookin' for somebody skilled  
Enough to make a nigga say aye aye aye yo niggas get mad 'cause I may slay
they hoe  
But I don't want to let the a.k. spray so  
Stop face fightin' me, like ya face frighten' me  
I do this every year so I ain't never scared  
I do this everywhere and you ain't never there  
They sayin' this everywhere, how could you never hear  
  
[Chorus: Sean Paul]  
If you want to roll with the thugs tonight  
Lights, camera, action can you feel the hype  
Hit cruise control blazed Kryptonite  
Well its alright, baby its alright  
If you want to live up and free your life  
Come through let we kick it 'til a morning light  
If you want to roll with tha thugs tonight  
Well its alright, baby its alright  
  
[Verse 2: Sean Paul]  
So get with it, we want (to) hit it, we nah quit it  
And I like tha way you body set and how your clothes fit it  
I want you give me some of it because minute by minute  
Temperature it all a rise because you thighs and all you hips, style  
You shockin' it, you a rock it, you a kill it  
And a one thing the Dutty Paul want to predict  
Say by tha end of tha night you will be chillen' with tha click  
Flossin' it, money we tossin' it  
'Cause we a tha Boss in it  
We naw ease up...We ain't stallin', grab the girls all in  
That's my true callin'  
Ya'll freeze up.. We be flowin' it,  
Your girl knowin' it And that's why she's showin' it.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3: Fabolous]  
Over here the liquor is light blue, the chronic is light green  
They wearin' the right shoe, they put on the tight jeans  
They bringin' me right through', I walk with a slight lean  
My style excites you, I know what that might mean  
Aye, I'ma freaky scorpio  
Yo, tryna' leave with your skio  
Aye, but its mandatory tho'  
Yo' after me let shorey go  
  
But that's another story tho'  
But please don't try to bring us to the Maury show  
How cool is he?  
You don't know a fool who be crazy enough to fool with me  
You'd rather swim in a pool of pee  
Then see the one you love in the vehicle with me  
Aye  
Yo  
But the vibe is right, the girls is up to par  
We gon', drink it tonight and earl it up tomorrow  
It goes  
  
[Chorus]

[Hook]  
It's g-a-n-g-s-t-a  
That's how it be and it's gon' say (Y'all know whoooooooo)  
That's how it be when you see me  
That's how it be in NYC (Y'all know whoooooooo)  
If it's me it's got to be  
If it's me it's got to be  
G-a-n-g-s-t-a (Y'all know whoooooooo)  
  
[Verse One]  
I'm still living la vida loca  
Where hoes sell prices on weed or coke-a  
For the hustlers, for the customers, trust the buzz  
It's have you makin' one of the sounds that Busta does (woo HAH!)  
They love me just because  
I'm in the gallardo, laughing like Ricky Ricardo (Ha ha ha ha)  
With the 4-pounder, pretty gangsta nigga  
I'm the co-founder, I know the difference between pimps and hoe-hounders  
I can tell when they ain't learn to lean  
They gold cups missing stones, turning green  
I roll up wrist in chrome, burning green like what's good  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse Two]  
God was in a good mood, on the day he made me  
I'm from the projects, it's the way it made me  
And I wouldn't change it for nothing  
I stay on point, that's ''cause I know the danger of stuntin'  
But the aim is like I'll be at the ranges or somethin'  
It takes a gangsta, to know a gangsta  
That's why we look at you like a stranger or somethin'  
''cause we can tell by the body language you frontin'  
And it take a little more than lettin' ya pants sag  
Ya sand bag, tryna jump on the band wag  
I'll put the red dot on you like a Japan flag  
You need some high heels and a handbag  
  
[Hook]  
  
[Verse Three]  
I'm in the ten minutes to nine, leanin' on 'em  
Like I'm ten minutes behind, fuck a hundred shots  
Give me a .40 cal wit' ten in it, I'm fine  
Just spray, and shit'll get you ten minute of shine  
Keep a friend in it, that's ten cented for mine  
Keep the rims in it, that spin in it for mine  
Can't see him in it, I been tinted up mine  
But you know a nigga look oh so gangsta  
Oh no thank ya, I earned my key  
My name'll get you fucked up, and burners tee  
That's gangsta love, from the heart  
Yo I told y'all from the start  
And now (y'all know whoooooooo)  
Keep it G'd up, I can't slow down, these creep's speed up  
Cali bringin' peeps and weed up  
I'm coming through with a bunch of girls that'll deep a seed up  
(It's a gangsta party)

This is the last time, I know I'm 'bout to drive you crazy

Try to walk but I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go  
Damn, here we go again, I just came back, girl, don't make me go again  
She say you been in the streets, you was with that hoe again  
Money wrapped in rubber bands, what you sellin' blow again  
How she got you holdin' guns but you call that hoe your friend  
You ain't posed to bring her home, what do you show her in?  
I was like show her in, never that, oh no  
Anybody in the streets know that that's a no, no  
So know I would never ever  
(Ever, ever)  
Baby, I'm a g, yeah, that's right the seventh letter  
See one thing about the streets, I know where the heffer at  
And I bet she always be exactly where I left her at  
But you know we had a bond, no ring, no paper  
And I don't hear this shit when I bring home paper  
My ears to the streets, what you gonna tell us?  
You keep talkin' down, girl, you sound like you jealous  
This is the last time, I know I'm bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more  
Try to walk but I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go  
Hi honey, I'm home  
She looked at me and said it's five somethin' in the morn  
You smell like you been drinkin', the vibe from me this strong  
I said, baby, that's cologne, she said, nigga, that's patron  
If you wanna keep with them bad habits that's fine  
You think I'm with it then you out your rabid ass mind  
They'll say tricks are for kids, most chicks woulda slid  
But who ain't miss a visit through the six that you did  
I'll be damned if I do another six with some kids  
Who only see they daddy in them flicks on the fridge  
Them niggas that you think are inna mix with ya shit  
They the same reason Michael Vick's doin' biz  
I say hold up, I met you, I was thuggin' back then  
And you was ridin' with me holdin' on a Mack 10  
But that was back when, you ain't give a what  
Now you standin' here tellin' me to give her up  
This is the last time, I know I'm bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more, try to walk  
But I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go  
Hold on, baby please, you can't leave now, no, John baby, please  
We gonna get you to a hospital as quickly as possible  
Life is full of obstacles, we gonna get you through this one  
You looked me in my eye when you told me you was done  
I played her for a fool but I guess I was the foolish one  
Member when she told me that she know how this dream ends  
Late night phone call from one of my close friends  
Tellin' you that we are rushin' to the er  
By this time tomorrow we was posed to be in dr  
Me blowin' a cigar, you sippin' a tini  
I told her pack her bags and don't forget her bikini  
Then just like houdini, it all disappeared  
The escape to paradise, didn't end like this I swear  
Sorry baby girl, I tried the best I could  
If I can't be in the streets I guess heavens just as good  
This is the last time, I know I'm bout to drive you crazy  
Last time but I gotta see my baby  
I know I swore that I'd never break your heart no more, try to walk  
But I just can't leave her alone, girl  
She keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
I try to leave her alone but she keep callin' me  
(Callin' me)  
And I gotta go  

[Verse 1: Fab]  
You finally got some off time  
It's usually Sports Center for the fourth time  
Tonight you came out of yours and I took off mine  
Now we finally playing catch, got some back and forth time  
Tossing pillows, passing blunts, caught a buzz  
First time you gave me head was everything I thought it was gonna be  
You ain't got one degree  
But you'll get a ph. D for that thing you've done to me  
  
[?] Tugging dungaree  
I wanted you under me  
Wanted to spread them legs like you number 23  
Maybe you wasn't ready  
Maybe its under key  
And it's some for them, and it ain't none for me  
So we cuddle for a while, talk what you want to be  
Some things we had in common and movies you want to see  
He made her run to me, you played with one of these  
Pretty young girls, ain't no telling what she gonna be  
  
If she was my girl, might sound sprung of me  
I'd give her everything like she had a gun to me  
Busy man, but for you I'm free  
Just counting down the days 'til the next time we....  
  
[Hook: Ryan Leslie and Fab]  
  
Lay down...... Lay down... Lay down  
I can hear you now, lay down  
I can hear you now, lay down  
(Let that body talk) x2  
  
Talk to me now, listen  
  
[Verse 2: Fab]  
  
Your scent light up the truck soon as you hopped in it  
Easily number one, no matter who the top 10 is  
In that passenger, no reason for gassing ya  
Girl you ain't killing 'em, baby it's a massacre  
Black curly hair, smile with a pearly glare  
I can take you around the globe, I'm sure the world will stare  
But tonight we in the city, like J. Lo and Diddy  
Back in 99, that bad boy with pretty  
A rainy night, the type that make you change your flight  
But we still fly  
Ain't nothing plain about us, right?  
We came to get a bite, blue ribbon for two  
And I ain't clumsy but I'm so tripping off you  
  
Had sushi for the first time, she tried the king  
California tempura, oh you trying things  
  
I'm your waiter, I hope you like what I'm trying to bring  
All you gotta do is the two words Ryan sing  
Lay down, lay down  
Hey, girl I know my way round  
Coming down, H-town  
Ass up, face down  
Guess we on our way now  
I know you can't stay 'round  
She climbed on top and said look nigga...  
  
[Hook: Ryan Leslie and Fab]  
Lay down...... Lay down... Lay down  
I can hear you now, lay down  
I can hear you now, lay down  
(let that body talk) x2

Close eye-lids.

Body suits, body tight.  
Yeah, I clean up nice.  
Catch me on a tidy night,  
Might be Gucci'd down to the tidy whites.  
OK it's loso,  
Everybody knows so.  
My son is the heir to the thrown,  
Prince Joso.  
So daddy need money,  
Mummy need new truies.  
Baby needs new shoes,  
Preferably the new Louis.  
The swaggers in his jeans,  
He was born fly.  
Them Philly bitches say the ball keep his jaunt fly.  
Then Reggie Kush shot us up in Californi.

Hush little lame niggas don't say a word,

Put a dick in your ear and fuck what you heard.  
She tried to pull my fly south,  
I ain't want the bird.  
Because I been killin' these hoes,  
These niggas just drop dead.  
In the drop head,  
All we do is bop heads.  
To the side,  
Like busta in the Pepsi add.  
With my Columbiana mamma,  
Yep she bad. (she bad)  
She in the latest shoe that Giuseppe had.  
Blow game like the late dizzy Gillespie had.  
That's some good jaw.  
Pop quiz,  
Good score.  
She call her pussy Medellin,  
That good raw.  
For you little cheap fucks,  
Hood whores.  
You niggas soft in the middle,  
Call them hood smalls.  
Everybody on the block going cuckoo.  
Phantom doors open like the clock that goes cuckoo.  
Birds poppin' out.  
Sittin' on the hood,  
Check my bird droppings out.  
I'm shittin' on the hood.  
Sleepin' time, niggas.  
The hand that rocks the cradle for you nursery rhyme niggas.

Sicker than yo average  
(Sicker than ya average)  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 1]  
Ha ha, sicker than yo average  
Oh you think you hot  
I'll come through quicker than a maverick  
Shut ya heat down, you'll quickly be embarrassed  
Come through where you live, flick it up like Dallas  
Stick to living savage, I'll stick to living lavish  
Picking up a bad bitch, the chick look like my ad-libs (niiice)  
She calling me Fab Pitt, you can be my Jolie  
Swing big sticks, shorty you can be my goalie  
You ask too many questions, yo, you can be the police  
You know what time it is girl, you can see my Rolie  
My car like a hospital, with the windows tinted cause  
You can't see me but you know a sick nigga in it right  
  
[Hook]  
(Ha, sicker than ya average)

[Red Cafe - Verse 2]  
Sicker than yo average  
Euro gang crazy, I'm in the sickest fabrics  
High every day like I'm living in the attic  
Psycho, psycho, my living room padded  
I'm sicker than magic, oh  
Stuntin' in the sickest air max, oh  
Now I'm finna pose for the flashes, hoe  
Still I put it down in the mattress  
So make that girl the opposite of Go-Go  
Go, go, dippin' from behind doing the sickest blue jays and I aint talking
Toronto  
Sicker than yo average, there he go, the finisher  
Sick hot, 200 degrees, check the temperature  
  
[Hook]

[Intro - Fabolous]  
I wanna be your number 1 fan, but from the stage  
Know it's hard to see way up in the stands  
  
I understand, but damn [x2]  
  
Wishing I could be that one man, but you juggle  
Way too many of them with one hand  
  
I understand, but damn [x2]  
  
[Verse 1 - fabolous]  
Yea, slow down baby, let me be your yellow light  
The way we met was wrong, let me say hello right  
You need a mellow night, a break from this ghetto life  
The way I roll make them haters wanna yellow dice  
She say what matters is that you keep them stilettos nice  
And when you slap this ass, it shake like jello, right?  
Well alright, roll them cigarellos tight  
I nicknamed her bape chicken and yellow rice  
Pretty brown skin, long blonde hair  
And she know they talking but she never gon' care  
Cause when you balling trash-talk is what you gon' hear  
I can't imagine what a fall upon lebron's ear  
Always been the girl that didn't have to wait in line  
Niggas buy her watches just for making time  
Fake say "give it up" never had to ask  
They call her the stick up girl that never wore a mask  
Baby, ain't you tired of life in this fast lane?  
Packing luggage, rushing, trying to catch that last plane?  
There's some dudes who take pride in trying to gas dames  
The same dudes will see her and give they last name  
Funny how I became the apple of her eye  
The game went south and I'm a rapper from ny  
Don't get me wrong: lil mama love "trap or die"  
But through it all she kept her watch on the dapper guy  
And fell in love with a 2009 verse  
She said before we met, I fucked her in her mind first  
We crossed paths, a mixture of karma and luck  
I walked in strong, mentally palming my nuts  
I got em swarming and stuck, she calm in the cut  
You know me? I can spot a swan from a duck  
My approach? Smoother than an armani tux  
The diamonds going off, like the alarm on a truck  
The small talk, warming her up, she palming her cup  
She told me that I make her laugh and I'm charming as fuck  
But for now she had to go, the chat just quickly changed  
She was chilling, now she leaving, I mean that was kinda strange  
Asked "can we meet again?" she said "that can be arranged"  
And I'm sure we both have phone numbers that can be exchanged  
We did, she slid, that'd a be explained  
But for now she hopped into a platinum-colored range  
  
[Trey songz]  
See baby, see you gotta get ur mind right while there's still time left.  
You know life, wanting vip sections and flight confirmations  
Jumpin start to star, got ur own constellation  
I aint tryna say dat you, shit, maybe I am  
Never follow ur heart  
Sure to lose your mind... If you neva follow ur heart...  
  
[Bridge:]  
You need to slow down... (yes baby you need to slow down) [x2]  
Slow down...  
You need to slow down  
You need to slow... You need to slow... You need to slow down  
You need to slow...  
Baby for real you need to slow it on... Slow it on down

[Fabolous]  
It goes however I wanted to  
These bitches never say can't  
I just call it angel, she look like heaven in pants  
Big house, couple rides  
Call that shit Neverland Ranch  
Tre Pounds, shoot fast, call that shit Kevin Durant  
You n-ggers beneath me  
Now go get f-cking stomped son  
No I run this city I am Brooklyn's Nucky Thompson  
If they make me go in  
I'ma go right away  
Mny fly ass can't be stopped no flight delay  
Gotta a crew of bad bitches  
Call em the nice girls  
Yo b-tches look scary  
But she aint no spice girl  
It's 9am when you clock, you're an office worker  
It's big Bens in my pocket I'm a rothsberger  
Coconut ciroc and pineapple, easy order  
Now I got this chick showing me what Yeezy taught her (Amber Rose?)  
Welcome to the funeral pay respect  
Me and your girl, unibrow, may connect wait a sec  
Let it breath...  
  
Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha  
  
It's goes getting more money  
They come with more problems  
I used to be Mac'ing but now I'm Steve Jobbin' man  
See you got 2 choices  
You can stay broke or grind  
Life is a bitch, and I'm just tryna Oprah mine  
Gettin' more money, it comes with more problems  
Man used to be Mac'ing but now I'm Steve Jobbin'man  
Got 2 choices  
You can stay broke or grind  
Life is a bitch, and I'm just tryna Oprah mine  
  
[Paul Cain]  
Always been a squeezer, I've been on the hollow n-ggas  
Alwyas been a leader no twitter, I don't follow n-ggas  
F-ck glass, drink Rose out the bottle n-gga  
I promised to keep it 1000 you know my motto n-gga  
Don't just talk it, be about it  
You talk it, but we about it  
We do it, you read about it  
Leave 'em don't speak about it  
We live it, you dream about it  
How could you even doubt it  
Couldn't get a quarter round here  
Unless we allowed it  
This is our city, our town, our turf  
We eatin' and y'all thirst  
Do shoot back, bomb first  
Get 'em gone first  
Let em fire, arms burst  
Regardless of size or status  
Stuff em in that long hearse  
I think I'm Malcolm X, Huey Newton  
Marcus Garvey, I'm surrounded by my army damn  
Damn, n-gga try and harm me  
F-ck what a hater think  
How could n-ggas try to rob me  
If I'm out in Abu Dhabi, ferrari's and Maserati's  
Fleets pulling up in Nobu's and Cipriani's  
Or that F1 race track, good look tryna find me  
Wherever I'm at, I'm smoking some Bob Marley  
7 star hotels, you can see the ocean from the lobby  
Riding in the goose, riding to the Goose  
Believe the great deal with stress  
I've been through the most  
Changed my whole way of thinking, got a new approach  
Fly private if it aint first class, I'm through with coach  
Street fam for life, this we all owe the los  
Whole gang bottles in the air  
I propose a toast  
We dun seen the World  
Partied with emirates  
We all come from nothing, always remember that  
So you should be thankful everytimeyou spend a stack  
For the all classy restaurants we ate dinners ate  
All the cars, audemars with the different straps  
But always strive for more, never be content with that  
No beginner rap, no number 1 contender jack  
Arnold Swarzenegger returns, Decembers back

[Verse 1]  
Yeah, F-A, be -O, L-O, you-S

You gotta love the way this playa be minglin  
If you don't tell yo man mama, I ain't sayin a thing and  
That nigga got you used to the H.N.O. Kingsten  
I'm fuckin limbos, lay on the wingfin  
  
By the way I be blingin, the pay that I bring in  
Mind spendin a day with the kingpin?  
Answer yo cell, all day it been ringin  
Tell that nigga, we on our way out to England  
  
Them hips and tips, the way they be swingin  
The way the be jinglin, letz stay til the spring and  
Know I thugged you out, the way that you drinkin  
And don't be scared cabby, the Yay I be slingin  
  
Ma, I'm where you want to be, if not  
We can hop in a lid and fly where you want to be  
Yea, you a G, the type that ryde with them cameraz  
Instead of the rearviews on the V, I know  
  
[Chrous] (Lil' Mo)  
I wonder if I take you home  
Would you still be my thug baby  
Because I need one tonight  
I wonder if I take you home  
Would you still be my thug baby  
Because I need one tonight  
  
[Verse 2]  
Allright, okay...  
You just gotta stay patient boo  
I'm a make sure to take you, where eva you dream a vacation to  
You can push the grey station through  
  
I'm a sit in the passanger, and rock PlayStation 2  
How da hell [unknown] been tweekin out  
How you been sneekin out, spent weekends out  
She'll be tired of trainin dat month  
  
You probably be fakin' like you came and you ain't even nut  
Miss I'll pipe you til you get a pain in yo gut  
The kid'll be responsible for changin yo struck  
Wherever you hurt, I'ma rub it down  
  
I be ready to smack it up, flip it in public now  
I know how to get you hot, I know how to hit yo spot  
If I take you home, I know how to keep you stylin  
I know how to keep you smilin if I take you home, let's go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Verse 3]  
I think it's just that ladies ???  
I'm in love with my red 6, and got a crush on a navy Caddy  
I like'em deepcut, bust, with crazy fatties  
They be wishin' I was just, they baby daddy  
  
I'm the one that make it real easy  
For you to just drop'em like he hot, like he Lil' Weezy  
I ain't goin' never make you feel sleezy  
And I'm a put the roof up on the drop if it feel breezy  
  
I love the way you smerk and giggle, jerk and wiggle  
Throw yo legs up while I work the middle  
Already told me how you strictly be witt'em  
Now I'm a show you so much cash, that you'll quickly forget'em  
  
I'm young, but know I'll have you in a bungalow  
Fillin' yo stomach wit Cris, yo lungz with dro  
I'll have you sprung fa sho  
It ain't goin' be no limit where yo tongue will go, ya heard me?  
  
[Chorus until fade]

[Hook:]  
That's not love  
That's not love  
That's not love  
  
[Lil Wayne - Verse 1]  
Snakes in the grass, so I stay in the pavement  
Survived the battle with animals and cavemen  
And dead animals and dead men  
I'm all in and my only friend is Amen  
Keep your mouth cosed, you wanna know why you die  
The answer's right under your nose  
Exposed to the street, in the game I don't cheat  
I just play my position, get mvp  
I get money, don't shit come free  
It's my life and I run it even when  
Keep my business in my pockets, don't wash with bleach  
And I never show my hand, not even to me  
See...  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 2]  
Say what's on your heart if you're real  
Cause the scars you can't see be the hardest to heal  
And I used to chase money, now I have it brought  
Cause you can only chase something that you haven't caught  
If there's a summertime in hell, it's not as hot  
You empty clip niggas aint got a shot  
  
These diamonds on my neck are an eyesore  
Now you decide if their to die for  
Advice to my haters, do what I say now  
Report to the nearest roof and take the fast way down  
Thought it was love, how foolish of us  
I do me, she do her, sometimes we do eachother  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Lil Wayne - Verse 3]  
Look, as the crooked World revolves  
Love spelt backwards is evol (evolve)  
And Evil spelt backwards is live or live  
And when death comes you better have lives to give  
I spit that real talk like knives to ribs  
And rats die ugly, die with kids  
These niggas is snitching and still living  
I hope my words are like razors to the bitches  
Niggas pretend like they actually in  
But when it go down they f-ck around and be them  
That blood look familiar when it's leaking  
If you scared, go see a Deacon nigga  
That aint love  
  
[Hook:]  
  
[Fabolous - Verse 4]  
Life is but a dream  
Aint always what it seems  
Meanwhile get your cake red velvet butter cream  
Raise your glass and lets toast to when we didn't have  
Hustle plus muscle equal success, I did the math!  
I see these haters in passing, yeah they 'round  
I be on the way up, they be on the way down  
Now I can sit and talk shit like Skip Bayless  
You looking for these shoes baby you can skip payless  
Lifestyle A-list, young black and famous  
Bunch of bad bitches in an Ipod playlist  
Just anothger page in my success story  
I make my worst enemies wish the best for me

I introduce you to the life  
You need the life, the life needs you  
Everything is nice  
  
Let me welcome you to my world  
Everything's in living color plus the fly girls  
On the way and gotta watch them with a keen eye  
Niggas ain't seen fly till they seen I  
Maybach cause I'm not a limousine guy  
Suit with the bow tie no bean pies  
The Laperle match well with these Feragamis  
Killer shoe game these are just a pair of hamies  
Mommy I get up like QB's  
Na, she ain't stepped in blood, those are Lou B's  
We don't follow, unless you lead us into VIP  
When they know your face, they don't need to see ID  
I can see the bottles coming from a mile away  
Sparklers on the top act like they don't know to stop (stop, stop)  
She fuck with niggas like Fabolous  
Cause to tell the truth, baby life's fabolous  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
Get your money right, you could be living that  
You could be living that, you could be living that  
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living fabulous  
  
I bow my head and I praise that  
We be there and back before the Rose's flat  
Picture me anywhere a clown stays at  
I don't think so, homey don't play that  
Everything is BOSS, like a Rick ad-lib  
Take it to house like it's Trick Dad Crib  
We hit Miami like a hurricane  
Shorty poolside, one piece Veroaine  
She the baddest bitch in them Jackie O shades  
Flabby beach mat, she don't give me no shade  
Hold the heat down, she don't even know Wade  
Nigga get smoked like cigarette tote  
I like her soft kiss and I dig her wet throat  
I love her booty bounce like cigarette boats  
And it won't quit  
She can't wear skinny jeans cause her ass don't fit  
Real shit  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
Get your money right, you can be living that  
You can be living that, you can be living that  
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living fabulous  
  
Got a rich bitch on the way  
That for real though, just like Wanda say  
She just wanna rock my world in the Wonder way  
I'm sitting at the airport like Andele  
Fist I saw the Luggy with the Louie monogram  
Then I saw my baby like a sonogram  
On the runway, just me and Bentley  
I open doors, you ain't gotta G the gent me  
I was thinking Knicks game, court side  
She put her hands in my pants, I let that thought slide  
We can get it on, but there's no leg room  
No water bed, just a boat with a bedroom  
Now you tell me who can top this  
Hey, laying on the deck topless  
Got two different dames, it's a Fabolous thing  
One white, one yellow, like Fabolous chain  
  
It's the fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
Get your money right, you could be living that  
You could be living that, you could be living that  
It's a fabulous life, oh I be living that  
Oh I be living that, oh I be living that  
How you living, what? How you living, what?  
How you living, oh I be living Fabolous

I am an illusion, really what you cannot see  
So picture me,

H, dot N dot I dot C  
We don't play when we roll, no Yahtzee  
And I hate you niggas, no Nazi  
But this the holocaust, rap genocide  
Ike Turner take that bitch slaps in the ride  
My shorty tellin' me, kill the competition boo  
And I be tellin' her there is no competition to (nice)  
There is no competition two  
It's good to wake up look in the mirror  
And the only competition is you  
And even that nigga ain't seein' me  
My reflection have a hard time bein' me  
So the tryna do me shit, it's time to dead it  
I'm what ya don't do, even if Simon said it  
I kill 'em with the shine, yea these black diamonds pretty  
And my watch is sick but I have no time for medics  
Black ice in the Ottomar, this is custom order bra  
First I call the jeweler up, then I call the coroner  
My car is foreigner, my bitch is from Florida  
I killed the pussy last night so now her man is mournin' her (damn)  
Good mornin' sir, I goodnight niggas  
Y'all on death row, I Suge Knight niggas  
Time to depart, I book flights nigga  
Whats up son, what it look like nigga  
Black dress, black suits  
Black shades, black boots  
Black truck, black coupe  
Guns blow, black flutes  
Black card, black jewels  
Black party bag  
Black Friday,  
Throw it in a body bag  
Black barbie,  
That's what I call my black braud  
African plug,  
That's what I call a black chord  
Get ya sharps get ya flats, that's the black keys  
Get it slick or get ya holes in ya black tees  
Black limos black town cars, black hearses  
Black register books, signed in black cursive  
Black tears, white tissues outta black purses  
That's procedure, when I'm sendin' back verses  
  
The wake

They call me funeral fab  
A.k.a. young funeral im killin these niggas  
Dram  
All these niggas is dead  
You look around they all dead  
Ha ha its street fam nigga  
Nice (nice, nice, nice)

I said... Fuck em all, muthafuck em all  
Ya'll done turned a good guy into a Chuckie doll  
I would've been your friend till the end bitch  
Guess there ain't no friends in this shit bidness  
Just a bunch of assholes in the shit bidness  
But they won't flush me down the toilet bowl without my tissue  
These bitches talk shit out the same mouth they kiss you  
These niggas kiss ass with the same mouth that diss you  
Eww, you niggas disgust me  
And they ain't talkin bout shit unless they discuss me  
Let's talk about how, I'm killin errything I touches  
Or how I walked in this game with no crutches  
No Diddy, No Dupri, No Dr. Dre  
No Cash Money from Baby and no rocs from Jay  
And I'm still here  
We still here  
What does this break dude?... It's still here  
And dude talk, concernin New York  
When I was runnin the city you was learnin to walk  
So I watched you niggas take they first steps  
And I was happy for ya, daddy was clappin for ya  
But, wasn't for me prolly wouldnt've happened for ya  
So I rest my case  
I'm a rappin lawyer  
That's unless you wanna talk bad bitches  
Section full of bridezillas, that's mad bitches  
No words, I describe em with letters best  
They pretty as can be, curvy as the letter "S"  
They keep it G, they sweet as T  
Look good in the passenger seat of V  
They ride double are, smell like double C  
The Bags are L. V., D, or a double G  
Fly as hell, shades wire cell  
On E, sippin P. J., high as hell  
And please don't even talk about swag  
I'm cool and collective  
A Fool with perspective  
I'm far from being typical my respect is reciprocal  
I already came up  
You still on the zipper pull  
And I would say my style is 5th Fab meets Brooklyn  
I keep the hood watchin, I got the streets lookin  
They watch what I do, so they know what to do  
Lil money never told big money what to do  
Money talks, if you speak guapanese  
A language better known if you gettin cheddar holmes  
If not get a loan, use that like Rosetta Stone  
And that way you can holla bout a dolla  
I hear em cryin broke, they holla like a toddler  
Come holla at yo gualla, don't holla at sovallas  
You'll end up down under tryna holla at Koalas  
I keep that nine on me, ala Iguodala  
We can get it jumpin like the drolics on Impala  
I feel like Neno lettin em rock wallas off the colla  
Somebody tell me something, What the fuck happened?  
Somebody talk to me, muthafuck rappin  
They infiltrated the game, but who let in the pookies?  
Kingpins is snitchin that shit is not lookey  
So fuck new friends unless they stay solo  
Cuz who gon' watch you back after you kill Manolo?  
Isn't it ironic Santana's own fella stabbed him  
The king of New York die while I yellow cabbed him  
No Carlito's way  
When I spot a hater drop him like a hot potatoe  
Youahead, got me later  
Yeah I keep it gangsta but I'm'ma do it my way  
The new day of the week is called My day  
So it's my say, Pass my K  
I'm thru talkin

I ain't in no rush  
I handle you niggas when I feel like it  
I just be chillin'

She bend it over, I will hike it  
Number one pick, got skills like it  
Heard she fucks with some ball player  
When I touch down I still spike it  
Know I got that check on me  
I'm not Nike but it feel like it  
At the game in them floor seats  
I ain't Spike but I feel like it  
We ain't friends, we don't chill like it  
You ain't my dog we don't bill like it  
My nigga no camera man

Where I'm from it ain't Iraq  
But swear to God it get real like it  
Got soldiers in the field like it  
'Bout mine, you get killed like it

I got bricks like constructions  
You want instructions?  
You niggas ain't built like me  
Competition ain't real like me  
I'm so sick, who ill like me?  
Two bricks in my suite  
So when I leave I bet them bitches still dyking  
Family good 'cause I feel like it  
I'm hood 'cause I feel like it  
Might not be your favorite artist  
But your favorite artist got a verse from me  
So they still like it  
Ain't nobody popping seals like me  
Codeine like a supplement  
If I make her cum it's a compliment  
Nigga fuck you, like a parking ticket  
Now I got 'caine, like a walking stick  
Shoot you for a argument  
Make all my bitches take all your bitches and play hide and get  
I'm getting rich 'cause I feel like it  
Take your girl 'cause I feel like it  
Cash her out, toss her up  
Wash her up that's the spin cycle  
And them niggas never did like it  
In the car and I got the title  
Grandma bought me a hand bible  
I bought me a hand rifle (Fire!)  
'Cause I feel like it  
All you niggas look recycled  
And I'm getting head in the car, while she's driving  
  
When I feel like it, kill these hoes when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, that's my bitch when I feel like it  
When I feel like it, kill these niggas when I feel like it  
Now I do this shit when I feel like it

New shit DJ Envy featuring Fabolous  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Niggas won't be happy 'till they got price tags on 'em  
Layin' in hospital beds with ice bags on 'em  
I'm comin' through in coupes with the nice mags on 'em  
Diamond chain with a Jesus Christ tag on 'em  
Maybe I'm just feelin' the Kush  
Everybodys against war but right now I'm feelin like Bush  
When you get money theres nothin' that you can't do on the Earth  
Its not a problem for niggas to plant you in the Earth  
Better walk with Uzes  
The talk is useless  
Don't try to spoon ya reason or fork excuses  
Cause I don't feed into the bullshit (nah nigga)  
Without a ten millimeter and full clip  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
[Verse 2: Fabolous]  
The kids too cool to let these young boys get the best of him  
The 4 fifth put 'em in one troy with the rest of 'em  
These niggas try to get they nose into my biz  
And get emotional cause they hos wanna try Spizz  
The shooters are beggin' me show who the guys is  
And when the cops find 'em they won't know who the guys is  
It ain't my fault that ya'll ain't comin' up yet  
But I'm probally responsible for makin' stomachs upset (WOW)  
My chain  
Give a nigga my brains  
When the coupe flow by  
Make a nigga throw drive  
And you fuckin' with a OG  
My new year's resoloution was to leave these suckas in the O three nigga  
  
[Chorus: Fabolous]  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly  
  
I come from the city of NY  
Section of Brooklyn known as Bedstuy  
Don't come around here and talk fly

[Verse 1: Fabolous]  
Sometimes I amaze, sometimes I disappoint  
Sometimes I blow this paper like it's just a joint  
Sometimes I look at change like it's just some coins  
Like shaq at the line, you prolly missed the point  
It's perspective, which angle you looking from?  
When you take a chance, ever wonder who you took it from?  
I'm from brooklyn son, got no problem taking nothing  
So I figured I could take nothing and make it something  
Tell 'em faking ass niggas they won't make it frontin  
Tell 'em girls lose they clothes and get to shaking somethin  
Purple weed, gold bottles now let's laker something  
Cause y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
  
[Hook: fabolous]  
Smoking on loud  
Swagga to the max  
Bad bitches holla  
I just holla back  
My money talks, I ain't even gotta tell 'em  
Even when I talk low, don't it sound like I'm yelling  
  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really  
  
[Verse 2: fabolous]  
Might be how I'm feeling mixed with what I'm drinking  
Got me on some shit, that might be what the stink is  
You might just be cool it might be what you thinking  
It might be something in her eye but to me, she's winking  
Listen before ya dumb ass say some stupid shit  
And have my dog laying on your house on some snoopy shit  
Ball player swag, that's what out the hoop and shit  
Two chicks that hanging with mr cooper shit  
Eat with me if you hungry dawg  
But then again how loyal is a hungry dawg?  
That's saying hunger make your dog eat you alive  
You either starve to death or you eat to survive  
  
[Hook: fabolous]  
Smoking on loud  
Swagga to the max  
Bad bitches holla  
I just holla back  
My money talks, I ain't even gotta tell 'em  
Even when I talk low, don't it sound like I'm yelling  
  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really  
  
[Verse 3: red cafe]  
Shakedown on sleep  
I'm getting to the money  
The way I'm counting sheep  
I be counting money  
Live from the roof  
Empire state  
Finna burn this bitch down  
Find the next fire escape  
I'm high so nothing ain't farfetched  
Out in houston with my rocket no...  
Fuck with that street fan  
Fuck with that loso  
Come to your city spend some tickets at the go-go  
Giving back to the hood be what I call it  
Smoke grand daddy kush  
I'm in orbit  
If they ain't with the family they weirdos  
  
[Hook: fabolous]  
Smoking all out  
Swagger to the max  
Bad bitches holla  
I just holla back  
My money talks I ain't even gotta tell 'em  
Even when I talk low don't it sound like I'm yelling  
  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really hear me though  
Y'all don't really y'all don't really y'all don't really
