On Valentine's I think of you  
It's just a poor excuse  
You suffer me in my mind  
Every single day, it's no use  
  
It seems like cool sexy stares  
But nothin's been ever said  
Just keeps goin' 'round my head  
  
I think I'm waiting for you  
I think I'm waiting for you  
  
You're more than a friend and almost a lover  
It feels so good, I can't help but wonder  
I keep thinking, ooo when'll you discover  
We've got the flame, I want the fire  
  
A-acting cool and casual  
Check in 6pm to say hey, every day  
We're edging closer to broken rules  
And getting carried away  
  
I imagine that you've heard  
Every hidden silent word  
And we'd take it that bit further  
(Take it that bit further)  
  
I think, I'm waiting for you  
I think I'm waiting for you  
  
You're more than a friend and almost a lover  
It feels so good I can't help but wonder  
I keep thinking, ooo  
(When you'll)  
Discover, we've got the flame, I want the fire  
  
It's getting closer to now or never  
(Getting closer)  
It's only us and it's clear  
(Ooh oh oh)  
I can feel it when we're together  
  
Ooh you're more than a friend and almost a lover  
It feels so good I can't help but wonder  
I keep thinking, ooo  
(When'll you)  
Discover  
  
Mmm  
We've got the flame  
We've got the flame  
We've got the flame  
I want the fire, I want the fire  
  
It feels so good I can't help but wonder  
I keep thinking ooo  
(When'll you)  
Discover  
  
We've got the flame, I want the fire  
I want the fire, I want the fire  
I want the fire  
  
Wonder, I want the fire  
I want the fire  
Discover, I want the fire  
  
Yeah-eah, oh oo  
Yeah-eah, oh oo  
Yeah-eah,  
  
We've got the flame  
I want the fire

Tears will fall  
It's better to have loved than not at all  
Or so they say...  
  
Always and Forever  
I don't regret a single day  
With you  
Always and Forever  
  
Tears will fall  
It's better to have loved than not at all  
Or so they say...  
  
Always and Forever  
I don't regret a single day  
With you  
Always and Forever  
  
Night and Day  
Say goodbye then slowly fade away  
Like lovers do  
  
Always and Forever  
There's a place within my heart  
I keep for you  
Oh I keep for you

Twenty-four hour sunset  
I got a tank of gas and  
All the things I can do  
When driving with you in my Aston  
It's a perfect chance  
For some romance  
With a little luck now baby  
We might get to start  
  
In my Aston Martin  
We might get started  
In my Aston Martin  
Let's go  
In my Aston Martin  
You can call me darling  
In my Aston Martin  
Let's go  
  
I love the records playing  
On a late night radio  
Just anticipating  
How much faster we can go  
  
It's a perfect chance  
For some romance  
Got my fingers crossed now baby  
That we get lost  
  
Way down by the sea  
Is where I wanna be  
Way down by the sea  
Is where I wanna be  
  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
(We might get started)  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
(We might get started)  
Way down by the sea  
(In my Aston Martin)  
Is where I wanna be  
(Let's go)

You, you are so beautiful  
  
It used to be, you and me  
Love like no other  
Our world around, could fall apart  
But we had each other  
Saw you walking, you were smiling  
And it hit me like the first time  
Feels like yesterday, has come and gone  
But nothing's changed, when I look at you  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful  
You're my eyes  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
Still hurts sometimes  
Love on the line  
But we said forever, yeah  
Sailing on, through the storms  
But we had together  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful  
And now I  
I just want you to know  
That after all this time  
You're still the one  
  
You, you are so beautiful  
You, you are so beautiful

Here we are in the dead of night  
Will you keep me warm and hold me tight  
  
All we have is until the dawn  
Let the night be long and ease the dawn  
  
I love you more than you'll ever know  
It hurts to see you go  
  
So darling sing me a lullaby  
Uh bittersweet goodbye  
  
Don't think about the future now  
These few hours  
Let the nighttime envelop us  
Take us under  
Bewitching spell, bewitching spell  
  
Here we are in the dead of night  
Won't see you past the morning light  
  
So Darling sing me a lullaby  
Bittersweet goodbye  
  
Remember me when you're away

(Verse)  
In the night alone I stay awake  
Even stars so bright, they fade away  
But we can't escape what we're made  
But it can wait, this heartbreak  
  
(Chorus)  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
  
(Verse 2)  
Every time, it's said to?  
No signs to tell us what to do  
But we can't escape what we're made  
But it can wait, this heartbreak  
  
(Chorus)  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
  
(Bridge)  
But we can't escape what we're made  
But it can wait, this heartbreak  
  
(Chorus)  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heartbreak, break break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break  
This heart (heart heart heart) break

Don't blame me just because I am bored,  
I'm needy I need to taste it all,  
Don't down me just because I am quiet,  
I'm thinking about it all.  
I'm helpless about the way of me,  
And I'm thinking,  
Thinking about it all,  
I'm sorting everything inside  
  
I'm looking into space,  
This time this void,  
I'm making my way  
Through the muddy minutes,  
The pull is in my muscle,  
The ache is in my bones,  
Its hard to be alone  
  
Breathe, breathe,  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
  
Breathe, breathe  
  
See through me when I put up a fight,  
I'd like you to see the things I hide,  
Go deeper than I will let you know,  
I'm frightened but I won't let it show,  
I'm helpless about the way of me,  
And I'm thinking,  
Thinking about it all,  
I'm sorting everything inside  
  
I'm looking into space,  
This time this void,  
I'm making my way  
Through the muddy minutes,  
The pull is in my muscle,  
The ache is in my bones,  
And it's hard to be alone  
  
Breathe, breathe,  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
It won't be long now  
  
Breathe, breathe  
  
Breathe, breathe,  
  
[Repeat: x12]  
It won't be long now

Bury me deep in love,  
Bury me deep in love  
Take me in, under your wing  
Bury me deep in love  
  
There's a chapel deep in a valley  
For travelling strangers in distress  
It's nestled among the ghosts of the pines  
Under the shadow of a precipice  
  
When a lonesome climbing figure  
Slips and loses grip  
Tumbles into a crevice  
To his icy mountain crypt  
  
Bury him deep in love, bury him deep in love  
Take him in, under your wing  
Bury him deep in love  
  
When the rock below is shaking  
The heart inside is quaking  
How long this cold dark night is taking  
Bury me deep in love  
  
Bury me deep in love, bury me deep in love  
Take me in, under your skin  
Bury me deep in love  
  
And the little congregation gathers,  
Prays for guidance from above  
They sing, "Hear our meditation,  
Lead us not into temptation  
But give us some kind of explanation  
Bury us deep in love"  
  
You may lose me on the east face  
You may lose me on the west  
I may be covered over in the night  
Bury me deep in your love yes  
  
Bury me deep in love. Bury me deep in love  
Take me in, hide me under your skin  
Bury me deep in love  
  
Bury me deep in love, darling bury me deep in your love  
Deeper and deeper. Deeper and deeper  
Bury me deep in love

Like it's suffering  
  
I have this feeling  
It is forever  
That forever is so close  
  
I hear you calling after midnight  
After all night like a Van Gogh  
  
So allelujah  
The feeling is going through her  
Like a food caught into her throat  
  
If I lose her  
I don't know what I would do  
You got my eye chasing off ghosts  
  
You got me here waiting for your love  
You got me here waiting for you  
You got me here waiting for your love  
You got me here waiting for you  
  
With all this nature  
They calling names so they know  
Yeah, they what they know  
  
I'm hearing voices  
Drowning out the noises  
  
So allelujah  
The feeling is going through her  
Like a food caught into her throat  
  
If I lose her  
I don't know what I would do  
You got my eye chasing off ghosts

Fragile seams  
I opened my too quick and all my dreams  
Were walking out I'd slowly  
Lost my fire  
With every single man a river cried  
  
I had no sensation  
Completely numb, left with no satisfaction  
I thought no-one could ever get me high again  
I swear, I was not looked  
  
Oh, waited so long  
I thought the real thing was a fake  
I thought it was a tool to break me down  
You proved me wrong again  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a place less place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
If love were a human it would know me  
In a lost space come and show me  
Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
Like chocolate  
  
Tastes so good  
My heart's been mended who'd have thought it would  
An empty bet and still I won the cash  
A man who I love and who  
Loves me back  
  
Oh, waited so long  
For love to heal me so I'd feel it  
Thought it wasn't breathing then you came  
You proved me wrong again  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a place less place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
If love were a human it would know me  
In a lost space come and show me  
Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
Like chocolate  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a place less place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
If love were a human it would know me  
In a lost space come and show me  
Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
  
Like chocolate come here  
Zoom in, catch the smile  
There's no doubt it's from you  
And I'm addicted to it now  
  
Just one look boy to melt me down  
Just one heart here to save me now  
Your candy kisses are sweet I know  
Hold me tight baby don't let go  
  
Just one look boy to melt me down  
Just one heart here to save me now  
Your candy kisses are sweet I know  
Hold me tight baby don't let go  
  
Just one look boy to melt me down  
Just one heart here to save me now  
Your candy kisses are sweet I know  
Hold me tight baby don't let go  
  
Just one look boy to melt me down  
Just one heart here to save me now  
Your candy kisses are sweet I know  
Hold me tight baby don't let go  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a placeless place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
If love were a human it would know me  
In a lost space come and show me  
Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
  
If love were liquid it would drown me  
In a place less place would find me  
In a heart shape come around me and then  
Melt me slowly down

Hold me and control me and then  
Melt me slowly down  
Like chocolate

C'mon, get down, c'mon  
  
This beat is so hypnotic  
Feels like it will be getting  
All of the people on it tonight  
  
I sense the situation  
And let the bass line do it  
And get a new creation for life  
  
City games, people doin' what they do  
Feel the change, through the night  
Slow it down, feelin' kind of a desire  
Got a sound for your loving  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
Now that the beat's chaotic  
It's best that we be getting  
A little wicked on it tonight  
  
So come a little closer  
So I can whisper to you  
That's got a twist of what I, I like  
  
City games, people doin' what they do  
Feel the change, through the night  
Slow it down, feeling kind of a desire  
Got a sound for your loving  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming 'round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
City games, people doin' what they do  
Feel the change, through the night  
Slow it down, feeling kind of a desire  
Got a sound for your loving  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming 'round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
My baby gets down when the tempo drops  
Never coming 'round 'till the music stops  
My baby gets down, baby loves the sound  
  
My baby gets down when the music's right  
I'm losing myself in the city lights  
My baby gets down, baby gets on down  
  
Baby, baby  
Baby, baby

We'll redesign  
Where we combine  
To be divine  
Love in us  
  
Give me the sign  
View these confines  
We start to shine  
Love in us  
  
Closer and closer  
And closer  
To you now  
Never enough  
  
Closer and closer  
You pull me  
Give me more  
Soft and slow  
  
We are breathing the same  
We are moving the same  
And we were  
And we are  
  
We're free-designed  
Become aligned  
We are combined  
Love in us  
  
Closer and closer  
And closer  
To you now  
Never enough  
  
Closer and closer  
You pull me  
Give me more  
Soft and slow

I stand in the distance  
I view from afar  
Should I offer some assistance?  
Should it matter who you are?  
  
[Chorus]  
We all get hurt by love  
And we all have our cross to bear  
But in the name of understanding now  
A problem should be shared  
  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
  
I can keep a secret  
And throw away the key  
But sometimes to release it  
Is to set our children free  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
  
Stick or twist  
The choice is yours  
Hit or miss  
What's mine is yours  
  
Stick or twist  
The choice is yours  
Hit or miss  
What's mine is yours  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me  
Confide in me

[Chorus:]  
Count the days till we're together  
(One-two-three)  
Though it feels like forever  
(We will be)  
Holding on to each other  
(You and me)  
You will be my only lover  
(Eternally)  
  
You made my day  
When a dozen red roses came my way  
Warmed up my heart  
'Cause I know you're thinking of me from afar  
  
Press a petal to my lips  
Feels like your kiss  
Don't you know that's what I miss  
To smell the sweet perfume  
Reminds me so much of you  
There's nothing else that I can do  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
It's been so long  
I know our two hearts are strong  
There's not a moment  
That my spirit isn't in it don't you know it  
  
Try to occupy my time  
Remember you're mine  
Talking to you on the line  
Try to get used to this  
But long distance loving is  
Leaving me to dream of your kiss  
  
[Chorus: Repeat 2X]  
  
When I'm feeling scared and lonely  
Wonder if I'm still your only  
Tell me now  
Soft and slowly  
It's gonna be alright  
You'll be by me side  
  
Press a petal to my lips  
Feels like your kiss  
Don't you know that's what I miss  
To smell the sweet perfume  
Reminds me so much of you  
There's nothing else that I can do  
  
[Chorus:]

Jump back, tell a friend  
Ooh, la, la, la  
Ooh, la, la, la  
Ooh, la, la, la  
I want a movie moment  
We're so in love it hurts  
And I'd be the main attraction  
Everybody's favorite girl  
Wanna be in Gucci dresses  
I know you like that style  
Symphony of stars to serenade us  
I'm giving you my smile  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
I'm gonna be here  
So cover me  
Run into you in slow motion  
Thunder claps and pouring rain  
The world is falling down around us  
We didn't notice anyway  
Wanna be in Gucci dresses  
I know you like that style  
Symphony of stars to serenade us  
I'm giving you my smile  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
I'm gonna be here  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
My love is for real  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Come on, come on, cover me baby  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
I'm gonna be here  
Cover me with kisses  
Sweet, sweet kisses  
Come on over and kiss me all over  
My love is for real  

Shed my skin since you came in,  
Where do you end and I begin?  
Awoke my senses yet you stopped time,  
You took me to a deeper high,  
The essence of my hopes and fears,  
Creation of my muddled dreams  
  
Cowboy Style,  
With a peaceful smile,  
You are from the temple  
Won't you stay a while  
  
Found my voice to have my say,  
You take me close to far away,  
And now I find and now I feel,  
The ordinary is surreal,  
Peace and terror all in one,  
My future life has just begun  
  
Cowboy style,  
With a peaceful smile,  
You are from the temple  
Won't you stay a while  
Won't you stay a while  
  
Won't you stay a while  
  
I am frightened I'm aroused,  
I'm enlightened to the now  
  
Cowboy style  
Cowboy style  
  
Cowboy style,  
With a peaceful smile,  
You are from the temple  
Won't you stay a while

Top down, get on the wheel  
Baby things are better when you just feel  
And you do you your own thing  
Ah, just let it swing

Oh no, the lights go green  
Time out, do you know what I mean?  
We're all on our own  
I ain't going home  
Out there I want to be  
No more bumper two bumper cars for me  
We're on the highway  
Put it on replay

If only you knew  
I shimmer for you  
Oh, the very feel of it  
I'm hooked on your line  
Under your spell  
Your love is king  
  
You color me gold  
And now that you know  
Baby, you've got all of me  
I'm hooked on your line  
You're under my skin  
I need your touch  
  
So why don't you thrill me  
Like you did before?  
Why don't you give me  
A little bit more?  
Why don't you call me  
Start hittin' me up, hittin' me up, hittin' me up?  
  
Give me your love  
You've got it all sown up  
And your beat's so very  
I could never get enough  
You've got the good stuff, good stuff  
  
[Chorus]  
Cupid boy, when we touch  
I'm in heaven in your arms  
Fire--the way you love  
Feels like Heaven in your arms  
Sky rocket to Mars  
Straight through to your heart  
Every time we touch  
I'm shooting the stars  
Cupid boy, when we touch  
I'm in Heaven  
  
I'm losing my grip  
Letting it slip  
Baby, I want all of you  
You're reeling me in  
Every time I give in  
I'm addicted  
  
So why don't you thrill me  
Like you did before?  
Why don't you give me  
A little bit more?  
Why don't you call me  
Start hittin' me up, hittin' me up, hittin' me up?  
  
Give me your love  
You got it all sown up  
And your beats so very  
I could never get enough, baby  
You got the good stuff, good stuff  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
Cupid Boy  
  
I could never get enough  
You've got the good stuff, good stuff  
  
[Chorus]

Good times bad times baby you're in trouble  
You stole my heart and you're given me up  
And we're not even friends so how can we be lovers  
I wanna know the truth  
'cause I've had enough  
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But your wasting your time  
'cause if you think you've got me right just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now you've lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you  
  
Had your chance but baby you blew it  
You never loved me and baby you knew it  
And every time that you messed with my mind  
I still believed in you  
  
'cause I've had enough  
I'm sick and tired of pleasing you  
Have I had your love  
Is that the best you can do  
You can dream of changing my mind  
But you're way out of line  
'cause if you think you've got me  
Boy just watch me  
  
On the dance floor  
Gonna lose it in the music  
On the dance floor  
Got my body gonna use it  
On the dance floor  
The best that you never had but now you've lost me  
So come on watch me getting over you

You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen  
  
Friday night and the lights are low  
Looking out for the place to go  
Where they play the right music, getting in the swing  
You come in to look for a King  
Anybody could be that guy  
Night is young and the music's high  
With a bit of rock music, everything is fine  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance...  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen  
  
You're a teaser, you turn 'em on  
Leave them burning and then you're gone  
Looking out for another, anyone will do  
You're in the mood for a dance  
And when you get the chance...  
  
You are the Dancing Queen, young and sweet, only seventeen  
Dancing Queen, feel the beat from the tambourine  
You can dance, you can jive, having the time of your life  
See that girl, watch that scene, dig in the Dancing Queen

Surely this can't be heaven  
Though it feels like I died  
I guess it's just goodbye then  
There's nowhere left to hide  
Can't you see you have the power  
  
To make or break my day  
I'm getting weaker by the hour  
All the time you stay away  
  
I'm so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own I've lost my way  
I never dream't that it could hurt like this, boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game  
  
So where do I go from here  
What do I have to do  
Something to make you realize  
Just how I feel for you  
  
Don't you see you have the power  
To make or break my day  
I'm getting weaker by the hour  
Do you hear me when I say  
  
I'm so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own I've lost my way  
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this, boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game  
  
But the feeling still remains  
And the embers feed the flame  
How I hope you feel the same  
So I love will grow again  
  
It's only you see you have the power  
To make or break my day  
I'm getting weaker by the hour  
Can't you hear me say  
I can't face the world today  
  
I'm so in alone I feel so lonely  
Here on my own I've lost my way  
I never dreamt that it could hurt like this, boy  
Lost in the absence of your precious kiss  
Why do I feel this pain  
Loves just a dangerous game

When you're sad and when you're lonely  
And you haven't got a friend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And all that you held sacred  
Falls down and does not mend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
When you're standing on the crossroad  
That you cannot comprehend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And all your dreams have vanished  
And you don't know what's up the bend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
When the storm clouds gather round you  
And heavy rains descend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And there is no-one there to comfort you  
With a helping hand to lend  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
For the tree of life is growing  
Where the spirit never dies  
And the bright light of salvation  
Up in dark and empty skies  
Where the cities are on fire  
With the burning flesh of men  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
And you search in vain to find  
Some law-abiding citizen  
Just remember that death is not the end  
  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end  
Not the end, not the end  
Just remember that death is not the end

Do you dare  
'Cause if you do  
Do you dare  
I just want to know  
  
Can you feel it [Repeat: x 2]  
  
[Chorus]  
Do you dare  
'Cause if you do  
I'll take you there  
Do you dare  
  
What's holding you back  
(Can you feel it)  
(Can you feel it)  
  
What's holding you back  
(Can you feel it)  
(Can you feel it)  
I just want to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you feel it [Repeat: x 2]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can you feel it [Repeat: x 2]

Enjoy it, enjoy it  
  
Never let life  
Get you down  
When your head is spinning  
Feet won't touch the ground  
For in this world  
The good time you can't plan  
You'd better take your chances while you can  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't wait 'til tomorrow  
When you should be living today  
Enjoy it, enjoy it  
Before too long it's too late  
Don't throw the good times away  
Enjoy it, enjoy it (repeat)  
  
Don't break up  
Inside  
When everything's too much  
Don't run and hide  
For nothing comes to those who will not try  
You may just as well have kissed  
Your dreams goodbye  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For nothing comes to those who hesitate  
Grab your dreams before it gets too late  
  
[Chorus until fade]

Wrapped in a blanket of hope  
Asleep in the of dreams  
My step into eternity was not what it might have been  
Or not at all  
For who knows which way the wind is gonna blow  
I'm waiting for your gentle whisper  
  
Distant child, my flower  
Are you blowing in the breeze?  
Can you feel me?  
As I breathe life into you  
In a while my flower  
Somewhere in a desert haze  
I know one day you'll amaze me  
  
An act of balancing, imagining the moment I can be  
Looking deep into your eyes  
For now a mystery  
Or not at all  
For who knows which way the wind is gonna blow  
I'm waiting for your gentle whisper  
  
Distant child, my flower  
Are you blowing in the breeze?  
Can you feel me?  
As I breathe life into you  
In a while my flower  
Somewhere in a desert haze  
I know one day you'll amaze me  
  
2 hearts in the hands of time  
Your love bleeds into mine  
I'll be with you forever  
And give you everything I am  
Want you to understand  
It's you and I together  
  
Distant child, my flower  
Are you blowing in the breeze?  
Can you feel me?  
As I breathe life into you  
In a while my flower  
Somewhere in a desert haze  
I know one day you'll amaze me

I never ask for much  
I just want some good lovin'  
More of you tender touch  
I don't C the need for rushin'  
Take it slow, slow down  
Move to the rhythm that is in my mind  
Take it slow, you know now  
Not to fast, make it last for the longest time  
  
[Chorus]  
Give it, give it to  
Give it to me like I want it  
Give it, give it to  
Give it to me like I want it  
  
I need a shot of love  
Cause I got a bad bad habit  
Can't seem to get enough  
Give it to me cause I got to have it  
  
Here we go.  
Let's go now  
Move to the rhythm that is in my mind  
Here we go you know now  
I'm the lead follow me  
for a real good time  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Givin' all your love to me  
O so right so can't you C  
You're some kind of fantasy  
Just like I want it  
  
Hit by love I don't know how  
Come to me I want you now  
Feel so high I won't come down  
Just like I want it

Last night I lost my head  
And fell right back into your love  
I lay intoxicated while angels circled high above  
  
Deep in a perfect moment  
All at once it feels so right  
But when I wake I see reality turn back and bite  
  
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah  
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah  
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah  
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah  
  
Your heartbeats ticking  
And your cool starts dripping  
And your tongue tied up on the phone  
  
Your backbones breaking  
And your smooth starts shaking  
Like you can't stand being alone  
  
Your cot starts rocking  
Little doubts start knocking  
Like the whole worlds slipping away  
  
Attentions killing  
But the ride is thrilling  
But you can't help going again  
  
What you want is what you don't know  
Turn me on and watch your ego  
What you want is what you don't need  
Stand up when your talking to me  
  
[Chorus]  
I can't start giving you up  
I'm lost without you  
Can't stop tickin' the tock  
I can't start giving you up  
I'm mad about you  
Can't stop slipping it off  
  
I can't start giving you up  
I'm lost without you  
Can't stop tickin' the tock  
I can't start giving you up  
I'm mad about you  
Can't stop slipping it off  
  
A girls got to suffer for fashion  
She knows what her body can do-ooh-ooh  
She finds a man and she makes it her passion  
I'm happy trying all the time with a boy like you  
  
A girls got to suffer for fashion  
She knows what her body can do, ooh-ooh  
She finds a man and she makes it her passion  
I'm happy trying all the time with a boy like you  
  
I can't start giving you up  
I'm lost without you  
I can't start giving you up  
I'm mad about you  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
  
Ah, hah-ah hah-ah

[Verse:]  
Glow, silhouettes and shadows  
Glow, I'm waitin' in the dark  
Oh, heavy hearts are beatin'  
Glow, close  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why won't you ever leave?  
I cry your name in pleasure every time that I'm in pain  
It's drivin' me so crazy, the way you make my heart deceive me  
I toss and I turn all night long, all night  
All night long, all night, all night long, all night  
It's alright now, alright  
It's alright now, so right  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Gold, shadows then it splatters  
Love every night, it grows  
So how I can I endure it?  
I glow  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why won't you ever leave?  
I cry your name in pleasure every time that I'm in pain  
It's drivin' me so crazy, the way you make my heart deceive me  
I toss and I turn all night long, all night  
All night long, all night, all night long, all night  
It's alright now, alright  
It's alright now, so right  
  
[Bridge:]  
It's alright now, alright  
It's alright now, so right  
It's so oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
All night long, now  
All night long, now  
All night long, now  
It's alright now, it's alright

When I was a little girl  
I used to have a dream  
Now that I'm older  
I wake up to find it isn't as good as reality  
Cause you are here with me  
I was wishing on a star out in the universe  
Now that I'm wiser I finally find that all I need is here on Earth  
Cause you are here with me  
  
Oh, I, I take a breath in and realise  
That I'm, I'm living the good life  
  
Thinking back to long ago, you were the mystery  
All of the visions that I ever had could never live up to what I see  
Cause you are here with me  
  
Oh, I, I take a breath in and realise  
That I'm, I'm living the good life  
The good life Oooh, oooh, oooh...  
I'm living the good life  
The good life  
  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life  
The good, the good, the good, the good, the good life

I've never been the type who's gonna wait around  
Not make a sound while others bring me down  
I'm not someone who'll tell you what you want to hear  
Oh you've got to feel by keeping it real  
  
And until now I've been patient  
I've been good somehow  
But anticipation's leaving me no doubt  
About how it will be  
When you let go of your fear and release  
  
[Chorus:]  
Let's move it to the fast lane  
Take a chance and love me  
I'll give you all I have  
I'm good like that  
Baby, when you crash into me  
You'll finally understand  
How loving me can change all your plans  
  
I'm good like that  
I'm good like that  
Don't make me have to tell you that I told you so  
'Cause I know you know and it's hard to hold  
I cannot do this feeling, you'll find there's double meaning  
To the things I say when you walk this way  
  
Just relax, let me take control of you, sit back  
Make you see where all this goes  
I'm in too bad - what you got to lose  
Compared to what I'm offering you?  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
I'm good like that  
I'm good like that  
So take a chance and love me fast  
I'll give you all-all that I have  
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good like that  
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good like that  
I'm good, I'm good, I'm good like that  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm good like that

You keep on asking me  
Why can't we be together  
I keep saying won't you wait a while  
What's all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time 'til i can make up my mind  
  
I'm not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I don't expect to get a guarantee  
It's just that i believe  
Lovers should stick together  
I'm only saying  
Won't you wait for me  
  
[Chorus]  
I've got to be  
Got to be certain  
I've got to be so sure  
I've had my share of hearts broken  
And i don't want to take that any more  
  
I've got some friends who say  
Boys are all the same  
They're only looking out for just one thing  
I'm only hoping that  
You won't turn out like that  
I need some time 'til i can make up my mind  
  
Been hurt in love before  
But i still come back for more  
I was such a fool  
I couldn't stop myself  
If you believe in me  
If you want our love to be  
I know you'll wait for me, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
[Chorus until fade]

The colours I see looking in your eyes  
Colours of the universe in the way they shine  
Everything's so surreal when you're close to me  
My soul just finds it hard, we were meant to be  
  
Oh, there's only ever so many hours in the day  
There's only so many notes that you can play  
But when I'm with you  
Time is never ending with the music that we make  
  
You are my harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
  
The heavens are smiling every time we kiss  
And nothing ever came so close to heaven as this  
  
You are my harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
  
And it makes my heart sing  
Ooh, it's the best thing  
When I am with you  
  
Harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
Harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony  
Harmony  
Viewpoint to my melody  
You mean everything to me  
Oh you my harmony

Lovers in the back seat  
Boys in the back street  
Girls in their tight wash  
Figure hugging blue jeans  
  
They're looking like they want  
To show out what they got  
Their feet are itching to dance  
Their bodies ready to rock  
  
I've been around the world  
But I'm not those other girls  
I'm feeling special do you like what you see?  
'Cause I got my best dress on  
Can I be your fantasy?  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock  
I can make your heartbeat rock ooh, ooh  
Baby show me what you got  
Baby show me what you got  
I can make you so damn hot  
I can make you so damn hot  
'Cause I can make your heart beat  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
Ladies in the spotlight  
Boys are checking their tights  
Skirts out while their hips sway  
Bumping to the hot track  
People take a step back  
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
I've been around the world  
But I'm not those other girls  
I'm feeling special do you like what you see?  
'Cause I got my best dress on  
Can I be your fantasy?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
'Cause I can make your heart beat  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
'Cause I can make your heart beat  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah  
Ooh, yeah, ooh, yeah

I don't really want to be the one  
To tell you time is running out  
Because it's obvious  
Just a move with the right intention  
Is all that it takes  
  
I don't really need to be the one  
To tell you things are going wrong  
Because it's obvious  
But a step in the right direction  
Is all that you need  
  
[Chorus]  
You don't have to move heaven and earth  
You don't have to change overnight  
There's never been a better time  
To make up your mind  
And put this thing right  
  
I don't mean to say that we were wrong  
But we know we need some new attention  
But just look with a new dimension  
Is all that it takes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody knows where they can make  
A change or two  
To help the situation  
Just a step with a good intention  
Is all that it takes  
  
[Chorus: x2]

We can drown any rumours bout winners and losers sayin  
"I aint' ready for that"  
When the love needs to grow and the world wants to  
Know, we gotta keep it under your hat.  
Bridge  
Sometimes those close to you find it hard to feel your pain  
Sometimes you wanna surrender, but you say here I come again.  
Chorus  
I'm the survivor  
Even denier  
I felt compasion even with knives in my back  
But you know it aint over when you feel the tears dry  
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it don't seem so black  
Oh I belive in the love that your givin and I'm ready for that yeah  
(I'm a survivor, I felt compasion,  
I'm a survivor, you can laugh at the clouds in the  
Sky aint it don't seem so bad)  
  
Feelings gone and fast then it's suddenly back you were  
Over and now your a queen,  
You forget who you are for they made you a star now  
Your hotter than you ever been  
Bridge  
Sometimes those close to you find it hard to feel your pain  
Sometimes you wanna surrender, but you say here I come again.  
Chorus  
I'm the survivor  
Even denier  
I felt compasion even with knives in my back  
But you know it aint over when you feel the tears dry  
You can laugh at the clouds in the sky and it don't seem so black  
Oh I belive in the love that your givin and I'm ready for that yeah  
I'm the survivor  
Even denier

I don't believe you know me,  
Although you know my name,  
I don't believe the thoughts I have  
Are only mine to blame  
  
I don't believe the magic,  
Is only in the mind,  
I don't believe I'd love somebody just to pass the time  
  
But I believe in you,  
I believe in you...  
  
I don't believe that beauty,  
Will ever be replaced,  
I don't believe a masterpiece could ever match a face  
  
The joker's always smiling,  
In every hand that's dealt,  
And don't believe that when you die  
Your presence isn't found  
  
But I believe in you  
I believe in you  
But I believe in you  
I believe in you...  
  
And if you ever had to go away  
Nothing in my world could ever be the same,  
Nothing lasts forever but together till then  
I'll give you everything I ever get and again  
  
'Cause I believe in you, I believe in,  
I believe in you, I believe in,  
[Repeat]  
  
But I believe in you,  
I believe in you  
[Repeat]  
  
I believe in you, I believe in [Repeat x 4]  
  
I believe, I believe, I believe... in... you.

It's in my scent  
Was something I could pick up  
I turned around  
And the whole world spun for me  
If I didn't tire of the places I wanna forget  
So we're down, we're down  
  
If every easy way in,  
Had an easy way out  
If every step, up, had no step down  
When I feel it, you can feel it  
So we're down, we're down  
  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, if only  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, only, if only  
Only, if only  
  
If some things have never been said  
If little lines in the sand could comfort me  
And erase memories I need to forget  
So we're down, we're down  
  
It's in my scent  
Was something I could pick up  
I turned around  
And the whole world spun for me  
When I feel it, you can feel it  
You can feel it  
  
If I set you free  
And you actually came back to me, take  
  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, if only  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, only, if only  
  
Oh (oh)  
If I set you free  
And you actually came back to me  
  
(If only) Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, if only  
Two hearts, wanna left to be lonely, if only  
True love, is waiting in the wings, only, if only  
  
Only, if only  
Only, if only  
Oh (oh)

You can tell me anything  
You can tell me anything  
I'll believe you  
  
You know it too  
Share the truth with lies  
Set aside one flies  
Will you realise  
  
[Chorus]  
If you don't love me  
You don't love me  
I will know  
If you don't love me  
You don't love me  
  
You can ask me anything  
You can ask me anything  
I will do it  
  
You know it too  
Nothing that I'll do  
If you want me to  
And it's all so true  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll know

Without you standing by my side  
Love and good fortune passes me by  
And you were my guiding light  
It seemed so easy  
When we said goodbye  
  
How different would the world be now  
If only we had worked it out somehow  
What kind of fools are you and I  
There would be stars up in the sky  
If you were with me now  
  
And I know I may go astray  
But who's to say that we can't change our mind  
My love burns stronger each day  
If I'm sure of one thing  
  
One love at a time  
How could we throw our love away  
When we had so much more than words can say  
The darkest clouds would fade away  
To bring the light into my day  
If you were with me now  
  
If loving you is right  
Then turn back the hands of time  
I'd do anything to make you mine  
There'snothing that I wouldn't do  
I could make you feel my love for you  
If you were with me now  
If you were with me now  
If you were with me now  

I'm seeing it your way  
But i don't believe it's true that  
I'm not the one to make you happy  
It would be so wrong for us to break in two  
But do what you gotta do  
  
[Chorus]  
I hope you find someone  
Who can love you like i do  
I'll be strong inside  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
Since the day that i found you  
I built my dreams all around you and i  
Believed you would never leave me  
So sure it was love forever more  
But if you walk out the door  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You say the magic has gone forever  
But deep down inside i don't believe it's so  
But i'm letting you go  
  
[Chorus: until fade]

A situation's taken over me  
Can't you see  
I'm in trouble?  
Infatuation's got a hold on me  
A little jealously  
I'm not myself at all  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
  
You serenade me at the ball  
Hiding from it all  
Behind a disguise  
Who's the man who's at the masquerade?  
Wish I hadn't stayed  
Just to drown in lies  
  
Like the headline of a magazine, are you what you seem  
Because I'm losing my belief?  
Can I make it when there's so much doubt  
Someone, help me out 'cause I'm in too deep  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
  
Follow my dreams into distant lands  
Blowing in the winds over shifting sands  
  
I'm in too deep  
  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
And I'm lost in this illusion  
I'm surrounded by confusion  
I'm so lost in this illusion

Spinnin' to the sound  
Like a record going round  
Let's hear the music  
We could be making out  
But all I really want right now  
Is just the music  
I'm only here to dance  
I'm not looking for romance  
So watch me work it  
I gotta get a fix  
Of my daily megamix  
So keep it groovin'  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I'm diggin' on your scene  
But music gets the best of me  
I'm so addictive  
No need to save my seat  
'Cause I'm not gonna miss a beat  
I wanna freak it  
Your conversation's fine  
But save it for some other time  
Right now I'm dancing (like a dancin' machine)  
Get with my bangin' beat  
If you know what I mean  
I wanna do it  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I really didn't mean to turn you on  
  
I'm just here for the music  
Music  
Music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on  
Music (music)  
Music  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home  
  
I'm just here for the music  
I really didn't mean to turn you on (on)  
Boy you know I like the way you move it  
So if you wanna wait for me  
I'm gonna need someone to take me home

Will you take me pool side  
To feel the summer breeze  
There's a place that looks inviting  
By the frangipani tree  
A little taste of moonlight  
And a canopy of stars  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
You're the reason I'm so high  
  
Ever had the feeling  
Something couldn't be more right  
I feel as if I know you  
And we only met tonight  
I've got a cool sensation  
I can hardly catch my breath  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
You're the reason I'm so high  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
On the ceiling  
I'm so high  
In the evening  
I'm so high  
Such a feeling  
I'm so high  
  
The party's almost over  
I don't want tonight to end  
We could be starting something  
You feel more than a friend  
The universe conspired  
For the two of us tonight  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
You're the reason I'm so high  
  
Oh  
Its a feeling  
Such a feeling  
Something I cannot hide  
You're the reason I'm so high  
  
On the ceiling  
I'm so high  
In the evening  
I'm so high  
Such a feeling  
I'm so high

Neil:  
In denial  
No, my life's a trial  
I'm not denying that every little bit hurts  
It's a problem, that I'm not solving  
Don't mind admitting  
I feel like quitting this job  
For a while,  
Getting away before it gets any worse today  
  
Kylie:  
Your in denial, and that is final  
Your not admitting, you should be quitting  
All these queens and fairies, and muscle Mary's  
The rough trade boyfriend, who in his pathetic own way denies he gay  
Why can't he see this is a fantasy  
  
Neil:  
I think I'm going mad  
How'd you know if your going mad?  
  
Kylie:  
Look at me I'm lonely  
  
Neil:  
Look at me I'm sad  
I'm not denying, I could be trying, a little harder to deal with some of this
stuff  
  
Kylie:  
Know what I'm thinking, less drugs and drinking  
No cigarettes, and you'll feel a little less worth  
  
Neil:  
Is that enough? My life is absurd  
I'm living it upside down  
Like a vampire working at night, Sleeping all day  
A dad with a girl who knows he's gay  
  
Both:  
Can you love me anyway?

What on earth am I meant to do  
In this crowded place there is only you  
Was gonna to leave now I have to stay  
You have taken my breath away  
  
Is the world still spinning around  
I don't feel like coming down  
  
It's in your eyes  
I can tell what your thinking  
My heart is sinking too  
It's no surprise  
I've been watching you lately  
I want to make it with you  
  
Destiny has a funny way  
When it comes and takes all your cares away  
I can't think of a single thing  
Other than what a beautiful state I'm in  
  
Is the world still spinning around  
I don't feel like coming down  
  
[Repeat x3]  
It's in your eyes  
I can tell what your thinking  
My heart is sinking too  
It's no surprise  
I've been watching you lately  
I want to make it with you

I drew the smile upon my face  
I paved the road that would one day leave me lonely  
No angels too good to fall from grace  
If she lets go of whatever keeps her holy  
  
But I'm still here holding on too tight, to everything that I left behind  
I don't care if the world is mine  
'Cause this is all I know  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah, tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose, into the blue  
  
I'm not ashamed of all my mistakes  
'Cause through the cold  
I still kept the fire burning  
These memories that I can't erase  
Always remind me I'm on an endless journey  
  
But I'm still here holding on too tight  
To everything that I left behind  
I don't care if the world is mine  
'Cause this is all I know  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah, tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose  
Into the blue  
  
I'll go where nobody knows  
Wherever the wind is blowing  
Even if I'm alone  
  
When I got my back up against the wall  
Don't need no one to rescue me  
'Cause I ain't waiting up for no miracle  
Yeah tonight I'm running free  
Into the blue, into the blue  
With nothing to lose  
Into the blue

It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
  
When I 1st met you, how you changed my life that day  
But with each tomorrow you just seem 2 drift away  
Then I discovered that you were cheating  
you were cheating on me  
But I was the last 2 know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
didn't I really love you, you know I gave you all my heart  
When I put my arms around you I never thought we'd ever part  
Then I discovered, I guess you couldn't love me  
Like you said you loved me, oh no  
Why was I the last to know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
All of my life I was looking for someone just like you  
you shattered my dreams, tore me apart, what can I do?  
But I was the last to know  
  
Our love was a lie  
And it's no secret, it's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret because you told everybody  
  
It's no secret, it's no secret  
It's no secret, it's no secret

Rain falling down  
Another minute passes by  
I wait for you  
But this time I won't cry  
Where are you now  
Are you with another love  
It's not the first time  
You stood me up and let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
I, I I'm wondering why  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
Lights about town  
Expect me just to hang around  
And you never call  
You just stand me up and let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I, I I I  
  
3:  
All through the night  
I wanted you to come around  
I wait to long  
I know you're gonna let me down  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi

If I'm scared let me lose it  
If I'm hungry let me have it  
If I'm cold let my skin rise  
If I'm wrong let me learn it  
If I'm grubby let the dirt stay  
If I'm tired let me shut my eyes  
  
I have dread and fear and light and laughter  
I know there is an ever after  
I'm eager and ready  
It only hurts sometimes  
I run to the future and jump  
  
If I'm hurt let me feel it  
If I'm sad let the tears run  
If I'm stupid let me be that way  
And if I'm bored let me show it  
And if I'm bad let me be it  
If I'm sure let me have my say  
  
I have dread and fear and light and laughter  
I know there is an ever after  
I'm eager and ready  
It only hurts sometimes  
I run to the future and jump

Baby, there's no way of knowing  
If we've got a good thing going  
Better not believe in true love  
That's what people say  
  
There's nothing fatal in attraction  
I'm just looking for some action  
Better not go chasing rainbows  
That's what people say  
  
Every time i see your face  
Emotion takes control of me  
It turns me round and puts me in a spin  
Oh can't you see  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to love you  
I want to be the one  
Who's holding you tonight  
I just want to love you  
Every minute of the hour  
Every morning, noon and night  
  
There's gotta be a way to show you  
I'd really like to get to know you  
I could make you happy  
If you'd take a chance on me  
  
Don't want to talk about forever  
Can't you see it's now or never  
Don't think about tomorrow  
Take a change on me  
  
You know it makes me so excited  
Every time i think of you  
It turns me round and puts me in a spin  
Oh can't you see  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to love you  
I, i just want to love you  
(holding you tonight)  
I just want to love you  
I, i just want to love you  
(every morning, noon and night)  
  
Take a chance, take a chance, chance  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Take a chance on me  
Take a chance, take a chance, chance  
Take a chance, take a chance  
Take a chance on me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I just want to love you  
I just want to love you  
(holding you tonight)  
I just want to love you  
I just want to love you  
(every morning, noon and night)  
  
[Chorus]

Me no bubbletious  
Me smoke heavy tar  
Me be groovin' slowly  
Where you are  
Notify your next of kin  
'Cause you're never coming back  
I've been dropping beats  
Since Back in Black  
And we'll paint by numbers  
'Til something sticks  
Don't mind doing it for the kids (So come on)  
Jump on board  
Take a ride (yeah) (You'll be doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high  
'Cause the kids are alright  
  
You've got a reputation  
Well I guess that can be explored  
You're dancing with  
The chairman of the board  
Take a ride on my  
Twelve cylinder symphony  
But if you got other plans  
The purpose of a woman  
Is to love her man  
  
And we'll paint by numbers  
Till something sticks  
Don't mind doing it for the kids (So come on) jump on board  
Take a ride (yeah) (Doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high  
'Cause the kids are alright  
  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
I'm gonna give it all of my loving  
It's gonna take up all of my love  
  
Come down from the ceiling  
I didn't mean to get so high  
I couldn't do what I wanted to do  
When my lips were dry  
You can't just up and leave me  
I'm a singer in a band  
Well I like drummers baby  
You're not my bag  
  
Jump on board  
Take a ride, yeah (You'll be doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high, yeah  
  
Jump on board  
Take a ride, yeah (You'll be doin' it all right)  
Jump on board feel the high, yeah  
  
I'm an honorary  
Sean Connery, born '74  
There's only one of me  
Single-handedly  
Raising the economy  
Ain't no chance of the  
Record company dropping me  
Press be asking do  
I care for sodomy  
I don't know, yeah, probably  
I've been looking  
For serial monogamy

Looks like Billy Connolly  
But for now  
I'm down for ornithology  
Grab your binoculars  
Come follow me

You stand around the edge  
Lookin' tip-top, but you forget  
That when I look at you  
Baby I see so much more you could do  
Oh, come to me  
You'd look good in company  
And your wish is my command  
All you got to do is take my hand  
  
Come to me, come to me  
Don't you understand  
  
That body was made for dancin'  
So follow me down this way  
Come on, now twist it  
Turn it, turn it  
Push it, burn it, burn it  
Made for dancin'  
Totally designed to shake  
So come on, now twist it  
Turn it, turn it  
Push it, burn it, burn it  
  
Dress up, look the part  
Tie your name up on my heart  
Don't be so shy about it  
Don't get uptight about it  
Move close, can't you see  
You know you're gonna feel good next to me  
Cause oh, oh, don't you know  
  
That body was made for dancin'

Dance floor royalty  
Famous on the disco scene  
Royalty unwavering  
Be my king or queen

We'll win a war  
We'll be ?  
Do you feel me  
  
There's a look in your eyes  
Something is up tonight  
I can feel it  
  
The air is thin  
We're scent of it  
And the dam won't break  
One tear falls, tension cracks the walls  
Then relief comes  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
We've got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all  
  
Look, we're still up  
Like twosome should do  
Do you feel me  
Come out for air  
It's dark in there  
Do you love me  
  
Am I broke up  
It's to my rocks  
Tell the face babe  
One tear falls falls, tension cracks the walls  
Then relief comes  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
We've got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all  
  
Me and you  
Baby we made it through  
Me and you  
We've got some loving to do  
Kiss me once  
And you will watch me fall  
Kiss me twice  
And I will give you my all

I'm seeing in your way  
But I don't believe it's true  
That I'm not the one to make you happy  
It would be so wrong  
For us to break in two  
But do what you gotta do  
  
I hope that you find someone  
Who can love you like I do  
I'll be strong inside  
But i'll still be loving you  
  
It's no secret (x4)  
  
When I first meet you  
How you changed my life that day  
But with each tomorrow  
You just seem to drift away  
  
Then I discovered  
That you were cheating  
You were cheating on me  
But I was the last to know  
Ooh, ooh  
  
Our love was a life  
And it's no secret  
It's no secret  
How you hurt me inside  
And it's no secret  
Because you told everybody  
  
Rain falling down  
Another minute passes by  
I'll wait for you  
But this time I won't cry  
Where are you now  
Are you with another love  
It's not the first time  
You stood me up and let me down  
I, I, I'm wondering why  
  
I still love you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
I still want you  
Je ne sais pas pourquoi  
  
Did you believe I'd let you down  
Your jealous heart  
Gave you the runaround  
You couldn't see that  
I would always be a friend  
If you could look inside your heart  
And understand what's tearing you apart  
You gotta trust someone  
Don't let hate get in the way  
  
Just turn it into love  
Turn it into love  
And open up your heart  
And you'll never feel ashamed  
If you turn it, turn it  
Turn it into love  
  
In my imagination  
There is no complication  
I dream about you all the time  
In my mind of celebration  
The sweetest of sensation  
Thinking you could be mine  
In my imagination  
There is no hesitation  
We walk together hand in hand  
I'm dreaming  
  
You fell in love with me  
Like I'm in love with you  
But dreaming's all I do  
If only they'd come true  
  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
I should be so lucky  
Lucky, lucky, lucky  
I should be so lucky in love  
  
You keep on asking me  
Why can't we be together  
I keep saying  
Won't you wait a while  
What's all the hurry  
I thought we had forever  
I just need time  
Till I can make up my mind  
  
I'm not asking for  
A love to last forever  
I don't expect  
To get a guarantee  
It's just that I believe  
Lovers should stick together  
I'm only saying  
Won't you wait for me  
  
I've got to be  
Got to be certain  
I've got to be so sure  
I've had my share  
Of hearts broken  
And I don't wanna take that anymore  
  
All aboard!

Oh the weather outside is frightful,  
But the fire is so delightful,  
And since we've no place to go,  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!  
  
It doesn't show signs of stopping,  
And I've bought some corn for popping,  
The lights are turned way down low,  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight,  
How I'll hate going out in the storm!  
But if you'll really hold me tight,  
All the way home I'll be warm.  
  
The fire is slowly dying,  
And, my dear, we're still good-bying,  
But as long as you love me so,  
Let It Snow! Let It Snow! Let It Snow!

Boy, ya, you got it, got it  
You got me feelin' crazy 'bout my body  
I, I cannot cannot stop it  
You got Me movin', got me rockin' rockin'  
  
[Chorus]  
Make me feel like I can make it real  
You got me hooked, gettin' me on the floor  
If I'm a tease and you're the one to please, I want more  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dance like I'm the only, only  
Like I'm the only lady, like you want me  
Damn right, I have my radar on you  
So let's get physical, I want to, want to  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine  
You really blow my mind  
When we rock, when we rock  
I really wanna do, everything with you  
The things you make me do, like a drug, like a drug  
  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
I never had a ride, as delicate and fine  
You really blow my mind  
I really wanna do, everything with you  
The things you make me do  
  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug  
Like a drug, like a drug

I see them all smiling  
Those all around me  
Tend to my wounds and alert my senses  
It would be nice  
I'm not here  
I'm dreaming  
Holding on  
  
Time has no meaning  
All of it wasted  
Smothers till there is no more air  
When will it be that I can breathe again  
I'm waiting in the void  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo)  
  
This notion of needing had held me ransom  
And all I can do is avoid my mind  
Don't make me speak or hear or look  
Because I'm hurting  
Help me out  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) I'm in limbo  
Limbo  
  
I'm getting tired  
I'm getting tired  
  
Caught in a crossfire  
Nobody gets it  
I'm finding it hard to contain myself  
Take all my trust and faith and hope  
until I need it once again  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) I'm lost in limbo  
(Limbo) I'm in limbo  
  
(Limbo) lost in limbo  
(Limbo) limbo, limbo  
(Limbo) I'm lost in limbo  
(Limbo) I'm in limbo  
  
Limbo

(Live and learn)  
Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
(Live and learn)  
  
You can never undo  
Whatever's been done  
You're so afraid  
That true love may never come  
  
Maybe tomorrow will bring  
Happiness in  
And in a little while  
You could learn to smile  
Again, oh, oh  
  
But never give up  
That's a big mistake  
Be true to your heart  
And even if it breaks  
You can still  
  
Love another day  
Find another way  
Take a little time  
And you could find  
That one day your heart  
Will have a home  
  
[Chorus]  
Live and learn  
When the morning comes  
You'll see things in a different light  
Give a little time  
Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you  
To live and learn  
  
What's done is done  
Past is past  
You can look around  
But you can never go back, keep on  
  
Living your life  
Living it right  
Take a little time  
And you could find  
That one day your heart  
Will have a home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
To live and learn  
(Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you)  
Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you  
(Don't be afraid to  
Do what you must do  
It's all up to you)  
To live and learn  
  
Love another day  
Find another way  
Take a little time  
And you could find  
That one day your heart  
Will have a home  
  
[Chorus: x2]

I am lost in the world of you  
Can't believe where you take me to  
As soon as you enter my mind or you crawl over my skin  
Leave me no other choice but to let you in  
Love takes over me  
(I can feel it)  
'Cause your love takes over me  
(I can see it)  
Oh, your love takes over me  
(I can taste it)  
Yeah, your love takes over me  
(I can be it)  
Take, take me now  
I can't take no more  
Feel me breathe  
Feel the energy  
How did I fall prey to this  
Pleasure is my lonely guide  
Yeah, I escaped despite of you  
Now that you're inside  
Love takes over me  
(I can feel it)  
When your love takes over me  
(I can see it)  
Your love takes over me  
(I can taste it)  
Yeah, your love takes over me  
(I can be it)  
Magic is running through my veins  
Pleasure is coming closer then  
So, hurt with me now  
So I won't hurt no more  
Hear me scream  
Hear my suffering  
When your love takes over me  
(I can feel it)  
Your love takes over me  
(I can see it)  
Love takes over me  
(I can taste it)  
Love takes over me  
(I can be it)  
(I can feel it)  
Love takes over me  
(I can see it)  
Your love takes over me  
(I can taste it)  
Love takes over me  
(I can be it)  

I'll dive deep, I have fallen all the way  
Happily there's no escape  
Surrender to your heart  
  
Giving in to all of this  
Fascinated by your kiss  
I'm floating in your arms  
  
Take your time, just unwind  
Ooh, I want to breathe you in  
A little while to ease your mind  
You're the world I'm living in  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
Fantasy, feel it rushing over me  
Nowhere else I want to be  
My love is by my side  
  
For a moment you and me  
Holding on to ecstasy  
Give us all day and night  
  
Take your time, just unwind  
Ooh, I want to breathe you in  
A little while to ease your mind  
You're the world I'm living in  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
These are loving days with you  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you  
  
Precious time with you  
Diving in the blue  
We are riding on the waves  
These are loving days  
Loving days with you

Loving is fun when the dangers begun  
And you're makin' me run again oh-oh-oh  
When you're calling I'm climbing the wall  
I know that I'm only to blame  
Feels so divine when you're close to the line  
And there's reason to run again oh-oh-oh  
Make me wait it's a beautiful ache  
I know that it's part of the game  
  
I've got mud on my face  
From every thrill of the chase  
But I'm fine  
My heart is heavy with dirt  
And every little bit hurts  
I don't mind  
I give as good as Itake  
And boy you're letting me break my rules  
I love the lows and the highs  
You make me twinkle inside  
And I'm cool  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied  
  
Chorus  
'Cos loving you don't mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed don't mean I'll get in the mood  
'Cos loving you don't make me on your side  
You can't take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
'Cos loving you don't mean Ilost my groove  
And baby breakfast in bed don't mean I'll get in the mood  
'Cos loving you don't make me on your side  
You can't take the diamonds that are in my eyes  
  
So when the good times fly and it's cold outside  
I won't be dancing with myself  
And if the world's unfair and it's cold out there  
I won't be dancing with myself  
So when I got no jive and it's cold outside  
I won't be dancing with myself  
I let my heartbeat go 'cos inside I know  
I won't be dancing with myself  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied  
  
It doesn't matter what the movies say  
(Oh no) I like it better when you walk away  
And you can fool me with those golden eyes  
(Oh yeah) We're on the road to knowing satisfied  
(satisfied, satisfied, satisfied)

It wasn't always like this  
It wasn't always so  
We did it in the darkness  
We did it in the cold  
  
Caught in a fairly extraordinary world  
It's emotional  
Where talking it rarely that necessary  
And time doesn't count at all  
  
Bohemian boys and Brazilian girls  
Make familiar noise in a familiar world  
Its like a million beats in a Parisian heart  
(They're made of glass)  
  
Working the west with the girls from the east  
Working a sweat from a million beats  
Where oblivion stops and oblivion starts  
(They're made of glass)  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(Like it knows my name)  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(Were made of glass)  
  
It wasn't always easy  
It wasn't always fun  
We intertwine naively  
But in the end we're one  
  
Caught in a fairly extraordinary world  
It's emotional  
Where talking it rarely that necessary  
And time doesn't count at all  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(Like it knows my name)  
  
Love makes the world go round  
I hold it in my hands  
But it slips away  
(And I watch it fade)  
  
Love is a mystery  
I hear it talk to me  
But the words are strange  
(They're made of glass)

Oh, oh, oh, don't, don't ask me to dance  
I'm scared, this feeling's out of my hands  
That look just took my breath away  
It's plugged me into you  
  
And I'm tuning in, tuning in slowly like a radio  
(Radio, radio, radio)  
You pull me in, pull me in, baby, and I can't let go  
Can't stop, now where?  
  
Two hot bodies with chemistry that's on the rise  
It's electric, magnetic electric  
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight  
  
Two hot bodies bound together with no choice  
It's electric, magnetic electric  
Star crossed lovers drowned in the sound of this white noise  
  
Oh yes, oh yes, I'm hearing it loud  
I must confess I like it  
It's everything I wanted and more  
You give me bait, I bite it  
  
And I'm tuning in, tuning in slowly like a radio  
(Radio, radio, radio)  
It's coming in, coming in, this signal is out of control  
Can't stop, now where?  
  
Two hot bodies with chemistry that's on the rise  
It's electric, magnetic electric  
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight  
  
Two hot bodies bound together with no choice  
It's electric, magnetic electric  
Star crossed lovers drowned in the sound of this white noise  
  
It's electric, magnetic electric  
White noise  
  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Two hot bodies with chemistry that's on the rise  
It's electric, magnetic electric  
The heat screams out and echoes all around tonight  
  
Two hot bodies bound together with no choice  
It's electric, magnetic electric  
Star crossed lovers drowned in the sound of this white noise

I was so close to the edge  
I was falling down  
You come and turn it around  
And let me see again, let me see you again  
Caught in the eye of the storm  
I was sure I'd drown  
But you made me reach deep down  
Assured of the strength I'd found,  
The strength I'd found yeah  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me, oh  
  
There was the time  
I would go with the rolling tide  
I wanted an easy ride  
I thought it was all a game  
The thunder struck and it changed  
  
And then I was scared, I was scared I was terrified  
But you made me reach inside  
As certain that I'd survive, I'd survive  
But all night I'm lying awake  
It feels like my body's afraid to say  
Too much to put into words  
A dam about to burst, ohh-oh  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me, oh  
  
Only you understand me  
Want the truth not the fantasy  
I'm as true as I can be  
Hear me now  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me, oh  
As far away as they can take me, oh  
  
Mighty rivers run right through me  
I fall in if I dive in too deep  
In the shadows swim with daydreams  
As far away as they can take me, oh

Right in front of your eyes  
Why can't you see me?  
Can't you read all the signs  
Why can't you feel it?  
  
Can we love just a little bit harder  
My heart's beating to this drum  
It hasn't even started  
But I know that it's love  
  
'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away  
Feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away

'Cause I'm always craving your touch  
My daydreams are amazin'  
Oh boy you're never too much  
  
I wanna love just a little bit harder  
My heart's beating to this drum  
It hasn't even started  
But I know that it's love  
  
'Cause I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away  
Feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away  
When you touch my body  
I go weak but you're so hard for me to reach  
I feel like I'm a million, million  
Feel like I'm a million miles away, miles away  
  
I feel so invisible why can't you see me?  
You're the one that I want it's so clear to me.  
I feel so invisible.  
I feel so invisible.  
I feel so

Don't ya think it was a good thing baby?  
Don't ya think we nearly got it right?  
We could work to a rhythm baby  
If we come together overnight  
  
My eyes are open and my, my heart is?  
I'll never ever faulter  
You know my love is real  
It's just my situation  
Can't help the way I feel  
No time for contemplation  
You know my love is real  
  
Don't ya think it was a good thing baby?  
Don't ya think we nearly got it right?  
We could work to a rhythm baby  
If we come together overnight  
  
My eyes are open and my, my heart is?  
I'll never ever faulter  
You know my love is real  
It's just my situation  
Can't help the way I feel  
No time for contemplation  
You know my love is real

I look at your picture  
And stare into space  
I think I must know  
Every line on your face  
And you'll never know  
The feelings I keep  
Like the man in the moon  
You're way out of reach  
  
So dreams are all I have  
Because we're worlds apart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I write you these letters  
That I'll never send  
It's crazy I know  
But still I pretend  
Though we've never met  
Don't think I'm naive  
I know you so well  
Though it's all make believe  
  
And dreams are all I have  
Because you're far away  
All alone with my secret heart  
All alone with my secret heart  
  
I must have held your hand  
A thousand times  
And felt your heart was beating  
Next to mine  
Even though it's just a lie  
There are no tears in my eyes  
  
If your picture could speak to me  
What would you say  
Maybe you'd just have to  
Laugh in my face  
  
And dreams would be much better  
Than reality  
  
All alone with my secret heart

Why can't you see  
That I'm still mad about you  
Even though I've found out about you  
I'll always stay forever true  
  
[Bridge]  
And in my heart  
I will forgive you  
I've got so much love to give you  
  
[Chorus]  
It's never too late  
We've still got time  
It's never too late  
You can still be mine  
It's never too late  
To change your mind  
  
2:  
Why can't you try  
And be a man about it  
And if you stop and think about it  
You just can't keep walking out on me  
And even if it takes forever  
Your love's better late than never  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Repeat: x3]  
It's never too late  
  
To change your mind  
  
Though I try  
I can never put you from my mind  
You just creep right back inside  
And there's no place I can hide  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus: Repeats]

Ah ah Ah ah Ah ah  
Wonder in you're wilderness  
Close enough take a breath  
Closer still touch you're skin  
Open up (open up)  
Let me in  
Don't you know you're taking me down  
You're making me high  
My life's turned around  
Now safe me tonight  
No better love  
Than when we make it  
To get up and taste it  
Intoxication this elation  
Uh uh there's no better love  
Follow up my fantasies  
So nice ment to be  
Nicer still what's to come  
Take a ride (take a ride)  
Come undone  
Don't you know you're taking me down  
You're making me high  
My life's turned around  
Now safe me tonight

Uh uh there's no better love  
No better love, no better love

Have you ever thought that the sky was just endlessly dark?  
And then look up and see a million stars  
Have you ever been scare off the water it's stuck on the edge?  
And then you dive in, how quickly you'll forget  
  
You know fears, they capture the way, get by  
Now that I'm back in the light, so warm I feel it like a  
  
[Chorus]  
Wave of love coming over me  
Got greater drop fall and I'm on my knees  
Got the sound of you ringing in my ears  
Sun coming up on another day  
Got a second hand change gonna do it again  
Got rainbow colors and no more rain  
  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
  
Have you ever dreamed you were flying until you look down?  
You never moved an inch feet firmly on the ground (feet on firmly on the
ground)  
  
Our love carries a hurt that you hold  
Funny how live can unfold, oh yeah I feel it like a  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Rain) no more

(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
(Rain) no more  
(Rain) no more

(Rain) no more

I've gone a long, long way  
Since the day you walked into my life  
We've smoothed out all the rough edges  
Of our sweet love and devotion  
The price is high given life as a scale  
Wondering where I'd gone wrong  
And I know it's going to work out fine  
When I see that look in your eyes  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
Yeah, nothing can stop us now  
[Incomprehensible] some people say  
That a man who thinks that a woman is weak  
Is so wrong  
'Cause nobody can hide from you  
We both know something else is true  
Just the touch of your hand  
And I know we're going to make it  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
I never felt so good  
I never felt so strong  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now  
Nothing can stop us now  

I like it  
Nu nu di di ty  
Let me let me see  
Nu di ty  
  
Hang your coat up, hang your coat up  
Lock the doors up, lock the doors up  
Let the steam rise in the spotlight (alright)  
Are you ready to let it go tonight? (tonight)  
Do your own thing with your own thing  
Whoo, shake a hip  
It's getting cool swing  
Ooh, ooh, guess who is watching now  
Look, looking, looking wow  
  
[Chorus]  
Flash it in fashion with me  
Skin to skin, body to body  
Dare to never, never let me see  
Nu-di-ty  
  
Nu nu di di ty  
Nu-di-ty  
  
Time to strip down  
Time to strip down  
Just pop that zipper for me  
And work that thing out  
Just expose it  
'Cause you know it's, alright (alright)  
Are you ready to let it go tonight? (tonight)  
Let it go, here we go  
Just let it slip inside  
That's right, here we go  
One button at a time  
Who cares who sees tonight?  
Look, looking, looking wow  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nu-di-ty  
Nu-di-ty  
Never, never let me see  
Nu-di-ty  
Never, never see

Dress me up a thousand ways  
You're counting down the days  
'Till I fall from my pedestal  
And then you can rescue me  
All the world can see  
You're the center of it all  
  
We gave it our best try  
But then it was goodbye  
We were better off alone  
But now that's all gone for you  
And life is wrong for you  
But I can't help that  
  
You don't need love  
It's a question of obsession  
So drawn to your own reflection  
You want someone  
Like a personal possession  
To shine light on your perfection  
  
Call me up a thousand times  
You're hanging on the line  
Waiting for me to react  
But we've been here before  
And when I closed the door  
I never wanted a second act  
  
I saw it all clearly  
But you didn't hear me  
Thought our love was centre stage  
But now that's all gone for us  
And you are dangerous  
And I can't help that  
  
You don't need love  
It's a question of obsession  
So drawn to your own reflection  
You want someone  
Like a personal possession  
To shine light on your perfection  
  
You don't need love  
It's a question of obsession  
So drawn to your own reflection  
You want someone  
Like a personal possession  
To shine light on your perfection  
  
Gave my heart a thousand times  
And I can't count the nights  
That I cried myself to sleep  
But now I'm so over you  
And I see what you do  
Your sincerity's kinda cheap  
  
Remember the mind games  
Driving me insane  
When my life was not my own  
And even though you have gone  
It still carries on  
And I can't stop it  
  
You don't need love  
It's a question of obsession  
So drawn to your own reflection  
You want someone  
Like a personal possession  
To shine light on your perfection  
  
You don't need love  
It's a question of obsession  
So drawn to your own reflection  
You want someone  
Like a personal possession  
To shine light on your perfection

Taking some time in the still  
Memories lead me far away  
The sun is dancing on the sea  
I thank the gods for today  
  
Ocean blue  
Blue, my sky  
Spell of you  
Colours my mind  
Floating in time  
Thinking of you  
Ocean blue  
  
Giving in to my questions  
The silence shows me the way  
Making my mark on tomorrow  
Doing nothing today  
  
Ocean blue  
Blue, my sky  
Spell of you  
Colours my mind  
Floating in time  
Thinking of you  
Ocean blue  
  
Living and dreaming, always believing  
Living and dreaming, always believing  
  
Ocean blue  
Blue, my sky  
Spell of you  
Colours my mind  
Floating in time  
Thinking of you  
Ocean blue

AMERICAN RADIO PRESENTER VOICE: "And now for our feature presentation"  
I guess I was in this situation and it wasn't right,  
A bad combination and the wrong type,  
I completely lost my cool locked in this state of mind.  
I played a wicked game, mmm,

Giving everything but getting no gain,

I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
1:  
Some girls, say in their world  
They couldn't bear to have just him  
But I, don't need a load of guys  
To pump up my self esteem  
  
Girl what you doin' with just one guy  
Given' all my lovin'  
What you gonna do when  
There's lipstick on his collar  
You're gonna get old before your time  
You can't tell me nothing,  
'bout this man of mine  
  
CHORUS:  
No other love could ever  
Compare to my lover  
I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
No other touch could mean half as much  
As my lover  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
2:  
Check it out  
  
Some guys never realise  
What a girl needs from a man  
But my guy always satisfies  
It's a love we understand  
  
Don't you want to go out and play  
I'm sorry but I'm busy  
What if you call and there isn't any answer  
You're gonna find him gone one day  
He'll always be with me no matter what you say  
  
CHORUS:  
  
No other kiss is the one that I miss  
With my lover  
I'm a one boy, one boy girl  
No other man could love like he can  
As my lover  
You know I'm a one boy girl  
  
RAP:  
Hey you kylie...mmm hmmm  
What's up with this one-boy-girl thing...well  
Let me break it down like this, yeah right  
It doesn't play to stay or be good  
You know how guys are, I don't think he good  
Be with just one, and what if he cheats ya  
Girl just have fun go out and meet ya  
Two or three more.. I don't think so  
You should see more..no I don't think so  
How could you be sure..I believe him  
You're in for heartbeat you don't need him  
What if he hurts you..he won't do that  
Are you sure...yeah that's a fact  
There's lots of guys in this world  
Not for me, I'm a one-boy-girl  
  
No other love (no other love)  
My lover, ohh

No other touch (no other touch)  
My lover, ohh  
One boy, one boy girl, yeah  
  
CHORUS

When all the world is a hopeless jumble,  
And the raindrops tumble all around,  
Heaven opens a magic lane.  
When all the clouds darken up the skyway,  
There's a rainbow highway to be found,  
Leading from your window pane,  
To a place behind the sun,  
Just a step beyond the rain.  
  
Somewhere, over the rainbow, way up high,  
There's a land that I heard of once in a lullaby.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue,  
And the dreams that you dare to dream,  
Really do come true.  
  
Someday, I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
Away above the chimney tops,  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, bluebirds fly.  
Birds fly over the rainbow,  
Why then, oh, why can't I?  
If all those little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow,  
Why, oh why, can't I?

I'm saying all the things that I know you like  
Making good conversation  
I've gotta handle you just right  
You know what I mean  
  
I took you to an intimate restaurant  
Then to a suggestive movie  
There's nothing left to talk about  
Unless it's horizontally  
  
[Chorus]  
Let's get physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
  
I've been patient, I've been good  
Tried to keep my hands on the table  
Oh it's getting hard to hold me back  
You know what I mean  
  
I'm sure you understand my point of view  
We know each other better  
You've gotta know you're bringing out  
The animal in me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(Physical) I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
  
(Get physical)  
(Do you hear me)  
(Mmm, yeah)  
(C'mon)  
(I know you want me)  
(Physical)  
  
Woah, yeah  
Physical, physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
I want to get physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk  
Let's get physical, physical  
I want to get physical  
Let's get into physical  
Let me hear your body talk, your body talk  
Let me hear your body talk

Remember how it used to be,  
Remember how you promised me,  
That life would always be good,  
You forget the fact you lied to me,  
You locked my heart and threw the key,  
  
I'm so misunderstood,  
What to say when all the words have gone,  
Promises, promises,  
What to do when all our thoughts have flown  
  
Promises, promises,  
Remember how I gave my heart,  
And all at once we fell  
  
Apart, Was I supposed to forgive you,  
You forgot the fact you said to me,  
That we were for eternity,  
You're so easy to see through,  
What to say when  
  
All the words have gone,  
Promises, promises,  
What to do when all our  
Thoughts have flown,  
Promises, promises  
  
Remember that I'm over you,  
And know that I will make it through,  
Hope you never forget it,  
The promises you made to me,  
Were really lies and fantasy,  
Hope you come to regret it  
  
What to say when all the tears have dried,  
Promises, promises,  
What to think when all our love has died,  
Promises, promises,  
The promises we used to keep have gone,  
And with them all the words  
  
That kept us both from seeing what was wrong,  
The rest is silent,  
What to say when all the words have gone,  
Promises, promises,  
What to do when all our thoughts have flown,  
Promises, promises,  
What to say when all the tears have dried,  
Promises, promises,  
What to think when all our love has died,  
Promises, promises.

I look around, I see a million different faces  
But no one's lookin' in my eyes  
It takes a minute when I'm in these different places  
To realize  
All we need is love in this life, it's true  
All I need is the love I get from you  
And I wanna scream it out  
If you hear what I'm sayin'  
Put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
No matter what, we're gonna take this moment  
Now come on, baby, you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Everybody knows how life can get so twisted  
But I won't let it bring me down  
And there's no point in ever tryin' to resist it  
Just work it out  
All we need is love in this life, it's true  
All I need is the love I get from you  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
No matter what, we're gonna take this moment  
Now come on baby you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
If you're comin' out tonight  
Let me hear it now  
Said if you're comin' out tonight  
Let me hear it  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
Now put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love  
No matter what, we're gonna take this moment  
Now come on, baby, you can show me  
So put your hands up  
If you're feelin' love tonight  
If you're feelin' love

Count backwards 5 4 3 2 1  
Before you get too heated and turned on  
(This guy)  
You should have learned your lesson all them times before  
You've been bruised,you've been broken  
Then there's my mind saying think before you go  
Through that door,it could lead you nowhere

[Chorus(x2):]  
Boy,boy let me keep freaking around  
I want to get down

What's the point in hanging round  
Don't want to keep turning it down  
When this girl wants to rock with you  
  
My conscience saying,get down off this dream  
It's too dangerous and deadly  
(This guy)  
Has got you talking round in circles can't you see  
All for the sake of sexy  
(You're loving it)  
Then there's my sense saying stop before you fall  
I don't want to pick you up again  
(This guy)  
Has got you all romantic,crazier each day  
Do you think I'd listen,there's no way...  
  
[Bridge:]  
'cause I can't focus ,I can't stop  
You got me spinning ,round,round,round,round

When this girl wants to rock with you  
  
Let me keep freaking around  
(Freaking around,freaking around)  
Red blooded woman  
It's too hot inside  
You'll never get to Heaven if you're scared of getting high

Back on my feet  
Another week is nearly over  
We gotta meet

And now all I want is you tonight

From here and into heaven  
Need to escape

My desire's getting stronger  
I can't hold back any longer  
Next to me you belong  
Now I'm living for the moment  
When you're gonna come on over to me  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause I want you to be  
Right here right now  
I believe  
You were meant to be  
Right here right now  
Right here right now  
  
I can't fight the situation  
I'm giving in to  
Your temptation  
Every time I see your face  
I need you more and more  
When are you gonna come on over to me  
  
[Chorus: x 2]  
  
'Cause I want you to be  
Right here right now  
'Cause I want you to be  
  
Now I'm living for the moment  
When you're gonna come over to me

Santa baby, slip a sable under the tree, For me.  
I've been an awful good girl,  
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight.  
  
Santa baby, a 54 convertible too, Light blue.  
I'll wait up for you dear,  
Santa baby, and hurry down the chimney tonight.  
  
Think of all the fun I've missed,  
Think of all the fellas that I haven't kissed,  
Next year I could be just as good,  
If you'd check out my Christmas list,  
Boo doo bee doo.[background]

Sensitized by every word that you say  
Boy you got me messed up  
But I like it that way  
  
Tantalized just too good to refuse  
When I try to stop ya  
You keep blowing my fuse  
  
Can't deny how hot the feeling  
If the body could fly  
I'd hit the ceiling cause I  
  
[Chorus 1]  
Can't hold back, the minute I try  
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized  
Every touch, whatever you do  
Baby you trip the switch, I turn on for you  
  
Energized by all the pleasure and pain  
Boy got that something  
That burns a spark to the flame  
  
Look at me, you got me begging for more  
'Cause you got that one thing  
I hadn't discovered before  
  
Can't deny how rude I'm feeling  
If the body could talk  
You'd hear me screaming cause I  
  
[Chorus 1]  
  
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive  
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive  
I'm sensitized tonight and you can watch me come alive  
I'm sensitized tonight, I'm sensitized tonight  
  
[Chorus 2]  
I can't hold back, the minute I try  
Baby you trip the switch and I'm sensitized  
Every touch, whatever you do  
Baby you trip the switch, I turn on for you, I turn on for you  
  
[Chorus 2]

Baby you know it's true, I feel this for you  
I come alive  
Baby you know it's true, I feel this for you  
  
I come alive

There you go.  
You're like fireworks and it's the fourth of July.  
I can't turn away, look what you've done to me.  
One more dance and I'm taking over,  
I need your touch.  
One more dance when you're lickin' your lips,  
I'm gonna have to rush this night,  
We should get outta here,  
Might have to party for two,  
Then you say you love me  
That talk is dangerous  
I want you like I know you want me  
Am I saying too much?  
Right now, say what you want to  
You can't make me blush.  
  
Step through the door

Step on my floor

You're on fire  
But you play it cool  
Every eye on you  
  
So don't blame me  
For wanting you just too much  
You're sexy  
And what you need's a sexy love  
All I see  
Every time I look at you  
Is you are free  
I just wanna be with you  
Give me that sexy love  
  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my head  
You look so sexy, so sexy in my bed  
  
We got places to go  
There's so much I wanna see  
Let's make out on the low  
And just focus on us  
I want you to feel like you're having the time of your life  
And I can't wait to start like you're waiting, accept my invite

Give me that sexy love

Tell me I'm only dreaming and I'll believe you  
Can't see how this could be true  
Surrounded by feelings I hardly recognise  
I look for explanations I'm taken by surprise  
If you told me yesterday that I could feel this way  
I would sure enough call you a liar to your face  
  
[Chorus]  
Because I'm shocked by the power  
(Shocked) ooh  
Shocked by the power of love  
I was rocked to my very foundations  
Shocked by the power, shocked by the power  
  
Maybe this time tomorrow  
I'll discover this ain't really real  
'cause it struck me like lightning  
Like a bolt out of the blue  
Emotions inside me, all over you  
I'm high above the Universe, losing track of time  
And falling free  
I can't believe that you are really mine  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Shocked, like the lightning from up above  
Down from the heavens and it gave me love  
From a man who respects me  
Loves my mind as well as my body  
No retreat and no surrender  
Equal to you regardless of gender  
Giving me love that is warm and tender  
That's why I gotta tell ya  
  
You and I are of the same mind  
It seems to me that we're one of a kind  
It's true to say that when love is blind  
But then true love is so hard to find  
You respect me and the things I do  
It was meant to be  
I was made for you  
Open the door to my heart, it's stopped  
And I'm shocked....  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Surrounded by feelings I hardly recognise,  
I look for explanations I'm taken by surprise.  
'Cause it struck me like lightning,  
Like a bolt out of the blue,  
Emotions inside me, all over you.  
  
[Chorus until fade]

Lying on the ground together staring at the stars  
The night can carry us forever we're ready to go far...  
Beyond the realm of us is nothing nothing that matters  
The world can fall apart but love, love won't be shattered!  
You take the words from my mouth  
Like you take the beat from my heart...  
Never had this with anyone else  
I just don't wanna be apart  
I understand you in the silence  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard...  
Time has lost it's meaning when you hold me in your arms  
And I can hear so clearly in the quiet in the dark  
Skin to skin so close to me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be...  
You take the words from my mouth  
Like you take the beat from my heart  
Never had this with anyone else  
I just don't wanna be apart  
I understand you in the silence...  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard  
Skin to skin to skin so close to me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be...  
Skin to skin to skin!  
Skin to skin to skin!  
I understand you in the silence  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard...  
I understand you in the silence  
So there's no need to say a word  
It feels so right you can't deny it  
The best is what you haven't heard...

I don't think you know that I hear you  
That you've been talking in your sleep  
You've been saying crazy things yeah  
As it all unfolds I get a clear view  
Of what you've been doing to me  
You've been lying through you're teeth  
And it makes me want to scream  
  
It's like I don't know who you are  
Feels like a dagger in my heart  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy  
Can't stop replaying the words you said  
You're like a stranger in my bed  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy  
  
What is it she does that I don't do  
Is she far more beautiful  
Does she make you feel at home  
Was it not enough, that I love you  
But you've been giving her your kiss  
And it almost makes me sick  
That I have to hear like this  
  
It's like I don't know who you are  
Feels like a dagger in my heart  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy  
Can't stop replaying the words you said  
You're like a stranger in my bed  
Suddenly now it seems  
I'm sleeping with the enemy

Slow Motion  
Kylie Minogue  
Sink into srenity,  
Speak in lovers tounge,  
Give into delicious dreams,  
The future has begun,  
Dare to drown in pleasures found,  
I'm just surrendering.  
Coz' I don't want to miss a thing.  
I'm living in slow motion,  
Wish I could freeze this space in time.  
Everything's wide open,  
Now that you're here, it's unspoken,  
It's all in the way your hands it mine,  
Skin on my skin,  
I think it's love, I've fallen into.  
Savouring the pure desire the passions come undone,  
With every kiss,  
The colors change, bleeding into one.  
In days gone by, I'd be wandering if this feelings gonna last,  
But I don't even have to ask.  
Coz were living in slow motion,  
Wish I could freeze this space in time,  
Everything's wide open,  
Now that you're here, it's unspoken,  
It's all in the way your hands it mine,  
Skin on my skin,  
I think it's love, I've fallen into.  
I'm living in slow motion.

Remember when I saw you for the first time  
I never thought you'd be mine  
Then we went ahead and fell in love  
Heaven was a common ground  
We were never coming down  
The two of us we had more than enough  
You and I are not the same  
To you love is just a game  
Things will never be the same again  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
Stayed for way too long  
Started out with trust  
But it isn't just about the good times baby  
  
Remember all the promises we swore to  
Can't say I didn't warn you  
How I did adore you way back then (I did adore you adore you)  
Ohhhhh  
But you broke a solemn vow  
Ha! you're paying for it now  
Wouldn't you expect more from a friend  
You and I are not the same  
To you love is just a game  
Things will never be the same again  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
Stayed for way too long  
Started out with trust  
But it isn't just about the good times baby  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
I stayed for way too long  
I don't need you now  
And I am oh so tired of excuses baby  
  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
Goodbye  
  
This time will be gone goodbye  
Stayed for way to long this time  
It all started out with trust  
But it isn't about the good times baby  
  
So now goodbye  
This time I will be gone goodbye  
I stayed for way too long  
I don't need you now  
And I am oh so tired of excuses baby

Shut my eyes  
Feel the color of you  
So get to this elation  
So high so fast  
  
Shut my eyes  
Feel the color of you  
Succumb to this illusion  
So strong so deep  
  
'cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss  
'cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss  
  
Study my reflection  
And let the colors fall  
Slip into stillness  
And be above it all  
  
Good to be here  
Time to be alone  
I've found a space where I belong  
Not succumb to fear  
  
'cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss  
'cause everyday is all there is  
In my some kind of bliss

Someday,  
Someday,  
Precious stone,  
Life goes on,  
You have abused and used me,  
Now I'm going home,  
I want my records back,  
To get my heart on track,  
You think I can't be alone,  
Well this woman's here to show you,  
Oh, Someday  
  
The lights will fall and you will know,  
If you do it slowly,  
You might just find it's worth it all,  
Precious stone,  
Life goes on  
  
You feel used and abused,  
Now you're all alone,  
How dare you say,  
I will be back one day,  
You've taken me for granted,  
It's time for me to say  
  
Someday he'll be there to hold you baby,  
There by the grace a sign,  
Someday he'll be there to dry your tears,  
I want my records back,  
To get my heart on track  
  
You think I can't be alone,  
Well this woman's here to show you,  
Oh, How dare you say,  
I will be back one day,  
You've taken me for granted,  
You need to find your way.

I want you to remember  
First kiss you ever had  
When our lips met together  
I knew that was that  
  
I'm still standing  
Keeping you dancing yeah,  
You know you want it  
I'm still going  
Making the party blow  
The way you like it  
  
Do you want to hear me sing pop  
'cause I don't think I want to stop  
And I love it when my beats drop  
Yeah it makes me feel hot  
Guess whose back on top  
  
I'll happily surrender  
To your desire  
A touch so warm and tender  
Is setting me on fire

Making the party blow

And I love it when my beats drop

Never would say  
I never need anyone  
Not now I have knowing  
Of the real love  
And I need to have you  
I could never give it up  
'Cause the hurt would be too much  
And the feeling I'm feeling  
Is a feeling I like  
It's only when I'm with you  
That I feel all right  
I'm amazed that it's come to this  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
Ooh, falling into you  
I've fallen on my feet  
My world was only turnin'  
So that we could meet  
And I want you always  
I could never run away  
Workin' destiny today  
And the givin' I'm givin'  
Is a givin' I like  
It's easy when I'm with you  
To give into life  
I'm amazed that it's come to this  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
I love you to tears  
Happier than high, this is happening  
So cool to have this salt water on my skin  
It's not a pool of sorrow that I'm harbouring  
These are tears of joy that I'm swimming in  
Happier than high, this is happening  
So cool to have this salt water on my skin  
It's not a pool of sorrow that I'm harbouring  
These are tears of joy that I'm swimming in  
Happier than high

I love you to tears  
I love you to tears
