Sittin' around, waiting for an airplane  
Don't know how to fly, but that's okay  
Got me a pilot, she's going my way  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings  
  
Sittin' around, waiting for the mailman  
I don't how he could be so slow  
My good friend said you wrote me a letter  
Must have been a year ago  
  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
  
Sittin' around, watching the rainfall  
I don't know how it could rain so long  
They say the ocean, she is a woman  
Who waits for her man to come home  
  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving on  
Well, I've got a feeling  
That I should be leaving  
  
Sittin' around, waiting for an airplane  
Don't know how to fly, but that's okay  
I got me a pilot, she's going my way  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings  
If she's got wings, if she's got wings  
  
  

Half a mile from the county fair and the rain came pouring down  
Me and billy were standing there we had a sliver half of crown  
Our arms are full of fishing rods had the tackle on our backs  
We just stood there gettin' wet with our backs against the fence  
  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
I hope it don't rain all day  
  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll  
Well it stoned me  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like going home, going home  
  
Rain let up and the sun came up we were getting dry  
Almost let a pickup truck nearly pass us by  
Well we jumped right in and the driver grinned and he dropped us up the road  
We saw the swing and we jumped right in not to mention the fishing poles  
  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Let it run all over me  
  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll, stoned me  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like going home, and a jelly roll  
  
On the way back home we sang a song our throats were getting dry  
We saw a man from across the road he had the sunset in his eyes  
He lived all alone in his own little home he had a great big gallon jar  
There were bottles two, one for me and you and he said, "hey there you are"  
  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
Oh the water  
I get it myself from the mountain stream  
  
It stones me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll, stoned me  
It stoned me to my soul  
It stoned me just like jelly roll  
  
It stoned me  
Just like jelly roll  
I'm coming home  
It stoned me just like going home

Help me mama, for I have grinned  
Save me daddy from where I'm goin'  
Call out to me from the ages beyond  
Help me remember how to be good  
  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
  
Help me granddaddy to see the swans  
Strike me granny with your golden pump  
Teach me now what I could never learn before  
  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I feel I really shouldn't  
  
Teach me Great Uncle to hear the talk  
Show me Aunt Avis with your ageless chalk  
Scratch it out for me on my cloudy retina  
  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I know I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good  
How to continue when I know I really shouldn't  
How to remember how to be good

Funnin' round Grandpa's farm  
Really groovin' on the baby pigs  
Oh, I know they haven't even read the books I know  
Yeah, I understand the telephone  
But I really love to watch you talk your talk  
I love to watch you  
  
Maybe we're better off  
I feel young dancing with you  
  
It happened all by itself  
  
What are we browning here for?  
Haven't we seen through this whole thing yet  
Gonna get together gonna write us a book  
Call it, 'Stop Running The World'  
Look like I'm back in business all over again  
  
Maybe we're better off  
Looking at you, looking at you there  
  
Little better, it happened all by itself  
  
I see that time is fast  
I see the same hands on that same clock move  
Way too slow  
I'll quit talking about mys  
I swear I'll quit talking about myself  
Maybe you can whisper enough here  
So I can start thinking about you  
  
Maybe we're better off  
Sure right looking at you  
  
Let's not confuse association  
Something we both really like  
I swear I quit talking  
I swear I quit talking about myself  
Just as soon as I learn to stop talking at all  
  
It would be better off  
Just feel you thinking about you ?  
  
Maybe we're better off  
Feel good looking at you

We sat on the couch a playin'  
Touch the tongue and bump the table  
But I was scorned after little ado  
Tossed right out into the blue  
  
I set into a downward spiral  
Caught an illness that was literally viral  
I heard some words of wisdom the other day  
And they went in one ear and out the other one  
  
I awoke from this beatific binge  
With prismatic eyes, now lite is tinged  
With all the vapors that the vile humans brew  
Shining through the blight of you  
Shining through the blight of you  
Shining through the blight of you

Oh, Pappy left a chair like he's still sittin' there  
Once I almost saw him make his move  
Brave Indian who never changes his mood  
In a painting on the wall right there  
  
Oh, how long 'til the morning wakes  
Oh, how long 'til the medicine takes  
  
Oh, Sally buffalo in the apartment just below  
Just a bein' without a care  
Oh, children from my brood they come and bring me food  
Maybe open up a window for air  
  
Oh, just now I smell the cornbread bake  
Oh, now, now, now I feel the medicine take  
  
Just like home  
Where the stray dogs go through it all  
Still right here, still just here,  
Brave little friend  
  
Well, we got a party goin' on many spirits strong  
Ain't preacher just a happy to meet ya  
Half a bottle 'neath the bed keep our spirits fed  
My hat's off to you, to you and you  
  
And now our brave friends, too, dancing circles through the room  
And a broom and a radio and a twistin out a dos-e-do  
Brand new day, the whole world's goin'  
Whole room's goin' so  
  
Just now, don't hesitate (hesitate)  
Oh, taste the morning break (morning break)  
Sweet, sweet, young honeycomb (honeycomb)  
On, now, now, now just like home (just like home)  
  
Oh, just like, just like home  
Where the stray dogs go  
Oh, oh, rest my bones  
Like a fresh skipped stone to it all  
  
Still right here, still just here,  
Still just here, brave, brave friend

I've been working all day  
I've been shaking it loose  
It's been raining for hours  
I've been spilling my juice  
Nothing means nothing  
I couldn't care less  
And now that you're gone,  
I can't even guess  
I've got snakes in my cellar  
I've got blood in my bed  
Bombs in the closet  
They're all painted cherry red  
And a feel like a mad scientist  
I've got loose change in my head  
Nothing but trouble these days  
I eat bullets in my bread  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Violent romantic  
On a seven day binge  
Losin' a gamble  
But I get my revenge  
Start thinking about thunder  
And I get mad again  
Soaking up electricity  
Like bourbon and gin  
  
Now that you're gone  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't get right  
  
Hallucinated green light  
And I slammed on the gas  
My performance ain't perfect  
But it's loud and it's fast  
Set sail for the new world  
And I burned down the mast  
Well, it wasn't the first time  
And I know it won't be the last  
  
Now that you're gone, honey,  
I'm sober every night  
I can't get high - no -  
I can't - get - right  
Get right  
  

The Cadillacs roll, Katie step to the side  
Tellin' jokes with strangers  
A kind glance at a lonely passer-by  
Jingle bells, electric lights  
Oh, they rattle 'gainst the shopping cart  
Even on the fourth of July  
  
Christmas Katie calls people names  
They're Dancers, and Blitzens, and angels on high  
  
Chilly bones laughin' after the night  
Oh, the hungries come and go  
As he blows with his eyes froze tight  
Slidell boy, big city nights  
Oh, he tips his hat for dinner  
An old stray beggin' for a bite  
  
Oh, Christmas Katie, babe, blow your horn  
Play something happy, leave the sad one's alone  
Crackin' a smile as small as wishes  
Make us some merry, make it last for a while  
  
Hey, puttin' out the dog, put the wheels on tight  
Oh, play another sweet song  
Never want to see Katie cry  
Jingle bells, electric lights  
They rattle 'gainst the shopping cart  
Even on the fourth of July  
  
Oh, Christmas Katie, baby blow that horn  
Play something happy, leave the sad ones alone  
Slidell smiles as small as wishin'  
Make us some merry, make it last for a while  
Oh, make it last all night!

Right where you are standing  
The dinosaurs did a dance  
The indians told a story  
Now it has come to pass  
  
The Indians had a legend  
The Spaniards lived for gold  
The white man came and killed them  
But they haven't really gone  
  
[Chorus]  
We live in the city of dreams  
We drive on the highway of fire  
Should we awake  
And find it gone  
Remember this, our favorite town  
  
From Germany and Europe  
And Southern U.S.A.  
They made this little town here  
That we live in to this day  
  
The children of the white man  
Saw Indians on TV  
And heard about the legend  
How their city was a dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The Civil War is over  
And World War One and Two  
If we can live together  
The dream it might come true  
  
Underneath the concrete  
The dream is still alive  
A hundred million lifetimes  
A world that never dies  
  
[Chorus]

Conrad the Caterpillar thought he was really killer,  
Couldn't wait to build a cocoon (original lyrics)  
Couldn't wait to buy blue suede shoes (recent lyrics)  
Spent all his days eatin' leaves in the shade  
And stayed when the night set, too.  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew life would be a thriller  
Soon as the threads was spun  
Wouldn't stop to play in the Caterpillar Games  
Till his own webbing game was done.  
  
He said, "No, no, I got no time to play,  
Got a thousand little legs that don't get me too far in a day,  
I'm leaving, looks like I can't stay."  
  
That little pillar he found him a willow  
Spun in with a craftsmans weave  
Wound so tightly to protect him from the light  
And all shapes of water that drop from the leaves  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew he would be a chiller  
And he wound it tighter some more  
Wound it so wide and the ends of his legs got sore.  
  
He said, "No, now I can't feel my feet  
Just when I thought it was time to take a stroll on down the street  
I'm leaving, looks like I can't leave  
What do you know?  
What's all this moving around with inside me?  
  
What kind of 'piller could touch the world of a miller  
Chopping trees to build a new store  
Nobody sees a lonely bump on the tree  
Except a lump who's crying for more  
Conrad the Caterpillar knew life would be a chiller as he wound it tighter
some more  
Anybody stands in the caterpillar's place is moving in a standing run  
  
He said, "No brother, I just need some room to fly,  
I spent all of my days just trying to keep dry  
Oh I'd take a waterfall or a drop from my eye  
I can't see nothin' from here anyway, I might as well make room and try  
Might as well try  
  
Oh no, I just need a little room to play  
Got a thousand little wings and I'm gonna use them all today  
I'm leaving, it looks like I gotta stay.

Remember watching children play  
Ring-around-the roses  
Tiny electrons circling in neutral ground  
So much gravity, in gravity  
  
Boys in bars, they stir their drinks  
Clockwise while the ladies dance  
Bodies and thoughts constantly in motion  
Oh, what a time to think of mom  
Counting train cars  
  
This is a place called paradise  
Make the fist that holds the paintbrush  
Take your open hand and roll the dice  
The trains will pass and the pups will rush  
  
Walk outside, stare down the sky  
Stars are fixed and so am I  
Grand illusions constantly in motion  
Oh what a time for gravity, counting train cars  
  
Another day in paradise  
Counting train cars  
Another day of gravity  
Counting train cars

Beautiful, the girl's cooking in the diner today  
Oh, she won't show the bother, even time she gets covered in blues  
I sing kind little songs  
Trying to bait her soul  
And she's like natural music  
Anyway she moves  
  
Oh in time, time, time, I just love to watch her hands move  
A little sugar, pepper, little brother wants to shine my shoes  
Go ahead, shine, shine, shine, I'll sit real still  
And my backbone shivers as she looks this way  
And I try not to move  
  
She's beautiful, natural  
Hangin in the diner basking in the light of Ms. Lee  
  
Given time, Lord I'd build her a mountain for a room.  
Given an hour, an hour, I'd build a rocket to the moon.  
Might take at least a week to find the strongest tool  
Might take the rest of this lifetime to find the strongest fuel  
  
But she natural, she take the moon and put it in her pocket  
She's beautiful, smiling it on me while I build this rocket  
  
Because the tongue tastes so old, can't even load you coffee sweet  
When she serves a bowl of lightning, makes sure you get all you need  
Sometimes come for a menu, some just come in to breathe  
Hanging in the diner sitting in the light of Ms. Lee  
  
She's beautiful, natural  
Hanging in the diner, basking in the light, basking in the light  
  
She's beauty, yeah, the girl's cooking in the diner today  
No, she won't show the bother, even time she gets covered in blues  
I sing comical songs trying to blame myself  
She's all-ready music in a booth, man, if she catch you  
  
Hanging in the diner  
Sitting in the light of Ms. Lee  
Opening up early  
Help a poor boy up  
Open on Sunday, all day  
Little sunshine rising from the park  
Cross the street to the path  
Keeping my teeth long and longer  
And a smile  
  
Hanging in the light  
Hanging in the light  
Sister  
Sister

As a boy I had a gig with a travelin' show  
Way back in '63  
We did a little pickin' for the soldier boys  
Of General Bobby Lee  
  
But when we got to Pennsylvania,  
I knew there'd be a change  
We caught up with some boys from Georgia  
And I heard one of them say  
  
Don't tell the band  
The devil's on his way  
Don't tell the band  
Just let the music play  
  
Later on I had a job pouring gin and rum  
On the grand queen of the sea  
We set out on our first transatlantic voyage  
Headed for New York City  
  
But when I felt that lady shudder  
I knew there'd be a change  
I saw the captain grab the first mate  
And I thought I heard him say  
  
Don't tell the band  
The devil's on his way  
Don't tell the band  
Just let the music play  
Just let the music play  
  
In the Restaurant at the End of the Universe  
In the year 3010  
I was listenin' to the Good Old Interstellar Boys  
Playin' "Let It Be" again  
  
But when I heard the trumpet sounding  
I knew there'd be a change  
A prophet wearin' robes appeared before us  
And he looked at me and said  
  
Don't tell the band  
The devil's on his way  
Don't tell the band  
Just let the music play  
  
Don't tell the band  
The devil's on his way  
Don't tell the band  
Just let the music play  
Just let the music play  
Just let the music play

Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
  
You know, I can't see straight  
And I'm feelin' dizzy  
  
I can't feel my face  
Against the hard wood floor  
  
I'm gonna tell you right now  
I guess our very last day  
I'm afraid for my life  
'Cause I would lose you  
  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
  
I had dreams last night  
While you still were sleeping  
I can see my faith  
Runnin' out the backdoor  
I'm going to tell you right now  
Like it's the very last day  
  
And I'm afraid for my life  
'Cause I will lose you  
  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
  
I'm gonna tell you right now  
I guess our very last day  
I'm afraid for my life  
'Cause I would lose you  
  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you  
Don't wanna lose you right now  
Don't wanna lose you

Take along some of your favorite things  
'Cause you're gonna need 'em  
Wait right here  
Wait 'til I come back around  
You and I will go  
We'll just sit and watch it all go down  
Down Down  
  
I was fakin'  
While you waited for change to come  
I lied when I said I couldn't stay here anymore  
When you and I just can't seem to get along  
You and I both know  
We'll just wait until it all calms down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
  
Careful of the things you want to say  
'Cause you're gonna mean 'em  
Break my pride  
My backbone is feelin' strong  
You and I both know  
What we hold would never pull it down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
Down Down  
  
Take along some of your favorite things  
'Cause you're gonna need 'em

The leaves seen through my window pane  
Remind me that it's time to move my life again  
November sun is felt by none  
A chilly breeze has blown my thoughts to what's to come  
A cup of warm coffee, some vitamin see  
A bowl for the cat, a bowl for the dog, a bowl for me  
Choose my bluest tape and unlock my car  
An honest tune with a lingering lead has taken me this far  
  
On the edge of the porch in the warm evening night  
Throwing the bone for the dog I see two passing lights  
Well, I wonder where that driver's bound  
Is there someone, somewhere, someway out there that I've not found  
A touch of smoke ain't what it seems  
Dust and sunshine can also make my eyes look mean  
But there's a brown cat sleeping through this day's show  
Toppin' off the woodpile, breathing slow

So long, baby since you've been gone  
I'm a dyin' man, I'm a dyin' man  
  
Don't ever tell a dyin' man  
You never meant to shoot him down  
Yeah, don't do no good to tell a dyin' man  
You never meant to shoot him down  
Now, all my friends and relatives, they've been tellin' me  
Don't come around, don't come around, don't come around no more  
  
Ever since the day you left this Earth  
Can't keep a job, can't keep a job  
Yeah, ever since the day you left this Earth  
Can't keep a job, can't keep a job  
A lot of people down at the agency been tellin' me  
Don't come around, don't come around, don't come around no more  
  
So long, baby since you've been gone  
I'm a dyin' man, I'm a dyin' man  
So long, baby since you've been gone  
I'm a dyin' man, I'm a dyin' man  
  
Don't ever tell a dyin' man  
You never meant to shoot him down  
Yeah, don't do no good to tell a dyin' man  
You never meant to shoot him down  
Now, all my friends and relatives, they've been tellin' me  
Don't come around, don't come around, don't come around no more  
  
I'm a dyin' man, I'm a dyin' man  
I'm a dyin' man, I'm a dyin' man  
I'm a dyin' man, I'm a dyin' man

I'm a machinist at the Springfield Armory  
Just slightly ahead of my time  
But I don't make much money  
So I sell eggs and chickens on the side  
  
I'm good at what I do  
And I take great pride  
But I don't make much money  
So I sell eggs and chickens on the side  
  
And my wife does love me  
But she can't realize  
Why I won't go back down south  
And leave the armory behind  
  
But I love my job  
I'll shave metal until I die  
And until I do, I'll take on  
Any extra thing it takes to provide  
  
And I know it'll kill me  
Breathing all those fumes  
But I'd sooner sniff solution  
Than a baker's dozen hothouse blooms  
  
And my wife does love me  
But she can't realize  
Why I won't go back down south  
And leave the armory behind  
  
But I feel it is important  
What I do upon my lathe  
I pledge to do the detail work  
Until my expiration day  
  
Until my expiration day  
Until my expiration day  
Until my expiration day

Inspirtation,  
Oh, she barely waits a moment  
Elevator doors open  
Hear her footsteps touch the stairs  
  
Words walk by  
Describing definition  
Stop and talk about it  
  
Narcissus  
Is just too easy to see  
We're always looking  
When we see fishes  
When we go fishin'  
  
Thoughts meander  
Risin' all around us  
Rise and fall and rise again  
Oh, we stop and talk about it  
  
Strong beliefs  
Like ideas come to life  
Turn atoms into rain and stone  
Sands and tall trees  
  
Worlds passed by  
Defyin' description  
Stop and talk about it  
Talk about it  
  
And Maia, she dances  
She dissolves into the light  
Illusions of light  
Oh Maia, she dances  
  
Deep romance and poetry  
Songs and movies  
Virtue for la de da  
She dances in the light  
Dance in the light  
  
Maia, she dances  
Oh Maia, she dances

Four train days  
Get me back to New Orleans  
Drink more fish water there  
Than any whale's mama ever seen  
Alright tonight  
I've been fueling my dreams eatin' greens and beans  
When I get back down there  
I'm gonna drink more fish stew  
Than all the big fishes do  
  
And I still want more  
I still want more  
More  
I still want more  
  
Gimme tonight  
Gonna dream my way on back  
Spend my life down there  
Down on that bourbon street  
Watch my money, and mind my legs down in New Orleans  
Can't tell which men's turns women's there  
And which women's just turns mean  
  
And I still want more  
I still want more  
More  
I still want more

Whoo-wee  
  
I'm so dog gone dirty  
'Cause [I'm] a Flat Foot Flewzy  
And I walk like a Tweety bird  
While I'm singing this bluesy  
  
I gotta gal named Lucy  
But like to call her Lizzy  
She calls her man Flewzy  
And she keeps him real busy  
  
Well, I'm Flat Foot Flewzy, it's alright  
  
"Mr. Flewzy won't tell us bout your big flat feet"  
Why sure, kinda helps me with the rock and roll beat  
Come along with me and things'll be alright  
Singing Flewzy woozy boogie on a Saturday night  
  
Well, I'm so dog gone dirty  
'Cause [I'm] a Flat Foot Flewzy  
And I can walk like a Tweety birdy  
While I'm singing real bluesy  
  
I gotta gal named Lucy  
But like to call her Lizzy  
She calls her man Flewzy  
And she keeps him real busy  
  
Well, I'm Flat Foot Flewzy, it's alright  
  
"Well it's hard to believe that you walk like a bird"  
Well I meant(?) what I said so I said what you heard  
Come along with me and things'll be alright  
Singing Flewzy woozy boogie on a Saturday night  
  
Yeah, Flat Foot Flewzy  
Flat Foot Flewzy, alright  
Flat Foot Flewzy, alright  
Flat Foot Flewzy, alright  
Flat Foot Flewzy, alright  
Flat Foot Flewzy, alright  
Alright  
Flat Foot Flewzy, alright

Black hole, paradise found  
Somthing so dark and something so bright  
Blue skies over our head  
Why the hell is everything turning out gray?  
  
All things are not what they seem  
The man behind the curtain is probably mean  
  
Deep six keeps the population down  
Broke and soaking wet, floating around  
Keep your head down, keep your voice down  
Ohh listen to the sound  
All the races, all the faces  
Just might find a winner lying on the ground  
  
Learn to take it, meditate it  
Can?t fake it now  
From the cradle you?ve been labeled  
About as stable as a drunk on shaky ground  
  
Blind luck stumbling into a tree  
Would?ve passed by if I could have seen  
Got no cares I never felt pressed  
I wonder what they?re getting for a pound of flesh?  
Hunker down now throwing a shoe  
Dogs new tricks Something they can?t use  
  
Deep six keeps the population down  
Broke and soaking wet, floating around  
Keep your head down keep your voice down  
Ohh listen to the sound  
All the faces, you can't shake 'em now now  
Just might find a winner lying on the ground  
  
Learn to take it, try to shake it  
All the faces, you can't shake 'em now now  
From the cradle you?ve been labeled  
About as stable as a drunk on shaky ground  

Gimme a hand there, Michael.  
I'll give you a hand then, too.  
Gimme a hand there, Michael.  
I'd give you my heart if I could.  
  
Throw myself at the ground.  
Look away before I hit.  
  
Give me a lift here, Larry.  
I'll give you a lift here, too.  
Give me a lift here, Larry.  
I'd give you my horse if I could.  
  
Throw myself at the ground.  
Look away before I hit.  
  
Gimme a kiss there, Tuesday.  
I'll give you a kiss there, too.  
I'll give you a kiss there, Tuesday.  
I'd give you my heart,  
I'd give you my heart if I could!  
  
Throw myself at the ground.  
Look away before I hit.

Rain kept pourin' down  
We had places to be  
No funnin' around  
Curiosities  
There were plenty for our heads  
You were somethin' to see  
Do you remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you been hidin' in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
Jokers blowin' around  
Ten-minutemen  
Wasn't nowhere to be found  
Curiosities  
There were plenty for our head  
You were listen' to me  
Do you remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you laughin' in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you laughin' in the closet  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives  
  
Wasn't slowing down  
Fillin' all our needs  
Circus comin' to town  
Generosities  
There were plenty for our heads  
We were something to see  
Remember what he said  
  
I know it may sound funny but  
How dare you show up on time  
I can hear you hidin' in the closet  
I think we better give before he  
Take our life  
  
He said he's in it for the money but  
I guess there's truth in lies  
'Cause it's your favorite charity  
I think we better give before we  
Take our lives

Tonight every word will be spoken easy  
All our stories lead on to fortune and fame  
Rack 'em up and shoot  
But the cue ball is missing  
By tomorrow though, we'll all play different games  
  
Anytime we dance takes us closer to glory  
  
The blue jay flew a little to low down today  
Now that kitty-cat's finally purring out smiles  
Only cry for so long 'til you're just watering stones  
Go full circles crawling all those last miles  
  
Anytime we dance takes us closer to glory  
Anytime we love brings us closer  
  
Our lips just moved closer than ever  
To naming the feelings we've been made of for all these years  
Cliches are frayed teeth trying to feed a hungry old soul  
Words of love, though, will bite back all of those tears  
  
Anytime we dance takes us closer to glory  
Anyway we make love  
Anyway we love  
Take us closer to glory  
Anytime we dance

There's a pack of rabid dogs  
Pawing at my front door  
There's a pack of rabid dogs  
Pawing at my front door  
  
There's a swarm of yellowjackets  
Pounding against my window pane  
There's a swarm of yellowjackets  
Pounding against my window pane  
  
Well, how's it gonna be  
How's it gonna be yeah  
How's it gonna be  
How's it gonna be yeah  
  
All the pictures on the wall  
Have fallen to the ground  
The trees bowing to the grass  
In a silent hurricane  
When the landlord calls  
  
Mother Nature's come to arms  
She's in a fighting mood  
Greta's got a gun  
This ain't no flower child  
  
How's it gonna be  
How's it gonna be yeah  
How's it gonna be  
How's it gonna be yeah  
  
All the pictures on the wall

There's a pack of rabid dogs  
Pawing at my front door  
  
There's a swarm of yellowjackets  
Pounding against my window pane  
There's a big ol' brama bull  
Busting up my shotgun shack

Wide awake in San Diego  
Smallest root shrinking dry  
The fish are swimming closer inside Lake Morena  
Still get no rain from the sky  
Men were firing cannons  
Hoping smoke might tear an angel's eyes  
Heard the stories of shooting arrows  
Tearin' open the clouds  
But Indians shoot the best, and  
The Indians they don't like us, much  
  
Hatfield  
You made rain for L.A.  
We've got ten grand  
For you to go cook us some rain  
  
Science from the cooking pot mixing up with the air  
Feeling thunder  
Nights since they have started  
Now the clouds won't stay apart  
A little California voodoo  
Care of Hatfield and his brother  
Now the horses won't race where the down's turned to mud  
Streams and rivers are growing  
And my boots are filling up  
Water's from back this way  
Look at them smiling, cooking and smiling  
  
Hatfield  
Made rain for L.A.  
Well, "Hot damn",  
People swear with one walk in this rain  
  
Families on porches  
The children are smiling  
The owners are mad, owners are crying  
Still the eyes of the children, wide open  
Wide, wide  
  
Well, the blue light is rolling in between the clouds  
Feeling of wonder  
Some water drying up, some sinking down  
"Charles always kept in touch", swears his mother  
"Always had the touch"  
  
Made rain for L.A.  
Made rain for L.A.  
Hatfield

Johnny let his baby brother sleep  
Through the back door and baseball  
All the kids are waiting outside  
Old days come and go too soon  
Old friends, heroes, lifetimes  
Don't let a single memory fade away  
  
These are the days for heroes  
Look at all the soul shaking life  
Everybody turns hero this time  
  
Feels good to watch a big man dance  
There's a wide smile (wild smell?) on the hot street  
Supper's over and the streets come alive  
The band plays our favorite songs  
Policeman, buy some ice cream  
Sounds different when you hear 'Mister Freeze'  
  
Even the streets carry heroes  
Look at every soul shake its life  
These are the days of heroes, tonight!  
  
Laughter come on downtown window and see faces walking back  
Tonight, everybody gonna remember, remember in time  
  
Brings peace to watch a baby smile  
And the years come  
Bring us new ones  
All that music waiting inside  
  
No, everybody turns hero  
Look at all the soul shaking life  
Everybody turns hero tonight!  
Look at all the soul shaking life  
Look at all the friend shaking life (?)  
Everybody turns hero

Baby born in New York City  
Wrapped in a blanket all tattered and worn  
Mama's doin' the best she can  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
Her eldest son, he stayed in school  
Listened to his mother, he never drank or used  
But every job he wants he gets refused  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
Looking for hope in a hopeless world  
Trying to find love in these hateful times  
Try to stay strong but my mind is weak  
Looking for hope in a hopeless world  
  
Churches are full, but the prayers are not heard  
Saturday's child don't want to to go to Sunday school  
Whatever happened to the golden rule  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
D'you got a quarter for the homeless man  
Spare some change for the soldiers who fought the war  
Put a little money in those hats and those tins  
Give them hope in a hopeless world  
  
Looking for hope in a hopeless world  
Searchin' for love in these hateful times  
Try to stay strong but my mind is weak  
Ease my mind, ease my mind  
  
And on the corner there stands a young girl  
The home she left was in the better part of town  
Daddy did things she never talked about  
It takes hope in a hopeless world  
  
Somebody out there gotta listen  
Somebody out there got to know what Pops been talkin' about  
Raise your hand, raise your hands if you're with me  
Give us hope in a hopeless world  
  
You've got to listen to the voice inside  
Peace and love don't compromise, realize  
Time is passing by  
Can't be standing still!

Some people think they jive me,  
But I know they must be crazy  
Don't see their misfortune,  
I guess they're just too lazy  
Je suie le grand zombie  
My yellow belt of choisen  
Ain't afraid of no tomcat,  
Fill my brains with poison  
  
Walk through the fire,  
Fly through the smoke  
See my enemy,  
At the end of their rope  
Walk on pins and neeedles  
See what they can do  
Walk on guilded splinters  
With the King of the Zulu  
  
Walk to me, get it, come, come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Walk to me, get it, come, come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Till I burn up.  
Till I burn up.  
Till I burn up.  
Till I burn up.  
  
I roll out my coffin  
Drink poison in my chalice  
Pride begins to fade  
And you all feel my malice  
Put gris-gris on your doorstep  
And soon you be in the gutter  
Melt your heart like butter,  
An-an-and I can make you stutter  
  
Walk to me, get it, come, come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Walk to me, get it, come, come  
Walk on guilded splinters  
Till I burn up.  
Till I burn up.  
Till I burn up.  
Till I burn up.

I see what I do, first look at the phone  
Turn on your TV  
Unscrew a bottle of beer,  
An orange square cellophane cheese  
First I think of this, and then I turn to that  
Maybe I just don't think  
Might sing to this, I might sing to that  
If I could only sing  
  
Now, as you can see  
This clearly isn't me  
I'm not alone, I'm just blue  
I'm not alone  
  
There was a day when I was alone  
A few sane days ago  
There was a love I've been living with  
That I lost on the way home  
First I thought of this  
And then I turn to that  
And then I turn a little bit scared  
Well, I feel a little bit easier  
Knowing that you're here  
  
Now, as you can see  
This clearly isn't me  
I'm not alone, I'm just blue  
I'm not alone  
  
First I think of this  
Then I turn to that  
Then I turn a little scared  
I feel a little easier now  
Knowing that you're all here  
  
Now, as you can see  
This clearly isn't me  
I'm not alone, I'm just blue  
I'm not alone  
  
  

My little brother is an insect  
He likes to crawl around his room  
His mother shudders at the sight of him  
His pappy is a businessman  
  
Every move he makes is torture  
He cannot speak words anymore  
Our sister likes to flip him on his back  
And watch little brother squirm  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I don't want to fake it anymore  
  
He took a trip to California  
Strung out on Hollywood and Vine  
The Tinsel-Towners came from miles around  
That little bugger felt at home  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I don't want to fake it anymore  
  
My brother paints a pretty picture  
These things are bad as these things get  
Like dreaming 'bout the Mona Lisa  
And waking up in ruby red  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I don't want to fake it anymore  
  
I really like the way you look in  
Your imitation leather shoes  
And I don't want to fake it anymore  
Anymore  
Anymore  
Anymore

Let's get the show on the road  
At the curtain take a bow  
New Haven just a rendezvous to take you to  
A lover who was then but never now  
  
And Susan paid the lady  
Who called the players' song  
Just a figurine of stagehand reveries  
I guess up-and-coming can't be that wrong  
  
Let's get the show on the road, babe  
The spotlight's on the stage  
Somehow it seems that I heard these words before  
Did you forget to turn the page?  
  
Just remember what they told you  
About how the show goes on  
How can you come back if you've never been away?  
How can you sing without a song?  
  
And today is for sale and it's all you can afford  
Buy your own admission  
The whole things got you bored  
Well the Lord chooses the good ones  
And the bad ones use the Lord  
  
Let's get the show on the road, babe  
Won't you take a look a round?  
It seems so easy climbing to the top  
You better know the way back down  
  
I can't believe you really stumbled  
But I always knew you'd fall  
It seems so easy to say I knew you when  
I'd rather it was not at all  
  
And today is for sale and it's all you can afford  
Buy your own admission  
The whole things got you bored  
Well the Lord chooses the good ones  
And the bad ones use the Lord

Lilly likes Beatles songs  
The words are off, but they don't feel that wrong  
She came in through the bedroom window like a blue girl  
Like a blue girl, like a blue girl  
  
Never has to try too hard  
Her whispered words could mend broken hearts  
Her sundress shines through a hurricane  
Making all boys squeal like swine before her  
  
Hey, Little Lilly,  
Don't believe everything you see  
Hey, Little Lilly,  
Don't believe everything you see  
  
Round and round and round she goes  
Like a sweetheart's girls at the movie show  
Lilly leans back in the very last row  
The lights go low, the show goes on  
  
Even schoolgirls like her way  
Oh, marry the preacher, you'd make a little angel someday  
Silent as a child when the first snows fall  
Perfect player in anyone's own little world  
  
Hey, Little Lilly,  
Don't believe everything you see  
Hey, Little Lilly,  
Don't believe everything you see  
  
Round and round the taxi goes  
Like Shirley's curlies at the movie shows  
Lilly leans back in the very last row  
And the lights go low, the show goes on  
  
Lilly likes Beatles songs  
The words are off, but they don't feel that wrong  
She came in through the bedroom window like a blue girl  
Like a blue girl, like a blue girl  
  
Hey, Little Lilly,  
Don't believe everything you see  
Hey, Little Lilly,  
Don't believe everything you see  
Hey, Little Lilly,  
It's only real if you believe  
It's only real if you believe  
It's only real if you believe

The longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
Every time I hear your voice  
Sweeter is the song  
  
Each glanced borrowed from your eyes  
Deeper is the story  
Wind burns your sleeping breath  
And waters become one.  
  
Longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
  
Your hair brushed me lightly  
Twice before we met  
Years between familiar moments  
Heaven since  
  
Memories like photographs  
Never knew were taken  
Sun drenched snows from separate hills  
Their waters become one  
  
The longer I look at you  
The fairer you become  
  
The longer I look at you  
The fairer

I'm holding the key  
I need no license to ride  
Dad said that I'm alright  
  
The engine's still warm  
She'd been waiting for me in the barn  
Gonna make me feel,  
Gonna make me feel alright  
  
Well I'm bouncin' in my seat  
I try to remember where all the levers are  
I've got enough fuel this time  
I've got enough fuel this time to remember  
  
The engine's still warm  
She's been waiting for me in the barn  
Gonna let me feel, gonna help me feel  
  
Well I'm bouncin' in my seat  
I try to remember where all the levers are  
I've got enough fuel this time  
I've got enough fuel this time to remember  
  
Enter the Earth  
We're scratching our play on the growth of the moon  
Mom said, that I'm alright

I was talking to a homeless drunk about religion  
He said "It's all I got, but it ain't much  
'Cause the way I feel these days,  
I'd rather have a gun than a crutch"  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
  
Listen to a little girl, she was a runaway.  
She said "My daddy treated me like a slave.  
Soiled me in my momma bed when I was just 15.  
That's why I had to lay him in his grave!"  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
  
Talking to a black man from Atlanta.  
He said "The time has come to take what's mine.  
And if I must bust a few heads to achieve justice,  
My righteous cause will well explain the crime!"  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
  
Well, that makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
That makes sense to me  
It makes sense to me, I must confess  
  
  

May your family share laughter  
Your songs always play  
May your wishes come true  
Even those left unprayed  
Hand on my shoulder  
Gentle cloud on the hill  
May your heart's doors be open  
Forever and ever, may your glass, it be filled  
  
Like a wheel to the river  
A mother's moon and sun  
Dreams against the wind  
Oh, and lifetimes undone  
Over and over  
And over again  
I was made stronger  
Forever and ever, knowing you as my friend  
  
On the streams of tomorrow  
Blessed days out swim sorrows  
As we float on reawaked dreams  
  
On the streams of tomorrow  
Blessed days out swim sorrows  
As we float on reawaked dreams  
  
May your family share laughter  
Your songs always play  
May your wishes come true  
Even those left unprayed  
Hand on my shoulder  
Gentle cloud on the hill  
May your heart's doors be open  
Forever and ever, may your glass be filled  

The meeting of the waters makes a sound  
In her eyes, you sit around in your room  
The meeting of the waters raises towns  
Baptized in every drop we found  
  
They can seize us as we are now  
Singin, dancin, in the small town  
Celebrate the days into the night  
Look at me with wild eyes  
  
Leave at home your attitude  
Don't forget to write  
Some things are better left unsaid  
  
Meeting of the waters makes a sound  
In her eyes, you set aground in your room  
Meeting of the waters, raised these towns  
Baptized in every drop we found  
  
They can see us as we are now  
Singin', dancin' in the small town  
Celebrate the days into the night  
Look around with wildest eyes  
  
Leave at home your attitude  
Let's forget the fight  
Some things are better left unsaid  
  
Don't forget to feed the animals  
Lock up for the night  
You know how we both feel about long goodbyes

If we followed your warning signs  
Children would swim alphabetically  
Mountaintops would all fall in line  
Single-file by height  
If this was the only way, daydreaming would stop at 5 o'clock  
And the corner(?) flashes off from left to right  
  
Lies, lies  
You don't always get your way  
  
Saturday, slow to wake, Bugs Bunny love  
Thought those people would never go home, guess it's the price we pay  
If everyday were Saturday  
Oh, most people couldn't even go it alone  
  
Lies, lies  
We don't always get our ways  
  
Oh, and it's time, time to sleep  
Nightdreaming starts with hands held high  
Maybe then we'll finally turn it on  
Like a brand new (?)  
  
Lies, lies  
We don't always get our ways  
Turn it on  
Turn it on  
Gentle  
Fragile

And we're rolling down the windows for this ride  
And there's not much time to take things slow  
We will turn our heads into the sunrise  
As the storms rage in the west  
And we're goin' down to see my lady luck  
  
Now I'm not really interested in telling you my mind  
Just let me drag another before for you go, I'm a broken wire  
Yeah, nobody knows where to find us cause it ain't nobody's loss  
  
And I can't decide if this place is make believe  
And worked all my life to turn sleet to snow  
We will turn our heads into the sunset  
As the storms rage in the east  
And we're goin' down to see my lady luck  
  
Now I'm not really interested in telling you my mind  
Just let me drag another before for you go, I'm a broken wire  
Yeah, nobody knows where to find us cause it ain't nobody's loss  
  
Well, it's nobody's loss  
Nobody's loss  
Nobody's loss  
Nobody's loss

Well, Old Joe, he moves slow  
He likes to look at things and paint pictures on his radio  
He says they make the songs look better.  
  
One day, Joe met a girl  
Sweet breathing thing  
Dancin' naked, nudey, in the winter snow  
Underneath her dozen sweaters  
  
And someday, somewhere  
Some things get hit by lighting  
And some things just don't  
Hope we live long and lucky  
  
At least one things for sure  
Or maybe it isn't.  
No matter where we are  
It's this life that we're livin' in  
  
At least one things for sure  
Or maybe it isn't.  
No matter where we are  
It's this life that we're livin' in  
  
And someday, somewhere  
Some things get hit by lighting  
And some things just don't  
Hope we live long and lucky

Well, One-Arm Steve, yeah he threw me out the door  
Said come back sometime when your picture's on the wall  
Hey now, you got to get on out, got no time to field your problems  
God damn, the repo man, been knocking on the door  
Said sonny won't you walk this line, and put your hands up on the car  
Well, he may not be a talker, but he always knows what's going on  
  
So Sister Ann, she sat my ass up on the table  
Said sit still son, 'cause this won't hurt a bit  
Hey, now she's got a wonder drug for this deaf, dumb, and blind man  
Took me to the hospital, some nurse rolled up my sleeve  
Hey Annie, break my walking stick, and work a miracle on me  
She may not be the doctor, but she always knows what's going on  
  
Well Say Hey Willy Mays, what's in your suitcase full of wonders  
Big city doctor fix me up and make me right  
He said poppin' the devil's pills, will take you straight to hell, boy  
God damn, the reaper man, he just walked through the door  
He said sonny won't you step outside and we can settle on your soul  
Willie Mays is not a toker, but he always knows what's going on  
  
Yeah, he may not be a toker, but he always knows what's going on

Down Poppie Johnny Road, nobody hears your name  
Life that I was lovin', like stealin' a ride on a train  
Wanna steal a ride on a train  
  
Crawlin' in the dirt all night  
I guess this is a place  
Newborns lashed to a dead oak tree  
Settle deeper in the rain  
Settle deeper in the rain  
  
Hold me tight, flying through the air  
Hold on strong, and we're almost there  
Laugh so hard, the devil gets scared  
I got a real good mind to beat your senseless  
  
Best to count your blessing child  
The sun's not too hot today  
Like to get to church before  
Oh, before this old jacket fades  
Take us right to the shade  
  
That's the end of Poppie Johnny Road  
Old blind that cures your misery  
Give her five dollars, boy  
Oh, and a reason to believe  
A reason to believe  
  
Hold me tight, flying through the air  
Coal yards calling, we're almost there  
Laugh so hard and the devil's all scared  
I got a real good mind to beat you senseless  
  
Down Poppie Johnny Road, nobody hears your name  
The life that I love, like stealin' a ride on a train  
Oh, steal a ride on a train  
  
At the end of Poppie Johnny Road  
Old Blind that cures your misery  
Just get five dollars there and a reason to believe  
A reason to believe  
  
Hold me tight, flying through the air  
Coal yards calling, we're almost there  
Laughed so hard and the devil gets scared  
I got a real good mind, to beat you senseless  
  
I got a real good mind  
Senseless  
I got a real good mind  
Senseless  
I got a real good mind  
Senseless  
I got a real good mind

You'll be, hmm-hmm-hmm-hmm, magnet for money  
You'll be, mm-mm-mm-mm, magnet for love  
You'll feel, hmm, light in your body  
Now I'm gonna say, gonna say these words:  
  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
  
It might hmm-mmm-mm-mm, it might rain money  
It might hm-hi-hi-hi, it might rain fire  
Now I'm gonna call, gonna call on Legba.  
Get yourself a sign, Get your love and desire.  
  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
  
Papa Legba,  
Come and open the gate.  
Papa Legba,  
To the city of camps.  
Now, we're your children  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night, in the night  
Come and ride your horse  
  
There is a queen, of six sevens and nines  
Dust in your garden, poison in your mind  
There is a king, that will steal your soul  
Don't let him catch you, don't let him get control.  
  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
Rompiendo la monotonia del tiempo  
  
Papa Legba,  
Come and open the gate.  
Papa Legba,  
To the city of camps.  
Now, we're your children  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night, in the night  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night, in the night  
Come and ride your horse  
In the night, in the night  
Come and ride your horse

Papa's hitting the road again  
Takes the show cross-country for hire  
And the crowds come and go  
Secret agents getting bigger  
Mom's holding sister in the chair  
Turning pages of photographs  
Warm in their memories  
Falling asleep by the fire  
  
To the highway where some new cowboys go  
Drivers and drifters and rouges  
And the crew's still working  
Everybody's cracking jokes  
Morning comes so easy  
Sharing stories and forgetting time  
Take the rest in the look in her eyes  
As they go and close time  
  
Papa's driving past the night  
He's working his way to make it home  
The old man gonna be a sight  
When the morning come, when the morning comes  
  
To the highway where some old cowboys go  
Drivers and drifters and rouges  
Some drink here, some dance here  
Hear old big boy telling jokes  
Mom's holding sister in the chair  
Sharing stories and forgetting time  
Warm in their memories of  
Falling asleep by the fire  
  
Papa's he driving past the night  
He's working his way to make it home  
The old man gonna be a sight  
When the morning come, when the morning comes  
Papa's coming home  
Papa's coming home  
  
Papa coming home

Wake up, come down  
The grass hasn't grown too high  
Well, ease your body down  
If you want to you can unhook your safety line  
Well, ease your body down  
The grass all around us is just green and fine  
  
We've all been waiting  
We've been wondering, will we ever know the truth?  
What it's like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof?  
  
Your reflection's looking clearer  
Now that you're working on a cloudy day  
And those ninth-floor office ladies  
They only hear what your beady little eyes gonna say  
You better wave your hands if you need a breeze  
Better spread real wings if you want to to fly  
You'll remember how to fly tonight in your dreams  
You know you're dreaming  
When there's nothing there worth buying  
  
We've all been waiting  
We've been wondering, will we ever know the truth?  
What it's like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof?  
  
Wake up, leave your body lying there  
It's like another, just another wrinkle in the sheets  
Wake up, I'm gonna poke you if you don't wake up  
You remember how to fly?  
  
We've all been waiting  
We've been wondering, will we ever know the truth?  
What it's like washing windows  
When you know that there are pigeons on the roof?

Black cat crossed our path on little fog feet  
There's crows flying beside my window  
We left superstition on the roadside a few cities ago  
They spent our souls, maybe, but they didn't take our smiles  
  
We listen, we shake, the radio  
  
There's a sweet corn princess smiling through the words on the glass  
Remember we stopped for tamales last time?  
But now the lights from the town are fading with radio  
There's another song playing, and we can hear it in the wind outside  
  
We listen, Pilgrims  
We shake, to the radio  
We listen, to the radio  
  
Little black kitty crossed our path wearing little fog feet  
And the crows they're just drifters through my window  
The late night city's lights are growing sharper  
And I hear another song, I see it pouring from the look in your eyes  
  
We listen,  
We shake, to the radio  
Pilgrims, we listen, we shake, to the radio, the radio

They say turn the bright lights on  
And there you'll find the truth  
Here, open up this book  
And now you'll find the proof  
It feels like a can of worms  
Keep the lid on tight, and they say  
  
Don't let it get too bright  
Don't let it get too bright  
Don't let it get too bright  
No, not this time  
  
They tell me it takes sorrow, boy  
To help you feel the joy  
They say it takes poverty  
To let you love a toy  
Now you can't have the good  
Until you've shared the bad  
  
Don't let it get too sad  
Don't let it get too sad  
Don't let it get too sad  
No, not this time, time  
  
They say it takes hardship, boy  
To let you love the rest  
Sometimes underneath the load  
Is where I show my best  
Go, put your work clothes on  
Go and leave your mark  
And they say  
  
Don't let it get too dark  
Don't let it get too dark  
Don't let it get too dark  
No, not this time

I opened up my eyes to see  
A land of sunny rocks and funny trees  
I guess (Yes,) I'm on the moon again  
A heavy earth exchange a lighter breeze  
Got no coat and got no money  
A pair of tennis shoes to last through May  
A crater for an outdoor pool  
A few good cats to help me pass the day  
  
Havin' a good time, here today  
Watching the sun shine, matinee  
Never the wrong time, time we stay  
Living the moontime, time we play  
  
From here I watch the world go by  
Working in the moon-time bar and grill  
The word from Earth my time is up  
But here upon the moon time stands still  
Got no telecommunications  
Cables haven't gotten out this way  
The man in the moon is a musician  
That's the way we pass the lunar day  
  
Havin' a good time, here today  
Watching the sun shine, matinee  
Never the wrong time, time we stay  
Living the moontime, time we play  
Living the moontime, time to live it up!

Well I've been sittin' here, thinkin' about you  
'Bout what it is that you, you want from me  
You know it seems that I still don't know you well  
Know many faces I have seen  
  
Still I try, to make you happy  
Still I try, to make you sing  
Now if you're wonderin', what I think of it all  
Just read the back of this postcard  
  
The air here, breathing's great  
Lord, we've cooked ourselves  
Now were cookin' up an ass kickin' time (didn't we?)  
  
This town is nuts, my kind of place  
I don't want to leave  
I don't never, never, never, never want to leave.  
I never, never, never, never want to leave  
Never, never  
  
I see you in a  
Thousand costumes  
Strike many a silent pose  
I heard you tell a thousand stories  
Everyone in a different voice  
  
Still I try, to make you happy  
Still I try, to make you sing  
Now if you're wonderin', what I think of it all  
Just read the back of this postcard  
  
The air here, breathing's great  
Lord, we've cooked ourselves  
Now were cookin' up an ass kickin' time (didn't we?)  
  
This town is nuts, my kind of place  
I don't want to leave  
I don't never, never, never, never want to leave.  
I never, never, never, never want to leave  
Never, never  
  
I'm taking my car - I never want to leave  
I'm taking my car..

I really wanna move like I'd like to  
Sometimes I remember myself  
I really wanna feel like I'm supposed to  
Sometimes I remember how to feel  
  
How did I find myself just this way  
My body keeps on moving  
But my style gets in my way  
  
Find out just how tall I am  
By jumping in the middle of a river  
  
Well, we were shaking cliches like we used to  
You just remember the smell  
Breaking my brain like a boy who just  
Can't forget her smell  
  
Now, how do you like the way I drive  
Take us a little bit different way every next time (time)  
  
Find out just how dry I am  
By jumping the middle of a river  
  
Find out just how tall I am  
How tall I am  
  
I really wanna move like I'd like to  
Sometimes I remember myself  
I really wanna feel like I'm supposed to  
Sometimes I remember how to feel  
  
How did I find myself just this way  
My body keeps moving  
But my thoughts get in the way  
  
Find out just how tall I am  
By jumping in the middle  
  
  

Always been the radio's child  
Quick-to-smile precious baby  
Search the dial and electrify  
  
Drive a tight little corner back in the mirror  
Radio boys trying on all their moves  
Spare some change and testify  
  
Radio playing in your sleep  
Prophet waiting in your car  
Worlds whispered in the mind of a radio child  
  
Rhymes cheating keeping time  
Eyes stretching across the stars  
Over and over in the life of a radio child  
  
The radios laugh like all their friends  
Telling jokes the old folks know so well  
Like an old guitar plays a lullaby  
  
Radio cradling your dreams  
Prophet waiting in your car  
Worlds whisper in the mind of a radio child  
  
Rhymes chatting keeping time  
Eyes searching across the stars  
Over and over in the life of a radio child  
  
Yeah radio child  
Precious baby, precious baby

Be strong, baby please be strong  
Won't last, baby won't last long  
We were happy in our home  
  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
  
Take care, baby please take care  
Somewhere, find yourself a prayer  
We were happy in our home  
  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
  
Be strong, baby please be strong  
Won't last, baby won't last long  
We were happy in our home  
  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high  
Raise the roof, raise the roof, raise it high

Rebirtha strolling 'cross the street  
Juggling keys to a small red car  
Butterflies and bombs fly close  
Like she's some Disney movie star  
  
Sipping hopes and loneliness  
Since the big leagues left us dry  
Birtha, rebirtha sing a sad song  
Soothe these troubled times  
  
First time  
It's not the first time  
Last time  
No, I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past life  
Or maybe it was just last night  
I don't know  
  
Birtha never sang too well  
But her stereo shook glass  
Leather gripped our bodies  
As her toes curled around the gas  
  
Shaking loose out of Kansas  
First twenty minutes in black-and-white  
Birtha, rebirtha, talk to me, take to me  
Ease these troubled times  
  
Won't ever talk too much  
She had those television eyes  
My gaze never strayed too much  
Too much past those eyes  
  
She said, "I know a town where real life's a game  
Baseball's all that's real  
At night all the faces light up  
As the players take the field"  
  
First time  
It's not the first time  
Last time  
No, I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past time  
Maybe it was just last night  
Don't just know  
  
Rebirtha strolling across the street  
Juggling keys to a small red car  
Butterflies and bums fly close  
Like she's some Disney movie star  
  
Sippin' hopes and loneliness  
Since the big leagues left us dry  
Birtha, rebirtha, sweet-talk talk 'em  
Soothe these troubled times  
  
Birtha never ever talked too much  
Had those television eyes  
Said, "We act like what we watch  
Like what we act out most the time"  
  
"Gonna take you to a town  
Where real life's a game  
Baseball is really real  
At night all the spirits lighten up  
As the heroes take the hill"  
  
First time  
It's not the first time  
No, I know I seen your place before  
Maybe in a past time  
Maybe it was just last night  
I don't know

Red hot mama from Louisiana  
Thumbin' her way to Savannah  
She been cooped up too long  
  
Red hot mama lookin' to the city  
Taxi dancers and big time spenders  
She's been groovin'  
  
Red hot mama was gettin' down  
Scoping the places where fun to be found  
She was smokin'  
  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
  
Red hot mama was really bad  
She was badder than bad, bad as she want to be  
  
Red hot mama was a real gas  
Doin' it good and doing it fast  
She was smokin'  
  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me  
Ride on, red hot mama  
Girl, you sure look good to me

This is the season  
These are the waking days  
Throw off your wet sheets  
Step into the Soft Parade  
Hollowed and glisten  
Like sweat on a moving train  
Baby, listen  
We're about to be born again  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears you hide away  
Maybe it's a burden  
Or maybe it's nature's gift  
The stretch and the burn  
All the colors you're working with  
This is a cleaning  
These are the shapes we've taken in  
Real life our dreaming  
This is our second skin  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears and pride today  
This is just another story  
Whisper the walk you walk  
Magic and glory  
This is just flesh from talk  
This is a moment  
This is the time to choose  
This is your hour  
Nothing but skin to lose  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears you hide away  
Come down  
This is your second skin  
Surround  
This is your second skin  
This is the love inside  
These are your fears and pride today  

While you're out there on the highway  
While you're driving roll on by  
Going south between the bridges  
While the river running dry  
And if you can't come home  
Please send your mind  
  
Well now you're talking  
Where are you going  
On the train that just rolls  
Across the nation past the station  
And the night is as black as coal  
And if you can't come home  
Please send your mind  
  
Are you healing on your heartbeat?  
Are you heading between the sheet  
And the signs from the lamppost  
On the corner of the street  
And if you can't come home  
Please send your mind  
  
Send your mind, please, little darling,  
Little darling, send your mind  
Send a little money too  
Little darling, send your mind  
I'm coming home

A little wrangler was born  
I seen him squirming in the saddle all wet and warm  
He's such a changeable form in his very first year  
  
He rides on to wrangler school  
With a slingshot and a saddlebag of hand-me-down tools  
Doesn't want to look like a fool  
Pass the jail without tears  
  
Time machines, remembered scenes  
That a wrangler rides through a passing stream  
Time's replaced by a peaceful dream  
Wrangler space  
  
He reigns his pony to the gate of the school  
Feather pens and inkwells of hand-me-down rules  
Like trading a pony for an aging mule  
He rides away without fear  
  
Time machines, new routines  
That a wrangler rides through a passing dream  
And time's replaced by a peaceful stream  
Space wrangler space  
  
He gets off at a stranger's place  
Where the girls dance different with familiar grace  
He's knowing that he found the place  
That pours the coldest beer  
  
Skol, very cold beer  
Cheers, to your friends so near  
High, your dreams so clear  
Raise another glass to the dreams so near

Used to ride the highway  
I used to know where I was going  
Now this shady dirt road is feelin' cool beneath my feet  
Used to ride on  
To get to where I was going in a day  
Now I've got to stop  
And go and stop and go along the way  
  
Was a fool to waste my time  
Just searchin' my mind  
But the more I find  
The more I find the time to search  
Used to ride on  
To get to where I was going in a daze  
And now I've got to stop  
And go and stop and go along the way

Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly  
Travelin' Light, just you and I  
Way on down to ecstasy  
Way on down and our own way  
Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly  
  
Travelin' Light, and you can catch the wind  
Travelin' Light, better let your mind pretend  
Get on down to paradise  
Maybe once, now maybe twice  
Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly  
  
Get on down to paradise  
Maybe once, now maybe twice  
Travelin' Light, is the only way to fly

Been thinkin' all day  
Packin' my car  
With this baggage of mine  
I wouldn't get too far  
  
Stored away on a bus  
No need to hide  
I'm slowing down  
Catchin' one last ride  
  
Been feelin' alright  
For a couple of days  
Either in a fog  
Or a sunny haze  
  
Got a big hole  
In my deflector screen  
What I really need  
Warp nine, Geordi, please  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road  
Wanna carry my life in a bag  
Like to live in a hotel room  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road  
Wanna carry my life in a bag  
Like to live in a hotel room  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
  
I'm down the road  
Somewhere in between  
Been thinkin' about  
What's underneath  
  
It's all in my mind  
I got a brand new start  
All I can do  
Is take care of my heart  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road  
Wanna carry my life in a bag  
Like to live in a hotel room  
Wanna be a travelin' man  
  
Wanna keep my eyes on the road

My friends  
Feel its their appointed duty  
They keep trying to tell me  
All you want to do is use me  
Oh, but my answer  
To all that use me stuff  
I want to spread the news  
That if it feels this good getting used  
You just keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
My brother  
He sat me right down and he talked to me  
Oh, he told me  
That I ought to not let you just walk on me  
And I'm sure he meant well  
Yeah, but when our talk was through  
I said brother if you only knew  
You'd wish that you were in my shoes  
You just keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Oh, sometimes  
Yeah, it's true you really do abuse me  
You get me in a crowd of high class people  
And then you act real rude to me  
But, oh, baby, baby, baby  
When you love me I can't get enough!  
I want to spread the news  
That if it feels this good getting used  
Oh, you just keep on using me  
Until you use me up  
Until you use me up  
Talking about you using me  
It all depends on what you do  
It ain't too bad the way you're using me  
'Cause I sure am using you do to the things you do

Baby please, don't turn your back on me  
Let's walk along these cobblestones  
To a simpler time  
And why can't we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby, baby, won't you come my way?  
  
Baby please, why won't you talk to me?  
Seems the more I give the more you cry  
To please you  
And why can't we just take a look around us  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby, baby, won't you come my way?  
Come my way  
  
Sometimes I'm feeling all alone,  
Each place is just an empty space  
And no rhyme or reason I run this stupid human race  
So take all my money and just have yourself a time  
Hope your having a good time  
  
Baby please, don't be so sad today  
Just drive on up to Thacker mountain  
Up to Tennessee  
And why can't we just take a look around us?  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
And why can't we just take a look around us?  
I want to see the things that make you smile  
Like an orphan child on a visiting day  
Baby, baby, won't you come my way?  
Come my way

My name is the Waker  
And I'm bringin' you the morning sun  
I've pushed the old man up forever  
Still I feel I've just begun  
  
I've just begun  
  
My name is treetop  
And I'm higher than you'll ever be  
I'm married to my roots here  
Still I feel like I am free  
  
Feelin' I'm free  
  
My name is blue sky  
And I'm bluer than all of you  
I've watched you run around forever  
Always searching for something new  
  
There's nothing new  
Feelin' I'm free  
I've just begun  
I'm always young  
Love's always new

Walkin' for your love  
Walkin' for your love  
Walkin' for your love  
Walkin' for your love  
  
I'm only going where my eyes are going  
I'm only going where my toes are pointed  
I just bought me this new pair of big shoes  
I'm only going if I can walk there with you  
  
Shinin' for your love  
Shinin' for your love  
Shinin' for your love  
Shinin' for your love  
  
I'm afraid to open my eyes  
I'm even afraid to look at you  
Right here, I'm gonna open my eyes  
I'm gonna move with you  
  
Disappearin' for your love  
Disappearin' for your love  
Disappearin' for your love  
Disappearin' for your love  
  
We're only going in this closet here  
I'm only going if the doorknob turns  
I'm only going if the light goes on  
I'm only going if I can boogie with you

Woman, she's moving to the weight of the world  
Momma, she's carrying the weight of the world  
All the time she breathing in the weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
Bring it on home  
Bring the soup on home  
  
Well, poppa, too, he got the weight of the world  
Man is moving in to the weight of the world  
And all the time, along with the soup he's bringing home  
The weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Children, too, fall to this weight of the world  
All the time they they fall, right there into the weight  
And all the time they're trying to shake  
The weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody's going to the wake of the world  
We're all dressing up fine for the wake of the world  
And everybody's hiding behind trees, breathing loud  
The weight of the world  
  
[Chorus]

I've been working  
'neath The gray sky  
And I'm wonderin'  
Still, I'm wondering why  
Must I lay low  
In a room full of strangers?  
Well, I'm thinking  
Thinking makes the danger  
My emotions they get all tangled up and  
My heart has just turned 'round  
  
Now I'm watching  
Look into my t.v.  
And I'm thinking  
Wondering about the things I see  
And I see your world  
Worthless stranger  
And I get thinking  
Thinking starts and makes it bigger  
All convictions they get all tangled up and  
Our heart has just turned round, round, round again  
  
I've been driving  
Thinking about you and me  
And I'm thinking  
Wonderin' 'bout the things I see  
When you treat your heart  
Hold you like a stranger  
And I've been thinking  
Little thinking makes the danger  
Our intentions they get all tangled up and  
Our hearts have just turned round, round, round again

I've got my cat in the yard  
And I've got my car in the street  
And I've got my nose to the stone  
What I don't have is you  
'Cause I didn't know  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours  
  
I've got my hole in the wall  
Somewhere I can go when the sky begins to fall  
I've got my candles to burn  
What I don't have is you  
'Cause I didn't learn  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours  
  
I've got my CD's to turn  
I've got my lessons to learn  
And I've got my coat for the road  
What I don't have is you  
'Cause I didn't know  
  
I got my way  
And you got yours

Feeling alone but we are here  
Paying the toll for our little world  
Days like these seem to take some time  
When they're over, you will find  
  
Wait for you, see you through  
It's what we've known all this time  
We're taking you to break their rules  
It's what we've done all the while  
  
Put you in this place to change your mind  
Take away things that were your life  
After they've made their example of you  
Their fun is over and you are through  
  
Wait for you, see you through  
It's what we've known all this time  
We're taking you to break their rules  
It's what we've done all the while  
  
Feeling alone but we are here  
Paying the toll for our little world  
Days like these seem to take some time  
When they're over, you will be fine
