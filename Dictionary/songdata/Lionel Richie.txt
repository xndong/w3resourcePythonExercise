I guess I need to say I'm sorry  
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you  
I only wanted just to love you  
But now that were through I can't get over you.  
I didn't mean to write a love song  
I didn't mean to share these feeling I have in my heart  
I told myself I could forget you  
Now I know that's not true, I can't get over you.  
And as I walk down through the halls  
I see your pictures hanging on the walls, those memories  
For all the thing that we've been through  
My heart can still feel me and you  
Sweet memories.  
After the pain of losing you  
After the heartache, I know it's true  
Cause when I saw you, I still can say,  
I'm never gonna love anybody else the way I love you today.  
I guess I need to say I'm sorry  
I didn't mean to make a fool of myself over you  
I only want just to love you  
But now that were through I can't get over you.  
I can't get over you  
I can't get.... over you  
Noooo,  
No, nooo  
Know my heart is breaking baby  
Can't get you out of my mind  
Tried so hard to love you  
Ooooh baby  
Now you gone, now you gone, you gone away  
Got my heart in my hand  
You and me baby  
We got a thing going on  
Ooooh baby  

I know what's on your mind.  
You feel you're wasting time.  
want to talk about it?  
You feel there's something wrong.  
Don't feel like holding on.  
You better think about it.  
You say you jest can't see.  
Don't lay that hurt on me.  
What I'm trying baby.  
Got something on my mind.  
Something I've got to find.  
I'm on the move baby.  
  
[Chorus]  
You see I (can't slow down)  
Got to keep movin' baby (can't slow down)  
No I (can't slow down)  
Oh (can't slow down)  
Got to keep movin' on, oh baby.  
  
I'm out here on the run.  
Trying to get things done.  
Can you hear me baby?  
You think my love's nowhere.  
You think I just don't care.  
Are you kidding baby?  
Don't make me play no games.  
Too hard to just stay sane.  
You know that time won't wait  
Why should I hesitate.  
Got to do it baby.  
  
You see I (can't slow down)  
I got to keep movin' baby (can't slow down)  
No I (can't slow down)  
Can't stop baby, no (can't slow down)  
Got to keep pushin'  
Got to keep movin' on.  
Oh, oh baby, ah, oh, oh baby.  
  
I'm working hard tryin' to pull it together.  
You know I've got to right now.  
'Cause girl I can't quit once I get started,  
I've got to make it somehow  
Ah, (I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin')  
(I got to keep movin', I can't stop)  
(I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin')  
(I got to keep movin', I can't stop)  
Oh,(I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin')  
(I got to keep movin', I can't stop)  
That's right (I got to keep movin', I can't stop movin')  
That's right (I got to keep movin', I can't stop)  
(Can't slow down) [Repeat: x3]  
Oh,(Can't slow down)  
(Can't slow down)  
(Can't slow down)  
Baby  
Ooh girl I'm all fired up.  
Ooh girl I'm all fired up.  
Just can't get enough, girl of it, Ah  
Girl I'm on the one, 'cause I keep on keepin' on.  
Oh yeah, oh.  
You see I (Can't slow down)  
Got to keep movin' baby  
Oh (Can't slow down)  
Ooh, just (Can't slow down)

Can't stop baby (Can't slow down)  
Ooh, alright (Can't slow down)  
Ah running, (Can't slow down)  
Running, running baby (Can't slow down)  
Ooh, (Can't slow down)  
Got to keep movin' (Can't slow down)  
Ooh yeah girl (Can't slow down)

As I was walking down a  
Path in the woods one day I  
Came across a vision that  
Caught my eye  
  
There was a lady standing  
Right there beside a well,  
And I heard her whisper  
What you wish for you can have  
  
Then the vision went away  
I thought that I had lost her  
The girl I had been waiting for  
I can't believe I just saw her  
She is the finest thing, I ever could imagine  
Now I want her next to me, 'cause I want, 'cause I want more  
Whoahhhh  
  
[Chorus]  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
  
She is a gentle flower, she is the sun and rain and  
She could be the reason for my joy and my pain  
The first thing I see each morning, last thing I see at night  
You know if I could have all that  
That's all I wish for in my life  
  
Why did she have to go  
What do I say to find her  
This girl is the only one  
I just cannot deny her  
She's making love to my mind  
And I can't forget this feeling  
It's her voice that's calling  
It's her voice I need  
Whoahhh  
  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
Ohhh Cinderella  
You're all that I want  
You're all that I need  
Come back to me now  
Cinderella  
  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll always cherish  
I ya ya ya ya ya  
Come to me my Cinderella  
Straight to my wishing well and  
You're the one I'll love forever  
I ya ya ya ya ya

Climbing to the top  
I'll tell you anything you want  
We're on this planetary journey to a place beyond  
The independent minds will tell you  
The colors you should wear  
But know the game of life  
Is just a game of solitaire  
  
Climbing to the top  
The ones you love will come and go  
When you lose you sacrifice  
Chasing the rainbow  
And if you should climb this magic ladder  
The story will unfold  
Just remember when you reach the top  
All that glitters is not gold  
  
Time, just take the time  
What you think is what you find  
You know the answers  
You're no ordinary dancer  
Face the changes you go through  
Have the faith in what you do  
You know the answers  
You're no ordinary dancer  
  
Climbing to the top  
I'll tell you anything you want  
Were on this planetary journey  
To a place beyond  
You can climb the highest mountain  
Swim the deepest seas  
The only thing that matters  
Is you will find your destiny  
  
You know the answers  
You're no ordinary dancer  
  
Climbing to the top  
I'll tell you anything you want  
You're on an imaginary journey  
To a place beyond  
You can climb the highest mountain  
Swim the deepest seas  
The only thing that matters  
Is you will find your destiny

One kiss, intrigue  
You're all alone with me  
So much, delight  
I want to be with you tonight  
Champagne, caviar  
One moon under the stars  
One look, I'm sure  
I only wanted to be with you  
  
Girl I knew  
When you walked into the room  
There was nothing I could say  
You took my breath away  
So much love  
So much passion in the air  
When I looked into your eyes  
I realized  
  
Tell me now  
Am I feeling what I'm feeling  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
And it will not fade away  
Only you could be  
My one love forever  
Just tell me you'll stay  
And the two of us will dance the night away  
  
We'll dance the night away  
Soft lights, romance  
We talked, and then we danced  
I held you close to me  
Girl, you are my ecstasy  
Your lips, and your hair  
The way you touch me, girl I swear  
Only you could take me there  
I had to be your lover  
  
You're the one, you're the only one  
And it feels so good to me  
It's like destiny  
'Cause in my mind, in my heart and soul  
I believe the time is right  
To just let go  
  
Tell me now  
Am I feeling what I'm feeling  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
And it will not fade away  
Only you could be  
My one love forever  
Just tell me you'll stay  
And the two of us will dance the night away  
  
We'll dance the night away  
Girl I knew  
When you walked into the room  
There was nothing I could say  
You took my breath away  
So much love  
So much passion in the air  
Just to look into your eyes  
I realized  
  
Tell me now  
Am I feeling what I'm feeling  
'Cause my heart's on fire  
And it will not fade away  
Only you could be  
My one love forever  
Just tell me you'll stay  
And the two of us will dance the night away  
  
Repeat

What is happening here  
Something's going on that's not quite clear  
Somebody turn on the lights  
We're gonna have a party  
It's starting tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
The room is hot and that's good  
Some of my friends came by from the neighborhood  
The people startin' a climb the walls  
Ooh it looks like everybody is having a ball  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Come on!  
  
Everybody start to lose control  
When the music is right  
If you see somebody hangin' around  
Don't get uptight  
The only thing we want to do tonight  
Is go 'round and 'round  
And turn upside down  
Come on! Let's get down!  
  
So come on! Let's get loose  
Don't hold back  
'Cause ain't no use  
Hard to keep your feet on the ground  
'Cause when we like to party  
We only want to get down  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Say what?  
Can't stop now  
Just getting started  
Everybody clap your hands  
Come on  
Everybody let's dance  
  
(Oh, oh, oh, oh)  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling  
  
Oh, what a feeling  
When we're dancing on the ceiling baby baby  
We gonna dance all night

I belong  
To you, and I'm not  
Confused,  
I don't care  
Where you been,  
And I don't wanna know  
Where you went,  
Girl I need your heart  
I'm right here,  
And I'll try my best  
Not to bring you to tears,  
If your eyes could only see what I see  
Girl you're the best part of me  
  
Girl I'll do whatever it takes  
Say whatever you want me to say,

And I'll love you for forever and a day day day day day day day day day day

Right here as where I wanna be.  
My heart  
Standing still and it'll only beat when you near,  
You may never  
See what I see  
But you're the best part of me

The sun creeps in,  
She says I love you with a smile on her face.  
If time could stand still  
We could lay under the covers all day  
  
She makes this house a home  
In winter keeps me warm  
In summer makes it hot for me  
In the fall and spring fresh loving she brings  
When I open up my eyes she sings  
  
Good morning  
It's a beautiful day  
When I'm with her  
With me she lays  
  
Good morning  
Another beautiful day  
The sun rises  
When I see your face  
Everyday  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Sometimes I wake  
A little grumpy, moody  
She says no way  
Cause she's so positive  
She gives me love  
Gets me ready for my day  
  
She makes this house a home  
In winter keeps me warm  
In summer makes it hot for me  
In the fall and spring fresh loving she brings  
When I open up my eyes she sings  
  
Good morning  
It's a beautiful day  
When I'm with her  
With me she lays  
  
Good morning  
Another beautiful day  
The sun rises  
When I see your face  
Everyday  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
If she cooks your breakfast with love  
Gives you kisses with love  
Rubs your back with love  
Than you better wake up  
Say you (love her)  
Tell her that you (love her)  
Cause every breath that you breathe  
Everyday that you see  
Is not guaranteed  
Oh no  
Every morning  
Every morning  
Tell her  
  
Good morning  
It's a beautiful day  
When I'm with her  
With me she lays  
  
Good morning  
Another beautiful day  
The sun rises  
When I see your face  
Everyday  
Good morning  
Good morning  
Good morning  
  
Tell her good morning  
Good morning

I wanted you for life  
You and me in the wind  
I never thought there'd come a time  
That our story would end  
It's hard to understand  
But I guess I'll have to try  
It's not easy  
To say goodbye  
  
For all the joy we shared  
All that time we had to spend  
Now if I had one wish  
I'd want forever back again  
To look into your eyes  
And hold you when you cry  
It's not easy  
To say goodbye  
  
I can remember all those great times we had  
There were so many memories. Some good, some bad  
Yes and through it all  
These memories will last  
Forever  
  
There' peace in where you are  
Maybe all I need to know  
And if I listen to my heart  
I'll hear your laughter once more  
And so I got to say  
I'm just glad you came my way  
It's not easy to say  
Goodbye

You're the light  
That shooting start that's in the sky  
How did I. Get to be by your side  
I say these words tonight,  
You are my pure daylight  
I want to stay with you,  
And love my life away it's a brand new day  
It seems like heaven  
When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world  
Girl I smile, Cause you let  
Everybeat of my heart  
Feels so right, With you I have  
A brand new start  
Your beauty is in my eyes,  
My heart I can't deny  
I want to stay with you, And love my life away  
It's brand new day  
It feels like heaven, When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world  
Your beauty is in my eyes,  
My heart I can't deny  
I want to stay with you, And love my life away  
It's brand new day  
It feels like heaven, When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world  
It feels like heaven, When I'm laying with you  
It feels so good.There's no angel  
That can compare to you,  
You're not of this world  
  

Here is my heart you can take it  
There's a time in your life for believing  
That impossible dream in your heart  
When you find in one magical moment  
The one you search for from the start  
On a night like tonight when you're holding me  
I can see in your eyes, it's you I've dreamed of  
Here is my heart, you can take it  
Love so strong, can't be wrong  
Here is my heart, please don't break it  
Come what may, here I'll stay  
Here is my heart only for you  
If I gave you the keys of a kingdom  
If I dressed you in diamonds and pearls  
It would never compare to the feeling  
We have together right now  
On a night like tonight, you're everything  
For once in my life, it feels like Heaven  
Here is my heart, you can take it  
Love so strong, can't be wrong  
Here is my heart, please don't break it  
Come what may, here I'll stay  
Here is my heart, only for you  
Here is my heart, now and forever yours  
Making love under the stars  
Paradise is where we are  
Living it up, we'll never stop  
Dancing together  
Round and round and round, we go  
Feel the rhythm in your soul  
Nothing is going to stop us  
When we're dancing together  
All night long forever  
Here is my heart, you can take it  
Here is my heart, please don't break it  
Here is my heart, you can take it  
Love so strong, can't be wrong  
Here is my heart, please don't break it  
Come what may, here I'll stay  
Here is my heart  
Here is my heart  
Love so strong, can't be wrong  
(Come on and take it)  
Here is my heart, please don't break it  
(Come on and take it)  
Come what may, here I'll stay  
Please don't break it  
Don't break it, girl  
Ohh, here is my heart  
Here is my heart  
Now and forever yours  

Every time I see you and I look into your eyes  
There's a feeling that I get  
And it's way down deep inside, girl  
I've been trying to hold on, but you say that you're not sure  
I just hope you realize what my heart is going through  
  
How long, must this feeling go on  
How long, must I stand the pain and  
How long, must this feeling go on  
Waiting for the night  
Waiting for the right time to come  
  
I know all about the hurt and the problems in the past  
I know why your scared of love,  
'Cause you think it just wont last long  
Well, I'm here to tell you what I'm saying is all true  
There ain't nobody else in life  
That can take the place of you  
  
How long, must this feeling go on  
How long, must I stand the pain and  
How long, must this feeling go on  
waiting for the night  
Waiting for the right time to run  
  
Why can't we just run away, and oh run  
A place were we can be alone and nobody finds us, run  
Can we both just run away, and oh run  
Girl I can't wait to have you  
  
How long, must this feeling go on  
How long, must I stand the pain and  
How long, must this feeling go on  
Waiting for the night  
Waiting for the right time to come, to come

I look at you  
You look at me  
(You can't help it you're feeling butterflies)  
It's obvious  
There's some chemistry  
(I think I know why it feels so right)  
Girl, I wanted so long to know  
Now you're telling me you gotta let it go  
(Don't tell me I have to start all over again)  
I never thought this day would come  
(This is something that I've wanted in my life)  
I realize that you're the one  
(And you're telling me it's time to say goodbye)  
What's inside of my heart  
It ain't gonna change  
So it shouldn't be so easy to walk away  
(You feel it, I feel it, let's not pretend)  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, I don't know what love is  
Maybe I'm a fool  
I just know what I'm feeling  
And it's all because of you  
Don't tell me  
I don't know  
I want the truth  
'Cause they call it  
We call it  
You call it  
I call it love  
  
It's so clear for you to see  
(Don't let nobody tell you what to do)  
Why they can't they just let us be happy  
(I don't want to find somebody new)  
If you know what's really in your heart  
Then don't let them tear us apart  
('Cause you feel it, I feel it, let's think this through)  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We have a bond that's unbreakable  
And it's not time to let it go (We're in love)  
And now that we know it's real  
We are going to let it show  
To the whole world  
That I'm yours forever  
And you're my girl  
(You are my girl)  
  
[Chorus x 2]  
  
Love  
They call it love  
I call it love

So many nights thought that I was doing fine  
Thought that time had chased your picture from my mind  
So many times thought my heart was finally strong  
Now I find this heart of mine was so wrong  
I, I thought I'd finally learned to get on with my life  
Then it all comes back  
I hear your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
The way it used to do  
I feel my heart  
(Fall)  
My heart  
(Fall)  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do, I hear your voice  
So many days I thought that I could love again  
But any fool in love would know that's all pretend  
You, you always seem to find your way  
Back in my dreams and I can't break free  
I hear your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
The way it used to do  
I feel my heart  
(Fall)  
My heart  
(Fall)  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do, I hear your voice  
You know I tried so many times  
Just to forget you  
I've tried to walk away from you  
Oh girl, it's just no use  
I hear your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Your voice  
(Call)  
Calling me, calling me the way  
I feel my heart  
(Fall)  
Oh, my heart  
(Fall)  
I try to keep you off my mind  
But every time I do, I hear your voice  
I hear your voice  
I hear your voice  

I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
I still believe there's a reason, there's a meaning to why we're here  
There is a place where we can go to where we don't have to live in fear  
They're trying to tell me that the moon is in the ocean.  
And I'm just dreaming my life away  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer, don't turn away  
'cause I believe in love, that's the only way  
  
I believe in every moment, every heartbeat that we're here  
And we're a part of each other and forever it seems so clear  
I don't believe that I'm just walking in the darkness  
Or that I'm lost without a prayer  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
  
Oh now love is the answer and oh it's right here  
And I know we've got to remember it's only together for now and forever  
  
I still believe in you and me  
Still believe the sun will shine on me  
I still believe true love is the answer  
Don't turn away, 'cause I believe in love  
'cause I believe in love, 'cause I believe in love and that's the only way.

I wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you  
  
Mood's right for love  
And you're the one  
Let's just stand for a while, for a while  
Let's go down  
  
Let's go deep undercover  
Get into each other  
I'll let you choose the style  
And this time, take you down  
  
(Wanna take you down)  
I wanna love you, baby, like nobody ever loved you before  
(Wanna take you down)  
Gonna love you, baby, love you, baby, love  
  
I wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
  
Oh, don't move fast  
Keep it slow, baby, make it last  
Oh, 'cause I feel so around, so around  
Take you down, take you down, take you down  
  
(Wanna take you down)  
I wanna love you, baby, like nobody's ever loved you before  
(Wanna take you down)  
Wanna love you, baby, love you baby, love  
  
I wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you  
  
Get down, get dirty  
My love makes me go, sweet love  
Don't you know?  
Oh, I've been ready  
  
(Wanna take you down)  
Let me love you, baby, like nobody's ever loved you before  
(Wanna take you down)  
Real, real good, baby  
(Wanna take you down)  
I wanna love you, I wanna love you, wanna love you, baby  
  
I wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you  
  
Tell me, tell me, tell me how you feel, baby  
Oh, my baby, my baby, my baby  
Yeah, tell me, tell me how you feel, oh yeah  
Oh, feel good to me, yeah  
  
I wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you down  
Wanna take you down, wanna take you

Hey you  
Where are you going  
You're not leaving me today  
Hey you  
What are you doing  
Put your things down and stay  
You should go, you should leave  
But without you, where would I be  
You can run, you can hide  
Girl, I know I'll never find  
Someone like you  
  
And I owe you like the rain owes dirt  
And I owe you like the love owes hurt  
Heart's like the mob  
And I'm willing to pay you back  
Every dime  
  
I'm into you deep  
Just give me time, a way I'll find  
I'm into you deep  
One more week at least  
I'm into you deep  
Can you take half for now  
I'm into you deep  
I wanna pay you back the love you gave me  
  
Hey you  
What are you doing  
Can't you see, I'm not fighting you today  
Hey you  
What are you saying  
There's no such thing as separate ways  
You should go, you should leave  
But without you, where would I be  
You can run, you can hide  
Girl I know I'll never find  
Someone like you  
  
The love director's calling this a wrap  
And our movie is half way through the credits  
And I just wanna skip the first  
Rewind back to the beginning  
I know my character's been the villain  
And you power of love deserves equal  
Please cast me back in the sequel

Here we are  
Out here me and you  
Reaching out each other  
Is all that we can do  
  
Here we stand  
Trying not to fall  
There's no need to worry  
Love will conquer all  
  
Do you really want to know  
Just how long love will last  
Will all of the bad times pass  
How can we make things right  
  
Ooh and why  
Why is the world so unkind,  
We surely can find peace of mind  
If we only see the light, can't we see that  
  
Here we are  
Out here me and you  
Reaching out each other  
Is all that we can do  
  
Ooh here we stand  
Trying not to fall  
There's no need to worry  
Love will conquer all  
  
Can somebody tell me why  
Why do our dreams go wrong  
Why can't we all belong  
Ooh, where do we start  
Oh and tell me when  
When will we ever learn  
There's nowhere else we can turn  
The truth is in our hearts, here we are together  
Sometimes the road gets hard to travel  
Sometimes the pains too much to bear  
Sometimes when life seems to unravel  
That's the time oh - to say  
We're gonna make it anyway  
Can't we see that  
  
Here we are  
Out here me and you  
Reaching out each other  
Is all that we can do  
  
Here we stand  
Trying not to fall  
There's no need to worry  
Love will conquer all

Are you feeling down, and lonely.  
Feeling like you can't go on.  
Just remember love will find a way.  
  
Tell me are you going through changes.  
Time seems like it's passing by.  
Just believe that love will find a way.  
  
[Chorus]  
I see the tears you cry.  
I see the pain that's in your eyes.  
So many times you were so lonely.  
And no one seemed to care.  
But if your hopes, for your tomorrows.  
Are drowning in your sorrows.  
Know your heart will show you the way.  
  
Are you trying to find a beginning.  
Or something just to hold on to.  
Always know that love will find a way.  
  
Is it hard this life you're living.  
Does the world seem so unkind.  
Don't you worry love will find a way.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some say we've lost, our way.  
Some say the world has gone astray.  
But if you know where you're going.  
There's nothing you can't do.  
'Cause problems will come.  
And they will leave you.  
The world will try to deceive you.  
But the truth will always be in your soul.

Love can have its mysteries  
Some strange, enchanted notion  
You can't explain just how it begins  
A feel, a smile, a potion  
But something goes off in your head  
You can't believe the words you just said  
It's not so hard to see the light  
Lovers at first sight  
When the right one comes along  
There is no hesitation  
You wonder how you lost all control  
It's just a revelation  
And that's the way I felt with you  
One glance was all it took and I knew  
You and I were just so right  
Lovers at first sight  
(Je t'aime beaucoups, mon cherie)  
I love that you love me  
(Jai' envie d'etre pres de toi)  
I want you too  
'Cause when we are together  
There is no place in this world that I'd rather be  
Girl,  
(Dura-t-il pour toujours?)  
Yes, it's forever  
(Est-ce que tu me promets?)  
I promise my cherie  
'Cause you know nothing will change  
The way we're gonna live together  
In our litle fantasy  
Chorus:  
That's the way I felt with you  
One glance was all it took and I knew  
You and I were just so right  
Lovers at first sight  
Fade...  
(Depuis que j'etais un enfant)  
(Je t'aimais)  
(Mais tu ne savais pas que j'existais)  
(Et maintenant que nous sommes ensemble)  
(Tu dis que see'est l'amour do premier coup)  
  

Hey Lucy why don't you come and settle down  
I hear you're the baddest girl this side of town  
Got a little money that I wanna spend  
If you'll be my friend  
For just a little while  
  
First summer you sailed on down to New Orleans  
I was a victor, you were a Cajun queen  
You had many fellas with lots of style  
And you drove them wild  
Oh little Lucy I had to be with you  
  
Traveled around the country  
Oh and I made my way  
I never once forgot what I felt that day  
Now I think I'm ready to play my hand  
I wanna be your man which is hard to do  
Oh Lucy I'm so in love with you  
  
I've been a wandering man for such a long time  
Now I know just where I'm going  
Oh how I need you to stand by my side  
Don't you go away  
Cause I'm so in love with you  
  
I've been searchin' for you Lucy for such a long time  
Now I wanna let you know what I have on my mind  
You've been around a lonely man  
A lonely man  
I've been a lonely man  
Lucy  
I don't want to live my life without you  
There were times when I tried to get you off my mind girl  
You're the girl of my dreams  
Oh you're the girl of my dreams  
Lucy  
(Ahh my Lucy)  
So many lonely nights I need you girl  
(Ahh my Lucy)  

You came in  
That's what my little heart was looking for  
Laughter in the rain  
Feeling like a fool in love again  
  
The laughter came  
When the tears stopped falling  
Now all I do is just call your name  
(When I say lover)  
You walked in and my heart discovered  
That my life would never be the same  
Oh, you are my destiny  
You are my one and only  
You gave back joy to me  
When my whole world was lonely  
Angel in disguise  
With your power of love  
You just hypnotize  
I just love the magic of your spell  
How much joy we'll have together  
Only time will tell  
  
Every day, every night  
Oh, I know it's so right  
When I see your face  
Only time's gonna tell  
But I know you so well  
Girl, my love's for real  
  
From the first time that I saw you  
I know it was forever  
This mighty love between us  
Will keep us together  
You're the girl God sent from heaven  
I'm so glad I found you  
Forever, forever, forever, forever, forever, forever  
I'm so glad to be around you  
You are my destiny  
You are my one and only  
You gave back joy to me  
When my whole world was lonely  
It's alright, it's alright  
Do it again  
It's alright, it's alright  
Don't let this love end  
It's alright, it's alright  
Do it again  
It's alright, it's alright  
Don't let this love end

I've been through so many changes in my life  
It's a wonder I ain't lost my mind  
And I ain't never said how much I need you sugar  
But I sure need you by my side  
  
[Chorus]  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind all the time  
  
Life with me I know for sure it ain't be easy  
But you stayed with me anyway  
And even though you ain't gonna lose too much by leaving  
I'm so glad you stayed  
  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind all the time  
  
You've been my friend and you've been my lover  
Honey you're everything I need  
You've made my love so strong now I know where I belong  
Oh you'll never have to worry  
Oh baby any more, any more  
  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind, oh yeah  
My love, just thinking about you baby  
Just blows my mind, all the time

Leave the station  
Somewhere down in east  
Oh baby, across the nation  
Looking for some fun  
And some hey down hey  
Tell the conductor you're heading  
For the cocktail car  
Yes you are  
That is where I'll be with my sweet  
Ooh, la la, hey  
If you're tired of  
That day after day ride  
And you wanna get off  
All aboard the night train  
Like a smooth alligator  
All aboard the night train  
Such a cool calculator  
All aboard the night train  
Like a smooth operator  
All aboard the night train  
Such a cool calculator  
  
What a beauty  
Listen how the engine wails on the rails  
Sing it to me  
Come and play your tunes  
Up and down my scales  
Such a sweet melody  
I'm just a creature, smile as wide  
As the night is long  
When you're right by my side  
You can never go wrong

Been a long time  
Since I've seen your face  
You've been on my mind  
Like a dream I can't erase  
Time is up now baby  
It's time for me to come home to you  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
Comin' home to you  
Been a long time  
Since last time we made love  
All the things we used to do baby  
All the things that made me fall in love  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
Comin' home to you  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm on the road to heaven  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you baby  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home  
I'm comin' home to you  
I'm comin' home to you baby  
Too long I've been walking around wondering  
Comin' home to you son  
Comin' home girl  
I've been missing you  
I've been missing you  
Yeah, on the road to heaven  

The heart of the city street was beating  
Light from the neons turned the dark to day  
We were too hot to think of sleeping  
We had to get out before the magic got away  
  
[Chorus]  
We were running with the night  
Playing in the shadows  
Just you and I, 'til the morning light  
(We were running, running with the night)  
  
You were looking so good girl, heads were turning  
You and me on the town ooh, we let it all hang out  
The fire was in us, we were burning  
We were gonna go all the way and we never had a doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Bridge]  
We were so in love you and me  
On the boulevard wild and free  
Giving all we got, we laid it down  
Taking every shot, we took the town  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just you and I (we were running)  
We were running with the night  
Playing in the shadows  
Just you and I, girl it was so right (We were running)  
Girl so right (running with the night)  
So right

Sail on down the line  
About half a mile or so  
Don't really want to know where you're going  
  
Maybe once or twice  
Time after time I tried  
To hold on to what we got  
But now you're going  
  
And I don't mind about the things you're gonna sail on  
I give all my money and my time  
I know it's a shame  
But I'm giving you back your name  
Yes, I'll be on my way  
I won't be back to stay  
I guess I'll move along  
I'm looking for a good time  
  
Sail on down the line  
Funny how the time can go  
Friends says they told me so but it doesn't matter  
It was plain to see  
That a small town boy like me  
Just wasn't your cup of tea  
I was wishful thinking  
I gave you my heart and I tried to make you happy  
And you gave me nothing in return  
You know it ain't so hard to say  
Would you please just go away  
I've thrown away the blues  
I'm tired of being used  
I want everyone to know  
I'm looking for a good time  
Good time  
  
Sail on honey  
Good times never felt so good

Say I do I do I do  
Say I do I do I do  
  
Never thought that love could make me fall  
Never thought I needed love at all  
Took me a while to finally realize  
That your love was all I needed to complete my life  
Will you make this sacrifice  
It's hard to believe  
But your love has turned my around  
I can make a commitment now  
  
[Chorus]  
Say I do I do I do  
If you really love me  
Say I do I do I do  
If you wanna be with me  
Say I do I do I do  
Cause I really wanna be with you  
Say I do I do I do  
  
Found myself searchin' what was in my heart  
Scared me when I saw us drifting apart  
Even though I didn't know any other way  
I don't wanna lose you  
I want you to stay  
To complete my life  
Will you make this sacrifice  
It's hard to believe  
That your love has turned me around  
Are you ready for love, I am now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh baby, my lady  
I can't wait to give you my heart  
My lady, sweet lady  
Give me your hand in love  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you want me girl and I want you  
Why don't you say I do I do I do  
If you need me girl like I need you  
Why don't you say I do I do I do  
Surrender  
Forever  
Say I do I do I do

You know sometimes I sit and wonder  
Just how this world would be  
If we had all the people laughing  
And everybody living in harmony  
We'd have to say sela sela  
Talking to the people sela, sela  
  
There would be no more living in desperation  
And no more hatred and deceit  
Tell me, can you imagine  
All the children playing  
And everyone dancing in the street  
We say sela, sela  
Talking to yourself sela, sela  
  
You play it for the people  
Yeah, for the people  
It's time for everyone  
To come together  
I know it's hard  
But this dream must come to light on  
Because tonight should be  
One big celebration  
I'm talking to you now  
Only we can make things right  
  
We say sela, sela, sela, sela baby  
Talk about, sing about, talk about sela  
Talk about sela  
Oh the children  
Tell me about the children  
We've got to help them now to survive  
Well, one world  
One heart is our salvation  
Let us keep the dream alive  
  
We say sela, sela, sela  
I know sela, I know sela, sela, sela ...

You and I were so in love.  
You were all I was thinkin' of.  
There was so much magic in your eyes.  
Then one day you said we were through.  
You said you found somebody new.  
And then you turned and you walked right out the door.  
Baby I told you his love wasn't true.  
You didn't hear me, so now I say these words to you  
  
[Chorus]  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye.  
Now you say you're sorry.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye.  
Baby.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye.  
Now you see who's sorry now.  
Oh, oh,oh.  
  
I remember you standin' there, sayin' to me you didn't care.  
And I was begging baby, please don't go.  
Now you're crying, telling me what went wrong.  
Girl you stayed away too long,  
Can't you see I've got you off my mind.  
(change)  
Thinkin''bout the pain that you put me through.  
I can't help you-because it feels good telling you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(rap) "see mama, what I'm tryin'to say.  
To you is that, I'm ,you know, I love ya,  
But ya - yaa hurt me so bad, I can't take it no more girl,  
I just can't take it, no, hell no"  
  
"no! no, no, I don't wanna hear it,  
Don't say it anymore, don't talk  
No more, I'm tired of you're lyin',  
I'm tired of your cryin' girl, tell  
Me, don't tell me."  
  
(change)  
Thinkin' 'bout the pain that you put me through,  
I can't help you-because it feels good telling you  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
"givin' up on your love girl, never  
Gonna believe you anymore,  
'cause all you wanna do is hurt me, and treat me bad"  
feels good telling you  
  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Girl, I just don't need you  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
All you do is use my love,  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Can't let you hurt me anymore.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Don't say you're sorry baby.  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
Cause your words don't mean a thing  
Serves you right for sayin' good-bye  
It's you who's sorry now

She came on the scene, I felt like I was in a movie, yeah  
She parted the room the way that Moses did the Red Sea, yeah  
And from across the room, I felt her body talking to me, yeah  
'Cause thing about her, thing about her  
Is she is amazing, so amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
No man alive would ever, ever dream of talking to her, yeah  
She gave off a vibe like, come to me, I want to see ya, yeah  
And for whatever reason, I was feeling lucky that day, yeah  
'Cause thing about her, thing about her  
Is she is amazing, so amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing  
She's amazing in the daylight  
She's amazing in the night  
Once you see her  
She's the only thing on your mind, yeah  
She's amazing, she's amazing, she's amazing  
(Talkin' about her fever, every time she walks in to the room)  
She's amazing, she's amazing  
(She's a party girl, she's a party girl, she's a party girl)  
She's amazing, she's amazing  
(Everyone she meets, start dancing in the streets, 'cause she's amazing  
Everyone she meets, start dancing in the streets, 'cause she's amazing)  
She's amazing, she's amazing  
(She's a party girl, she's a party girl, she's a party girl)  
She's amazing  

I've been down so many roads before  
I've seen it all and I've seen a whole lot more  
I never had a feeling like this  
I never lost my heart with one kiss  
I feel it in my heart, feel it in my soul  
Girl, you got me now, got to let you know, I wanna  
  
Shout it to the world  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the world about it  
I've found a love so deep  
Shout it to the world  
Nothing's going to stop us now  
I can't stop loving you  
  
Couldn't believe the magic in your eyes  
One look at you and I was hypnotised  
Don't know how all my dreams came true  
I only know that heaven sent you  
I feel it in my heart  
I feel it in my soul  
Girl, you knock me out, I just wanna lose control  
I've gotta  
  
Shout it to the world  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the World about it  
I've found a love so deep  
Shout it to the World  
Nothing's going to stop us now  
I can't stop loving you  
  
It's so mysterious, I feel delirious, I'm touching the sky  
This thing you're giving me, your spirit's lifting me  
I'm feeling so high  
Can't stop this feeling now, my heart is spinning round  
I'm losing control  
It's like a miracles, It's unbelievable  
I'm ready to go  
  
Shout it to the World  
Sing it to the mountains  
Cause I can't stop loving you  
Take it to the street  
Tell the World about it  
I've found a love so deep  
Shout it to the World  
Nothing's going to stop us now  
I can't stop loving you

She had on these high heels  
And her hair was like a black sea  
She disappeared, before we had a chance to meet  
  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that she's all that I need  
  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
Her beauty stars so bright  
You took me and sucked the breath from me  
Just for a second, she was my sunlight  
Then she fell into the crowd like the band of clouds  
Her darkness fell on me  
  
Oh yeah, I see her, somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that she's all that I need  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
She had on these high heels  
And her hair was like a black sea  
She disappeared before we had a chance to meet  
  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me (please come back to me)  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know that she's all that I need  
  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
  
Counting on my lucky star  
I hope they point me where you are  
I hope, I pray to see your face again  
See there's no doubt that you are mine  
May fate bring me to your eyes  
So I can feel the gift of love again  
  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
Girl, please come back to me (come back to me, come back to me)  
Oh yeah, I see her somewhere in London  
And somehow I know, somehow I know she's all that I need  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah yeah

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, whoa  
  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London  
London, London

People are in confusion  
The world is full of fear  
I see conflict all around us  
Can anybody out there hear  
I hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
  
I see the poor and hungry  
I see the pain they bear  
Where is the hope they long for  
Does anybody out there care  
I hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
  
We all must find one reason  
We all must find one cause  
For everyone to come together  
And give this world a voice  
Can't you hear the people crying  
  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love  
You know we got to  
Stand down so everybody can stand up  
You know it's  
Time for us to show that everybody got to give love

Lady, morning's just a moment away,  
And I'm without you once again.  
You laughed at me, you said you've never needed me,  
I wonder if you need me now.  
We played the games that people play, we made mistakes along the way.  
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.  
Remembering the pain, if I must say, it's deep in my mind and locked away,  
But then most of all, I do love you  
Still.  
  
Those memories, times I'm sure we'll never forget,  
Those feelings we can't put aside.  
For what we had, sometimes I try to understand,  
But it's so heavy on my mind.  
So many dreams that flew away, so many words we didn't say.  
Two people lost in a storm, where did we go, where'd we go?  
Lost what we both had found, you know we let each other down.  
But then most of all, I do love you  
Still.  
  
We played the games that people play,  
We made mistakes along the way.  
Somehow I know deep in my heart, you needed me.  
Cause I needed you so desperately.  
We were too blind to see, but then,  
Most of all, I do love you

Gonna tell you a story  
Bout a love and all its glory  
Every word I say is true  
Every word is meant for you  
  
As I look across the table  
In your eyes I see forever  
Girl there's no one else but you  
No one else will ever do  
  
I'm, I'm, I'm still in love with you  
  
Got my heart so full of laughter  
I finally found what i was after  
Caught an angel flying low  
Now there's one thing you should know  
  
I've been lost and I've been lonely  
Till I found you, one and only  
You're every song I want to sing  
My joy, my everything  
  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm still in love with you  
  
I want you to know just how I feel  
Now that my search for love is over  
Would be alone in life without you  
  
As the years keep getting longer  
It only makes my love grow stronger  
Just can't go another day  
Until I can hear you say  
  
I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm, I'm still in love with you

Just say come on let's be alone babe  
Just say you want to spend some time with me  
Just say anywhere we are  
It's all about love and anything we want to be  
  
Just say you feel the fire burning  
Just say the sun only shines on your face  
Just say this love can last forever  
I want to show you how much I want to know you  
  
There's a dream that I'm dreaming inside my head  
And I know just right where we are going  
Come on and take this ride  
Just come on inside and make this dream reality  
  
Let's both just get away  
Your smile's my holiday  
Don't you know that you're my sweet vacation  
  
Just say just put your heart in my hand  
Just say I'll lay the whole world at your feet  
Just say we're going on a journey  
I can't deny what I'm feeling inside  
  
I see the joy I see the laughter we just don't care  
Happiness will never leave us alone  
You know there's such a place  
A wonderful place where love will find you and me  
Beautifu  
  
Let's both just get away  
Don't you know that you're my sweet vacation  
L  
When I think about you baby  
Whee I talk about you baby  
What I say about you baby  
The world should know about you baby  
Because I really need you baby  
Because I really love you baby  
Because I really miss you baby  
I just want to get away  
  
Let's both just get away  
Your smile's my holiday  
You're my sweet vacation  
Through storms we'll find the stars  
Sometimes they tell us who we are

So I found me a little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She told me don't be so uptight  
She wanna keep up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I found me a pretty little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She says she gonna make things all right  
She wanna keep me up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I'm in Brazil where the scene so fire  
Where the girls and trees can get hotter  
Everything that I see talks to me  
Can't believe how the girls be walking  
  
I've been here about an hour  
They keep saying come talk to me  
I keep thinking there's one and they say us three  
Standing there getting out of the shower  
Turning around showing me the thing got power  
  
Started to converse and I sense a problem  
And I'm thinking girl I can always solve them  
But she didn't want to hear it  
She says she is all mine and I can make him feel it  
All along I was thinking it was gonna be her plus two  
Now they're looking like Lionel the joke's on you  
Next thing I'm feeling is her up and down  
While the girls are watching  
  
So I found me a little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She told me don't be so uptight  
She wanna keep up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I found me a pretty little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She says she gonna make things all right  
She wanna keep me up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I thought there ain't a thing I ain't seen  
Until she pulled out a banner for me  
She said whatever you want  
I know I needed a little vacation  
But now I may never go home  
  
So I found me a little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She told me don't be so uptight  
She wanna keep up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I found me a pretty little thing  
Wanna keep me up all night  
She says she gonna make things all right  
She wanna keep me up all night  
Damn she might kill me  
  
I thought there ain't a thing I ain't seen

I'm in Brazil where the scene so fire  
Where the girls and trees can get hotter  
Everything that I see talks to me  
Can't believe how the girls be walking  
  
I've been here about an hour  
They keep saying come talk to me  
I keep thinking there's one and they say us three  
Standing there getting out of the shower  
Turning around showing me the thing got power

I Used to think that we've come too far to give up now  
Now I see that you're really not the one for me  
I constantly try to show my love, do everything  
But now I think if I voice my love how wrong could it be  
  
[Chorus]  
I never knew it before, I always thought I'd be sure  
I plan to be with only you forever  
But how can we just go on  
Now that I know it's so wrong  
We can't spend another day together  
  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye, cause I don't need you with me  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time, and it's all because of you  
  
I was blind, couldn't see the writing on the wall  
In my mind, you were the only one to be with me  
I can't believe, that it took so long to figure out  
The games you play, now the truth is clear I have no doubt  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye cause I don't need you in my life  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time, and I won't waste my time with you no more  
You should go, I don't want to feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye, you can leave, you can leave  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time, and I never knew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time  
Everything I tried to do, but it did not work  
You should go, I no longer feel like wasting time  
With you, goodbye  
It's time you know, that all the things we had that felt so good  
Were wasted time

Listen  
Baby, by the time you get this letter  
I'll be gone  
But I left something for you on the pillow  
Put this tape in  
Press play  
I love you  
  
It's four in the morning, I'm sitting here at night  
I'm writing you this song to say what's on my mind  
I'm leaving in an hour, and you won't be up in time to say goodbye, whoa  
I'm putting this on tape (baby, you're wonderful)  
I really mean it, babe (more than you will ever know)  
I wish that I could stay (but I gotta go)  
I'll be back, but in the meantime  
Keep in mind  
  
[Chorus]  
(What you are)  
Something too big for words  
And it's my pleasure to love you, baby, for better or worse  
('Cause what you are)  
A beautiful mother to your kids  
Sometimes, it slips my mind, so in case I forget  
(Girl, you are) you're better than (anything)  
I ever had  
(You are) the perfect love  
(Never give you up because you are)  
My heart, my soul, my breath  
Take it all until there's nothing left  
'Cause, baby, you are  
  
Now, no man has ever loved his woman  
More than I love you  
Girl, you know it's true  
And no man can ever say he does his woman better than I do you  
That ain't true (here's what I do)  
Send you fresh-cut roses every day of the week  
Take you shopping whenever  
More importantly  
Wrap my loving arms around you  
To reassure everything I felt that first night  
I feel it more  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
(You are)  
(You are)  
(You are)  
(Girl, you are)  
(You are)  
(You are)

It's been this many years  
It's been that many years  
And still have to ask the same question  
Why?  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Funny me, funny you  
Don't have nothing lft in common  
You wanted me to have your heart  
Now you want it back  
What about the promise you made to me  
That you wouldn't trade the key in for no damn reason  
And suddenly we're flying high  
Now it's Mayday we're falling fast  
You're trying to get lost  
I'm trying to pull up  
And damn I can't say  
You said you didn't need me  
I really didn't think that you would leave me  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Now the kids are looking at me like I'm to blame  
No longer got their respect for me  
Don't want to hear what I'm saying  
I know how it feels to be ashamed  
Cause when I was young I felt that pain too  
And I can't say nothing that would cause you to make a change  
And that's the reason that we're going our separate ways  
Then who am I fooling  
What am I doing thinking you love me  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
You would think by this time I would get it right  
Know the schemes and the things that make it be right  
When you said you could stay no longer  
I thought I had just a little more daylight  
LIke when we use to turn a fight into a good night  
I know the things I use to do to make you feel right  
I would give anything the fortune I made  
To bring back the days that the feeling was so right  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When you and me would kiss at night  
Remember what we tripped like  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why don't it feel like it felt on the first night  
When we were saying things like where have you been all my life  
Why don't it feel like felt on the first night  
Now it's so hard to find two words to say  
  
Why the dreams we had we threw them all away  
Why the dreams we had we let them slip away

Sleigh bells ring  
Are you listening?  
In the lane  
Snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight  
We're happy tonight  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away  
Is the bluebird  
Here to stay  
Is a new bird  
He sings a love song  
As we go along  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow  
We can build a snowman  
And pretend  
That he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun  
With Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids  
Come knock him down  
  
When it's cold  
Ain't it thrilling  
When your nose  
Gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The eskimo way  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland  
  
Walking  
In a winter wonderland

Baby you'll find  
There's only one love  
Yours and mine  
I've got so much love  
  
And needing you so  
My love for you  
I'll never let go  
I've got so much love  
  
All I want is to hold you  
Let me show how much I love you baby (show you)  
I don't mind and I don't mind (loving you)  
Girl I love you  
There's no one above you  
  
[Chorus]  
You are the sun  
You are the rain  
That makes my life this foolish game  
You need to know  
I love you so  
And I'd do it all again and again  
  
Tell me it's true  
I can't believe you do what you do  
I've got so much love  
And my love you'll see  
We'll stay together, just you and me  
I've got so much love  
  
Only you (know me)  
Tell me how to love you baby (show me)  
I don't mind and I don't mind (tell me)  
Girl, I love you  
Always thinking of you  
  
You are the sun  
You are the rain  
That makes my life this foolish game  
You need to know  
I love you so  
And I'd do it all again and again  
  
I know you know the way I feel  
And I need your love for always  
'Cause when I'm with you  
I fall in love  
Again and again and again, baby.  
  
You are the sun  
You are the rain  
That makes my life this foolish game  
You need to know  
I love you so  
And I'd do it all again and again  
  
You are the sun  
You are the rain, baby  
That makes my life this foolish game  
You need to know  
I love you so  
And I'd do it all again and again  
  
You are the sun  
You are the rain  
That makes my life this foolish game  
You need to know  
I love you so  
And I'd do it all again and again  
  
You are the sun  
You are the rain  
That makes my life this foolish game  
You need to know  
I love you so  
And I'd do it all again and again

You mean more to me,  
Than words can ever say  
Just to hold your hand  
And to know our love will stay  
Feels so right  
You're in my arms, my love  
Tonight  
  
Oh you,  
You mean more to me  
Than any love I've ever known  
And i want to give you all my love  
Just you alone  
  
Oh  
You're all my dreams come true  
There's so much joy in your eyes  
And all the love you give  
You've finally made me realize  
You're all i need  
  
Oh you  
You mean more to me  
Than words can ever say.

(Another mother's child)  
Another mother's child lay dying  
Caught up in the games that people play  
You think guns are the only answer  
But words can have a stronger say  
I feel like zoomin'  
I feel like zoomin', baby  
Zoomin' away from here now  
I, I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
If a brother is really your brother  
Does is matter, the colors that he wears?  
But every brother is your brother  
Can you hear me?  
But I don't think you really care  
I feel like zoomin'  
(Gotta change the way we think about it)  
Zoomin' away from here now  
I, I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
One mother's love shot down in a minute  
But you know, there's two mothers crying  
One son has paid the price, lost his life  
One's locked away but they're both goin' to stay  
Crazy love, how long  
(How long is this gonna go on?)  
Feel like zoomin'  
(Gotta find a better place right now)  
Feel like zoomin'  
(Gotta go on up, a little higher)  
There's so much trouble going on all around us  
We've got to find a better way of thinking  
Zoomin' is just a change in space to a place  
That's in your mind and it's not hard to find  
And it's not hard to find  
I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
Let me tell you  
Do you want a better place?  
Don't you want a better space?  
Let's go zoomin'  
You know, it's never hard to find  
It's just inside your mind  
Let's go zoomin', oh yeah  
I feel like zoomin'  
Feel like zoomin', baby  
Zoomin', yeah  
Zoomin' away from here now  
I, I feel like zoomin', oh yeah  
Zoomin' away from here  
Do you want a better place?  
Don't you want a better space?  
Let's go zoomin'  
You know, it's never hard to find  
It's just inside your mind  
Let's go zoomin', oh yeah
