Motorcycles in the parking lot  
Revving their engines and it just wont stop  
Matches the noise screaming in my head  
Houston I think we got a problem  
  
Where does everybody go when they go  
They go so fast I don't think they know  
We hate so fast  
And we love too slow  
London I think we got a problem  
  
And when I think about it  
I just can't think about it  
I try to drink about it  
I keep spinnin'  
  
Ave Mary A  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad  
Help me let go  
Of the chaos around me  
The devil that hounds me  
I need you to tell me  
  
Child be still  
Child be still  
  
Broken hearts all around the spot  
I can't help thinking that we lost the plot  
Suicide bomber and a student shot  
Tokyo I think we got a problem  
  
But for that they got a pill  
If that don't kill you then the side effects will  
If we don't kill each other then the side effects will  
Cape Town I think we got a problem  
  
Ave Mary A  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad  
Help me let go  
Of the chaos around me  
The devil that hounds me  
I need you to tell me  
  
Child be still  
  
If the darkest hour comes  
Before the light  
Where is the light  
Where is the light  
  
If the darkest hour comes before the light  
Where is the light  
Where is the light  
Where is the light, yeah  
  
Ave Mary A  
Where did you go  
Where did you go  
How did you know to get out of a world gone mad  
Help me help me let go  
Of the chaos around me  
The devil that hounds me  
I need you to tell me  
  
Child be still  
Child be still  
Child be still

Alright sir  
Sure I'll have another one it's early  
Three olives, shake it up, I like it dirty (dirty)  
Tequila for my friend it makes her flirty (flirty)  
Trust me  
  
I'm the investigator of underwear  
Showing up here and there uh oh (oh no)  
I'm always on a mission from the get-go (get-go)  
So what if it's only 1 o'clock in the afternoon  
It's never too soon to send out all the invatations to the last night (of your
life)  
  
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!  
I can't help it I like to party, it's genetic!  
It's electrifying, wind me up and watch me go  
Where she stops, nobody knows  
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you and you (x15)  
  
Alright ma'am (ma'am)  
Calm down I know your son said he was in my house (my house)  
He was the captain of the football team but I turned him out  
He wasn't the first and he won't be the last, to tone it down  
This happens all the time  
  
I'm a story to tell the alibi  
They wanna go home I asked them (why)  
It's daylight (not night)  
They might need a break from all the real life (get a life)  
It gets to be too much sometimes  
It's never too late to send out all the invitations to the last night of (your
life)  
  
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!  
I can't help I like to party it's genetic!  
It's electrifying, wind me up and watch me go  
Where she stops, nobody knows  
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you and you (x15)  
  
I'm off to see the doctor  
I hope she has a cure  
I hope she makes me better  
What does that even mean? (we don't know! )  
  
Lordy, Lordy, Lordy!  
I can't help it I like to party it's genetic!  
It's electrifying, wind me up and watch me go  
Where she stops, nobody knows  
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you

Where she stops, nobody knows  
A good excuse to be a bad influence on you and you (x15)  
I'm a good excuse (good excuse)  
To be a bad influence on you and you and you  
  
You're too tired  
You're not too tired!

There's a whole n'other conversation going on  
In a parralell universe  
Where nothig breaks and nothing hurts  
There's a waltz playing frozen in time  
Blades of grass on tiny bare feet  
I look at you and you're looking at me  
  
Could you beam me up,  
Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it  
Probably just stare, happy just to be there holding your face  
Beam me up,  
Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter,  
I think, a minutes enough,  
Just beam me up.  
  
Some black birds soaring in the sky,  
Barely a breath like our one last say  
Tell me that was you, saying goodbye,  
There are times I feel the shiver and cold,  
It only happens when I'm on my own,  
I tell ya, tell me, I'm not alone  
  
Could you beam me up,  
Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it  
I'd Probably just stare, happy just to be there, holding your face  
Beam me up,  
Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter,  
I think, a minutes enough,  
Just beam me up.  
  
In my head, I see your baby blues  
I hear your voice and I, I break in two and now there's  
One of me, with you  
  
So when I need you can I send you a sign  
I'll burn a candle and turn off the lights  
I'll pick a star and watch you shine  
  
Just beam me up,  
Give me a minute, I don't know what I'd say in it  
Probably just stare, happy just to be there, holding your face  
Beam me up,  
Let me be lighter, tired of being a fighter,  
I think, a minutes enough,  
Beam me up  
Beam me up  
Beam me up  
Could you beam me up

[Verse 1]  
White knuckles and sweaty palms from hanging on too tight,  
Clench of jaw, I've got another headache again tonight.  
Eyes on fire, eyes on fire, and the burn from all the tears,  
I've been crying, I've been crying, I've been dying over you.  
Tie a knot in the rope, trying to hold, trying to hold,  
But there's nothing to grab so I let go.  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much,  
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss).  
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit,  
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss).  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a shit day (no!)  
You had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss,  
I think I've had enough of this, blow me on last kiss.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I won't miss all of the fighting that we always did,  
Take it in, I mean what I say when I say there is nothing left.  
I am sick, whiskey-dick, no more battles for me,  
You'll be calling a trick, cause you'll no longer sleep.  
I'll dress nice, I'll look good, I'll go dancing alone,  
I'll laugh, I'll get drunk, I'll take somebody home!  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much,  
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss).  
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit,  
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss).  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a shit day (no!)  
You had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss,  
I think I've had enough of this, blow me one last kiss.  
  
[Bridge]  
(Blow me one last kiss)  
I will do what I please, anything that I want,  
I will breathe, I won't breathe, I won't worry at all.  
You will pay for your sins, you'll be sorry my dear,  
All the lies, all the wise, will be crystal clear.  
  
[Chorus]  
I think I've finally had enough, I think I maybe think too much,  
I think this might be it for us (blow me one last kiss).  
You think I'm just too serious, I think you're full of shit,  
My head is spinning so (blow me one last kiss).  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a shit day (no!)  
You had a shit day (no!), we've had a shit day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss,  
I think I've had enough of this, blow me on last kiss.  
  
Blow me one last kiss,  
Blow me one last kiss.  
  
Just when I think it can't get worse, I had a sh-t day (no!)  
You had a sh-t day (no!), we've had a sh-t day (no!)  
I think that life's too short for this, I'll pack my ignorance and bliss  
I think I've had enough of this. Blow me one last kiss...

It's tasty, it's like a cupcake  
It's cotton candy, it melts in your mouth  
And lately I been gettin' hunger pains  
When you lick your lips while you check me out  
  
Fast car, boring, girlfriend, boring  
Got money, boring, no, oh, oh, oh  
Hot friends, boring, rock band, boring  
Not interested, no, thank you  
  
If you want me you're gonna have to catch me  
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa  
And if you catch me you're gonna have to show me  
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa  
  
You're scrumptious, I kinda like it  
I'm indecisive, I change my mind a lot  
But you're hot  
(You're so hot)  
But I think you kinda know it  
Really hopin' you don't blow it, so bring it  
  
You're tired, boring, you're sore, boring  
You worked all day, boring, whoa-oa-oa-oa  
Big boat, boring  
Black amex, listening, six pack, well, heh  
  
If you want me you're gonna have to catch me  
If you wanna touch my whoa-oa-oa  
And if you catch me you're gonna have to show me  
How bad you really want my whoa-oa-oa  
  
Whoa-oa-oa-oa  
  
If I let you catch me  
It's because I think you're really cute  
And if you don't get it right

Fast car, boring, girlfriend, boring  
Got money, boring, whoa-oh-oh-oh  
Hot friends, boring, rock band, boring

[Verse 1]  
How many times have you sat across from me?  
And how many times have you told me you were leavin'?  
I'm no tryin' to listen, 'cause it's all the same  
And why, why are you constantly believing  
That I, I could ever give you what you're needing?  
Baby, baby, please don't put your faith in me  
I don't know what to say  
'Cause it's all a dream to me anyway  
  
[Chorus]  
You can catch me while  
I'm sleepin', darlin'  
While I'm dreamin', too  
It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place  
For me baby  
It must get lonely for you, too  
  
[Verse 2]  
People always fallin'  
In and out of love and  
It can be pretty painful, too  
And maybe, Oh maybe I'm just not strong enough  
Sad but true  
So tell me what's the use?  
  
Oh, Oh You can catch me while  
I'm sleepin', darlin'  
Maybe While I'm dreamin', too  
'Cause It's a lonely, lonely, lonely place  
For me baby  
It must get lonely for you, too  
  
[Chorus (Out)]

(can you turn it up please, just a tiny bit, that'd be awesome)  
  
I'm on the rebound  
I get it where I want to  
I'm on the way down  
I'm getting fixed without you  
You gave me a band-aid  
I put it on my heartbreak  
And all you got is pictures in your hand  
  
Don't you wish you could hold  
The angel in the centerfold  
The fantasy you couldn't control  
That walked away from you  
Don't you wish that you could hold  
The pretty little paper doll  
The one you couldn't quite control  
Who walked away from you  
  
Flip to me, I'm the centerfold  
I'm gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold  
We're gonna go, oh  
Hold tight  
  
I'm gonna hate you  
'til I forget you  
So here's a keepsake  
I left it in the bathroom  
Just a little something  
Something to remind you  
I'm sure you'll never get this close again  
  
Don't you wish you could hold  
The angel in the centerfold  
The fantasy you couldn't control  
Who walked away from you  
Don't you wish that you could hold  
The pretty little paper doll  
The one you couldn't quite control  
Who walked away from you  
  
Flip to me, I'm the centerfold  
I'm gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold  
We're gonna go, oh  
Hold tight  
  
Flip to me, I'm the centerfold  
I'm gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold  
We're gonna go, oh  
Hold tight  
  
Now it's him but it could've been you  
Tell me why it's him when it should've been you  
Its crazy how this makes you wanna change  
Here's an image you won't forget  
All your life I'll tease, I'll torment  
I'll be gone as soon as you turn the page  
  
Don't you wish you could hold  
The angel in the centerfold  
The fantasy you couldn't control  
Who walked away from you  
Don't you wish that you could hold  
The pretty little paper doll  
The one you couldn't quite control  
Who walked away from you  
  
Flip to me, I'm the centerfold  
I'm gonna charm you  
All night  
Stick to me, I'm the centerfold  
We're gonna go, oh, hold tight

I thought that you were driving, but you've given me the wheel  
There's rain clouds out there, that you don't wanna feel  
Your anger's like a razor blade, it's just too bloody real  
I thought that you would be here, no I just don't get it  
Hey, I also feel things more than I should  
I don't relax very often, as often as I could  
I worry how the whole thing looks, it doesn't look good  
But I thought that you would be here, no I just don't get it  
And being clear gets too much for me, just like it does for you  
Even though I want to, I want to, I don't  
  
I don't feel like calming down, no I don't  
I don't feel like hiding out, so I won't  
I can't turn the volume down, so I sit here in this  
Chaos and piss, watching the storm passing  
Storms are beautiful, right here it's beautiful  
  
I came all this way to be with you, and you're already gone  
If I was a good friend, I could right this wrong  
I'd kick away your crutches, make you walk on your own  
I really thought you'd be here, I just don't get it  
Though it looks warm in the rabbit hole, I could go down with you  
Even though I want to, I want to, I won't  
  
I don't feel like calming down, no I don't  
I don't feel like hiding out, so I won't  
I can't turn this volume down, so I sit here in this  
Chaos and piss, watching the storm passing  
It's beautiful  
  
I'm a willow tree, you can't blow me over  
And my roots go deep in anger  
I wanna feel the wind as it whips me like a prisoner  
I wanna be here  
I wanna be here  
  
No, I don't feel like calming down, no I don't  
I don't feel like hiding out, so I won't  
I can't turn the volume down, so I sit here in this  
Chaos and piss, watching the storm passing  
Storms are beautiful, this life is beautiful  
It is

Drinking wine and thinking bliss, is on the other side of this  
I just need a compass and a willing accomplice  
All my doubts that fill my head are skidding up and down again  
Up and down and round again, down and up and round again.  
  
Oh, I've had my chances and I've taken them all.  
Just to end up right back here on the floor.  
To end up right back here in on the floor.  
  
Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.  
Fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell.  
But I'm not scared at all... Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm  
  
The cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.  
  
Sometimes you think everything is wrapped inside a diamond ring  
Love just needs a witness and a little forgiveness  
And a halo of patience and a less sporadic pace and  
I'm learning to be brave in my beautiful mistakes.  
  
Oh I've felt that fire and I've been burned  
But I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned  
I wouldn't trade the pain for what I've learned.  
  
Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.  
Fortune teller that says maybe you will go to hell.  
But I'm not scared at all... Hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm  
  
Of the cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.  
  
Irony, irony, this hate and love, hate and love  
What it does to me, what it's done to me.  
What is done... Done  
  
Pennies in a well, a million dollars in the fountain of a hotel.  
Broken mirrors and a black cats cold stare,  
Walk under ladders on my way to hell, I'll meet you there.  
  
But I'm not scared at all, hmm... I'm not scared at all.  
  
Bout the cracks in the crystal, the cracks in the crystal ball.

Dear Mr. President  
Come take a walk with me  
Let's pretend we're just two people and  
You're not better than me  
I'd like to ask you some questions if we can speak honestly  
  
What do you feel when you see all the homeless on the street  
Who do you pray for at night before you go to sleep  
What do you feel when you look in the mirror  
Are you proud  
  
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry  
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Can you even look me in the eye  
And tell me why  
  
Dear Mr. President  
Were you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
Are you a lonely boy  
How can you say  
No child is left behind  
We're not dumb and we're not blind  
They're all sitting in your cells  
While you pave the road to hell  
  
What kind of father would take his own daughter's rights away  
And what kind of father might hate his own daughter if she were gay  
I can only imagine what the first lady has to say  
You've come a long way from whiskey and cocaine  
  
How do you sleep while the rest of us cry  
How do you dream when a mother has no chance to say goodbye  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Can you even look me in the eye  
  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Minimum wage with a baby on the way  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Rebuilding your house after the bombs took them away  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Building a bed out of a cardboard box  
Let me tell you bout hard work  
Hard work  
Hard work  
You don't know nothing bout hard work  
Hard work  
Hard work  
Oh  
  
How do you sleep at night  
How do you walk with your head held high  
Dear Mr. President  
You'd never take a walk with me  
Would you

Delirium  
  
So she thinks she's got a new boyfriend  
But the two of them have never met  
She's already got his name tattooed  
In a heart across her chest  
With his pictures plastered on her wall  
But he has never called  
And even all her friends they say:  
'You're living in delirium'  
  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you live in delirium  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da  
  
Secretly she's stalking him on the streets  
Making sure she's one step behind  
They even went to the movies together  
Or at least they stood in the same line  
She tells everyone he sends her flowers  
And love letters he sends her too  
And they talk on the phone for hours  
It's obvious she's come on blue  
  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you live in deliri  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
  
Every night you find her all alone  
Fantasising about the brand new home  
And she's waiting for the bells the ring a ding-a-ling  
Oh, God, she's lost her mind  
And her friends tell her all the time  
That it's make-believe  
This guy she sees it's her disease  
She's living in delirium  
  
She's so happy that she found someone  
But she's still living in delirium  
She's so happy that she found someone  
But she's still living in delirium  
  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium  
(She's so happy that she found someone  
But she's still living in delirium)  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium  
(She's so happy that she found someone  
But she's still living in delirium)  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium  
Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da, Da da da  
Babe, you're livin' in delirium

(You have two messages)  
(First message)  
  
Turn up the thermostat  
It's only 50 damn degrees  
Everybody is so warm and I'm so cold  
Say now can you believe that?  
She's got 17 tattoos  
And she sings about the blues and she's suburban  
  
Everybody is so obsessed with everybody else  
I didn't know that so and so broke up  
I was busy paying bills  
I don't always think I'm right, but I know I'm wronged  
  
I'm trying so hard to get through  
I'm trying so hard to hear you  
There's so much static in the line,  
That I can barely hear the truth  
Is it any wonder I'm the fool?  
Is it a surprise to be uncool?  
It's no wonder, I'm so disconnected  
  
(Second message)  
  
So tell me why you gotta laugh?  
I guess I must have missed the joke  
The over-caffeinated bullshit's got me tired  
I guess you know just where it's at  
You gotta have the latest things  
Keep your friends impressed another minute longer  
  
I can only imagine how uncomfortable it is inside that skin  
Having to stretch and mold to society  
And trouble fitting in  
Do you always think you're right but you know you're wrong?  
  
I'm trying so hard to get through  
I'm trying so hard to hear you  
There's so much static in the line,  
That I can barely hear the truth  
Is it any wonder I'm the fool?  
Is it a surprise to be uncool?  
It's no wonder, I'm so disconnected

Is it a surprise to be uncool?  
It's no wonder, I'm so disconnected  
(It's no wonder, It's no wonder)  
  
(It's no wonder, It's no wonder)

I like that though  
That's what's up  
  
Some people like the summer when it's hot  
  
Some people like the winter cold  
Some people speak their minds when they wanna  
And some other people ain't so bold  
Whatever it is that you do  
You should do you should do with your head held high  
So when you're doing you're thing it's cause you wanna  
And they never can ask you why  
  
1 I say  
Do what you do  
Say what you say  
Mean what you mean when you say  
Cause it's your life  
Gotta make your own rules  
And you gotta do it, do it your own way  
  
  
  
  
  
Repeat 1  
  
2 - Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh  
  
Some like it easy when others they like it rough  
But ain't nobody gotta like it but you  
Girl, boy, boy, girl, girl, girl, boy, boy  
Whatever, you should do what you do  
How can they tell you that you could or should?  
Would or wouldn't  
Well ask 'em can they walk in your shoes  
Cause it's your life and you do what you wanna  
And remember baby it's all about you  
  
Repeat 1 (2x)  
  
Repeat 2  
  
3 - So if it's on your mind  
Then you should speak your piece  
And say what'cha say  
And if you want it done  
Then you should get it done  
And do it your way  
  
Repeat 3  
  
Repeat 1 (2x)  
  
Repeat 2 (2x)  
  
Repeat 1 till end

I don't know if I can yell any louder  
How many times have I kicked you outta here?  
Or said something insulting?  
I can be so mean when I wanna be  
I am capable of really anything  
I can cut you into pieces when my heart is broken  
  
Please don't leave me, please don't leave me  
I always say how I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
Please don't leave me  
  
How did I become so obnoxious?  
What is it with you that makes me act like this?  
I've never been this nasty  
Can't you tell that this is all just a contest?  
The one that wins will be the one that hits the hardest  
But baby, I don't mean it, I mean it, I promise  
  
Please don't leave me, please don't leave me, don't leave me  
I always say how I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
Please don't leave me  
  
I forgot to say out loud  
How beautiful you really are to me  
I can't be without  
You're my perfect little punching bag  
And I need you, I'm sorry  
  
Please, please don't leave me, baby, please don't leave me  
No, don't leave me, please don't leave me  
I always say I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
  
Please don't leave me, please don't leave me  
I always say how I don't need you  
But it's always gonna come right back to this  
Please don't leave me, baby, please, please don't leave me

I am an opportunity and I knock so softly  
Sometimes I get loud when I wish everybody'd just  
Get off me  
So many playas you'd think I was a ball game  
Its every man for themself, there are no  
Team mates  
This life gets lonely when everybody wants  
Something  
This might have been your fate  
But they'll get their's eventually  
And I hope I'm there  
  
Surrounded by familiar faces without names  
None of them know me or want to share my pain  
And they only wish to bask in my light, then fade  
Away  
To win my love, to them a game  
To watch me live my life in pain  
When all is done and the glitter fades, fades  
Away  
They'll get their's eventually  
And I hope I'm there  
  
I drank your poison 'cause you told me it's wine  
Shame on you if you fool once  
Shame on me if you fool me twice  
I didn't know the price  
You'll get yours eventually  
  
So what good am I to you if I can't be broken?  
You'll get yours, yes you'll get yours  
Eventually

Oh Oh some deep shit  
Uh uh  
  
[Verse 1]  
Mama please stop cryin',  
I can't stand the sound.  
Your pain is painful and it's tearing me down.  
I hear glasses breakin',  
As I sit up in my bed,  
I told God you didn't mean those nasty things you said.  
You fight about money,  
'Bout me and my brother,  
And this I come home to,  
This is my shelter.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It ain't easy, growin' up in world war III,  
Never knowin' what love could be.  
You'll see, I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family  
  
[Chorus]  
Can we work it out?  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better,  
Mommy I'll do anything.  
Can we work it out?  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better,  
Daddy please don't leave.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Daddy please stop yelling (stop),  
I can't stand the sound (can't stand the sound).  
Make mama stop cryin',  
'Cause I need you around (yeah, yeah, yeah).  
My mama she loves you (I know it),  
No matter what she says is true.  
I know that she hurts you,  
But remember I love you too!  
I ran away today, ran from the noise,  
Ran away (ran away),  
Don't wanna go back to that place,  
But don't have no choice, no way.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
It ain't easy, growin' up in world war III,  
Never knowin' what love could be.  
You'll see, I don't want love to destroy me like it has done my family  
  
[Chorus]  
Can we work it out? (Can we work it)  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better (I promise),  
Mommy I'll do anything (anything to keep you back).  
Can we work it out?  
Can we be a family?  
I promise I'll be better (I promise, I promise),  
Daddy please don't leave.  
  
[Bridge]  
In our family portrait (in our family portrait),

Let's play pretend, let's act like it comes naturally.  
I don't wanna have to split the holidays (no, no),

I'll go to sleep at night  
  
Ooh no Ooh no

Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
Doo doo doo doo doo doo  
  
  
We go where we like, we got over time  
We get paid to rattle our chains  
We go in the back, paint our money black  
Spend it on the enemy  
  
  
Sleepin' in the church, ridin' in the dirt  
Put a banner over my grave  
Make a body work, make a beggar hurt  
Sell me somethin' big and untamed  
  
  
Now our time  
Real good time  
Now our time (Now our time)  
Real good time  
Now our time (Said now our time)  
Real good time (It's a really good time)  
(Baby, you're mine)  
  
  
We know how to pray, party every day  
Make a desolation of play  
Ridin' in a rut till the powers cut  
We don't even have a good name  
  
  
Sleepin' in the church, ridin' in the dirt  
Put a banner over my grave  
Make a body work, make a beggar hurt  
Sell me somethin' big and untamed  
  
  
Now our time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)  
Real good time (Doo doo doo doo doo doo)

Feel good, real good  
It's the same old sayin'  
Feel good, real good  
Don't have no brains (I don't got no brains)  
Baby, you're mine

I'm alone now  
Staring at the cieling  
(uh, uh)  
I'm kina bored now  
I can't sleep  
(I can't sleep, uh, uh)  
  
And you only can make my life complete  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
And when you come you slip into a dream  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
I press record, I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
I let my fingers do the walking  
  
(sth, mmm)  
  
I'm starving (sth)  
For some attention  
I'm begging, pleading, bleeding  
For a suggestion  
(uh, uh, uh)  
  
I bite my tongue because I wanna scream  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
I'm almost there then you turn and look at me  
(uh, uh. Ah, ie)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
I press record I become a fiend  
  
While no one else is watching  
(I let my fingers do the walking)  
  
Rewind and you will see  
(You will see)  
While in the morning i'm happy  
(I'm happy)  
Right there on the tv screen  
(On the tv)  
(Me vengo, me vengo)  
  
I'm restless  
You need some caffeine

I'm wasted  
If you could only see  
(Only see)  
  
Cuz I need more than you are gonna give  
(uh, uh. Ah, i)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast a sleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
(ahhhhhh)!  
I press record, I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
(no, no, no no)  
  
When it's late at night and you're fast asleep  
I let my fingers do the walking  
(My fingers do the walking)  
I press record I become a fiend  
While no one else is watching  
(No one else is watching)

See my days are cold without you  
But I'm hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart can't take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
See my days are cold without you  
But I'm hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart can't take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
  
Baby I don't know why ya treatin me so bad  
You said you love me, no one above me  
And I was all you had  
And though my heart is eating for ya  
I can't stop crying  
I don't know how  
I allow you to treat me this way and still i stay  
  
Baby I don't know why ya wanna do me wrong  
See when I'm home, I'm all alone  
And you are always gone  
Boy, you know I really love you  
I can't deny  
I can't see how you could bring me to so many tears  
after all these years  
  
See my days are cold without you  
But I'm hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart can't take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
See my days are cold without you  
But I'm hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart can't take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
Oohhhhh  
I trusted you, I trusted you  
So sad, so sad  
what love will make you do  
all the things that we accept  
be the things that we regret  
too all of my ladies (ladies) feel me  
c'mon sing wit me  
See, when I get the strength to leave  
Always tell me that you need me  
And I'm weak cause I believe you  
And I'm mad because I love you  
So I stop and think that maybe  
You can learn to appreciate me  
Then it all remains the same that  
You ain't never gonna change  
(never gonna change, never gonna change)  
See my days are cold without you  
But I'm hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart can't take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
See my days are cold without you  
Butm hurtin while im with you  
And though my heart can't take no more  
I keep on running back to you  
  
Baby why you hurt me leave me and desert me  
Boy I gave you all my heart  
And all you do is tear it up  
Looking out my window  
Knowing that I should go  
Even when I pack my bags  
This something always hold me back

Everything's broken  
But nothing really needs to be fixed  
Everything I always say  
I always contradict  
Don't keep pushing me  
Don't keep aching me  
I know you love me, baby  
But I don't want to know how  
  
'Cause I want to be free  
But there's still things I need  
And I want to be free, oh, baby  
Why's it so hard to understand me  
I speak clearly  
Just give me what I need  
Oh, oh, no, no  
Just give me what I need  
  
Oh, yeah, oh  
I'm tired of strangers always comin' 'round  
I'm tired of all these favours  
Cause I don't know what they're about  
I've gotta get away, oh  
From these conditions  
Why can't I just love myself enough?  
Instead of looking outside  
For what I should have inside  
I wanna live in a world with  
No mirrors, no sizes, no consequence and no prizes  
No past, no future, no ages, no losers  
No hate, no desire, no fate  
All these shackles that I tied myself down with  
They're weighing me down  
I wanna fly away, fly away from here, so far  
Just give me wings  
Oh, God, why's it so hard, to be free?  
  
And I just wanna  
Just wanna be free  
And I wish I wish I didn't depend on your love  
I wish I loved myself enough  
  
Somebody once told me  
"You can't take nothing, nothing but your deeds"  
I'm not proud of most of mine  
That I still have a long way to find  
And I'm going down that road so fast  
I wanna be free, yeah, just  
Just give me a ticket, baby  
Oh, it's what I need  
Take it all away from me  
I wanna be, I wanna be free  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
And what if I gave up all those things that I need  
That I think make me who I am  
Why, yeah, oh  
  
I'm so much love to give  
We're all killing ourselves for  
And you were late, you were late  
Would someone help me please?  
Will someone help me, help me?  
And I wanna be free, free, yeah  
Oh, yeah, just give me what I need  
I wanna be free

I dance around this empty house  
Tear us down, throw you out  
Screaming down the halls  
Spinning all around and now we fall  
  
Pictures framing up the past  
Your taunting smirk behind the glass  
This museum full of ash  
Once a tickle, now a rash  
  
This used to be a Funhouse  
But now it's full of evil clowns  
It's time to start the countdown  
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down  
I'm gonna burn it down  
  
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fun  
  
Echoes knocking on locked doors  
All the laughter from before  
I'd rather live out on the street  
Than in this haunted memory  
  
I've called the movers, called the maids  
We'll try to exorcise this place  
Drag my mattress to the yard  
Crumble, tumble house of cards  
  
This used to be a Funhouse  
But now it's full of evil clowns  
It's time to start the countdown  
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down  
  
This used to be a Funhouse  
But now it's full of evil clowns  
It's time to start the countdown  
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down  
I'm gonna burn it down  
  
9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1, fun  
  
I'm crawling through the doggy door  
My key don't fit my life no more  
I'll change the drapes, I'll break the plates  
I'll find a new place, burn this fucker down  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
Do, do, do, do, da, da, da, da  
  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
(9, 8)  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
(7, 6)  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
(5, 4, 3)  
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do  
(2, 1)  
  
This used to be a Funhouse  
But now it's full of evil clowns  
It's time to start the countdown  
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down  
  
This used to be a Funhouse  
But now it's full of evil clowns  
It's time to start the countdown  
I'm gonna burn it down, down, down  
I'm gonna burn it down

Have you ever fed a lover with just your hands?  
Close your eyes and trust it, just trust it  
Have you ever thrown a fist full of glitter in the air?  
Have you ever looked fear in the face  
And said I just don't care  
  
It's only half past the point of no return  
The tip of the ice burg  
The sun before the burn  
The thunder before lightning  
The breathe before the phrase  
Have you ever felt this way?  
  
Have you ever hated yourself for staring at the phone?  
You're whole life waiting on the ring to prove you're not alone  
Have you ever been touch so gently you had to cry?  
Have you ever invited a stranger to come inside?  
  
It's only half past the point of oblivion  
The hourglass on the table  
The walk before the run  
The breathe before the kiss  
And the fear before the flames  
Have you ever felt this way?  
  
La La La La La La La La  
  
There you are, sitting in the garden  
Clutching my coffee,  
Calling me sugar  
You called me sugar  
  
Have you ever wished for an endless night?  
Lasso the moon and the stars and pulled that rope tight  
Have you ever held your breathe and asked yourself will it ever get better
than tonight?  
Tonight

[VERSE 1:]  
I've been the girl with her skirt pulled high  
Been the outcast never running with mascara eyes  
Now I see the world as a candy store  
With a cigarette smile, saying things you can't ignore  
Like Mommy I love you  
Daddy I hate you  
Brother I need you  
Lover, hey "fuck you"  
I can see everything here with my third eye  
Like the blue in the sky  
  
[CHORUS:]  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
Love is the rhythm  
You are the music  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
You get what you're given  
It's all how you use it  
  
[Verse 2:]  
I've been the girl- middle finger in the air  
Unaffected by rumors, the truth: I don't care  
So open your mouth and stick out your tongue  
You might as well let go, you can't take back what you've done  
So find a new lifestyle  
A new reason to smile  
Look for Nirvana  
Under the strobe lights  
Sequins and sex dreams  
You whisper to me  
There's no reason to cry  
  
[CHORUS:]  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
Love is the rhythm  
You are the music  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
You get what you're given  
It's all how you use it  
  
[BRIDGE:]  
You take what you get and you get what you give  
I say don't run from yourself, man, that's no way to live  
I've got a record in my bag you should give it a spin  
Lift your hands in the air so that life can begin  
  
If God Is a DJ... If God  
If God is a DJ (life is a dance floor)  
Get your ass on the dance floor  
  
[CHORUS (2X):]  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
Love is the rhythm  
You are the music  
If God is a DJ  
Life is a dance floor  
You get what you're given  
It's all how you use it

I'm goin' to California  
To live in the summer sun  
The streets are made of silver  
I'm like a rabbit on the run  
Philidelphia freedom  
Well it's not like you have heard, no, no, no  
This city of brotherly love  
Is full of pain and hurt  
  
I'm goin' to California  
To find my pot of gold  
Corruption on every corner  
Hustlers sellin' sweets  
Baby is home cryin'  
While her mom is on the streets  
Everybody's dyin'  
Have you heard the news today?  
A woman in north Phili is mournin'  
A bullet took another son away  
  
I'm goin to California  
I'm goin far, far, far away  
  
Goin' to California, yes  
To resurect my soul  
The sun is always shinin', shinin'  
Or atleast that's what I'm told  
I'm goin' to California  
There's a better life for me, yes  
Goin' to California  
I'll write and tell you what I see  
I'm goin' to California  
Somebody say a prayer for me

1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years go by,  
I don't really know why I don't really know why,  
7, 8, 9, 11 years go by,  
I don't really know why I don't really know why,  
I still feel the same way I did when I was 17,  
I still look over my shoulder waitin for the world to change  
  
But these are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
And I think I'd like to stay,  
Oh, I'd like to stay,  
Oh, I'd like to stay  
  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years ago,  
I didn't see a belly with a child on the inside,  
6, 7, 8, 10 years ago I thought I knew about love,  
I only knew about the fight,  
I look back and I realize all those times I was lonely,  
Praying for something to hurry up and come and save me,  
  
But these are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
And I wish that I could stay,  
Oh, I wish that I could stay,  
I wish I could stay  
  
(These are the good old days)  
I could stay,  
These are the good old days,  
And the more that you let it go,  
The faster the time goes,  
The darker the night is,  
The lighter the moon glows  
  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days  
  
1, 2, 3, 4, 5 years from now,  
I hope I'm still getting down,  
I hope I'm still around,  
But 6, 7, 8, 10 beers ago,  
I had a revelation all is well right now,  
It's all good right now,  
It's all good right now,  
It's all good right now  
  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
And I wish that I could stay  
  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
And I wish that I could stay  
  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
And I wish that I could stay,  
I wish that I could stay,  
And I wish that I could stay  
  
These are the good old days,  
And I wish that I could stay,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days,  
These are the good old days

Never win first place  
I don't support the team  
I can't take direction and my socks are never clean  
Teachers dated me  
My parents hated me  
I was always in a fight  
Cuz I can't do nothin right  
Every day I fight a war against a mirror  
I can't take the person staring back at me  
I'm a hazard to myself  
Don't let me get me

Tired of being compared  
To damn Britney Spears

So doctor doctor won't you please prescribe me somethin  
A day in the life of someone else  
Cuz I'm a hazard to myself  
Don't let me  
I'm my own worst enemy  
It's bad when you don't know yourself  
So irratiting  
Don't want to be my friend no more  
I wanna be somebody else  
Yeah

I keep thinkin' bout that little sparkle in your eye  
Is it a light from the angels, or your devil deep inside?  
What about the way you say you love me all the time  
Are you liftin' me up to heaven just to drop me down the line?  
There's a ring around my finger, but will you change your mind?  
And you tell me that I'm beautiful but that could be lie  
Are you a heartbreaker  
Maybe you want me for the ride  
What if I'm fallin' for a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leavin' here alive  
I wont be leavin' here alive, no  
Temporary happiness is like waiting for the knife  
Cause I'm always watchin' for someone to show their darker side  
So maybe I'll sit back and just enjoy all this for now  
Watch it all play out see if you really stick around  
But there's always this one question that keeps me up at night  
Are you my greatest love or disappointment in my life  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride what if I'm fallin' for
a heartbreaker and everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I'm holding on with both hands and both feet ooohhhh  
Promise that you won't pull the rug out from under me  
Are you a heartbreaker maybe you want me for the ride  
I pray to god you're not a heartbreaker  
This time around I wont survive cause if I've fallin' for a heartbreaker  
And everything is just a lie  
I wont be leaving here alive  
I might as well lay down and die  
I wont be leaving here alive

What is this? I heard you've got a new miss  
Just broke up so you know that I'm pissed  
They say your faithful I don't believe that shit oh no, oh no  
  
Bridge:  
Oh I've tried to act like I don't care  
But it doesn't seem fair you're so good to her  
And I've tried to pretend I don't see  
All those things that you do you couldn't do for me  
  
Chorus:  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin' her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
  
So I hear I've met the wench before (Yeah, I remember that time we went to
Pizza Hut and you told me she was your cousin)  
I hear you learned to open doors (When did you become such a damn gentleman?)  
  
Bridge:  
Oh I've tried to act like I don't care  
But it doesn't seem fair you're so good to her  
And I've tried to pretend I don't see  
All those things that you do you couldn't do for me  
  
Chorus:  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life  
Givin' her love all day all night  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
  
What does she do to you to make you give her everything  
Like you never did for me  
Call it jealousy, but it's killing me  
Cause all the time that you were mine  
You didn't treat me right  
No, no, no you didn't treat me right, no, no, no Whoa  
  
Chorus:  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
I was in love wit ya  
But hell wit ya cause you didn't wanna treat me right  
Now you got another girl in your life

In your face  
Hit you  
Till you see stars  
  
I'm a passionate one  
And you're my masterpiece  
But baby  
You must be warned

And I will break you  
To pieces  
Trust me

I can't help it  
(I can't help it)  
I'll put you  
On your knees  
And I'll walk over you  
Just to show you  
How I feel  
I'm in love with you  
I love you so much  
I wanna slash your tyres  
To stop you  
From driving drunk  
Come over here  
I want you  
To taste my poison  
To stop you  
From eating drunk  
  
I know you're the one  
'Cause you're not afraid  
You're not afraid of me  
Let's give it some time  
See if you get scared  
'Cause maybe you should be  
A little pain and pleasure  
Never hurt no-one  
I promise  
To try to be better  
'Cause you're the only one  
  
I can't help it  
(No, no, no)  
I'll put you  
On your knees  
I can't help it  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
And I'll walk over you  
Just to show you  
How I feel  
I'm in love with you  
  
I can't help it  
(Can't help it)  
I'll take you  
Like a whore  
And when I am done  
With you  
I'll feel no remorse  
I'm in love with you  
A little pain  
A pleasure  
Never hurt no-one  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
I can't help it  
No, no, no  
I can't help it  
(No, no, no)  
I'll put you  
On your knees

On your knees)  
I can't help it  
(Yeah, yeah, yeah)  
And I'll walk over you  
Just to show you  
How I feel  
I'm in love with you

I don't mind it  
I don't mind at all  
It's like you're the swing set  
And I'm the kid that falls  
It's like the way we fight  
The times I've cried  
We come to blows  
And every night  
The passion's there  
So it's got to be right  
Right?  
  
No I don't believe you  
When you say don't come around here no more  
I won't remind you  
You said we wouldn't be apart  
No I don't believe you  
When you say you don't need me anymore  
So don't pretend to  
Not love me at all  
  
I don't mind it  
I still don't mind at all  
It's like one of those bad dreams  
When you can't wake up  
It looks like you've given up  
You've had enough  
But I want more  
No I won't stop  
Because I just know  
You'll come around  
Right?  
  
No I don't believe you  
When you say don't come around here no more  
I won't remind you  
You said we wouldn't be apart  
No I don't believe you  
When you say you don't need me anymore  
So don't pretend to  
Not love me at all  
  
Just don't stand there and watch me fall  
Because I, because I still don't mind at all  
  
It's like the way we fight  
The times I've cried  
We come to blows  
And every night  
The passion's there  
So it's got to be right,  
Right?  
  
No I don't believe you  
When you say don't come around here no more  
I won't remind you  
You said we wouldn't be apart  
No I don't believe you  
When you say you don't need me anymore  
So don't pretend to  
Not love me at all  
  
I don't believe you

I conjure up the thought of being gone  
But I'd probably even do that wrong  
I try to think about which way  
Would I be able to and would I be afraid  
  
Cause oh I'm bleeding out inside  
Oh I don't even mind (Yeah)  
  
It's all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I can't turn back  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air  
And it's not fair  
  
Da da dada da dada da  
Da dadadadadada da dadadadadada  
  
I'm trying to figure out what else to say (What else could I say)  
To make you turn around and come back this way (Would you just come back this
way)  
I feel like we could be really awesome together  
So make up your mind cause it's now or never (oh)  
  
It's all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I can't turn back  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air  
And it's not fair  
  
I would never pull the trigger  
But I've cried wolf a thousand times  
I wish you could  
Feel as bad as I do  
I have lost my mind  
  
It's all your fault  
You called me beautiful  
You turned me out  
And now I can't turn back  
I hold (I hold) my breath (My breath)  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air (running out of air)  
And it's not fair  
  
(Oh yeah  
It's all your fault)  
  
I hold my breath  
Because you were perfect  
But I'm running out of air  
And it's not (It's not) fair

Honey what have you done?  
Dum dum dum, it's the sound, it's the sound  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her whole world's come undone  
From lookin' straight at the sun  
What did her daddy do?  
What did he put you through?  
They say when Janie was arrested  
They found him underneath a train  
But man, he had it comin'  
Now that Janie's got a gun  
She ain't never gonna be the same  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
Tell me now it's untrue  
What did her daddy do?  
He jacked a little bitty baby  
The man has got to be insane  
They say the spell that he was under  
The lightning and the thunder  
Knew that someone had to stop the rain  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away  
  
Janie's got a gun  
Janie's got a gun  
Her dog day's just begun  
Now everybody is on the run  
  
What did her daddy do?  
It was Janie's last I. O. You  
She had to take him down easy  
And put a bullet in his brain  
She said 'cause nobody believs me  
The man was such a sleaze, he ain't  
Never gonna be the same  
  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away, run away from the pain  
Yeah, yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Run away, run away, run, run away

[Verse 1]  
Right from the start you were a thief, you stole my heart,  
And I your willing victim.  
I let you see the parts of me that weren't all that pretty,  
And with every touch you fixed them.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh,  
Things you never say to me, oh, oh,  
Tell me that you've had enough  
Of our love, our love.  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts,  
We're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
  
[Verse 2: Nate Ruess]  
I'm sorry I don't understand where all of this is coming from.  
I thought that we were fine (oh, we had everything)  
Your head is running wild again, my dear we still have everythin',  
And it's all in your mind (yeah, but this is happenin')  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh,  
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh,  
There's nothing more than empty sheets,  
Between our love, our love.  
Oh, our love, our love!  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
I never stopped, you're still written in the scars on my heart,  
You're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again!  
  
[Hook]  
Oh, tear ducts and rust,  
I'll fix it for us.  
We're collecting dust,  
But our love's enough.  
You're holding it in,  
You're pouring a drink!  
No nothing is as bad as it seems.  
We'll come clean!  
  
[Bridge]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts,  
We're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Just give me a reason, just a little bit's enough,  
Just a second, we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
It's in the stars, it's been written in the scars on our hearts,  
That we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.  
  
[Outro]  
Oh, we can learn to love again,  
Oh, we can learn to love again.  
Oh, oh, that we're not broken just bent,  
And we can learn to love again.

[Verse 1]  
I know that I'm running out of time,  
I want it all mmm mmm  
And I'm wishing they'd stop tryna turn me off,  
I want it all mmm mmm  
And I'm walking on a wire, trying to go higher,  
Feels like I'm surrounded by clowns and liars.  
Even when I give it all away,  
I want it all  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
Oh...  
  
[Chorus]  
Just like fire, burning up' the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day.  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free,  
I'ma disappear when they come for me.  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like fire.  
  
[Verse 2]  
And people like to laugh at you cause they  
Are all the same.  
See I would rather we just go our different way,  
Than play the game.  
And no matter the weather, we can do it better,  
You and me together forever and ever.  
We don't have to worry about a thing,  
About a thing  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
We came here to run it, run it, run it, run it...  
Oh...  
  
  
[Chorus]  
Just like fire, burning out the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day.  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free,  
I'mma disappear when they come for me.  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like fire, fire, fire.  
Running, running, running,  
We can here them runing, runing, runing.  
  
[Hook]  
So I came here to run it,  
Just cause nobody's done it,  
Y'all don't think I can run it,  
But look, I've been here, I've done it.  
Impossible? Please,  
Watch, I do it with ease,  
You just gotta believe,  
Come on, come on with me.  
  
Oh, what you gonna do? (What, what?!)  
Hay, what you gonna do? (What, what?!)  
Oh, what you gonna do? (What, what?!)  
Mmm, what you gonna do?  
  
[Bridge]  
Just like fire, burning out the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day.  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
  
[Outro]  
Just like fire, burning out the way,  
If I can light the world up for just one day (one day! ).  
Watch this madness, colorful charade,  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like magic, I'll be flying free,  
I'mma disappear when they come for me.  
I kick that ceiling, what you gonna say?  
No one can be just like me any way!  
Just like fire, fire!  
Running, running, running,  
Just like fire!  
(Running, running, running...)

Ah Yeah yeah... Ahh  
  
I need some time  
To make up my mind (mind)  
You've got the key to my heart (key to my heart)  
Baby don't you ever go away (go away)  
  
Sitting here thinking about the time we first met  
It brings a smile to my face  
No one else could ever take your place  
Yet I'm afraid of falling in love  
The joy the pain that love can bring  
Promise me you'll never leave my side  
  
Your kind of love (kind of love)  
Is very special (very special)  
Our love sent from heaven above (heaven above)  
  
Chorus:  
I need some time (I need some time)  
To make up my mind  
You've got the key to my heart (key to my heart)  
Baby don't you ever go away too far  
I need you safe in my arms (safe in my arms)  
You've got the key to my heart  
Baby please don't you ever leave my side  
  
So we've touched  
I don't wanna rush this feeling  
Relax your mind it's all that goes  
I know you ever felt this way before  
Love is to control  
And I'm the one you want to hold  
I know that you want me  
And boy you know I really want you too  
  
Your kind of love (kind of love)  
Is very special (very special)  
Our love sent from heaven above (heaven above  
  
Chorus  
  
I need some time (I want you to stay, I want you to say)  
To make up my mind (I want to hold you)  
You've got the key to my heart (key to my heart)  
Baby don't you walk away too times (promise me we'll never part)  
I need you safe in my arms (safe in my arms)  
You've got the key to my heart  
Baby please don't you ever leave my side

[Chorus:]  
Why was I the last to know  
That you weren't coming to my show you coulda  
Called me up to say "good luck"  
You coulda called me back you stupid fuck  
Why was I the last to know?  
  
[Verse:]  
First date, we ate sushi and  
It went well, I was funny and  
You said I was a cutie  
That's the last thing I heard from you  
I left the tickets at the door for you  
I had to tell my mom that there was  
No more room  
You didn't show, that was so uncool  
You coulda called me back  
  
So I guess this means that we're  
Not friends anymore, I heard  
It's me you're asking for, I thought  
I'd see you at the show  
You said you'd go  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
[Verse 2:]  
After the date, I wouldn't go  
Home with you  
I wouldn't put my heels in the  
Air for you  
You tried to get me to do things  
I just won't do  
Last I heard from you  
Here is how I guess the story goes  
You woulda came if I was a ho  
Fuck for parts that's just not how  
I roll, move it on down the road  
  
So I guess, we, shouldn't be  
Friends anymore, sick of hearin'  
That it's me you're askin' for  
'Cause I thought I'd see you at the  
Show, you said you'd go!  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You thought you know me  
I guess you didn't  
You thought you had me  
I think you didn't  
You thought you knew me  
But you didn't  
  
[Chorus (Out)]

I never thought that it would be,  
Not in my wildest dream,  
I've realized that your not the one for me,  
So why can't you see, that,  
I gave my all to you,  
But you proved my love untrue,  
So tell me boy what am I supposed to do,  
About you, about you you you oh o  
  
Chorus:  
I gave you what you wanted,  
I gave you what you need, I walked the fire for ya,  
But now I'm gonna leave,  
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time),  
And now my eyes are open,  
Won't be a fool no more,  
I built my world around ya,  
And now I'm out the door,  
I'm leaving for the last time.  
  
Verse 2:  
Days! And night would pass me by,  
And all I did was cry,  
Cause all the promises you told me where lies,  
So why did you deceive me?  
Now there's nothing left to do,  
But get away from you,  
I wish the way that I felt was so untrue,  
About you,  
About you you you oh o  
  
Chorus:  
I gave you what you wanted,  
I gave you what you need,  
I walked the fire for you,  
But now I'm gonna leave,  
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time)  
And now my eyes are open,  
Won't be a fool no more,  
I built my world around ya,  
And now I'm out the door (I'm leaving for the last time)  
  
Bridge:  
I never thought that you would treat me this way,  
Turn around and think that it is ok,  
Boy you know that you hurt me,  
And I just cannot stay,  
You did me wrong,  
For so long,  
I'm moving on,  
I'm moving on,  
I'm leaving for the last time,  
Leaving for the last time, No babe  
  
Chorus:  
I gave you what you wanted,  
I gave you what you need (Yes I did)  
I walked the fire for ya (I, I, I'm)  
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time babe)  
And now my eyes are open,  
Won't be a fool no more,  
I built my world around ya,  
And now I'm out the door,  
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time baby)  
  
Chorus:  
I gave you what you wanted,  
I gave you what you need (Yes I did)  
I walked the fire for ya (I, I, I'm)  
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time babe)  
And now my eyes are open,  
Won't be a fool no more,  
I built my world around ya,  
And now I'm out the door,  
I'm leaving for the last time (I said I'm leaving for the last time baby)

I always seem to look so sad  
But that's not me, I'm just bad  
Why do you keep on following me  
Is this what I'm going to be?  
Just tell me what you got  
I don't know if I like you or not  
If you wanna know that'll always keep on trying  
Not to let you crying,  
Baby, can't you see what I want to be?  
  
Chorus:  
Just let me know  
When do you let me go  
I want to be free  
Can't you see  
Just let me go  
I've got things to show  
But not this time  
Let me go  
  
I don't want you here to stay  
I just want you here away  
It's not my fault  
It's something I can't solve  
Let me be free  
There's something I wanna be  
I can't beseen with you  
It's the things you do  
Let me go, let me flow  
Through your mind  
Through your soul  
I got to have you low  
  
Chorus  
  
When I always keep on trying...  
You are my friend that's crying  
Don't you wanna know  
What's got in to me  
I really want to be free  
Can't, ohh, can't you see...  
Boy, you'll have to let me go...  
  
Chorus x3

Ooh ooh  
  
Dear baby  
I'm not sorry  
For leaving you this way  
And I know I should have told you  
Face to face  
We've always been straight up  
So I won't waste your time

I know what you did last night  
  
1 Let me let you know yeah  
That I'm leaving baby

But I'm going far from here  
Let me let you know, yeah  
That I'm leaving baby, yeah, oh yeah  
  
One more thing before I go  
I hope you feel alone  
Cause I'm definitely tired of waiting  
For you to come home  
(Been waiting for you at home)  
We've always been straight up  
So I'll just take what's mine  
I'm leaving so say goodbye  
Cause you've heard me for the last time  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Whatever your excuse is  
I'm sure I've heard them all before  
Time and time again I told you  
That I need you more  
Now I'm walking out the door, oh  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Ooh baby, I'm just here to let you know honey

I don't know where I'm going  
But I'm going far from here  
Let me let you know, yeah  
That I'm leaving baby, yeah, oh yeah

I kinda noticed in one night  
  
It's kinda wierd to me  
Since your so fine  
If it's up to me your face will change  
If you smile then that  
Should set the tone  
Just remember  
And if you let go the music  
Should move your bones  
Just remember  
(Sing this song with me)  
  
Can't nobody love ya like I love ya  
You're a good girl and that's  
What makes me trust ya  
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference  
When I touch ya  
  
Some people are so phony  
Nosey 'cause they lonely  
Aren't you sick of the same thing?  
They say so and so is dating  
Love you or they hatin'  
And it doesn't even matter anyway  
Cause were here tonight  
If you smile then that  
Should set the tone  
Just remember baby  
And if you let go the music should  
Move your bones  
Just remember  
(Sing this song with me)  
  
Can't nobody love ya like I love ya  
You're a good girl and that's  
What makes me trust ya  
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference  
When I touch ya  
  
If you give that chance  
To be your man(x2)  
  
Maybe we'll fly the night away  
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl) (x2)  
  
Maybe we'll fly the night away  
(I just wanna love ya baby, girl)  
  
Can't nobody love ya like I love ya  
You're a good girl and that's  
What makes me trust ya  
Late at night I talk to you  
You will know the difference  
When I touch ya

Living in my world  
  
So many riffs you have with your girl  
But I'm here to hear all your problems and tell you I understand,  
Falling in and out of love with her now. As I watch all I can see... Is you
being with me,  
I know you feel like a fool, being used, paying dues,  
Afraid of your loving is taken advantage of,  
You don't have to live a life full of strife, take my hand and i'll be the
leader  
You can depend on me  
  
Chorus  
You can be living in my world, sharing my time, being the one,  
Stare in the face of love, long enough to see,  
You can be living in my world, you'll never shed another tear,  
And i'll never stop the love, I'll give you all of me  
  
With open eyes and ears I can hear, hear your crys come from the inside,  
But baby its alright, you can just let it go, I'm your friend  
Sitting here, willing to listen... Oh baby see that you don't have to live,  
Like you do, come with me be my king i'll be by your side,  
Just let me know what to do, only one goal in mind,  
Take your heart, share with mine, make you believe, so you can see that  
  
Chorus  
  
It only takes one look to see,  
That she's a fool and you should know,  
Come with me, and I will be... All that you need,  
Theres no dreams we can't make real,  
And theres no feelings we can't feel,  
I'm just... Wanting you... Needing you.. Don't you know  
  
Chorus

I can remember the very first time I cried  
How I wiped my eyes and buried the pain inside  
All of my memories - good and bad - that's past  
Didn't even take the time to realize  
  
Starin' at the cracks in the walls  
'cause I'm waiting for it all to come to an end  
Still I curl up right under the bed  
'cause it's takin' over my head all over again  
  
Do you even know who you are?  
I guess I'm tryin' to find  
A borrowed dream or a superstar?  
I want to be a star  
Is life good to you or is it bad?  
I can't tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have?  
  
Lyin' awake watchin' the sunlight  
How the birds will sing as I count the rings  
Around my eyes  
Constantly pushing the world I know aside  
I don't even feel the pain, I don't even want to  
Try  
  
I'm lookin' for a way to become  
The person that I dreamt of when I was sixteen  
Oh, nothin' is ever enough  
Ooh, baby, it ain't enough for what it may seem  
  
Do you even know who you are?  
I'm still tryin' to find  
A borrowed dream or a superstar?  
Everybody wants to be  
Is life good to you or is it bad?  
I can't tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have?  
No  
  
Sorry girl, tell a tale for me  
'cause I'm wondering how you really feel  
I'm a lonely girl, I'll tell a tale for you  
'cause I'm just tryin' to make all my dreams come  
True  
  
Do you even know who you are?  
Oh, yeah, yeah  
A borrowed dream or a superstar?  
Oh, I wanted to be a star  
Is life good to you or is it bad?  
I can't tell, I can't tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have?  
I guess not, oh I guess not  
  
Do you even know who you are?  
Oh, I'm tryin' to find  
A rising dream or a superstar?  
Oh, I have a all these dreams  
Is life good to you or is it bad?  
I can't tell anymore  
Do you even know what you have?  
No, no  
Do you even know what you are?  
A rising dream or a fallen star?  
Is life good to you or is it bad?

One night to you  
Lasted six weeks for me  
Just a bitter little pill now  
Just to try to go to sleep  
No more waking up to innocence  
Say hello to hesitance  
To everyone I meet  
Thanks to you years ago  
I guess I'll never know  
What love means to me but oh  
I'll keep on rolling down this road  
But I've got a bad, bad feeling  
  
It's gonna take a long time to love  
It's gonna take a lot to hold on  
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now I've got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause it's gonna be a long long way to happy  
  
Left my childhood behind  
In a roll away bed  
Everything was so damn simple  
Now I'm losing my head(losing my head)  
Trying to cover up the damage  
And pad out all the bruises  
Too young to know I had it  
So it didn't hurt to lose it (didn't hurt to lose it)  
Didn't hurt to lose it (didm't hurt to lose it)  
No but oh  
I'll keep on rolling down this road  
But I've got a bad, bad feeling  
  
It's gonna take a long time to love  
It's gonna take a lot to hold on  
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now I've got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause it's gonna be a long long way  
  
Now I'm numb as hell and I can't feel a thing  
But don't worry about regret or guilt cause I never knew your name  
I just want to thank you  
Thank you  
From the bottem of my heart  
For all the sleepless nights  
And for tearing me apart yeah yeah  
  
It's gonna take a long time to love  
It's gonna take a lot to hold on  
It's gonna be a long way to happy, yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now I've got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause it's gonna be a long long way  
  
It's gonna take a long time to love  
It's gonna take a lot to hold on  
It's gonna be a long, long, long, long way to happy, yeah  
Left in the pieces that you broke me into  
Torn apart but now I've got to  
Keep on rolling like a stone  
Cause it's gonna be a long long way to happy

I've never written a love song  
That didn't end in tears  
Maybe you'll rewrite my love song  
If you can replace my fears  
I need your patience and guidance  
And all your lovin' and more  
When thunder rolls through my life  
Will you be able to weather the storm?  
There's so much I would give ya, baby  
If I'd only let myself  
There's this well of emotions  
I feel I must protect  
But what's the point of this armor  
If it keeps the love away, too?  
I'd rather bleed with cuts of love  
Than live without any scars  
Baby, can I trust this?  
Or do all things end?  
I need to hear that you'd die for me  
Again and again and again  
So tell me when you look in my eyes  
Can you share all the pain and happy times  
'Cause I will love you for the rest of my life  
This is my very first love song  
That didn't end in tears  
I think you re-wrote my love song  
For the rest of my years  
I will love you for the rest of my Life

I've got a way of making everything a confrontation  
And you've got a way of bringing out the worst in me  
You see, it's just if I'm bored  
I'll find a way to make an accusation  
I've got a problem with more  
So give me, give me everything  
  
STOP!  
  
Not my fault, not at all  
I can't help you what you want  
Get in line, take a number  
Get you when my song is over  
If you leave it up to me I'll make a lie out of truth  
It's true  
And then I'll break it up, make it bleed  
Tell you that it's you not me  
Make a scene at a show just because the wind blows  
Shoot myself in the foot to make a point I can't prove  
To get it back to you  
That's just my signature move  
  
You call me crazy and I think it's mean, I just don't like it  
I'm just a sensitive baby and you need to please me right  
You know I said I would change  
I did, I went and tried a different outfit  
And if that's not enough  
You won't be riding dirty tonight  
  
STOP!  
  
Not my fault, not at all  
I can't help you what you want  
Get in line, take a number  
Get you when my song is over

(That's just my signature move)  
(That's just my signature move)  
(That's just my signature move, uh)  
  
I start fight in my dreams I think I kick off the sheets  
I don't apologize they wouldn't see it in my eyes  
I'm not a good best friend  
If there's a rule I will bend  
That makes it trouble for you  
It's all I know how to do  
I'm not responsib... STOP!  
Ha-ha... yup!

Daddy was a soldier he taught me about freedom  
Peace and all the great things that we take  
Advantage of  
Once I fed the homeless, I'll never forget  
I look upon thier faces as I treated them with  
Respect  
And  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
Life keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
Momma was a lunitic, she liked to push my buttons  
  
She said I wasn't good enough, but I guess I  
Wasn't trying  
Never like school that much, they tried to teach  
Me better  
But I just wasn't hearing it because I thought I  
Was already pretty clever  
And  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
They keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
They keep on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
What do you expect from me?  
What am I not giving you?  
What could I do for you to make me ok in your  
Eyes?  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
They keep on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
I'm at war  
Life keeps on dropping bombs  
And I keep score  
  
This is my Vietnam  
This is my Vietnam

Please tell me what is taking place,  
Cause I can't seem to find a trace.  
Guess it must have got away somehow.  
Probably 'cause I always forget, everytime someone  
Tells me their name.  
It's always gotta' be the same  
  
In my world  
  
Never wore a cover up,  
Always beat the boys up.  
Grew up in a 5, 000 population town  
Made my money by cutting grass,  
Got fired by fried chicken ass  
All in a small town, Napanee.  
  
You know, I always stay up,  
Without sleeping, and think to myself.  
Where do I belong forever,  
In whose arms, the time and place?  
  
Chorus  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world  
  
I never spend less than an hour,  
Washing my hair in the shower.  
It always takes 5 hours to make it straight.  
So I braid in a zillion braids,  
Though it may take a friggin' day,  
There's nothing else better to do anyway.  
  
When you're all alone,  
In the lands of forever,  
Lay under the milky way.  
On and on, it's getting to late out,  
I'm not in love this time, this night.  
  
Chorus  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world.  
  
(La, La, La, La)  
  
Take sometime,  
Mellow out.  
Party up,  
But don't fall down.  
Don't get caught,  
Sneak out of the house.  
  
Chorus  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world  
  
Can't help it if I space in a daze,  
My eyes tune out the other way.  
I may switch off and go in a daydream.  
In this head my thoughts are deep,  
Sometimes I can't even speak.  
Would someone be and not pretend,  
I'm off again in my world.

[Hook: Pink]  
Every time you come to town you pick me up,  
Every time you come around you lit me up,  
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know]  
All I want to do is kick it from tonight  
All I ask is that you stay just one more night  
All I want is to here you say you want me  
  
[Benzino]  
See ain't nobody liver  
Like DC3 I'm a survivor  
I stay candid  
Four seat branded  
Front standard  
Dirt bandit with two cannons [bleow! ]  
Here's what the plans is  
A good life for me and my mans's  
In the studio paid off stanzas  
So in the long run  
Every song done gotta be bananas  
From city streets to corporate suits  
From these gritty beats  
All heat and nothing sweet  
Get a good look, I'm here to stay  
Benzino gonna show you how the big dogs play  
  
[Hook: Pink]  
Every time you come to town you pick me up,  
Every time you come around you lit me up,  
Even though you're not around you know you want me [you know]  
All I want to do is kick it from tonight  
All I ask is that you stay just one more night  
All I want is to here you say you want me  
  
[Benzino]  
Black ice on the neck and wrist [that's Benzino]  
Most hated at the top of the list [that's Benzino]  
Hangman with the gangsta hits [that's Benzino]  
Top dog that you never forget [that's Benzino]  
Watch me turn up the thermostat I burn it black  
I want the platinum plaque, y'all can have the game back  
Price of fame  
More friends more foes new Benz new clothes no sleep no doe  
Hate to see me doin it, love the chance to ruin it

No sleep, no sex for you from your ex-girlfriend  
I was too deep can't let you go and just jump in  
At times i would push my feelings aside to let you feel  
I'm novocaine i'm numb and nothing's real  
  
Like the coldest winter  
I am frozen from you  
  
I was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
I'm numb numb numb  
  
But the tears were silent inside you see  
But the tears were silent inside you see  
  
I laid there quiet  
And watched you have your way with me  
I might have cried  
But the tears were silent inside you see  
You called me names  
Made me feel like i was dumb  
I didn't feel a thing  
And now im gone gone gone  
  
Like a battered child  
I got used to your pain but you know it's cause  
  
I was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
Im numb numb numb  
  
I was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
Im numb numb numb numb numb numb  
  
Yeah yeah yeah  
Uhm da dum dum  
I don't feel a thing  
I don't feel the pain  
Numb  
  
Said i was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i can't feel much for you anymore  
I gave you my all my baby  
Im numb numb numb numb numb numb  
  
I was weak before now you've made me  
So numb i don't feel much for you anymore  
Said i gave you my all my baby  
Im numb numb numb  
  
I was weak before  
Said now im numb numb numb  
Oooooohh  
Nuuumb  
Uh uh no no  
  
Numb numb numb  
No no na no

Put me on the table  
Make me say your name  
If I can't remember  
Then give me all your pain  
I can sit and listen  
Or I can make you scream  
Kiss it and make it better  
Just put your trust in me  
  
[Chorus:]  
Oh my God, go a little slower  
Oh my God, what was that again  
La da da, let me feel you baby  
Let me in, 'cause I understand  
Let me feel you baby  
'Cause I understand  
  
[Rap]  
I understand all  
Now climb my sugar walls  
Problem solved it's dissolved  
With the solvent known as spit  
Lickity lick not so quick it's a  
Slick ride make my mink slide  
'Cause were all pink inside  
  
This can be really easy  
It doesn't have to be hard  
Here baby let me show you  
I'll have ya, climbing up the walls  
You got all the problems  
I think that I can solve  
Why don't you come in here baby  
Why don't we sit and talk  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
[Rap]  
You like the top and the bottom  
You make a drop and then caught 'em  
And when you rock then you've got 'em  
Oh my God 'em oh my God 'em  
  
[Ad libs]

Am I sweating?  
Or are these tears on my face?  
Should I be hungry?  
I can't remember the last time that I ate.  
Call someone  
I need a friend to talk me down  
  
But one foot wrong  
And I'm gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
Put one foot wrong  
And I'm gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
All the lights are on  
But I'm in the dark  
Who's gonna find me  
Who's gonna find me?  
Just one foot wrong  
You'll have to love me  
When I'm gone.  
  
Does anyone see this?  
Lucky me  
I guess I'm the chosen one  
Color and madness  
First in line I put my money down  
Some freedom  
Is the tiniest cell it's hell  
  
But one foot wrong  
And I'm gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
Put one foot wrong  
And I'm gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
All the lights are on  
But I'm in the dark  
Who's gonna find me  
Who's gonna find me?  
Just one foot wrong  
You'll have to love me  
When I'm gone.  
  
Some people find the beauty in all of this  
I go straight to the dark side, the abyss  
If it's bad  
Is it always my fault?  
Or did somebody bring me down?  
Or did somebody bring me down?  
Did somebody bring me down  
  
One foot wrong  
I'm gonna fall  
I put one foot wrong  
And I'm gonna fall  
Put one foot wrong  
I'm gonna fall  
Somebody gets it  
Somebody gets it  
Just one foot wrong  
All the lights are on  
But I'm in the dark  
Who's gonna find me  
Who's gonna find me  
Just one foot wrong  
You'll love me  
When I'm gone.  
  
Have to love me when I'm gone  
Love me when I'm gone  
You'll have to love me when I'm gone  
You'll have to love me when I'm gone

Sugarcult -Pretty girl(the way)  
  
Pretty girl is suffering, while he confesses everything  
Pretty soon she'll figure out what his intentions were about  
And that's what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
And that's what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
  
It's the way  
That he makes you feel  
It's the way  
That he kisses you  
It's the way  
That he makes you fall in love  
  
She's beautiful, as usual, with bruises on her ego and  
Her killer instinct tells her to beware of evil men  
And that's what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
And that's what you get for falling again  
You can never get him out of your head  
  
It's the way  
That he makes you feel  
It's the way  
That he kisses you  
It's the way  
That he makes you fall in love  
  
It's the way  
That he makes you feel  
It's the way  
That he kisses you  
It's the way  
That he makes you fall in love...love...  
  
(Musical Interlude)  
  
Pretty girl...  
Pretty girl...

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Silly you, silly me  
To let you in and put a move on me  
(Put a move on me)  
Never once asked for love  
Always took it for what it's worth... A memory  
  
1 But I don't wanna meet on a lonely street  
Where the talk is cheap  
And the price is sweet  
I'm not that girl  
I'm not that girl  
And you don't wanna see the other side of me  
So I'mma hit ya off and I'mma set you free  
Before you fall too deep  
Don't fall too deep  
  
2 - He don't know

I'll let him go  
Cause all he wants from me is a private show, whoa  
  
He's all talk

How this game is supposed to go... For everyone  
Still it seems he can't see  
Thinks he's just using me, using me  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Repeat 2

Goes "Beep-beep"

Mine  
When I pass you in a club, "Ooh, lala!" you gasp  
Back up boy, I ain't your toy, or your piece of  
Ass

Unconditionally

Remember make believe in you  
All the things I said I'd do  
I wouldn't hurt you, like the world did me  
Keep you safe, I'd keep you sweet  
Everything that I went through,  
I'm greatful you won't have to do  
I know that you will have to fall  
I can't hide you from it all  
  
[Chorus:]  
But take the best of what I've got  
And you know no matter what  
Before you walk away, you know you can  
Run, run, run,  
Back to my arms, back to my arms  
Run, run, run, back to my arms and they will hold you down  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh [x4]  
  
See, here's the bloody, bloody truth  
You will hurt and you will lose  
I've got scars you won't believe  
Wear them proudly on my sleeve  
I hope you'll have the sense to know  
That sadness comes and sadness goes  
Love so hard and play life loud  
It's the only thing to give a damn about  
  
[Chorus:]  
But take the best of what I've got  
And you know no matter what  
Before you walk away, you know you can  
Run, run, run,  
Back to my arms, back to my arms  
Run, run, run,  
Back to my arms and they will hold you down  
  
All this time I swear I'll never waste it  
All your smiles I'm always gonna save them  
Put it in the back of my mind  
Whenever I'm away from you [x2]  
  
Run, run, run  
Back to your arms, back to your arms  
Run, run, run  
Back your arms and they will hold you  
Whoa, whoa, whoa  
Back to my arms, back to my arms  
  
All this time I swear I'll never waste it  
All your smiles I'm always gonna save them  
Put it in the back of my mind  
Back to my arms, and they will hold you down  
Oh oh, oh oh, oh oh, oh oh [x2]

She's back on drugs again  
Even though she knows it ain't right  
She can't even call up her friends  
And say "help me save my life"  
She's so ashamed of herself that she's come full circle  
Nobody understands what it's like to  
Be this girl  
So she disappeared, and she  
Wasn't clear, and she  
Didn't say where she was going  
  
[Chorus:]  
Save my life, won't you help me  
Save my life, won't you help me  
Save my life, won't you hear me  
Save my life, won't you help me  
  
She had the man of her dreams  
And some success  
And she was so happy, and looking well  
It was this one dark night, that she  
Slipped  
And then the next morning that she  
Felt like a piece of shit  
So she's hanging out, and she's  
With the crowd, and she's  
Travelin' where the wind is blowing  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
And he's a real good guy and he  
Wants to save her 'cause he's  
More than been there all before  
And she's so confused and his heart is breaking and he  
Dreams she's knocking on his door  
  
[Chorus:]

[Intro]  
Na na na na na, na na na na na.  
Na na na na na, na na na na na.  
  
[Verse 1]  
I guess I just lost my husband, I don't know where he went.  
So I'm gonna drink my money, I'm not gonna pay his rent (nope).  
I've got a brand new attitude, and I'm gonna wear it tonight.  
I'm gonna get in trouble, I wanna start a fight.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Na na na na na,  
I wanna start a fight.  
Na na na na na,  
I wanna start a fight!  
  
[Chorus]  
So, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't need you!  
And guess what?  
I'm havin more fun, and now that were done,  
I'm gonna show you tonight!  
I'm alright, I'm just fine,  
And you're a tool so, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't want you tonight!  
  
Unh Check my flow Uohhh  
  
[Verse 2]  
The waiter just took my table and gave it to Jessica Simps (shit!)  
I guess I'll go sit with drum boy, at least he'll know how to hit (oops)  
What if this song's on the radio, then somebody's gonna die! (haha)  
I'm going to get in trouble, my ex will start a fight.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Na na na na,  
He's gonna to start a fight.

We're all gonna get in a fight!

And I don't need you!  
And guess what?

And you're a tool so, so what?  
I am a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't want you tonight!  
  
[Bridge]  
You weren't there, you never were,  
You want it all but that's not fair.  
I gave you life, I gave my all,  
You weren't there, you let me fall!  
  
[Chorus:]  
So, so what?  
I'm still a rock star, I got my rock moves (my rock moves),  
And I don't need you (and I don't need you)!  
And guess what (and guess what)?  
I'm havin more fun, and now that were done (were done),

[Outro]  
No, no,  
No no, I don't want you tonight!  
You weren't there...  
I'm gonna show you tonight!  
I'm alright (I'm alright), I'm just fine  
And you're a tool so, so what?  
I am a rock star, I got my rock moves,  
And I don't want you tonight!  
  
(Wooohooooooo!)  
Ba da da da pffftt

I don't wanna be the girl who laughs the loudest  
Or the girl who never wants to be alone  
I don't wanna be there calling 4 o'clock in the morning  
Cause I'm the only one you know in the world that won't be home  
  
Ah, the sun is blinding  
I stayed up again  
Oh, I am finding  
That that's not the way I want my story to end  
  
I'm safe  
Up high  
Nothing can touch me  
But why do I feel this party's over?  
No pain  
Inside  
You're my protection  
But how do I feel this good sober?  
  
I don't wanna be the girl that has to fill the silence  
The quiet scares me 'cause it screams the truth  
Please don't tell me that we had that conversation  
Cause I won't remember, save your breath, 'cause what's the use?  
  
Ah, the night is calling?  
And it whispers to me softly come and play  
But I, I am falling  
And If I let myself go I'm the only one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm safe  
Up high  
Nothing can touch me  
But why do I feel this party's over?  
No pain  
Inside  
You're like perfection  
But how do I feel this good sober?  
  
Coming down, coming down, coming down  
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round  
I'm looking for myself, sober  
Coming down, coming down, coming down  
Spinning 'round, spinning 'round, spinning 'round  
Looking for myself, sober  
  
When it's good, then it's good, it's so good 'till it goes bad  
'Till you're trying to find the you that you once had  
I have heard myself cry, never again  
Broken down in agony just tryin' to find a friend  
  
Oh,  
Oh,  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]

Chorus  
Wake up in the morning go to work  
Fire up the truck and drive to Sonoma  
Hop on the forklift  
Fill up the truck with ten thousand pounds of newspaper  
Ten thousand pounds of racist, trash, and lies  
Drive the truck back to Santa Rosa put the newspaper in the recycle  
So the rich white man can print out the same batch of lies  
Again and again and again and again and again and again and again  
  
It's too bad the cops had to kill that man  
But he had a broomstick and he was Asian  
We know they're all samurai warriors  
They're all kung fu masters  
They're all just like Jackie Chan  
It's too bad the cops had to restrain his wife  
Cause she was a registered nurse and she tried to save his life  
But that would go against rules and regulations  
To just forget at 2 at night  
We're so proud of our boys in blue  
Cause they always do what's right  
I saw Eileen today  
I saw her children play in the courtyard  
Lately it occurred to me  
How does a mama tell her children their dad got killed by the police?  
  
Chorus  
  
It's too bad the cops had to kill that kid  
But someone called in a stolen walkman  
The cops they chased him down but he refused to lie face on the ground  
And he just walked away  
The cop said, "This punk can't walk away in the all black night  
So I had to shoot him in the back of the head  
From fifty feet away  
I had to kill him it was self defense  
I was afraid he would circle back around and kill me. "  
I saw Corneleus speak today at the Hayward High  
That other police stole his sons life away  
Over a walkman that wasn't that much more than change  
How does a father find justice for a son stolen away?  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
Stolen away  
I don't want to hear your news cast anymore cause it's bullshit  
I don't want to see your headlines anymore cause they're bullshit  
I don't want to hear your press release anymore cause it's bullshit  
I don't want to see your police report anymore cause it's bullshit

La da la la la  
La da la la la la ooh  
  
1 I ain't lookin' for a steady thing  
I ain't looking for what love brings  
Cause I'm still young and I ain't ready babe  
I'm still looking for some better days  
I don't wanna give you everything  
I just wanna make you feel things  
If you ain't down to give me everything  
Just throw it away, hey  
  
Don't assume cause I'm a woman that'll fall in love  
Don't expect I'm young and need to be took care of  
Don't wanna hear you got what I need  
Cause how would you know before we speak?  
  
You've gotta understand my side  
I've had a crazy, crazy life  
Nobody came along to open up my eyes  
You better take what you can get  
Don't even bother with my heart  
I get a feeling I won't let dissolve  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Please believe me  
I've been down this road and back again  
Learned a lesson and it was that love is not my friend  
The day I put my trust in you  
Will be the day I say I do  
Don't expect me just to open up  
Maybe I'm just a little scared  
Please don't tell me what you think  
I wanna hear  
Oh baby save it  
I've heard it all before  
There ain't nothing you could say  
Oh to make me change, no way  
  
Repeat 1  
  
So stop falling, stop falling  
You know you're falling for me  
Stop falling, stop falling  
Stop falling for me, yeah  
  
You've gotta understand my side  
I've had a crazy, crazy life  
Nobody came along to open up my eyes  
Oh, baby take what you can get  
Don't even bother with my heart  
I get a feeling I won't let dissolve  
  
Repeat 1  
  
Stop falling, oh, hey, oh, oh yeah  
Baby

[Verse 1]  
I can understand how when the edges are rough,  
And they cut you like the tiniest slithers of glass.  
And you feel too much,  
And you don't know how long you're gonna last.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Find a way to make the heart go away.  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Like you're trying to scream underwater.  
  
[Chorus]  
But, I won't let you make the great escape,  
I'm never gonna watch you checkin' out of this place.  
I'm not gonna lose you, cause the passion and the pain,  
Are gonna keep you alive someday.  
Gonna keep you alive someday.  
  
[Verse 2]  
I feel like I could wave my fist in front of your face,  
And you wouldn't flinch or even feel a thing.  
And you've retreated to your silent corner,  
Like you decided the fight was over for ya.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Find a way to make the heart go away.  
Everyone you know, is tryin' smooth it over,  
Everyone needs a floor they can fall through!  
  
[Chorus]  
I won't let you make the great escape,  
I'm never gonna watch you checkin' outta this place.  
I'm not gonna lose you, cause the passion and pain,  
Are gonna keep you alive someday.  
They're gonna keep you alive someday.  
  
[Bridge]  
I'm terrified of the dark, but not if you go with me,  
And I don't need a pill to make me numb.  
And I wrote the book on runnin',  
But that chapter of my life will soon be done.  
  
[Outro]  
I'm the king of the great escape,  
You're not gonna watch me checkin' outta this place.  
You're not gonna lose me, cause the passion and pain,  
Are gonna keep us alive someday.  
Yeah, the passion and the pain are gonna keep us alive  
Someday, someday.

Mmmm mm yeah  
Oh oh  
I stood by the exit door of the hotel cafe  
He was playing with his band  
I've always been a sucker had a weakness for a boy with a guitar and a drink
in his hand  
His words were like heaven in my hurricane  
My knees buckled under  
I thought everyone was watching me  
Watching you save my life with the song  
  
You were mine  
In the back of my mind  
Oh just for one night  
Just for a while  
  
There's always one that gets away  
The one that sneaks up on you that slips away  
  
Two weeks later I was sitting in his apartment  
He was making cappuchino  
I said what kind of man makes cappuchino  
We laughed  
We laughed  
We laughed  
We laughed til tears ran down my face  
  
Oh but my man you're someone elses man  
And that aint the man that I want  
But you keep drawing me in with those big brown lion eyes  
  
You'll always be mine  
In the back of my mind  
Oh we had a night  
Just a little wine  
  
There's always one that gets away  
The one that sneaks up on you that slips away  
  
In a closed off corner of my heart yes  
I'll always see your face  
The one that got away  
One that got away  
The one that got away  
The one that got away  
Oh the one that got away  
The one that got away  
Oh the one that got away  
The one that got away  
Oh the one that got away  
Yeah yeah  
Oh oh oh oh  
Yeah yeah  
Oh  
  
I'm not a victim of cliches  
I don't believe in soul mates  
Happy endings only one  
Oh and I met you and all that changed  
I had a taste and you're still sitting on the tip of my tongue  
  
You were mine  
Somewhere in time  
I'll look for you first  
In my next life  
  
There's always one that gets away  
The one that sneaks up on you that slips away  
Slips away  
In a closed off corner of my heart yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I I'll always see your face  
The one that got away  
The one that got away  
The one that got away  
The one that got away  
Oh the one that got away  
The one that got away  
Oh the one that got away  
The one that got away  
The one that got away  
Yeah yeah  
Oh oh yeah  
The one that got away

The truth about love comes at 3am  
You wake up fucked up and you grab a pen  
And you say to yourself  
I'm gonna figure it out, I'm gonna crack that code  
Gonna break it break it down  
I'm tired of all these questions  
And, now it's just annoying  
Cause, no one has the answer  
So I guess it's up to me  
To find the truth about love  
As it comes, and it goes  
A strange fascination with his lips and toes  
Morning breath, bedroom eyes on a smiling face  
Sheet marks rug burn, and a sugar glaze  
The shock and the awe that can eat you raw  
If the truth about love  
  
I think it just may be perfect  
You're the person of my dreams  
I never ever ever ever been this happy  
But now something has changed  
And The Truth About Love is it's all a lie  
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes  
  
Oh, you want the truth?  
  
The truth about love is it's nasty and salty  
It's the regret in the morning, it's the smelling of armpits  
It's wings, and songs  
And trees, and birds  
It's all the poetry that you ever heard  
Terror coup d'etat, life line forget-me-nots  
It's the hunt and the kill  
The schemes and the plots  
The truth about love is it's blood, and it's guts  
Purebreds and mutts  
Sandwiches without the crust  
It takes your breath, cause it leaves a scar  
But those untouched never got never got very far  
It's rage and it's hate  
And a sick twist of fate  
And that's the truth about love  
The truth about love  
  
I think it just may be perfect  
You're the person of my dreams  
I never ever ever ever been this happy  
But now something has changed  
And The Truth About Love is it's all a lie  
I thought you were the one, and I hate goodbyes  
  
Oh you can lose your breath and  
Oh, you can shoot a gun and  
Convince you're the only one that's ever felt this way before  
It hurts inside the hurt within and  
It folds together pocket thin and  
It's whispered by the angels' lips and  
It can turn you into a son of a bitch man  
  
The truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth, the truth, the truth about love is  
Truth about love

[Verse 1]  
Please don't come around talking 'bout that you love me,  
Cause that love shit just ain't for me.  
I don't wanna hear that you adore me,  
And I know that all you're doing is running your mind games,  
Don't you know that game repeats game?  
So your best bet is to be straight with me.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So you say you wanna talk, let's talk,  
If you won't talk, I'll walk.  
Yeah it's like that.  
I gotta new man, he's waiting out back,  
Now what, what you think about that?  
Now when I say I'm through, I'm through,  
Basically I'm through with you,  
What you wanna say?  
Had to have it your way, had to play games,  
Now you're begging me to stay.  
  
[Chorus]  
There you go, looking pitiful,  
Just because I let you go.  
There you go, talking about you want me back,  
But sometimes it be's like that.  
There you go, talking bout you miss me so,  
That you love me so, why I let you go,  
There you go, cause your lies got old,  
Now look at you, there you go.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Please don't come around talking bout how you changed,  
How you said goodbye to what's-her-name,  
All it sounds like to me is new game.  
And I was right when I thought I'd be much better off without you,  
Had to get myself from around you,  
Cause my life was all about you.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
So you say you wanna talk, I don't,  
Say you wanna change, I won't,  
Yeah it's like that, had your chance,  
Won't take you back, now what,  
What you think about that?  
And when I say I'm through, I'm through,  
Basically I'm through with you.  
What you wanna say?  
Had to have it your way, had to play games,  
Now you're begging me to stay.  
  
[Chorus]  
There you go, looking pitiful,  
Just because I let you go.  
There you go, talking about you want me back,  
But sometimes it be's like that.  
So there you go, talking bout you miss me so,  
That you love me so, why I let you go,  
There you go, cause your lies got old,  
Now look at you, there you go.  
  
[Bridge]  
Don't you wish you could turn the hands of time?  
Don't you wish that you still were mine?  
Don't you wish I'd take you back?  
Don't you wish that things were simple like that, oh?  
Didn't miss a good thing till it's gone,  
But I knew it wouldn't be long,  
Till you came running back,  
Missing my love, there you go!  
  
[Chorus]  
There you go, looking pitiful,  
Just because I let you go.  
There you go, talking about you want me back,  
But sometimes it be's like that.  
So there you go, talking bout you miss me so,  
That you love me so, why I let you go,  
There you go, cause your lies got old,  
Now look at you, there you go.

[Verse 1]  
Sometimes I hate every single stupid word you say,  
Sometimes I wanna slap you in your whole face.  
There's no one quite like you,  
You push all my buttons down.  
I know life would suck without you.  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
At the same time, I wanna hug you,  
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck.  
You're an asshole, but I love you,  
And you make me so mad I ask myself  
Why I'm still here, or where could I go  
You're the only love I've ever known.  
But I hate you, I really hate you,  
So much I think it must be  
  
[Chorus]  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
Nothing else can break my heart like  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
No one else can break my heart like you.  
  
[Verse 2]  
Just once try to wrap your little brain around my feelings,  
Just once please try not to be so mean.  
Repeat after me now are R-O-M-A-N-C-EEE,  
Come on I'll say it slowly (romance).  
You can do it baby!  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
At the same time, I wanna hug you,  
I wanna wrap my hands around your neck.  
You're an asshole, but I love you,  
And you make me so mad I ask myself  
Why I'm still here, or where could I go  
You're the only love I've ever known.  
But I hate you, I really hate you,  
So much I think it must be  
  
[Chorus]  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
Nothing else can break my heart like  
True love, true love,  
It must be true love.  
No one else can break my heart like you.  
  
[Hook]  
(I love you, I think it must be love, I love you)  
Why do you rub me up the wrong way?  
Why do you say the things that you say?  
Sometimes I wonder how we ever came to be,  
But without you I'm incomplete.  
  
[Outro]  
(I think it must be)  
True love (it must be), true love,  
It must be true love (it must be)  
Nothing else can break my heart like.  
True love (it must be), true love,  
It must be true love.  
And no one else can break my heart like you (like you),  
No one else can break my heart like you (like you),  
No one else can break my heart like you.

[Verse:]  
I hide my pain like the rest of them  
That's why I'm always laughing  
I'm troubled, I'm brilliant and miserable too  
That's why I am so funny  
I swallow down all my fears  
With a bottle made of silver  
I've only been here for 27 years  
But already my life is over  
  
[Chorus 1]  
And I need to unwind, yes, and I  
I need to unwind, yes, and I  
Want all the time  
To be loved, to unwind  
  
[Verse 2:]  
My life is like a fairytale  
That nobody believes in  
I can't remember anything  
Not the people, not the places I've been  
Just one more day you can make it, babe  
That's what I tell myself  
And everything that I love in life  
It is killing me, 'cause it's bad for my health  
  
[Chorus 2:]  
Somebody comfort me  
S... Southern comfort me  
Somebody comfort me  
S... Southern comfort me  
  
[Chorus 1(3x)]  
[Chorus 2(out)]

Check it out, so though  
No more, not this time, not again  
  
You told me everything would get along  
But everything is falling apart  
Now if you understand me don't get me wrong  
'cause there's something dark inside my heart  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need, yeah  
That's what I got  
  
Now boy we can keep it loud  
So please don't turn it out  
Whispers sweet, get mine  
Laying over the base-line  
  
Whatever it is, I'm no affraid  
To whoever listen to this  
I don't fear you  
To all your fellas  
Go back to your girlfriends  
Bounce it, twist it  
Better dip that thing!  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling  
What I need, yeah  
That's what I got  
  
Better get it off my back  
Get it on with the check  
Temptations and vibrations  
Keeps me falling

Can't keep me down  
Can't keep me down, down  
Can't keep me down  
  
I said, you can't keep me down  
You know you can't keep me down  
I said, you can't keep me down  
  
Hey, hey, man! What's your problem?  
I see you tryin' to hurt me bad  
Don't know what you're up against  
  
Maybe, you should reconsider  
Come up with another plan  
'Cause you know I'm not that kinda girl  
That'll lay there and let you come first  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give a fuck  
  
You can hang me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down, down  
  
Can't keep me down, down  
You can't keep me down, down, down  
Can't keep me down, down  
  
Hey, hey, girl! Are you ready for today?  
You got your shield and sword?  
'Cause it's time to play the games  
  
You are beautiful  
Even though you're not for sure  
Don't let him pull you by the scar  
You're gonna get your feelings hurt  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give a fuck  
  
You can hang me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down, down

And I won't give a fuck  
  
You can hang me like a slave  
I'll go underground  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler but  
You can't keep me down, down, down, down  
  
Everywhere that I go  
There's someone waitin' to chain me  
Everything that I say  
There's someone tryin' to short change me  
  
I am only this way  
Because of what you have made me  
And I'm not gonna break  
  
You can push me out the window  
I'll just get back up  
You can run over me with your 18 wheeler truck  
And I won't give a fuck

[Original by Jefferson Airplane]  
  
One pill makes you larger  
And one pill makes you small  
And the ones that mother gives you  
Don't do anything at all  
Go ask Alice  
When she's ten feet tall  
  
And if you go chasing rabbits  
And you know you're going to fall  
Tell 'em a hookah smoking caterpillar  
Has given you the call...  
Call Alice  
When she was just small  
  
When the men on the chessboard  
Get up and tell you where to go  
And you've just had some kind of mushroom  
And your mind is moving low  
Go ask Alice  
I think she'll know  
  
When logic and proportion  
Have fallen sloppy dead  
And the White Knight is talking backwards  
And the Red Queen's off with her head  
Remember what the Dormouse said  
Feed your head  
Feed your head  
Feed your head

Barabarabaraadada  
There was a 5. 8 earthquake today  
And it kinda got me thinking  
I'd still have all  
My hate for you in tact  
Even if I lost everything  
  
What did I say  
Why are you shaking your head  
You know you done me wrong  
I may be crazy it's all in my head  
But I want you darling gone  
  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was must  
Have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me  
  
Eh eh eh eh  
  
(Repeats for a bit)  
  
It's hard to believe  
I ever laughed at anything you said  
Cos you're just not funny  
Who would believe  
I'd let you do all those things  
Oh I guess the joke was on me  
  
I tried to be zane  
I've even asked all my friends  
To help my let it slide  
But all I see is your face  
In my favourite place  
And I can't help but wonder why  
  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was  
Must have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me  
  
Eh eh eh eh (repeats for a bit)  
  
Yeaaahhheee  
  
I tried to be zane  
I've even asked all my friends  
To help my let it slide  
All I see is your face  
In my favourite place  
And I can't help but wonder why  
  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was must  
Have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me  
  
Eh eh eh eh (repeats for a bit)  
  
Tell me why did I  
Why did I ever like you  
What did I see  
Whatever it was must  
Have been some kind of illusion  
A Magic trick on me

So, so you think you can tell  
Heaven from Hell,  
Blue skys from pain.  
Can you tell a green field  
From a cold steel rail?  
A smile from a veil?  
Do you think you can tell?  
  
And did they get you to trade  
Your heros for ghosts?  
Hot ashes for trees?  
Hot air for a cool breeze?  
Cold comfort for change?  
And did you exchange  
A walk on part in the war  
For a lead role in a cage?  
  
How I wish, how I wish you were here.  
We're just two lost souls  
Swimming in a fish bowl,  
Year after year,  
Running over the same old ground.  
And had we found?  
The same old fears.  
Wish you were here.

Take Y  
Take the letter  
Take it out on the alphabet  
Don't ask me why  
No more questions  
Just accept it for the way it is  
  
Words are just words  
They get in my way  
I can never say what I wanna say  
Who will understand it anyway?  
It's just a waste  
  
Take M  
Mmm mmm  
It's so lovely, so delicious, it says it all  
  
I don't like X  
Ex-boyfriends, ex-girlfriends  
Exactly what I don't need  
Twisting my words so easily  
  
Words are just words  
They get in my way  
See like right now, I wanna tell you that I love you  
But I don't know how..  
  
Put the H with the A with the TE,  
Give it power, you could destroy me  
Put the L, with the O with the VE,  
Give that power and you don't have to say anything  
  
Words are just words  
They get in my way  
Bla bla bla bla  
Blaaaa  
  
Words are just words  
They get in my way  
Words are just words  
They get in my way  
  
Take B,  
And just let it be, B...
