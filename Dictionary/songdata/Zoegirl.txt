I've been thinking lately about you  
When it hit me from nowhere  
Out of the gray  
Everything's been coming together  
Now that I've moved beyond myself  
And wrapped my head around something else  
  
It's not about me it's gotta be about you  
(and everyday I) and all I want to see is who your turning me into  
(and every way) I will not forget that you said you'd always bring me through  
To who I want to be making every part of me  
About you (every part of me about you, ya)  
  
I've been spending so much time disconnected  
I was searching for perfection inside myself  
But I finally turned away from my reflection (my reflection)  
And saw your world outside my door  
And everything that I'm looking for!  
  
It's not about me it's gotta be about you  
(and everyday I) and all I want to see is who your turning me into  
(and every way) I will not forget that you said you'd always bring me through  
To who I want to be making every part of me  
About you  
  
So I lay down my pride  
Cause you laid down your life  
And I'm giving up all that's holding me back  
And lead me too you  
And you lead me through, like you always do  
  
It's not about me it's gotta be about you  
(and everyday I) and all I want to see is who your turning me into  
(and every way) I will not forget that you said you'd always bring me through  
To who I want to be making every part of me  
About you (every part of me about you, ya)

I know that you've been thinking  
I see it in your eyes  
You're holding on to something  
But still you don't know why  
So walk by faith and not by what you see  
Trust your heart and let yourself believe  
  
[Chorus]  
I can do things, things you never knew  
Change your world, make it all brand new  
I can do miracles if you want me too  
Anything is possible for you  
  
Anything, anything, anything, anything is possible  
Repeat  
  
I know your heart's been broken  
You feel so all alone  
But I will never leave you lonely  
I'll never let you go  
So walk by faith and not by what you see  
It's up to you to let your heart believe  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If I can make the Heavens  
IF I can make it rain  
If I can make your heart beat  
Then I can ease your pain  
If I'm the only answer, the only one that's right  
Tell me why are you still searching?  
Why do you still fight?  
When I can do  
  
[Chorus]

I used to close my eyes and pray the time would pass me by  
So I could fly away in my dreams to anywhere unreal  
And I'd hide away from everything  
I didn't know what was real, I didn't know the truth  
There was a day when somebody introduced me to You  
And You breathed Your life in me  
You set me free  
  
Now I'll shout it from the mountain  
That I'm not the same that I used to be  
I believe in God, believe in God  
I'm not ashamed to talk about it  
To a world that slowly slips away  
That I believe in God, believe in God  
  
Now at the end of the day when nothing seems to go my way  
I've got a friend, I've got a love that's never gonna let me go  
Since You gave Your life for me  
You set me free  
  
Oh, when I feel so alone  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay  
Oh, when my emotions flow  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay  
  
Oh, when I feel so alone  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay  
Oh, when my emotions flow  
He comes to sweetly say  
It's all gonna be okay

I got a new way of thinking  
I finally figured it out  
It's coming from a different perspective  
I wanna tell you what it's about  
And I'm all right now (all right now)  
Cause it's You I've found  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
I got a new motivation  
I never knew how good it could be  
It's better than a standing ovation  
And nothings gonna take it from me  
And I'll be fine (I'll be fine)  
Cause You're by my side  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
It's contagious  
It's outrageous  
You can put it in your pocket for another day  
You can hide it in a box or keep it locked away  
But when it's in your heart you'll find  
You don't have to wonder why  
You won't need a vision  
You won't need a sign  
It's something I can't define  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
Yeah, Your love's contagious and I've caught it  
Can't wipe this smile off my face, it's something I can't explain  
Yeah, Your joy's outrageous and I got it  
I'm leaving worries behind, it's something I can't describe  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  
Singin' na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na na  

Broken hearts, broken homes  
There's a war deep in motion  
Fighting hard to find  
Some kind of peace of mind  
  
Breathing in, breathing out  
Missing life, living doubt  
Searching for a cure  
Some kind of open door  
  
Bring it back to the beginning  
To the first taste of shame  
A fallen world in waiting  
Only one could take the blame  
  
Fast forward to the ending  
One truth remains  
There's a miracle waiting  
For all who speak His name  
  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
  
And they can't take it from me  
Pleading the most worthy cause  
For the innocence we lost  
With his tears of blood  
  
He started freedom's flood  
As the world's opinions sway  
My beliefs will not be changed  
Nothing ever can take me from His hand  
  
Bring it back to the beginning  
To the first taste of shame  
A fallen world in waiting  
Only one could take the blame  
  
Fast forward to the ending  
One truth remains  
There's a miracle waiting  
For all who speak His name  
  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
  
And they can't take it from me  
Yeah, sure I remember  
Matter fact it was just last September  
She still calls it the fall to remember  
  
Little Heather when it all came together  
Said you remember the first time you met us?  
She cried when it rained and blamed the weather  
But inside she strained with suicide letters  
  
The kind of cold you couldn't warm with a sweater  
Hardly lasted past December  
Said she was headed down to defeat  
That's the last you'd seen, and never had dreamed  
  
That's the same little Heather It's who you saw last week  
In an instant you couldn't have missed her gleam  
As she listened She looked like a distant queen  
With a difference there for all to see  
  
She found a different, a different kind of free  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
  
It's a different kind of free  
And they can't take it from me  
Take my life, my liberty  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
And they can't take it from me  
Take my life, my liberty  
  
It's all but a breath in the grand scheme of things  
Oh, I have found eternity  
It's a different kind of free  
And they can't take it from me  
  
It's so much different  
It's a different kind of free  
And it's here for you and me  
It's a different kind of free  
  
And it's here to set you free  
It's a different kind of free

How many times have you tried to pull one over on me?  
Always mess with me and try to get the best of me  
Lookin' back, all the pain that you put me through  
Why would i fall for a fool like you?  
Now you're talkin' like I've never played the game before  
Save your empty words 'cause I don't want to hear no more  
Basically you're trying to take control of me  
But you're not what i want to be  
  
I know everything about you  
Yesterday has come and gone  
I'd be better off without you  
No lookin' back, I'm moving on!  
  
You'll never steal the song of my lips  
I'll never bow down to give you a kiss, no  
You'll never steal my innocence  
You've been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
I'm never going back even if I see you around, no  
No, I'm never going down like this  
You've been dismissed  
  
Let me break it down one more time  
No, you're never gonna change my mind  
That was thenm this is now things are different, no  
Oh, you're not what I'm livin' for  
  
I know everything about you  
It's funny how the tables turned  
I'd be better off without you  
Now you're the one who's gettin' burned!  
  
You'll never steal the song of my lips  
I'll never bow down to give you a kiss, no  
You'll never steal my innocence  
You've been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
I'm never going back even if I see you around, no  
No, I'm never going down like this  
You've been dismissed  
  
On a falling star you got to where you are  
And you think you've got the right to own my heart  
But my affection doesn't lie in your direction  
You want to hold me with a lock and key  
Cover my eyes so i cannot see  
But in the end we all know who wins  
You are over, over, over  
  
You'll never steal the song of my lips  
I'll never bow down to give you a kiss, no  
You'll never steal my innocence  
You've been dismissed  
Do your best to try to pull me down  
I'm never going back even if I see you around, no  
No, I'm never going down like this  
You've been dismissed

Stranded in the middle of a hurricane  
I've got an umbrella but nowhere to stay  
Do I give up now, do I face the cold  
I better get some boldness  
Looking to the left I see it coming  
I'm alone and I'm scared and it's heading my way  
Do I run, do I hide, do I dare close my eyes  
Do I face the fear inside  
Time after time  
Lord, I'll keep running back to you  
Keep running back to you  
I, I realize this time that I'll be fine  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken  
Landed in the middle of the desert  
And I'm wondering why what keeps me alive  
When the water I drink  
And the air that I breathe is dry  
Time after time  
Lord, I'll keep running back to you  
Keep running back to you  
I, I realize this time that I'll be fine  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken  
Even in the darkest night  
I know I'll be alright  
The world is bound to change  
But you always stay the same  
You give me joy, you give me hope  
You give me love that doesn't change  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken  
Even if the stars fell like rain  
Even if tomorrow never came  
Even if the world I know should crumble  
Nothing's gonna stand in my way  
Even if the sun left the sky  
And even if these tears never dry  
Even if the mountains fall and tumble  
If what's left of me is taken, I will not be shaken  

Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright,yeah (You feel alright,yeah,sio what are you waiting for?)-  
Celebrity and superstition  
Whatever it takes to get some recognition  
Selling antiques like they are new ideas  
Making you pay to feed the thoughts they steal  
Call me foolish call me crazy  
But all this drama doesn't faze me  
Tell me not to run and I will run much faster  
Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout it from a mountain  
Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright,yeah (You feel alright,yeah,sio what are you waiting for?)-  
It doesn't take a mathematician  
To calculate our rising addicition  
To romance,youth and perfected beauty  
Packaged preservered for their mass apeal  
You're not the first to buy their lines  
They're not the last to waste your time  
Tell me to give up and I will fight much harder  
Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout it even louder  
Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright,yeah (You feel alright,yeah,so what are you waiting for?)-  
It's a new day  
Different then yesterday  
All the concepts fighting for a place in my mind  
Well you'll find It's occupied with the divine  
The sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more  
The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar  
Time will be flying and freedom is at the door  
You feel alright,yeah,so get up...  
Sun is shining (sun is shining there's no need to sleep no more)  
Day is bright,yeah (The day is bright and your heart has it's wings to soar)  
It's a new day (Time wil be flying,freedom is at the door)  
Feel alright, yeah (You feel alright, yeah, so what are you waiting for?) -
[2x]  

Never thought it would be me  
Living in a shattered dream  
How could this be the end for me?  
What I wouldn't give to have  
  
A life to live  
A day to plan  
Instead I'll be Forever 17  
Could've lived out every dream  
Could've been most anything  
  
[Chorus]  
Can someone wake me up?  
I haven't lived yet, I'm only 17.  
God did you forget  
I'm just a baby and I don't want to be  
Forever 17  
  
I'll never have a bed to make  
A test to take  
A summer day  
I'll always be Forever 17  
  
Could've had a family  
If things had worked differently  
Instead I'll be Forever 17  
Could I have just one more day?  
A chance to learn from my mistakes?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
In a matter of a moment  
Life fell before my eyes  
Now I'm looking at the meaning of the miracle of life  
Where were we going without even knowing the answer deep inside?  
  
Forever 17  
  
So don't give up  
You haven't lived yet  
You're only 17  
  
And God did not forget  
You're just a baby...

Oh, God, in Your perfection Your love confounds the wise  
Sinners are made heroes, and the humble lifted high  
Unchained hearts are singing out  
Songs that reach the sky  
  
Lift up your eyes to the One who reigns  
Lift up your hands, oh sweet surrender it brings  
Forevermore, You are holy  
Forevermore, You are worthy  
  
In Your light we see light, in Your eyes we shine  
You give strength and justice, and the broken are made right  
Sinners, saints, and angels sing  
Songs that reach the sky  
  
All my life, all that I hope  
It rests inside Your plan  
Your love, Your grace, Your truth alone  
Forevermore will stand  
  
You have called me Your redeemed  
And hidden me in the shadow of Your wings  
Peace like a river  
Joy like a fountain flows wherever You go

Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
I've tried so hard to change your mind  
I always thought that you'd understand the reasons why  
Why I don't want to do the things that I used to do  
Now that my heart and my soul belong to God and God alone  
Still every night's a fight to make it through  
I can't deny I'm still in love with you  
But how can you expect me to  
Walk with Him and give myself to you  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
Boy, I still long for your embrace  
But what I've found in God, oh, it could never ever be replaced  
Still I pray for the chance  
As you slip through my hands you'll come around  
But your heart's so far away from the words I'm trying to say  
Wish I could hold you both and still be true  
There's only one thing left for me to do  
Baby, I love you  
But I can't stay with you unless you love Him too  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
I've found the path that I've gotta take  
No turning back, back to the old ways  
Got a chance to take  
Sacrifice to make  
Whatever it takes I won't turn away  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  
Give me one reason to live without Him  
Give me one reason to walk away  
I know you don't understand this feeling  
How can I show  
That He is the reason I have to let you go  

You walk a narrow road  
I know you face it on your own  
But you've got the will inside  
I can see it in your eyes  
You're not about mini skirts  
And silly reasons just to flirt  
Cause you've got heaven on your side  
And that's how you live your life  
  
Hang on, good girl, you're not the only one  
Be strong, good girl, when the pressure comes  
When they try to bring you down  
You'll be glad you stood your ground  
So just hang on  
  
You've seen a lot of things  
You're the keeper of many dreams  
You've got everything it takes  
To stay strong, carry on  
You're sick of childish games  
You speak the truth and you say it straight  
And when your dreams have been delayed  
You've got the strength to wait  
So keep on waiting  
  
You're not sugar and spice and everything nice  
You've got character and you paid the price  
You're not after self-perfection  
You're living out your redemption  
What sets you apart from everyone else  
Is that you know your savior and you know him well  
What makes you different from all the rest  
Is that you won't let it get to you

Here and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
Here and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
And now and now  
Here I am, you made it all so clear  
I understand, I am just a stranger here  
I leave it all behind  
All that's left is gone  
And I know about my mind  
Straight into your arms  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down, we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Give me all the depth of the sweetest dreams which follow that I see  
You are eternal, eternal life  
Where could I, where could I, where could I go  
But I got you in the light with everybody's side  
Lord its clear when I needed day and night  
So leave it all behind  
To all that's left is gone  
And we'll go with all our might  
Straight into your arms  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Lord I give my life  
No matter what it takes  
'Cause you gave it all for me  
With all of our hearts we sing  
With all of our joy we bring  
Everything we will bring  
Our everything, everything  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Here and now we will stand with one voice hand in hand  
We will never back down we will never give in  
Here and now we will sing with one voice and we bring  
Our life as an offering we bring you everything  
Here and now  
Here and now  
Here and now

I used to wanna live inside a fairytale  
I wanted to be perfect and complete  
But every time I tried to figure out my life  
I was always disappointed with the ending  
And everything's different now  
I am not the same anymore  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
You have shown me what beauty's about  
From the inside out  
Every day I find another reason why  
I'm grateful for the miracle you sent  
And even when it's hard I gotta thank you Lord  
For giving me the blessing of a breath  
The one thing I know that is true  
It's not about me anymore  
It's all about You  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
You have shown me what beauty's about  
From the inside out  
Fairytales come and go  
But everybody knows  
There's more to be told  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
Lately, it's so amazing what you're doing to me  
Re-arranging me from the inside out  
Only you can take away  
All my superficial ways  
You have shown me what beauty's about  
From the inside out  
From the inside out  
From the inside out  

This life we lead is never boring  
New things come with every morning  
Every day is a second chance  
The start of a divine romance  
Take a breath and jump right in  
Let it out  
Tell the world what you're about  
Let them hear your screams, your shouts (out loud!)  
Don't hold back, don't let down  
It's all or nothing now  
Something's changing deep inside me  
I'm letting go of all I'm hiding  
I'm in over my head  
But I'm not afraid  
To dive in deep and make some waves  
No type of inquisition  
Could ever make me change my position  
I've told you before  
Tell me to be quiet and I'll shout some more  

Fleeting breath, Frailest flesh  
I'm a casualty at best  
And so I sink into Your depth  
My only place of rest  
Where earth and wind, and sky and sea  
Could never match Your majesty  
From where I stand, I'm crying out  
Jesus, You are life to me  
The treachery of valleys deep  
Has only made me weak  
I clothe this flesh with holiness  
My only place of rest  
Where earth and wind, and sky and sea  
Will never match Your majesty  
From where I stand, I'm crying out  
Jesus, You are life to me  
And when I see Your face I'll know  
All the pain and tears will go  
To the bottom of the sea  
You'll forever be holy, holy  
Holy...[4x]  
Where earth and wind, and sky and sea  
Will never match Your majesty  
From where I stand, I'm crying out  
Jesus, You are life to me  
Holy...[8x]  
When all is fallen (You are life to me)  
When all is broken (You are life to me)  
When all is empty (You are life to me)  
Life to me, life to me  
Life to me...  
When I am fallen (You are life to me)  
When I am broken (You are life to me)  
When I am empty (You are life to me)  
Life to me, life to me  
Life to me...Life to me...  

I had an angel that sat on my shoulder,  
Seems like everybody's got one,  
I had the devil waiting on standby,  
For when I wanted to have some fun  
Thought that I was living forever,  
I thought that my smile would get me in,  
Never felt the wind that was coming,  
Never thought the party would end  
No, no, no, no...  
[Chorus]  
Little did I know  
That you were all I needed  
Little did I see  
Until you opened up my eyes  
Little did I know  
That one prayer could reach you  
Little did I know  
That you even cared  
I had my daddy wrapped 'round my finger  
I never made my momma cry  
Nothin but smiles on the outside  
But all the while living a lie  
If you ask me am I going to heaven,  
I said you know I've been a good good girl  
I'm gonna spend all my money on makeup  
And a find a boy who will buy me the world  
[chorus]  
little did I know  
That you loved me before I even met you  
I didn't see beyond myself  
But I couldn't fight forever  
Because you are so easy to trust  
And now we play together  
My life has just begun  
[chorus x2]  

There was a time when I'd believe in anything but you,  
I closed my eyes and let You in,  
Ready to let my life begin,  
It just hit me, couldn't ignore it,  
Heard your voice calling, now I know it!  
  
[Chorus]  
I wanna see Your face,  
I wanna speak Your name,  
I wanna tell the whole world how my life has changed,  
I'm gonna lift my voice,  
Ever to sing Your praise,  
As long as I'm alive know that I  
I'm living for You.  
  
Lord, here I stand before You now,  
I want to give You everything,  
No matter what may come my way,  
You give me a smile they can't take away.  
Holding onto all You brought me though,  
You're the strength that I'll always cling to!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Some may question what is right,  
In my heart I can't deny,  
Once I was blind but now I see,  
You have my soul and I am Your for eternity!  
  
Oh, Lord, I wanna see Your face,  
I always wanna sing Your praise,  
I wanna be the first to say,  
Forever I'm living for only You!  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Spotlight glaring down  
Silence from the crowd  
The circus is just beginning  
I tremble, looking around  
I would hate to fall and hit the ground  
In front of all these people  
That wouldn't be pleasant  
So the music plays  
And the trapeze sways  
And my heart is beating faster  
But all I hear is laughter  
From the crowd  
Cause they see right through my gaze  
Would you please tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just trying to understand  
Why you don't love me  
Why you don't love me for me  
There is someone who loves you for you  
I keep lying to myself  
Trying to be somebody else  
In front of all these people  
I feel really foolish  
And when the main attraction at the masquerade  
If I keep goin' like this, I'm gonna go insane  
Is this circus act all I'll ever be?  
Yeah...  
Would you please tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just playing a losing hand  
If you don't love me  
If you don't love me for me  
There is someone who loves you for you  
God loves you and me  
Let me tell you it's the kind of love that's given free  
And it doesn't fake  
And it doesn't flake  
And it doesn't play those games  
God loves me and you  
Let me tell you it's the kind of love  
It's real, it's true  
And it doesn't lie  
And it's doesn't cheat  
After it takes you off your feet  
So just... tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just trying to understand  
Why you don't love me  
Why you don't love me for me  
Tell me  
What I gotta be  
For you to want me  
For you to want me, yeah  
Cause I am  
Just playing a losing hand  
If you don't love me  
If you don't love me for me

God is someone who loves you for you  

I led a lonesome journey  
Full of disdain and fury  
I kept my angered yearning  
Close to me like fire burning  
I watched a million chances  
Slip through my weathered hands  
I almost lost myself when I looked around  
There was nobody else  
[Chorus:]  
In the nick of time  
You opened up my mind  
And suddenly I saw the world much clearer  
In the nick of time  
You turned my water to wine  
And suddenly I didn't feel the fear  
Right before my eyes  
You showed me there was life that to be found  
You're the miracle I prayed about you  
You were the one to save my life  
In the nick of time  
I followed habits around  
Been swept above off the clouds  
But fallen down left shaken  
Abandened by the pills I'd taken  
I could have kept on going  
With no one ever knowing  
Who really wants to see a tired nobody like me  
[Chorus (2x)]  
I could not, I could not believe  
That you were right there waiting  
I never, no, I never dreamed  
That you'd be right there waiting  
Oh you were there for me  
And when I couldn't see,  
I couldn't, no, I couldn't see  
You showed me life [2x]  
LIFE [3x]  
[Chorus (2x)]  

Feeling so crazy lately  
When it seems that You're not around  
The sun and the moon shine bright  
But my eyes are all Yours now  
Don't know how I lived with out You  
I don't remember how it used to feel  
Lord, I can't imagine if I had no You to hold me  
  
[Chorus]  
Where would I go with no You to run to  
No You to hold me when I am afraid?  
Who would I be with no You beside me?  
I ought to know it by now without You there's no me  
Oh, there's no me  
  
Lord, when I need You, You're always here  
To play through the laughter, love through the tears  
And when my heart seems so far away  
Into Your arms is where I wanna stay  
I try to find the words to tell You  
All the things my heart's been telling me  
I don't wanna know how it feels to have no You to love me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Where would I go with no You to run to?  
No You to hold me when I am afraid?  
Where would I be with no You beside me?  
I ought to know it by now without you  
  
[Chorus]

Sick of all the games  
This story's getting old  
It's time for a change  
I'm gonna take control  
  
I'm not an object or possession  
You played with the wrong girl  
And you don't own me anymore  
The game of love is overrated  
  
It's not real, I'm tired of playing  
You can try to pull me in with promises  
You don't intend to keep  
You can try to put the pressure on  
  
But baby, I'm not that naive  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
Till the walls fall all around me  
But you can never make me feel unloved  
  
'Cause you're not the one  
I am stronger than you know  
I'm smarter than you think  
Not made of stone  
  
But I stand on my own feet  
I'm not your mother or your keeper  
I'm not your average girl  
'Cause I know what I'm living for  
  
You can try to pull me in with promises  
You don't intend to keep  
You can try to put the pressure on  
But baby, I'm not that naive  
  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
'Til the sky falls all around me  
But you can never make me feel unloved  
'Cause you're not the one  
  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
'Til the sky falls all around me  
Now I know what I'm living for  
You can try to break me, try to hurt me  
  
'Til the sky falls all around me  
You're not the one, you're not the one

Everyday is the same old thing,  
Same frustration, same rutine.  
And by the time I realize I haven't taken time to spend with you  
My day is through.  
  
Have a little faith you say  
It'll go a long, long way  
Look up, I'm coming soon.  
Everything I think I need, it all begins to seem  
So small in the Presence of you.  
  
(CHORUS)  
One day,(one day)  
All these words will meet their music.  
One day,(one day)  
All these dreams will come true.  
One day,(one day)  
You'll trade answers for confusion.  
One day,(one day)  
Lord I will be with you one day.  
Ladada, ladada, ladada, one day  
Ladada, ladada, ladada, one day  
  
I look around and I'll I see  
Are selfish people, selfish me.  
Distracted by the things around  
These conversations weigh me down.  
  
Have a little faith you say  
It'll go a long, long way.  
Look up, I'm coming soon.  
Then I'm reminded of  
Everything that you have done  
And I'm caught in the presence of you.  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
When you open up the sky  
I will be free from this shell, and I will fly  
I will see you eye to eye  
  
One day... you will wipe away all the tears  
One day... and all the anger and fear  
One day... you'll hold me for a hundred years  
One day...  
  
(Chorus) (Ladada, ladada, ladada x3)  

Woke up this morning, went to the window, saw a rainy day.  
Feeling the pressure from all the things I gotta face today.  
All of my days, are totally crazy can't do nothing right.  
It's an ordinary day.  
Every minute feels like an hour slowly creeping by.  
All of this stress but I do my best to keep it all in stride.  
I need to decide.  
I need to unwind.  
All these things are on my mind  
It's an ordinary day.  
[chorus]  
Things are crazy but it's all right.  
You make me feel alright again.  
When it rains you are the sunshine.  
That lights me up from deep with in.  
I can finally treasure this love beyond a measure.  
You given me the pleasure of an ordinary day  
Pounding the pavement.  
Another engagement.  
Gotta make it there on time.  
Hitting the side walk  
Hearing the small talk of people passing by.  
Wondering why.  
Gotta rewind.  
Think I gotta clear my mind.  
It's an ordinary day.  
What are the chances I've locked glances with a passer by.  
Oh, a stranger must be an angel cause he smiled.  
I wonder if he knows anything I know that there is life  
In an ordinary day.  
[Chorus]  

He made you feel plain  
When he forgot your name  
Let me tell you something  
I have felt the same  
I know you're in pain  
But be another boy along the way  
And God he made you beautiful and  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
You are jewel you're a treasure  
You are one of a kind  
And you shine just as bright  
As the stars in the sky  
You're a rare kind of wonder  
Created just right  
So keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothing about you that's plain  
No no no  
You tell me, you're not the type  
The kind of girl that they like  
And your a little insecure about  
How you look in their eyes  
Well fashion will change  
And trends come and go everyday  
But God only made one of you and  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
'Cause you are a jewel you're a treasure  
You are one of a kind and  
You shine just as bright as  
The stars in the sky  
You're a rare kind of wonder  
Created just right  
So keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
See your mind, it is precious  
Though your heart may be restless  
And your eyes they will see  
All that you're meant to be  
'Cause your spirit is strong  
And your soul carries on  
You'll keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
You know I've had my days  
When I feel out of place, yeah  
I look at who I am, cover what I can  
I wish it all would change but  
Take the makeup away  
You see the same girl still remains  
She may not feel that beautiful  
But there's nothin' about her that's plain  
And you are jewel you're a treasure  
You are one of a kind  
And you shine just as bright  
As the stars in the sky  
You're a rare kind of wonder  
Created just right so keep  
Your head up no matter the pain  
Keep your head up no matter the pain, ooh yeah  
Keep your head up no matter the pain  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  
You may have felt plain but  
God, he knows your name  
Let me tell you something  
There's nothin' about you that's plain  

What is the meaning of life?  
I've asked myself so many times  
Is there a reason I'm here?  
I wish someone would make it clear  
'Cause I'm living from day to day, feeling so far away  
Maybe I'm not as sane as I thought  
Keeping my eyes on You is something I've gotta do  
Even when I don't feel like it  
  
I won't give up, I won't give in  
I'm ready for my life to start again  
I won't back down, I'll stand my ground  
The time is now to show the love I've found  
I've got a reason to breathe, I've got the freedom to stand  
The future is mine, I'll give it all I can  
To break down the walls that hold me in  
It's my reason to live  
  
My reason to wake up every day and bless Your name  
In the crush of this crazy messed up world  
Only You have stayed the same  
I know I have a place here in amazing grace  
Forever safe, forever sound  
Time after time I see You are the best in me  
You're everything I'm chasing after  
  
Listen as the walls fall down  
Hear the nations calling out

Here I am alone with You  
Quietly I talk to You  
You said the truth would set me free  
So here I am surrendering  
I know I can let Your promise be my hope  
And I know until You take me home  
I'm safe, safe 'cause You love me  
Safe, safe all because Your name  
Has power to calm the ocean  
When everything changes I'm safe  
My heart is overflowing  
With peace beyond all knowing  
This love is deep, it shelters me  
And I'm safe within Your reach  
I know I can let Your promise be my hope  
And I know until You take me home  
Though the odds are stacked against me  
Though I'm running out of time  
My heart is breaking  
But I know that You are mine  
So I let You see into me as You hold me in Your hand  
My heart is on my sleeve  
I'm safe because You understand  
You understand  
  

Does anybody care what's going on  
Sometimes I'm numb  
Sometimes I'm over come.  
Does anybody see what's going on  
Do I have to wear my scars like a badge on my arm  
For you to see me  
I need relief  
  
Do I have to scream for you to hear me  
Do I have to bleed for you to see me  
Cause I grieve  
Your not listening to me  
Do I need to scream  
  
Has anybody seen what's been done  
Where were my defense  
No one heard my protest  
The eyes of God were watching me  
It's time to make my peace,  
Let is go and be released  
So I can breathe again (breathe again)  
I'm on my knees  
  
Do I have to scream for you to hear me  
Do I have to bleed for you to see me  
Cause I grieve  
Your not listening to me  
Do I need to scream (Repeat)  
  
I don't have to scream for you to hear me  
I don't have to bleed for you to see me  
Cause I'm clean  
And your listening to me  
I don't have to scream

Sometimes I feel lost in a sea of insecurity  
That rages inside of me, so terribly caught  
And the waves of self-rejection  
Make me question my ability  
But there's a fire that always burns  
And there's a voice inside  
And all it wants is to be heard  
?Cause beyond skin deep  
There's so much more to see  
My hopes, my dreams designed with destiny  
I was fashioned with passion  
A burning desire to know  
The One who made me more  
He made me more than skin deep  
?Cause I am more, I am more than skin deep  
So much more  
It's so hard to change  
When we are captive to ourselves  
Always thirsty for something else  
But free or enslaved  
We are sons, we are daughters  
Called out by the Father's name  
So take the fire and let it burn  
Unleash the voice inside  
?Cause everyone needs to be heard  
Beyond skin deep  
There's so much more to see  
Our hopes, our dreams designed with destiny  
We were fashioned with passion  
A burning desire to know  
The One who made us more  
He made us more than skin deep  
?Cause we are more, we are more than skin deep  
So much more  
We are more than the future  
We are more than the past  
We were made to bring glory  
Given souls that will last  
We are more than our bodies  
We are more than the grave  
We were bought by His blood  
And from ourselves we've been saved  

You have never changed your ways  
You think that you can own me like a slave  
And I want to walk away  
But every time I try you're in my face  
You say, I could have it all  
Trust you, you will never let me fall  
And my heart feels bound to your control  
But my spirit says, no, no, no  
  
[Chorus]  
Stop right there  
Suddenly temptation's flying  
Everywhere  
And you think you've got me down  
Well think again, I'm not your friend  
It's plain to see, I'm not your property  
Stop right there  
Suddenly temptation's flying  
Everywhere  
And you think you've got me down  
Well think again, I'm not your friend  
Don't play with me, I'm not your property  
  
Ring! It's you once again  
Begging me to listen to your plan  
But you see I've found the truth  
Cause I have been redeemed and so we're through  
You say, I could have it all  
Trust you, you will never let me fall  
I don't have to give into your demands  
The power's not in your hands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I don't have to do anything you want me to  
I don't need you to make me feel like I want more  
Cause God has shown His love is your weakness  
He is above and beyond all you can do  
  
[Chorus: x2]

They called you a failure  
They called you a lost cause  
They said you would never become anything at all  
A generation  
With no direction  
But when I look in your eyes I see the prize yet to be claimed  
I'll say it once, I'll say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you, paid for me and I believe in you and I know you'll find the truth  
I know you've been broken  
'cause I've seen the abuse  
I know there's a place inside your heart begging for truth  
For a softspoken answer  
That won't break your spirit  
But when I look in your eyes I see the prize that's yet to be claimed  
I'll say it once, I'll say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you, paid for me and I believe in you and I know you'll find the truth  
but that's not what they told you when they said that they gave up on you and
you're nothing and you'll never be anything  
I'll wait for the day when you'll stand up and say I can do all things through
him who strengthens me  
I'll say it once, I'll say it twice that your life was worth the price paid
for you, paid for me and I believe in you. yes I believe in you and I know
you'll find the truth.  
  

I tried to find You but I didn't know Your name  
I searched for love, but I found only pain  
I chased the truth, but I only caught the lies  
When I searched for beauty  
  
Dirt got in my eyes  
And then Your love showed up  
And it erased my pain  
Lord, You gave it all just to clear my name  
  
Why You love me I cannot understand  
How You love me, can't even comprehend  
That You want me as broken as I am  
I can never repay  
  
The way You love me  
The closer that I get to You the smaller this world seems  
Deep inside my heart You placed eternity  
You gave me room to breathe, a place to get away  
  
Standing in Your presence with a debt I can't repay  
There's no high, there's no low  
There's no power or control  
Nothing's gonna keep me from You  
  
I love the way, the way You love me

1 2 3  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
Fallen to pieces  
(I am undone)  
The things you said  
(Manipulation)  
I trusted you like a fool  
While you made all the rules  
So you searched me out  
And you took me down  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
The things you found  
(To use against me)  
Have lost their sound  
(When mercy and truth meet)  
I fell to the Father's feet  
His words washed all over me  
And all the scars you made  
Watch them fade away  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet  
Embraced the victory, and some defeat  
I've tasted bitter, tasted sweet  
I found the beauty in the place they meet  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, what would that be?  
If words that were spoken, had not shattered me  
If I was unbroken, I'd never know  
The beauty of hope, and how far grace will go  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  
To be unbroken, to be unbroken  

You said You'd never leave  
You said You'd never forsake me  
Time after time I see every little thing You do  
And all You say turns out to be for real  
And all Your promises come true  
Now I have all the things I need to live for You  
A faith that's unshakable  
A heart that's unbreakable  
Your truth that has set me free  
A love that's unchangeable  
A life that's available if I would've just believed  
That's what You gave to me  
With every passing day  
You prove You've stayed the same  
It's taken some time to see  
That I am the one who's changed  
Now I will never be the same  
Since You've made me see  
You shower me with  
Every good thing that I can be  
From the moment that I first believed  
I was free and now  
You have given to me every good thing  

Everybody's searching for something  
Something that they can call their own  
Wishing, hoping, waiting for empty skieds to open up  
But they don't  
What's up with all the obsession  
What's in and what's out  
That's what it's about  
Still we dream of better  
Fearing nothing's gonna ever be right, yeah  
All along, don't you know that you can't break free  
Take a look and see what's your reality  
[Chorus:]  
Upside down, spining round and round  
Happiness may not be what it seems  
Inside out, alone whithout a doubt  
Is your heart until he sats you free  
From all of this reality  
Oh, you know the world is so crazy  
It'll chew you up, spit you out  
Leave you feeling empty inside  
Filling your head with little white lies  
Jesus is the only reason that my heart is free to say  
You could dream a thousand dreams and have a million things  
But nothing could replace the love that jesus gave  
Talk shows, ecstasy, horoscopes, dvd's, pop culture, magazines, chat rooms,
MTV  
Protein diets, internet, the story isn't over yet, the psychic network really
cares?  
WHO WANTS TO BE A MILLIONAIRE?!!!!  
[Chorus]  

You've been hurt  
You've been lied to  
You ran all your life  
Just to get out of your shoes  
But you settled in too soon  
Now your road is clear-ly  
Darkno room  
For any light to break through  
  
You're on a mission to get even with the world  
To give back all the pain you received  
It's just too hard to believe  
That anything can make it better  
  
Please don't let it end this way  
You could wait another day  
It's foolish games that players play  
One choice can bring you so much ache  
Please don't end up this way  
There's got to be some other way  
You could live without this mistake  
So please wait  
  
You've been betrayed  
Left so confused  
Couldn't understand  
How trust could be so abused  
So you let the darkness  
Come over you  
Now you don't know  
Anyone to turn to  
  
You're beat up and bitter  
Face down in the cold  
Lyin' in the ground with footprints on your back  
Where ya gonna go?  
You've never been so low  
  
Please don't let it end this way  
You could wait another day  
It's foolish games that players play  
One choice can bring you so much ache  
Please don't end up this way  
There's got to be some other way  
You could live without this mistake  
So please wait  
  
Please don't let it end this way  
You could wait another day  
It's foolish games that players play  
One choice can bring you so much ache  
Please don't end up this way  
There's got to be some other way  
You could live without this mistake  
So please wait

You know I can't explain this feeling  
It's almost like I'm dreaming this reality  
You know You give me such a freedom  
I finally found the way home  
I'm right where I belong  
Ever since the day I prayed  
You into my heart I placed  
Every bit of me into Your hands  
Lord, I'm here to stay  
  
With all of my heart  
I'm gonna love You  
With all of my soul  
I'll put all my trust in You  
With all of my strength  
I'm standing beside You  
With all of my everything

Who am I to know You the way I do?  
From now until forever

From now til eternity

With all of my heart  
With all of my heart  
  
Every night when I close my eyes  
I am amazed at how You've blessed my life in every way  
I'm mystified by Your great love  
Nothing compares to having You near  
Every day I'll love You more than the day before  
  
With all of my heart  
I'm gonna love You  
With all of my soul  
I'll put all my trust in You  
With all of my strength

pain and problem free  
but over time i found reality  
and through it all i see
