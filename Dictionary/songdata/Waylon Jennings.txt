I don't look the way the average cowboy singer looks  
I'll admit I've taken things I never should of took  
You can read a different story in a lot of different books  
But even then you won't really know  
How it was a long time ago  
  
Women have been my trouble since I found out they weren't men  
In spite of that I stopped and took a wife now and then  
They built their fences high but they couldn't hold me in  
I was born with a fire down below  
And I learned to fly a long time ago  
  
Don't ask me about the years I spent out in the rain  
About the ones I spent in love or the ones I spent insane  
Don't ask me who I gave my seat to on that plane  
I think you already know  
I told you that a long time ago  
  
Me and ol' Willie, lordy we've been sold and bought  
I guess you all heard about some kind of system that we fought  
We ain't the only outlaws just the only ones they caught  
They tried to run us off but Willie's slow  
I quit running a long time ago

Down the road a ways I have heard say a new day's comin' on  
Where the woman folks are friendly and the law leaves you alone.  
Well I'll believe it when I see it but I haven't seen it yet.  
Don't mind me just keep on talkin' I am just looking for my hat.  
  
Ain't no God in Mexico  
Ain't no way to understand  
How that border crossing feeling makes a fool out of a man.  
If I had not seen the sunshine Hell I would not cuss your rain  
My feet would fit a railroad track  
I would made one Hell of a train.  
  
Me and Louise Higginbotham use to race across the yard  
Back in 1947 that's when more than times were hard  
Well pity me I didn't see the line in time and like a fool  
In front of God and everybody I politely blew my cool  
  
Ain't no God in Mexico ain't no comfort in the can  
When your down in Matamoras gettin' busted by the man  
If I had not seen the sunshine I would not cuss your rain.  
If my feet would fit a railroad track I guess I would have been a train

Just a broken down cowboy all down on his luck been through the best of his
friends  
On a long lonesome highway in an old pickup truck  
Crossed Texas like a hot dusty wind  
He was all around cowboy back in1949 from the top it's been long way down  
Since the whiskey and the women started winnin' his time  
They rode him high and hard to the ground  
He remembers the thrill of bein' a winner in the days of his first rodeo  
But there's somethin' about winning that didn't last forever  
Maybe tomorrow things'll get better if devil lets loose of his soul  
He'll be be the all around cowboy again  
[ ac.guitar ]  
So he rolls up a smoke and he sips his Old Crow  
Whipes the whiskers that cover his chin  
And he grins as he dreams of old rodeo he's the all around cowboy again  
He remembers the thrill...  
  
  

Isn't there anyone  
Who'll take me like I am?  
Someone who's willing  
To take the blue in man  
Someone that's pleased enough  
With himself to let me be  
Someone who'd love me  
And try to understand my needs  
No, I guess there isn't  
And there's no place  
I can go I guess  
I'm destined to be alone  
Good thing that somewhere  
In this world there'll be  
Someone who wouldn't  
Always try to change me  
Someone not trying to prove  
Their way is right  
Take a flame that's burnin?  
And just put out the light  
No, I guess there isn't  
And there's no place  
I can go I guess  
I'm destined to be alone  

Anita, come closer  
Stop crying and listen to me  
I guess it's too late now  
But somehow I must make you see.  
What we thought was our world  
Was only a dream world  
And we just can't go on like this  
Anita, you're dreaming  
Of a world that can never exist.  
  
Anita, it's over  
There's nothing that's left now to say  
Anita, you're dreaming  
And I know it's better this way.  
  
Anita, come closer  
And close your pretty blue eyes  
Your young dreams just can't be  
And somehow you must realize.  
And each time you're with me  
My conscience reminds me  
Of someone who's waiting alone  
Anita, you're dreaming  
And when you awake, I'll be gone.  
  
Anita it's over  
There's nothing that's left now to say  
Anita, you're dreaming  
And I know it's better this way

I've had to burn most every bridge I've crossed  
It seems like everything I've loved I'd lost  
When I met you I've thought my luck had turned  
But our love's just another bridge to burn.  
  
So, I'll soon light the fire and move on  
Oh, I've already been here much too long  
I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned  
But our love's just another bridge to burn.  
  
Sometimes one must love enough for two  
And that's the way it's been with me and you  
I'll see your face no matter where I'll turn  
But that will be another bridge to burn.  
  
So, I'll soon light the fire and move on  
Oh, I've already been here much too long  
I'm so hurt and you're so unconcerned  
But our love's just another bridge to burn.  
  
Our love's just another bridge to burn

Slippin' and a-slidin', playin' Dominoes  
Leftin' and a-rightin' ain't a crime, you know  
Well, I gotta tell the story before it's time to go  
Well, are you ready for the country?  
Are you ready for me?  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ain't that the sight to see?  
Talkin' to a preacher, said God was on his side  
Talkin' to a butcher, they both were sellin' hide  
Well, I gotta tell the story, boys  
I don't know the reason why  
Are you ready for the country?  
Are you ready for me?  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ain't that a sight to see?  
[Incomprehensible]  
Are you ready for the country?  
Are you ready for me?  
Better get ready for the country  
Ready for me  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ready for me?  
Are you ready for the country?  
Ain't that the sight to see?  

Winding your way down on Baker Street  
Lite in your head and dead on your feet  
Well, another crazy day you drink the night away  
And forget about everything.  
  
These city streets make you feel so cold  
It's got so many people but it's got no soul  
And it's taken you so long to find out you were wrong  
When you thought it held everything.  
  
Used to think that it was so easy  
Used to say that it was so easy  
You're tryin', you're tryin' now  
Another year and then you'd be happy  
One more year and then you'd be happy  
You're cryin', you're cryin' now.  
  
Way down the street there's a light in his place  
You open the door he's got that look on his face  
And he asks you where you've been  
You tell him who you've seen  
And you talk about anything.  
  
He's got this dream about buyin' some land  
He's gonna give up the booze and the one night stands  
Then he'll settle down, it's a quiet little town  
And forget about everything.  
  
But you know he'll always keep moving  
Know he's never gonna stop moving  
'Cause he's rollin', he's the rolling stone  
And when you wake up it's a new morning  
The sun is shining it's a new morning  
You're goin' you're goin' home

A vagabond dreamer, a rhymer and singer of songs  
Singing to no one and nowhere to really belong  
I met a beautiful lady, a pure Southern belle of the ball  
Like Scarlet O'Hara loved no one and wanted them all  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll never forget you and love you inspite of your faults  
The good and the bad I want to remember it all  
I did a new dance and you did your Tennessee Waltz  
The party's all over I came uninvited  
I'm leaving and taking the belle of the ball  
  
There will always be someone I guess that's the way it should be  
I guess I should know that someone used to be me  
They'll gather around her soon they'll all look the same  
At the feet of the lady are lover's without any names  
  
[Chorus]

Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I ain't got a dime  
Sleepin' in the filty trainyard at the warmest driest place that I can find  
What have I done that would justify the way you treatin' me Big D  
Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I don't know a soul  
I could feel a little warmer but I find that there's no coat in my woredraw  
My clothes're paper thin still you let your chill of winter fall on me Big D  
[ guitar ]  
Why I wanna go where the winds don't blow till summer  
Somewhere the sun will warm this chill in me  
Stranded here in Dallas cold and hungry I don't even know my name  
Oh my temperature keeps risin' and I feel that it's done damage to my brain  
Could this dirty trainyard be the last and final restin' place for me Big D
Big D  
  
  

Billy we've come along way together and through it all  
You've been just like a brother to me  
And Billy we've had our share of ups and downs  
Froze our tails sleeping on the ground  
When the jobs were few and far between.  
  
We've been knocking around together so long  
Singing them same old songs  
Been out in the rain so long I swear we're shrinking  
Billy lately I have done some thinking.  
  
When I look back on our lives  
We've sure had ourself a time  
But you know it's been a wild world we traveled  
And it's startin' to unravel.  
  
We leave so many loose ends behind  
We've been bucked off and kicked so many times  
And the ground just keeps gettin' harder  
Billy you know well as I we ain't gettin' no younger.  
  
Billy another summer's come and gone  
Now with winter coming on  
I know we planned on heading south  
But Billy I thought about it several days  
And these words I'm about to say.  
  
They don't taste good in my mouth  
But there's someone who's waiting back home  
Lord, if she'll still have me  
Guess I'll be saying so long you go on without me.  
  
Ain't no easy way of saying goodbye  
So be sure and tell 'em all down in Texas I said hi

Here's a song I wrote on a plane between Dallas and Austin  
Goin' to El Paso  
Whoops  
Now this is what gave us the idea to come down here,  
This is a song about a guy that probably did as much for  
Our kind of music as anybody.  
  
Well the Honky Tonks in Texas were my natural second home  
The way you tip your hat to the ladies in the rose of San Antone  
  
I grew up on music that we call western swing  
It don't matter whose in Austin, Bob Wills is still the King  
  
Lord, I can still remember the way things were back then  
In spite of all the hard times I'd live it all again  
To hear the Texas Playboys and Tommy Duncan sing  
Makes me proud to be from Texas where Bob Wills is still the King  
  
You can hear the Grand Ol' Opry in Nashville Tennessee  
Its the home of country music on that we all agree  
But when you cross that ol' Red River hoss,  
That just don't mean a thing  
Once you're down in Texas, Bob Wills is still the King  
  
If you ain't never been there, then I guess you aint been told  
That you just can't live in Texas unless you got alot of soul  
Its the home of Willie Nelson, the home of western swing  
He'll be the first to tell you, Bob Wills is still the King.

Baby, go down to the drugstore, buy me a guitar string  
And be sure to wear your coat, girl, 'cause it might rain  
'Cause honey, you know that rain is bad for my guitar strings  
Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one that's warm and long  
'Cause you're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song  
Baby, I've tried your doctors, they just couldn't make me well  
The higher I tried to climb, the further I fell  
Guess it must have blew my mind sniffing the fumes of Hell  
Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one that's warm and long  
You're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song  
Baby, throw away my pillow just before you turn the light  
All you'll have next to you now will be the night  
I'll be somewhere wrong, you'll be somewhere right  
Put on your warm coat honey, it's gonna be cold tonight  
Put on the one that's warm and long  
You're just before hearin' my brand new goodbye song  

Flying cross the desert in a TWA  
Saw a women walking  
Cross the sand  
They been walking thirty miles  
In route to L.A. to get  
A brown eyed handsome man  
The destination was  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Milo Venus was a beautiful lass  
She had the world  
In the palm of her hand  
But she lost both her arms  
In a wrestling match to get  
A brown eyed handsome man  
She fought and won herself  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Way back in history  
Three thousand years  
Back ever since the world began  
Been a whole lot a good women  
Shedding tears for  
A brown eyede handsome man  
That's what the trouble was  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Beautiful daughter couldn't  
Make up her mind between  
A doctor and a lawyer man  
Mamma told her daughter  
Go out and find herself  
A brown eyed handsome man  
Just like your daddy is  
A brown eyed handsome man  
  
Arrested on charges  
Of unemployment  
He was sitting in the witness stand  
The judges wife called up  
The district attorney said you better  
Free that brown eyed man  
If you want your job you'd better  
Free that brown eyed man  
  
Way back in history  
Three thousand years  
Back when ever since the world began  
Got a whole lot a good woman  
Shedding tears for  
A brown eyed handsome man  
That's what the trouble was  
A brown eyed handsome man

My bills are all due and the baby needs shoes. but I'm busted  
Cotton is down to a quarter a pound. and I'm busted  
I got a cow that's gone dry and a hen that won't lay  
A big stack of bills gettin' bigger each day.  
The county will haul my belongings away, 'cause I'm busted  
  
I went to see my brother, gonna ask him for a loan, I was busted  
I hate to beg like a dog for a bone, but I'm busted  
My brother said there ain't one thing I can do  
Wife and the kids they're all down with the flu  
I was just thinking about calling on you, 'cause I'm busted.  
  
I ain't no thief but a man can go wrong, when he's busted  
The food that we canned last summer is gone, and I'm busted  
Well, the fields are all bare and the cotton won't grow  
Me and my family gotta pack up and go  
I'll make a living but where I don't know, I'm just busted.

Do you remember Cactus Texas  
Nothing but a wide place in the road  
Eighteen wheelers never go there  
Main Street's just too narrow for the load.  
  
A little town of honest people  
Some we haven't seen for quite awhile  
I was young and restless  
And we both were full of dreams and running wild.  
  
We left our old hometown and family  
Barely had a nickel to our name  
We were out to win the world  
Not once looking back or losing aim.  
  
We hit the big town and the big time  
Not a lot of effort in the deal  
But in the bargain we lost touch with one another  
And old feelings that were real.  
  
In a big house up on easy street  
Where too much never seems to be enough  
We're not the same two people far away  
From all the days when the times were rough.  
  
Including you and I  
Is separated by a wall  
It's not something we can talk about  
In fact we seldom even talk at all.  
  
I don't think we realize  
How or why we ever came this far  
Let's go back to Cactus Texas  
Maybe once we're there we'll find out where we are

Gonna catch a freight train as far as I can Lord,  
I don't care which way it goes  
Gonna climb a mountain, the highest mountain Lord  
Jump off ain't nobody gonna know.  
  
Can't you see, oh can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me  
Can't you see, can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me?  
  
Gonna buy a ticket go as far as I can Lord  
I ain't never coming back  
Take me a southbound all the way down Lord  
Till the train run out of track.  
  
Can't you see, oh can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me  
Can't you see, can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me?  
  
Can't you see, oh can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me  
Can't you see, can't you see  
What that woman's been doin' to me?

I've been quite the traveler ever since I hit the road  
And the Sullen county carnival has been my earn in gold  
I've been quite alone since I remember when  
I turned my ultimatums into chips and cashed them in.  
  
I used to run the Ferris wheel but that'd be hard to prove  
I can't stand to see a rolling wheel propped up so it can't move  
I used to run the carousel hell that's just round and round  
Never liked to see them ponies painted up and bolted down.  
  
The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving  
The only thing that saves me from it all is I'll be gone  
Just when I could trust in all the things that I believe in  
I had to pack it up and move along  
And I'll tell you the boys I'm not the only one.  
  
I was a straight man at the ring toss but that was just a jaunt  
I can't see throwing rings around things you don't really want  
I could run the roller coaster but that might break my heart  
So much hard travelin' just to wind up where you start.  
  
Now I just work the gateway and I'm pretty satisfied  
Little booth is red and blue and I just sit inside  
I just take your money and give tickets out in trade  
Think about my life and all the promises I made.  
  
The only thing that keeps me from staying here is leaving  
The only thing that saves me from it all is I'll be gone  
Just when I could trust in all the things that I believe in  
I had to pack it up and move along  
And I'll tell you the boys I'm not the only one.  
  
Who's running from the things they've left undone.

I got a gal in Cedartown Georgia I used to have to walk nearly three miles to
court her  
She never had much just a sharecropper's daughter  
But I married her and took her down to New Orleans  
Got a little house in the South French Quarter  
Got a job tookin' bales load them on steamboat  
I give the seven days pay next day unbroke  
When she ain't a sleepin' all day she's a primpin'  
  
Every evenin' when the sun goes down she starts a swarmin' on Orleans town  
Walkin' into work this mornin' at daybreak  
I caught her with the tall long dandy from canebreak  
As she walked right by me and she looked right through me  
  
I made up my mind what I'm a gonna do eased in the pawnshop and bought a 22  
I watched as the roomclerk gave them a room key  
A standin' right outside I could read Room 23  
Tonight I'll put her on a train for Georgia  
Gonna be a lotta kin folks squallin' and a grieving  
Cause that Cedartown gal ain't breathing

If I should get a look of leavin' in my eyes  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind  
If I ever seem too restless or dissatisfied  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind  
Don't let me separate your love from mine  
Don't let me leave you, I might get the urge some time  
If I do, you'll know what to do to keep me by your side  
Put your arms 'round me, baby, and change my mind  
If the gay life of the barrooms beckons me at night  
Put your arms 'round me, baby, and change my mind  
And if a new love ever tempts me that I should search to find  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind  
Put your arms 'round me, woman, and change my mind  

Their eyes were upon me as they sat they're drinking  
Their hands reach up for you with lust in their hearts  
As you dance away I know just what they're thinking  
As I watch them watch you it just tears me apart  
Dance while my heart breaks Christina  
Dance to the strings of your shame and my sorrow  
I'll take you home when it's over to dream all the dreams of a brighter
tomorrow  
[ trumpet ]  
Your eyes fall out at them and the crowd all goes wild  
To them you're just a woman to go with their wine  
I look at you and all I can see is a child  
Hating the world makes you old before your time  
Dance while my heart breaks Christina...  
Dance while my heart breaks Christina...  
  
  

Down by the river where the big boats go by  
Each day you could see them as evening was nigh  
They planned to be married at the first sign of spring  
And Jim would take Cindy to see New Orleans  
The town folks would smile as they sat there alone  
Jim talked of the day he'd make Cindy his own  
He saved his money to buy her a ring  
And take his sweet Cindy to see New Orleans  
  
One day a riverboat gambler chanced by  
And captured her heart with his sweet words and lies  
He told her come with me and you'll be a queen  
So they left together to see New Orleans  
Each day you can see Jim though years have gone by  
Down by the river where the big boats go by  
She wrote she'd return at the first sign of spring  
He's waiting for Cindy to see New Orleans

Clyde plays electric bass plays it with finesse and grace  
Set on the porch ain't got no shoes pickin' the bass and singin' the blues  
  
Misery loves company this old dog sings harmony  
Tambourine tied to his tail you can hear him moan you can hear him wail yeah  
  
Jodie baby she got the dollar down the road you can hear her holler  
Get up Clyde we got things to do that old dog's singin' the blues  
  
He don't move he don't flinch Clyde he don't move an inch  
Set on the porch ain't got no shoes pickin' the bass and singin' the blues  
  
Clyde played electric bass

If you're in a bind,with a troubled mind  
I'm a mountain,come on and climb  
Because you look so good,to be so down  
It won't take much girl,to turn it all around  
  
[Chorus]  
Come with me,come with me  
The feeling's free,just come with me  
Will get on a cloud girl,and ride it high  
Say hello sun,as we sail bye  
  
I'll take you where,you've never been before  
Once we're there,you'll cry for more  
If it's dark in your world,come walk in mine  
My love's a light babe,it's on all the time  
  
[Chorus: x 2]

I've got a couple more years on you, baby,that's all.  
I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.  
And it ain't that I'm wiser,  
It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall.  
And I've picked up a couple more years on you, baby.. that's all.  
  
I've walked a couple more roads than you, baby,that's all.  
And I'm tired of runnin' while you're only learning to crawl.  
And you're headin somewhere,  
But I've been to somewhere, and found it was nowhere at all.  
And I've picked up a couple of years on you baby, that's all.  
  
Now sayin' goodbye, girl don't never come easy at all.  
But you've got to fly 'cause you're hearin' those young eagles call.  
And someday when you're older, you'll smile at a man strong and tall.  
And you'll say I've got a couple more years on you, baby, that's all.  
  
I've got a couple more years on you baby, that's all.  
You'll say I've had more chances to fly and more places to fall.  
It ain't that I'm wiser,  
It's only that I've spent more time with my back to the wall.  
And I've picked up a couple more years on you baby, that's all.

Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And the storm's brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that it's real  
You're someone else's love now you're not mine  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
While my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
But for now I'm just lonesome all the time  
  
So take all the treasured dreams I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday these crazy arms may hold somebody new  
But for I'm just lonesome all the time  
Crazy arms that reach  
  
But for now I'm just lonesome all the time

His father was a Princeton lawyer  
A man of means  
His mother summa-cum-laude  
Former beauty queen  
With a house as big as a hotel  
On Spencer boulevard  
That's where he got his start  
  
Eighteen years of summer camp  
And private schools  
All american golden boy  
With a silver spoon  
His future held all the promise of a president  
Wonder where it went  
  
It's hard to be the crowned prince  
When it all hits home  
You can't hide behind the wall  
Around the throne  
  
The real world's not a playground  
It's a danger zone  
You find out who you really are  
When the pressures on  
He's the first one in his family to wind up second best  
He couldn't pass the test  
  
His share of the fortune  
Spent on saving face  
His family comes to visit  
On the holidays  
Sometimes it's so quite there  
He hears the flowers bloom  
He's got a private room  
  
It's hard to be the crowned prince  
When it all hits home  
You can't hide behind the wall  
Around the throne  
  
Insanity is a state of mind  
Where life begins  
Or where it ends  
It all depends

Deep in the west where the tall mountains grow I've gone home  
Where the heavens above turn red from the fire down below  
Are you listening to me when I'm talking to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
Divided we're through  
  
Silver friend at night yellow friend you come with the dawn  
Back in my heart I've been drying my eyes see me run  
So you hang on to me and I'll hang on to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
Divided we're through  
  
Refusing to talk I suppose that it's all for love's sake  
And learning to give that's important before you can take from me  
Are you listening to me when I'm talking to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
  
So you hang on to me and I'll hang on to you  
Said together we're one divided we're through  
Divided we're through

I live on a big blue ball  
I never do dream I would fall  
But even the day that I do  
I'll jump off and smile back at you  
  
We don't even know where we are  
But they say that we're circling a star  
Well, I'll take their word, I don't know  
But I'm dizzy so maybe that's so.  
  
I'm riding a big blue ball  
And never do dream I would fall  
But even the high may lay low  
So when I do fall I'll be glad to go.

Surely you know by now my heart is wild I don't want to be tied down it ain't
my style  
Don't you think I know better world is kind of other too dis-selfish  
Well I can't help it I'm destiny's child  
I couldn't began to tell you if I try admit so much to love before a little
while  
  
Tried to remember all of the good love I wish you understood love  
I ain't no good love I'm destiny's child destiny's child destiny's child  
  
I could be on my way now please don't cry  
Gotta be somewhere else I don't know why  
Keep thinkin' of all I'm losin' I know your lips're soothin'  
I gotta be movin' I'm destiny's child  
  
I must wish you well and say goodbye I wish you moons and stars and sunny
skies  
You gave me so much to believe in my life has a little more meanin'  
Still I'm leavin' I'm destiny's child destiny's child destiny's child

Hello, it's good to see you  
Just how long has it been  
I've often wondered what I'd say  
If we ever met again  
If I'd try just being clever  
Or pretend not to remember  
But it's funny how you've lingered  
On my mind  
  
[Chorus]  
Didn't we shine  
Didn't we shine  
Didn't we share and care  
And lay our hearts on the line  
Maybe it wasn't meant to last  
Till the end of time  
Oh, but while it did  
Didn't we shine  
  
I still have some blue days  
That I could do without  
And when I have my blue days  
You're all I think about  
But I've long ago forgiven you  
For what you did or didn't do  
Now all I can recall  
Are the happy times  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Was it my imagination  
Or didn't we shine

I've been away for so long fought a war that's come and gone  
Doesn't anybody know my name  
My sister upped and wed mom was sick and took to bed  
And my old dog Red's gone lame  
Please tell me if you can what time the trains roll in  
(Two ten six eighteen) ten forty four  
This old house is falling down there ain't no need in me for hanging round  
Doesn't anybody know my name  
The girl I left behind she's gone with this friend of mine  
I don't have to see a sign to know things ain't the same  
Please tell me if you can...  
You can't get far away on just a soldier's pay doesn't anybody know my name  
Used to be when I could see everybody wanted me  
Guess nobody cares to see a blind man catch a train  
Please tell me if you can...  
  
  

Donna on my mind when I get up in the morning,  
Donna on my mind the whole day through,  
Love can't come so quick and real without any warning  
Wonder if she's thinking of me too.  
  
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me  
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,  
Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,  
Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind.  
  
Once I thought that no one girl could ever hold me  
Even thought this thing called love was just fantasy,  
Now I won't be satisfied until she's mine,  
Till then I'll just have Donna on my mind.

I scandalized my brother  
While admitting that he sang some pretty songs  
I'd heard that he'd been scandalizing me  
And Lord, I knew that that was wrong.  
  
Now I'm looking at it over somethin' cool  
And feeling fool enough to see  
What I had called my brother on  
Now he had every right to call on me.  
  
Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy  
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune  
That picker there's in trouble boy  
Ain't nothin' but another side of you.  
  
If we ever get to heaven boys  
It ain't because we ain't done nothin' wrong  
We're in this gig together  
So let's settle down and steal each other's song.  
  
I found a wounded brother  
Drinkin' bitterly away the afternoon  
And soon enough he turned on me  
Like he'd done every face in that saloon.  
  
Well, we cussed him to the ground  
And said he couldn't even steal a decent song  
But soon as it was spoken  
We was sad enough to wish that we were wrong.  
  
Don't ever cuss that fiddle boy  
Unless you want that fiddle out of tune  
That picker there's in trouble boy  
Ain't nothin' but another side of you.  
  
I know that it sounds silly  
But I think that I just stole somebody's song  
She's a good timin' woman  
In love with a good two timin' man.  
And she loves him in spite of the way  
That she don't understand.  

The hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal don't love you  
She'll cause you sleepless nights and endless pain  
But if you don't like the rules don't play the game  
Every time that girl walks by your heart will ache your very soul will die  
But love one sided it's just yourself to blame  
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game  
  
You think by now I see the fool I've been given my heart a chance to win  
Well I do but I don't I will but I won't deep inside I know I'll do again  
The hardest thing you ever do is love yourself that gal don't love you  
With love one sided it's just yourself to blame  
And if you don't like the rules don't play the game  
If you don't like the rules don't play the game

Down, down, down came the world  
I went round, round, round in a whirl  
I built every dream around one girl  
Then down, down, down came the world  
She must have loved a little  
Just to keep me hanging on  
How could lips that kiss so sweet  
Lie and be so wrong?  
Our love was just a pattern  
Of the perfect boy and girl  
The only dream I own  
In this world  
Down, down, down came the world  
I went round, round, round in a whirl  
I built every dream around one girl  
Then down, down, down came the world  
I built every dream around one girl  
Then down, down, down came the world  
Down, down, down came the world  

Sweet dream baby,  
Sweet dream baby  
Sweet dream baby,  
How long must I dream.  
  
Dream baby, got me dreamin'  
Aweet dreams the whole day through.  
Dream baby got me dreamin'  
Sweet dreams in nighttime too.  
  
I love you and I'm dreamin' of you  
That won't do  
Dream baby, help me stop my dreamin' of you  
And make my dreams come true.  
  
Sweet dream baby  
Sweet dream baby  
Sweet dream baby,  
How long must I dream

Everybody's looking for someway in  
I'm looking for someway out  
I've been wasting my time, standing in line  
If this is what it's all about  
  
All I've got is a job that I don't like  
And a woman that don't understand  
So tonight in the bar, I'll get in my car  
And take off for the promise land  
  
[Chorus]  
Drinkin' and dreamin', knowing damn well I can't go  
I'll never see Texas, L.A., or ol' Mexico  
But here at this table, I'm able to leave it behind  
Drink till I'm dreaming a thousand miles out of my mind  
  
This suit and this tie is just a disguise  
This ain't really me  
Some people were born to be tied down  
Some people were born to be free  
  
When I look down the road she don't know  
How it gets under my skin  
She's got my body but my heart and soul  
Are out there riding the wind  
  
[Chorus: x2]

You bring me happiness then leave me loneliness  
My world is in distress yet I keep falling for you  
You look into my eyes and tell the sweetest lies  
You're a heartbreak in disguise yet I keep falling for you  
  
Oh darling when you're near my world is happy dear  
But when you disappear I don't know what to do  
I love in misery you're so unfair to me it's such a mystery why I keep falling
for you  
  
Oh darling when you're near...  
It's such a mystery why I keep falling for you

I hear the train a comin' rollin' round the bend  
I ain't seen the sunshine since I don't know when  
Well I'm stuck in Folsom Prison and time keeps dragging on  
While a train keeps a rollin' on down to San Antone  
Well when I was just a baby my mama told me son  
Always be a good boy don't ever play with guns  
Well I shot a man in Reno just to watch him die  
When I hear that whistle blowin' I hang my head and I cry  
  
Well I'll bet there's rich folks eatin' in some fancy dining car  
Probably drinkin' coffee and smokin' big cigars  
Well I know I had it comin' I know I can't be free  
But those people keep a movin' that's what tortures me  
  
Well if they freed me from this prison if that railroad train was mine  
Bet I'd move it on a little farther down the line  
Far from Folsom Prison that's where I long to stay  
Then I'd let that lonesome whistle blow my blues away

That's what you get for lovin' me that's what you get for lovin' me  
Everything we had is gone if you can see that's what you get for lovin' me  
Don't you shed a tear for me I ain't the love you thought I'd be  
I've had a hundred just like you but don't be blue  
I'll have a thousand before I'm through  
That's what you get for lovin' me...  
[ guitar ]  
There you go you're cryin' again you should have known how things would end  
But someday when your poor heart is on the mend I just might pass this way
again  
That's what you get for lovin' me...  
That's what you get for lovin' me  
  
  

I tied my bandana,took my pack from the floor  
You were still sleeping,as I stood at the door  
Once more I was heading to,God only knows where  
That's when it hit me,I was already there  
Chorus:  
I could ramble,a thousand miles or more  
Never find the light I've seen in your eyes before  
You gave me the freedom to go on my own way  
But you gave me much more,you gave me the freedom to stay  
Why keep on running,just to wish on a star  
Searching for Heaven,when I know where you are  
Life is just empty,when you're walking alone  
So wherever we're going girl,Lord it's good to be at home  
Chorus  
  

I could tell you a story from another day in time  
How a high falootin' woman tried to make me walk the line  
She was into changin' too damn hard to please  
And the last time I saw her she was down on her knees.  
  
Born under the sign of the Gemini twins  
There's two sides to me and they ain't even friends  
All sides are rising and there ain't no in between  
When I'm bad I'm bad when I'm good I'm the best you ever seen.  
  
Sometimes I'm out a prowlin' and carryin' on  
Too high to know when it's time to take it home  
When I'm like that it's hard to leave the women alone  
It ain't easy thinkin' right with a good looking wrong.  
  
For another sign of the Gemini twins  
This two sides to me and me ain't even friends  
All sides are rising in the rainbow in between  
When I'm good I'm good when I'm bad I'm the worst you ever seen.  
  
There's a good hearted woman waitin' when I come in  
She don't wasting time and asking me about where I've been  
She keeps it all together and to wish that you could see  
Know she goes about bring it out the best side of me.  
  
Born under the sign of the Gemini twins  
There's two sides to me and they ain't even friends  
All signs are rising, and there ain't no in between  
When I'm bad I'm bad when I'm good I'm the best you ever seen

It's knowing that your door is always open  
And your path is free to walk  
That makes me tend to leave my sleeping bag  
Rolled up and stashed behind your couch  
And it's knowing I'm not shacked  
By forgotten words and boons  
And the ink stains  
That have dried upon some line  
That keeps you in the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
Keeps you ever gentle on my mind  
It's not clinging to the rocks and I'd be planted  
On their columns now that binds me  
Or something that somebody said  
Because they thought we fit together walkin'  
It's just knowing that the world will not be cursin' or forgivin'  
When I walk along some railroad track and find  
That you're movin' on the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
And for hours you're just gentle on my mind  
Though the wheat fields and the clothes lines  
And the junk yards and the highways come between us  
And some other woman 's cryin' to her mother  
'Cause she turned and I was gone  
I still might run in silence tears of joy, might stain my face  
And the summer sun might burn me till I'm blind  
But not to where I cannot see you  
Walking on the back roads  
By the rivers flowing gentle on my mind  
I dipped my cup of soap back from a gurglin'  
Cracklin' caltron in some train yard  
My beard a roughen coal pile  
And a dirty hat pulled low across my face  
Through cupped hands round a tin  
Can I pretend to hold you to my breast and find  
That you're waving from the back roads  
By the rivers of my memory  
Ever you're just gentle on my mind  

I bring it up  
You're quick to cover it all up again  
Thought we were friends  
What are friends for?  
The old bones in your closet  
Must really embarrass you  
And so to save face  
It's a locked place  
  
[Chorus]  
I don't see why you don't get naked with me  
Get all the little secrets out in the open air  
'Cause we won't ever be  
All that we could be  
  
As long as you won't get naked with me  
The future's gettin' shaky  
From all this holdin' back  
  
There's something in your past  
That seems to haunt you  
For better or for worse, I said  
  
I meant it through and through  
No one has ever loved you  
More than I do  
  
[Chorus]

Well he smoked those Camel cigarettes about three packs a day  
Nicotine stains on his fingers when he'd stretch them out to play  
That old "Midnight special" is one he loved to do  
Then he'd sing "I'm walking the floor over you  
  
TV preachers and welfare checks for him just had no place  
But he'd take his time to tune real good when he sang  
"Amazing Grace" He'd say boys I'm old and crazy but I still give a damn  
And I still think the boys got screwed over in Vietnam  
  
He'd drag out that old uniform  
And say "they used to call me slim"  
He never could get it buttoned up  
But the pride looked good on him  
He still feels the way he felt  
Over forty years ago  
Here's to the old man  
Here's to G.I. Joe  
  
He only sang the old songs, he's standing still in time  
"My Phillipino baby", right there on his mind  
Then he'd talk about the big one, the war we didn't lose  
He'd pick a little bit like Travis "Re-Enlistment blues"  
  
Here's to my old man  
And all the G.I. Joe's

I've thought I'd take a trip to Denver and spend a little time  
I thought maybe out in Denver I might get you off my mind  
No want no want go with me, just want to be alone  
I might find someone in Denver that can help me carry on  
Gone to Denver, gone to Denver, gone to mend a broken heart  
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin' I'd better be gone, gone to Denver  
Well, I've known a quiet wild, now I've been losing you  
And I'd rather might stay here and find out who I lost into  
Maybe I won't even miss you like I always thought I would  
I've heard Denver's quite a city and it changed my do me good  
Gone to Denver, gone to Denver, gone to mend a broken heart  
Now I was goin' and if I'm goin' I'd better be gone, gone to Denver  
Gone to Denver  

Everybody's gone away said they're moving to LA  
There's not a soul I know around everybody's leaving town  
Some caught a freight some caught a plane  
Find the sunshine leave the rain they say this town'll waste your mind  
Must be right cause it's wasting mine  
Some got to win some got to lose good time Charlies got the blues  
  
My heart keeps telling me there ain't no kid at thirty-three  
Play around you lose your wife you play too long you lose your life  
I got my pills to ease the pain can't find a thing to ease the rain  
Sometimes I'd like to try and settle down but everybody's leaving town  
Some got to win some got to lose good time Charlies got the blues

There are songs that birds don't sing to people  
There are secrets that keep right through to the end  
There are heroes who hide until forever  
And I'm singing this song for one of them  
  
He's the man that you passed on the road there  
The one with his life on the loose  
Going either somewhere or nowhere  
Going without me, without you  
  
For he is this world's constant orphan  
Traveling out his lone time  
Living on apples from orchards  
Dying from grapes on the vine  
  
You can find him in big city winters  
Down where the mission bell cries  
And sorrow echoes through summer  
As he tries to close all his eyes  
  
You can find him in Pittsburgh in Christmas  
You can find him in Buffalo in June  
And he knows all the back roads between them  
Like the gypsy knows the moon  
  
And it's route 22 all over again  
Stick your thumb out and try to look like somebody's friend  
Look strong at the man, gentle at the girl  
And puzzled at the rest of the world  
  
Living on apples from orchards  
Dying from grapes on the vine

Green River I've come back to you do you remember me  
Do you remember Molly with the soft blue eyes  
I left here with a lot of dreams none of them came true  
What I wanted was here waiting all the time  
Green River did she come here every evening  
Like the neighbors say she did so faithfully  
Green River has she's gone away forever  
She just disappeared one day as she gave upon me  
Green River if you see her won't you tell her I'll return  
All I've brought her is myself and this little dream  
Please tell her that I love her and my lesson I have learned  
Green River tell her please come back to me

That cold north wind is blowing grey eyes you know  
The years are quickly going grey eyes you know  
And the good life I promised you so long ago  
Is dead but for a dreaming grey eyes you know  
We never had much money grey eyes you know  
More rainy days than sunny grey eyes you know  
And life has been a long hard road to hoe  
But you stuck right by me smiling grey eyes you know  
Hard times took the blue from your eyes  
Leaving them grey as the winter's skies  
We've had our talk now I must walk away  
Leave you here beneath this mound of clay  
And I feel so empty as I turn to go  
For my heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know  
My heart lies there beside you grey eyes you know

Well I grew up lean and hungry I worked hard for my money  
Said I'm gonna live my life the way I please  
Spent some time on the road of life saw an angel once and the devil twice  
I came across some things that I don't need  
  
Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water  
And only one way out of a motel room  
Payments on the Cadillac and too many questions  
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune  
  
You know there's good and bad breaks you learn from your mistakes  
It's all in how you handle them do's and don'ts  
A hillbilly boy is hard to convince wild and stubborn and not much sense  
But I've got enough to know what I don't want  
  
Like a cold hearted women whiskey in my water...  
And old guitars that just won't stay in tune

It's true you have me twisted round your finger and it seems that's where I
belong  
You know how to hold me to thrill me and control me  
Just enough to keep me hangin' on  
For now tomorrow and forever I guess I'm tied to you right or wrong  
My love keeps a growing cause your love keeps a showing  
  
Just enough to keep me hangin' on  
A love that's strong as mine will make me do most anything  
Like hiding tears and heartaches and dreaming silly dreams  
You've got me where you want me you keep stringing me along  
Just enough to keep me hangin' on just enough to keep me hangin' on

He went to Paris looking for answers to questions  
That bothered him so  
He was impressive, young and aggressive  
Saving the world on his own  
Warm summer breezes, French wine and cheeses  
Put his ambition at bay  
The summers and winters scattered like splinters  
And four or five years slipped away  
  
He went to England, played the piano, and married  
An actress named Kim  
They had a good life, she was a good wife  
And bore him a young son named Jim  
All of the answers and all of the questions  
He locked in his attic one day  
Cause he liked the quiet clean country livin'  
And twenty more years slipped away  
  
War took his baby,  
Bombs killed his lady and left him  
With only one eye  
His body was battered, his whole world was shattered  
All he could do was just cry  
While the tears were falling he was recalling  
Answers that he never found  
So he hopped in a freighter, skidded the ocean  
And left England without a sound  
  
Now he lives in the islands, fishes the piling and drinks  
His Green label each day  
Writing his memoirs, losing his hearing  
But he don't care what most people say  
After eighty-six years of perpetual motion  
If he likes you he'll smile and say  
"Jimmy, some of it's magic, probably tragic,  
But I had a good life all the way"  
He went to Paris looking for answers to questions  
That bothered him so

I called you on the phone to say I love you that I stop by for you at nine  
My heart broke when you said that it's all over  
Someone else would take up all your time  
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime  
I'll never know what made you change your mind  
I only know I've held you close and kissed you my last time  
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime  
  
I went downtown to join the marry makers I told myself that here's where I
belong  
I thought that I was doin' fine without you and then I heard somebody play our
song  
And that's a lot of heartaches for a dime...  
That's a lot of heartaches for a dime

Well sometimes it's heaven  
And sometimes it's hell  
Sometimes I don't even know  
Sometimes I take it as far as I can  
And sometimes I don't even go  
My front tracks're found for a cold water  
And my back tracks're covered with snow  
Sometimes it's heaven  
Sometimes it's hell  
Sometimes I don't even know  
  
Heaven ain't walkin'  
On a street paved with gold  
And hell ain't a mountain of fire  
Heaven is layin'  
In my sweet baby's arms  
Hell is when baby ain't there  
Well my front tracks're found for a cold water  
And my back tracks're covered with snow  
Well sometimes it's heaven  
And sometimes it's hell  
Sometimes I don't even know

I'm gonna change my ways of doing things around here  
I'm turning over a new leaf gonna get myself in gear  
'Cause I've got a woman who's better than most  
And I've made a mess of her plans  
  
So startin' today all I'm gonna be is her man  
I've been a wild catter and a go go getter  
Been an SOB right down to the letter  
I've had misadventures I even got pictures  
  
Of even more than I can stand  
So startin' today all I want a be is her man  
I'm gonna give it all back cause all I've done is take  
I've put her on the back burner while I was out on the make  
  
But I've got a woman who's good enough to give me  
A second chance again  
So starting today all I'm gonna be is her man  
I've been a wild catter and a go go getter...  
  
I'm a little bit late but I'm wise enough  
I'm taking her by the hand  
Startin' today all I want a be is her man

Son you make me feel so proud I pop the buttons off my shirt  
I know I said I'd take you to the lake today  
But I'm going to have to break those plans, and it really hurts  
Every time I go fishin' it'd always start me wishin'  
That I could be a child again  
Take my 50 cents and go down to the local picture show  
To watch my heroes rope and ride  
Most times they'd win but when they'd lose it always made me cry  
Ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die  
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all  
  
Well I guess the fish just ain't bitin' just as well I don't feel like
fightin'  
All in all it just ain't that great a fishin' day that old newspaper headline  
Kind of wrapped around this old heart of mine another big one got away  
And I can't count the times he's made me laugh  
But this time he's made me cry  
There ain't nothing quite as sad as watching your heroes die  
One by one as they fall soon there'll be no heroes at all

Well I don't know who or where I am  
I don't know who do give a damn  
It's a hell of a mess that I've got me in  
Hittin' the bottle again  
I can't walk so I can't go home  
No need to talk cause I'm alone  
If I stay here they're gonna lock me in  
Hittin' the bottle again  
Hittin' the bottle again ever than I've drunker been  
Or is it drunker than I've ever been hittin' the bottle again  
  
[ guitar ]  
  
Well I tried to quit for a wife of mine  
I tried to quit but I changed my mind  
Every once in awhile and a now and a then  
Hittin' the bottle again  
Hittin' the bottle again...

Well I left my home down on a rural route  
And I told my folks I'm goin' steppin' out  
To get the honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues  
In and out of every joint in this town  
The city life has really got me down  
I got the honky tonk blues the honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues  
[ guitar ]  
I'm gonna slap my boogie underneath my arm  
Scud right back in my pappy's farm  
And lose these honky tonk blues the jumpin' honky tonk blues  
Well Lord I got 'em I got the honky tonk blues  
[ steel ]  
Well I left my home down on a rural route...

Low down leaving sun  
Done, did everything that needs done  
Woe is me, why can't I see?  
I'd best be leaving well enough alone  
  
Them neon light nights, couldn't stay out of fights  
Keep a-haunting me in memories  
Well is one in every crowd for crying out loud  
Why was it always turning out to be me?  
  
Where does it go? The good Lord only knows  
Seems like it was just the other day  
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables  
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay  
  
Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes  
There weren't another other way to be  
For lovable losers, no account boozers  
And honky tonk heroes like me  
  
Where does it go? The good Lord only knows  
Seems like it was just the other day  
I was down at Green Gables, hawking them tables  
Generally blowing all my hard earned pay  
  
Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes  
There weren't another other way to be  
For lovable losers and no account boozers  
And honky tonk heroes like me  
  
Where does it go? The good Lord only knows  
And seems like it was just the other day  
I was down at Green Gables and hawking them tables  
And generally blowing all my hard earned pay  
  
Piano rolled blues, danced holes in my shoes  
There weren't another other way to be  
For them lovable losers and no account boozers  
And honky tonk heroes like me

There is a house down in New Orleans  
They call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me  
Oh God, I'm one  
My mother was a tailor  
She sowed these old blue jeans  
My father was a gambler, Lord  
Down in New Orleans  
The only thing a gambler needs  
Is a suitcase and a trunk  
And the only time he's ever satisfied  
Is when he's on a drunk  
Go tell my baby sister  
Not to do the the things I've done  
Outshine that house down in New Orleans  
That they call the Rising Sun  
There is a house down in New Orleans  
That they call the Rising Sun  
And it's been the ruin for many a poor boy and me  
Oh God, I'm one  

Take back the weed take back the cocaine baby  
Take back the pills take back the whiskey too  
I don't need them now your love was all I was after  
I'll make it now I can get off on you  
I can get by on little or nothing at all I know  
I can get high just thinkin' about you and so  
Well take back the weed...  
  
Who would have thought this was somethin' that I'd ever do  
I'm working it out mellowing out on you  
Take back the weed...  
Take back the weed...

You know I can't stand to be around you cause you know I'm still in love with
you  
And my arms keep reaching to do what my thoughts do all the time  
I just can't keep my hands off of you  
Cause it's like looking at heaven while I'm standing in hell  
We shared something precious for a while  
You look just like a baby in a cradle to me I just can't keep my hands off of
you  
Woman you've got the man inside my body trembling the way only you know how to  
And I guess that's just one of a million reasons I just can't keep my hands
off of you  
Cause it's like looking at heaven...

[Chorus:]  
In my own way I'm a believer  
In my own way right or wrong  
I don't talk too much about it  
It's something I keep working on  
I don't have too much to build on  
My faith has never been that strong  
  
There's a man in that old building  
He's a holy man, they say  
He keeps talking about tomorrow  
While I keep struggling with today  
He preaches hell, fire and brimstone  
And heaven seems so far away  
  
I do believe in a higher power  
One that loves us one and all  
Not someone to solve our problems  
Or to catch me when I fall  
He gave us all a mind to think with  
And to know what's right or wrong  
He is that inner spirit  
That keeps us strong  
  
[Chorus]

I don't mind I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind  
It used to break my heart each time you cheated  
I tried to leave the Lord knows how I tried  
But I stay here no matter how I'm treated and all it really cost me was my
pride  
But I don't mind I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind  
You and I have a perfect understanding you come and you go as you please  
And I never get too angry or demanding it's hard to get mad on your knees  
But I don't mind I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind  
Once I was strong as a mountain I stood tall like a giant oak tree  
Now my blood runs thin like water in a fountain you took all the man out of me  
But I don't mind baby I don't mind I did for a time but I don't mind

You don't know what's good for you you won't leave me alone  
I know you've got a family sleepin' at home  
Don't make me go out off my way don't tempt me please  
Don't you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
I'm all alone and need someone I guess that it shows  
But the things you make me want to do I'll regret I know  
So don't say things that you don't mean cause I just might believe  
Don't you be so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
I'm gonna leave tonight with you go on and have your fun  
I don't want to be a part of what I might have done  
I'm tempted when I think about the things that might have been  
And I'll admit I'd like to try but I know I couldn't win  
And so instead I'll say goodbye I know it's time to leave  
'Cause you been so nice to me and I fall in love so easily  
  
'Cause you been so nice to me I fall in love so easily  
  
'Cause you been so nice to me

I took my woman down to the local depot  
From there to anywhere if you want to you can go  
I said now pretty momma I've had myself enough  
Of your fussing and your fighting and it's sure gonna get rough  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the train sittin' waitin'  
Leaving right on time  
So if you want to go,better get aboard  
But you be the one to make up your mind  
  
I've tried to love you woman every way I know how  
But you keep on a naggin' and I've had it starting now  
If you don't like the way you're living you know what you can do  
Said the trains sitting there it's a big black choo-choo  
  
I got the train sittin' waitin'  
Leaving right on time  
So if you want to go,get yourself aboard  
But you be the one to make up your mind  
  
Well, I looked up at the schedule and it said nine thirteen  
The central is a leaving all the lights are turning green  
The whistle is a blowin' here's your ticket and your pass  
The door is open wide so don't let your coat tail drag  
  
[Chorus]

When I was one, till I was three  
My mom and dad took care of me  
Now I'm four and the world's alive  
And I just can't wait until I'm five.  
  
I just can't wait until I'm five.  
  
When I am six there is a rule  
Kids like me all start to school  
Somewhere between seven and eight  
I'll start to grow and I just can't wait.  
  
I'll start to grow and I just can't wait.  
  
Nine is weird as it can be  
My brother's nine and he picks on me  
But I just can't wait until I'm ten  
I'll be completely grown by then.  
  
I'll be completely grown by then

Little girl don't be so quit to give your love so free  
Little girl what makes you want to throw yourself with me  
Just in your teens you're lookin' more like twenty one  
You run ahead of life when it's only just begun  
Don't you know I may never pass this way again  
Little girl you'd better go before I'd change my mind  
Little girl walk away while you still have the time  
It's just a part of growin' up someday you'll see  
Then you'll wonder what you ever saw in me  
Don't you know I may never pass this way again  
Mama sets home awaitin' you to call by now daddy's lookin' tired  
Wonder what can she be and what she's doin' out now late at night  
Little girl you better go before I lose all sense and my control  
I'll be crossed bridge down on the road and you'll be left behind to pay the
toll  
I may never pass this way again  
Little girl wait for him he'll soon be on his way  
Little girl you think within what I'd do today  
It's just a part of growin' up someday you'll see  
And then you'll wonder what you ever saw in me  
Don't you know I may never pass this way again I may never pass this way again
hmm

The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all  
The sky was never blue  
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall  
And I never cared for you  
  
I know you won't believe these things I tell you  
No, you won't believe  
Your heart has been forewarned  
All men will lie to you  
Your mind cannot conceive  
Now all depends on what I say to you  
And on your doubting me  
So I've prepared these statements far from true  
Pay heed and disbelieve  
  
The sun is filled with ice and gives no warmth at all  
The sky was never blue  
The stars are raindrops searching for a place to fall  
And I never cared for you

Silver coins that jingle jangle  
Fancy shoes that dance in time  
Oh, the secrets of her dark eyes  
They did sing a gypsy rhyme.  
  
Yellow clover entangled blossoms  
In a meadow silky green  
Where she held me to her bosom  
Just a boy of seventeen.  
  
I recall a gypsy woman  
Silver spangles in her eyes  
Ivory skin against the moonlight  
And the taste of life's sweet wine.  
  
Soft breezes blow from fragrant meadows  
Stir the darkness in my mind  
Oh, gentle woman you sleep beside me  
And little know who haunts my mind.  
  
Gypsy lady I hear your laughter  
And it dances in my head  
While my tender wife and babies  
Slumber softly in their bed.  
  
I recall a gypsy woman  
Silver spangles in her eyes  
Ivory skin against the moonlight  
And the taste of life's sweet wine

So long to you, hope I don't make you blue,  
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.  
Apart we've grown, now I can't go on alone.  
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.  
  
Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.  
Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.  
Send the rest to my hole in the ground.  
  
I bow my head, cause in the mornin' I'm a gonna be dead.  
Think I'm gonna kill myself, think I'm gonna myself.  
  
Now dig my grave with a silver spade, a gold chain lay me down and down.  
Send my remains to my best friend, the rest to my hole in the ground.  
Send the rest to my hole in the ground.

How many times must I tell her  
How many times must I say  
I won't be around to pick her up again  
From now on she'll have to find her own way.  
  
How many years have I loved her  
While she stood by so unconcerned  
But the things she don't know I'll teach her when I go  
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
I think it's time she learned  
Love can't live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
I think it's time she learned  
Love can't live when love is not returned  
She thought that I would always stand by  
But she's been wrong and I think it's time she learned.  
  
She's been wrong and I think it's time she learned

This world that I live in is empty and cold the loneliness cuts me and
tortures my soul  
I'm no child of destiny and no fortune's son  
I've just chased you so long now I'm too weak to run  
A new day is here but nothing is new alone in my room I tremble for you  
[ piano ]  
I know I'll return to the backstreets again to find what I need to prove I'm a
man  
And there I'll treat shame like an old friend from home  
That I can lean on till my misery is gone  
A new day is here and nothing is new I'm a picture of weakness as I tremble
for you

I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  
I keep my eyes wide open all the time  
I keep the ends out for the ties that bind  
Because you're mine I walk the line  
I find it very, very easy to be true  
I find myself by myself when each day is through  
I'll admit that I'm a fool for you  
Because you're mine I walk the line  
I'll admit that I'm a fool for you  
Because you're mine, let me, I walk in the line  
I keep a close watch on this heart of mine  
I keep my eyes wide open all the time  

Your love, I'm no longer sure of  
Seems there's times you'd rather be alone  
And if I'm losing you tell me what did I do  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong  
Even though I still feel the same  
I can't help but feel I'm to blame  
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong  
Even though I still feel the same  
I can't help but feel I'm to blame  
Have I done all that I can do to show my love for you  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong  
Oh, I wonder just where I went wrong  

This morning as I watched a bird  
Just spread its wings and fly  
It was then a thought came over me  
And I wondered why can't I  
Oh why, oh why can't I?  
  
If I could only fly you see  
A lot of problems would be gone  
When you think of just  
How much I'd save on shoes alone  
If I could only fly.  
  
I would never tear my clothes  
Climbing in and out of trees  
If I could only fly I'd never crawl  
Or wear holes in my knees  
If I could only fly.  
  
How I'd love to spread my wings  
And streak across the sky  
I'd be off to see the world  
If I could only fly.  
  
But I'd always come right back

If you really want me to, I'll go  
It's not that I want to, but I'll go  
If you've found somebody who could love you more than me  
If you really want me to, I'll go.  
  
I don't know just what you're tryin' to do  
You told me that your love for me was true  
I don't understand my love, please tell me what to do  
If you really want me to, I'll go.  
  
I need you more than you know  
Ask me to do anything but go  
I can hardly talk, afraid I'll cry  
Just can't bring myself to say goodbye.  
  
Don't tell me that it's over  
I don't wanna know  
If you really want me to  
I'll go.  
  
I need you more than you know  
Ask me to do anything but go  
I can hardly talk, afraid I'll cry  
Just can't bring myself to say goodbye.  
  
Don't tell me that it's over  
I don't wanna know  
If you really want me to  
I'll go.  
  
If you really want me to, I'll go

If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her the times have but I have not changed  
All my friends know that I still feel the same  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
  
If you see her ask her for me  
If the dreamer in her ever set her free  
Does she know now what the words I sing mean  
If you see her would you ask her for me  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything I told her then was true  
Everything was true at the time  
But time has a way of changing everything  
The truth has a way of changing all the time  
  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her for me that she was not to blame  
There's no reason now for her to feel ashamed  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you see her and she mentions my name  
Tell her the times have but I have not changed  
All my friends know that I still feel the same  
If you see her and she mentions my name

If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go  
Cause that would mean you once belonged to me  
I'd gladly take the heartache of losing you some day  
Cause then at least I'd have the memory  
Through all the years I've known you you've never noticed me  
Just a friend that's all I've been to you  
I'd gladly let you break my heart for just one memory  
Just to know that you were mine to lose  
If I could only hold you just one time for one short moment heaven would be
mine  
If you were mine to lose I'd gladly let you go just to know that you were mine
to lose  
I could only hold you...  
  
  

I've been down the Mississippi,  
Down through New Orleans,  
Yes, I have.  
I've played in California,  
  
There ain't too much I haven't seen.  
No, there ain't.  
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't fool around with a ramblin' man.  
  
Left a girl in West Virginia,  
Up there where that green grass grows,  
Yes, I did.  
Another girl in Cincinnati,  
  
Waitin' where the Ohio River flows,  
Poor girl!  
I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't give your heart to a ramblin' man.  
  
You'd better move away,  
You're standin' too close to the flame.  
Once I mess with your mind,  
Your little heart won't beat the same.  
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man,  
  
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin' man.  
Better not!  
Well, up in Chicago,  
I was known as "Quiet Boy,"  
  
Yes, I was!  
Down in Alabama,  
They call me "The man of joy,"  
Still do!  
  
Well, I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't fall in love with a ramblin' man.  
You'd better move away,  
You're standin' too close to the flame.  
  
Once I mess with your mind,  
Your little heart won't beat the same.  
Lord, I'm a ramblin' man,  
Don't mess around with any ol' ramblin' man.

I'm coming back to you one more time  
To give you one more chance to clear your mind  
I know how much you don't want to be free so I'm doing this for you not for me  
All you have to do is apologize I'll be there soon as I dry my eyes  
I know how much you don't want to be free so I'm doing this for you not for me  
[ guitar ]  
All you have to do is apologize...  
I'm doing this for you not for me  
  
  

That's the very same door that I carried her through  
On the night we were married last June  
And right over there is the very same chair that she sat in when she said
we're through  
Over here you can see where I got on my knees and I begged but her heart was a
stone  
Over here's where I cried did you know I'd died right here in this very same
room  
  
To your right there's a crib and it's never been used perhaps that's why we're
apart  
And there sits a phone that she used on alone to make plans with her new
sweetheart  
Then she walked over here and she picked up her things then left me alone in
the gloom  
Over here's where I cried did you know I'd died right here in this very same
room  
Right here in this very same room

Now that I've made up my mind you're gone it should be easier now  
Perhaps now my heart will stop hanging on it should be easier now  
The lesson I've learned from you gold can't buy a heart can be broken and
still survive  
Thanks to you now a much wiser man am I and it should be easier now  
  
The worst now is over I've stood the test it should be easier now  
They say everything happens for the best it should be easier now  
The wounds in my heart you've carved deep and wide  
Hollowed and washed by the tears I've cried  
But now there'll be more room for love inside and it should be easier now

[Verse 1:]  
If anyone ever finds a better way to love  
It'll be her,loving me  
If anyone ever goes out of their way to show they care  
It'll be her,loving me  
[Chorus:]  
  
She's every women I've ever known rolled up in one  
If I'm ever loved anymore,she'll be the one  
To get it done,the way it should be  
It'll be her,loving me  
[Verse 2:]  
  
If ever I'm down and out and need someone to love  
It'll be her,loving me  
When everyone else is cold and i need someone warm to hold  
It'll be her,loving me  
[Chorus(x2)]

Well my baby used to stay out all night long she made me cry she done me wrong  
Come home each morning tellin' me them same old lies  
But now table has turned and it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her but it's all over now  
  
Oh yes I used to love her but it's all over now  
Well she started runnin' round with every man in town  
Spending all my money playin' a high class game  
She would never change no matter how I tried  
  
But the table has turned and it's her turn to cry  
Because I used to love her...  
I used to wake up in the morning get my breakfast in bed  
When I was worried she would ease my achin' head  
  
Now she's here and there with every guy in town  
Still tryin' to take me for that same old clown  
Because I used to love her...

J. J. Cale's my hero, best I ever heard  
But you gotta sing a little louder, hoss, 'cause I can't hear the words  
Some folks call it rock and roll, others call it blues  
But I detect a country soul, when I seen his cowboy shoes  
And it's alright  
It's alright  
It may not be right, but it's alright  
  
George might show up flyin' high, if George shows up at all  
But he may be, unconsciously, the greatest of them all  
From the Beatles and me in Nashville, to the billies and the Rolling Stones  
If we all sounded like we wanted to, we'd all sound like George Jones  
And it's alright  
It's alright  
It may not be right, but it's alright  
  
Jesse she's my woman boys, poor little ugly thing  
She tells me just how smart I am, so I'll teach her how to sing  
When I'm wrong and then she nails me, I get her with the same old line  
And it's alright  
It's alright  
It may not be right, but it's alright

It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know I love you  
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to control you  
And like the other little children you're gonna dream a dream or two  
But be careful what you're dreamin' or soon your dreams'll be dreamin' you  
It's not supposed to be that way you're supposed to know I love you  
But it don't matter anyway if I can't be there to console you  
You go out to play this evenin' play with fire flies till they're gone  
Then you rush to meet your lover play with real fire till the dawn  
It's not supposed to be that way

It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
The Johnny Comelateleys are comin' in early  
The early birds showin' up late  
The straightmen all wanna be funny  
The funny men all wanna get straight  
The villains have turned into heroes  
The heroes have turned into heels  
The dealers all wanna be lovers  
And the lovers all wanna make deals  
[unverified] they ain't inherited nothin'  
The leaders are fallin' behind  
So I'm singin' my songs to the deaf men  
Dancing my dance to the blind  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
It's the world's gone crazy  
And ladies are dancin' and the sidemen  
And the frontmen, we'chome  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
It's the world's gone crazy cotillion  
The ladies are dancing alone  
'Cos the sidemen all wanna be frontmen  
And the frontmen all wanna go home  
...  

I've always been crazy and the trouble that it's put me through  
And busted for things that I did, and I didn't do  
I can't say I'm proud of all of the things that I've done  
But I can say I've never intentionally hurt anyone  
  
I've always been different with one foot over the line  
Winding up somewhere one step ahead or behind  
It ain't been so easy but I guess I shouldn't complain  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane  
  
Beautiful lady are you sure that you understand  
The chances your taking loving a free living man  
Are you really sure you really want what you see  
Be careful of something that's just what you want it to be  
  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane  
Nobody knows if it's something to bless or to blame  
So, far I ain't found a rhyme or a reason to change  
I've always been crazy but it's kept me from going insane

I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see  
I won't be much when you get through with me  
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
Well, every night you drag me where the bright lights are found  
There ain't no way to slowin' you down  
I'm about as helpless as a leaf in a gale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see  
I won't be much when you get through with me  
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
I thought the day I met you you were meek as a lamb  
Just the kind to fit my dreams and plans  
Now the pace we've been living takes the wind from my sails  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail.  
  
I've got a tiger by the tail it's plain to see  
I won't be much when you get through with me  
I'm losing weight and turning mighty pale  
And it looks like I've got a tiger by the tail

When I look at you I think many strange things  
And it's hard to express all of my feelings  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
I had to call and tell you just how I felt  
You should know by now that  
When you're near my heart melts  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
Eyes for you, eyes for you  
Yes I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
In my sleep I call your name  
No one to blame I can't explain  
And every time I see you it's the same thing  
And I try to escape from looking your way.  
I belong to a girl you hang around with  
But I must admit I've got eyes for you.  
  
Must admit I've got eyes for you, mm  
I must admit I've got eyes for you

When I married Julie she was just seventeen  
Pretty as the answer to any man's dream  
  
From the start I gave Julie all the love that I've had  
Though everyone told me that Julie was bad  
Julie liked parties and clothes that fit tight  
Drinking and dancin' around late at night  
She was everything evil with the face of a child  
But I sat home and waited while my Julie went wild  
I had built me an empire with my own two hands  
With the money and power to break any man  
But with all my possessions power and gold Julie was one thing I couldn't
control  
I gave Julie all my money could buy begged her to love me but she wouldn't try  
She'd only laugh then walk out the door  
Each time she'd hurt me made me love her more  
  
Now I'm locked in this room they say I'm insane  
And I guess that I'll never see my Julie again  
I'm a man with a heart and a tormented soul  
And the mind that Julie drove out of control

Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through  
Someone's gonna pay for the things you do  
How many hearts must break,how many will it take  
To satisfy you,just to satisfy you  
  
Another love,another fool  
To play your game  
Another love,another fool  
They're all the same  
  
Someone's gonna get hurt before you're through  
Don't be surprised if that someone is you  
You're gonna find when it's too late,a heart that just won't break  
To satisfy you,just to satisfy you  
  
How many tears were cried,how many dreams have died  
To satisfy you,just to satisfy you

Kentucky woman  
She shines with her own kind of light  
She'd look at you once  
And a day that's all wrong  
Looks all right  
And I love her  
God knows, I love her  
  
Kentucky woman  
If she get to know you  
She goin' to own you  
Kentucky woman  
  
Well, she ain't the kind  
Makes heads turn at the drop of her name  
But something inside  
That she's got turn you on just the same  
And she loves me  
God knows, she loves me  
  
Kentucky woman  
If she get to know you  
She goin' to own you  
Kentucky woman  
  
I don't want much  
The good Lord's earth beneath my feet  
A gentle touch  
From that one girl, and life is  
Sweet and good  
Ain't no doubt  
I'm talkin' about  
  
Kentucky woman  
If she get to know you  
She goin' to own you  
Kentucky woman

I've learned to turn the other cheek  
Is not what love's about  
I've turned mine so many times  
That I damned near wore 'em out  
I've grown used to your abuse  
And I thought I'd never quit  
But I woke up this morning  
Couldn't find my shiv-a-git  
You've always liked to play your games  
Well, I got one for you  
Pretend we're playing checkers, girl  
And it's your time to move  
You'll find your suitcase on the porch  
And the taxi in the drive  
So get your tongue out of my mouth  
I'm kissing you goodbye  
I see you've finally made it home  
You been out all night  
Your artificial hair's a mess  
And your clothes don't fit you right  
I've given and forgiven  
Till there ain't nothing left  
But all you gave was just enough  
To satisfy yourself  
I can smell that whiskey in your hair  
And Sen-Sen on your breath  
If you ever tried to tell the truth  
You'd choke yourself to death  
I don't want your nasty kisses  
And don't tell me no more lies  
Get your tongue out of my mouth  
I'm kissing you goodbye  
Get your tongue out of my mouth  
I'm kissing you goodbye  

South bound out of Shreveport heading hell bent for his grave  
He reads a sign on the barn door that says the good lord Jesus saves  
But I don't think Jesus knows him 'cause he ain't the Jesus kind  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
He gave the folks a good show at the Shreveport Coliseum  
They all heard he's dying, so they all come out to see  
Friends and neighbors make him happy  
Lord them snuff queens treat him kind  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Uppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him down  
His old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drown  
He keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna find  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Big Bertha, back in Beaumont says he really turns her on  
She hits the floor a dancing, when the DJ plays his song  
You can see somebody loves him, or at least they did one time  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind  
  
Uppers, downers, turn arounders picked him up and laid him down  
His old troubles keep on swimming 'cause their to damn mean to drown  
He keeps looking for an answer I know he's never gonna find  
He's a laid back country picker with a laid back country mind

[Verse 1:]  
Traveling down on different roads  
Trying hard to leave the load  
We take it there but we can't let go  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
[Verse 2:]  
Back in Eden we were tried  
Found ourselves dissatisfied  
Seeking wisdom that she denied  
Trying hard to lay it down  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lay it down brother,lay it down  
It's so hard to lay it down  
  
[Verse 3:]  
Hide in me,confide in me  
Don't you think it's time to be  
Everything we tried to be  
You and me sould lay it down  
  
[Verse 4:]  
Speak to me,be unashamed  
There's no need in playing games  
After all we're all the same  
Just trying hard to lay it down  
  
[Chorus.]  
  
[Verse 5:(a tone higher)]  
Wish my words could make it well  
Wish that I could break the shell  
Take us from ourself made well  
Find a way to lay it down  
  
[Verse 6:(a tone higher)]  
Burdened by the things I've learned  
Hurting because I'm too concerned  
Nonetheless I confess I yearn  
To find a way to lay it down  
  
[Chorus bis:(a tone higher)]  
Lay it down,lay it down  
Wish that I could lay it down

There she goes again see her smiling so happy with the new love that she's
found  
See her whisper in my ear all those things I used to hear  
Oh how that hurts me so I'm leavin' town she's the reason why I'm leavin' town  
I'm going far away where no one knows me when morning comes well I won't be
around  
To see her whisper in his ear kiss and call him dear  
Oh I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town  
  
I'm going far away where no one knows me when morning comes well I won't be

To see her whisper in his ear kiss and call him dear  
Oh I can't stand that so I'm leavin' town packin' up my hurt and leavin' town  
Mm leavin' town bet she's even glad I'm leavin' town

Can I stay with you awhile right awhile behind your smile  
You don't have to say the things you used to say  
Just let me sleep here for a time in the want of your loving mind  
And tomorrow I'll be on my way  
Just hold me in the want of your gentle smile  
Just tonight hon with you then I'll be going on my way  
Just hide me till I have I have the strength to go  
For now all I want to know is morning by your side  
Let me stay with you awhile right awhile behind your smile  
You don't have to say the things you used to say  
Just let me sleep here for a time in the want of your loving mind  
Awhile till I find the strength to go

Darling let's turn back my years  
And go back to yesterday  
Let's pretend that time has stopped  
And I didn't go away.  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
It wasn't meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So darling, let's turn back the years.  
  
We had our love to make us happy  
It wasn't meant to bring us tears  
Love like ours should never die  
So darling, let's turn back the years.  
  
Darling let's turn back my years  
And go back to yesterday  
Let's pretend that time has stopped  
And I didn't go away.  
  
Darling let's turn back my years  
And go back to yesterday  
Let's pretend that time has stopped  
And I didn't go away.

Down the street a baby just cried  
When he woke up all alone  
A train's leavin' town and that lonesome old sound  
Is chilling me right to the bone.  
  
A song is playing I can barely hear  
About a love that's gone wrong  
The freezing rain on my window pane  
Listen they're playing my song.  
  
Taps being played by a soldier's grave  
So sad it torments your soul  
Just listen to that north wind moan  
Tonight it's so dark and cold.  
  
Somewhere a siren cuts through the night  
Sounds like a whole world's gone wrong  
Thunder just warned but it's coming a storm  
Listen they're playing my song

Someday I won't come running when you call  
The way you hurt me it's a wonder I'm still here at all  
Someday you'll wake up and you'll find yourself alone  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.  
  
I can't go on the way you make me live  
Make me cry and every time expect me to forgive  
Someday you'll wake up to a cold and lifted dawn  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.  
  
Someday I'll wake up find me strength and move along  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone.  
Lock, stock and teardrops I'll be gone

Oh well, it's long gone, long gone  
You got my baby and you're long gone  
But I'll be a hangin' around  
I know you're gonna put her down  
She'll need someone that's true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find you're long gone, long gone.  
  
You just wandered into town  
Took her and you started messin' around, with my baby  
You stole her heart 'cause she ain't used to your kind.  
With your fancy clothes and your uptown style  
It didn't take you but a little while to get your way  
'Cause your pretty little lies she couldn't see behind.  
  
And now it's long gone, long gone  
You got my baby and you're long gone  
But I'll be a hangin' around  
I know you're gonna put her down  
She'll need someone that's true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find you're long gone, long gone.  
  
Well, a man in me would like to fight  
To take you down by the river tonight  
And rearrange your face  
But that would make her hate the site of me.  
  
So there's nothing left for me to do  
Standin', watchin' that, the likes of me  
Hurt the girl I love while she's too much  
In love with you to see.  
  
Oh well, it's long gone, long gone  
You got my baby and you're long gone  
But I'll be a hangin' around  
I know you're gonna put her down  
She'll need someone that's true  
When she wakes up one day  
To find you're long gone, long gone
