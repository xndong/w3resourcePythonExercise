I feel I'm burning up with fever  
The fire's feeling really good tonight  
But it's all right  
'Cause I'm gonna see Sahara Jack and Suntan Sally  
Somebody tells me even Tommy's coming down  
Tonight, If Gina says it's all right  
  
I'm gonna see those senoritas lying under the sun  
Yeah they're greasing it up with their stereos on  
You know I want to be their blanket, gonna tell every girl  
Hey baby you're the one  
  
[Chorus:]  
Whoa, tell the boys I'm on my way  
I got the radio blasting in my old man's Chevrolet  
I got a party in my pocket,  
And you know I just got paid  
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade.  
  
When the sun goes down, that's when the street heats up  
Senorita, margarita, fills your empty cup tonight  
She makes me feel so right  
A good time here doesn't cost much money  
Just a little sweet talking, let the pretties in the party  
And you're set for life  
Or one hell of a night  
  
I can see those sons of beaches  
Out there livin' it up  
In the surf and the sand,  
Man, that life ain't so tough  
So get me in the action  
Let me tell every girl she's the one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I'm feeling fine, it's 99 in the shade  
(I can almost taste it! )  
  
99, 99, 99  
99 in the shade  
99, 99,  
99 in the, whoa!  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got the radio cranked in my old man's Chevrolet

Are. Sambora  
  
When I look at you  
Youre beautiful  
There comes a time in someones life  
When you find things that matter  
And every time we touch  
The love runs deep  
We realize it's our to keep  
And that's all that really matters.  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true  
Aint no me without you.  
When you're in the dark  
Baby don't despair  
I'm just a spark away  
I will be there  
And that's all that matters.  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true  
Aint no me without you.  
Well share our lives together  
Yes our flame burns on forever  
And at the final curtain call  
We can say we did it all.  
Solo  
Youll always be my sweet addiction  
In this life my saving grace  
Youre all that really matters  
You know it's true  
Aint no me without you.  
And when we turns to dust  
And we fly away  
Therell be a light stil burning bright  
And that's all that really matters.

Amen  
Last night I had a dream  
The dream I had was true  
I fell through the stars  
Went walking on the moon  
Burned like a thousand candles in her arms  
  
The skin under my finger tips  
Honeysuckle on her lips  
Sweeter than a man deserves to taste  
Mercy, mercy, what else can I say?  
  
But amen, amen, amen  
  
Last night we were born together  
It was like we'd always been  
She'll be with me forever  
If I don't see her again  
We poured the wine until our cup ran over  
  
Unfolding like the mystery  
Inside of her like poetry  
A thousand horses running through my veins  
Mercy, mercy what else can I say  
  
Amen, amen, amen  
  
I laid down in her garden  
Naked on her floor  
Windows up, the curtains blowing  
She don't lock the door  
  
Amen, amen  
  
At the banquet table  
A beggar at a feast  
I felt her tongue between her lips  
And I forgot to breath  
We stayed there 'til the candles burned the carpet  
  
Last night I had a dream  
The dream I had was true  
Mercy, mercy, what else can I say  
Mercy, mercy, I laid down and prayed  
  
Amen, amen  
Amen, amen

Alarm clock rings, 6:45  
Must have hit that snooze button least three times  
Wishing this morning was still last night  
On any other day, just might wanna die  
  
Traffic backed up 20 miles to the east  
Must have hit every damn red light on the street  
Weatherman says "It's gonna rain for a week"  
Hey, what can you do?  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you  
  
On any other day, I would just go crazy  
The breaks are only gonna save me  
Baby luck and love  
Will pull us through?  
On any other day  
  
On any other day, I might just stay in bed  
Sit down in a sea of blankets  
Pull them up over my head  
Get your papers in the morning  
Just to get a little edge  
Then maybe just give up in time to do it all again  
  
Hey, I like where this is going  
Yeah, 'cause I know where it's been  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you  
  
On any other day, I would just go crazy  
The breaks are only gonna save me  
Baby luck and love  
Will pull us through?  
On any other day  
Yeah, yeah!  
  
Alarm clock rings, 6:45  
I like waking up with you on my mind  
Knowing that you're saving me  
One more time  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you  
  
On any other day, I would just go crazy  
The breaks are only gonna save me  
Baby luck and love  
Will pull us through?  
On any other day  
  
Whoa  
Oh yeah, yeah  
Oh yeah, yeah  
  
On any other day, I've been blue, I was cryin'  
I could tell the world, at least I'm tryin'  
The clouds are breakin'  
The sun is shinin' new for me and you

J. Bon jovi  
  
It was another day  
A perfect texas afternoon  
A mother and two children play  
The way they always do  
As they raced home from the mailbox  
A mother and her son  
Against a little girl of 6 years old  
The independant one  
  
The deputies went door to door  
Through all the neighborhood  
They said I got some news to tell you folks  
I'm afraid it aint so good  
Somehow something happened  
Someone got away  
Someone got the answers for what happened here today  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15  
  
Now the people from the papers and the local tv news  
Tried to find the reason  
Cop dogs sniffed around for clues  
Someone shouted hit and run  
The coroner cried foul  
Her blue dress was what she wore  
The day they laid her body down  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15  
  
I know tonight that theres an angel  
Up on heavens highest hill  
And no one there can hurt you baby  
No one ever will  
Somewhere someones conscience is like a burning bed  
The flames are all around you  
How you gonna sleep again  
  
Oh no, oh no, oh no, no, no, no  
  
Tell me it was just a dream - august 7 4: 15  
God closed his eyes and the world got mean  
August 7 4: 15

Backdoor to heaven  
  
Well, now we're alone  
My heart's in your hands I need someone to love  
Can't I be your friend I feel your rebel to me, baby  
  
Won't you give me what's wrong or right now  
You got me praying oh baby, on my knees  
Won't you let me in, let me in, let me in  
Your backdoor to heaven is in your arms tonight  
You're my backdoor to heaven  
Won't you let me in, let me in, let me in  
  
I'm just a sinner but ain't that all the same  
So let me in, let me in, let me in  
The backdoor to heaven is in your arms to heaven  
You're my backdoor to heaven  
Baby you gotta let me in, let me in, let me in  
The backdoor to heaven  
Yeah, baby, it's my time  
You're my backdoor to heaven.

Every day it's the same when they say that it might be the end  
In the end when it ends then I'll listen to them  
You wake up, go to work, go to sleep, then you do it, you do it  
If you're lucky then you do it again  
  
Yeah we walk through a world that we don't understand  
When I look in your eyes I'm just happy I can  
Yeah we'll laugh and we'll cry and we'll lose and we'll win  
We'll get through it and to prove it, yeah we'll do it again  
There's glory in the saddest story  
  
Look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world  
  
It's a shame when they say that's it's been done and said  
they keep digging that grave,let them bury their heads  
there's a kid with a dream and a sky full of stars  
there's another first kiss, in the back of some car  
Turn the page and write the story  
  
Look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world.  
  
They're running numbers out of the Spanish coast  
Winery merry Mary says her rosary  
we get a ladder, cause there's a cat up in a tree  
Ah, the pretzel mans wearing Gucci glasses  
A widow spreads her lover's ashes  
I hold on to you, hold on to me, yeah  
  
We'll do it, we'll do it, if we're lucky then we'll do it again  
  
Ah, look at it, just sticks and bricks  
Makes you wonder how the pieces fit  
Where we go and where we've been  
This ain't paradise we're living in  
It's a diamond, it's a dirty plastic pearl  
  
Ah, but ain't it a beautiful world  
Ain't it a beautiful world  
Oh ain't it a beautiful world  
Oh ain't it a beautiful world

I just seen trouble  
He's calling out your name tonight  
Billy get your guns  
  
You could walk away  
But I know you were born to fight  
So billy get your guns  
  
The bandoleers are strung out  
In the promenade  
Billy get your guns  
  
Billy get your guns  
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
That's the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And it'll never change  
Billy get your guns  
  
There's a whiskey bottle empty  
Sittin' on the bar  
Billy get your guns  
And some organ grinder singing  
About some sucker moving on  
Billy get your guns  
  
All the whores are hanging out  
Waiting to get paid  
Billy get your guns  
From some johnny on the spot  
Who said hey keep the change baby  
  
Billy get your guns  
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
That's the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And it'll never change  
  
They christened you with whiskey  
And there's fire running through your veins  
Well you're an outlaw just the same  
And every night a bullet wears your name  
  
I've seen hangman dancing  
Beneath the pale moonlight  
Billy get your guns  
And every stranger that you meet  
Thinks it's his lucky night  
Billy get your guns  
  
I don't envy you billy  
But I want to say  
You better get your guns  
'cause every outlaw that's died  
Will live to ride again  
Billy get your guns  
  
Billy get your guns  
There's trouble blowing like a hurricane  
Billy get your guns  
That's the price on your head for the  
Price of fame  
And it'll never change  
Billy get your guns

I wake up in the morning  
And I raise my weary head  
I've got an old coat for a pillow  
And the earth was last night's bed  
I don't know where I'm going  
Only God knows where I've been  
I'm a devil on the run  
A six gun lover  
A candle in the wind  
  
When you're brought into this world  
They say you're born in sin  
Well at least they gave me something  
I didn't have to steal or have to win  
Well they tell me that I'm wanted  
Yeah, I'm a wanted man  
I'm a colt in your stable  
I'm what Cain was to Abel  
Mister catch me if you can  
  
I'm going out in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
I'm going out in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
I'm no one's son  
Call me young gun  
  
You ask about my conscience  
And I offer you my soul  
You ask if I'll grow to be a wise man  
Well I ask if I'll grow old  
You ask me if I've known love  
And what it's like to sing songs in the rain  
Well, I've seen love come  
And I've seen it shot down  
I've seen it die in vain  
  
Shot down in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
'Cause I'm going down in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
I'm the devil's son  
Call me young gun  
  
Each night I go to bed  
I pray the Lord my soul to keep  
No I ain't looking for forgiveness  
But before I'm six foot deep  
Lord, I got to ask a favor  
And hope you'll understand  
'Cause I've lived life to the fullest  
Let this boy die like a man  
Staring down a bullet  
Let me make my final stand  
  
Shot down in a blaze of glory  
Take me now but know the truth  
I'm going out in a blaze of glory  
Lord I never drew first  
But I drew first blood  
And I'm no one's son  
Call me young gun  
I'm a young gun  
Young gun, yeah yeah yeah  
Young gun

I can still remember  
When I was just a kid  
When friends were friends forever  
And what you said was what you did  
  
Well, it was me and Dan and Bobby  
We cut each other's hands  
And held tight to a promise  
Only brothers understand  
  
But we were so young (so young)  
One for all and all for one (for one)  
Just as sure as the river's gonna run  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
We'd still be standing  
When all was said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And I'll be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Well, Bobby was our hero  
Cause he hed a fake I.D.  
I got busted stealing cigarettes  
And he took the rap for me  
  
Danny knew this white trash girl  
We each threw in a ten  
She took us to this cheap motel  
And turned us into men  
  
We were so young (so young)  
One for all and all for one (for one)  
Just as sure as the river's gonna run  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
We'd still be standing  
When all is said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And I'll be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Now Bobby, he's an uptown lawyer  
Danny, he's a medicin man  
And me, I'm just the singer  
In a long haired rock'n'roll band  
  
Through the years and miles between us  
It's been a long and lonely ride  
But if I got a call in the dead of the night  
I'd be right by your side  
  
Blood on blood, blood on blood  
  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
We'd still be standing  
When all is said and done  
Blood on blood  
One on one  
And I'll be here for you  
Till Kingdom come  
Blood on blood  
  
Blood on blood

You call every hour, but there's nothing to say  
So talk to me now, before it's too late  
Oh they say it couldn't happen, but I saw your picture breathe  
That fifty dollar doctor said your love is a disease  
I'm alright, I'm okay  
Still I don't know how, and I don't know why  
But the talk turns to shop, and so we stand on the edge of goodbye  
Is this the end of the beginning, or beginning of an end  
Are you friend or the enemy, or enemy or the friend  
I walk the borderline  
Between day and the night, wrong and the right  
Borderline  
The voices they scream from inside of me  
On the borderline  
I walk the borderline  
I hear talk on the streets, I hear rumors of you  
The people I meet say, that the lies are all true  
And I wake up in a cold sweat, find you lying fast asleep  
Is my dream a reality, reality a dream  
I've crossed the borderline  
Between day and the night, wrong and the right  
Borderline  
The voices they scream from inside of me  
On the borderline  
I walk the borderline  
I walk the borderline  
Between day and the night, wrong and the right  
Borderline  
The voices they scream from inside of me  
On the borderline  
I walk the borderline  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  

I guess this time you're really leaving  
I heard your suitcase say goodbye  
Well as my broken heart lies bleeding  
You say true love is suicide  
You say you've cried a thousand rivers  
And now you're swimming for the shore  
You left me drowning in my tears  
And you won't save me anymore  
I'm praying to God you'll give me one more chance girl  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you  
When you breathe, I want to be the air for you  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you  
Words can't say what love can do  
I'll be there for you  
  
I know you know we've had some good times  
Now they have their own hiding place  
Well I can promise you tomorrow  
But I can't buy back yesterday  
And baby you know my hands are dirty  
But I wanted to be your Valentine  
I'll be the water when you get thirsty baby  
When you get drunk, I'll be the wine  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you  
Words can't say what love can do  
I'll be there for you  
  
I wasn't there when you were happy  
And I wasn't there when you were down  
Didn't mean to miss your birthday baby  
I wish I'd seen you blow those candles out  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you  
When you breathe I want to be the air for you  
I'll be there for you  
I'd live and I'd die for you  
I'd steal the sun from the sky for you  
Words can't say what love can do  
I'll be there for  
  
I'll be there for you, these five words I swear to you

Angels falling from the sky  
Imagine that imagine that  
Nobody's getting out of here alive  
No turning back no turning back  
Who's going to bail out all our shattered dreams?  
And scrape some truth off of these city streets  
No time for praying get up off your knees  
  
[Chorus]  
There's hope I know  
Out on that lonely road  
'Cause home is where you are and where I am  
Breathe in, breathe out  
There's only now  
And all I got I'm holding in my hands  
We're breaking out of brokenpromiseland  
  
Let's close our eyes and just disappear  
Slip through the cracks no looking back  
We'll get a million miles away from here  
And let the past just fade to black  
So what you learn to live with your regrets  
No need to fear what hasn't happened yet  
Life will get you but you can't forget  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So rise my fallen angel  
Come on now come on now  
Shine, don't let 'em break you  
Come on now, come on now  
Come on now, come on now  
  
Come on now, come on now  
Come on now, come on  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(La la la la la la la la) breaking out of brokenpromiseland  
(La la la la la la la la) breaking out of brokenpromiseland  
(La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)  
(La la la la la la la la, la la la la la la la la)  
(Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh)

I've been lied to, you been cheated  
I've been cried to, you been mistreated  
I've been watching you, you want action  
You need love and I need satisfaction  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm burning for love  
Filled with desire  
I can't stand the heat  
My heart's on fire  
I can't get enough  
It's down to the wire  
Making my move, I'm looking for you  
I'm burning for love  
  
You're the victim it's in your eyes  
I'm the suspect and love's the crime  
Tensions mounting bodies shaking  
I can't take the anticipation  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now that I got you in my sight  
Can't take another sleepless night  
Oh, no, no  
You can run but you can't hide  
You're the only one I need  
To feel the fire inside  
  
[Chorus]

Wise men say only fools rush in  
but I can't help falling in love with you  
Shall I stay  
would it be a sin  
If I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
some things are meant to be  
take my hand, take my whole life too  
  
for I can't help falling in love with you  
  
Like a river flows surely to the sea  
Darling so it goes  
some things are meant to be  
take my hand, take my whole life too  
for I can't help falling in love with you  
for I can't help falling in love with you

Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star,  
And everybody's in movies, it doesn't matter who you are.  
There are stars in every city,  
In every house and on every street,  
And if you walk down hollywood boulevard  
Their names are written in concrete!  
  
Don't step on greta garbo as you walk down the boulevard,  
She looks so weak and fragile that's why she tried to be so hard  
But they turned her into a princess  
And they sat her on a throne,  
But she turned her back on stardom,  
Because she wanted to be alone.  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down hollywood boulevard,  
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.  
Rudolph valentino, looks very much alive,  
And he looks up ladies' dresses as they sadly pass him by.  
Avoid stepping on bela lugosi  
'cos he's liable to turn and bite,  
But stand close by bette davis  
Because hers was such a lonely life.  
If you covered him with garbage,  
George sanders would still have style,  
And if you stamped on mickey rooney  
He would still turn round and smile,  
But please don't tread on dearest marilyn  
'cos she's not very tough,  
She should have been made of iron or steel,  
But she was only made of flesh and blood.  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk down hollywood boulevard,  
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of.  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.  
  
Everybody's a dreamer and everybody's a star  
And everybody's in show biz, it doesn't matter who you are.  
  
And those who are successful,  
Be always on your guard,  
Success walks hand in hand with failure  
Along hollywood boulevard.  
  
I wish my life was a non-stop hollywood movie show,  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die.  
  
You can see all the stars as you walk along hollywood boulevard,  
Some that you recognise, some that you've hardly even heard of,  
People who worked and suffered and struggled for fame,  
Some who succeeded and some who suffered in vain.  
  
Oh celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
Oh celluloid heroes never really die.  
  
I wish my life was a non-stop hollywood movie show,  
A fantasy world of celluloid villains and heroes,  
Because celluloid heroes never feel any pain  
And celluloid heroes never really die.

Are. Sambora  
  
Hey, whats this feeling  
I've never been down this far before  
I was scared of believing  
That love would never find my door  
I was chained  
Chained  
Chained to my broken dreams  
I never knew I was supposed to be  
Waiting for someone to come and rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me.  
Hey am I dreaming?  
I never woke up from night before  
Unaware I was bleeding  
Slowly dying like the sun  
Going down once more.  
I was chained  
Chained  
Chained to my broken dreams  
I never knew just where my life would lead  
Hoping that someone would come and rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me.  
Alone in the darkness  
Til saw the light  
Shining from your eyes  
Now it burns inside and it keeps me alive  
Lord I've been chained  
I've been chained, yeah.  
Was chained  
Chained  
Chained to these broken dreams  
I never knew who supposed to be  
Hoping that someone would come and rescue me  
I've been chained  
Chained  
I've been chained to these broken dreams  
I never knew just where my life would lead  
Waiting for you to come and rescue me  
Hoping that someone would come and  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Rescue me  
Ooh yeah  
Rescue me

J. Bon jovi  
  
You said you loved to watch me sleep  
You put your head down on my chest  
To hear my breath  
  
Go on, take my last breath from me  
I don't want to live no more  
And cut my eyes so I can't see  
I can't see you looking back as you walk out the door  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
I was a lover lost in sea  
You found me washed up on the beach  
You took me home, you gave me breakfast  
I said Id offer you protection, but you didn't charge a fee  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
Cold, cold heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
  
What are you hiding underneath that shirt  
If youre the one to run babe  
Then you don't feel the hurt  
  
Her hair so brown, and eyes so green  
You used to say I made good company  
Shed bring me wine and sip her tea  
Then youd give yourself what you could give to me  
  
Chorus:  
Cold, hard heart  
Cold, cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
Cold, cold heart  
Your cruel heart  
Whats it gonna take  
To break your cold, hard heart  
Whats it gonna take

The city sounds like a symphony  
A cabbie screams obscenities  
The horns are honking jazz in the night  
The street is lit like a Christmas tree  
This place its my amphetamine  
She junks me but its alright  
In her summer dress she parts the sea  
Her hair wrapped up in rosary beads  
Everybody else is gone but her and me  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
Sittin' on my stoop I lit one up  
Hit the ashes in my coffee cup  
And watch the world passin' me by  
Throw a coat of paint on this rusty heart  
Ain't it funny how life imitates art?  
Saint Valentine he's got bloody knees tonight  
  
But when she's walkin' down the street  
The sidewalks there to kiss her feet  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
  
She needs me, pleads me  
And wraps me in her loving charm  
She'll tease me, squeeze me  
But I'm the man when I'm in her arms  
  
Now the angels sing a melody  
They wrote for her explicitly  
And no one hears but her and me  
  
Now wait a minute  
Wait, I can't believe my eyes  
Who's that comin' round the corner?  
Oh she's lookin' fine ain't she?  
Get out the way!  
No, no, no, no, no get out the way!  
Oh look at those high heel sneakers  
  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again,  
That crazy thing called love  
Here it comes  
That crazy love  
Here she comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes  
Its crazy love  
Here it comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here it comes  
That crazy love  
Here she comes again  
That crazy thing called love  
Here she comes

Lyin' here beside you in someone else's bed  
Knowin' what we're doin's wrong but better left unsaid  
Your breathin' sounds like screamin'  
It's all that I can stand  
His ring is on your finger but my heart is in your hands  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
Damned  
Damned  
  
The door slams like a shotgun  
You jump up to your feet  
But it's just the wind that's blowin' through those secrets that we keep  
Made me want to want you  
God knows I need to need you  
By the time this love is over I'll be sleepin' on the street  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
  
Why won't you talk to me?  
Because I'm too blind to see  
Why won't you look at me?  
Because I'm afraid to breathe  
What do you want from me?  
All that I can stand  
The lies are on my tongue and I can't go back  
I know my soul is damned  
  
Don't worry  
I ain't gonna call you or hear you say my name  
But if you see me on the streets  
Don't wave  
Just walk away  
Our lives are gettin' twisted  
Let's keep our stories straight  
The more that I resist it my temptation turns to fate  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
Damned  
Yeah I'm Damned  
  
Damned if you love me  
Damned if you don't  
It's gettin' harder holdin' on but I can't let you go  
Damned if you don't need me  
Damned if you do  
Oh God I wish it wasn't me standin' in these shoes  
Damned  
I'm Damned

I've been waitin' for this scene to end  
I don't need somebody baby, I need a friend  
I work all day just like doin' time  
I've stood tall through the fires of hell  
And I've walked through enemy lines.  
  
So now you've gone and built a wall around you  
Its gonna take a heart to knock it down too.  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, and it's bringing me down, it's bringing me down  
  
If I could be the hero in your masquerade,  
I could sweep you off your feet and take you far away.  
There ain't no saviors in the real world,  
There's only broken hearts and souls for you and me girl.  
  
Now you've gone and built a wall around you  
It's gonna take a heart to knock it down too.  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, well it's bringing me down  
  
So load your guns and fire away,  
All it takes is one fair shot to blow your world away.  
  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, when you're without love  
Deep cuts the night, and it's bringin' me down, it's bringin' me down

J. Bon jovi  
  
Hey babe, its me parked outside your house  
I know that hes asleep, so listen to me now  
Darlin, I'm tired of living just in your dreams  
I'm getting out  
You know we both sold our souls  
Were just growing old, in this sleepy, dead-end town  
  
Destination anywhere  
Name the place and Ill be there  
Pack a bag a were out of here - lets run  
  
Baby, we both been running uphill for too long  
We both settled for something, got nothing  
And we both know its wrong  
Go on admit it we lived it, I'm leaving -  
Get your boots and come on  
I got my coat and my keys, I need you next to me, then I'm gone  
  
Destination anywhere  
Name the place and Ill be there  
Pack a bag a were out of here - lets run  
Destination anywhere  
Left of right, I don't care  
Maybe well just disappear like the sun  
  
When these wheels spin, they can all eat our dust  
As far as I'm concerned, this whole towns lost  
Its nuts  
We wont be here when they put us down  
Its our big chance and I'm calling you now  
Theyll never let us go unless we try  
I'm tired of living just to die  
Were getting out of here, destination anywhere  
  
Destination anywhere  
Name the place and Ill be there  
Pack a bag a were out of here - lets run  
Destination anywhere  
Left of right, I don't care  
Maybe well just disappear like the sun, come on, come on, come on

You know he can't be tested.  
He can't be read or found.  
Urban gray takes breath away.  
He wants to push his pedal to the ground.  
And the nights whats right.  
Puts him at the wheel.  
Well, I eat danger.  
Any stranger is all right.  
Feel hot to go like jimmy O.  
Dodging flying objects at the show.  
And the lights make me fight.  
In detroit 442...  
Maybe, baby, I could ride with you.  
This towns a concrete factory and dad and mom look just like me.  
I'm on the plant assembly line.  
Too late now.  
Too far behind!  
You said you wanna hang around.  
No one really cares where you go.  
Take your time.  
Things never change.  
In detroit 442 maybe baby I could ride with you.  
One more to market, one more piggie, and they all, they all look just like me,
yeah.

Diamond ring, wear it on your hand  
It's gonna tell the world, I'm your only man  
Diamond ring, diamond ring  
Baby, you're my everything, diamond ring  
  
Red, red rose brought it home to you  
Blood red rose, tells me that you're true  
Red, red rose, blood-red rose  
Like a fire inside that grows, blood-red rose  
  
When you're hungry, I will fill you up  
When you're thristy, drink out of my loving cup  
When you're crying, I'll be the tears for you  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you  
  
When you're hungry, I will fill you up  
When you're thristy, drink out of my loving cup  
When you're crying, I'll be the tears for you  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do for you  
  
You know, I bleed every night you sleep  
'Cause I don't know if I'm in your dreams  
I want to be your everything...  
  
Diamond ring, wear it on your hand  
It's gonna tell the world, I'm your only man  
Diamond ring, diamond ring  
Baby, you're my everything, diamond ring  
Darling, you're my everything, diamond ring  
Now, you've got me on your string... Diamond ring  

If I've told you once, I've told you a thousand times  
You can't go on playing with people's minds  
But you lied thinking that you'd get by  
Breaking hearts one by one in a line  
Cause you're driving me crazy  
I just can't go on making love to a woman  
Who's been playing with me all along  
So don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
I can count the times you really made me a fool  
I guess what we've got was a different set of rules  
Well you cried, thinking that I'd breakdown  
But I'm not sure I need you hanging around  
Cause you're driving me crazy  
I just can't go on making love to a woman  
Who's been playing with me all along  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
You wont have me to kick around anymore  
I'm not a fool for you and that's for sure  
No reason left for you to try to pretend  
I told you before now I'll say it again  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore  
Don't do that to me anymore

When I come home, it's late, I feel so all alone  
What was my mistake, baby, why don't you care at all?  
Well if it's just a change in you, I'll adjust,  
But if you're true give me a sign of your trust,  
And am I supposed to be true to you.  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', if you've given up  
  
When I come to bed, you're there, but I feel so all alone  
What can I do, short of sleepin' on the floor  
I might be slow girl but I'm not dumb  
The question arises, am I the only one?  
And am I supposed to be in love with you  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', have you given up  
Don't you keep me baby  
  
I might be slow girl, I'm not dumb  
The question arises, am I the only one?  
And am I supposed to be in love with you  
  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', have you given up  
Don't keep me wonderin', do I still have your love  
Don't keep me wonderin', have you given up  
Don't you give up baby

If I had to I would lie for you,  
And baby I would cry, I'd cry for you.  
If I have to, I'll get down on my knees for you.  
  
Tommy's home and waiting up for you,  
And it you leave, he'll make you black and blue.  
Please don't go, not this time,  
Oh no don't leave me tonight.  
  
Don't leave me tonight, don't leave me tonight,  
Don't leave me tonight, oh no no.  
  
If you only knew what you put me through,  
And how many night I've waited up for you.  
Thinkin' about you baby every night,  
Now you're here and you've gotta go home.  
  
We can hide out and rendezvous,  
Just me and just you.  
So please baby please, don't put up a fight,  
Oh no don't leave me tonight.  
  
Don't leave me tonight, don't leave me tonight,  
Don't leave me tonight, oh no no.  
  
Don't leave me tonight (oh baby not tonight)  
Don't leave me tonight (I can't take it this time)  
Don't leave me tonight (Oh no no no)  
  
He don't love you half as much as I do,  
Promise you'll stay the night, and love me too.  
Yeah yeah yeah.  
  
I can't stand another night alone,  
Or talkin' to you on the phone.  
So tell 'em that we're runnin' away,  
Tell 'em anything you want.  
Please stay now, don't say you'll go.  
  
Don't leave me tonight,  
Everything's gonna be alright.  
I need you girl, I need you to stay,  
Don't turn your back and walk away.  
  
Don't leave me tonight, don't leave me tonight,  
Don't leave me tonight, oh no no.  
  
Don't leave me tonight (everything will be alright)  
Don't leave me tonight (I can tell you I love you)  
Don't leave me tonight (I'm goin' outa my mind I  
Can't stand the nights alone).  
  
Don't leave me tonight (So baby don't say you're goin')  
Don't leave me tonight (Oh baby stay around)  
Don't leave me tonight (I can't take it, can't take it,  
Can't take it, can't  
Take it without you, so baby please hang on).

I know it's been a long time, since I called you last  
Remember all those dreams that we had, the time went by so damn fast  
You said I had to flaunt those girls I kept by my sides for kicks  
You let the rumors fly, it's nothing new  
What those little boys will do to get their fix  
  
You broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Since you left me baby, since you gone and stole my heart  
I remember the very night that I broke down and fell apart  
Girl you don't remember, what I'm up here to be  
Baby, baby don't you know, you're the biggest part of me  
  
It broke my heart when you said good bye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Broke my heart when you said goodbye, bye, bye  
You believed him when he told you a lie  
Without your love baby I'm gonna die  
  
Don't you believe him (don't you believe him)  
He's gonna fill you up with lies  
Don't you believe him darling, (don't you believe him)  
He's gone too far this time  
  
Don't you believe him, don't you believe him  
Don't you believe him, don't you believe him

Day after day I get more confused  
Trying to see the light  
In the morning rain  
Going on a game  
You have to lose  
'Cause the feeling's changed  
I won't lose again  
  
CHORUS 1  
Giving the people  
As I pray my soul  
I wanna get lost in rock'n'roll  
And drift away  
  
Sometimes I think  
I've always been down  
I don't understand the things I see  
The world outside seems so unkind  
So unkind  
But I'm dependin' on you to let it  
See me through  
  
REPEAT CHORUS 1

Baby, I've been thinking, it's too hard to speak these nights,  
Can I confess what's on my chest, what's really on my mind.  
See, I never was scared of nothing, there was nothing that we couldn't do,  
We used to think that we could walk on water, just because we wanted to.  
And it all seemed so easy, when we were living not just alive,  
We talked about dreams, and how we would like to spend our lives.  
  
When freedom was a tank of gas, on a long summer night,  
To drive, just drive.  
  
Can you keep a secret baby, if you can't, just lie,  
Yeah, I want to scream, when I have this dream, that my whole life passed me  
By.  
And they sold my heart for diamonds, and they sold some pride for gold,  
There's lots of things that I can't get back, that the record company owns.  
When 17 has turned 30, it's all gone kiss it goodbye.  
Hey baby, maybe we aint kids no more, but I'm too young to die.  
  
There's still some freedom in this tank of gas, if you're by my side,  
We'll drive, just drive.  
  
Don't want no airplanes, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, with you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board.  
We'll drive, with the radio on.  
  
You can lean your head on my shoulder, and just for a while,  
Forget about the world, baby, mile after mile.  
We'll drive, all night long yeah, you want a ride?  
  
No airplane, no ticket on a fast train,  
All I wanted was a two-lane, and you by my side.  
We'll drive, all night long, get on board,  
We'll drive, with the radio on baby all right.

Across the border they turn water into wine  
Some say it's the devil's blood  
They're squeezing from the vine  
Some say it's a savior  
In these hard and desperate times  
You see it helps me to forget that we're just born  
To die  
  
I came here like so many did to find a better life  
To find my piece of easy street  
To finally be alive  
And I know nothing good comes easy  
All good things take some time  
I made my bed I'll lie in it  
To die in it's the crime  
  
You can't help but prosper  
Where the streets are paved with gold  
They say the oil wells ran deeper here than anybody's known  
Now I packed up on my wife and kid  
And left them both back at home  
See there's nothing in this pay dirt  
The ghosts are all I know  
  
Now the oil's gone  
And the money's gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still we're hangin' on  
  
Down in dry county  
They're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no one's getting out of here alive (Not this time)  
  
"In the blessed name of Jesus" I heard a preacher say  
That we are all God's children  
And He'd be back, back someday  
I hoped that he knew something as he drank that cup of wine  
I didn't have too good a feeling as I head out to the night  
  
I cursed the sky to open  
I begged the clouds for rain  
I prayed all night for water  
For this burning in my veins  
It was like my soul's on fire  
And I had to watch the flames  
All my dreams went up in ashes  
And my future blew away  
  
Now the oil's gone  
And the money's gone  
All the jobs are gone  
Still we're hangin' on  
  
Down in dry county  
They're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash these sins from off our hands  
Here in dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
And no one's getting out of here alive  
  
Men spend their whole lives waiting  
Prayin' for some big reward  
But it seems sometimes the payoff  
Leaves you feeling like a dirty whore  
If I could choose the way I'd die  
Make it by the gun or knife  
'Cause the other way there's too much pain  
Night after night after night after night  
  
Down in dry county  
Where they're swimming in the sand  
Praying for some holy water  
To wash the sins from off our hands  
In dry county  
The promise has run dry  
Where nobody cries  
No one's getting out of here  
Dry county  
And no one's getting out of here  
Dry county

A whiskey bottle comforts me  
And tells me not to cry  
While a full moon says a prayer for me  
I try to close my eyes  
  
But the night's there to remind me  
Of the guns and the early graves  
The ghosts appear as I fall asleep  
To sing an outlaw's serenade  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
  
The desert's been a friend to me  
It covers me by night  
And a snakebite's not my enemy  
But it taught me how to fight  
  
All this fame don't bring you freedom  
Though it wears a this disguise  
When an outlaw is just a man to me  
And a man has to die  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
  
And I hope someone will pray for me  
When it's my turn to die, pray for me  
  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin'  
When you're livin' on the run  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young  
Is it too late to ask for forgiveness  
For the things that I have done  
Dyin' ain't much of a livin' for the young

And there I stood, just like a soldier  
I was tough, until I saw her  
I said hello, but she just turned away  
  
Hey romeo, whatcha doin with my girl,  
Who are you using now, well I turn and walk away (turn and walk away)  
  
Im gonna please her, now you can believe it  
Ill be there to catch her when she falls  
  
Oooo, here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im a man (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Here we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)  
So run if you can cause you know  
Im a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
  
Im on the outside, looking inside  
Youre with him, whos on the wrong side now  
Do you still think of me  
  
Ive tried to call, but no one answers  
Two silhouettes, a private dancer  
Lights go dim, as the music starts to fade, away (turn and walk away)  
  
Im the one who needs you, now you can believe it  
Ill be there to catch you when you fall  
  
Ooo you better believe Im the man (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Here I am (on the edge of a broken heart)  
And we stand (on the edge of a broken heart)  
So run if you can cause you know

Solo  
  
Ooohh  
And when I hold out my hands Ill be reaching for you  
I give it all that Ive got, thats all I can do  
When youre waiting for love  
Ill be waiting for you (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Only for you (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Oh baby for you (on the edge of a broken heart)  
So run if you can, you know  
Im a man on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (on the edge of a broken heart)  
Im on the edge (of a broken, broken, broken broken, broken, broken, broken)

As a hard rain beats down in the night  
It sounds like applause  
Still I can't hear a sound  
With the beat of my heart  
  
I can't pick up that phone anymore  
And I need to confess  
If I don't say, "I love you"  
Everything else is a waste of my breathe  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
To live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
As I whisper your name  
I wish you were here by my side  
And the only way that I find you  
Is when I close my eyes  
  
With my ring on your finger  
I hope and I pray  
That you know deep in your soul  
With every step that you take  
  
Every beat of my heart I would give  
Every beat of my heart just to live  
I live for your love, if all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
It's the little things that you do  
That make me want you more  
It's the way your hands are trembling  
But what they trembling for?  
  
It's the way the smile fits on your lips  
The way you hold me tight  
God knows I'd give everything  
To be in your arms tonight  
  
I live for your love, it's all that I want  
Is to die in your arms  
I'd give every beat of my heart just to live  
Every beat of my heart, just to live  
I live for your love, it's all that I want  
To die in your arms  
I'd give you every beat of my heart  
  
Give you every beat of my heart  
Give you every beat of my heart  
Give you every beat of my heart

I've got your picture on my phone,  
Your voice in my head,  
I'm lying here alone,  
Restless in a far away bed,  
The stars are falling down  
And I'm half the world away,  
I'm just trying to close the distance,  
To feel each breath that you take,  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,  
Like a wild arrow flying  
And I'm blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew  
And every road leads home to you,  
Home to you,  
  
So you got me to believe,  
Made me turn on a dime,  
The writing on the wall  
Right in front of me  
Every song, every rhyme,  
  
But I don't need a thousand words,  
I need you safe in my arms,  
I'll be standing strong,  
I'll keep holding on  
When life tries tearing us apart,  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,  
Like a wild arrow flying  
Now I'm blindly running  
From everything I thought I knew,  
  
No I ain't regretting  
Just how lost I'm getting  
Or the red lights I've been blowing through,  
My foot will find the pedal  
As I'm counting the lines,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Every road leads home to you,  
  
Home,  
The road still leads me home to you,  
Sometimes I don't see the signs,  
The headlights make me blind,  
The road still leads me home to you,  
  
[Solo]  
  
When the bridge is burning  
And I'm losing my faith  
And I'm trying to find my way towards the truth,  
Like the wild arrow flying  
Now I'm blindly running from  
Everything I thought I knew,  
  
No I ain't regretting  
Just how lost I'm getting  
Or the red lights I've been blowing through,  
My foot will find the pedal  
As I'm counting the lines,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Home to you,  
Home to you,  
Home to you,  
Every road leads home to you,  
Home to you,  
Every road  
Leads home to you  
  
Every road leads home to you.

J. Bon jovi  
  
I've been staring at the page  
For what seems like days  
I guess I put this one off for a while  
Did I see a tear fall from your eyes  
Or did you laugh so hard that you cried  
When I served my secrets on a silver tray to you  
Hey now, I guess the nights just bringing me down  
  
Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But, know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Youve been the blood in my veins  
The only one who knows my middle name  
And the smiles they came easy cause of you  
You know that I love you, but I hate you  
Cause I know I can never escape you  
Let the choir sing for tonight I'm an easy mark  
Hey now, am I acting just a little too proud  
  
Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Have I said too much  
Maybe I haven't said enough  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
  
Hush me darling, maybe I've lost my touch  
Maybe I've lost my guts - there, is that truth enough  
Hey now, hey now  
  
You know these love letters mix with whisky  
Just don't light a match when you kiss me  
Though Ill blow away, you know Ill be back soon  
Hey now, hey now, hey now, am I talking just a little too loud  
  
Theres not love, theres no hate  
I left them there for you to take  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Have I said too much  
Maybe I haven't said enough  
But know that every word was a piece of my heart  
Hey now, am I talking just a little too proud  
Hey now, the nights just bringing me down

I used to be the kind of guy  
Who'd never let you look inside  
I'd smile when I was crying  
I had nothing but a life to loose  
Thought I had a lot to proof  
In my life, there's no denying  
  
Goodbye to all my yesterdays  
Goodbye, so long, I'm on my way  
  
I've had enough of cryin'  
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'  
Hear me when I say  
Gonna live my life everyday  
I'm gonna touch the sky  
And I spread these wings and fly  
I ain't here to play  
I'm gonna live my life everyday  
  
Strange, everybody's feeling strange  
Never gonna be the same  
Makes you wonder how the world keeps turning  
Life, learning how to live my life  
Learning how to pick my fights  
Take my shots while I'm still burning  
  
Goodbye to all those rainy nights  
Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on  
  
I've had enough of cryin'  
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'  
Hear me when I say  
Gonna live my life everyday  
I'm gonna touch the sky  
And I spread these wings and fly  
I ain't here to play  
I'm gonna live my life everyday  
  
There ain't nothing gonna get in my way  
Everyday  
  
Goodbye, so long, I'm moving on  
  
I've had enough of cryin'  
Bleedin', sweatin', dyin'  
Hear me when I say  
Gonna live my life everyday  
I'm gonna touch the sky  
And I spread these wings and fly  
I ain't here to play  
I'm gonna live my life everyday  
  
I, oh I, oh I, I'm gonna live my life everyday  
I (gonna touch the sky), oh I (spread these wings and fly), oh I  
I'm gonna live my life everyday

R.sambora  
  
Theres a line that you cross  
When you find out that youre lost  
When your world is closing in  
And it crawls under your skin  
And the hearts always blind  
When its in this state of mind  
Theres a burning light in this town  
For every heart thats broken down tonight  
Here tonight  
Youre stranded out there in the rain  
And you just cant see past the pain tonight  
Youve fallen from graceland  
Fallen from graceland  
When youre too proud to crawl  
It keeps you back against the wall  
You wanna die, but you live  
With nothing left to give  
And theres no place to hide  
When youre tangled up inside  
Theres a burning light in this town  
For every heart thats broken down tonight  
Here tonight  
Youre stranded out there in the rain  
But you just cant see past the pain tonight  
Youve fallen from graceland  
And theres no place to hide  
When youre tangled up inside  
Theres a burning light in this town  
For every heart thats broken down tonight  
Here tonight  
Youve stranded out there in the rain  
But you just cant see past the pain tonight  
Youve fallen from graceland  
Fallen youve fallen from graceland tonight  
Fallen, fallen, fallen, fallen from graceland  
And tonight  
Theres a light  
A bright light burning  
For every broken heart in this world tonight  
Deep inside  
Yes, theres one light burning  
That will lead you throught the storm tonight  
Its gonna be alright  
Be alright, yeah  
Gonna be alright, yeah  
Its gonna be alright  
(oh, its gonna be alright, tonight)

(sambora, child)  
  
Father time  
I couldn't make her wanna stay  
I couldn't seem to find the words to say  
Now I have to live in yesterday  
Father time  
  
I thought that you were on my side  
I thought that I could keep our love alive  
I thought that I could keep her satisfied  
  
The clock keeps tickin and I keep on thinkin bout you  
I'm knockin at the door of your heart but I can't break through  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Don't tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
  
Now shes gone  
She didn't even say goodbye  
I guess she didn't have the heart to try  
She didn't even have the guts to lie  
Father time  
Only you can turn the page  
And close the curtain on this empty stage  
Only you can take my pain away  
  
My heart keeps breakin and my body keeps aching for you  
Its time to hold on but theres nothin left to hold on to  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Don't tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
  
Father, father can't you see I'm depending on you  
I'm dying at the door to your heart and I can't break through  
  
Father time  
Grant me just another day  
Of our love I tried to make her stay  
Father time  
Don't tell me its too late  
All my life you know that I would wait  
Father time  
Shes your child make her mine  
Father time

I see you looking over your shoulder  
Tell me who do you think's out there  
You're reaching for your four leaf clover  
But baby there ain't no luck down there  
I swear that there's no heart in this city  
It's here the slogan reads  
"Do your time" everybody's doing  
their sentence  
It's just there ain't nobody here  
Who knows just what's the crime  
I watched my father live a lie here  
I'd rather die than fade away  
I read the rules  
And yeah I know them  
Still you ain't ever gonna  
Make me play the game of  
Fear  
Fear  
Fear  
Fear  
  
Running with the rats  
Through the city  
Makes you feel like you're  
A partner in crime  
Girl once you won't stop to watch  
That little girl did  
  
Hey baby won't you stop and hear me  
Just being here we're  
breathing heart attacks  
We can run and chase  
The setting sun we can run  
And we won't ever look back  
  
Take my hand I know we'll make it  
I'll let nothing slow us down  
I know you want to curse  
This place but there's only  
One thing that's stopping us now  
  
Fear fear fear  
Of a new thing  
Fear fear fear  
Of the brass ring  
  
You ain't one for taking chances  
You work and live and breathe that 9 to 5  
Still that's what you call living  
That's surviving to me  
  
And surviving is living to die in  
Fear

Baby When I think about you I think about love  
Darlin' Gonna live without you And your love  
If I had those golden dreams of my yesterday  
I would wrap you In the Heavens  
And feel it dying dying dying all the way  
  
Feel like makin' Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love Feel like makin' love  
I feel like makin' love to you  
  
Baby If I think about you I think about love  
Darlin' If I had to live without you I live without love  
And if I had the sun and moon We will shine them  
I would give you both night and day - Love satisfying  
  
Feel like makin' Feel like makin' love  
Feel like makin' love Feel like makin' love  
I feel like makin' love to you  
  
And if I had those golden dreams of my yesterday  
I would wrap you In the Heavens  
Feel it dying dying dying all the way

There's no-one watching over me tonight and I'm afraid to turn out the lights,  
If I close my eyes, it'll all go away and I don't wanna see it end this way.  
  
There was a time when truth and trust meant so much more to each of us  
And all the dreams that once we had have seen the sun and left us feeling bad  
  
Now the changing of the guard has left us feeling so damn hard  
I'll keep my business, but I'm a little bit afraid  
Through the years one thing hasn't changed  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass,  
Just to swin in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
That's all I ask  
  
Now feeling good is not good enough, I know they've changed but not that much  
Midnight time has left us feeling beaten up, I never was one who needs to give
enough  
I ain't a hero who gets the girl, but if I had my chance to save the world  
I won't blow it now, I guess I'll understand  
This boy becoming a man  
  
Yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass,  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
That's all I ask  
  
Well, look at your hands if you hear what I said.  
Can you count on your fingers each of your real friends  
I know that I'm lucky, I know I'm right.  
Fingerst turn into fists, we're here to take on the night.  
That's right  
  
Now I'm staring at an open door, we've had a lot and I want much more  
You can keep all the money, and the streets that's painted gold  
If someone gives me back my soul  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah-hey  
  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would crawl on broken glass  
Just to swim in your sea of devotion, just to have a second chance  
I would run through fields of fire,  
I would run through fields of fire  
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I would run  
All the way back home, I would run,  
Baby come along

They judge you by your money  
Or the color of your skin  
They read you by the cover  
Don't take time to read within  
  
They judge you without jury  
And you struggle to believe  
No one could hear your story  
Even justice had to leave  
All I know  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
They build the walls around you  
They tell you, you don't fit  
Still you think you know me  
You don't know the half of it  
  
I'm a beggar, you're a savior  
I'm your devil, you're a thief  
I'll be here until you realize  
I'm you and you are me  
  
All that I know  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
Do the cuts bleed any different  
On a pauper or a king?  
When it comes down to dyin'  
The crown don't mean a thing, no, no, no, no  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
  
All we are is all alone  
(Man is made of flesh and bone)  
Man is made of flesh and bone

You need someone to make it last  
No Romeos who'll love and leave you fast  
They fade away  
Tonight you're not gonna be alone  
Making love on the telephone  
Baby, baby if you can hold on  
I'm gonna take you all the way tonight  
I like 'em down and dirty, hold on tight  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on get ready  
Come on get ready  
  
You're looking sharp in your dancing shoes  
You got the style and you got the moves  
Oh you're so hot, girl and on the loose  
You're caught up in a danger zone  
Just seventeen but you act full grown  
The nightlife is turning you on  
You want to take me all the way tonight  
Take my hand, you can feel the heat  
Make you feel alright  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on  
Come on

You say you don't like my kind  
A bitter picture in your mind  
No, it don't matter what I say  
I hear you bitchin' when I walk away  
I'll never be what you want me to be  
You tell me I'm wrong but I disagree  
I ain't go no apology  
Just because I don't look like you, talk like you, think like you  
Judge and jury, a hangman's noose  
I see them in your eyes  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
You judge a man who don't stand in line  
Just because he ain't on your side  
You know the man who wears those shoes  
If you cut me don't I bleed like you? (You know I do)  
  
I don't know what you've been told  
Can't buy guts with a pot o' gold  
A rich man's poor if he got no soul  
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, king  
All that shit don't mean a thing  
Do you know which one's behind those eyes?  
It's all a disguise  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
Hey baby, whose side you on?  
You think you got it all figured out where we belong  
Forget all about your dark from light  
Day from night  
Wrong from right  
  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Good guys don't always wear white  
  
Tell your Mama, baby  
Good guys don't always wear white  
Don't always wear, don't always wear  
Don't always wear, don't always wear  
Don't always wear, don't always wear  
White

Here we stand, caught between the cradle and the grave  
In a world that gives you nothing but your name  
With every step you take, you must be brave  
Nothing lost is nothing gained  
  
And I know lives are lost for crowns and kings  
We all know love is lost for lesser things  
And the angels here have broken wings  
Though I know somewhere a choir sings  
  
You gotta have a reason  
A reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
A reason to believe  
  
A hot-headed hero, here you see I'm just a man  
Comes a time, a time to make a stand, yeah  
So here I am with heart in hand  
Don't be afraid to understand  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
Sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
A reason to believe in trust  
  
I believe in faith  
I believe in us  
'Til my dying day  
You gotta have a reason  
Whoa, you gotta have a reason, yeah  
  
If all we've got is you and me  
Then what we've got is all we need  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
One reason  
  
You gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream  
But sometimes it takes blind eyes to see  
One reason  
  
You gotta have a reason  
Whoa, you gotta have a reason  
One reason to believe  
A reason just to dream, yeah

Well, I heard there was a secret chord  
That David played to please the Lord  
But you don't really care for music, do you?  
  
Well, it goes like this the fourth, the fifth  
The minor fall and the major lift  
The baffled king composing Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, your faith was strong but you needed proof  
You saw her bathing on the roof  
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you  
  
And she tied you to her kitchen chair  
She broke your throne and she cut your hair  
And from the lips she drew the Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Yeah, baby, I've been here before  
I've seen this room and I've walked this floor  
I used to live alone before I knew you  
  
And I've seen your flag on that marble arch  
Your love is not a victory march  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, there was a time when you let me know  
What was going on below  
Now you don't never show that to me, do you?  
  
But remember when I moved in you  
And the holy dove was moving too  
And every breath we drew was Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
  
Well, now maybe there's a God above  
But all I've ever learned from love  
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you  
  
And it's not your cry that I hear at night, no  
It's not someone who's seen the light  
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah  
  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah, Hallelujah  
Hallelujah

Are. Sambora  
  
Its amazing  
We go through changes  
When times get crazy  
Its up and down, its hot and cold  
These complications  
Just keep on coming  
These aint no running  
When it comes to life that's how it goes  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby don't you know  
It could eat up  
If you try and keep it all inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
Theres gonna be thunder  
Theres gonna be rain  
Theres gonna be those times  
We both get caught up in the pain  
The realization  
Keeps sinkin in  
The way you make it  
Is learn to take it on the chin  
Round and round we go  
Its just another day  
With trouble knockin at your door  
Baby don't you know  
We can work it out  
Cause we always seem to find a cure  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Even if it hurts  
Even if it hurts us baby  
  
Round and round we go  
Sometimes it feels like  
Were on a roller coaster ride  
Baby don't you know  
Well keep holdin on  
Through the changes that we feel inside  
Seems like hard times come easy  
We do a lot of hangin on these days  
But the heart finds a reason  
And love always seems to find a way  
Hard times come easy babe

Are. Sambora  
  
The old man down on the corner  
Is downing in his pain  
I can see the sorrow in his eyes  
His tears, the leave a stain  
The streets have left him broken  
Hes in the final phase  
Its been a long hard road  
From his glory days.  
Theres a tatoo of his sweetheart  
Fading on his arm  
He talks of painful tragedy  
How he lost his lucky charm  
His memory is clouded  
From the thunder in this vein  
Hes vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain.  
On desperation avenue  
The devil takes his toll  
Where the pushers and the poverty  
Slowly claim your soul  
When you reached the realization  
That you just can't break the chain, no  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.  
Harlem rain coming down  
Another shattered soul  
In the lost and found  
One more night  
On the street of pain  
Getting washed away by the harlem rain (harlem rain).  
In your seach for tender mercy  
No one seemed to care  
The faith that used to be your crutch  
Is now your cross to bear  
You last yourself so long ago  
You don't know who to blame  
Youre vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
Vanishing, vanishing gone  
In the harlem rain.

When the road gets dark  
And you can no longer see  
Let my love throw a spark  
Have a little faith in me  
  
And when the tears you cry  
Are all you can believe  
Give these loving arms a try baby  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
When your secret heart  
Cannot speak so easily  
From a whisper start  
To have a little faith in me  
  
And when your back's against the wall  
Just turn around and you will see  
I will catch your fall  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Solo  
  
When the road gets dark  
And you can no longer see  
Let my love throw a spark  
Have a little faith in me  
  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
Have a little faith in me  
  
I've been loving you for such a long time  
Expecting nothing in return  
Just for you to have a little faith in me  
You know time, time is our friend  
I will hold you up, I will hold you up  
Your love gives me strength enough  
  
Have a little faith in me

I've been hell raised on leather  
High heel, studded, black, cool boots  
Had anything any man could have wanted  
All I ever wanted was you  
  
And baby I've done whatever I wanted  
I stole the lights and I've had command  
Of the world, a wrath of angels  
They're bought and sold on a shake of a hand  
  
And I, I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels for you  
  
I know you've seen all those romantic movies  
How the hero comes to take you away  
But then you wake up and you're all alone now  
But that's all gonna change today  
  
Remember being all alone  
Remember crying on a rainy day  
It don't have to be that bad now  
It don't have to be that way  
  
And I know what it's like baby to fall in love  
Because I've fallen in love with you  
It's true, yeah it's true  
  
And I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels for you, yeah  
  
And I know what it's like baby to fall in love  
Because I've fallen in love with you  
It's true, yeah it's true  
  
And I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels for you  
  
And I'm head over heels for you  
And I'm here to say that it's true  
I'm head over heels  
I'm head over heels  
I'm head over heels for you

It's been a cold, cold, cold, cold night tonight  
And I can't get you off my mind  
God knows I've tried  
Did I throw away the best part of my life  
When I cut you off, did I cut myself with the same damn knife  
Hide my tears in the pouring rain, had my share of hurt and pain  
Don't say my name, run away, cause it's all in vain  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try  
Hey I cried, Yeah I lied, Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons, let's just fold the cards and say good-bye  
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
It's been a long, long, long, long, long time  
Since I've had your love here in my hands  
We didn't understand it, we couldn't understand it  
But, nothing's fair in love and hate  
You lay it all down and walk away , before it's too late  
We danced all night as the music played  
The sheets got tangled in the mess we made  
There in the stains , we remain,  
No one left to blame  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try  
Hey I cried, Yeah I lied, Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons, let's just fold the cards and say good-bye  
It's all right, just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
Go on, get on with your life, Yeah - I'll get on with mine  
Broken hearts can't call the cops, yeah it's the perfect crime  
Twisting and turning the night keeps me yearning  
I'm burning alive  
I'm paying the price again  
But I'll see the light again  
  
My heart's breaking even, now there's no use we even try  
Hey I cried, Yeah I lied, Hell I almost died  
Both got our reasons, let's just fold the cards and say good-bye  
It's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight  
  
Yeah  
Yeah  
  
Oh I'm going, gonna walk out the door  
Saying you don't care for me anymore  
That's alright, just two hearts breaking even tonight

Hey God, I'm just a little man  
I got a wife and family  
I almost lost my house  
I bought into the dream  
We're barely holdin' on and I'm in way too deep  
We're two paychecks away from livin' out on the street  
  
She's a workin' single mom  
Like a saint she don't complain  
She never says a word but she thinks that she's to blame  
Her son just got convicted  
He blew some cop away  
She did her best to raise him but the world got in the way  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin' on  
It seems like all the good shit's gone  
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
There's nights you know I want to scream  
These days you're even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
Born into the ghetto, 1991  
Just a happy child playin' beneath the summer sun  
A vacant lot's his playground  
By 12 he's got a gun  
The odds are bet against him  
Junior don't make 21  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin' on  
It seems like all the good shit's gone  
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
There's nights you know I want to scream  
These days you're even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
I get down on my knees  
I'm gonna try this thing your way  
I seen a dyin' man to proud to beg  
Spit on his own grave  
Was he too gone to save  
Or did you even know his name  
Are you the one to blame  
I got something to say  
  
Hey God  
Tell me what the hell is goin' on  
It seems like all the good shit's gone  
It keeps on gettin' harder hangin' on  
But hey hey hey hey God  
There's nights you know I want to scream  
These days you're even harder to believe  
I know how busy you must be  
But hey hey hey hey God  
Do you ever think about me  
  
Do you ever think about me

Every day of my life has been  
Leading me here tonight  
Feels like I'm coming home  
Back to you, back to you  
  
Every chance that I take  
Every wrong turn and every mistake  
Is a step on the road  
Back to you and I'm alive  
  
I like it, I like it, I can't get enough  
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know what I like, yeah I get a rush  
  
And my goal, I see you  
You're as close as the hole in my shoe  
And when I'm feeling used  
I'm renewed, I get high  
  
I can fly, I've got wings  
I've got riches that money can't bring  
I've got more than a king, I've got you  
And baby that's alright  
  
I like it, I like it, I can't get enough  
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know what I like, I get a rush from you  
  
Everything you do, I call it love  
Yeah, I get a rush, I get a rush, yeah  
  
Every day of my life  
Has been leading me here tonight  
And wherever I roam I'm heading  
Back home to you, back to you  
  
'Cause I like it, I like it, I can't get enough  
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know what I like, yeah I get a rush  
  
I like it, I like it, I can't get enough  
I like it, I like it, yeah I get a rush  
I like what I like and I like it too much  
You know I like, I get a rush from you  
  
Everything you do, I call it love  
Yeah, I get a rush, I get a rush from you

Hello, baby, it's only me  
I know you're tired, it's been a long hard week  
I was thinking maybe if you ain't got no plans  
I just wanna be your man  
Tonight I wanna be your man  
Know what you're thinking, that you've got your doubts  
I'm the only one that knows what your dreams are about  
If you say no then I will understand  
I just wanna be your man  
Tonight I wanna be your man  
And all I want is to dream out loud  
We used to think we had it all worked out  
I know that you don't want to be alone  
The streets outside are so damn cold  
You still ever think of you and me as 'us'?  
Or another thing we let die and turn to dust?  
I wasn't there to clean the cuts  
I want the one who got caught in the ruts  
I was just thinking maybe if you got no plans  
I...  
I just wanna...  
Tonight I wanna be your man

I always knew, that I'd like this place  
You don't have to look too far, to find a friendly face  
I feel alive when I'm walkin' on this street  
I feel the heart of the city poundin' underneath my feet  
  
[Chorus:]  
Yeah let the world keep spinnin' round 'n' round  
This is where it all goes down, down, down  
That's why I love this town  
That's why I keep comin' 'round  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
You make me feel at home some how, right now  
That's why I love this town  
  
I've got some good friends here, I might have broke a heart or two  
It's gettin' loud over there, boys must have had a few  
And hey the cop on the corner, he knows everybody's name  
And a kid with a train singin' for some spare loose change  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
You make me feel at home some how, right now  
That's why I love this town  
  
There's shoutin' from the rooftops  
Dancin' on the bars  
Hangin' out the window  
Drivin' in their famous cars  
You want it? You got it  
You ready? I'm on it  
Come on now, here we go again...  
  
That's why I love this town  
That's why I love this town  
  
No matter where you're from, tonight you're from right here  
This is where it all goes down, down, down  
That's why I love this town  
  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town  
Say hey (Say hey) say yeah (Say yeah)  
I love this town

I talk to jesus  
  
It's like trying to light a match in the rain  
Trying to find a way to explain  
I came to meet the face that graced me cable tv  
I'm his biggest fan, 'like this, him and me  
  
Has he gone out, is he in a meeting  
I know that you can't tell me for security reasons  
  
But, Mister, tell me are you one of the Saints  
Hey, maybe I could take a number and wait  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
And I talk, talk, I talk to Jesus  
  
See, I've got a picture of us here in my wallet  
I'd really like to show you...  
Oh, I guess I forgot it  
But, I've got this bracelet, I've got this I'd  
That the people down at county gave me  
  
I know you think I'm special, hear it all the time  
You don't have to V. I. P. Me, I'm a regular guy  
I'd really like to sit and talk sometimes  
But, I'm taping Sally Jesse at five  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus, the king can save me  
I talk, talk, talk, I talk to Jesus  
  
Have you seen the papers today  
If I could, I'd get down and pray  
Tell me if the shepherds on the way  
  
You know Elvis Presley talks to me  
Through my school teacher  
Jon Lennon moved in down the street  
He bought the pizzeria  
  
And aliens control our lives  
And when we speak, they're in our minds  
And Heather Locklear is my wife  
And, Man ain't a lucky guy  
  
I talk to Jesus, you don't believe me  
I talk to Jesus, I know he hears me  
I talk to Jesus and Elvis Presley  
I talk to Jesus, the king can save me  
I talk, talk, talk, I talk to Jesus

You didn't have to love me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did  
And I thank you  
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
  
If you took your love to someone else  
I know what I meant to be the loving dare  
You made me feel like I've never felt  
Your kiss is so good, I got the holler for help  
  
You didn't have to squeeze me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to hold me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
  
Now every day there's something new  
You put your make-up and your mild perfume  
You got me trying to do things, too  
Just so that I can keep up with you  
  
You didn't have to shake me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to make me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
  
All my life I've been short changed  
Without your love it would be a crying shame  
Now I know what love I'm looking for  
When they say they're being turned on  
  
I wanna thank you, thank you, thank you  
Thank you, baby, thank you, thank you I got to say  
  
You didn't have to love me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
You didn't have to hold me, like you did  
But you didn't, but you did, and I thank you  
I wanna thank you, baby I wanna thank you, let me count the ways  
Let me thank you, baby, baby I've got something to say  
  
Thank you baby  
Let me count the ways, for the whole wide world to hear, oh yeah  
Now thank you for paying for my cold beer  
I wanna thank you for being here with me baby  
Thank you for understanding why I was out so late last night  
Thank you for giving me your best friend's phone number  
Thank you for understanding, that me and your sister are just good friends.

I had a roof overhead  
Had shoes on my feet  
Yeah, sure I was fed  
But no one was there when I was in need, yeah  
  
So who am I now?  
Who do you want me to be?  
I can forgive you but I won't re-live you  
I ain't the same scared kid I used to be  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
I don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to be loved  
I want to be loved  
  
I found a picture  
Our so-called family tree, yeah  
I broke all the branches lookin' for answers  
Don't you know that ain't how it's supposed to be?  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
I don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give  
I'm ready to try  
Willing to lay it on the line  
I want to be loved  
I want to be  
  
I ain't gonna cry, I don't want to scream  
But I got so much left unsaid inside of me  
  
I'm gonna live  
I'm gonna survive  
Don't want the world to pass me by  
I'm gonna dream  
I ain't gonna die  
Thinking my life was just a lie  
I want to give  
I'm ready to try  
Willing to lay it on the line  
I want to beloved  
I want to be loved  
I just want to be love  
I want to be loved [Repeat: x3]

The last time I saw her  
Was the night she said goodbye  
She said that loves a stranger  
And it's sure to pass you by, yes she did  
As she packed up her belongings  
Baby wouldn't look me in the eye  
But I could see a tear roll  
Off her face  
As we both tried so hard  
Not to cry she said  
  
I never wanted the stars  
Never shot for the moon  
I like them right where they are  
All I wanted was you  
So baby just turn away  
Because I can't face the truth  
All I'm trying to say  
Is all I wanted was you  
  
I tried so hard to remember  
Where when how why love went away  
I tried to drown myself in pity  
But your memory kept calling your name, yes it did  
  
I bought you fancy cars and diamond rings, baby  
All the things that money brings  
And the servants to paint the sky blue  
And I worked so hard seven days a week  
And built a fortress for your heart to keep  
If I could I'd wrap these words up for you  
  
I never wanted the stars  
Never shot for the moon  
I like them right where they are  
All I wanted was you  
So baby just turn away  
Because I can't face the truth  
All I'm trying to say  
Is all I wanted was you  
  
I want you, I want you, baby I want you  
  
But never thought you were alone  
I filled the party up with company  
But never made our house a home  
  
All I've got is my guitar these chords and the truth  
All I've got is my guitar, but all, baby all I want  
  
I never wanted the stars  
Never shot for the moon  
I like them right where they are  
All I wanted was you  
So baby just turn away  
Because I can't face the truth  
All I'm trying to say  
Is all I wanted was you  
  
I want you, I want you, baby I want you [Repeat: x4]

If you could see inside my heart  
Then you 'd understand  
I'd never mean to hurt you  
Baby I'm not that kind of man  
  
I might not say I'm sorry  
Yeah, I might talk tough sometimes  
And I might forget the little things  
Or keep you hanging on the line  
  
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet  
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget  
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry  
  
[Chorus]  
I'd die for you  
I'd cry for you  
I'd do anything  
I'd lie for you  
You know it's true  
Baby I'd die for you  
I'd die for you  
I'd cry for you  
If it came right down to me and you  
You know it's true, Baby I'd die for you  
  
I might not be a savior  
And I'll never be a king  
I might not send you roses  
Or buy you diamond rings  
  
But if I could see inside you  
Maybe I'd know just who we are  
Cause our love is like a hunger  
Without it we would starve  
  
In a world that don't know Romeo and Juliet  
Boy meets girl and promises we can't forget  
We are cast from Eden's gate with no regrets  
Into the fire we cry  
  
[Chorus]

Are. Sambora  
  
If God was a woman  
  
If God was a woman  
With long blond hair  
Would you kneel at her altar  
And offer her prayer  
Could she be your addiction  
Could she make you sin  
If God was a woman  
And you were her man  
If God was a woman  
Would you be impressed  
If she showed up in high heels  
And a pretty red dress  
Would you make a donation  
Or would you draw the line  
Would you yield to temptation  
Or savor her wine  
If God was a woman  
Shed come like an angel  
Or a devil in disguise  
When she left in the morning  
Would you lose your religion  
Or kiss your faith goodbye, goodbye  
If God was a woman.  
If God was a woman  
Tell me who could we blame  
Would she make jesus righteous  
Or completely insane  
If God was a woman  
Would she kiss and tell  
Would we wind up in heaven  
Or would we all burn in hell.  
If God was a woman  
Shed come like an angel  
Or a devil in disguise, oh yeah  
And if she left in the morning  
Would you lose your religion  
Or kiss your faith goodbye, goodbye  
If God was a woman  
And you were her man, yeah  
Solo  
If God was a woman  
Would she come like an angel  
Or a devil in disguise, oh yeah  
When she left in the morning  
Would you lose your religion  
Or kiss your faith goodbye, goodbye  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
Wes all burn in hell  
If God was a  
Woman, woman, woman, woman  
If God was a woman  
Tell me who would we blame  
If God was a woman  
If God was a woman  
Shed drive us insane, yeah

Oooh  
  
It's hard to remember a time  
When I didn't have you  
Didn't have nothing but a cold bed to come to at night  
That was all I knew  
Until there was you  
  
And then you took my world  
And turned it all around  
I couldn't live without you now  
  
Baby  
If I can't have your love  
If I can't feel your touch  
I got nothin'  
Baby  
If I can't taste your kiss  
Then I don't exist  
I got nothin' yeah  
  
No I can't imagine livin' life without you  
I can't imagine livin' life without your love  
  
I wake up with you by my side  
I can't let go  
I can't even bear the thought of you in another man's eyes  
I would lose control  
I would die  
  
'Cause now you're in my heart  
And I can't let you out  
I gotta keep you here, somehow  
  
Baby  
If I can't have your love  
If I can't feel your touch  
I've got nothing  
Baby  
If I can't taste your kiss  
Then I don't exist  
I got nothing  
If I can't be your man  
I wouldn't know who I am  
I got nothing, I got nothing  
  
(whispered)  
No I can't imagine living life without you  
I can't imagine living life without your love  
  
(Sung)  
'Cause I can't imagine living live without you  
Can't imagine living life wiouthout your love  
  
Believe me baby I don't mean to doubt you  
But if you ever leave  
That would be the end of me  
Baby, Baby  
  
If I can't feel your touch I got nothin'  
If I can't taste your kiss then I don't exist  
Then I got nothin'  
I got nothin'  
  
Baby  
If I can't be your man  
I wouldn't know who I am  
I'd be nothing  
Baby  
If I can't have your love  
If I can't feel your touch  
I've got nothin' (yeah-h)  
  
No I can't imagine living life without you  
No I can't imagine living life without your love

If I was your mother  
Would you let me hold your hand  
Would you say you were my baby  
Would you always be my friend  
If I was your mother  
Could I teach you what's right  
Could I tell you stories, maybe tuck you in  
And kiss you sweet goodnight  
  
Tell me what I got to do  
To make my life mean more to you  
I could get so close it's true  
If I was your mother  
Would you always believe me  
'cause I'd wake up in the middle of the night  
Just to see if you need me  
Tell me there's no other  
To who you're telling secrets  
And would you tell me 'bout all the boys  
You been bringing home to meet me  
  
Tell me what I got to do  
To make my life mean more to you  
I could get so close it's true  
If I was your  
Tell me who I got to be  
To make you a part of me  
There's no one else you'll ever need  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
  
When love is blood you're never on trial  
It don't get deeper than a mother and child  
Oh, baby I got to get that close to you  
  
Tell me what I got to do  
To make my life mean more to you  
I could get so close it's true  
If I was yours  
Tell me who I got to be  
To make you a part of me  
There's no one else you'd ever need  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
Yeah  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
If I was your mother, mother  
  
If I was your mother, mother [Repeat: x6]

Young and wired  
Set to explode in the heat  
You won't tire  
Cause baby was born with the beat  
Take you higher than you've ever known  
Then drive you down to your knees  
I pick you up when you've had enough  
You been burned baby lessons learned  
  
In and out of love  
Hear what I'm sayin'  
In and out of love  
It's the way that we're playing  
In and out of love  
Too much is never enough  
She's gonna get ya.  
  
Running wild  
When me and my boys hit the streets  
Right on time  
She's here to make my night complete  
Then I'm long gone I got another show  
One more town, one mile to go  
One endless night of fantasy  
Is all she left of her with me  
  
In and out of love  
Hear what I'm sayin'  
In and out of love  
It's the way that we're playing  
In and out of love  
When we're together  
In and out of love  
It's too much forever  
  
In and out of love  
Hear what I'm saying  
In and out of love  
It's the way that we're playing  
In and out of love  
Too much is never enough  
She's gonna get you  
  
In and out of love

Are. Sambora  
  
Life is a road  
Forever winding where it leads us  
I don't know  
In it together  
For better or worse  
Searching for our pal of gold.  
Time  
Leaves a trail of broken hearts  
So many arrows just keep missing  
Their mark  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow  
Youre dreaming of  
Nothing else matters at all  
When youre in it for love, baby  
Yeah  
Well share in the laughter  
Share in the tears  
And the promises we keep  
Life can be crazy  
Love can be cruel  
But its always been a two way street  
You try  
And give it all you have to give  
So many people don't know how to forgive  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow  
Youre dreaming of  
Nothing else matters at all  
When youre in it for love, baby.  
Solo  
You try  
And give it all you have to give  
So many people don't know how to forgive  
Baby that aint us.  
Nothing else matters  
When youre in it for love  
Together we can only go higher  
You can reach any rainbow  
Youre dreaming of  
Nothing else matters at all  
When youre in it for love baby.  
When youre in it for love baby  
In it for love  
When youre in it for love baby  
When youre in it for love baby  
When youre in it for love baby  
In it for love.

This ain't a song for the broken-hearted  
No silent prayer for the faith-departed  
I ain't gonna be just a face in the crowd  
You're gonna hear my voice  
When I shout it out loud  
  
It's my life  
It's now or never  
I ain't gonna live forever  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
(It's my life)  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
It's my life  
  
This is for the ones who stood their ground  
For Tommy and Gina who never backed down  
Tomorrow's getting harder, make no mistake  
Luck ain't even lucky  
Got to make your own breaks  
  
It's my life  
And it's now or never  
I ain't gonna live forever  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
(It's my life)  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
'Cause it's my life  
  
Better stand tall when they're calling you out  
Don't bend, don't break, baby, don't back down  
  
It's my life  
And it's now or never  
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
(It's my life)  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
(It's my life)  
And it's now or never  
'Cause I ain't gonna live forever  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
(It's my life)  
My heart is like an open highway  
Like Frankie said  
I did it my way  
I just want to live while I'm alive  
'Cause it's my life

J. Bon jovi  
  
Sitting here just watching you sleep  
Wish I could slip inside and be  
In some technicolor dream  
But the airs too thick for one of us to breathe  
I'm not fool enough to think  
You couldn't live life without me  
  
I didn't come this far to throw the towel in  
I didn't fight this hard to walk away  
If I aint smart enough to say I'm sorry  
Its just because the words got in the way  
  
I remember how it used to be  
I was you and you were me  
We were more than just the same  
Now these shoes don't fit, my skins too tight  
When you want a kiss, I take a bite  
Let your heart call up the cops, read me my rights  
  
Last night I drak enough to drown  
Raise a toast to your good looks and to my health  
Look, we both know how much I've let you down  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
You deserve a shooter, a saint  
Someone to give it to you straight  
To find the soul throught flesh and bone  
My lifes a treasure, full of sunny weather  
But its left me feeling cold  
Now all you want to do is take me home  
  
I hated you, the night you said you loved me  
I hated you, cause I couldn't love myself  
I'm begging you now, baby please just hold me  
I got one foot in, one foot off the ground  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Sitting here while youre fast asleep  
In the bathroom by the sink  
Trying to write the right words down  
I turn out the lights, close my eyes  
There aint no prayers or kiss goodnight  
What Ill forget to say tomorrow, Ill say now  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
Janie don't you take your love to town  
If I've got to beg, Ill beg, just don't walk away  
Janie don't you take your love to town

I got no time for the corner boys  
Down in the street making all that noise  
Or the girls out on the avenue  
'Cause tonight I wanna be with you  
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride  
Across the river to the Jersey side  
Take my baby to the carnival  
And I'll take her on all the rides  
  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
You know all my dreams come true  
When I'm walking down the street with you  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
You know she thrills me with all her charms  
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms  
My little girl gives me everything  
I know that some day she'll wear my ring  
So don't bother me man I ain't got no time  
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine  
'Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
I see you on the street and you look so tired  
I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired  
When I come by to take you out to eat  
You're lyin' all dressed up on the bed baby fast asleep  
Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on  
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom's  
I know a place where the dancing's free  
Now baby won't you come with me  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
Nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

You take and you take without giving  
Like the ride is never going to end  
You think you know who's going to Heaven  
Well I know I'm going to see you again  
On Judgement Day  
Others, they walk the bad road  
If you do you better watch what you say  
You think that you can hide in your shadow  
But it's your shadow gonna ruin your way  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire, no where to run to, no one to blame  
Cause Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day  
  
Some people they call me brother  
Some people they say that they care  
Some people they steal from the Heavens above  
It's going to be a cross to bear  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire  
With nowhere to run to, no one to blame  
Well Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day  
  
It's just you and me  
I won't fade away  
Let's face up to the truth  
It's our own Judgement Day  
  
On Judgement Day  
You walk through the fire  
Nowhere to run to, no one to blame  
Hey, Hey, Hey  
Winners and losers, sinners and users, will all have to pay  
On Judgement Day

Mother mother tell your children  
That their time has just begun  
I have suffered for my anger  
There are wars that can't be won  
  
Father father please believe me  
I am laying down my guns  
I am broken like an arrow  
Forgive me  
Forgive your wayward son  
  
Everybody needs somebody to love  
(mother, mother)  
Everybody needs somebody to hate  
(please believe me)  
Everybody's bitching  
'cause they can't get enough  
And it's hard to hold on  
When there's no one to lean on  
  
Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain  
Lord you got to keep the faith  
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate  
Right now we got to  
Keep the faith  
Keep the faith  
Keep the faith  
Lord we got to keep the faith  
  
Tell me baby when I hurt you  
Do you keep it all inside  
Do you tell me al's forgiven  
And just hide behind your pride  
  
Everybody needs somebody to love  
(mother, father)  
Everybody needs somebody to hate  
(please don't leave me)  
Everybody's bleeding  
'cause the times are tough  
Well it's hard to be strong  
When there's no one to dream on  
  
Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain  
Lord you got to keep the faith  
Now you know is not too late  
Oh you got to keep the faith  
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate  
Right now we got to  
Keep the faith  
Keep the faith  
Keep the faith  
Lord we got to keep the faith  
  
Walking in the footsteps  
Of society's lies  
I don't like what I see no more  
Sometimes I wish that I was blind  
Sometimes I wait forever  
  
To stand out in the rain  
So no one sees me cryin'  
Trying to wash away the pain  
Mother father  
  
There's things I've done I can't erase  
Every night we fall from grace  
  
It's hard with the world in yours face  
Trying to hold on, trying to hold on  
  
Faith: you know you're gonna live thru the rain  
Lord you got to keep the faith  
Faith: don't let your love turn to hate  
Right now we got to keep the faith  
Faith: now it's not too late  
Try to hold on, trying to hold on  
Keep the faith

Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out  
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls  
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout  
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control  
  
I been down and mistreated  
Now we're standing undefeated  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm the King of the Mountain  
I'm the King of the Hill  
I'm the King of the Mountain  
I'm the King of the Hill  
  
You spend your life working 9 to 5 it's like doing time  
Boss man says "Hey boy, you'll never be no good"  
With the night there's a magic in the air that makes us come alive  
Tonight's the night they can't put you down, no one could  
  
I been down and mistreated  
Now we're standing undefeated  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen people can't you hear the voices that are crying out.  
There's a hunger burning in the heart of their souls.  
Maybe now that I got you let me tell you what I'm talking 'bout  
Stand up and shout tonight we'll lose control  
  
I been down and mistreated  
We won't be cheated  
Now we're standing undefeated  
  
[Chorus]

Come see a living, breathing spectacle  
Only seen right here  
It's your last chance in this lifetime  
The line forms to the rear  
You won't believe your eyes  
Your eyes will not believe you're ears  
Get your money out, get ready  
Step right up, yeah you, come here  
  
You ain't seen nothing like him  
the last one of the breed  
You better hold on to your honey  
Honeys, don't forget to breathe  
Enter at your own risk, mister  
It might change the way you think  
There's no dancers, there's no diamonds  
No this boy he don't lip-synch  
  
[Chorus:]  
Here's the last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing  
The last chance of a lifetime  
Come and see, hear, feel, the real thing  
  
See those real live calloused fingers  
Wrapped around those guitar strings  
Kiss the lips where hurt has lingered  
It breaks the hart to hear him sing  
The songs were more than music  
They were pictures from the soul  
Se keep your pseudo-punk, hip-hop, pop-rock junk  
And your digital downloads  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take your seats now, folks. It's showtime  
Hey, Patrick - hit the lights  
There's something in the air  
There's magic in the night  
Now here's the band, they really play  
I'll count the first one in  
I don't know where it's gone  
Well all know where it's been  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The last man standing  
Step right up, he's the real thing  
The last chance of a lifetime  
Come see, hear, feel, the real thing.

If you're ready, I'm willing and able  
Help me lay my cards on the table  
You're mine and I'm yours for the taking  
Right now the rules we made  
Are meant for breaking  
  
What you get ain't always  
What you see  
But satisfaction's guaranteed  
They say what you give is always  
What you need  
So if you want me to  
Lay my hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me [Repeat: x4]  
  
Lay you hands on me  
  
I'm a fighter, I'm a poet  
I'm a preacher  
I've been to school and  
Baby, I've been the teacher  
If you show me how to get  
Up off the ground  
I can show you  
How to fly and never  
Ever come back down  
  
Everything you want  
Is what I need  
Satisfaction guaranteed  
But the ride don't never ever  
Come for free  
If you want me to lay  
My hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me [Repeat: x4]  
  
Lay your hands on me  
  
Don't you know I only aim to please  
If you want me to lay  
My hands on you  
  
Lay your hands on me

The weekend comes to this town  
Seven days too soon  
For the ones who have to make up  
What we break up of their rules  
  
Well I saw Captain Kidd on Sunset  
Tell his boys they're in command  
While Chino danced a tango  
With a broomstick in his hand  
He said: It's alright (alright) if you have a good time  
It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line  
To break on through to the other side  
  
Let it rock, let it go  
You can't stop a fire burning out of control  
Let it rock, let it go  
With the night you're on the loose  
You got to let it rock  
  
We go down to the Broadway  
Where everybody goes  
To get on their rockin' horse  
And blast that radio  
Well I saw Roxie on the table  
Her girlfriend down below  
They'll give it to the king of swing  
Before it's time to go  
  
They said, It's alright (alright) if you have a good time  
It's alright (alright) if you want to cross that line  
To break on through to the other side  
  
Let it rock, let it go  
You can't stop a fire burning out of control  
Let it rock, let it go  
With the night you're on the loose  
You got to let it rock

When I look in your eyes I can feel the fire.  
A see through disguise cant conceal desire  
I've been readin' your lips, they don't need no translation  
They want more than a kiss, I come to make my donation  
  
So turn out the lights, I'm going down slowly.  
Don't tell me what's right. Just tell me you want me.  
Tell me you want me.  
Just tell me you want me, want me, want me  
  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
  
Come, come, come a little bit closer  
I want to play doctor.  
It keeps getting harder, harder, harder to keep me away  
I want to taste the sweat that's runnin' off of your body.  
Get the sheets all wet, I wanna make you feel naughty  
  
Lets make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
  
Turn out the lights  
Don't tell me you love me  
Just tell me you want me,  
Don't tell me you love me  
Tell me you want me, want me,  
Want me, want me, want me, want me, want me  
  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby  
Let's make it baby

It ain't no fun lying down to sleep  
And there ain't no secrets left for me to keep  
I wish the stars up in the sky  
Would all just call in sick  
And the clouds would take the moon out  
On some one-way trip  
  
I drove all night down streets that wouldn't bend  
But somehow they drove me back here once again  
To the place I lost at love, and the place I lost my soul  
I wish I'd just burn down this place that we called home  
It would all have been so easy  
If you'd only made me cry  
And told me how you're leaving me  
To some organ grinder's lullaby  
  
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart  
It's hard letting you go  
  
Now the sky, it shines a different kind of blue  
And the neighbor's dog don't bark like he used to  
Well - me, these days  
I just miss you - it's the nights that I go insane  
Unless you're coming back for me  
That's one thing I know that won't change  
  
It's hard, so hard - it's tearing out my heart  
It's hard letting you go  
  
Now some tarot card shark said i'll draw you a heart  
And we'll find you somebody else new  
But I've made my last trip to those carnival lips  
When I bet all that I had on you  
  
It's hard, it's hard, it's hard, so hard  
It's hard letting you go  
It's hard, so hard, it's tearing out my heart  
But it's hard letting you go

She was waiting alone at the station  
Praying for her train to arrive  
Thinking 'bout her destination  
The tattered bag had all she had in life  
  
She turned her back on her family  
She turned her back on her friends  
She turned her back on a married man  
When she took off that wedding band  
  
She said, "I'm giving up, silver clouds have turned to gray  
Had enough, there's got to be a better way"  
Giving up, you know you've gotta walk  
There's some things in life still worth fighting for  
  
Ain't no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing  
  
This time he said was the last time  
Last time he said just the same  
In your heart you know that they'll be a next time  
That your battered bones would have to explain  
  
Giving up, nothing's changing but the score  
Had enough, every night love turns to war  
Give it up, gave it all and wanted more  
It ain't nothing worth dying for  
  
It's no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word, love ain't nothing  
  
Forget your mama's Rosary beads  
To get you through this time of need  
You know you gotta cross that line  
You take it one day at a time  
  
Had enough, the silver clouds all turning gray  
I'm heading for a better day  
  
It's no big secret so forget all you've heard  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
For some it's for better, for some it's for worse  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing, it ain't nothing now, baby  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
Love ain't nothing, nothing now, baby  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
Love ain't nothing  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
Love ain't nothing  
Love ain't nothing but a four-letter word  
  
Love ain't nothing

Well, I wake up this morning, I rolled out of bed  
I felt like a dog who's been kicked in the head  
Checked out my mail, there was letter that read  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
I picked up the phone, I called everyone I could  
I let my fingers do the walking through the telephone book  
You can't catch a fish if you ain't got the hook  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
Send up a signal, throw me a line  
Somebody explain "this funny Valentine"  
It might not be legal but it sure ain't a crime  
I'm one step from crazy and two steps behind  
  
I called Lieutenant Columbo from my TV set  
I've tried the Dating Game, I haven't found her yet  
I'm hoping that she's looking like a Penthouse Pet  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
We've been living together three years  
Two hours, twenty minutes, maybe four hundred beers  
You can't shop for love when you're shopping at Sears  
Love for sale, love for sale  
  
I guess I've learned my lesson, it was easy to see  
My old lady, she played this joke on me  
I never looked where I forgot it would be  
Love for sale, love for sale

Love hurts, love scars, love wounds and harms  
Any heart not tough or strong enough  
To take a lot of pain, take a lot of pain  
Love is like a cloud, holds a lot of rain  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
'Cause I'm young, I know but even so  
I know a thing or two, that I've learned from you  
Really learned a lot, really taught me a lot  
Love is like a flame, it burns yourself when it's hot  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
Some fools think of happiness, blissfulness, togetherness  
Some fools fool themselves, I guess  
They ain't foolin' me I know it isn't true, I know it isn't true  
Love is like a flame, makes your heart so blue  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee, love hurts  
  
I really learned a lot, really learned a lot  
Love is like a flame, it burns you when it's hot  
Love hurts, ooeee-ooeee yes, love hurts  
Ooeee-ooeee yes, love hurts, love hurts  
  
Na na na na na yeah, love hurts  
Na na na na na yeah, love hurts  
Na na na na na yeah, love hurts

Load your guns, take sides  
Raise your flag, cause baby, love is war  
  
Hey baby, what ever happened to the girl next door  
If I remember, she looked a lot like you  
Whatever happened to the boy who said, Id die for you  
Were hangin on, but love is gone and now its war  
  
You got your weapons, baby I got mine  
You tried to trap me with your bedroom eyes  
Under the covers, cross the enemy lines  
When you dont know, you just say no.  
  
Tell me why, love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is tryin to even the score  
Its the way of the world, love is war  
Where boy meets girl, love is war  
  
Oh I remember when the love was good and the bed was hot  
But now we sleep on separate sides and the sheets are cold  
Aw, I used to love your candy baby, now the store is closed  
  
I know my silence tears you up inside  
You built a fortress for your hurt to hide  
You think youve won, but its a tie  
cause nobody wins a war of pride  
  
Tell me why, love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is tryin to even the score  
Its the way of the world, love is war  
Where boy meets girl, love is war  
  
Tell me why, love is war  
What the hell are we fighting for  
  
Tell me why love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is trying to even the score  
Its the way of the world, love is war  
  
Tell me why love is war  
When the battle is done you still want more  
Every broken heart is trying to even up the score  
Its the way of the world, love is war  
  
War, love is war, war, love is war  
War, love is war, war, love is war

I was lost, then I found you.  
I never thought it would be this way.  
Showed you my heart, I left it unguarded,  
Like a thief in the night you stole it away.  
  
Now you're gone, the pain goes on and on.  
I still hear you whispering to me through the shadows of the night.  
  
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
You're just a number of the love lies.  
  
All alone you call it survival,  
He lost at love to a stranger's lines.  
Walking the streets, searching with vengence  
For a face that he dreams of night after night.  
  
Time goes on, all signs of life stolen, simple dreams were all broken.  
Best of times become desperation but how many tears must you cry to survive?  
  
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.  
  
Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.  
  
They met late one night in the city.  
Both men knew only one would stay.  
Scratched a picture of a heart on a bullet  
And took his life away.  
  
Love lies, you're just another victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.  
  
Love lies, you're just a victim of the headlines.  
You're running on into a cold night.  
Just a number of the love lies.

I don't give a damn how it's supposed to be  
That might work for you, it don't work for me  
You write your truth and I'll write mine  
One man's ceiling's another man's sky high  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Crying like the lonely whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
Spit in the eye of a hurricane  
Who said life has got to be so cruel  
Love's the only rule  
  
It's written in the stars where I fit in  
It's going to hurt sometimes, you got to lose to win  
You got your sins and I got mine  
Sell your secrets, kiss them all goodbye  
  
Flying like an aeroplane  
Alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like it's a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldn't say  
Think about it, wouldn't that be cool?  
Love's the only rule  
  
Might be a wrecking ball  
Or just a wake up call  
Don't matter where the pieces fall  
  
Woohoo's  
Woohoo's  
Woohoo's  
  
I'm gonna fly like an aeroplane  
Cry like the whistle of a long black train  
Dance in the pouring rain  
I'm alive like a lonely note from John Coltrane  
Run like its a getaway  
Say those things that you shouldn't say  
  
Where love, love's the only rule  
Yes love, love's the only rule

Are. Sambora  
  
Made in america  
Nineten fifteen nine  
Born down by the factories  
Cross the jersey city line  
Raised on radio  
Just a jukebox kid  
I was alright  
Just a small town homeboy  
With big time dreams  
Foollowing his conscience  
In a world full of extremes  
Fresh outta high school  
Only seventeen  
I was alright  
Blinded by my vision  
There ws just no turning back  
Lika a runaway train  
Life was steaming down the track  
Youd say Id never make it out  
But I kept on hanging on  
Every night I prayed to jesus  
And held my head up strong  
I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
My old mans independence  
Seemed good enough for me  
I was made in america  
Made in america  
Never cared much about politics  
Til I was twenty one  
But I woke up when lennon  
Found the wrong end of a gun  
He left his inspiration  
Before he said boodbye  
And we were alright  
We all lose out innocence  
Its impossible to hold  
I didn't know it then  
I had a packet full of gold  
When I kissed those younger days goodbye  
It almost broke my heart  
I was going to ghrough my growing pains  
I was driving in the dark  
But I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
I'm facing up to freedom  
And chacing down my dream  
I was made in america  
Yeah I was made in america  
Yeah we all lose our innocence  
Its impossible to hold  
I just didn't know it then  
I had a packet full of gold  
When they said Id never make it  
I just kept on hanging on  
And every night I prayed to jesus  
And I held my head up strong  
And I was alright  
I landed on my feet  
Made in america  
I was brought up on the street  
Facing up to who I am  
Chasing down my dream  
I was made in america  
Yeah I was made in america

Hello again, it's you and me  
Kinda always like it used to be  
Sippin' wine, killin' time  
Tryin' to solve life's mysteries  
  
How's your life? It's been a while  
God, it's good to see you smile  
I see you reaching for your keys  
Looking for a reason, not to leave  
  
If you don't know if you should stay  
If you don't say what's on your mind  
Baby, just breathe  
There's nowhere else tonight we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
I dug up this old photograph  
Look at all that hair we had  
It's bittersweet to hear you laugh  
Your phone is ringing, I don't wanna ask  
  
If you go now, I'll understand  
If you stay, hey, I've got a plan  
We're gonna make a memory  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
If you don't know if you should stay  
And you don't say what's on your mind  
Baby, just breathe  
There's nowhere else tonight we should be, we should be  
You wanna make a memory  
  
You wanna steal a piece of time  
You can sing the melody to me  
And I could write a couple of lines  
  
You wanna make a memory  
You wanna make a memory

And I would give up tomorrow  
And die for one yesterday  
I'd lie, beg, steal and borrow  
To hear you whisper my name  
  
Tonight there ain't no miracles  
Washing up on this beach  
The angels left here long ago  
But I still believe  
  
That maybe someday  
I will hold your hand  
And maybe someway  
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand  
And just walk away  
Maybe someday  
  
Now I don't know how a heart beats  
But I sure know how one breaks  
Remember how I used to hold you  
To share every breath that you'd take  
  
How can I forget  
You're every tear that I cry?  
I know you're coming back  
You never kissed me goodbye  
  
Maybe someday  
I will hold your hand  
And maybe someway  
We'll trace our footsteps in the sand  
And just walk away  
  
They say that nothing lasts forever  
But we know our two hearts beat together  
And though you're far away, every night I pray  
Maybe someday, someday  
  
Maybe someday  
I will understand  
Maybe someway  
We'll trace these footsteps in the sand  
Just walk away  
  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someday  
Maybe someway

There's a town that I call home  
Where all the streets are paved with soul  
Down on Beale there's a honky-tonk bar  
So hear the wail of a blues guitar  
Have a beer and drop a dime in the blind man's jar  
The blues sing softly in the air like a Sunday morning prayer  
Just one more drink and you'll see God everywhere  
Like a sad old melody that cheers you up, it sets you free  
That's how Memphis lives in me  
There comes a time when muddy waters run rough  
There comes a point when a man has had enough  
Like a friend that always stands by me  
Memphis knows me  
Never showed me  
How did life just had to be  
I couldn't even try to run away, say goodbye  
Here I was born and here is where I'll die  
I'm just a man from Tennessee  
I can't be what I can't be  
All I know is Memphis lives in me  
I said I'm just a man from Tennessee  
Can't be what I can't be  
All I know is Memphis lives  
All I know is Memphis gives

J. bon jovi, dave stewart  
  
The kids round here look just like sticks  
They trade old licks with a beat up six  
I just smile and catch the groove  
  
Gothic girls all dress in black  
Serious as heart attacks  
It takes a little bit of getting used to  
  
The old man with the whiskey stains  
Lost the night forgot his name  
His poor wife will sleep alone again  
And it aint hard to understand  
Why shes holding on to her own hand  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
Ive seen a lone,sloane ranger drive  
Seems her chauffeur took a dive  
And sold her secrets to the sun  
And later in a magazine  
I finally figured what it means  
To be a saint, not a queen  
  
Two lustful lovers catch a spark  
And chase their shadows in the dark  
Someones getting off tonight  
Of a big red bus thats packed so tight  
It disappears in a trail of light  
Somewhere someones dreaming baby its all right...  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
Midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones pinned dreams on me  
No ones asking me to bleed  
Im the man I want to be  
When chelsea girls sing...  
  
Its morning when I go to sleep  
In the distant dawn a church bell rings  
Another day is coming on  
A babys born, an old man dies  
Somewhere young lovers kiss good-bye  
I leave my soul and just move on  
And wish that I was there to sing this song  
  
Chorus:  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones asking me for favors  
No ones looking for a savoir  
Theyre too busy saving me  
  
Its midnight in chelsea, midnight in chelsea  
No ones pinned dreams on me  
No ones asking me to bleed  
Im the man I want to be  
The man I want to be,the man I want to be  
Midnight in chelsea

A penny for your thoughts now baby  
Looks like the weight of the world's  
On your shoulders now  
  
I know you think you're going crazy  
Just when it seems everything's  
Gonna work itself out  
They drive you right back down  
  
And you said it ain't fair  
That a man walks  
When a bird can fly  
We have to kick the ground  
The stars kiss the sky  
They say that spirits live  
A man has to die  
They promised us truth  
Now they're giving us lies  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save us this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause it's all on the line  
And I won't let you down  
(No I won't let you down)  
The river of your hope is flooding  
And I know the dam is busted  
If you need me I'll come running  
I won't let you down, no, no  
  
You're looking for salvation  
You thought that it'd be shining  
Like an angel's light  
Well, the angels left this nation  
And salvation caught the last train  
Out tonight  
He lost one hell of a fight  
  
He said  
I'm just one man, that's all I'll ever be  
I never can be everything you wanted from me  
I've got plans so big  
That any blind man could see  
I'm standing in the river  
Now I'm drowning in the sea  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save us this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause your heart's on the line  
And your heartbeat is slowing down  
Your feet are grounded still  
You're reaching for the sky  
You can let 'em clip your wings  
'Cause I believe that you can fly  
  
Well my eyes have seen the horror  
Of the coming of the flood  
I've driven deep the thorny crown  
Into the soul of someone's son  
Still I'll look you in the eye  
'Cause I've believed in things I've thought  
And I'll die without regret  
For the wars I have fought  
  
Gonna take a miracle to save you this time  
And your savior has just left town  
Gonna need a miracle  
'Cause your heart's doing time  
And your conscience is calling you out  
It ain't all for nothing  
Life ain't written in the sand  
I know the tide is coming  
But it's time we made a stand  
With a miracle

I used to live but now I survive  
I used to believe but now it's just one day at a time  
The circus is gone, it's all packed away  
The clown's hat, the makeup's been packed in his case  
So we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for left us with nothing but dawn  
I used to laugh but I've learned to cry  
And I ain't too proud to let you see tears fall from these eyes  
For all of my hopes, my heartaches and fears  
For a night I just watched and you walked out of here  
I just waved goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The crown that we reached for left us with nothing  
But your thorns left me wounded not unlike the truth  
When innocence sang his last song  
He'd tell me that it's all gone  
Just look me in the eyes and say it meant nothing at all  
I used to live, I've learned to die  
And I used to dream, I used to dream  
So now we wave goodbye to Miss Fourth of July  
The queen of the roses has left us with nothing but thorns  
Don't say we've never tried, Miss Fourth of July  
The stars that we reached for, they've left us with nothing but dawn  
Oh yeah  
Nothing but a heavy hit of heartbreak  
A handful of blues  
Oh yeah  
I'll never get off these  

I've been watching my tv  
It's got a hundred different stations  
They all look the same to me  
Now I'm ready for a new sensation  
  
I'm getting ready for the big time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too  
  
In the big reclining chair  
With a cold six pack of beer  
You've got a front row seat  
Lean back and put up you're feet  
Man, the future is looking bright from here  
  
I'm getting ready for the big time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
I can taste it, I'll be prime time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too  
  
I'm getting ready for the big time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Ain't going to waste it when I'm big time  
I'll be ready for it, bing, bang, boom  
I can taste it, I'll be prime time  
Someday I'm going to be in big time news  
Don't have to take it when you're big time  
Someday you'll call me Mr. Big Time too

I've always wanted what I couldn't have  
I hope and dream that maybe someday  
That I'd find out what love was all about  
I sure grew up tonight the hard way  
Now the candy store's closed, the movie's sold out  
High Plains Drifter isn't what it's all about  
And now were parting ways, I won't say a word  
Let our broken hearts cry in their graves  
Where they'll never be heard  
  
It's more than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
Last night I saw you out with my best friend  
When I'm with you I see him in your eyes  
I want to hold you but I don't understand  
There's something there that's so hard to disguise  
  
Now tears run down your face, as you walk through the night  
Those cold empty streets leave you wondering what's right  
As you walk away with your broken heart  
Don't you try to deny that true love had torn you apart  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
It's more than we bargained for  
It's more than we bargained for  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away  
  
More than we bargained for  
Our love is the price weve paid  
And just like a fading dream....  
It's slippin' away

He was a man  
A ramblin man he was yes he was  
Guitar in hand  
His home was on the road and thats where he was  
  
Hes seen a thousand roads  
Hes been a million miles  
And when hed bend a note  
A tear would fill my eyes  
Where are you playin  
Mr. bluesman  
Mr. bluesman  
  
Town to town  
Honkytonks and dives all look the same  
His gipsy heart keeps his shadow ridin through the rain  
  
A graveyard full of scars  
His life will paint his songs  
cause when youre on the road  
Theres nowhere you belong  
Youre just alone  
Where are you playin  
Mr. bluesman  
Mr. bluesman  
  
Hes seen a thousand roads  
Hes been a million miles  
And when hed bend a note  
A tear would fill my eyes  
Where are you playin  
Mr. bluesman  
Mr. bluesman  
  
Ive paid some dues  
Now I make my living as a music man  
I play the blues  
I guess the blues must be just what I am  
  
A graveyard full of scars  
His life will paint his songs  
cause when youre on the road  
Theres nowhere you belong  
Youre just alone  
Where are you playin  
Mr. bluesman  
Mr. bluesman  
  
Hes seen a thousand roads

And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)  
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  
We'd like to know a little bit about you for our files  
We'd like to help you learn to help yourself  
Look around you, all you see are sympathetic eyes  
Stroll around the grounds until you feel at home  
And here's to you, Mrs. Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)  
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  
Hide it in a hiding place where no one ever goes  
Put it in your pantry with your cupcakes  
It's a little secret, just the Robinsons' affair  
Most of all, you've got to hide it from the kids  
Coo, coo, ca-choo, Mrs Robinson  
Jesus loves you more than you will know (Wo, wo, wo)  
God bless you please, Mrs. Robinson  
Heaven holds a place for those who pray  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)  
Sitting on a sofa on a Sunday afternoon  
Going to the candidates debate  
Laugh about it, shout about it  
When you've got to choose  
Ev'ry way you look at it, you lose  
Where have you gone, Joe DiMaggio  
A nation turns its lonely eyes to you (Woo, woo, woo)  
What's that you say, Mrs. Robinson  
Joltin' Joe has left and gone away  
(Hey, hey, hey...hey, hey, hey)

Misery likes company I like the way that sounds  
I've been trying to find the meaning  
So I can write it down  
Staring out the window it's such a long way down  
I'd like to jump but I'm afraid to hit the ground  
  
I can't write a love song the way I fell today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I've got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Since you went away  
I sing this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
I'm tired of watching TV it makes me want to scream  
Outside the world is burning  
Man it's so hard to believe  
Each day you know you're dying  
From the cradle to the grave  
I get so numb sometimes that I just feel the pain  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I got nothing to say  
Life is feeling kind of strange  
Strange enough these days  
I send this song to you whoever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms  
  
Staring at the paper I don't know what to write  
I'll have my cigarette-well, turn out the lights  
Maybe tomorrow I'll feel a different way  
But here in my delusion I don't know what to say  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
I've got nothing to say  
And I can't fight the feelings  
That are burning in my veins  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding  
  
I can't write a love song the way I feel today  
I can't sing no song of hope  
There's no one left to save  
And I can't fight the feelings buried in my brains  
I send this song to you wherever you are  
As my guitar lies bleeding in my arms

There are days when she's a whisper  
Nights when she's a scream  
A reason to wake up in the morning  
To close your eyes and dream  
  
She'll curse you like a sailor  
She'll wound you with her eyes  
She always makes it better  
But she won't apologize  
I know everything about her but don't know her at all  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a ride on a mystery train  
To a place you've never been before  
Better hold on tight to that mystery train  
You're not in Kansas anymore  
She's a ride  
Mystery train  
  
She cries because she's happy  
She sings songs when she's mad  
Like a stiff drink when you need it  
She's good at being bad  
And long before you knew her you knew she was the one  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a ride on a mystery train  
To a place you've never been before  
Better hold on tight to that mystery train  
You're not in Kansas anymore  
She's a ride  
Mystery train  
  
I know everything about her but don't know her at all  
  
[Chorus]  
She's a ride on a mystery train  
To a place I've never been before  
Better hold on tight to that mystery train  
I'm not in Kansas anymore  
She's a ride  
On a mystery train  
She's a ride  
On a mystery train

J. Bon jovi, G. Wells, M. Hudson  
  
My friend had a girlfriend  
She liked her drink  
Sucked the head off her lagger  
Threw me a wink  
And she said to me buddy, whats your sign?  
  
I was off I was runnin  
Knocked me clean off my feet  
Her tongue kept on selling  
What any blind man could see  
I just kept on stumbling through the stop signs  
  
She said what you hiding underneath that shirt?  
Right behing the buttons theres a heart that hurts  
Adams evening left the curse  
Take it off make it work  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre naked  
Naked - face it  
All I'm saying  
  
The tail you been chasing  
Put the k back in kink  
Threw a coin in her jukebox  
I started to think  
She just smiled and offered me a peace sign  
  
How far you gonna run in those designer shoes  
The soul with holes aint gonna be the one you lose  
I don't know which one is worse  
Adam, me or you  
  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre naked  
Naked - face it  
All I'm saying  
  
Take it, embrace it  
Baby, here we are  
Can't you almost... Taste it  
  
Naked - naked - just get back to basics  
Naked - face it - you can't fake it when youre  
Naked - naked - naked - naked

Looking like a train wreck  
Sipping on her long neck  
This ain't no model-actress  
She's attitude and accent (alright)  
  
Angel flying solo  
Must have gone and sold your halo  
She's accidental innocence  
And white trash elegance (alright)  
  
She's all mixed up  
Lays in bed 'til 3  
All messed up  
She's eccentricity  
  
[Chorus]  
Neurotica  
Lay your love all over me  
Come on, baby, go a little crazy on me  
Erotica  
Every school boy's fantasy  
Not your ordinary woman  
But she's extraordinary to me  
  
She got a daily new addiction  
A walking contradiction  
Chain smoking cigarettes  
Talking to her silhouette (alright)  
  
All mixed up  
A little out of time  
All messed up  
But she don't really mind  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Alright (no Jane or Gloria)  
Alright (she's schizophrenia)  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
And when I call her I got to call her  
And when I call her I call her  
  
[Chorus]

As we stood there older than men  
And younger than the boys (that's right)  
We were as still as the wind  
That blows on a hot August night  
  
And you were lonesome  
As a jukebox  
But deadly just the same  
I could be as gentle as a newborn  
Then spit into the eye of a hurricane  
  
And we knew how to laugh  
And we knew how to cry  
Yeah, we sure knew how to live  
But we don't ever  
  
Never say die  
Never say die  
  
I guess you'd say we had a pact  
These words we knew so well (that's right)  
Still they remained unspoken  
And we'd take them to the fiery  
Gates of hell  
  
Once I was afraid of love  
But when it's your brother  
Those things change  
'Cause love is just another word  
For trust  
So hear me when I say  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die  
  
Yeah, and we could run like lightning  
Through the pouring rain  
And we'll be standing like a soldier  
Who comes marching home again  
  
They ask what it is that I want written  
On the gravestone where I'll lie  
Tell them it's just my bones  
That died there  
So save the tears they'll cry  
  
My spirit is still riding somewhere  
Somewhere in this night  
When it's these three words that come to me  
As I kiss this world goodbye  
  
Never say die  
Never say no  
You got to look them in the eye  
And don't let go  
When it's your own blood you'll bleed  
And your own tears you'll cry  
When you're brought up to believe  
That it's the strong who survive  
Never say die

As I sit in this smokey room  
The night about to end  
I pass my time with strangers  
But this bottle's my only friend  
  
Remember when we used to park  
On Butler Street out in the dark  
Remember when we lost the keys  
And you lost more than that in my backseat  
  
Remember how we used to talk  
About busting out, we'd break their hearts  
Together, forever  
  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
You and me and my old friends  
Hoping it would never end  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
Holdin' on, we got to try  
Holdin' on to never say goodbye  
  
Remember days of skipping school  
Racing cars and being cool  
With a six pack and the radio  
We didn't need no place to go  
  
Remember at the prom that night  
You and me we had a fight  
But the band they played our favorite song  
And I held you in my arms so strong  
  
We danced so close  
We danced so slow  
And I swore I'd never let you go  
Together, forever  
  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
You and me and my old friends  
Hoping it would never end  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
Holdin' on, we got to try  
Holdin' on to never say goodbye  
  
I guess you'd say we used to talk  
About busting out  
We'd break their hearts  
Together, forever  
  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
You and me and my old friends  
Hoping it would never end  
Never say goodbye, never say goodbye  
Holdin' on, we got to try  
Holdin' on to never say goodbye

Time ain't nothing but time  
It's a verse with no rhyme  
Man, it all comes down to you  
  
Change ain't nothing but change  
Just the faces and the names  
But you know we're gonna make it through  
  
I'll believe  
When you don't believe in anything  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'm gonna hold you 'til your hurt is gone  
Be the shoulder that you're leaning on  
I'll be standing here  
For the next 100 years  
If it all should end tonight  
I'll know it was worth the fight  
And we'll be standing here  
For the next 100 years  
  
I, when I think that I'm losing my mind  
It all comes back to you  
  
And you, you know that it's true  
After all we've been through  
There's nothing that I wouldn't do  
  
Stand by me  
And I would gladly give up everything  
  
[Chorus: x2]

No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt  
  
Let's start this from the happy ending  
Just another white trash train-track kid  
Fighting for survival  
Trying not to do like his daddy did  
Double down the devil at three card monte  
No apology, he just knew when to quit  
Push your luck, say your prayers  
Make believe you don't care  
Take a chance, sometimes it's all you need  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
No apologies  
  
You wanna start a personal revolution  
Think of living somebody else's life  
You can lie about retribution  
But there ain't no fire in your lover's eyes  
  
Seems like everybody's selling you dreams 'round here  
But no one's buying and it's closing time  
Light the fuse, make your break, there's no time left to waste  
Baby just like freedom, nothin's free  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
  
You wanna start a personal revolution  
What else you gotta do tonight  
  
(No apology)  
No apology (no apology)  
We will not back down (no apology)  
We are not afraid (no apology)  
Not a drop of doubt (no apology)  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies  
(No apology)  
No apology  
(No apology)  
No apology  
Hand in hand across this land  
Our voices shouting out  
No apologies

When she walks when she talks  
She does it just like you  
The way she do everythig,  
She does it just like you  
And Lord knows that she moves so fine  
Those precious lips came and blew my mind  
But I can't love somebody new  
  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
  
Someone's taken my place,  
Baby say it ain't true  
All your friends say you love him,  
Baby say it ain't true  
I close my eyes and I see your face  
Those memories lost that I can't replace  
Of all the crazy things that we do  
  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
  
I was wrong I must have been crazy  
Now I think I'm goin' out of my mind  
These thoughts of you are driving me crazy  
A girl like you is so hard to find  
  
When she walks when she talks  
She does it just like you  
The way she do everything,  
She does it just like you  
And Lord knows that she moves so fine  
Those precious lips came and blew my mind  
But I can't love somebody new  
  
I try to find a girl to treat me right  
I take a different one home every night  
But no one makes my dreams come true  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you  
No one does it like you

When you're afraid and it feels like you're too tired to fight  
Even if your heart don't know if you're still alive  
Man you never felt so alone in this world tonight  
And I, don't you know that I felt the same?  
I've seen the storm I've been through the rain  
You gotta know That I feel your pain  
Don't be afraid  
When you're on the edge, I will rescue you  
When you need a friend, I'll be there for you  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I'd lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, baby dream on me  
You can bleed on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
But out on these streets  
They're waiting for blind eyes to see  
They're waiting for our cuts to bleed  
I hear they're waiting for you and me  
Well alright, alright  
Cause this time  
You know I ain't afraid to fight  
For you I ain't afraid to die  
As long as you are by my side  
It will be alright  
When all faith is gone, I will pray for you  
Just keep holding on, I'll be there for you  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, baby bleed on me  
Baby dream on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
I'm nobody's hero  
But for you I lay down my life  
Nobody's hero  
But I'd tear down the stars from the sky  
If you would lean on me, you can bleed on me  
Baby dream on me, just believe in me  
Nobody's hero  
  
Baby, lean on me, you can dream on me  
Just bleed on me, just believe in me

Bless me father I have sinned  
I'm not sure where to begin  
I won't name names or where I've been  
But I've been there and back again  
No Hail Marys will save me  
You learned to live with memories  
Here, slip this sinner up your sleeve  
Just stay inside until I leave  
  
I've been running, always running  
Never have both feet on the floor  
I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running any more  
  
The hands of time they tick no more  
Let darkness fall upon this door  
No waves to wash up on this shore  
I won the fight but lost the war  
  
I've been running, always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
And I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running anymore  
  
There were those who I have loved  
Who've given all and given up  
I pushed your patience and my luck  
It wasn't love I didn't trust  
It wasn't you, or me, or us  
You've shouldered ifs, and ands, and buts  
It's not that way okay, I've said too much  
But I've been running, always running  
Never had both feet on the floor  
I've been running, always running  
Now I ain't running anymore

We've been through this all before a thousand times  
Come on, come on, come on, tell me what's on your mind  
Doesn't matter, baby, what I say  
It all amounts to nothing anyway  
  
When push comes to shove, it's never enough  
It always comes down to something  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's a lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
(All that's ever left is nothing)  
  
I thought I saw you reach out, thought I saw you try  
Waiting here for something, nothing is all I find  
Kneeling at your altar, standing on the shore  
I'm waiting out, now listen, I'm outside your door  
  
When push comes to shove, it's never enough  
It always comes down to something  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's a lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
  
I won't give up  
I won't give up... no  
'Cause you know I won't let you down  
  
How could I live? Why would I try?  
I could learn to live without you but I would die  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
Why would I try?  
I've been learning to live without you but that's lot  
No giving in or saying goodbye  
Seems there's always something but all that's ever left is nothing  
  
I won't give up  
I won't give up... no  
'Cause you know I won't let you down  
You know I won't let you down  
You know I won't let you down

It's been a long time, baby, how've you been,  
But it sure feels good to see you again, my friend.  
I still remember just like yesterdays  
Though the miles and the smiles roll on, they won't fade away  
And it hurts just like hell to let go, but I know  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever  
  
I still remember when you didn't know my name.  
We were lost on the road but you made it my home just the same,  
God I wanna say that you gotta hold on when we go our separate ways  
  
But when your radio's on, you're hearing this song  
I hope that you say nothing's changed  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever  
  
Kings will be kings with crowns to defend  
But I'm just one man and I can't pretend  
A heart's just a heart and songs have to end  
Now dreams will be dreams and friends will be friends  
Now and forever, now and forever.

You look like shit so dear my brother  
I missed you too, yeah you dumb stupid mother  
Jeep, welcome home sign, a bottle of red  
At least you got freedom in an open out there  
Free cheers till the best of the rest we got left  
  
If you could dream anything, what would that be?  
If you could dream back, would you share it with me?  
We carry our choices, we hide our regrets  
We know there's a price, we'll both pay our debts  
But maybe they ain't seen the last of us yet  
  
'Cause old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
There's a face in the mirror, but it don't look like me  
Yesterday's gone, a rain drop in the sea  
I have your back for each day that's gone by  
And I'll still have it till the day that I die  
Yeah, I'll still have it till the day that I die  
  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
And old habits die hard  
  
Some day you'll be missed by those you leave behind  
And I hope you touched other lives like you've touched mine  
Old habits die hard  
Old habits die hard  
It might be painful to smile  
But it covers the scars  
Appearances change but don't change who we are  
And old habits die hard

(sambora, foster, morolda)  
  
All alone in the dark  
No walls no windows  
Trying hard to define  
Heaven from hell  
Standing out in the rain  
With just one shadow  
Nothing to see or believe  
Beyond myself  
See my life going by  
Each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
All alone with my fears  
No words are spoken  
A story yet to be told  
Locked in my mind  
Hope is somewhere ahead  
Shining brightly  
But the past is always following close behind  
See my life going by, each moment I am alive  
I keep reaching out, holding on, hoping  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
I feel it like my heart beating inside  
Somewhere in my life  
Theres one light burning  
Leading the way, leading the way
