I couldn't see  
I couldn't hear  
Shut me off when you were near  
Like a cloud  
A dusty mirror  
Disappear, you disappear  
  
All of a sudden  
All alone  
I'm calling out  
I'm calling love's gonna let me know  
Like the day you took me home  
We counted every minute left to go  
My love's gonna let you know  
  
Time without you drags me down  
It all feels right with you around  
It all feels light with you around  
Like that night we hit the ground  
And all the lightning sends a chill  
Can't forget about you still  
All of a sudden all alone  
I'm calling out  
I'm calling  
  
Love's gonna let me know  
Like the day you took me home  
We counted every minute left to go  
My love's gonna let you know  
  
Calling love's gonna let me know  
Like the day you took me home  
We counted every minute left to go  
My love's gonna let you know  
  
I'm calling out I'm calling  
I'm calling out I'm calling  
I'm calling out I'm calling  
I'm calling out I'm calling  
I'm calling out I'm calling out

Patience, shadow. While you're sick, there's no sight to see.  
Little shadow, little shadow.  
To the night, will you follow me?  
Pardon, shadow, hold on tight to your darkened key.  
Little shadow, little shadow.  
To the night, will you follow me?  
  
Closer, shadow, volume strikes, still we're cut free  
of this song, little shadow  
To the night, will you follow me?  
Hey, shadow, stars, break of dawn, take a turn for stars, to my fantasy  
Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?  
Little shadow, to the night, will you follow me?

The girl who tamed the tiger, yeah yeah  
The heart of southern lovebirds  
They found her under the sea  
She said she came from cell block three  
  
The girl hit hot like a barracuda baby  
She floated on air like a crest of wave  
She was a primal institution  
She was a danger to herself, yeah

I was feeling sad  
Can't help looking back  
Highways flew by  
Run, run, run away  
No sense of time  
Want you to stay  
Want keep you inside  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Run, run, run away  
Lost, lost, lost my mind  
Want you to stay  
Want you to be my prize  
  
I was feeling sad  
Can't help looking back  
Highways flew by  
Run, run, run away  
No sense of time  
Want you to stay  
Want keep you inside  
  
All along, not so strong without these open arms.  
Hold on tight.  
All along, not that strong without these open arms.  
Lie beside.  
All along, not so strong without these open arms.  
Ride beside.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

Checked my glove for the cash  
It was all for the one, for the one  
Slept my baby through it all  
Checked my door for the crash  
Shut like the first, you shut the last  
I won, I won, slept my baby through it all  
I want out, I want out  
I want out, I want out  
Drop, drop down a floor  
Shoot, shoot out your mouth  
These days are scraped from ceilings  
Drop, drop down a floor  
Shoot, shoot out your mouth  
These days are scraped from ceilings  
I want out, well, I want  
Checked my glove for the cash  
It was all for the one, for the one  
Slept my baby through it all  
Checked my door for the crash  
Shut like the first, you shut the last  
I won, I won, slept my baby through it all

I know, what I know, I know  
On the car ride down  
I hear it in my head real low  
Turn into  
The only thing I ever--  
Turn into  
Hope I do  
Turn into you  
  
I know, what I know, I know  
That girl you found  
Keeps that kind of window closed  
She'll turn into  
The only thing you ever--  
Turn into  
Hope I do  
Turn into you  
  
Can't say why I kept this from you  
My those quiet eyes become you  
Leave it where it can't remind us  
Turn this all around behind us  
Oh! Well I know!  
I'll fall right in to keep you out  
I'd like to tell you all about it  
  
I know, what I know, I know  
This last time around  
I'll hear it in my head real low  
Turn into  
The only thing you ever know  
  
I know, what I know, I know  
Ah yes.

Lies and love  
Lies, love  
Bed wetting son of the great heat  
It's all over me  
It's all under me  
The face ain't making what the mouth needs  
  
Wonder more  
Want, more  
Than we did before  
Try the new tease  
Well, quiet you  
Get over me  
The shit is running and it runs deep  
  
I'm way out  
Way out  
  
When you mean it on the inside you still can't to me  
  
Fits around me so tight, nuh oh  
Fits around me  
  
I'm way out  
Way out  
  
When you mean it on the inside you still can't to me

With every breath I breathe  
I'm making history  
With your name on my lips  
The ages fall to bits  
  
In flames I sleep soundly  
With angels around me  
I lay at your feet  
You're the breath that I breathe  
  
Some kind of violent bliss  
Led me to love like this  
One thousand deaths my dear  
I'd die without you here  
  
In flames I sleep soundly  
With angels around me  
I lay at your feet  
You're the breath that I breathe  
  
You're the breath that I breathe  
The breath that I breathe  
Breath that I breathe  
You're the breath that I breathe

Oh so all my lovin' go's  
Under the fog fog fog  
And I will leave them all  
Well I'm just a poor little baby  
Cause well I believe them all

Under the gun gun gun  
And I believe them all  
Well I'm just one poor baby  
Cause well I believe them all  
  
[Pre-chorus]  
I wish I could buy back  
The woman you stole

Out of control, out of control  
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners  
Out of control, high control  
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners  
Out of control, out of control  
You walk, walk, walk, walk, walk my winners out

Makes me feel like a madman on the run  
Find me never never far gone  
So get your leather, leather  
Leather on on on on  
  
[Chorus]  
Your zero  
What's your name?  
No one's gonna ask you  
Better find out where they want you to go  
Try and hit the spot  
Get to know it in the dark  
Get to know it whether you're  
Crying, crying, crying oh oh  
Can you climb, climb, climb higher  
  
Shake it like a ladder to the sun  
Makes me feel like a madman on the run  
Now you're never, never far gone  
So get your leather leather  
Leather on on on on
