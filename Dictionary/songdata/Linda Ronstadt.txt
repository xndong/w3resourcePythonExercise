Well I woke up this morning woah-oh  
And the sun refused to shine  
I knew I'd leave my baby oh  
With a troublin' mind  
It rains every morning oh  
And evening is the same  
And it's gonna be a long time oh  
'Til I hear the 2:10 train  
  
Well I looked out my window oh  
And I couldn't keep from cryin'  
I knew the old 2:10 oh  
Would take me down the line  
That driver on that engine oh  
Well he ain't no friend of mine  
He's taken all the women oh  
And he's left the men behind  
  
Well now he won't be leaving Big Ben oh  
For another seven years  
I'm gonna find another baby oh  
To laugh away my tears  
When I get back to Houston woah-oh  
I'm gonna shout and tell  
How the Big Ben bought 'em oh  
It's a living burning hell  
  
Now when your lovin' baby leaves you oh  
Don't you feel so bad  
It makes you think about the good times oh  
With the one time man you've had  
He's crying don't leave me here baby  
Shackled to a chain  
But let me ride down with you oh  
Along the 2:10 train

How many times have I read farewell lines  
In the things that you never seemed to say?  
How many times have I read those last lines  
And wondered why it ended this way?  
Words of goodbye and all those loving lines  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time  
How you would write about the bright lights  
And your words always clouded up my eyes  
How you would write about the bright lights  
It's a wonder that I never realized  
Our race was run now and another's just begun  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time  
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought  
How they came in the flood of memories  
When your letters stopped the tears that I fought  
How they ran like the rivers to the seas  
Each sunny day, you slip further away  
I must have been blind  
And it seems to me a shame that the number and the name  
Both have changed with the passing of time  

I crossed on the river  
There'll be no returning  
I crossed all the bridges  
I watched them all burning  
And now I'm a stranger  
To a strange land I'm driven  
Where all is forgotten  
And nothing's forgiven  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
I think of him now  
On the road I am taking  
And wonder how long  
His heart will be breaking  
But he'll never hear when  
The teardrops are falling  
Or the sound of my voice  
Or the name I am calling  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
  
So weep for the sons  
And the dear darling daughters  
For the passing of time  
And the parting of waters  
For all who have passed through  
This world long before me  
To a far distant shore line  
Where no one waits for me  
  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  
That's deeper and wider  
Than I'll ever swim  
The heart it will harden  
The sorrow will dim  
But I cried a river  
A river for him  

Adieu false heart, now we must part  
May the joys of the world go with you  
I love you long with a faithful heart  
But never anymore can I believe you  
  
I seen the time I'd married you  
And been your constant lover  
But now I'd gladly give you up  
For one whose heart is truer  
  
You think you are too good for me  
You think I am forsaken  
But if you think I care for you  
You are very much mistaken  
  
My mind is like the constant sun  
From the east to the west it ranges  
But yours is like unto the moon  
It's every month, it changes  
  
When I lay down to take my rest  
No scornful one to wake me  
I'll go straight way unto my grave  
Just as fast as time can take me  
  
Adieu false heart, now we must part  
May the joys of the world go with you  
I love you long with a faithful heart  
But never anymore can I believe you

Ran away from home when I was seventeen  
To be with you  
On the California coast  
  
Drinking margaritas all night in the old cantina  
Out on the California coast  
  
Don't think that I'm ungrateful  
And don't look so morose  
Adios  
Adios  
  
We never really made it baby  
But we came pretty close  
Adios adios  
  
Going up north where the hills are winter green  
I have to leave you  
On the California coast  
  
Going where the water's clear and the air is cleaner  
Than the California coast  
  
Our dreams of endless summer  
Were just too grandiose  
Adios  
Adios  
  
And I miss the blood red sunset  
But I miss you the most  
Adios adios  
Adios  
Adios  
Adios adios

Well I dreamed I saw the knights in armor coming  
Sayin' something about a queen  
There were peasants singing and drummers drumming  
And the archer split the tree  
  
There was a fanfare blowing to the sun  
There was floating on the breeze  
  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the twentieth century  
Look at Mother Nature on the run  
In the twentieth century  
  
I was lying in a burned out basement  
With the full moon in my eyes  
I was hoping for replacement  
When the sun burst through the sky  
  
There was a band playing in my head  
And I felt like I could cry  
  
I was thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
Thinking about what a friend had said  
I was hoping it was a lie  
  
I dreamed I saw the silver spaceships flying  
In the yellow haze of the sun  
There were children crying and colors flying  
All around the chosen ones  
  
All in a dream, all in a dream  
The loading had begun  
  
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed  
To a new home in the sun  
Flying Mother Nature's silver seed  
To a new home

All I left behind should come as no surprise  
To me since I fell through the black hole of your eye  
Only little things inconsequential I could say  
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway  
Silver earrings in Wichita  
Beaded moccasins in Tonapah  
  
But I had you, so  
I just let them go  
The flannel shirt I wore to keep me from the cold  
When we drove from Boston all the way to Buffalo  
The leather boots I bought so many miles ago  
I took them off to follow you into the Ohio  
Never did my armor feel so thin  
  
Silk was all I had between me and your skin  
Like Waterloo, I lost that too  
And the gold bracelet with my father's name inscribed  
On the back by the one who loved him all her life  
The way I too could have loved you  
The Spanish shawl I put across the broken shade  
Of the lamp that lit the room  
  
That last night near Cour d'Alene  
Only little things inconsequential I could say  
Of all I left behind with you along the lost highway  
Of all I left behind

Am I really here in your arms  
Its just like I dreamed it would be  
I feel like we're frozen in time  
And you're the only one I can see  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life  
  
And I never really knew how to love  
I just hoped somehow I'd see  
Asked for a little help from above  
Send that angel down to me  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life  
  
I never thought that I could feel a love so tender  
I never thought I could let those feelings show  
But now my heart is on my sleeve  
and this love will never leave  
I know  
I know  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life  
All my Life  
  
Hey, I've looked All my Life for you  
And now you're here  
Hey, I've spent All my Life with you  
All my Life

The rain doesn't fall on me any more  
The sun doesn't feel as warm as before  
Stars seem far away and fading from sight  
All the beautiful things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now  
  
Close talks, long walks taken with friends  
Getting dirty playing with the neighborhood kids  
Waking up early to see the sun rise  
All the meaningful things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now  
  
Song birds, summer words in my ear  
The fingers of the wind brushing my hair  
The mold on the leaves as they die each year  
The magical things in my life  
They're all gone, all gone, all gone now

Am I blue, am I blue?  
Ain't these tears in my eyes telling you?  
Am I blue? You would be too  
If each plan with your man just fell through  
  
Was a time, I was his only one  
Now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Ooh, was I gay till today?  
Now he's gone and we're through, am I blue?  
  
Was a time I was the only one  
Now I'm the sad and lonely one  
Ooh, was I gay till today?  
Now he's gone and we're through, am I blue, am I blue?  
  
Ooh ho, am I blue?

It's just like heaven  
Being here with you  
You're like an angel  
Too good to be true  
But after all I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
When you are near me  
My heart skips a beat  
I can hardly stand on  
My own two feet  
Because I love you I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
Ooh I love you, ooh I do  
No one could love you like I do  
Oh  
Oh Oh Oh  
Please never leave me  
Blue and alone  
If you ever go  
I'm sure you'll come back home  
Because I love you I love you I do  
Angel baby, my angel baby  
Ooh I love you, ooh I do  
No one can love you like I do  
Oh  
Oh Oh Oh

Anyone who ever loved could look at me  
And know that I love you  
Amyone who ever dreamed could look at me  
And know I dream of you  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me  
Like you hurt me and be so untrue  
What am I to do  
  
Every time you go away I always say  
This time it's goodbye dear  
Loving you the way I do I'd take you back  
Without you I'd die dear  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me  
Like you hurt me and be so untrue  
What am I to do  
  
Knowing I love you so  
Anyone who had a heart  
Would take me in his arms and love me too  
You couldn't really have a heart and hurt me  
Like you hurt me and be so untrue  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you, yeah  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too  
Anyone who had a heart would surely take me  
In his arms and always love me  
Why won't you  
Yeah  
Anyone who had a heart would love me too

Soon now  
I'm gonna tell the people in the streets  
And set 'em dancin'  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I'm in love  
Soon now I'm gonna write a letter home  
And tell my mother  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I'm in love  
  
I'm in love with you  
And the world is new  
It feels so good to be alive  
I'm in love I can't keep the news inside  
Soon now I'm gonna go walkin' through the trees  
And talkin' to the flowers  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I'm in love  
  
All of my life I was lonely  
Nobody cared  
Nobody loved me  
Now that you're here  
I'm always happy happy happy  
Soon now I'm gonna tell all of my friends  
And they'll go party  
Soon now I'm gonna tell the whole world  
I mean the whole world  
I mean the whole world  
I'm in love

Lover, there will be another one  
To hover over you beneath the sun  
Tomorrow see the things that never come today  
  
When you see me fly away without you  
Shadow on the things you know  
Feathers fall around you  
And show you the way to go  
It's over  
It's over  
  
Nestle in your wings my little one  
A special morning brings another sun  
Tomorrow see the things that never come today  
  
When you see me fly away without you  
Shadow on the things you know  
Feathers fall around you and show you the way to go  
It's over  
It's over

Let me cry, let me sigh when I'm blue,  
Let me go away from this lonesome town,  
Won't be long till my song here is through,  
And I know I'm on my last go round.  
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow  
Couldn't heal all this pain in my soul.  
What is love but a prelude to sorrow  
With a heartbreak ahead as your goal.  
Here I go  
Now you know why I'm leaving.  
I got the blues.  
What can I lose?  
Goodbye!  
All the love I could steal, beg or borrow  
Couldn't heal all this pain in my soul.  
What is love but a prelude to sorrow  
With a heartbreak ahead as your goal.  
Here I go  
Now you know why I'm leaving.  
I got the blues.  
What can I lose?  
Goodbye!  
Adieu! to you  
Goodbye!  

Baby oh baby  
Tell the man at the ticket stand that you've changed your mind  
Well let me run on out and tell the cab to keep his meter flying  
Cause if you say goodbye to me babe you're gonna break my mind  
  
Break my mind  
Break my mind  
Well I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine  
Break my mind  
Break my mind oh lord  
Well if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind  
  
Baby oh baby  
Well let me take your suitcase off of that scale in time  
Just tell the man that you suddenly developed a thing about high flying  
Cause if you say goodbye to me you know you're gonna break my mind  
  
Break my mind  
Break my mind  
Well I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine  
Break my mind  
Break my mind oh lord  
Well if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind  
  
Break my mind  
Break my mind  
Well I just can't stand to hear the big jet engines whine  
Break my mind  
Break my mind oh lord  
Well if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind  
Well if you leave you're gonna leave a babbling fool behind

Old man sunshine listen you  
Never tell me dreams come true  
Just try it and I'll start a riot  
Beatrice Fairfax don't you dare  
Ever tell me he will care  
I'm certain it's the final curtain  
I never want to hear from any cheerful Pollyannas  
Who tell you fate supplies a mate  
It's all bananas  
  
They're writing songs of love but not for me  
A lucky star's above but not for me  
With love to lead the way I've found more clouds of gray  
Than any Russian play could guarantee  
  
I was a fool to fall and get that way  
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day  
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me  
  
I was a fool to fall and get that way  
Hi-ho, alas, and also lack-a-day  
Although I can't dismiss the memory of his kiss  
I guess he's not for me

You're in deeper than you seem  
What you need, what you want  
Are not the same thing  
I think you're getting sick on the dream  
  
I don't want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please don't make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
You told me that we could make it right  
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight  
Do you think forevers only last all night  
  
I don't want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please don't make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
First it's promises then it's lies  
Watch those stares turn to turned-away eyes  
  
You told me that we could make it right  
Underneath the fear that you would hold me tight  
Do you think forevers only last all night  
I don't want to see you  
Till you know the cost of love  
Please don't make me need you  
Till you know the cost of love  
  
Till you know the cost  
Of love  

Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And a storm is brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that's it real  
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
That's why I'm lonely all the time  
  
Please take these treasured dreams I had for you and me  
And take all the love I thought was mine  
Someday my crazy arms will hold somebody new  
But right now I'm so lonesome I could die  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed  
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine  
Well you're someone else's love now, you're not mine

Now blue ain't the word for the way that I feel  
And a storm is brewing in this heart of mine  
This ain't no crazy dream I know that's it real  
You're someone else's love now, you're not mine  
  
Crazy arms that reach to hold somebody new  
But my yearning heart keeps saying you're not mine  
My troubled mind knows soon to another you'll be wed

I say I'll move the mountains  
And I'll move the mountains  
If he wants them out of the way  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure I'm crazy  
Crazy in love I'd say  
I say I'll go through fire  
And I'll go through fire  
As he wants it so it shall be  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure I'm crazy  
Crazy in love you see  
Like the wind that shakes the bough  
He moves me with a smile  
The difficult I'll do right now  
The impossible will take a little while  
I say I'll care forever  
And I mean forever  
If I have to hold up the sky  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure I'm crazy  
Crazy in love am I  
Like the wind that shakes the bough  
He moves me with a smile  
The difficult I'll do right now  
The impossible will take a little while  
I say I'll care forever  
And I mean forever  
If I have to hold up the sky  
Crazy he calls me  
Sure I'm crazy  
Crazy in love am I

Life isn't easy  
Love never lasts  
You just carry on  
And keep moving fast  
  
I pulled off the highway  
And rolled into town  
I'm just fancy free babe  
And I travel 'round  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes down  
Where can I run to  
How have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
  
And my thoughts are filled with memories  
They won't let me be  
But if all the stars are shining bright  
Well they would not let me see  
  
It's so cold and the rain keeps blowing  
It's tearing through the town  
But I'm still fancy free darling  
And I travel 'round  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Sometimes down  
Oh where can I run to  
How have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
  
Sometimes I'm up  
Most times down  
Oh where can I run to  
Tell me how have I sinned  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
  
Who can I turn to  
Tell me where to begin  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind  
When you cry like a rainstorm  
And you howl like the wind

Now you say you're lonely  
You cried the whole night through  
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
Now you say you're sorry  
For being so untrue  
Well you can cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shed a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
Told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me and  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well just to prove you do  
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
You drove me, nearly drove me out of my head  
While you never shared a tear  
Remember, I remember all that you said  
Told me love was too plebeian  
Told me you were through with me and  
  
Now you say you love me  
Well just to prove you do  
Come on and cry me a river, cry me a river  
I cried a river over you  
  
I cried a river over you  
I cried a river over you

Here it is again  
Friday night  
Everyone is laughing  
Carrying on  
  
Going out  
Having a ball  
But I stay at home  
Waiting by a phone that never rings  
  
Surrounded by memories and all your things  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
'Til my tears run dry  
I know that you're out  
Having fun  
  
Cheatin' on me  
Telling pretty lies  
Making her promises now  
You don't think of me  
  
You don't care about what's happening here  
Every time you kiss her I cry a tear  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
'Til my tears run dry  
You don't think of me  
  
You don't care about what's happening here  
Every time you kiss her I cry a tear  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
  
Yes I'm gonna cry  
Oh yes I'm gonna cry  
'Til my tears run dry  
Yes I yes I'm gonna cry

Something in your eyes makes me want to lose myself  
Makes me want to lose myself in your arms  
There's something in your voice makes my heart beat fast  
Hope this feeling lasts the rest of my life  
If you knew how lonely my life has been  
And how long I've felt so low  
If you knew how I wanted someone to come along  
And change my life the way you've done  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
A window breaks down a long dark street  
And a siren wails in the night  
But I'm alright cause I have you here with me  
And I can almost see through the dark there's light  
If you knew how much this moment means to me  
And how long I've waited for your touch  
If you know how happy you are making me  
I've never thought I'd love anyone so much  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I come from  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like home to me  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong  
Feels like I'm all the way back where I belong

(Gilberto Parra)  
  
For a love  
I can't sleep and I live full of passion  
I have a love  
That left forever in my life a bitter pain  
  
Poor me  
This life would be better if it would end  
It's not for me.  
  
Poor me (Ay, my heart...  
Poor me (don't suffer any more...  
How much my suffering in my breast  
That throbs so alone for you.  
  
For a love  
I have cried little drops of blood from my heart,  
You have left me with a wounded soul  
Without compassion...

Want love? Get closer  
You want love? Get closer  
Hold her hand, be forward  
Come on, be a man, get closer  
Instead of worrying about those things you said  
Follow your heart and forget your head  
Maybe some things will jump out your mouth  
Make her notice that you're crazy about her  
You want love? Get closer  
You want love? Get closer  
You make a fuss when her eyes ain't on you  
Well, give her something to look forward to  
Remember all those other girls who ran  
Away from something they didn't understand  
You want love? Get closer  
You want love? Get closer  
Why you worrying about those things you said  
Follow your heart and forget your head  
Oh, slide over on the seat  
She'll give you something that's, oh so sweet  

There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder  
Thought I heard you mention my name can't you talk any louder  
Don't come any closer  
Don't come any nearer  
My vision of you can't come any clearer  
Oh I just wanna hear girls talk  
  
Got a loaded imagination being fired by girls talk  
It's a more or less situation inspired by girls talk  
But I can't say the words you want to hear  
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear right here and now  
  
Girls talk  
And they wanna know how girls talk  
And they say it's not allowed girls talk  
If they say that it's so don't they think that I know by now  
That the word up on everyone's lips stick that you're dedicated  
You may not be an old fashioned girl but you're gonna get dated  
Was it really murder were you just pretending  
Lately I have heard you are the living end  
  
Girls talk  
And they wanna know how girls talk  
And they say it's not allowed girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
if they say that it's so don't they think that I know by now  
  
But I can't say the words you want to hear  
I suppose you're gonna have to play it by ear right here  
There are some things you can't cover up with lipstick and powder  
Thought I heard you mention my name can't you talk any louder  
Don't come any closer  
Don't come any nearer  
My vision of you can't come any clearer  
Girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
And they say it's not allowed girls talk  
And they think they know how girls talk  
Girls talk, girls talk  
  

Love I am told is the deepest mystery  
Harder to fathom than any sea  
More precious than all the earth and sky  
But nobody can tell you why  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you  
If it is love for which you've cried  
You know how it feels on moon's dark side  
If your baby love's you right  
You can have skyrockets any old night  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you  
And you can't stop saying it  
I love you  
Can't stop saying it  
I love you  
Keep on saying it saying it  
I won't stop until you say it too  
Love can be gentle soft and tame  
Or so rough you wouldn't know its name  
Shy and wild like a runaway child  
Storms of love always end up mild  
Give one heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
You get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you  
Give your heart  
Get back two  
That's the paradox of I love you  
So when you give your heart  
Get one too  
That's the paradox of I love you

Go away from my window  
Go away from my door  
Go away from my bedside  
And bother me no more  
And bother me no more  
  
I'll go and tell my brothers  
I'll tell my sister too  
The reason why my heart is broke  
Is on account of you  
Is on account of you  
  
I'll give you back your letters  
I'll give you back your ring  
But I'll never forget my own true love  
As long as songbirds sing  
As long as songbirds sing  
  
Go away from my window  
Go away from my door  
Go away way way from my beside  
And bother me no more  
And bother me no more

Now it's time to say goodnight  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the sun turns out his light  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Dream sweet dreams for me  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the moon begins to shine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Dream sweet dreams for me  
Close your eyes and I'll close mine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Now the moon begins to shine  
Goodnight, sleep tight  
Dream sweet dreams for you  
Dream sweet dreams for me  
Goodnight  
Goodnight baby

She tells him she thinks she wants to be free  
He tells her he doesn't understand  
She takes his hand  
And tells him nothing's working out the way she planned  
  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
He's hanging on to half a heart  
But he can't have the restless part  
  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind  
Now he agrees he thinks she ought to be free  
Now she says she'd rather be with him  
Oh it's just a whim  
  
That she's designed to keep him out there on that limb  
She's so many women  
He can't find the one who was his friend  
He hanging on to half a heart  
  
But he can't have the restless part  
So he tells her to hasten down the wind  
He tells her to hasten down the wind  
He tells her to hasten down the wind

Whenever I'm with him  
Something inside starts to burning  
And I'm filled with desire  
  
Could it be the devil in me  
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart  
  
Whenever he calls my name  
Soft, low, sweet and plain, I feel, yeah yeah  
Well I feel that burning flame  
  
Has high blood pressure got a hold on me  
Or is this the way love's supposed to be?  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart  
  
Sometimes I stare into space  
Tears all over my face  
I can't explain it don't understand it  
I hadn't ever felt like this before  
  
Now that funny feeling has me amazed  
I don't know what to do my head's in a haze  
  
It's like a heat wave  
Burning in my heart  
Can't keep from crying  
It's tearing me apart  
  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah, oh oh  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, oh  
  
Don't pass up this chance  
This time it's true romance  
  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Heat wave  
Ooh, heat wave

Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song  
Well, I'll cry everytime that you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one, one more time  
  
Southern California that's as blue as the boy can be  
Blue as the deep blue sea  
Won't you listen to me now  
I need your golden gated cities like a hole in the head  
Just like a hole in the head, I'm free  
  
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song  
Well, I'll cry everytime that you slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one, one more time  
  
I do believe I'm headed home  
Hey mister, can't you see that I'm as dry as a bone  
I think I'll spend some time alone  
Yes, unless you've found a way of squeezing water from a stone  
  
Let the doctor and the lawyer do as much as they can  
Let the springtime begin  
Let the boy become a man  
I done wasted too much time just to sing you this sad song  
I done been this lonesome picker a little too long  
  
Hey mister, that's me up on the jukebox  
I'm the one that's singing this sad song  
Well, I'll cry everytime that you're up and slip in one more dime  
And let the boy sing the sad one, one more time  
  
Well, I've been spreading myself thin these days  
Don't you know  
Good-bye

I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
The way I feel, can't explain  
So much passion turned to pain  
The sun still shines most of the time  
Did you know the sun shines when it rains  
  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
  
I've been cussed and I've been praised  
And I've been nothing these days  
But I'll come back, time will see  
If I'm wrong about you, right about me  
  
I've been higher than the high sierra  
Lower than Death Valley must be  
I've been right, mostly wrong  
Wrong about you, right about me  
Wrong about you, right about me  
Wrong about you, right about me

I lit my purest candle close to my window  
Hoping it would catch the eye  
Of any vagabond that passed it by  
And I waited in my lonely house  
  
Before he came I felt him drawing near  
And as he neared I felt the ancient fear  
That he had come to my door and jeer  
And I waited in my fleeting house  
  
Tell me stories, I called to the hobo  
Stories of old, I smiled to the hobo  
Storie of cold, I wept to the hobo  
As he stood before my fleeting house  
  
No, said the hobo, no more tales of time  
Don't ask me now to wash away the grime  
I can't come in for it's too high a climb  
And he walked away from my lonely house  
  
Then you be damned I screamed to the hobo  
Turn into stone I cried to the hobo  
Leave me alone I knelt to the hobo  
And he walked away from my fleeting house  
  
I lit my purest candle close to my window  
Hoping it would catch the eye  
Of any vagabond who passed it by  
And I waited in my fleeting house

You're a doll  
Your eyes see all  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
want to see me?  
  
You're so young  
But your feelings are deep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you feel for me  
  
You put your head on my pillow  
And you're fast asleep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Dream about me?  
  
Ooh, ooh, baby  
The world's a wall of ice  
You're gonna need someone  
To treat you warm  
And keep you nice  
  
I like the way you dance  
The way you spin  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Spin for me?  
  
You put your head on my pillow  
And you're fast asleep  
And how do I make you  
How do I make you  
How do I make you  
Dream about me?  
Dream about me?

I'm a singer of love songs  
Songs that are happy and gay  
But how can I sing my love songs  
My lover's gone away  
  
I got the words  
I got the tune  
I've been rehearsing under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
I've got the place  
I've got the time  
I've got a lot of love words that rhyme  
  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Mmm mmm  
I guess it just had to be  
Mmm mmm  
  
Won't someone listen to me  
I got the words and I got the tune  
I'd like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Well I got the words and I got the tune  
And I'd like to croon it under the moon  
But I got nobody to hear my song  
  
So I'm hummin' to myself  
Mmm, hummin' to myself  
Well I'm hummin' to myself  
I'm hummin' to myself

I know you  
Don't know what I'm going through  
Standing here looking at you  
  
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad  
It makes me feel so sad  
It makes me hurt so bad to see you again  
  
Like needles and pins  
People say "you've been making out okay  
He's in love don't stand in his way"  
  
Well let me tell you that it hurts so bad  
It makes me feel so sad  
It's gonna hurt so bad if you walk away  
Click here to listen  
Why don't you stay and let me make it up to you  
I'll do anything you want me to  
You loved me before please love me again  
I can't let you go back to her  
Please don't go  
Please don't go  
  
Please don't go  
Please don't go  
Hurt so bad  
Come back it hurts so bad  
Don't make it hurt so bad  
I'm begging you please  
  
Oooooh oh oh oh  
Come back it hurts so bad  
Come back it hurts so bad  
I'm begging you please  
Oh! No!  
Noooooo!

Now that you find yourself losing your mind  
Are you here again  
Finding that what you once thought was real  
Is gone and changing  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day  
How can I place you above me  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you  
  
Coming to you at night I see my questions  
I feel wiped out  
Wishing that maybe in a year or two  
We can laugh and let it all out  
  
Now that you made yourself love me  
Do you think I can change it in a day  
How can I place you above me  
Am I lying to you when I say  
That I believe in you  
O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you  
O-oh, O-oh, O-oh I believe in you

I've been tryin' for a long, long time  
But no matter what I do  
When I turn to leave, my heart stays behind  
'Cause I can't get over you  
  
I keep movin' on, runnin' hard and fast  
But everywhere that I run to  
I'm just standin' still, living in the past  
'Cause I can't get over you  
  
If memories were like the leaves that fall  
The wind would have carried them from my mind  
The seasons pass, but they never change  
A broken heart can't keep time  
  
I've watched as colors faded in the sun  
The colors of my love stay true  
I've been letting go now, I'm not holdin' on  
I just can't get over you  
I just can't get over you

Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say goodbye  
  
Feel so bad baby, oh it hurts me  
When I think of how you love and desert me  
I'm the broken-hearted toy you play with  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
Though I'm just one of your lovers  
And I know there are so many others  
You do something strange to me baby  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
Oh I tried and I tried but I can't say goodbye  
I know that it's wrong and I should be so strong  
But the thought of you gone makes me want to hold on  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
You got me going, I need you baby  
I can't let go and I want you baby  
I gotta have all your love  
I can't let go  
  
I can't let go  
I can't let go  
I can't let go

I need your love so badly, I love you, oh, so madly  
But I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!  
I thought at last I'd found you, but other lovers surround you  
And "I don't stand a ghost of a chance with you!"  
If you'd surrender just for a tender kiss or two  
You might discover, that I'm the lover meant for you  
And I'd be true, but what's the good of scheming  
I know I must be dreaming

I just don't know what to do with myself  
Don't know just what to do with myself  
I'm so used to doing everything with you  
Planning everything for two  
And now that we're through  
I just don't know what to do with my time  
I'm so lonesome for you it's a crime  
Going to a movie only makes me sad  
Parties make me feel as bad  
When I'm not with you  
I just don't know what to do  
Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain  
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
Baby if your new love ever turns you down  
Come back I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I don't know what else to do  
Like a summer rose needs the sun and rain  
I need your sweet love to ease all the pain  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
I don't know just what to do with myself  
Baby if your new love ever turns you down  
Come on back I will be around  
Just waiting for you  
I don't know what else to do  
No no no  
I don't know what else to do  
I'm just so crazy for you  
No no no no  
I don't know what else to do  
I don't know what else to do

Deep down inside  
I know I still love him  
But he'll never know  
Cause I'll never tell  
  
I'll confide that I'm thinking of him  
And wishing him well  
I can't walk up to him and say to him  
  
Baby, what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know, nothing's really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid  
  
Lately I've seen  
That look in his eyes  
That just breaks my heart  
He needs me so  
To lean on at this moment  
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say  
  
Baby, what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know, nothing's really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid  
  
Maybe someday I'll throw off my foolish pride  
This ain't so good  
Watching him die this way  
Cause he's the same guy inside  
Oh why can't I walk up to that old love of mine and say  
  
Baby, what you been doing  
I still love you like I did  
You know, nothing's really changed here  
But being the way I am  
I keep it hid

Yeah yeah ueah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah ye-ah  
I knew you when you were lonely  
I knew you when you were only  
  
A boy all alone without love  
I knew you when  
I knew you when  
You were sad and all alone  
  
You didn't have anyone  
That you could call your own  
I knew you when  
Your heart belonged to only me  
  
But that was many tears ago  
Now your love is just a memory  
Yeah yeah yeah ye-ah  
  
I knew you when you were lonely  
I knew you when you were only  
A boy all alone without love  
  
I knew you when  
I knew you when  
We used to have a lot of fun  
But someone came and offered more  
  
Now I'm the lonely one  
I knew you when  
I was just a scared little girl  
I used to be your only love  
  
Before you came up in the world  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yeah yeah yeah ye-ah  
  
I knew you when you were lonely  
I knew you when you were only  
A boy all alone without love

I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I'll give you my heart  
  
I love you  
And you alone were meant for me  
Please give your loving heart to me  
And say we'll never part  
  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling I'm never lonely  
Whenever you're in sight  
  
I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  
  
I think of you every morning  
Dream of you every night  
Darling I'm never lonely  
Whenever you're in sight  
  
I love you for sentimental reasons  
I hope you do believe me  
I've given you my heart  

Don't need a Rolex or a limousine  
Don't need my picture in a magazine  
Don't need approval of a chosen few  
Tell you what I do need, I need you  
  
Don't need no fixtures, fittings, or phone  
I'm so unfurnished, I'm on my own  
I Don't need reminding when the rent is due  
I tell you what I do need, I need you  
  
I need you like a fly needs a plane  
I need you like a ball needs a game  
I need you like a pool needs a cue  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
  
I Don't need no covered kisses for company  
I Don't want no washed up dishes soft soaping me  
I Don't need no other fella, honey I refuse  
Tell you what I do need, I need you  
  
Oh, I need you like a fly needs a plane  
Oh, I need you like a ball needs a game  
I need you like a shot needs to shoot  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you  
Need you, need you, need you, I need you

Never, never will I marry  
Never, never will I wed  
Born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed, never  
Never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
No conscious, no care, no burdens to bear  
No memories to mourn, no turning  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed  
Never, never, never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
For I was born to wander solitary  
Wide, my world, narrow, my bed  
Never, never will I marry  
Born to wander 'til I'm dead  
Never, never

Darling, been to see the preacher man  
Darling darling, started making wedding plans  
Your lips set my soul on fire  
To be with you that's my one desire  
Oh darling  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
Darling, started getting next to me  
Darling, though about how this could be  
Ooee  
If your love is half as true  
As the love I'm offering you  
Oh darling, I think it's gonna work out fine  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
Know it's gonna work out fine  
Think it's gonna work out fine  
I'm so glad that you're mine all mine  
Do you remember they used to call you Dapper Dan  
Way back when I was the killer and everybody's loving man  
Whole lotta women used to be my speed  
Now pretty baby you're all I need  
Oh darling, think it's gonna work out fine  
He's so, I'm so, we're so glad when we remember  
Used to call me Dapper Dan yeah  
Way back when you were the killer and everybody's loving man  
Whole lotta women used to be my speed  
Now pretty baby you're all I need  
Oh darling, think it's gonna work out fine

You've got to think, think, work out fine  
I think it's gonna work out  
Yeah it's gonna work out

If I should stay  
Well, I would only be in your way  
And so I'll go, but yet I know  
That I'll think of you each step of my way  
And I will always love you  
I will always love you  
Bitter-sweet memories  
  
That's all I have, and all I'm taking with me  
Good-bye, oh, please don't cry  
Cause we both know that I'm not  
What you need  
  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
  
And I hope life, will treat you kind  
And I hope that you have all  
That you ever dreamed of  
Oh, I do wish you joy  
And I wish you happiness  
But above all this  
I wish you love  
I love you, I will always love  
  
I, I will always, always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you  
I will always love you

Written by Eric Kaz  
I've been alone too long  
Sitting by myself  
I'm getting to old  
To help myself  
But I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin round  
To feel the pain  
And if you take my life in hand  
And finally make me understand  
It won't do no good  
You'll just hurt my plan  
And I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin rond  
To feel the pain  
Sometimes I think I can't go on  
And every day I live  
Well it seems like my life's unreal  
Sometimes I think I won't live too long  
But I hope I'm wrong  
That's the way I feel  
And I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin round  
To steal a kiss  
I won't be hanging round your door  
Begging  
No I won't be hangin round  
To feel the pain  
No I won't be hangin round your door  
Begging  
Oh I won't be hangin round  
To feel the pain

They say just once in life  
You find someone that's right  
But the world looks so confused  
I can't tell false from true  
And love's so hard to find  
In this state of mind  
Oh I hope I'll know him  
I hope I'll know him  
If he's ever near  
Well it seemed the time had come  
I thought you were the one  
When I looked into your eyes  
It never looked like lies  
And love's so hard to see  
When it's in front of me  
Oh I hope I'll know it  
I hope I'll know it  
If it's ever near  
And love's so hard to see  
When it's in front of me  
Oh I hope I'll know it  
I hope I'll know it  
If it's ever near  
Well I know that in my time  
I'll have it sweet and fine  
But it won't add up to much  
Unless I feel his touch  
And love's so hard to find  
So I guess I'll just give up trying  
Oh I hope I'll know him  
I hope I'll know him  
If he's ever near

We said we'd walk together baby come what may  
There come the twilight should we lose our way  
If as we're walking hands should slip free  
I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
We swore we'd travel darling side by side  
And we'd help each other stay in stride  
Each lover's steps fall so differently  
So I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Everyone dreams of love lasting and true  
But you and I know what this world can do  
Let's make our steps clear that the other may see  
And I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead  
And there 'neath the oak's bough soon we'll be wed  
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees  
I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darling I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind wait for me  
Darling I'll wait for you  
  

Cathedral bells were tolling  
And our hearts sang on  
Was it the spell of Paris  
Or the April dawn  
Who knows if we shall meet again  
But when the morning chimes ring sweet again  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In all the old familiar places  
That this heart of mine embraces  
  
All day through  
In that small cafe  
The park across the way  
The children's carousel  
The chestnut tree  
The wishing well  
  
I'll be seeing you  
In every lovely summer's day  
In everything that's light and gay  
I'll always think of you that way  
  
I'll find you in the morning sun  
And when the night is new  
I'll be looking at the moon  
But I'll be seeing you

I'm a fool to want you  
I'm a fool to want you  
To want a love that can't be true  
A love that's there for others too  
  
I'm a fool to hold you  
Such a fool to hold you  
To seek a kiss not mine alone  
To share a kiss the devil has known  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
Then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words I'd have to say  
  
I'm a fool to want you  
Pity me, I need you  
I know it's wrong  
It must be wrong  
  
But right or wrong  
I can't get along  
Without you  
  
Time and time again I said I'd leave you  
Time and time again I went away  
Then would come the time when I would need you  
And once again these words I'd have to say  
  
I'm a fool to want you  
Pity me, I need you  
I know it's wrong  
It must be wrong  
  
But right or wrong  
I can't get along  
Without you

Now Matthew was a country boy until one day he found  
That cheatin' folks was easier than plowin' his daddy's ground  
He left his home back in Ohio, bound for Chicago's town  
He crossed Big Jim and turned his back  
  
A bullet cut him down  
And as he lay there dying  
He said "Will I see my Ohio?"  
In my reply I lied a bit  
  
And said I did not know  
Now Jim McCall he was meek and small  
And to become a man  
He'd have to build himself up tall  
  
With fancy folks and land  
He threw some stones at honest friends  
And he got himself these things  
His children left him and he sneered  
  
"That's what my kindness brings"  
And on the south side he got lost  
He asked me where to go  
In my reply I lied a bit  
  
And said I did not know  
Yes Miss Lazy Susan called me up  
She heard I stole the show  
In my reply I lied a bit  
  
And said I did not know  
In my reply I lied a bit and said I did not know

I don't care if there's powder on my nose  
I don't care if my hair-do is in place  
I've lost the very meaning of repose  
I never put a mudpack on my face  
  
Oh who'd have thought that I walk in a daze now  
I never go to shows at night but just to matinees now  
I see the show, and home I go  
Once I laughed when I heard you saying  
  
That I'd be playing solitaire  
Uneasy in my easy chair  
It never entered my mind  
Once you told me I was mistaken  
  
That I'd awaken with the sun  
And order orange juice for one  
It never entered my mind  
You have what I lack myself  
  
And now I even have to scratch my back myself  
Once you warned me that if you scorned me  
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again  
And wish that you were there again  
  
To get into my hair again  
It never entered my mind  
Once you warned me that if you scorned me  
I'd sing the maiden's prayer again  
  
And wish that you were there again  
To get into my hair again  
It never entered my mind  
It never entered my mind

It's so easy to fall in love  
It's so easy to fall in love  
People tell me love's for fools  
Here I go breaking all the rules  
  
Seems so easy  
Yeah, so doggone easy  
Oh it seems so easy  
Yeah where you're concerned  
My heart can learn  
It's so easy to fall in love  
It's so easy to fall in love  
  
Look into your heart and see  
What your lovebook has set aside for me  
  
It seems so easy  
Yeah, so doggone easy  
Oh it seems so easy  
Yeah where you're concerned  
My heart can learn  
Oh it's so easy to fall in love

Oh-ooh It's so easy to fall in love

Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
I want to see what's never been seen  
I want to live that age-old dream  
Come on boy let's go together  
Let's take the best right now  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
I want to go to an old hoedown  
Long ago in a western town  
Pick me up 'cause my feet are dragging  
Give me a lift and I'll hay your wagon  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
Love is a rose but you better not pick it  
Only grows when it's on the vine  
Handful of thorns and you'll know you've missed it  
Lose your love when you say the word mine  
  
Mine  
  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose  
Love is a rose

Well I hope that the friend that you've thrown yourself on  
Gets drunk and loses her job  
And every road that you travel on  
Is dusty rocky and hard  
  
I couldn't make you love me  
You only made me blue  
So all in all if the curtain should fall  
Then I hope that it falls on you  
  
And I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
  
Well I hope that the train from Caribou, Maine  
Runs over your new love affair  
You'll walk the floor from dawn to dawn  
And you'll tear out your peroxide hair  
  
I never was your woman  
Cause you were never true  
So all in all if the curtain should fall  
Then I hope that it falls on you  
  
And I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge  
I will have sweet  
Sweet sweet mental revenge

When the sun comes up and I awake  
I think of you  
When I walk out to meet the day  
I think of you  
When the morning wind is in my face  
I think of you  
And you're on my mind  
On my mind  
And you're on my mind all the time  
  
When the sun gets high and heals the day  
I think of you  
When the air is still and the earth ablaze  
I think of you  
When the shadows stretch and start to fade  
I think of you  
And you're on my mind  
On my mind  
And you're on my mind all the time  
  
When the sun gets low and the day gets cold  
I think of you  
When the evening winds rise up and blow  
I think of you  
In the nights of silver black and gold  
I think of you  
And you're on my mind  
On my mind  
And you're on my mind all the time  
  
When the sun gets low and the day gets cold  
I think of you  
When the evening winds rise up and blow  
I think of you  
In the nights of silver black and gold  
I think of you  
And you're on my mind  
On my mind  
And you're on my mind all the time

Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today, madam.  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
She is sorry to be delayed  
But last evening down at Lover's Lane she strayed, madam.  
  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
When she woke up and found  
That her dream of love had gone, madam,  
She ran to the man  
  
Who had led her so far astray  
And from under her velvet gown  
She drew a gun and shot her lover down.  
Madam, Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
  
When the mob came and got her  
And dragged her from the jail, madam,  
They strung her up  
On the old willow across the way.  
  
And the moment before she died  
She lifted up her lovely head and cried, madam.  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.  
Miss Otis regrets she's unable to lunch today.
