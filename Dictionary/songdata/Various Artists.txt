Above all powers, above all kings  
Above all nature and all created things  
Above all wisdom and all the ways of man  
You were here before the world began  
  
Above all kingdoms, above all thrones  
Above all wonders the world has ever known  
Above all wealth and treasures of the earth  
There's no way to measure what You're worth  
  
Crucified and laid behind the stone  
You lived to die rejected and alone  
Like a rose trampled on the ground  
You took the fall and thought of me above all

Amazing grace! How sweet the sound  
That saved a wretch like me  
I once was lost, but now am found  
Was blind, but now I see  
  
'Twas grace that taught my heart to fear  
And grace my fears relieved  
How precious did that grace appear  
The hour I first believed  
  
Through many dangers, toils and snares  
I have already come  
'Tis grace hath brought me safe thus far  
And grace will lead me home  
  
The Lord has promised good to me  
His word my hope secures  
He will my shield and portion be  
As long as life endures  
  
Yea, when this flesh and heart shall fail  
And mortal life shall cease  
I shall possess within the veil  
A life of joy and peace  
  
When we've been there ten thousand years  
Bright shining as the sun  
We've no less days to sing God's praise  
Than when we've first begun
