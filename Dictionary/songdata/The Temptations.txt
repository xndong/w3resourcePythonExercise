Winds may blow over the icy sea  
I'll take with me the warmth of thee  
A taste of honey  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
I will return  
I'll return  
I'll come back for the honey and you  
  
I'll leave behind my heart to wear  
And may it ever remind you of  
A taste of honey  
A taste much sweeter than wine  
I will return  
I'll return  
I'll come back for the honey and you  
  
He never came back to his love so fair  
And so she died dreaming of his kiss  
His kiss of honey  
A taste more bitter than wine  
I will return  
I will return  
I'll come back for the honey and you  
I'll come back for the honey and you!

I saw the saddest thing, other day.  
When an old man pass my way.  
Walking the streets so all alone.  
All because he had no home.  
  
But the saddest thing I've ever seen,  
Is a tear from a woman's eye.  
A tear from a woman's eye.  
Hmmm  
  
I saw a man, no shoes on his feet.  
But the saddest thing is to see a woman weep.  
A woman is tender thing.  
To see her cry, a sad, sad thing.  
  
Nothing touches me deeper inside,  
Than a tear from a woman's eye.  
A tear from a woman's eye.  
Hmmm  
  
A woman's tears dropping on her cheek,  
Is like a sound of thunder, that loudly it rings.  
'Cause when I see her cry, I know she hurts inside.  
  
Yes, the saddest thing I've ever seen.  
Is a tear from a woman's eye.  
A tear from a woman's eye.  
Hmmm  
  
Sad, sad thing is a tear from a woman's eye.  
A sad, sad thing is to see a woman cry.  
Sad, sad, sad thing is a tear from a woman's eye.  
Sad, sad, sad thing is to see a woman cry.

People moving out,  
People moving in,  
Why, because of the color of their skin,  
Run, run, run, but you just can't hide.  
  
An eye for an eye,  
Tooth for a tooth,  
Vote for me and I'll set you free,  
Rap on, brother, rap on.  
  
Well, the only person talking about loving thy brother is the preacher,  
And it seems nobody's interested in learning, but the teacher,  
Segregation, demonstration, integration, determination, aggravation,
humiliation,  
Obligation to our nation.  
  
Ball of confusion,  
That's what the world is today, hey.  
  
The sale of pills is at an all time high,  
Young folks walk with their heads in the sky,  
The cities aflame in the summertime,  
And oh the beat goes on.  
  
Evolution, revolution, gun control, sound of soul-shooting rockets to the
moon,  
Kids growing up too soon,  
Politicians say, "More taxes will solve everything,"  
The band played on.  
  
So, round and around and around we go,  
Where the world's headed, nobody knows  
  
Oh, Great Googamooga,  
Can't you hear me talking to you,  
Just a ball of confusion,  
That's what the world is today, hey.  
  
Fear in the air, tension everywhere,  
Unemployment rising fast,  
The Beatles new record's a gas,  
And the only safe place to live,  
Is on an Indian reservation,  
The band played on.  
  
Eve of destruction, tax deduction,  
City inspectors, bill collectors, mod clothes in demand,  
Population out of hand, suicide, too many bills,  
Hippies moving to the hills,  
People all over the world are shouting, "End the war!",  
And the band played on.  
  
Great Googamooga,  
Can't you hear me talking to you,  
Just a Ball Of Confusion, -ac

Barbara  
Barbara  
Barbara, my love  
  
If Barbara were an angel  
I pray she'd watch over me  
If Barbara were a queen  
Her servant I would be  
  
If Barbara would be mine  
And wear my high school ring  
Then I'd climb the highest mountain  
Do just anything  
  
If Barbara were the winter chill  
I'd stand out in the cold  
If Barbara were a tree  
Her branches I would hold  
  
If Barbara would love me  
And say that she'd be mine  
I'd swim the deepest ocean  
Stop the hands of time  
  
Barbara please say  
(That you're the one in love with me)  
Don't let me lead  
(This life, this life of misery)  
Oh, oh, oh  
  
Let me kiss your tender lips  
And know your secret charms  
And let me know what real love is  
And hold you in my arms  
  
And if this love I pray for  
Should it all come true  
Then with all my heart, dear  
I'd love no one but you  
  
I'll hold you in my arms  
For now and ever more  
And we will walk together  
Through love's sacred door

Girl, as you walk by  
I breathe a sigh.  
And deep inside I knew it had to be.  
This little girl is mine.  
And for a little while I heard a strange rhapsody.  
Hm

Don't let go. (Don't let go)  
Don't let go. (Don't let go)  
Baby, don't let her go. (Don't let go)  
Please (Don't let go)  
  
You better come on and take my hand.  
'Cause I don't understand, this crazy feeling in my soul.  
But I know that I would rather die, then let this feeling go.  
  
Now girl can't you see (See)  
That this was meant to be. (Be)  
It's funny but it's true.  
I guess I was just born to love you. (Born to love you)  
  
Darling (Born to love you)  
Darling I (Born to love you)  
I was born (Born to love you)  
Born to love only you. (Born to love you)

Believe what I tell you, baby (Born to love you)  
I was born to love only you. (Born to love you)

Without your love I can never be myself  
Oh, when you gonna come home Cindy

Childhood part of my life, it wasn't very pretty.  
You see, I was born and raised in the slums of the city,  
It was a one room shack that slept ten other children besides me.  
We hardly had enough food or room to sleep.  
It was hard times,  
Needed something to ease my troubled mind.  
Listen! my father didn't know the meaning of work,  
He disrespected mama, and treated us like dirt.  
I left home, seekin' a job that I never did find,  
Depressed and downhearted I took to cloud nine,  
I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.  
Listen one more time I'm doin' fine, up here on cloud nine.  
Folks down there tell me,  
They say, "give yourself a chance son, don't let life pass you by".  
But the world of reality is a rat race where only the strongest survive,  
It's a dog eat dog world, and that ain't no lie.  
Listen! it ain't even safe no more to walk the streets at night,  
I'm doin' fine, on cloud nine.  
Let me tell you about cloud nine.  
  
Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be  
(cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,  
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free  
(cloud nine) and you're a million miles from reality.  
I wanna say I love the life I live,  
And I'm gonna live the life I love up here on cloud nine.  
I'm riding high  
On cloud nine, you're as free as a bird in flight  
(cloud nine) there's no diff'rence between day and night  
(cloud nine) it's a world of love and harmony  
(cloud nine) you're a million miles from reality.  
  
Cloud nine, you can be what you wanna be  
Cloud nine) you ain't got no responsibility,  
And ev'ry man, ev'ry man is free  
(cloud nine) and you're a million miles from reality.  
(cloud nine) (cloud nine) (cloud nine)

But pay no mind 'cause I love you much more my dear, huh

If you ever walk away in to his arms  
Which will surely break my heart in two

No, no, no, no (Don't let him, don't let him take your love from me)  
Oh, I couldn't stand it, baby  
  
If you leave me for him you would truly be unfair  
Now, just ask yourself, whenever you needed me, wasn't I always there  
Now, I'm begging you, baby, baby, down on my bended knees  
Baby, baby, baby, baby, baby, please stay here with me

I love you girl, with all my heart and soul  
I can't understand why you treat me cold  
Your every wish, girl, is my command  
And that's why I can't seem to understand why  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue  
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue  
  
One day you say you love me too  
The next day you tell me that we are through  
My love for you is just a game  
But each time we play, girl, my heart feels the pain  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Oh)  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (So blue)  
  
Woo girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Make me blue)  
Oh girl, oh girl, oh girl tell me why can't you be true (Can't be true)  
The way you treat me it just isn't fair  
You make it so plain you just don't care  
You have a ball around my time.  
Sleepless nights are getting me tired  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue  
I'm askin' you girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue (Baby)  
Girl, girl, girl why you want to make me blue

This little girl of mine  
I wanna say that she's so fine  
And each and every day  
I make sure she has her way  
Now we don't feel tied down  
Although our hearts are bound  
I don't have to chase her all over town  
My baby she's always around  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
The girl's alright with me  
You know the girl's alright  
  
Now she's so good to me  
I guess that's why I feel fancy free  
Just to see the glow in her eyes  
Makes me once again realize  
I love her with all of my heart  
And I know we'll never ever part  
I never heard about or caught her playin'  
I guess that's why you always hear me sayin'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
When I visit at her home  
Other fellas never, never ring her phone  
She let's them know just where they stand  
She tells them all that I'm her man  
And when we're out on a date  
All the fellas wait till I walk away  
They try to beat my time  
She tells them in a nice way she's mine, all mine  
  
[Chorus]

If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones  
  
We're all made  
With feet of clay and some dreams  
We're born alone  
And we die alone  
Why can't we live  
In between  
  
I don't care  
What goes on in your house  
When you close the door  
If you stop lookin' in my bedroom window  
I'll stop lookin' in yours  
  
My girl came home and she caught me with Alice  
And she threw me out the door  
Now, now now,  
But the real reason that she was so mad  
Is that she was with Alice before!  
Say what?  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
No don'tcha throw no stones  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don'tcha throw stones  
  
Sweet talkin'  
Bar hoppin'  
Pill poppin'  
Wife swappin'  
Swappin  
Swappin  
Sweet talkin'  
Bar hoppin'  
Pill poppin'  
Wife swappin'  
Swappin  
Swappin  
  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones  
If you're livin' in a glass house  
Don't throw no stones  

You better beware, my friends all told me.  
When they saw that I was falling for you. You better beware.  
Now, they told me that girl ain't gonna be true.  
  
She'll have you walking with your head in the air.  
Have you thinking that she really, really care.  
Then-a, then she'll let you down, she'll really let you down.  
  
She's a girl with no understanding.  
And when she's getting tired of you hanging around  
She'll let you drop and say... have a happy landing.  
  
Oh but I fell for you anyway.  
I didn't care what my friends have to say.  
'Cause I was so glad that I had found you.  
I build my whole world right around you.  
  
You had me hope on a lie for awhile. (?)  
Have me thinking you'd be mine for awhile.  
Then-a, then you let me down, you really let me down.  
  
'Cause you're a girl with no understanding.

Staying away for a long, long time.  
You won't call it a lost of loving.  
Now ya coming back to the scene of your crime.  
  
Gonna keep you in suspense for awhile, yeah.  
Keep you hanging on a fence for awhile.

I ain't gonna have no understanding.  
And when I get tired of you hanging around  
I'll let you drop and say... girl, you've had your happy landing.

Hey Jude, don't make it bad  
Take a sad song and make it better  
Remember to let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
Hey Jude, don't be afraid  
You were made to go out and get her  
The minute you let her under your skin  
Then you begin to make it better  
  
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain  
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders  
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool  
By making his world a little colder  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah  
  
Hey Jude, don't let me down  
You have found her, now go and get her  
Remember to let her into your heart  
Then you can start to make it better  
  
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin  
You're waiting for someone to perform with  
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude, you'll do  
The movement you need is on your shoulder  
Nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah nah yeah  
  
Hey Jude, don't make it bad  
Take a sad song and make it better  
Remember to let her under your skin  
Then you'll begin to make it

You know, every house has a door and every room has a floor.  
Every fence has a gate and every beast has a mate.  
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.  
I ain't got nothing.  
  
Every stove has a fire and every car has a tire.  
Every fish has a bowl and every shoe has a sole.  
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.  
I ain't got nothing.  
  
Now I don't care about politics and things across the sea.  
All I want all I want to do is love  
And have somebody love me. I need I need somebody.  
  
Every lion has a den and every little pig has its pen.  
Every road has a way and (they tell me) every dog has its day.  
Everybody, everybody's got something but me.  
I ain't got nothing I ain't got nothing. Oh no.  
(repeat to fade)

Now, if a rock, should separate us.  
I'm gonna think of a way I can move that rock.  
(Move the rock, move the rock)  
  
And if a clock, should keep me waiting.  
I'm gonna think of a way I can speed the clock.  
(Speed the clock, speed the clock)  
  
And if a wall is between us.  
I'm gonna think of a way I can climb that wall.  
  
I tried to think of something I wouldn't do.  
Baby, to get a little closer to you.  
You know what?  
I couldn't think of a thing at all.  
I couldn't think of a thing at all.  
  
Now, if an opinion should become between us.  
I'm gonna think of a way we can reach an agreement.  
(An agreement, an agreement)  
  
And if a brick floor, should be between us.  
I'm gonna think of a way I can dig through the ceiling.  
(Through the ceiling, through the ceiling)  
  
If there's a ball of fire between us.  
I'm gonna think of a way to get through that ball.  
  
I tried to think of something I wouldn't do.  
Baby, to get a little closer to you.  
You know what?  
I couldn't think of a thing at all.  
Baby, I couldn't think of a thing at all.  
Hmmm  
  
Yeah, yeah.  
  
Now if a million miles, should separate us.  
I'm gonna think of a way I can cross those miles.  
(Cross the miles, cross the miles)  
  
And if my actions, begin to bore ya.  
I'm gonna think of a way I can change my style.  
(Change my style, change my style)  
  
And if there's burning hall between us.  
I'm gonna think of a way to get down that hall.  
  
I tried to think of something I wouldn't do.  
Hey, to get a little closer to you.  
You know what?  
I couldn't think of a thing at all.  
Believe me. (I couldn't think of a thing at all)  
Hear what I say. (I couldn't think of a thing at all)  
Believe when I tell ya. (I couldn't think of a thing at all)  
I tried and I tried. (I couldn't think of a thing at all)

You ask if I remembered, when we first met.  
Girl, tell me how could I ever forget  
  
There, you were standing there.  
Aw, with ruby lips and the golden hair.  
Your beauty seem to hypnotize me.  
I had that feeling I was no longer free.  
  
But when I ask you for a dance. (For a dance)  
You wouldn't even give me a chance. (Me a chance)  
And it hurt me through and through.  
That was the first time I got over you.  
  
You had my heart dingling,  
Like a puppet on a string.  
To you I meant nothing, darling.  
But to me it meant everything.  
Girl, you know since then through the years. (Through the years)  
I've shed so many tears. (So many tears)  
And all because of you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to.  
  
I don't know why I still love you.  
'Cause you don't even want me around.  
Year after year it's the same o' thing.  
You build me up, to let me down.  
  
So go on and hurt me. (Hurt me)  
Aw, like you did.  
This time it'll be different.  
Mmm, my tears you'll see no more.  
'Cause I've cried so through the years. (Through the years)  
Until I run out of tears. (Run out of tears)  
And all because of you, I couldn't cry if I wanted to.  
  
I'll never shed another tear.  
I couldn't cry no more, darling.  
Seems as though the pain  
Have gone the tears from my eyes.  
Never cry, never.  
Never no more.  
I'll never shed another tear.

I bet you're wonderin' how I knew  
'Bout your plans to make me blue  
With some other guy you knew before  
Between the two of us guys  
You know I loved you more  
It took me by surprise I must say  
When I found out yesterday  
Don't you know that I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh I heard it through the grapevine  
Oh I'm just about to lose my mind  
  
Honey, honey yeah.  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine baby  
  
I know a man ain't supposed to cry  
But these tears I can't hold inside  
Losin' you would end my life you see  
'Cause you mean that much to me  
You could have told me yourself  
That you loved some one else  
Instead I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine  
Oh, I heard it through the grapevine  
And I'm just about to lose my mind  
  
Honey, honey yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine, baby  
  
People say believe half of what you see  
Son and none of what you hear  
But I can't help but be confused  
If it's true please tell me dear  
Do you plan to let me go  
For the other guy you loved before?  
  
Don't you know I heard it through the grapevine  
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine  
I'm just about to love my mind  
Honey, honey, yeah  
I heard it through the grapevine,  
Not much longer would you be mine, baby yeah

Da da da da da da ho  
Da da da da da da da ho ho  
  
You say you gonna leave me, for the arms of another.  
You say my love for you is no good and we can't go any further.  
But have pity on me.  
I was blind but know I see.  
Stay with me and never walk out of my life.  
  
Because,  
Oh, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')  
Oh, oh, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)  
  
in spite of all the wrong I've done, I'll make it up to ya.  
Even if it takes all my life, I'll prove my love to ya.  
So please don't go away.  
With me always stay, 'cause I love you.  
And I couldn't stand it being away, girl.  
  
Oh, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')  
Oh, oh, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)  
  
Girl, restore the faith you had in me.  
I'm beggin' you down on my knees.  
Please don't take your love from me.  
Don't leave me, don't leave.  
  
Forgive this fool, for causing your heart to suffer.  
Remember two wrongs don't make a right, it'll only make things tougher.  
So have little sympathy, on a poor fool like me.  
And stay with me, please don't walk out of my life.  
  
Because  
Oh, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')  
Oh, oh, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)  
  
Oh baby, baby, baby. (I need your lovin')  
Oh, woo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin', baby)  
Oh oh oh (I need your lovin')  
I need your lovin' baby, baby, baby. (I need your lovin', baby)  
Oh, woo, I need your lovin'. (I need your lovin')  
I need it, I need it.

Goodbye, no use leading with our chins  
This is where our story ends  
Never lovers, ever friends  
Goodbye, let our hearts call it a day  
But before you walk away  
I sincerely want to say  
I wish you bluebirds in the spring  
To give your heart a song to sing  
And then a kiss, but more than this  
I wish you love  
And in July a lemonade  
To cool you in some leafy glade  
I wish you health  
But more than wealth  
I wish you love  
My breaking heart and I agree  
That you and I could never be  
So with my best  
My very best  
I set you free  
I wish you shelter from the storm  
A cozy fire to keep you warm  
But most of all when snowflakes fall  
I wish you love  
But most of all when snowflakes fall  
I wish you love  
I wish you love  
I wish you love, love, love, love, love  
I wish you love

If you decide to make me blue, I'll be in trouble.

I will build you a castle with a tower so high  
Till it reaches the moon  
I'll gather melodies from birdies that fly  
And compose you a tune  
Give you lovin' as warm as Mama's oven  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
I'll try something new  
  
I will take you away with me as far as I can  
To Venus or Mars  
There we will love with your hand in my hand  
You'll be king of the stars  
Every day we can play on the Milky Way  
And if that don't do  
I'll have to try something new  
I'll try something new  
  
I will bring you a flower from the floor of the sea  
To wear in your hair  
(Thank you)  
I'll do anything and every little thing to make you happy, boy  
To show you that I care  
I'll pretend I'm jealous of all the fellas  
And if that don't do  
Then I'll try something new  
I'll try something new

Like a snowball rolling down the side of a snow covered hill, it's growing.  
Like the size of a fish that the man claims broke his reel, it's growing.  
Like a rosebud blooming in the warm of the summer sun, it's growing.  
Like the tale by the time it's been told by more than one, woo, it's growing.  
  
Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before.

When he knows that she's gone to stay, woo, it growing.  
  
Everyday it grows a little more than it was the day before.  
My love for you just grows and grows.  
Oh, how it grows and it grows.

(Hey, hey, hey, nobody knows) It gets a little wider.  
(Nobody knows) Oh, it gets a little stronger.  
(Hey, hey, hey) The feeling for each kiss, baby.  
(Hey, hey, hey) Oh, it lasts a little longer, yeah.

You made a fool out of someone. (Out of someone)  
You thought love was true  
And found out that you were just having fun. (Just having fun)  
  
And oh, why do you want to make me blue?  
After all, I've been good to you. (I've been good to you)  
Oh, yes I have.

Life lands a freshing blow.  
And once again our heart is broken.  
And as history repeats itself.  
These few words are sadly spoken.  
  
I've passed this way before.  
I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.  
  
As I watch love walking away.  
It brings back old memories.  
But a familiar pain still feels the same.  
Once again, heartache has found me.  
  
A dark cloud covered my heart.  
Oh, when she told me goodbye.  
Now there's nothing left but emptiness.  
And the tears that filled my crying eyes.  
  
I've passed this way before.  
I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.  
  
No matter how strong a man is.  
Without a love he walks in the dark, baby.  
If love deserts him it would surely hurt him.  
'Cause his weakness is his heart.  
  
A lonely journey now stands before me.  
The endless pain has started.  
But this time I know the way.  
Walking alone and broken hearted.  
  
Because I've passed this way before.  
And I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.  
  
I've passed this way before.  
I've felt this pain before.  
A hurt that took so long to end.  
Has found my poor heart again.

Oh the weather outside is frightful  
But the fire is so delightful  
And since we've no place to go  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
And it doesn't show signs of stopping  
And I've brought some corn for popping  
The lights are turned way down low  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
When we finally kiss goodnight  
How I'll hate going out in the storm  
But if you really hold me tight  
All the way home I'll be warm  
  
And the fire is slowly dying  
And my dear is still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
  
And the fire is slowly dying  
And my dear is still goodbyeing  
But as long as you love me so  
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow  
Let it snow

Now, I'm a guy who's fond of sweet things  
Sweet things I adore  
In coffee most take one or two lumps, but I use three or four  
But since I kissed your sweet, sweet lips  
Sugar ain't sweet no more  
Your kiss was sweeter than any cup of coffee I ever made before!  
  
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
If ever a man had a sweet tooth, I have one indeed!  
I order cookies and cakes, malts and shakes from the menus that I read!  
  
But all the cakes, and shakes, and malts I've bought put together  
Don't exceed the sweetness in just one of your kisses  
Baby, you're the one I need!  
  
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
  
Now listen to me, you sweet thing  
Hear what I have to say  
If ever you need somebody, send for me without delay!  
  
But do one thing for me: Don't go out on a rainy day  
'Cause if it's true that rain melts sugar, you will surely melt away!  
  
You know you're Little Miss Sweetness  
Ah, you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
Trying to tell you you're Little Miss Sweetness  
The sweetest girl in the world  
The sweetest girl in the world

To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
To run where the brave dare not go  
  
To right the unrightable wrong  
To love pure and chaste from afar  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
  
This is my quest to follow that star  
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far  
To fight for the right  
Without question or pause  
To be willing to march  
Into hell for a heavenly cause  
  
And I know if I'll only be true  
To this glorious quest  
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm  
When I'm laid to my rest  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man, scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable star  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To dream the impossible dream  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man, scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable star  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To dream the impossible dream

May I have this dance  
I've been waitin' for this chance  
All night long (all night long)  
And this night I'll always treasure  
If I could have the pleasure  
To escort you  
  
Don't you know I've bit my nails in to  
Wantin' to dance with you  
But I was much too shy  
I never had the nerve  
Before you'd dance across the floor with another guy  
The way he held you in his arms  
With his many charms  
I knew my chances were slim  
In order to get to you  
There's only one thing to do  
So I got rid of him  
  
Hey  
Ooh hoo I told him that a girl  
By the name of pearl  
Was looking for him  
And when I turned around  
He was nowhere to be found  
  
So here I am  
Oh I gotta have this dance (gotta have this dance with you)  
Honey I (gotta have this dance with you)  
Honey I, honey I, honey I, have this dance  
Honey I (gotta have this dance with you)  
Gotta have this dance  
Oh

Wish that I could wind  
Like a spiral stair through time  
To your body next to mine  
Warm and satisfied  
Wish that I could catch  
A night train to the past  
Climb aboard and hear you ask  
Darling come inside  
  
Memories, memories  
Sweet, sweet memories  
Of days gone by  
That make me cry  
Memories, memories, memories  
Sweet memories  
That make me sad  
They take me back  
To you  
(memories, memories  
ah ah ah ah ah ah ah  
ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba)  
  
Watching falling stars  
On the grass by my own car  
Making love there in the dark  
Thinking we're alone  
Old man shined his light  
Trying not to act surprised  
He left hard and all uptight  
Told us to get on home  
  
Memories, memories  
Sweet sweet memories  
Of love we shared  
Of love we shared  
Memories memories  
Sweet memories  
Of love we shared  
We will never  
Share them again

[Melvin]  
Yes, my skin is black,  
But that's no reason to hold me back.  
  
[Eddie]  
Why don't you think about it?  
Think about it, think about it, think about it,  
Think about it...  
I have wants and desires,  
Just like you.  
So move on the side,  
'Cause I'm comin' through, oh!  
  
[Temptations]  
No matter how hard you try,  
You can't stop me now.  
  
[Eddie and Temptations]  
No matter how hard you try,  
You can't stop me now, oooh...  
  
[Melvin]  
Yes, your skin is white...  
Does that make you right?  
  
[Eddie]  
Why don't you think about it?  
Think about it, think about it, think about it,  
Think about it...  
This is a message,  
A message to y'all:  
Together we stand,  
Divided we fall, oh!  
  
[Dennis]  
Black is a color,  
Just like white.  
Tell me: how can a color determine whether  
You're wrong or right?  
We all have our faults...  
Yes we do.  
  
[Eddie]  
So look in your mirror.  
  
[Temptations]  
Look in the mirror.  
  
[Eddie]  
What do you see?  
  
[Temptations]  
What do you see?  
  
[Eddie]  
Two eyes.  
  
[Temptations]  
Two eyes.  
  
[Eddie]  
A nose, and a mouth, just like me, oh!  
  
[Eddie]  
Your eyes are open,  
But you refuse to see,  
The laws of society  
Were made for both you, and me.  
Because of my color,  
I struggle to be free.  
Sticks and stones,  
May break my bones,  
But in the end,  
You're gonna' see my friend, oh!  
  
[Temptations]  
No matter how hard you try,  
You can't stop me now.  
  
[Temptations]  
Say it loud!  
No matter how hard you try,  
You can't stop me now.

It was the third of September  
That day I'll always remember, yes I will  
'Cause that was the day, that my daddy died  
I never got a chance to see him  
Never heard nothin' but bad things about him  
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth  
Momma just hung her head and said, son  
  
[Chorus]  
Papa was a rolling stone,  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died, all he left us was alone  
Papa was a rolling stone, (my son, yeah)  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died, all he left us was alone  
  
Hey Momma!  
Is it true what they say that Papa never worked a day, in his life  
And Momma, some bad talk goin' round town sayin' that  
Papa had three outside children  
And another wife, and that ain't right  
Heard some talk Papa doing some store front preachin'  
Talking about saving souls and all the time leechin'  
Dealing in dirt, and stealing in the name of the Lord  
Momma just hung her head and said  
  
Papa was a rolling stone, (my son)  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died, all he left us was alone  
Hey Papa was a rolling stone, (dad gumma it)  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died, all he left us was alone  
  
Hey Momma,  
I heard Papa called himself a jack of all trades  
Tell me is that what sent Papa to an early grave  
Folks say Papa would beg, borrow, steal  
To pay his bills  
Hey Momma,  
Folks say Papa never was much on thinking  
Spent most of his time chasing women and drinking  
Momma I'm depending on you, to tell me the truth  
Momma looked up with a tear in her eye and said, son  
  
Papa was a rolling stone, (well, well, well, well)  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died, all he left us was alone (lone, lone, lone, alone)  
Papa was a rolling stone,  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died, all he left us was alone  
  
(I said) Papa was a rolling stone, (yes he was my son)  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home  
And when he died, all he left us was alone  
(My daddy was, yes he was, yeah he was)  
(Papa was a rolling stone,  
Where ever he laid his hat was his home)

Lady luck and the four leaf clover  
Won't be as hurt as I feel all over  
My life for one special occasion  
'Til you leave in depth the situation  
  
Well well well standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
My car got repossessed this morning  
Harder times I haven't seen in years  
Able to throw me a life preserver  
'cause I'm about to drown in my own tears  
  
Well well well standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
Standing on shakey ground  
Ever since you put me down  
  
Well well well standing on shakey ground

Some enchanted evening  
You may see a stranger,  
You may see a stranger  
Across a crowded room  
And somehow you know,  
You know even then  
That somewhere you'll see her  
Again and again.  
  
Some enchanted evening  
Someone may be laughin',  
You may hear her laughin'  
Across a crowded room  
And night after night,  
As strange as it seems  
The sound of her laughter  
Will sing in your dreams.  
  
Who can explain it?  
Who can tell you why?  
Fools give you reasons,  
Wise men never try.  
  
Some enchanted evening  
When you find your true love,  
When you feel her call you  
Across a crowded room,  
Then fly to her side,  
And make her your own  
For all through your life you  
May dream all alone.  
  
Once you have found her,  
Never let her go.  
Once you have found her,  
Never let her go!

Remember me the one who heard your cries  
And reached out and dried your eyes  
  
Remember me the one who found you and wrapped all my love around you  
When you were all alone and all your dreams were gone  
When you were nothing but a tear stained face I took you in  
Know your broken wing has mended and your need for me has ended  
Know you say you must be free  
You wanna fly away from me  
You were lost in yesterday I gave you my tomorrow  
Know your leaving me in sorrow and you telling me: "im sorry" but baby  
  
Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you  
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true  
  
Out of sympathy and all you feel for me  
After all the sweet love I've given you (given you baby)  
Girl you walk away with the best of me  
The love I gave to you, you given to someone new  
And sorry won't ease this misery  
  
Remember me who took the hand, held it up to make a stand  
Remember me the one who's love has shared, with one who really cares  
  
Now you've turned away from me and say that you sorry  
That it had to be baby sorry it had to be that way  
  
Sorry is a sorry word after all I've done for you  
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true  
Sorry is a sorry word when I need a love that's true

Ooh:ooh:mmm:mmm:yeah:hey:

I'll save you from the highest mountain (The highest mountain)  
Paint the words acro

I need your sweet, sweet inspiration  
I need you here on my mind every hour of the day  
Without your sweet, sweet inspiration  
The lonely hours of the day just don't go my way.  
A woman in love needs sweet inspiration  
And honey that's all I ask  
You know that's all I ask from you  
I gotta have your sweet inspiration, yeah  
You know there just ain't no telling  
What a satisfied woman might do.  
When you call "Baby", baby  
Is such a sweet inspiration  
And when you call me "Darling", darling  
Sets my heart a-skating  
And if I'm out in the rain, baby  
And in a bad situation  
You know I just reach back in my mind  
And there I find your sweet, sweet inspiration.  
Inspiration, yeah, oh, what a power  
And I got the power every hour of the day  
I need your sweet, sweet, sweet, sweet inspiration, yeah  
To go on living, to keep on giving this way.  
I need your sweet, sweet inspiration  
And I got the power every hour of the day  
I need your sweet, sweet inspiration  
To go on living, to keep on giving this way.

Feather in your cap if you catch a robber,  
Dirt in your face if your scheme falls through  
Pay close attention to my story  
You'll find every word is true.  
Junk man standing on the corner  
Selling death, no conscience has he.  
  
In the name of God, won't somebody stop him  
Stop him, think about the children  
Its a matter of life and death, you see.  
Ain't no time to stand back and point your finger,  
We've got to face reality.  
No, no, no, no, no  
  
Don't turn your back on this problem, people,  
Too much depends on you and me.  
Desperate with no sense of value,  
Just an evil mind lurking through the night.  
  
Because of you, the streets ain't safe no more for walking,  
Cause you're feeling so up-tight.  
Take a look around

Chestnuts roasting on an open fire,  
Jack Frost nipping at your nose,  
Yuletide songs being sung by a choir,  
And folks dressed up like Eskimos.  
  
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe  
Help to make the season bright.  
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow  
Will find it hard to sleep tonight.  
They know that Santa's on his way,  
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh.  
And every mother's child will want to spy  
To see if reindeer really know how to fly.  
  
And so I'm offering this simple phrase  
For kids from one to ninety-two,  
Although it's been said many times, many ways,  
Merry Christmas to you.  
They know that Santa's on his way

The first time ever I saw your face  
I thought the sun rose in your eyes  
And the moon and the stars were the gifts you gave  
To the dark and the endless skies, my love  
To the dark and the endless skies  
  
And the first time ever I kissed your mouth  
I felt the earth move in my hands  
Like the trembling heart of a captive bird  
That was there at my command, my love  
That was there at my command, my love  
  
And the first time ever I lay with you  
I felt your heart so close to mine  
And I knew our joy would fill the earth  
And last till the end of time, my love  
And it will last till the end of time, my love  
  
The first time ever I saw your face, your face  
Your face, your face

Many a man has gone away  
Many a man has gone astray  
Searching for the treasures of a love that's true  
I'm hoping that my treasure can be you  
Cause I believe, I believe  
  
The further you look  
Show love now  
The less you see  
I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me  
  
I've seen men carry their hopes from town to town  
Trying to track lost treasures down  
Some find true love before their hopes are gone  
Others lose hope and they have to --yes, now -- move on  
And I can hear them say as they go down  
  
The further you look,  
You better know that  
The less you see  
So I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me  
  
Oh oh oh oh  
Travel, traveling on  
Wondering if they've done something wrong  
Moving on becoming a rover  
But if you'll be mine, my searching is all over because now  
  
The further you look,  
Show love now  
The less you see  
I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me  
  
And I know, I know, I know  
The further you look,  
the less you're gonna see  
so I'm hoping you'd be the treasure meant for me  
  
And I believe, I believe right now  
The further you look,  
the less you're gonna see  
so I'm hoping you'll be the treasure meant for me

To dream the impossible dream  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To bear with unbearable sorrow  
To run where the brave dare not go  
  
To right the unrightable wrong  
To love pure and chaste from afar  
To try when your arms are too weary  
To reach the unreachable star  
  
This is my quest to follow that star  
No matter how hopeless, no matter how far  
To fight for the right  
Without question or pause  
To be willing to march  
Into hell for a heavenly cause  
  
And I know if I'll only be true  
To this glorious quest  
That my heart will lie peaceful and calm  
When I'm laid to my rest  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man, scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable star  
The fight the unbeatable foe  
To dream the impossible dream  
  
And the world will be better for this  
That one man, scorned and covered with scars  
Still strove with his last ounce of courage  
To reach the unreachable star  
To fight the unbeatable foe  
To dream the impossible dream

What good are words I say to you?  
They can't convey to you what's in my heart  
If you could hear instead  
The things I've left unsaid  
  
Time after time  
I tell myself that I'm  
So lucky to be loving you  
  
So lucky to be  
The one you run to see  
In the evening, when the day is through  
  
I only know what I know  
The passing years will show  
You've kept my love so young, so new  
  
And time after time  
You'll hear me say that I'm  
So lucky to be loving you  
  
I only know what I know

You've kept my love so young, so new  
  
And time after time

In store for me (ah ah ah ah)

That chivalry is dead, no  
'Cause I believe a woman should be treated  
With the utmost respect, mmm-hmm-  
  
Don't be afraid, don't turn and walk away  
I want to get to know ya, well  
Don't be ashamed, don't say that love's to blame  
Just come and look me over  
  
You'll find a heart  
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for  
How could anybody ask for much more, woo-hoo-  
  
Now I like openin' doors  
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor  
Treat her like a lady  
(Treat her like lady])  
Light her cigarette if she smokes  
Even (Help her with her coat), well  
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)  
  
In this world of liberation  
It's so easy to forget, mmm-  
That it's so nice to have a man around  
To lend a helping hand, you can bet, bet you can, baby  
  
When I was young, my mama used to say, Boy  
A woman's like a flower, with love on her you shower  
Ever since that day, her words never went away  
I always will remember to treat my baby tender  
  
You'll find a heart  
You'll find a heart that you've always been lookin' for  
How could anybody ask for much more, whoa-ooh-ooh-  
  
Now I like openin' doors  
Pickin' up (Yeah) her hanky (Yeah) off the floor  
Treat her like a lady (Treat her like lady)  
Light her cigarette if she smokes  
Even (Help her with her coat), oh, whoa  
Treat her like a lady  
(Treat her like lady)  
  
Compliment her in her hair  
Even help her with her chair  
Treat her like a lady  
(Treat her like lady)  
She's a bad son-

Now you're moving on up, pretty baby  
You're leaving me behind  
Everybody seems to love you  
Ooh, you're doing just fine, fine, fine  
  
Take away your good looks  
And all your fancy clothes  
I bet you want to try it baby  
And you'll see  
That nobody loves you but me  
Now what do you think about that?  
  
Hey, Melvin  
Now you tell me that you so busy  
Ooh, baby you ain't got much time  
Oh, how will I remember, babe  
When all your time was mine, mine, mine  
  
Well move on back cross the track  
Yeah, where you came from  
Yeah, why don't you just try it baby  
And you'll see  
Nobody loves you but me  
Yeah, nobody but me  
Try it  
  
If you think I'm lying  
Try it  
Try it baby  
  
Oh, well move on back cross the track, baby  
Yeah, where you came from  
Come on and try, try it honey, try it baby, try it sweet  
And you'll see  
Nobody loves you but me  
Nobody loves you but me  
  
Listen, I really want to hold you, pretty baby  
In my arms again  
But I can't get close to you  
For all your love afraid  
But take your name from the bad list  
And tear me your arms through  
Come on and try it baby  
I'm gonna try it sweetheart  
Try it honey  
You'll see, nobody loves you but me  
Nobody but me

I've got a lover way over there on the mountain side  
And I know that's where I should be  
Don't you know  
I've got a lover way over there across the river wide  
I can hear her calling to me  
Oh, she's calling my name  
So sweet so plain I can hear her saying  
(Come to me, baby)  
I'm on my way  
(Come to me baby)  
I'm gonna stay  
(Come to me baby)  
  
They tell me that the river's too deep  
And it's much too wide  
Boy, you can't get over to the other side  
But they don't know I got to get there  
And hold her in my arms just one more time  
Like I did before when she was mine, all mine  
'Cause I hear her saying,  
(Come to me baby)  
I'm on my way  
(Come to me baby)  
I'm gonna stay  
I'm gonna get to you  
No matter what I have to do  

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
  
Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
Oh, white Christmas  
Sleigh bells in the snow  
  
Oh, I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white

Who can I turn to  
When nobody needs me  
My heart wants to know  
So I must go  
Where destiny leads me  
With no star to guide me  
And no one beside me  
  
I'll go on my way  
And after the day  
The darkness will hide me  
But maybe tomorrow  
I'll find what I'm after  
I'll throw off my sorrow  
Beg, steal or borrow  
My share of laughter  
'Cause with you I could learn to  
With you on a new day  
  
But who can I turn to  
If you turn away  
With you I could learn to  
With you on a new day  
But who can I turn to  
If you turn away

One day, you will be cared to realize  
By the look that's in my eyes  
  
[Chorus]  
How much I love you  
(Love you)  
And if you leave you'll lose a precious love  
(You'll lose a precious love)  
  
Somehow,these arms of mine cant let you go  
The touch of my hand baby should let you know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We go together like hand and glove  
Don't destroy our precious love,  
Somehow these arms of mine cant let you go  
The touch of my hand should let you know

Just for your  
Wonderful love  
Wonderful love  
I'd give anything  
In this whole wide world  
Just believe in me  
Please have a little faith in me  
Darling I'll never  
I'll never let you down  
Now that I have  
  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
  
Darling darling darling darling  
Im so happy  
But I cant tell my friends that  
You're my girl  
Im so proud  
Yes so proud  
I just wanna fall on my knees and cry  
Cry out loud  
That I have  
  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
Your wonderful love  
  
(I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad, I'm so glad)

You surely must know magic, girl, 'cause you changed my life.  
It was dull and ordinary  
But you made it sunny and bright.  
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you,  
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me.  
  
When my way was dark and troubles were near,  
Your love provided the light so I couldn't see, girl  
Just knowing your love was near when times were bad  
Kept the world from closing in on me, girl.  
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you,  
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me.  
  
You're part of ev'ry thought I think each day,  
Your name is in ev'ry phrase my lips say,  
Ev'ry dream I dream is about you.  
Honey I couldn't live without you,  
Baby! baby! baby, you're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
Yes, you are, you're my ev'rything,  
Girl, you're the girl I sing about in ev'ry love song I sing.  
You're my winter, baby, my summer, my fall, my spring.  
I was blessed the day I found you, gonna build my whole world around you,  
You're ev'rything good, girl and you're all that matters to me.  
  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything.  
  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything,  
You're my ev'rything.
