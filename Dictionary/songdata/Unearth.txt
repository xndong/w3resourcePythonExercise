This marks the end of innocence  
Collapse now the common ground  
Beneath it all are fears of destiny  
As the bastard man cometh  
  
Concealed the omens howl  
Blinded the second sight  
Smothered, smothered  
To mask the coming of the dark  
  
And as I cling to this world  
I know there is cold blood running  
Alive, yet live to curse the days  
I know there is cold blood running  
  
Confess all arrogance  
Confide in circling wolves  
Ferocious blades bleeding the lifeblood  
As the bastard man forges on  
  
Capsized in periled plight  
Is this the only road?  
Alone, alone  
Will darkness lead to light?  
  
And as I cling to this world  
I know there is cold blood running  
Alive, yet live to curse the days  
I know there is cold blood running  
  
And as I cling to this world  
I know there is cold blood running  
Alive, yet live to curse the days  
This blood is running strong  
  
I was bound by the hands of false destiny  
No longer will I follow  
No longer will I follow hands of false destiny

Fall into line upon creation  
There is hell to pay  
Fall into line, life of the mundane  
There is hell to pay  
  
Time, our vengeful warden  
Existence brings forth pain and loss  
Make head of all the costs  
For your end is drawing near  
  
Your end is drawing near  
  
Through all I've seen  
These eyes have turned to black  
Stonewalled as my credence falls  
These eyes have turned to black  
  
Fall into line, death and disease  
There is hell to pay  
Shatter this life, all consuming  
There is hell to pay  
  
Through all I've seen  
These eyes have turned to black  
Stonewalled as my credence falls  
These eyes have turned to black  
  
The end is drawing near  
Forever black  
Your end is near  
  
Through all I've seen  
These eyes have turned to black  
Stonewalled as my credence falls  
These eyes have turned to black  
  
Forever black

I never cared to know your name  
Roll out the red it's all the same  
False idols scream for our love  
Compete for stage devote for name  
It's all pathetically the same  
Convinced of starlight beauty  
A must watch all tune in  
A celebration heartache  
Hail false heroes  
  
Surrender to our envy  
No boundaries left untouched  
No passion left for memories  
No passion for real memories  
  
Here we stand  
Lessened are the far and few who sustain,  
Protect and nurture  
  
Who stands before us  
We lay our lives down for the star  
Who stands before us  
  
We speak  
We lay our lives down for the star  
It's all pathetically the same

Lies.  
Under the eyes of suspicion.  
A time and place to cause destruction.  
Losing respect from the nations.  
  
Our own allies disapproval.  
Fuel the fire.  
Our own fathers shelter lies.  
Fuel the fire.  
  
Abusive power crushing lives.  
Fuel the fire.  
Our innocence betrayed.  
Bow to the presses of ability.  
  
Led times of anger to the grave.  
Show times of prosper.  
But who is saved?  
Under the hand of damnation.  
  
Many have lost faith.  
Lost all respect from the nations.  
Our own allies disapproval.  
Fire has gone on too long.  
  
Shadows are cast from our rule.  
Fire has gone on too long.  
Shadows are cast  
Now end the lies.  
Forced on me the casualties.  
  
Never will I believe.  
Kneel along the protective wrong.  
Never will I believe.  
Never will I believe in your destructive wrong.  
  
These eyes have wandered on.  
From the disgusting harm that cause so many to bleed  
And leave us with questioning ears.  
False informing our belief is serer.  
  
I'll always walk on.

Smother his life, the words cut right to the heart  
Disease and threaten my family name  
An epic stand is made, condemned  
I will not plead, I will not plead  
  
Damned to the beast of torment  
Damned by the beast within us all  
  
Crushed by the fear  
More stone, more stone  
More weight for Corey  
  
Not one step forth could capture a mission of guilt  
By law, avoids death on gallows hill  
Through time, his fight will martyr my name  
My soul free of a heretic  
  
Crushed by the fear  
More stone, more stone  
More weight for Corey  
  
Court of ayer and terminer  
Leave me my rightful land  
Court of ayer and terminer  
Leave me my rightful land  
To stow in my heart, leave to my sons  
  
Peine forte et dure is called  
An effort to collapse belief has failed  
And surely will die with me  
An epic stand is made, condemned  
I will not plead, I will not plead  
  
Damned to the beast of torment  
Damned by the beast within us all  
  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name  
Rectify my name

Time's venom boils  
Every breath ticking towards torment  
This carrier exposes our instability  
I will battle on  
I must choose a throne to succeed  
This domain in which I leave  
I'll battle on to carryout. 'til the cycle end its game  
I see the blood spilling out from the core  
Did my grave of opportunity  
Time stalks us all  
A scar filled test of who we are  
Dig my grave of opportunity  
Downward I have gone  
Still I bleed I won't die off  
Downward I have gone  
The end is yet to come  
I will battle on  
Time's venom boils  
Every breath ticking towards torment  
This carrier exposes our instability  
I see the blood spilling out from the core  
Did my grave of opportunity  
Time stalks us all  
A scar filled test of who we are  
Dig my grave of opportunity  
The end is yet to come  
  

Internal War  
Killing our own  
Burn the ones that have sinned against  
Claim their lives in your death romance  
Arm the young with your hunting toys  
By your own actions you are all to blame  
Power in the wrong hands our scaffold is destroyed  
Children killing children because our government has ignored  
I sling my arrows to shatter your walls  
No more creating victims from ignorance  
Left to second both sides  
Each one cries and lies  
No More War  
You've killed again  
My life for what  
Bound hands  
Yes you've all killed again  
Stand by as dying children wait for life  
The line has been crossed again  
How long will it take  
The line has been crossed again  
How long will it take to protect life

This life will soon come to an end  
I'll leave my convictions  
  
Day by day  
I feel this life slipping away  
Much further away  
I know I've lost it all  
  
Hold out your hands  
And take me from my misery  
There's no coming back from this  
I'll never wake  
  
I'll never wake, I never  
  
I never wanted to leave you all  
I never wanted to leave this life  
Nothing can save my now  
No one can save me  
  
I was left with no choice  
  
Freedom, my last wish to be  
Held on all I could  
Free me from this misery  
You know I'll never wake

Consumed by self loving pain, self loathing bliss  
It ears away, burns you like a cancer  
The feeling's inside, mask your size with your will  
Now you fall from heart and soul  
Break, years of frustration  
All too plain to see  
  
Ease into war  
Invade with foul fingers  
Lie to purify  
Crushing what's not you  
  
They say some are born with a blackened heart  
Fell to the curse of a bastard life  
Cursed with a bastard life  
Your lust to celebrate your name  
Will cause your fall  
Can't change, years of frustration  
All have yearned to see  
  
The pedestal crumble  
Ignored actor of aggression  
Falsify to slave  
Avoiding all that's true  
  
You stand up, then you fall heartless, soulless appetite  
You're crossing almost every line  
Now it's time to wash away  
You lost your way  
You crossed the line  
You crossed the line

Shut out and burned by your lies.  
Now it is time to make you learn.  
You'll learn.  
My heart bleeds no longer for your pathetic views.  
  
My heart beats on stronger with my own resolution.  
Bound down for so goddamn long.  
I have seen so many follow you.  
I fell victim to your clouded ways.  
  
It is my intention to end your reign.  
I know so many who would want to see your Burn.  
I aim war at you.  
I did not give into your hold.  
  
I live again alone.  
Pass through the sea of ashes kept.  
My heart bleeds no longer for your love.

Now, are you afraid or is the heart set on its time?  
Cold, the silence reigns do we close our blackened eyes?  
I'm calling on our testament to overcome  
I'm calling on  
It's now or never  
  
Overcome  
I'm calling on my testament to overcome  
I'm calling on  
To overcome  
  
We stand strong  
We won't break  
Side by side we overcome  
  
Now deliver us from all the hell I've seen  
Now deliver us for there's fire in these veins  
We're calling on the strengths that I've come to know  
I'm calling on  
It's now or never  
  
Overcome  
I'm calling on the strengths that I've come to know  
I'm calling on  
To overcome  
  
We stand strong  
We won't break  
Side by side we overcome

Like the blade that clipped the wings  
And the plague that's drenched the wind  
It's now our blood in the rising flood  
  
Relentless, all conquering Terra  
Demon's breath will that  
And drown all faith and light  
Blackened clouds bestow our plight  
Raped and marred for their opulence, opulence  
She can and will erase, she will erase  
  
This loss, contagious  
Bury us blood, bury us blood  
Befallen on the masses  
Bury us in blood  
  
Besieged by the coming infliction  
Forever blinded by ignorance  
Forgotten steps we've sealed our own fate  
  
Ignored and jeered the vast warnings  
Demon's breath awakes, demon's breath awakes  
She can and will erase, erase  
  
This loss, contagious  
Bury us blood, bury us blood  
Befallen on the masses  
Bury us in blood  
  
Ruination of the Lost  
Befalls the masses  
Burial us blood  
  
This loss, contagious  
Bury us blood, bury us blood  
Befallen on the masses  
Bury us in blood

A west side run through  
One string away from taking the lead  
We stalked the streets at night  
To live, to feel, to breath  
  
Bring back those days of gold  
Where the torch was ours to bare  
A troubled youth to some  
To us our crown to wear  
  
I see a time  
A sanctity of brothers  
We knew another world  
We knew another world  
  
We knew another  
  
A west side horror  
A torch burned out  
Before his own time  
We close our eyes at night  
To hurt, to heal, to breath  
  
Bring back those days of gold  
Where the torch was ours to bare  
A troubled youth to some  
To us our crown to wear  
  
I see a time  
A sanctity of brothers  
We knew another world  
We knew another world  
  
Bring us back to the day  
Bring us back to our age of innocence  
Our time to live forever  
Our worlds will meet again  
  
Worlds

Crossed a plain that left behind dark days.  
Filled a void that I thought could not be replaced.  
Now gone it seems so out or reach.  
  
I have lived. I have felt.  
It's what we need.  
Gone.  
What have I done?  
Found what I've been looking for.  
One time I believe my eyes. This time.  
  
This time my instincts controlled me.  
No need to search on for any more.  
I feel as one with myself. I look no more.  
  
Now a lifetime decision.  
What will the future hold?  
This time they lied.  
  
I felt you slip away.  
A feeling under my skin.  
I tried again and again.  
I did not save you this time.  
  
Holding on to something that I once believed in.  
Will time show me if this was really meant to be.  
  
Show me what this really means to you  
Fall even though I showed you ev-ery-thing that I stand for.  
I hate everything without you.  
Life falls and crumblers in my hand.  
Faith is dead.  
It's something I can't stand.  
Dreams, hope, gone.  
Just a one time thing.  
Far away are the days that we once shared.  
  
I never thought I could change.  
I would be walking a dead day.  
You believed in me and knew I could change.  
Came in my life and became my best friend.  
Now I have been forced away.  
Unwillingly out on my own.  
I never wanted to lose this much.  
You broke a trust that was our own.  
I feel shattered by the sun.  
Now I'm shattered by the sun.

Hell strikes on solid ground  
Give us the strength to hold our home  
Open the wrath again  
Withstood the fight before,  
Been told to leave it all  
Go where I do not know  
We will stare down the eyes of fire  
  
Like stone we battled the winds  
Beat down and strangled the rains  
We stood to fight till the end  
But mother has breached our defense  
  
Keep rising,  
The devil is rising,  
We lost it all  
The devil is rising  
  
It only took five days for the man to come for me  
I know our faith is strong and belief is all we need  
It was those lonely nights that tried our hearts  
It was those lonely nights that tore us apart  
  
And then our faith grew dim  
It was our solemn sin  
  
Forsaken, in the eyes of fire  
We lost it all-in the eyes of fire

Broken, the seems burst in a rush  
A cataclysmic horror story pens its' lust  
Collision makes a call to change a certain path  
Full disbelief takes its hold  
Delay the wrath  
Delay wrath  
  
This is for the lost  
This is for the fallen  
You will remain in my world until I rest  
  
This unrelenting test  
The sting of memories  
Has chased the shadow dark  
To chase them long enough  
Would end in certain death  
No longer solid ground  
Now grayed the autumn leaf  
A barren road  
  
Upon the pages of our path  
Bringing great calamity  
Contagious this loss will surely ruin  
There's great calamity ahead  
  
This is for the lost  
This is for the fallen  
For you'll remain in my world until I rest  
  
Until I rest  
You will remain

This moment,  
One moment  
A time to face hate horror  
A clash,  
Great clash  
The two worlds collide  
The power,  
Vast power  
Each side drives its armies  
The solace,  
No solace  
This is what we've become  
  
The past thou shalt never cross  
Things here will never be the same  
All bear witness to the gathering of the march  
  
This is what we've become  
No solace  
  
This truth,  
One truth  
The underlying reason  
One hope,  
All hope  
The strength of mankind risen  
Our kind,  
Their kind  
Once one,  
Now shattered  
Unite,  
Unite  
We hold the key to tomorrow  
  
The past thou shalt never cross  
Things here will never be the same  
All bear witness to the gathering of the march  
  
Bring them down  
Take it back
