Skip de skip, up the road  
Off to school we go  
"Don't you be a bad boy Johnny  
Don't you slip up  
  
Or play the fool"  
"Oh no Ma, Oh no Da,  
I'll be your golden boy  
I will obey ev'ry golden rule"  
  
Get told by the teacher  
Not to day-dream  
Told by my mother:  
  
Be good Be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good be good (Johnny)  
Be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good (Johnny)  
Be good be good.  
  
"Are you going to play football this year, John?"  
"No!"  
"Oh, well you must be going to play cricket this year then,  
Are you Johnny?"  
"No! no! no!"  
"Boy, you sure are a funny kid, Johnny, but I like you! So tell me,  
What kind of a boy are you, John?"  
  
I only like dreaming  
All the day long  
Where no one is screaming  
  
Be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good be good (Johnny)  
Be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
  
Be good be good be good  
Be good be good be good  
Johnny!

Sometimes the sun shines  
And I close the blinds  
'Cause I can't stand to see the light of day  
I have no use for pain  
  
But I don't mind the rain  
'Cause I can stare outside and hear the sound  
Today I looked right down to the ground  
With nothing in between to break my fall  
  
I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
  
[Chorus]  
Gotta form a plan of attack  
Can't stop to look back I know  
You are so far from here  
Gotta be strong in my mind  
Not encroach on your time I know that  
That would be wrong for sure  
  
I must get out and about  
Of that I have no doubt  
There surely must be new places to go  
Sights I've never seen  
  
All with pastures green  
'Cause the old ones are making me blue for you  
'Cause I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
  
And I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
  
Gotta form a plan of attack  
Climb back on the track I know  
Bid my devil friend good-bye  
Hope I'm still in the race  
  
But I don't know what to chase oh no  
And you're still so far from here  
  
The sun it still shines in  
And I shall close the blinds  
'Cause I know I won't see you anymore, see you anymore  
And I'm blue for you, blue for you  
  
I don't know what to do  
'Cause I'm blue for you, blue for you  
I don't know what to do  
I don't know  
I could take a big jump

Experience babe, kickin' stones and cans  
Experience babe, cigarette-stained hands  
It's not too late, hear it in the wind  
It's not too late, feel passion creepin' in  
Intoxication, familiar smells of the hotels  
Infatuation, of knowing who you are  
  
You and I, you and I, you and I,  
Arrow through my heart,  
Catch a star.  
  
Isolation, rows and rows of cars  
Isolation, like Jupiter and Mars  
Staring faces, set in celluloid  
Welcome to the late show, starring Null and Void  
Complications, things get in the way  
Sweet sensation of knowing you are near and not too far  
  
You and I, you and I, you and I,  
Arrow through my heart  
Catch a star.  
  
You and I, you and I, you and I,  
Freeway through your heart  
Catch a star.  
  
Catch a star!

All the girls and boys have gone away  
They never really had much to say  
They took off all their clothes and their shoes  
Politely asked to be excused  
  
They're the children on parade  
They have a secret they can share  
They're the children on parade  
And nobody knows  
And nobody knows  
  
All the broken toys lie on the floor  
There's no more laughter from down the hall  
Mirror, mirror, mirror on the wall  
Whatever could have happened to them all  
  
They're the children on parade  
They have a secret that they share  
They're the children on parade  
And nobody knows  
And nobody knows  
  
All across the world just yesterday  
All the boys and girls just went away  
They left without their clothes or their shoes  
I'd love to someday hear all the news  
  
About the children on parade  
And all the secrets that they share  
Now they're the children on parade  
And nobody knows...

Down by the sea  
I found your hidden treasure  
Just you and me,  
We overdosed on pleasure  
  
Yonnies in the wind,  
We're ruggin' up for winter  
Putting out the bins  
In cold and windy weather  
  
Down by the docks  
Live all the silent sea-ships  
Crates are stored on blocks  
Where now only the rats live  
  
Sail me down the river  
Till we reach the shore  
Diving into the center  
Eating out the core  
  
Down on the beach  
Saluting Captain Benbow  
Always out of reach  
It's quiet when the tide's low  
  
Climbing up the cliffs  
You can see for miles far  
The boat that ran adrift  
Is sitting on the sandbar  
  
Laughing at the waves  
That storm the river mouth  
The ice is on the move now  
Creeping north and south  
  
Down by the sea  
I found your hidden treasure  
Just you and me  
We over-dosed on pleasure  
  
Listen to your heart  
Screamin' at the sky  
Can't you feel it tremble?  
Don't you wonder why?

Traveling in a fried-out Kombi  
On a hippie trail, head full of zombie  
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous  
She took me in and gave me breakfast  
And she said  
  
Do you come from a land down under?  
Where women glow and men plunder?  
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?  
You better run, you better take cover  
  
Buying bread from a man in Brussels  
He was six-foot-four and full of muscles  
I said, "Do you speak-a my language?"  
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich  
And he said  
  
I come from a land down under  
Where beer does flow and men chunder  
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?  
You better run, you better take cover  
Yeah  
  
Lyin' in a den in Bombay  
With a slack jaw, and not much to say  
I said to the man, "Are you trying to tempt me  
Because I come from the land of plenty?"  
And he said  
  
Do you come from a land down under? (oh yeah yeah)  
Where women glow and men plunder?  
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?  
You better run, you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?  
You better run, you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?  
You better run, you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?  
You better run, you better take cover  
  
Living in a land down under  
Where women glow and men plunder  
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder?  
You better run, you better take cover

Dr. Heckyll works late at the laboratory  
Where things are not as they seem  
Dr. Heckyll wishes nothing more desperately  
Than to fulfill all of his dreams  
Letting loose with a scream in the dead of night  
As he's breaking new ground  
  
Trying his best to unlock all the secrets  
But he's not sure what he's found  
Dr. Heckyll is his own little guinea pig  
'Cause they all think he's mad  
Sets his sights on the search of a lifetime  
And he's never, never sad  
  
Whoa oh, it's off to work he goes  
In the name of science and all its wonders  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
  
Not long now till the ultimate experiment  
He's breaking all the rules  
He wants to cure all matter of imbalance  
In this world of fools  
He locks the door, and he looks around nervously  
He knows there's no one there  
He drinks it down and waits for some reaction  
To all his work and care  
  
Hey, hey, he fumbles for what to say  
He loves the world except for all the people  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
  
Whoa oh, it's out at night he goes  
He slips easily into conversation  
Hey, hey, he's cool in every way  
Sometimes he loves to sing that old black magic  
  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
They are a person who feels good to be alive  
This is the story of Dr. Heckyll and Mr. Jive  
Believes the underdog will eventually survive

Moving up and down and from side to side  
With so many things to do  
I want to go again I want another ride  
This time should see it through  
  
We never realized as the years rolled by  
No we never really had a clue  
But we knew one day we'd come alive  
And in the end there's me and you  
  
My babe, she gives me everything  
She gives me everything I need  
  
When the winter comes and the cold sets in  
As this city's prone to do  
They forecast heavy seas and gale force winds  
That's really nothing new  
  
When I'm falling down  
Deeper than the underground  
My thoughts race back to you  
Again and again  
  
My babe, she gives me everything  
She gives me everything I need  
  
And if you think us fools  
And you criticize  
Then my friend the joke's on you  
  
My babe, she gives me everything  
She gives me everything I need.

By your leave, I think that I'll be going now  
I think I've stayed a little long  
I looked up all my mother's recipes  
I can't think what I did wrong  
  
We go to a restaurant, but you don't like wine  
You say it's love you want, but there is no time  
I realize, I can see it in your eyes  
You keep staring at the floor  
  
I used to look at your school photographs  
But I don't have them anymore  
I wonder who's in my old college rooms  
Or stuck on my old locker door  
  
I dream of the ships at sea, on a stormy night  
I wish that it was me, but I wake in fright  
I realize, I can see it in your eyes  
I've only got myself to blame  
  
Winter kisses when your lips were blue  
Like chasing wild geese in the snow  
Pressing faces on the window panes  
But that's a long long time ago  
  
We go to a restaurant  
You say it's love you want  
I realize, I can see it in your eyes  
You're moving on to something more

I like to pull the plug in the tub  
Sit and watch the water flow down the drain  
I like to, I like to  
I like to look at pictures in a book  
  
Never read the writing just put it down  
I like to, I like to  
  
I'd really like to know  
What would you like to do  
I'd really like to  
  
I like to watch the telly  
With the sound turned down  
Listen to the stereo  
Turn the channels around  
  
I like to, I like to  
I like to eat a sandwich with the lot, yum yum  
Putting on everything that 've got  
I like to, I like to  
  
I'd really like to know  
What would you like to do  
I'd really like to

There's a picture in the hall, I know  
And it's from a time when feelings showed  
Though I hold it close before my eyes  
My heart refuses to see  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
Through the times when two were one completely  
There was another in this well laid plan  
  
This corridor seems to stretch for years ahead  
But patient hearts cannot match times steady tread  
Is this the threshold of a fantasy?  
Is there still life at all?  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
Through the times when two were one completely  
There was another in this well laid plan  
Best laid plan of ours  
  
Watering the garden, some comfort for the twilight years  
Still, life never lingers, it marches past our veil of tears  
A moment's all we've got, to have and to hold  
Don't slip, don't blink, don't turn your head  
  
With a photographic memory  
I could live in a time that used to be  
Is this the threshold of a fantasy?  
Is there still life at all?  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
Through the times when I was won completely  
There was another in this well laid plan  
  
Loving you could have been, oh so easy  
But there is something you don't understand  
There was a time when I was won completely  
Our emotions they got out of hand

Wind is in the east  
Stare at us eyes in wonder  
Like beggars at a feast  
We can't even, count the number  
What you gonna do?  
Send them table scraps we're leaving  
One who care are few  
Most spend there time, with useless meaning  
Dear father,  
Do you think that it will be alright?  
Tell me mother,  
Will we make it through?  
We make it through the hungry night.  
Somewhere in the west  
Gold teeth, but sometime is gleaming  
We know we are the best  
Even know, the beasts lie screaming  
We've got power to spare  
A new clear day  
Is dawning they say  
But tell us, don't you dare  
The piper has a price that we pay  
Dear preacher,  
Do you think that we'll see the light?  
Tell me teacher,  
Well we make it through?  
We make it through the darkest night.  
Two faces in the south  
The first one has a look of  
With fine words in his mouth  
His heart is black,  
As ghetto chimneys  
What you gonna do?  
To hide the shame,  
Contain their anger.  
What you gonna say?  
You walk the line, of constant danger  
Dear brother,  
You think we'll have to stand and fight?  
Tell me sister, Will we make it through?  
We make it through the longest night.  
Dear father,  
Do you think it's gonna be alright?  
Tell me teacher,  
Do you think that we'll see the light?  
Tell me brother,  
You think we'll have to stand and fight?  
Tell me sister,  
Will we make it through?  
Make it through the longest night.
