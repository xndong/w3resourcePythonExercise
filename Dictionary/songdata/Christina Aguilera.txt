She sits alone,  
In the abandon't corner, of her room, (oh her room)  
Lost her life, her lovely past, ooo ooo ooo ooo  
She used to love, feel and have compation,  
But now Her life has lead nowhere, nowhere(hold 4 count)  
(Chorus)  
She feels attached,  
And can't come loose,  
Like strings holding on,  
She can't let go,  
She begs and pleads,  
As she tries to relase,  
And falls to her knees (hold 4 counts)  
  
What's holding her back?  
No one has know,  
Maybe her shadow,  
The shadow of doom,  
She is miserable each day, each week  
While tears begin to run down her cheeks  
Hoping for her day to come, (hold 4 counts)  
For her to pry loose,  
The day has not begun... (o when?)  
(Chorus)  
She feels attached,  
And can't come loose,  
Like strings holding on,  
She can't let go,  
She begs and pleads,  
As she tries to relase,  
And falls to her kneeeees  
(Oh Oh hold last "oh" 4 counts)  
  
Stings, Strings,  
They hold her back,  
No one has notcied,  
Or cared,  
No one knows,  
What's she is really like,  
Deep down inside,  
Oh What's there to hide?  
  
She is nervous, frightened, scared and weak,  
She must peer or peak from that...  
Corner of the room,  
Open her eyes, and face doom (hold doom 4 counts)  
  
(Slower)  
Maybe she has, maybe she did,  
She woke up one day and saw the light,  
Her love and compasion, had all faded away,  
As she ran through her shadow, and began to  
Beg and plead as she fell to her knees and finally,  
She broke loose

Kissing your lips, kissing you top to toe  
Wishing for this, hoping for all we know  
Hearing you breathe, you leave and return  
Oh, how we take, how we give we learn  
  
Taking my time, seeing the signs  
Letting you guide me home  
Watching you grow, letting you know  
You are my only  
  
You bring me hope when I can't breathe  
You give me love, you're all I need  
Slowly I'm holding you closely  
You're wrapped in my arms and you're inside me  
  
Tell you my fears, telling you everything  
Telling the truth to you gives me wings  
Free with my words, free as a bird  
I am flying high looking at you  
  
Everything new, you are my life  
You bring me hope when I can't breathe  
And you give me love, you're all I need  
Slowly I'm holding you closely  
  
So happy to carry you inside me  
I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough  
To inspire you through suffering, holding you up  
I'll feed you, love, and I hope it's enough  
To inspire you through suffering, holding you up  
  
You bring me hope when I can't breathe  
You give me love, you're all I need  
Slowly I'm holding you closely  
You're wrapped in my arms and you're inside me

I've been standing where you left me  
Praying that you'd come and get me  
But now I've found my second wind  
Now I found my second skin  
Well I know what you were thinking  
You thought you'd watch me fade away  
When you broke me into pieces  
But I gave each piece a name  
  
One of me is wiser  
One of me is stronger, one of me is a fighter  
And there's a thousand faces of me  
And we're gonna rise up  
And we're gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Well you're gonna face an army, army of me  
  
Welcome to my revolution  
All your walls are breaking down  
It's time you had a taste of losing  
Time the table's turned around  
I see a glimpse of recognition  
But it's too late ugh it's too late  
And what you though was your best decision  
Just became your worst mistake  
  
One of me is wiser  
One of me is stronger  
One of me is a fighter  
And there's a thousand faces of me  
And were gonna rise up  
And were gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
Well you're gonna face an army, army of me  
  
So how does it feel  
To know that I beat ya  
That I can defeat ya  
Oh how does it feel  
'Cause it sure feels sweeter  
It should be sweeter to me  
Now that I'm wiser  
Now that I'm stronger  
Now that I'm a fighter  
There's a thousand faces of me  
And I'm gonna rise up  
I'm gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
There's a thousand faces of me  
And I'm gonna rise up  
Yeah I'm gonna rise up  
For every time you broke me  
You're gonna face an army  
Army of me

You got what I want boy, and I want it!  
So keep on givin' it up!  
  
Tell your mother, your brother, your sister, and your friend.  
And the others, your lovers, better not be present tense.  
Cause I want everyone to know that you are mine and no one else's!

Think I'm steel, tough as nails  
Never feel, never fail  
But you're wrong  
So damn wrong  
Feel the weight, of your hate  
I still bleed, my heart aches  
As you take  
And You take  
  
Words cut through my skin  
Tears roll down my chin  
My walls crumble within  
But I'll take it all on  
And get up when I fell  
Till the last curtain call  
  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Aren't you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when I'm down  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
  
So you're cold, made of ice  
Heart of stone, born to fight  
But I cry  
I still cry  
Are you happy, you know  
I'm unhappy, you know  
Take your shot  
I'm wide open  
  
Words cut through my skin  
Tears roll down my chin  
My walls crumble within  
But I'll take it all on  
And get up when I fell  
Till the last curtain call  
  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Said you'll never get the best of me, no more  
Aren't you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when I'm down  
But you'll never get the best of me, no more  
  
But you'll never get the best of me no more  
Said you'll never get the best of me no more  
Aren't you tired of throwing stones  
Trying to kick me when I'm down  
But you'll never get the best of me no more  
  
Heartbroken an beaten  
Knocked down and mistreated

And I will never repeat it  
I will rise and defeat it

Knocked down and mistreated

This-this-this-this is the moment that I take over your mind frame  
Step into the picture that I paint you to my brain game  
I let her date you so I give you a migraine  
Over and over, put it on me, later you're insane  
This is a roller coaster that's about to be long gone  
Once you jump in, we're gonna get up on the lump and hold on  
Just let it go, get it up, allow yourself to transform  
Follow me, follow me to a place I know of no return  
  
Are you ready, ready, ready to go?  
Are you ready, ready, ready to go?  
  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh  
  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh  
  
I-I-I-I-I am the future, put it on you like a hurricane  
Call me the supernova that's taking over all time and space  
I'm testing your dimension, can't keep up with what I create  
I'll break your concentration, imagination with what I make  
Many times imitated, not duplicated, can't be replaced  
Na-na-now, lemme spell it out, everybody can shout my name,  
X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A  
(Say) X-X-X-T-T-T-I-I-I-N-N-N-A-(say)-A-A-(say)  
  
Are you ready, ready, ready to go?  
  
Bionic, take it supersonic, eh

Bionic, take it supersonic, eh  
I'm bionic, hit you like a rocket, eh-ay-yeh  
Bionic, so damn bionic, eh  
Gonna get you with my electronic, supersonic rocket, eh

So-what am I not supposed to have an opinion  
Should I keep quiet just because I'm a women  
Call me a bitch cause I speak what's on my mind  
Guess it's easier for you to swallow if I sat and smiled  
  
When a female fires back suddenly big talker don't know how to act  
So he does what every little boy would do  
Makin' up a few false rumors or two  
That for sure is not a man for me, slanderin' names for popularity  
It's sad you only get your fame through controversy  
But now it's time for me to come and give you more to say  
  
[Chorus]  
This is for my girls all around the world  
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth  
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard  
So what do we do girls, shout out loud  
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your hands high and wave 'em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can, never will  
Can't hold us down  
  
Nobody can hold us down  
Never can, never will  
  
So-what am I not supposed to say what I'm saying  
Are you offended with the message I'm bringin'  
Call me whatever 'cause you words don't mean a thing  
Guess you ain't even a man enough to handle what I sing  
If you look back in history it's a common double standard os society  
The guy gets all the glory the more he can score  
While the girl can do the same yet you call her a whore  
I don't understand why it's OK,  
The guy can get a way with it the girl gets named  
All my ladies come together and make a change  
And start a new beginning for us, everybody sang  
  
[Chorus]  
This is for my girls all around the world  
Who have come across a man that don't respect your worth  
Thinkin' all women should be seen and not heard  
So what do we do girls, shout out loud  
Lettin 'em know were gonna stand our ground  
So lift your ahnds high and wave 'em proud  
Take a deep breath and say it loud  
Never can, never will  
Can't hold us down  
  
Here's something I just can't understand  
If the guy have three girls then he's the man  
He can even give her some head, or sex her off  
But if a girl do the same, she's a whore  
But the tables about to turn  
I bet my fame on it  
Cats take my ideas, and put their name on it  
It's aight though, you can't hold me down  
I got to keep on moving  
To my girls to their man who be trying to mac  
Do it right back to him and let that be that  
You need to let him know that his game is whack  
And Lil' Kim and Christina Aguilera got yo back  
  
You're just a little boy  
Think you so cute, so coy  
You must talk so big to make up for smaller things  
You're just a little boy  
All you do is annoy  
You must talk big to make up for smaller things  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Uh, oh oh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh  
Can't hold us down  
  
Yeah, we here, we back again, yeah,  
Lil Kim and Christina Aguilera  
  
Can't hold us down

Y'all small tuna fish, I'm one big catch  
(This is a Shark Tale exclusive)  
Y'all small tuna fish, I'm one big catch  
(Here we go again)  
Y'all small tuna fish, I'm one big catch  
(Say what, say what, yeah)  
Y'all small tuna fish, I'm one big catch

At the car wash (sing it with me now)  
Working at the car wash, yeah

In glory a soldier I stand 'til the end  
A golden revolver I hold in my hand  
The trigger that I never squeeze  
The war that brings me to my knees  
  
I'm tired of fighting for peace  
When I am alone on the front line  
I need you to stand next to me  
  
Baby ceasefire, fire, fire

So please ceasefire, fire, fire  
Ceasefire make it stop  
  
Drop down your defenses I'm raising my flag  
This fighting is hopeless we need this to end  
It's going too far don't know where it began  
We're hurting each other and I can't pretend  
  
I'm trying to help you to see  
The casualties that we both lead  
It's all so unnecessary  
Can't you hear me scream

All i get is mixed signals from you,  
But you never give me a simple clue!  
Im stuck in a well with tear drops falling,  
My guide out is your voice but i don't hear your calling!  
I always hear through the grape vine,  
That you you talk about me all the time.  
  
Chours  
  
Where do i turn for shelter from this heartbreaking storm.  
I used to be able to turn to you to keep me safe and warm!  
But now she came in the picture,  
And ripped our future from my grasp,  
why can't you say, you want me back,  
So everything can be like our past....  
And love me again!

Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
  
When I was young every Christmas Eve  
I could not sleep  
Trying to catch that old St. Nick  
Leaving presents under my tree  
And every year I'd fall asleep laying in my bed  
Dreaming of a million sugarplums  
Dancing in my head  
  
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time  
The spirit of giving is in our lives  
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love  
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because  
  
There'll be family and Christmas cheer (oh ooh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men (ooh)  
Everybody is home for Christmas  
Everybody is home (everybody is home)  
Sneaking a kiss under the mistletoe  
I want a white Christmas so let it snow (let it snow)  
Everybody is home for Christmas (oooh)  
Everybody is home for Christmastime  
  
Friends come together as we decorate the tree  
This is the time of year to live in harmony  
Angels watch over as we put the kids to sleep  
And when they awake their smiling faces  
Make it all complete, oh  
  
This is the holiday you're with the family  
We put aside our differences and let it be  
Oh, oh how much fun it is to give and to receive  
This time of year, love is all we need, ohh  
  
There'll be family (family) and Christmas cheer (oh)  
Peace and goodwill to all men

It's Christmas time  
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
Fa la la la la, fa la la la la la la  
  
Open your heart now  
This is the time for us to give  
The world needs love now  
So live and let live, families all here  
The spirit is good cheer, the sound of carolers  
Ringing sweet in my ear, everything is all fine  
You know why, it's Christmastime, what  
  
Oh how much joy it is at Christmas time  
The spirit of giving is in our lives  
Oh, oh how much joy it brings to see the ones you love  
This year's gonna be the best Christmas because  
  
There'll be family (family) and Christmas cheer (oh)

I'm leaving today  
Living it  
Leaving it  
To change  
  
Slowly drifting  
Into a peaceful breeze  
Tongue tied and twisted  
Are all my memories  
Celebrating a fantasy come true  
Packing all my bags  
Finally on the move  
  
I'm leaving today  
I'm living it  
Oh I'm leaving it  
To change  
  
As I'm driving  
I'm captured by the view  
So much beauty  
The road becomes my muse  
The heat is rising  
And my hand surfs through the wind  
Cool, calm, collected  
Is the child that lies within  
  
See I'm leaving today  
I'm living it  
Oh I'm leaving it  
To change, oh yeah  
  
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm  
Living it  
Oh I'm leaving it  
To change  
  
But somehow I miss it  
I think I'll really miss it  
One day, oh  
  
I turn up the radio  
And I'm feeling like I've never felt before  
Turn down the memories of  
Yester-years and broken dreams I bring  
Finally free, ooh  
  
Slowly drifting  
Into a peaceful breeze, oh  
Oh  
  
Ooh yeah  
I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm  
Living it, oh yeah  
Leaving it to change  
To change, oh no  
  
See I'm leaving today, oh yes I'm  
Living it, living it  
Leaving it, leaving  
To change  
Oh oh  
  
I'm leaving today  
Oh I'm living it  
I'm leaving it to change  
Living it, to change  
Leaving it  
To change  
Ooh, oh yeah  
  
Living it, leaving it  
Said I'm living it  
I'm leaving it  
Living it, leaving it  
To change  
I'm leaving it to change  
  
But somehow I miss it  
I think I'll really miss it  
One day, yeah

For me and you, to get through  
And I know, that with your hand in mine  
There's not a goal, we can't reach in time

In the middle of the night.  
And I don't know if I've been sleeping  
But I hold my pillow tight.  
Are you real or are you  
My imagination playing games?  
I can't set you free  
You'll always be my eternal flame.  
  
Your dreamy eyes...  
They just won't say goodbye.  
Well it must be my fate  
'Cause I just can't escape.  
And the passion never dies  
Oh dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just can't reach you, dreamy eyes.  
  
Your dreamy eyes...  
They just won't say goodbye.  
Well, it must be my fate  
'Cause I just can't escape.  
And the passion never dies  
Oh, dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just can't reach you, dreamy eyes.  
  
You're a vision of tomorrow  
And a ghost from yesterday  
And I'll be trying not to let you  
Take my breath away  
You're a summer breeze that comes and goes  
But somehow lingers on  
Tell me how can I forget you  
If you're never really gone  
What do I have to do  
To get that close to you  
And your- your dreamy eyes  
Oh, I try so hard to release you  
I just keep seeing your dreamy eyes.  
  
Your dreamy eyes...  
They just won't say goodbye.  
Well, it must be my fate  
'Cause I just can't escape.  
And the passion never dies  
Oh, dreamy eyes  
No matter how I try  
I just can't reach you, dreamy eyes.

Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
Racing to the top with golden rays of light  
I never felt so free and yet so dangerous  
The night was electronic painted red with lust  
  
I move, you chase, we magnetize  
A time I was exploding with no warning sign  
  
[Chorus]  
Dynamite  
Electrify me all night  
Dynamite  
Just give it to me, I won't bite  
Dynamite  
You make me feel, it's alright  
Dynamite  
Shine it on me  
  
Caught up in this moment I was hypnotized  
Shake this feeling got me paralyzed  
I do, I don't, I think I might  
My body was electric like a flashing light  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A change, a change is coming  
A change, a change is coming  
  
All around me that a change is bout to happen  
The energy igniting has become my inspiration  
If you take a deeper look you'll find the information  
I'm only just a figment of controlled imagination  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) Electrify me  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) I won't bite  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh) Just give it to me  
(o-o-uh, o-o-uh, o-o-uh o-uh o-uh)  
  
Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
(o-o-uh o-uh o-uh) Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
(o-o-uh o-uh o-uh) Dancing til the morning on a velvet sky  
(Yeah, give it to me)  
(Uh, oh)  
(Uh, oh)

A rubber band is what I call your love for me  
'Cause it comes and goes and pins me like a trampoline  
But all this back and forth is freaky, it's confusing me  
Like a pencil trying to write and you're erasing me  
  
If I was a ruler I'd set you straight  
But your love is like a sharpener, it really grates  
'Cause once I'm trying to bounce, you pull me back  
And when I try to come to you, you give me slack  
  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
  
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la, la  
  
A rubber band was an analogy  
You can even say it's a metaphor  
The tension between you and me  
I ain't gonna feel it if you let it go  
  
I can take a little bit and make it more  
A little bit of hate can make it war  
But a lot of love ain't enough  
And so, I don't really know how we find the cure  
  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
  
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together  
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together  
Paper clips, they couldn't even hold us together  
  
If we were gaffer tape maybe we could spend the summer  
You could say your piece, you could post it on a paper  
When your love hits, it sticks me like a stapler  
  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
Your love is pulling like a rubber band  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love  
Elastic love, everlastic love  
Ever lusting love, such a spastic love

Where I've been all my life...  
  
The dress is Chanel  
The shoes ysl  
The bag is Dior  
Agent Provocateur  
My address today, la by the way  
Above Sunset Strip, the hills all the way  
  
My rings are by Webster  
It makes the heads twirl  
They all say, "Darling, what did you do for those pearls?"  
"What"! I am a good girl The age I adore, the day oh no more  
Breakfast Polo Launch and pools at the shore  
The Chateau for cocktails  
The Courtyard at night  
Downtown is for dinner  
The hell is divine  
You know I have found the words goin' round  
They all say my feet never do touch the ground  
"What"! I am a good girl...

The funny thing about hurt people  
Is they tend to hurt people  
The funny thing about lies is  
They're only lies  
The funny thing about hearts is  
They tend to break easy  
The funny thing about healing is  
I'm alright  
  
Your voice is like a knife  
It used to make me cry  
You tried to cut my pride  
Not this time  
  
So go ahead and say the things you got to say  
You know you're only throwing empty words my way  
Cause you won't break me you won't break me  
You can't take me down  
No  
  
The funny thing about listening is  
I don't have to hear you and the  
Funny thing about talking is your words are tired  
Now I've come to realise that  
Life can be cruel but  
The only approval that I need is mine  
  
Your voice is like a knife  
It used to make me cry  
You tried to cut my pride  
Not this time  
  
So go ahead and say the things you got to say  
You know you're only throwing empty words my way  
Cause you won't break me you won't break me  
You can't take me down  
No  
  
So go ahead and say the things you got to say  
You know you're only throwing empty words my way  
Cause you won't break me you won't break me  
You can't take me down  
No  
  
The hardest part of this  
Cannot be heard or seen  
This journey starts when I begin loving me  
  
So go ahead and say the things you got to say  
You know you're only throwing empty words my way  
Cause you won't break me you won't break me  
You can't take me down  
No  
  
So go ahead and say the things you got to say  
You know you're only throwing empty words my way

Ladies and gentlemen  
Boys and girls  
Step right up, step right up  
Come closer, you won't believe your eyes  
Behind this curtain  
Witness something you've never seen before  
Heard before, dreamt before  
The most amazing show on earth  
  
La la la la la la la  
It's the most amazing show on earth  
La la la la la la la  
  
Do you want to be widely entertained  
People to know your name?  
Do you crave fame?  
Well, they say things aren't always what they seem to be  
Even your greatest fantasies  
You won't believe your eyes  
Won't even recognize  
The wonderment that lies  
Behind the shimmer and the lights  
  
Is it true what they say?  
Is it all just fun and games?  
Or is there more behind the makeup  
And the faces full of paint?  
  
I ask you, do you want to come and play?  
Ha ha ha ha  
Get the world to come and play  
Ha ha ha ha  
  
So sit back, relax, fasten your seat belts  
It's going to be a bumpy ride to the other side

It's a cold and crazy world that's ragin' outside  
Well baby me and all my girls are bringin' on the fire  
Show a little leg, gotta shimmy your chest  
It's a life, it's a style, it's a need, it's Burlesque  
  
E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex  
Ladies no regrets  
E-X-P-R-E-S-S, love, sex  
Ladies no regrets  
  
Been holdin' back for quite some time and finally the moment's right  
I love to make the people stare  
They know I got that certain savoir-faire  
  
Fasten up  
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch?  
Step into the fantasy  
You'll never want to leave, baby it's guarantee  
Why?  
  
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque  
It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque  
All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it  
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's Burlesque.  
  
I tease 'em 'til they're on the edge  
They screamin' more for more and more they beg  
I know it's me they come to see  
My pleasure brings them to their knees  
  
Fasten up  
Can you imagine what would happen if I let you close enough to touch?  
Step into the fantasy  
You'll never want to leave, baby let's give it to you  
Why?  
  
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque  
It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque  
All ladies, confident, flaunt it  
Boys throw it up if you want it  
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's Burlesque.  
  
(Woo, dance break!)  
  
It's a passion, and emotion, it's a fashion, Burlesque  
It'll move you, goin' through you, so do what I do, Burlesque  
All ladies come put your grown up, boys throw it up if you want it  
Can you feel me, can you feel it? It's Burlesque.

Well I thought I knew you, thinkin' that you were true  
Guess I, I couldn't trust called your bluff time is up  
'Cause I've had enough  
You were there by my side, always down for the ride  
But your joy ride just came down in flames cause your greed sold me out in
shame  
  
After all of the stealing and cheating you probably think that  
I hold resentment for you  
But uh uh, oh no, you're wrong  
'Cause if it wasn't for all that you tried to do, I wouldn't know  
Just how capable I am to pull through  
So I want to say thank you  
Cause it  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause it makes me that much stronger  
Makes me work a little bit harder  
It makes me that much wiser  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
Made me learn a little bit faster  
Made my skin a little bit thicker  
Makes me that much smarter  
So thanks for making me a fighter  
  
Never saw it coming, all of your backstabbing  
Just so you could cash in on a good thing before I'd realize your game  
I heard you're goin' round playin', the victim now  
But don't even begin feeling I'm the one to blame  
'Cause you dug your own grave  
After all of the fights and the lies cause you're wanting to haunt me  
But that won't work anymore, no more,  
It's over  
'Cause if it wasn't for all of your torture  
I wouldn't know how to be this way now and never back down  
So I want to say thank you  
Cause it  
  
[Chorus]  
  
How could this man I thought I knew  
Turn out to be unjust so cruel  
Could only see the good in you  
Pretended not to know the truth  
You tried to hide your lies, disguise yourself  
Through living in denial  
But in the end you'll see  
You won't stop me  
  
I am a fighter and I  
I ain't goin' stop  
There is no turning back  
I've had enough  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You thought I would forget,  
But I remember  
'Cause I remember  
I remember  
You thought I would forget,  
But I remember  
'Cause I remember  
I remember  
  
[Chorus]

You know who you are  
This is for you  
  
Hmmm, yeah, ooh yeah, ohh  
  
I thought I knew who you were  
I see now you were a lesson to learn  
And all I am to you now is a bridge that's been burned  
Now I was the first to believe  
I made you part of my musical dream  
And your thanks to me, came without an apology, yeah  
  
We wrote Loving Me 4 Me, don't Walk Away  
Can't Hold Us Down, all part of our history  
Don't forget Infatuation, I'm a Fighter  
Feeling Underappreciated  
  
Yeah, this song is for you to remind you  
That I moved on, sang my songs,  
I've got no regrets  
  
Mmm, oh  
  
Hope it all was worth it, uh  
Looks like I didn't need you  
Still got the album out  
Ha

I feel like I've been locked up tight  
A century of lonely nights  
Waiting, waiting for someone  
  
You're licking your lips  
And blowing kisses my way  
That don't mean I'm gonna give it away  
Baby, oh baby  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
The music's playin'  
And the lights down low  
One more dance and then we're good to go  
Waitin', waitin' for someone  
  
My hormones racin' at the speed of light  
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight  
Baby, ooh baby  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
Gotta make a big impression  
Gotta like what you do  
Gotta like what you do  
Gotta like what you do  
  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
You gotta make a big impression  
Gotta like what you do  
  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
I'm a genie in a bottle, baby  
  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My heart is sayin' no)  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My heart is sayin' no)  
  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My heart is sayin' no)  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out  
(My body's sayin' let's go)  
Come on, come on, come on and let me out

I feel like I've been locked up tight  
For a century of lonely nights  
Waiting for someone to release me  
You're lickin' your lips  
And blowing kisses my way  
But that don't mean I'm gonna give it away  
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby)  
  
Ooh, my body's sayin' let's go  
Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me  
I can make your wish come true  
You gotta make a big impression (Oh yeah)  
Gotta like what you do  
  
(I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Gotta rub me the right way honey  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come, come on and let me out)  
  
The music's fading and the lights down low  
Just one more dance and then we're good to go  
Waiting for someone  
Who needs me  
Hormones racing at the speed of light  
But that don't mean it's gotta be tonight  
Baby, baby, baby (Baby baby baby)  
  
Ooh, my body's sayin' let's go  
Ooh, but my heart is sayin' no (but my heart is sayin' no)  
  
If you wanna be with me  
Baby there's a price to pay  
I'm a genie in a bottle (I'm a genie in a bottle)  
You gotta rub me the right way  
  
If you wanna be with me (Oh)  
I can make your wish come true (Your wish come true oh)  
Just come and set me free baby  
And I'll be with you

Gotta rub me the right way honey  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby  
Come come, come on and let me out)  
  
I'm a genie in a bottle baby

"Isn't it strange  
That the stars don't shine no more now since you're gone  
Isn't it strange  
That we kinda look back and say just what went wrong  
  
I wanna know where we are  
Should I pretend and let things be  
I wanna know when what you've done  
Could you come face to face with me  
  
Isn't it strange  
That you told me one thing suddenly changed your mind  
Isn't it strange  
That you called me for me turn away and leave me behind  
  
Now it feels like I'm drowning  
Feels like I'm drowning without you  
I know the feeling  
'Cause I felt this all before..  
  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
  
Isn't it strange  
That the world seems to turn away when I try to explain  
What's so strange  
That two can't be as one....  
  
Now it feels like I'm drowning  
Feels like I'm drowning without you  
I know the feeling  
'Cause I felt this all before  
And it feels like I'm dying  
Feels like I'm dying now I know the truth  
  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
Don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
  
Don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
I hope you're happy  
Don't feel just like me  
I hope you don't feel just like me  
Fuck I hope you feel much worse than me  
Maybe not so happy  
Not so happy, yeah, not so happy, yeah  
Not so happy, welcome to my world  
Not so happy, yeah, not so happy, yeah  
Not so happy, welcome to my world"

Seems like it was yesterday when I saw your face  
You told me how proud you were, but I walked away  
If only I knew what I know today  
Ohhh ohhh  
  
I would hold you in my arms  
I would take the pain away  
Thank you for all you've done  
Forgive all your mistakes  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To hear your voice again  
Sometimes I want to call you, but I know you won't be there  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself by hurting you  
Some days I feel broke inside, but I won't admit  
Sometimes I just want to hide 'cause it's you I miss  
You know it's so hard to say goodbye when it comes to this  
  
Would you tell me I was wrong?  
Would you help me understand?  
Are you looking down upon me?  
Are you proud of who I am?  
There's nothing I wouldn't do  
To have just one more chance  
To look into your eyes and see you looking back  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself  
  
If I had just one more day, I would tell you how much that  
I've missed you since you've been away  
  
Oh, it's dangerous  
It's so out of line to try to turn back time  
  
I'm sorry for blaming you for everything I just couldn't do  
And I've hurt myself  
  
By hurting you

I am timid  
And I am oversensitive  
I am a lioness  
I am tired and defensive  
You take me in your arms  
And I fold into you  
I have insecurities  
You show me I am beautiful  
  
Love me or leave me just take it or leave it  
It's not that I'm needy just need you to see me  
Take me, free me, see through to the core of me  
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending  
  
I am temperamental  
And I have imperfections  
And I am emotional  
I am unpredictable  
I am naked  
I am vulnerable  
I am a woman  
I am opening up to you  
  
Love me or leave me, just take it or leave it  
It's not that I'm needy, just need you to see me  
Take me, free me, see through to the core of me  
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending  
  
Now I stand before you with my heart in my hands  
I'm asking you to take me just the way that I am  
  
Please lay down your arms  
Do you know me?  
Make me feel safe from harm  
  
Oh just take me, free me, see through to the core of me  
Take me, free me, there will be no more pretending  
  
I am temperamental  
And I have imperfections  
And I am emotional  
There'll be no more pretending

All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been livin in a fantasy without meaning  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
  
I Don't Feel Safe Oohhh  
  
Left broken empty in despair  
Wanna breathe can't find air  
Thought you were sent from up above  
But you and me never had love  
So much more I have to say  
Help me find a way  
  
And I wonder if you know  
How it really feels  
To be left outside alone  
When it's cold out here  
Well maybe you should know  
Just how it feels  
To be left outside alone  
To be left outside alone  
  
I'll tell you  
All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been living in a fantasy without meaning  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
I need to pray  
  
Why do you play me like a game?  
Always someone else to blame  
Careless, helpless little man  
Someday you might understand  
There's not much more to say  
But I hope you find a way  
  
Still I wonder if you know  
How it really feels  
To be left outside alone  
When it's cold out here  
Well maybe you should know  
Just how it feels  
To be left outside alone  
To be left outside alone  
  
I'll tell you  
All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been living in a fantasy without meaning  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
I need to pray  
  
Oohhh ohhh Pray!  
  
Heavenly father please save me (heavenly fathers Save me!)  
  
Oohhh oohhhh ohh  
  
And I wonder if you know  
How it really feels  
To be left outside alone  
When it's cold out here  
Well maybe you should know  
Just how it feels  
To be left outside alone  
To be left outside alone  
  
Oohhhhh ohhhh  
  
All my life I've been waiting  
For you to bring a fairytale my way  
Been living in a fantasy without meaning Oh!  
It's not okay I don't feel safe  
I need toooo praayy!

I wanna tell you my secret  
With just the sound of my breathing  
I wanna know your hearts beating  
I wanna tell ya, I wanna tell ya  
  
Ah ooh like that  
Yeah it feels so good that I can't hold back  
Ah ooh like that  
Hit the right spot, making my eyes roll back  
  
Let there be let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)  
  
Let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)  
  
Want you to tell me you need it  
I wanna hear it repeated  
Want you to take me completely  
Want you to tell me  
Want you to tell me  
  
Ah ooh like that  
Yeah it feels so good that I can't hold back  
Ah ooh like that  
Hit the right spot, making my eyes roll back  
  
Let there be let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)  
  
Let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)  
  
Let there be let there be love  
Let there be let there be love  
Let there be let there be love  
Let there be let there be love  
  
(Let's go) Let there be love  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
Oh yeah  
  
Let there be let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)  
  
Let there be love  
Here in the here in the dark  
Turning me turning me on  
Not gonna fight anymore  
'Cause I want your touch (Let's go)

So the pain begins  
As the music fades  
And I'm left here with  
With more than I can take  
  
If you lift me up  
Just get me through this night  
I know I'll rest tomorrow  
And I'll be strong enough to try  
  
When the static clears  
And all is said and done  
I will realize  
That we all need someone  
  
If you lift me up  
Just get me through this night  
I know I'll rest tomorrow  
And I'll be strong enough to try  
  
So when you see me crashing  
And there's nowhere left to fall  
Will you lift me even higher  
To rise above this all  
  
If you lift me up  
Said if you lift me up  
  
Whoo-yeah, ah-yeah  
Whoo-yeah, ah-yeah  
  
Said if you lift me up  
Will you lift me higher  
  
When you see me crashing  
And there's nowhere left to fall  
Will you lift me even higher  
To rise above this all  
  
If you lift me up  
Said if you lift me up  
If you lift me up  
Just get me through this night

We are the stars up in the sky  
We light the darkness you and I  
We are the flicker in the night  
Never shine so bright  
  
We are the strong and though we fall  
We fought for love we risked it all  
Never back down against the walls  
It's what we're living for yeah  
  
Keep on rising higher  
Blazing through the fire  
Right down to the wire  
Rise the fire higher  
As we stand together  
Chase our dreams forever  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Although the road ahead was long  
I was too weak to carry on  
You picked me up you were my home  
I never stood alone  
  
No one can tell us what we want  
No one can stop us anymore  
No looking back we're moving forward  
No one can take this moment away  
  
Keep on rising higher  
Blazing through the fire  
Right down to the wire  
Rise the fire higher  
As we stand together  
Chase our dreams forever  
Forever, forever, forever  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
When skies are grey  
I'll light your way  
I'll be your shoulder  
You can lean on me  
  
When skies are grey  
I'll light your way  
I'll be your shoulder  
You can lean on me  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
Now we have wings we can fly  
We can be kings you and I  
Wipe away the tears from our eyes  
We light up the sky  
  
We light up the sky  
Light up the sky  
We light up the sky  
We light up the sky

Hey there boy did ya happen to know  
Wherever you go I'll follow  
Ooh babe you're like a cool breeze  
On a summer day  
When you're near me  
I don't know what to do  
I feel like a fool  
Like a schoolgirl  
True blue girl  
Who wants to know  
Can you come out and play  
You make me feel the way  
A woman is supposed to feel  
Show you that my love's for real  
  
I'll be the rain in your summer  
The chill in your fall  
I'll be what ya want  
Anything at all  
I've got a love for all seasons  
A love for all time  
I'll be the fire in your winter  
The sun in your spring  
I'll do what you want  
Give ya everything  
I've got a love for all seasons  
A love for all time  
  
I'll be there for you  
Keeping you warm  
Through the storm  
I'll guide you  
Stand by you until the stars fall from the sky  
When you call me  
I never hesitate  
Making you wait for my love  
Never lie love  
It's something that I just can't deny  
I'll read your each and every feeling  
When you need me to  
So now I gotta let you know  
This love's for you  
  
You don't have to search no more  
Baby you don't have to dream  
Cause what I've got inside for you  
It's all that you'll ever need  
You don't have to search no more  
My heart is yours  
For real for sure  
You don't have to wonder why  
I'll never leave  
I'll never lie

Dolly:  
Horace vandergelder, mrs. horace vandergelder  
Just leave ev'rything to me  
Though it wont be like the first time  
How can it be like the first time?  
But why does it have to be?  
Don't look for shooting stars  
For love is only love  
You touch and still you touch the proud  
Don't listen for those bells  
For love is only love  
And if it's love you've found  
Your heart won't hear a sound  
And you hold his hand  
You only hold his hand  
The violins are all a bluff  
But if you're really wise  
The silence of his eyes  
Will tell you  
Love is only love  
And it's wonderful enough  
Without the shooting star  
Without the sounds of bells  
Without the violins  
Love is wonderful enough!

I can't believe what you did to me  
Down on my knees and I need to break free  
All these years you violated me  
(violated me)  
I don't know why I can't feel inside  
I try to hide can't make it alright, it's overkill  
Now I'm ready to fight  
(ready to fight)  
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
I just want to get away  
Savin' all your bullshit for another day  
  
Feeling confined like I'm bin' force fed  
My visions blurry and I'm lost in regrets  
It's overloaded and I'm outta control  
(outta control)  
So sick and tired of bein' so misused  
(so misused)  
You're taking me down with all your mental abuse  
And I said, I gotta get you outta my head  
Everybody's always trying to look me over  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
[Chorus]  
I just want to get away  
Saving all your bullshit for another day  
I'm the only one that can rescue me from me  
  
Leaving the house around quarter to five  
Zipped up my boots and I'm ready to ride  
And I feel so high, and I feel so alice  
Let my hair down feel the wind on my skin  
Crossin' the border where my new life begins  
And I close my eyes and take it all in  
I don't need nobody tryin' to make me over  
(Don't make me over)  
I just want to live simple and free  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You want to break me down [Repeat: x3]

(Fight the darkness sing the song)  
(Fight the darkness sing the song)  
(Fight the darkness sing the song)  
(Move it, move it, move it, move it)

Imagine what two could do (turn it up)

When was the last time  
You called me on the phone?  
Said you love me  
And said you needed me  
When was it? Oh baby  
  
It was yesterday  
That I could hide in your arms  
You spoke those those lovely words  
That you want me  
Was that true? I wanna know  
  
Chorus:  
I never knew a love so true so pure so innocent  
But all I have left is sadness and misery  
Those fond memories have left me  
Stripped and I'm in agony  
So why you do this to me?  
  
It seems like I've trusted you  
Broken and torn are my heart when I finally see  
You and her staying around that corner  
Whispers of love have left me so alone  
Did you truly love me?  
  
Just the other day  
I saw another her  
She n you in a bus sharing every pleasant thing in the world  
I was so emotional I wanted to see you so much  
But now it seems that all is gone  
I guess I must move on  
  
Chorus  
  
How can a boy like you act like a man?  
Come back my darlin' and i'll gif you all the happiness  
I love you  
You know its true  
Come back please come back...

Lord, have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked the sinful road  
That I'm down on my knees  
Lord, have mercy on me, please  
  
Oh yeah  
  
Jesus, I must confess  
That in all my loneliness  
I've forsaken, and I've sinned  
Leaving fragments of a man so broken  
  
I could tell you what I've done  
Or should I tell you where I went wrong?  
  
Well, the more that I start to play  
My deceitful, evil ways  
Keep on growing stronger by the day  
  
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked a sinful road  
So I'm gonna get down on my knees  
Beg forgiveness to help set me free  
Lord, have mercy on me, please  
  
Mother Mary full of grace  
In my weakness, I've lost faith  
I've been careless, and I have been warned  
And the devil inside me is torn  
God bless the men that I have scorned  
  
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul  
For I have walked the sinful road  
So I'm gonna get down on my knees  
Beg forgiveness to help set me free  
Lord have mercy on me, please  
  
Whoa, whoa, yeah, yeah  
Whoa, yeah, yeah, oh, oh  
Oh-oh yeah, yeah, yeah, oh  
  
So don't let me fool around no more  
Send your angels down to guide me through that door  
Well, I've gone and confessed my regrets  
And I pray I'm not held in contempt  
I'm so lost, and I need you to help me repent  
  
Oh lord, have mercy on my soul  
Oh, I'm begging, I'm pleading, I'm needing  
I want you to know  
So I'm down upon my knees  
Oh lord, I need forgiveness  
I need forgiveness from you

Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
And never brought to mind  
Should auld acquaintance be forgot  
In days of auld lang syne

While we're standing underneath the mistletoe

This is how it happened  
I saw you  
My dream became reality  
The minute I was by myself  
Then you became a part of me  
Easy come easy go was in my mind  
I was holding on to the past  
Then I realized you were mine  
I knew that we were gonna match  
  
I won't let nobody try to turn me  
From loving you  
I am more than satisfied  
Nobody else is gonna do  
I won't let nobody in my business  
It's all about you  
If you want me here I am  
Cause I'm here for you more than you know  
  
Stay with me  
Don't you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
Stay with me  
Don't you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
  
When I wonder how it would've been  
If I never met you  
I think about if for awhile  
Then I let it go cause I got you  
And my heart's so full of love  
I can not even breathe no  
You're the air to my body  
You're all that I need  
  
I won't let nobody try to turn me  
From loving you  
I am more than satisfied  
Nobody else is gonna do  
I won't let nobody in my business  
It's all about you  
If you want me here I am  
Cause I'm here for you more than you know  
  
Stay with me  
Don't you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
Stay with me  
Don't you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
  
Your the pieces to my puzzle  
Without you I'm incomplete  
The song to my melody  
Sweeter than honey  
If you add all the days of my life  
Multiply by the reasons I love you  
It couldn't measure up to  
How much I really need you  
  
I won't let nobody try to turn me  
From loving you  
I am more than satisfied  
Nobody else is gonna do  
I won't let nobody in my business  
It's all about you  
If you want me here I am  
Cause I'm here for you more than you know  
  
Stay with me  
Don't you go  
I love you tonight more than you know  
Stay with me  
Don't you go  
I love you tonight more than you know

This one  
Can you feel it, feel the groove  
Let the music take control and let your body move  
Just relax and listen to the sound  
Once the music takes you you will finally have found  
It will take you away to another state of mind  
Where peace you'll find inside the sound  
Just escape to a place  
Troubles seem to flow away when you get away  
Get this party going on, the feel of the rhythm  
Gotta, gotta make it strong, leave it going on  
If you wanna get away and ease your mind now  
Come on everybody stay and let the song take you away, yeah  
Alright  
Can you feel it, feel the groove  
Let the music take control and let your body move  
Just relax and listen to the sound  
Once the music takes you you will finally have found  
It will take you away to another state of mind  
Where peace you'll find inside the sound  
Just escape to a place  
Troubles seem to flow away when you get away  
Get this party going on, the feel of the rhythm  
Gotta, gotta make it strong, leave it going on  
If you wanna get away and ease your mind now  
Come on everybody stay and let the song take you away, yeah  
...  

Look at me, you may think you see who I really am  
But you'll never know me  
Every day it's as if I play a part  
Now I see if I wear a mask, I can fool the world  
But I cannot fool my heart  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight back at me  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
I am now in a world where I have to hide my heart  
And what I believe in  
But somehow I will show the world what's inside my heart  
And be loved for who I am  
  
Who is that girl I see  
Staring straight back at me  
Why is my reflection someone I  
Don't know  
Must I pretend that I'm someone else  
For all time  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
  
There's a hope that must be free to fly  
That burns with a need to know the reason why  
Why must we all conceal what we think, how we feel  
Must there be a secret me  
I'm forced to hide  
  
I wont pretend that I'm  
Someone else for all time  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am inside  
When will my reflection show  
Who I am, inside

Not hurting any more  
Yo here we go  
  
You left the door wide open  
It was getting cold  
You never came home last night  
And I was upset  
Feeling lonley and old  
So I wept and cried  
You have cheated and lied  
  
[Chorus:]  
All I wanted was to be with you  
But you wouldn't have it  
You left me alone  
And I got used to it  
And now I'm not hurting anymore  
  
I screamed and I tried  
To get hold of myself  
Get a grip girl  
Because you need a new life  
And all I wanted was you  
But you were with your friends  
And that's were it ends  
  
Repeat chorus  
  
I'm preparing to run away  
I've packed my bags  
And I'm ready to go  
Then I see you  
And I stay  
  
Repeat chorus 2x

Can you hear it in my voice  
Was it something I let slip  
Does the whole world know  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
I'm the one who's in control  
Now I'm acting like a fool  
Do my feelings show?  
Is my face aglow?  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
[Chorus]  
That I don't know what I'm doing anymore  
I'm feeling like a little girl  
Caught up in emotions  
I'm out of control  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
Do you see my hands they tremble  
Wonder why I can't look you in the eyes  
Don't know how long  
I can keep this inside  
Isn't it obvious?  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Suddenly these emotions are in control of my heart  
Can you see it in my eyes  
Every glance, every smile  
Must give me away  
And I feel so much I can't hide  
  
[Chorus]

Oh holy night the stars are brightly shining  
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth, oh yeah  
Now long lay the world in sin and error pining  
Till he appeared and the soul felt its worth  
The thrill of hope the weary world rejoices  
For yonder breaks, a new and glorious morn  
  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angel voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night divine  
  
Our Father, who art in heaven  
Hallowed be Thy name  
Thy kingdom come, thy will be done  
On earth as it is in heaven  
  
Give us this day our daily bread  
And forgive us our trespasses  
As we forgive those who trespass against us  
Lead us not into temptation  
  
But deliver us from evil  
For thine is the kingdom  
The power, and the glory  
For ever and ever, amen  
  
Fall on your knees, oh hear the angels voices  
Oh night divine, oh night when Christ was born  
Oh night divine, oh night  
  
It was a holy, holy night  
(Oh holy night)  
It was a holy night when Jesus Christ was born  
(Oh holy night)  
Holy yes, Jesus Christ  
(Oh holy night)  
  
And the power, and the glory, yeah  
(Oh holy night)  
When Jesus Christ, Jesus Christ  
(Oh holy night)  
He was born on this night, on this night  
(Oh holy night)  
  
Jesus Christ  
(Oh holy night)  
Forever, and ever, and ever, and ever  
(Oh holy night)

Me and you, we're different  
Don't always see eye to eye  
You go left, and I go right  
And sometimes when we even fight  
That don't mean that I won't need a friend, oh  
You and me, we're in this till the end, oh  
  
I think we're on our our way  
Through all the lows and highs  
I need you by my side, singing

I remember that time when I first laid eyes on you  
I looked into your eyes and I knew all my dreams would come true  
With you  
Then you left last summer and rest of your family  
And you left me here all alone for the rest of eternity  
  
Chores  
It's not easy to move on and it's certainly not easy to  
Be as stong as you'd like to be  
Because you left me here with only one memory  
  
How could ya do it how could ya leave knowing what you've done  
How could stand blaming for what I have done  
What I have done  
  
It was a cold night and I was at home crying over you my  
Friends were there to calm me and I got up and I jumped  
Over the balcony  
  
I......  
I blame you my.... My friends do to  
It was all.... All because of you  
Because you left me to find someone new

Alright  
I can see you, from a far  
Taking notice, who you are  
I know that you, can see me too  
But if you plan to make your move  
You better make it soon  
Baby, baby  
What's your hesitation  
Pretty soon you're gonna  
Lose my attention  
I don't know what's going on in your mind  
But you're running out of time  
Running out of time  
Oh, you're running out of time  
You're running out of time  
Oh, you're running, running  
Out of time  
Something like that?  
I can see you, from a far  
Taking notice, who you are  
I know that you, can see me too  
But if you plan to make your move  
You better make it soon  
Baby, baby  
What's your hesitation  
Pretty soon you're gonna  
Lose my attention  
I don't know what's going on in your mind  
But you're running out of time  
Running out of time  
Oh, you're running out of time  
Ohh, you're running out of time

Pretty soon you're gonna  
Lose my attention  
I don't know what's going on in your mind  
But you're running out of time  
Running out of time

Ohh, yeah yeah yeah  

Watchin' lovers walkin'  
Hand in hand they pass me by  
Wish I was one of them  
Wish I had somebody  
  
Wakin' up beside me  
Looking into my eyes at night  
I want a love to call my own  
I want someone that I can hold  
  
Want someone wanting me  
want to feel how it feels to be  
  
[Chorus]  
Somebody's somebody  
Somebody's someone  
Some sweet lover's lover  
I want to be that one  
Someone faithful to someone faithful  
Someone kind to someone kind to me  
Somebody to somebody who loves me  
Who loves me  
  
Spending all of my time  
Spending all my time on me  
Where is that someone who  
I can give my time to  
  
Searching for that lover  
With the love that will change my life  
I want two arms to hold me close  
I want the thing I need most  
  
Somebody needing me  
So I can feel how it feels to be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What I'm looking for  
Is someone to love me more  
Than I've been loved before  
With love so right  
  
What I need to find  
Is someone to hold me tight  
What I mean is i want to be  
  
[Chorus]

How will you praise me, When you're not around,  
You say you love me, then you hit the ground,  
Make up your mind babe, I won't be here long,  
Just let me know babe, when I sing this song.  
  
Chorus  
Don't leave me waiting, time is moving on too fast,  
stop hesistating, cuz our love will never last,  
I'm moving on, don't try to grab me back, I'm moving on..  
  
Boy I'm on my own, cuz you let me cry these tears,  
you walked away, now I can't face none of my fears,  
I need you boy, please come back to me,  
I need you boy please can't you see..  
  
Chorus  
  
Don't leave me waiting oooh I won't stay for you, you let me go too  
Many times, you've let out love goooooo........

Yo  
Woo, ooo  
  
Sorry, if I'm perfect  
Sorry, I don't give a

Sorry, I ain't a diva  
Sorry, just know what I want  
Sorry, I'm not a virgin  
Sorry, I'm not a slut  
(Ohh)  
I won't let you break me  
Think what you want  
(Ohh, aaa, ohh)  
  
To all my dreamers out there  
I'm with you  
To all my underdogs  
Haa, I feel you  
Lift your head high  
And stay strong  
Keep pushin' on

I Love To Go A Wandering  
Along The Mountain Track  
And As I Go, I Love To Sing  
My Knapsack On My Back

So many years have gone by  
Always strong, tried not to cry  
Never felt like I needed any man  
To comfort me in life  
But I'm all made up today  
A veil upon my face  
But no father stands beside me  
To give this bride away  
  
Well, I'm standing in the chapel  
Wearing my white dress  
I have waited for this moment  
With tears of happiness  
Here I leave behind my past  
By taking the chance  
I've finally found the right man  
  
Thoughts racing fast through my mind  
As I'm gazing down the aisle  
That my future will mend the memories  
Torn between father and child  
  
My emotions overload  
'Cause there is no hand to hold  
There's no shoulder here to lean on  
I'm walking all on my own  
  
Here I go  
  
Now I'm standing at four corners  
To have and to hold  
Now, my love, you stand beside me  
To walk life's winding road  
And I owe it all to you  
For taking that chance  
You've shown me there's a right man  
'Cause I never knew the right man  
  
Well, I'm standing in the chapel  
Ready to confess  
That I've waited for this moment  
With tears of happiness  
Now I leave behind my past  
By taking the chance  
Whoa  
  
Well, I'm standing at four corners  
To have and to hold  
Now, my love, you stand beside me  
To walk life's winding road  
And I owe it all to you  
For taking the chance  
  
And one day, my little girl  
Will reach out her hand  
She'll know I found the right man

Over the phone, love to hear  
All of the things you say to me, mmm  
I just can't wait, to hear your voice  
Whispering sweetly to me baby  
All I may want I know you got  
Ready for me to receive, oh  
Making me know that you're there for me  
Feels so, good inside  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
Making me feel, safe from harm  
With your soft and silky tone, mmm  
Can't help but show, how good, yes I know  
That you got it going on  
And never has come, or been a day  
You misled me the wrong way, oh no  
Knowing that you're just a, just a  
A phone, call away, oh  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
I like, the way  
You talk to me  
Is that all?  
Okay  

You'll be my New's Year Day, my valentine  
I ain't gonna stop until I make you mine  
You'll be my April Fool, my Mardi Gras  
The music on my tongue, when I sing fa la la  
  
You'll be my flower child in the month of May  
My sunny summer love on my holiday  
You'll be my autumn leaves, my Halloween  
The winter snow and everything that's in between  
  
This year I'm gonna take you home  
This year I don't want to be alone  
This year, this Christmas, together,  
And the minutes they pass, and the hours, they fly  
This year, this Christmas, forever  
And the weeks and the months go rushing by  
This year we have learned how to live  
How to forget, and how to forgive without fear  
Just love, this Christmas, this year  
  
You'll be my spring ahead, my fall behind  
The shimmy in my hips, oh when I bump and grind  
You'll be my Santa Boy, all dressed in red  
And ride that little reindeer all through my head  
  
Round and round  
Round and round  
Here we go  
  
This year I'm gonna take you home  
This year I don't want to be alone  
This year, this Christmas, together  
And the minutes they pass, and the hours they fly

This year I pray for you  
Seasons turn, I've got a lot to learn  
And I thank God for you  
  
This year I'm gonna take you home  
This year I don't want to be alone  
This year, this Christmas, together,  
And the minutes they pass, and the hours they fly  
This year, this Christmas, forever

How to forget, and how to forgive without fear

When I try to describe  
How I feel when you hold me  
I get butterflies  
I hear lullabies  
It's hard to explain  
  
Like the scent of a rose  
Or the sound of the rain  
Is too precious and too wonderful  
To give it a name  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
It's on the tip of my tongue  
But my lips are still sealed  
Only violins  
And then innocence  
Can show you how I feel  
  
And I hear them again  
At the end of the day  
I'm all teary eyed  
When we kissed goodbye  
There's nothing I can say  
  
Too beautiful for words  
A symphony inside me  
Too beautiful for words, oh  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Must be a million times  
I tried to express this love of mine  
When it goes this deep  
When it tastes this sweet  
It's not easy to define, ohh  
  
Too beautiful for words (too beautiful)  
A symphony inside me (a symphony inside of me)  
Too beautiful for words (for words)  
I can not take them lightly  
  
Too beautiful for words (too beautiful ohh)  
A symphony inside me (a symphony, oh)  
Too beautiful for words (ohh, too beautiful baby)  
I can not take them lightly  
Can you hear my silent heart  
  
Ohh yeah, yeah, oooh...

I remember when it all first began  
We were tight right from the start  
It wasn't long before you came on strong  
Trying hard to win my heart (trying to win it)  
  
I played hard to get but I couldn't help  
I gave up my ironing  
You were thoughtful  
Careful not to hurt the relationship  
  
What happened to those days when  
You used to be compassionate  
Caring what I thought and said  
So attentive gentleman  
Now it's hard to turn your head away from the TV set  
Taking me for granted lately  
Frankly, it's gotta quit  
  
I feel under appreciated  
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about I say  
I'm feeling underappreciated  
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment  
  
Back to the beginning, to the very beginning  
When our love was something new  
Back when romance was important  
Not just another thing to do  
  
I was feeling high on love tonight  
Thought I never come back down  
Now it seems that you and me  
Have lost our solid ground  
  
Half the time I realize  
I seem to give more than I get  
Funny how things seem to change  
After a few years commitment  
  
Used to talk for hours on end  
'Bout our dreams while we lay in bed  
How I missed those days when you stayed awake  
Now you roll over and snore instead  
  
I feel under appreciated  
Now girls help me out  
'Cause you know what I'm talking about, I say  
I'm feeling under appreciated  
For all the time and effort I have put in this commitment  
  
Oh yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
I miss those nice massages  
The long for closeness  
The way you talk  
How it turned me on  
The thoughtfulness and the sweetest lips  
  
I needed those days back  
  
I feel under appreciated  
Now girls help me out

Mirror mirror on the wall  
Who's the fliest of them all?  
It's me, bow down, get on your knees  
  
Where's my queens?  
Who ain't supreme?  
Let me hear you scream  
Whoa, oh  
  
And they make you see lips on  
Going strong  
Let us not forget  
Who owns the throne?  
(You do mommy)

All the ways that you think you know me  
All the limits that you figured out, limits that you figured out  
Had to learn to keep it all below me  
Just to keep from being thrown around, just to keep from being thrown around  
  
Yeah every single time the wind blows  
Every single time the wind blows  
I see it in your face (Mmm)  
  
In a cold night  
There will be no fair fight  
There will be no good night  
To turn and walk away  
  
To burn me with fire,  
Drown me with rain  
I'm gonna wake up  
Screaming your name  
  
Yes I'm a sinner  
Yes I'm a saint  
Whatever happens here  
Whatever happens here  
We remain  
  
Now we talk about a wasted future  
But we take a good look around  
Yeah we take a good look around  
  
Yeah we know it, it hasn't been for nothing  
'Cause we'll never let it slow us down  
No we'll never let it slow us down  
(Oh yeah)  
  
Yeah every single time the wind blows  
Every single time the wind blows  
I see it in your face (Mmm)  
  
In a cold night  
There will be no fair fight  
There will be no good night  
To turn and walk away  
  
So burn me with fire,  
Drown me with rain  
I'm gonna wake up  
Screaming your name  
  
Yes I'm a sinner  
Yes I'm a saint  
Whatever happens here  
Whatever happens here  
We remain  
  
Said we remain, we remain  
  
Burn me with fire  
Drown me with rain  
I'm gonna wake up  
Screaming your name  
  
Yes I'm a sinner  
Yes I'm a saint  
Whatever happens here  
Whatever happens here  
We remain

Here we are  
Safe at last  
We can breathe a sigh  
Seems the storm has passed  
  
Through it all  
No one knew  
That all the tears in heaven  
Would bring me back to you  
  
No one I know  
Imagined we would make it  
But it only made us glad we both believed  
  
You and me, we're a miracle  
  
Meant to be and nothing can change it  
Mountains move and oceans part  
when they are standing in our way  
You and me, we're a miracle  
Angels stand watching over us  
And heaven shines upon us everyday  
  
Everytime I felt near defeat  
You were there for me  
On my side completely  
You give me strength  
You set me free  
This is because of you  
I'm all that I can be  
  
When I'm with you  
The world is ours to reach for  
Together there is nothing we can't do  
  
You and me, we're a miracle  
  
Meant to be and nothing can change it  
Mountains move and oceans part  
when they are standing in our way  
You and me, we're a miracle  
Angels stand watching over us  
And heaven shines upon us everyday  
  
The chance was so unlikely  
That we would ever be  
Two stars above the heavens  
Destiny brought you to me  
  
You and me, we're a miracle  
You and me, we're a miracle  
Miracle

What child is this who laid to rest  
On Mary's lap is sleeping  
Whom angels greet with anthem sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping  
  
This is Christ the Lord  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
  
Why lies he in such mean estate  
Where ox and ass are feeding  
Good Christian fear, for sinners here  
The silent Word is pleading  
  
This is Christ the Lord  
Whom shepards guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
  
So bring Him incense, gold, and myrh  
Come peasant king to own Him  
The King of Kings, salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
  
This is Christ the Lord  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary

You broke my heart  
That's for sure  
But you don't even know why.  
Don't know what to do  
Now I'm not with you  
But I guess I'll have to try.  
You're everything I'm looking for  
You're a dream that came true.  
Don't know why but now I love you more  
Must be the reason I feel blue.  
So this is why, I'm looking for a guy like you.  
  
I'm looking for a guy who will always be there.  
Not just any guy  
But a guy who could also be my best friend.  
I'm looking for an answer  
Why did you play with my mind?  
But I know for sure, better than you I'll never find.  
No no, I won't find anyone better than you boy.  
That's for sure.  
  
I really thought  
That you and me  
Were more than just friends.  
Then I saw you there  
With that other girl  
So my dream had come to an end.  
You're everything a girl would want  
But you're a mistery to me.  
I'm just so happy that it's you I've found  
You and me, it's ment to be.  
So this is why, baby you're so perfect for me.

Ain't no ocean too deep.  
To make you see...  
That you're so perfect for me.

Now I've figuered it out  
Now I know for sure...  
You're that guy I'm looking for.

I don't know about the travel of time  
And I've never seen most of the world  
I don't know diving out of the sky  
Or living like diamonds and pearls  
  
See I haven't danced to a musical tune  
And I haven't noticed the flowers in bloom  
I haven't smiled when alone in my room very much  
Then we touched  
  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel ready and I lose my self control  
  
I don't know if a doll can unwind  
Or how to make a person go  
I don't know how to be what you like  
And simply open up the depths of my soul  
  
So I keep my wings and my eyes on the down  
Ready for nothing but holding my ground  
I haven't used a particular noun very much  
Then we touched  
  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel sexy and my body turns to gold  
I just know when you put your hands on me  
I feel ready and I lose my self control  
  
I won't notice or pay you no mind  
Boy I couldn't care less what you do with you time  
Your fingertips on my hips  
Just move me like one of a kind

May I have your attention please?  
May I have your attention please?  
Will the Real Slim Shady please shut up?  
I repeat, will the real slim shady please shut up?  
We're gonna have a problem here.  
  
You all act like you never heard a white person before.  
His rhymes are a bore, punk kid trying to be hard core (Yo! What's up??)  
The mushroom mouth is back worse than before.(???)  
Making us snore, whining in the microphone (Baby crying)  
  
It's the return of the oh wait, no wait, you're a fool.  
You didn't pay money for this CD did you?  
And Dr. Dre (laugh) did everything you idiot, without Dre's defense you're as
good as dead.  
  
The world's had enough of Eminem (Jiggy jiggy)  
Even his girlfriend's cheatin on him.  
Look at him, walking around living off Dre, acting so cool, but he's really
kinda weak though.  
  
Little twit blasts me on his new CD  
Why? Cause I turned him down for a date (hee hee)  
As for the question of who came first, was it Carson Daly or was it Fred
Durst?  
I'm sorry Slim, but this is gonna hurt. They both came closer than you ever
will, jerk.  
  
Your song is on my nerves, your song is on my nerves.  
You're kinda lucky cause you got more fame than you deserve.  
That is the message that I deliver to little kids  
You can become famous and never know what talent is.  
  
Of course they're gonna like you, of course they do.  
You're like a cartoon version of Ricky Schroder on "Silver Spoons"  
You ain't nothin' but a product, packaged to be bought up.  
You know a year from now you won't be thought of.  
  
So you write about dead animals and cannibals  
And some day you'll stop dating dogs and date higher mammals. (Dog howls)  
And there's a million women just like me, that think like me, that all can see
that  
Slim Shady is just a boy dealing with puberty  
So if you agree, scream loudly with me!!  
  
You're Slim Shady, yes you're the real shady  
You sound like Peter Brady, you get quite irritating.  
So won't the Real Slim Shady please shut up, please shut up, please shut up?  
  
You're Slim Shady, yes you're the real shady.  
You sound like Peter Brady, you get quite irritating,  
So won't the real slim shady please shut up, please shut up, please shut up
