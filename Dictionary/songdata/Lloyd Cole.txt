She drove her mother's car, 'twas a 2cv  
I was most impressed by her casual dress  
I was most impressed  
Inside her rented room colored deepest blue  
I suppose we found some kind of happiness  
To fill the emptiness  
We were simply wasting precious time  
Hiding from the cruelest summer sky  
She took her mother's car to get away from me  
Heaven knows that i, I can sympathize  
Oh I can sympathize  
For we were never close if the truth were told  
All we ever shared was a taste in clothes  
Oh we were never close  
We were simply losing everything  
Underneath the cruelest london sun  
We were simply wasting precious time  
We were simply wasting precious time  
We were simply wasting precious time

Does it hurt to be polite  
Or is it just cool to be unkind  
Must you always hurt the ones you love  
And then get paid back in time  
Now, now, now  
Andy is fine but his taste is not mine  
Let me tell you I don't mean maybe  
I'm getting really tired of andy's babies  
Some say that children should be seen and not heard  
That's what i'd preferred  
Let's go downtown for a wine  
I'm sure you'll be forced to smile  
When you see andy's babies  
And the bohemian lifestyle  
Now, now now  
Andy's a saint  
But i'm loosing my patience  
I really don't mean maybe  
Don't even wanna talk about andy's babies  
So andy says his children will inherit the earth  
Isn't that absurd, in a word  
Trudy's in the bathroom  
She's trying to clean up her eyes  
And donald's gone to mass  
Yes we are thankful for that  
It's eight in the morning  
And still you can't get no sleep  
On account of this perfect day and  
All this white light white heat  
Ah, isn't that sweet

She's calling up her old boyfriends  
I'm falling in love with her again  
She's looking for a change of pace,she says  
I can see that old look on her face  
She says it takes an open mind  
I think she means an open relationship  
She says I can be so unkind  
All I said was...  
Don't think twice  
If you gotta go, Mary it's alright  
How much love can one man need?  
Don't change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But I'll find another...lover...  
She says it isn't wrong or right  
And me, I'm emotionally colourblind  
She's waking me at half past four  
I'm sleeping on the bathroom floor again  
She's fallen for his new age verse  
I'm holding back a level of consciousness  
I know it isn't wrong or right  
But all I said was...  
Don't think twice  
If you gotta go, Mary it's alright  
How much love can one man need?  
Don't change your mind  
Because true love is hard to find  
But I'll find another...lover...  
I ran into an old girlfriend  
On the corner of Varrick and VanDam  
She said she had to change her address  
What a strange coincidence...  
  

Looking like a born again  
Living like a heretic  
Listening to arthur lee records  
Making all your friends feel so guilty  
About their cynicism  
And the rest of their generation  
Not even the government are gonna stop you now  
But are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
  
Pumped up full of vitamins  
On account of all the seriousness  
You say you're so happy now  
You can hardly stand  
Lean over on the bookcase  
If you really want to get straight  
Read norman mailer  
Or get a new tailor  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to bleed?  
  
What would it take  
What would it take to wipe that smile off of your face?  
Are you ready to be, are you ready to bleed?  
  
Are you ready to be heartbroken?  
Are you ready to bleed? (heartbroken)  
Well you better get ready now baby  
Are you ready to bleed? , ready to bleed?

High tide  
In the cool of the mist  
Walking in the shadows of the trade ships  
I'll be your baby  
I will not be your man  
I will not be around when you call  
Oh Daddy  
I'll be Daddy's little girl  
Black water  
The warm summer rain  
Washes your tears in to the big snake  
Into the ocean  
And your skin is so white under harbour light  
Should you fall I'll be your baby  
Say I'll be daddy's little girl  
Oh Daddy  
I'm all alone now  
Hush little baby  
Don't you cry  
I will sing you a lullaby  
It's high tide  
In the still of your room  
And the big snake's a crawling  
Through the smoke and perfume  
To be your baby  
I will not be your man  
I will be around when you fall  
I'll be your baby  
I'll be Daddy's little girl  
Say it be my Daddy  
I'll be Daddy's little girl  
Oh Daddy  
We're all alone now  
Won't you be my Daddy  
We're all alone now...

Blaming Mary Jane I'm drinking cheap  
She's getting prettier by the ....  
She says I should care more for  
The rich and the poor but I  
Can't find the energy blame Mary Jane  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
Speak plain Mary Jane  
Could you give your hand to a man that  
Never gave a damn  
That's why I rather sleep than thinking  
Nothing more than drinking  
All I want is to blame Mary Jane  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul to the long lonesome  
Afternoons, yes I am  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul to the lonesome afternoon  
Oh maybe I won't be your whipping boy  
I won't be your whipping boy  
Shame baby shame oh shame sweet Mary Jane  
I truly do love you  
She said that I should care more  
For that body of yours  
If you carry the weight of the world oh my  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the long lonesome afternoon  
Yes I am  
I'm gonna close my eyes to the morning papers  
Shut my ear to the news  
I'm gonna lose my soul in the lonesome afternoon  
Maybe I will be your whipping boy  
Maybe I will

Walking in the pouring rain  
Walking with Jesus and Jane  
Jane was in her turtleneck  
I was much happier then  
  
If I were to ask you  
What would you do with yourself?  
If I were to tell you  
Would you just talk to yourself?  
  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
I'm not asking to be understood  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
I'm just looking for a brand new friend  
A brand new friend  
  
Walking in the pouring rain  
Walking with Jesus and Jane  
Jane was in her turtleneck  
I was much happier then  
  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
You could do anything you wanted to  
Am I asking oh for so much?  
No, just something that I can hold down  
'Cause it's all downhill now  
  
So let me count the times that we swore and lied that we'd  
Tie ourself to the railway line  
Let me count the times when of course we lied  
Well we knew no better, it was no crime  
Let me count the times  
  
I, well I don't know when I, when I'll be content  
But I do know I need a brand new friend

You were an innocent child before I laid my hands on you  
And all that pain that you held inside  
Was just waiting to bloom in a darkened room  
And you just flew right into the light and came alive  
My little butterfly  
  
Well you'd never known love and you'd never known pain  
But you found out that they were just like wine and champagne  
You could drink a little more, then you hurt a little less  
And you get that butterfly feeling underneath your dress  
And your promises will turn into lies  
Then you will fly  
My little butterfly  
  
Now I'm lying here babe on your side of the bed  
And I've got unclean thoughts flying through my head  
And I'm thinking about love, yes I'm thinking about pain  
And I'm thinking about some way that I might feel good again  
Yes I'm thinking about my little butterfly

You've been talking in circles now for years man  
Lesson number one is change your attitude  
People would like to help you  
  
All you ever wanted was a picture with the queen  
Ah, welcome to london  
When you've arrived, well you stay or you leave  
Don't you know you're quite certain  
Nothing is so pretty as it used to be, no indeed  
  
Could you entertain us with a song  
With a very special melody  
We could sing along  
And you know you should be grateful  
But I let it pass  
'Cause you can't get arrested  
But you could kiss my ass  
In hollywood, yeah yeah, doo doo doo  
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah

In hollywood, doo doo, doo doo

I was looking for a rhyme for the new york times  
When I sensed I was not alone  
She said d'you know how to spell audaciously  
I could tell I was in luck  
And so I forced a smile contrary to my style  
And she looked into my eyes  
She said d'you want to go heaven  
Or would you rather not be saved  
Here comes my train  
I'm on my way, will you not see  
I don't need your sympathy  
I won't read your poetry, oh sweetness please  
So she took me back to her basement flat  
Which was down on charlotte street  
Though it was never my intention  
We were not intense, not least because  
Well if you must just take then I'm a piece of cake  
That is what she said to me  
And so I gave myself to her charity  
Well at least that's how it seemed  
Here comes my train  
I'm on my way, what got into me  
I don't need your sympathy  
I won't read your poetry, oh bittersweets  
I was looking for a rhyme for the new times when I was distracted  
Yes those were precious times together that we wasted  
Now I'm working hard for my union card  
I must believe in charlotte street  
Though it was never my intention to stay so long  
So long

I remember you well in the chelsea hotel,  
You were talking so brave and so sweet,  
Giving me head on the unmade bed,  
While the limousines wait in the street.  
Those were the reasons and that was new york,  
We were running for the money and the flesh.  
And that was called love for the workers in song  
Probably still is for those of them left.  
Ah but you got away, didn't you babe,  
You just turned your back on the crowd,  
You got away, I never once heard you say,  
I need you, I don't need you,  
I need you, I don't need you  
And all of that jiving around.  
I remember you well in the chelsea hotel  
You were famous, your heart was a legend.  
You told me again you preferred handsome men  
But for me you would make an exception.  
And clenching your fist for the ones like us  
Who are oppressed by the figures of beauty,  
You fixed yourself, you said, "well never mind,  
We are ugly but we have the music."  
And then you got away, didn't you babe...  
I don't mean to suggest that I loved you the best,  
I can't keep track of each fallen robin.  
I remember you well in the chelsea hotel,  
That's all, I don't even think of you that often.  

When you're nothing to no one  
And you're less than you can  
And you're looking for someone  
Who won't cling to anything  
So you're stuck in some motel  
With the sound of her sleeping  
Don't you feel kinda old now  
Well ain't that a funny thing  
I used to wake up early  
I used to try to believe  
But life seems neverending  
When you're young  
So you're back on the highway  
And there's wind in her hair  
And you know that it's no time for thinking  
About somebody up there  
'Cause you'll turn her to drinking  
And you'll lead her to hell  
With her bottle beside her  
She surely looks like an angel  
I used to wake up early  
I used to try to believe  
But faith is never easy  
When you're young  
No no no  
I used to wake up early  
Now it's hard, hard enough to sleep  
But life seems neverending  
When you're young  
Oh no no no no

some say that you may soon be leaving town  
do you tire of chasing all the women around  
will you never be contented with your life  
will you always be the one who won't think twice  
when you go down on your knees  
you're so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
you're so hard , down on mission street  
god only knows how you can hurt her  
when you know that's what you do  
how does it feel to be so cruel  
will you never be contented with your life  
will you always be the one who won't look back  
when you go down on your knees  
you're so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
it feels like up, down on mission street  
julie said your eyes are blue  
your lips are cold as stone  
she picked you up and you put her down  
and messed her place around  
will you never be contented with your life  
will you always be the one who won't think twice  
when you go down on your knees  
you're so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
you're so hard , down on mission street  
when you go down on your knees  
you're so hard to please  
when you go down on your knees  
it feels like up, down on mission street  

I want to take you down to the side of the city  
Where the sun doesn't shine and the moon isn't pretty  
The slow train crawls in the nights and the days  
Are as warm as the smoke and the heat haze  
Yes and neon here twenty-four hours of the day  
And you're sure looking pretty when it's hitting on your face  
Looker on the corner take that dog for a donor  
Well she's only doing what her mother told her  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I want to see a touch of evil in your eye  
But all that I'm getting babe is sweetness and lies  
I want to see something that I might desire  
I want to take you down babe into the mire  
Deals going down no chance no masking  
One thing's for sure never get what you're asking  
They're coming with johnsons, they're coming with knives  
They're robbing your boots when they give you a shoe shine  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right downtown  
Slow train down, babe, try twenty-nine  
There's no looking back when there's no sense of time  
'Cause it's neon here twenty-four hours of the day  
And you're sure looking pretty when it's hitting on your face  
With a touch of evil in your eye  
With a touch of evil in your eye  
I want to take you down to the side of the city  
I want to take you down to the blur of the city  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
I want to take you right down  
I... I want to take you down  
I want to take you down  
Yes I want to take you right down  
I... I... I... I want to take you  
I... I... I... I want to take you  
I... Yes I want to take you right downtown

Don't hesitate, there is no time like now  
For you to break the habits of a lifetime  
Babe, get on your pony and ride  
Make no mistake, we're gonna cry at your funeral  
T-bone steak, french fries for heaven's sake,  
Your belly's bigger than your eyes  
All you could eat for a dollar and a dream  
And the drinks are on the house at the funeral parlor  
If you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
(wake up, time to fly)  
Sugar kiss, sugar kicks like a mule  
Ain't that the truth, and you're a strawberry fool  
Look at your hips, look at the cream in your coffee  
You could whip it, or we could cry at your funeral  
If you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
Well if you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey hey hey  
Well if you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
If you don't know what's good for you boy  
Eat your fried greens and pray  
Nobody loves you more than we do  
Sha la la la la la hey  
If you don't know  
If you don't know  
What's good  
If you don't know  

From northerton to northern california  
Folk don't really change  
And there's always the rain  
From southport beach to Sunday in the hamptons  
Well I never could complain  
And there's always the rain  
The fool you are in manchester  
The fool you are in maine  
The lies you tell in liverpool  
Will follow you to spain  
It's the fool you are  
From lambeth walk to london, ontario  
We'd like(love) to run away  
When it looks like rain  
From sunset strip to waterloo underground  
The stars are just the same  
And it looks like rain  
The fool you are in manchester  
The fool you are in maine  
The lies you tell in liverpool  
Will follow you to spain  
It's the fool you are  
It's the fool you are  
Yes it is  
From the sunshine state to shaftesbury avenue  
Folk don't really change  
And there's always the rain  
And the night before in northern california  
Is dawning on the thames and it looks like rain  
The fool you are in manchester  
The fool you are in maine  
The lies you tell in liverpool  
Will follow you to spain  
And the morning after leicester square  
Is hungover in rome  
And never again in newcastle  
Is one more for the road  
It's the fool you are  
It's the fool you are  
Yes it is  
It's the fool you are  
It's the fool that's what you are  
It's the fool you are  

Heaven is a shadow of your live  
I'm a lonesome alcoholic for your kiss  
Should I sit around  
And wait  
Well I had a chance  
I hesitate  
To ask you for the pleasure of your company  
What would you say  
Would you think about it  
Would you think about it  
Right now  
  
I've been put upon  
I've been passed round  
For ever and I'm waiting for  
The thirteenth of never  
Should I swear to be true  
Should you give a damn  
What I say or do  
Well, I'm asking for the pleasure of your company  
What would you say  
Would you think about it  
Would you think about it  
Right now  
  
Love a cheat  
I've got everything you need  
And I'm asking for the pleasure of your company  
What do you say  
Baby oh  
Cause it's been a long time  
Baby  
Think about it

She crossed herself as she put on her things  
She has promised once before not to live this way  
If she don't calm down she will burn herself out  
Like a forest fire, well doesn't that make you smile  
  
If you don't slow down, I swear that I'll come round  
And mess up your place, let's go for a spin  
They say we shouldn't even know each other  
And that we'll be undone  
Don't it make you smile like a forest fire  
  
I believe in love, I'll believe in anything  
That's gonna get me what I want and get me off my knees  
Then we'll burn your house down, don't it feel so good  
There's a forest fire every time we get together  
  
Hey pick you up, put you down  
Rip you up and spin you round  
Just like we said we would  
'Cause we're a forest fire  
Believe you me, we'll tear this place down  
  
If we get caught in this wind, then we could burn the ocean  
If we get caught in this scene, we're gonna be undone  
It's just a simple metaphor  
It's for a burning love  
Don't it make you smile like a forest fire

I was woken up at four a.m. by your screams and anguished cries  
Your mother was singing in the bathroom, she will never be my child  
Oh baby talks in her sleep so loud  
We're living four flights up but I swear right now it feels like underground  
  
Well you have absolutely no common sense, yes I know that's your charm  
You spend the whole day on the phone, you say well it helps you stay calm  
You cling to my arm, yes I know that's your charm  
And when I ask you what you want you say a diamante crocodile  
  
Well then could you give me some peace, you say well maybe for a while  
Sometimes you know you could almost be a child  
Oh must you tell me all your secrets  
When it's hard enough to love you knowing nothing  
  
We're living four flights up but I swear right now it feels like underground  
You are your own worst enemy, so don't expect my sympathy  
Oh go back to your mother's house and cry your little heart out  
You can drive them back to town in a beat-up grace kelly car  
  
Looking like a friend of truman capote, looking exactly like you are  
Yes, yes I know that's your charm  
So don't ask me if I want you, only ask me if I must  
I been blown around so long, don't know which senses to trust  
  
Oh no, but I know that I must  
Oh must you tell me all your secrets  
When it's hard enough to love you knowing nothing  
We're living four flights up but I swear right now it feels like underground

This one's from the hip  
Oh mother you have sorely misjudged me  
It should have been whipped  
Out of me  
Without a father figured I  
Yeah I concluded then that I'm  
Not for spitting on  
This one's from the hip  
My love I should have warned you about me  
It never got whipped  
Out of me  
Me and my modesty and  
Mother your wretched son won't  
Take his medicine  
Not I  
I don't care anymore  
I'm sick and I'm tired  
And I don't care anymore  
This one's from the hip  
Why should I know why?  
It's a wicked world  
I've had it up to here  
Sweet jesus I should have warned you about me  
It's sure to end in tears  
And misery  
Without a father figured I  
Yeh I concluded then that I'm  
Not for spitting on  
Not I...  
Why should I know why should I care?  
Who's telling me what I should wear?  
Mother your wretched son is hooked on his medicine  
I don't care anymore  
I'm sick and I'm tired  
And I don't care anymore  
This one's from the hip  
Why should I know why  
It's a wicked world

Once you were an angel  
Jesse honey is it hard to take  
Does it feel so bad to be 28 you were 23  
And you could do anything now you open your mouth  
And spit the gutter out  
I was walking down by the river thames  
I decided that I should throw me in  
Because you broke my heart and you made me weep  
In the name of your sensitivity  
Still once you were an angel  
Did nobody tell you jesse honey oh you look so pale  
And old and so very I'll at ease these days  
So you tell yourself that you'll never win  
And you drown your sins in amphetamine  
Do you weary so of that bitter taste  
So you spit in my face just to keep you entertained  
Still I can only love you I have no option but to  
Is hard to take is it is it hard to swallow  
Is it is it hard to take from grace  
Once you were an angel  
Did nobody tell you jesse honey is it hard to take  
Does it feel so bad to be 28 you were 23  
And you could do anything  
Now you open your mouth and you spit the gutter out  
Out in the summer rain  
You will begin again  
Out in the summer rain  
We will begin again

You walk in my house with her lipstick over your face  
You tell me you got news for me  
Well, do you think I can't see straight?  
Do you think I can't recognize her perfume on your clothes  
You tell me you got news for me  
Well, I don't need to be told  
Let me guess, she's looking for a little peace of mind  
I don't want to cause any more pain  
But could I please have what's mine?  
She's got such a pretty please  
I never could say no  
Well just take her half of everything, and then please go  
Now I know right now you're thinking  
I'm some crazy kind of fool  
But the truth of the matter is I'm just like you  
She's some kind of voodoo woman  
She said she can't use me anymore  
That's what she said to me  
She said, I can't use you anymore  
I don't need your lovin'  
I don't need your kissin'  
I don't need for you to tell me  
All that I've been missin'  
I don't need your lovin'  
I don't need your kissin'  
I don't need for you to tear me down  
And tear me down again  
Every time you give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
Every time you give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
And when you can't give a little more  
She could still use a little more  
She could still use a little more  
She could still use a little more  
Tell her that she done me  
That she done me good  
Tell her that she done me  
Like a lady should  
I never ever seen her, and I hope I never do  
I might have to show her just what love can do  
The sun ain't gonna shine, and the rain is gonna fall  
'Cause I put a spell on you  
And all the years I cried  
All the years that I tried  
To save a stillborn love  
I know what you're thinking  
Pretty soon, I'll howl at the moon  
But you better believe me  
'Cause I was just like you  
Mister, read the writing on the wall  
Get out while you're still whole  
While you're still breathing  
I don't need your lovin'  
(I don't need your lovin')  
Kissin'  
(I don't need your kissin')  
Lovin', no I don't need  
Tear me down again  
(I don't need your lovin')  
Mmm, lovin'  
(I don't need your kissin')  
Mmm, kissin', and I don't need  
Tear me down again  
(I don't need your lovin')  
Yeah  
(I don't need your kissin')  
No, I don't need her to tear me down again

There you go again  
Alma tell me when  
Will you never learn  
And now you're underweight  
And overpaid  
You will not be saved  
And you're pushing 38  
Heaven knows your train is late  
Although my chance is slim  
You percieve the state you're in  
Is good for one last fling  
In a drastic dress you walk in drastic steps  
Revealing no interest  
You know it seems you wont be spared  
And you're so much wiser unaware, unaware  
Independent means being alone and being  
Good for one last fling  
So there you go again  
Alma tell me when  
Will you ever learn  
Instead you walk in these drastic steps  
When you know too well  
You're train has left, you're train has left

Hey Rusty  
It's a long time  
Remember  
It's like yesterday  
Stealing cigarettes  
And laughing as they chased us  
Down the boulevards  
Then I got a job  
White collar  
Turn coat  
You just spun around and walked  
Said we wouldn't meet again  
Hey Rusty don't hang up  
I feel so young  
Hey Rusty don't hang up  
'Cause we're still young  
I just need one friend  
She said hey  
Don't take it so bad  
She said hey  
It wasn't so much  
We just ran out of gas  
Or something like that  
That's when I  
I crashed my car  
Not by chance  
And not out of love  
Then I walked out of that job  
You should've seen their faces  
Hey Rusty don't hang up  
I just need one friend  
And we're not finished yet  
No way  
Hey Rusty  
I changed my mind  
What d'you say we start again  
No I mean it this time  
Stealing cigarettes  
And laughing as they chase us  
Down the boulevards

Never doubting  
Always faithful  
She returns  
She says she loves me  
And I could always  
Come to her  
She can't imagine how  
Another lover  
Could turn her head  
And I'm so grateful  
That I'm still willing  
To have her home  
She says she loves me  
She won't forget me  
And then she's gone  
She thinks that later  
We can pick up the pieces  
And carry on  
And I'd forgive her  
Still not suspecting  
She could be wrong  
Now I'm so grateful  
I'm no longer willing  
To have her home  
Now I'm so grateful  
I'm no longer willing  
To have her home
