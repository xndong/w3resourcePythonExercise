Please lock me away  
And don't allow the day  
Here inside where I hide  
With my loneliness  
  
I don't care what they say I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
Birds sing out of tune  
And rain clouds hide the moon  
I'm OK, here I'll stay  
With my loneliness  
  
I don't care what they say I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
So I wait and in a while  
I will see my true love's smile  
She may come, I know not when  
When she does I lose  
So baby until then  
  
Lock me away  
And don't allow the day  
Here inside where I hide  
With my loneliness  
  
I don't care what they say I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
So I wait and in a while  
I will see my true love's smile  
She may come, I know not when  
When she does I lose  
So baby until then  
  
Lock me away  
And don't allow the day  
Here inside where I hide  
With my loneliness  
  
I don't care what they say I won't stay  
In a world without love  
  
I don't care what they say I won't stay  
In a world without love

Gather 'round me, everybody  
Gather 'round me, while I preach some  
Feel a sermon coming on here  
The topic will be sin  
And that's what I'm agin'  
If you wanna hear my story  
Then settle back and just sit tight  
While I start reviewing  
The attitude of doing right  
  
You got to ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive  
E-lim-i-nate the negative  
And latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with mister in between  
  
You got to spread joy up to the maximum  
Bring gloom down to the minimum  
And have faith, or pandemonium  
Liable to walk upon the scene  
  
To illustrate my last remark  
Jonah in the whale, Noah in the ark,  
What did they do, just when everything looked so dark?  
Man, they said, we better  
  
Ac-cent-tchu-ate the positive  
E-lim-i-nate the negative  
And latch on to the affirmative  
Don't mess with mister in between

Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Only darkness every day  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And this house just ain't no home  
Any time she goes away  
  
I wonder this time where she's gone (Ooh ooh)  
Is she really goin' to stay (Oh yeh, yeh, yeh, yeh)  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
She's always gone too long  
Any time she goes away (Oh yeh, yeh)  
  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know  
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know, I know  
That I can't leave no thing alone  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone (woo-ooh)  
  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
Is she really goin' to stay  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone  
And she's always gone too long  
Anytime she goes away, anytime she goes away  
Anytime she goes away, anytime she goes away  
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone

You made me cry when you said goodbye  
Ain't that a shame?  
My tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame  
  
Oh well, goodbye, although I'm crying  
Ain't that a shame?  
My tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame  
You know you're the one to blame  
Baby  
  
Well, you broke my heart when you said we're gonna part  
But ain't that a shame?  
Oh my tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame, yeah  
  
Oh well, goodbye, although I'm crying  
Ain't that a shame?  
Oh, my tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame  
Ain't that a shame  
  
Oh well, good goodbye although I'm gonna cry  
Ain't that a shame?  
Oh my tears fell like rain  
Ain't that a shame? You're the one to blame

There's only one thing that money can't buy  
True love, that will never die, oh no, no  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
  
If religion was a thing that money could buy  
Well the rich would live and the poor would die  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
  
Well, the river of Jordan is chilly and cold, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Chills the body but not the soul, yeah  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over  
All my trials, Lord, soon be over

A well I bless my soul  
What's wrong with me?  
I'm itching like a man on a fuzzy tree  
My friends say I'm acting wild as a bug  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
  
My hands are shaky and my knees are weak  
I can't seem to stand on my own two feet  
Who do you thank when you have such luck?  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
  
Please don't ask me what's on my mind  
I'm a little mixed up, but I'm feeling fine  
When I'm near that girl that I love best  
My heart beats so it scares me to death  
  
She touched my hand what a chill I got  
Her lips are like a volcano that's hot  
I'm proud to say she's my buttercup  
  
I'm in love  
I'm all shook up  
Mm mm oh, oh, yeah, yeah!  
  
My tongue get tied when I try to speak  
My insides shake like a leaf on a tree  
There's only one cure for this body of mine  
That's to have the girl that I love so fine

I want someone to come home to  
I need somewhere I can sleep  
I need a place where I can rest my weary bones  
and have a conversation not too deep  
  
Everybody else is busy doing better than me  
But I can see why it is  
They got someone setting them free  
Someone breaking the chains  
Someone let me be  
  
I want someone who can save me  
When I come home with a zoo  
I need somebody who's a sweet communicator  
I can give my alligator to  
  
Everybody (?) a whole day talkin' about  
And I can see why it is  
They got someone breaking them out  
Someone finding the key  
Someone setting them free  
  
Could you be that person for me?  
Would you feel right setting me free?  
Could you dare to find my key?  
  
I want someone I can (?)  
When I come home to my troops  
I need somebody who's to deal it with my sailor (?)  
(?)  
  
Everybody else is busy doing better than me  
And I can see why it is  
They got someone setting them free  
Someone breaking the chains  
Someone letting them be  
  
Could you be that person for me?  
Would you feel right setting me free?  
Could you dare to find my key?

Everything went wrong  
And the whole day long  
I'd feel so blue  
For the longest while  
I forgot to smile  
Then I met you  
Now that my blue days have passed  
Now that I've found you at last  
  
I'll be loving you, always  
With a love that's true, always  
When the things you've planned  
Need a helping hand  
I will understand  
Always, always  
  
Days may not be fair, always  
That's when I'll be there, always  
Not for just an hour  
Not for just a day  
Not for just a year  
But always  
  
Dreams will all come true  
Growing old with you  
And time will fly  
Caring each day more  
Than the day before  
Till spring rolls by  
Then when the springtime has gone  
Then will my love linger on

I give her all my love  
That's all I do  
And if you saw my love  
You'd love her too  
I love her  
  
She gives me everything  
And tenderly  
The kiss my lover brings  
She brings to me  
And I love her  
  
A love like ours  
Could never die  
As long as I  
Have you near me  
  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her  
  
Bright are the stars that shine  
Dark is the sky  
I know this love of mine  
Will never die  
And I love her

What The Hell Gives The Right To Tell Me What To Do With My Life?  
Especially When You Made A Mess Of Every Chance You Had To Success.  
Look At You... Just Look At You.  
I Said I'm Angry Just Looking At You.  
  
I'm Sick And Tired Of Sitting Back Listening To All Of Your Clap-Trap  
If You Could Get Me To Take The Rap I Guarantee  
You'd Leave Me With A Backslap.  
Push Me To The Left, Push Me To The Right Try To Take Me Out Of The Way  
Ven If You Kick Me Off The Edge Of The World,  
You're Still Going To Hear Me Say...  
  
When The Hell Gives You The Right To Tell Me What To Do With My Life?  
Especially When You Made A Mess Of Every Chance You Have To Success.  
Look At You. Oh Look At You.  
I Said I'm Angry Just Looking At You.  
  
Shouting Down Again Mahama. Shouting Down Again.  
Shouting Down Agaun Mahama. Shouting Down Again.  
  
I Can't Begin To Tell You All The Reasons Why You're Making Me Crazy.  
I've Got So Many Answers Like You're Stupid, Like You're Crooked, Like You're
Lazy.  
  
Hit Me With Your Left, Hit Me With Your Right.  
Hit Me From The Top To The Toe.  
Even When You Chew Me Up And Spit Me Out,  
I'm Still Going To Want To Know.  
  
Lyrics By Mickjagger43

Every day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair,  
Wraps a towel around her  
As she's heading for the bedroom chair,  
Its just another day.  
Slipping into stockings,  
Stepping into shoes,  
Dipping in the pocket of her raincoat.  
Ah, it's just another day.  
  
At the office where the papers grow she takes a break,  
Drinks another coffee  
And she finds it hard to stay awake,  
  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day.  
  
Ay  
So sad, so sad,  
Sometimes she feels so sad.  
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell,  
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.  
  
Ah, stay, don't stand around  
And he comes and he stays  
But he leaves the next day,  
So sad.  
Sometimes she feels so sad.  
  
As she posts another letter to the sound of five,  
People gather round her  
And she finds it hard to stay alive,  
  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day.  
  
Ay  
So sad, so sad,  
Sometimes she feels so sad.  
Alone in her apartment she'd dwell,  
Till the man of her dreams comes to break the spell.  
  
Ah, stay, don't stand around  
And he comes and he stays  
But he leaves the next day,  
So sad.  
Sometimes she feels so sad.  
  
Every day she takes a morning bath she wets her hair,  
Wraps a towel around her  
As she's heading for the bedroom chair,  
Its just another day.  
  
Slipping into stockings,  
Stepping into shoes,  
Dipping in the pockets of her raincoat.  
  
Ah, it's just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day. du du du du du  
Its just another day.

If you love me, won't you call me  
I've been waiting, waiting to long  
In my soul is, constant yearning  
Always singing, singing this song  
  
Only love is strong enough, to take it on the chin  
When did I begin, to fall  
  
Anyway, anyway, you can make, that call  
You feel free, to make yourself, at home - woh-oh, ahhhhhh, ohhhhh  
  
If we could be, closer longer  
That would help me, help me so much  
We can cure each other's sorrow  
Won't you please, please, please get in touch  
  
If our love is strong enough, it may never end  
Why would I pretend, to fall, woo-ew  
  
Anyway, anyway, you can make, that call  
You feel free, to make yourself, at home - woh-oh, ahhhhhh  
  
Anyway, anyway, anyway, at all  
Anyway, you can make that call.

Lift up your head  
And remember what your life is  
Don't have to give it all away  
When you're left for dead  
In the middle of a crisis  
You must appreciate the day  
  
There's something there  
But you're frightened to invite it  
Beware of pushing it away  
Show that you care  
And be certain you don't fight it  
You must appreciate the day  
  
She says you don't give back what you take  
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love  
She says it's all a show and no-go  
You drop everything, give back  
Reciprocate her love  
  
Lift up your head  
And remember what your life is  
Don't have to give it all away  
When you're left for dead  
In the middle of a crisis  
You must appreciate the day  
  
She says you don't give back what you take  
She got evidence you don't appreciate her love  
She says it's all a show and no-go  
You drop everything, give back  
Reciprocate her love  
  
There's something there  
But you're frightened to invite it  
Beware of pushing it away  
Show that you care  
And be certain you don't fight it  
You must appreciate the day

Ooh, baby,  
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me,  
If you'd had taken an arrow and runned right through me.  
Uh, uh, uh, uh.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
A bird in the hand is worth two flying,  
But when it came to love I knew you'd be lying.  
  
It could have been a finer fling,  
Would have been a major attraction.  
With no other thing  
Offering a note of distraction.  
Come on, get up, get under way and bring your love.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
You wouldn't have found a more down hero,  
If you'd had started at nothing and counted to zero.  
  
Oo-oo-oo.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
You couldn't have done a worse thing to me,  
If you'd had taken an arrow and runned right through me.  
  
It could have been a finer fling,  
Flying in a righter direction.  
With no other thing  
Featuring but love and affection.  
Come on, get up, get under way and bring your love.  
  
Ooh, baby,  
You wouldn't have found a more down hero,  
If you'd had started at nothing and counted to zero.  
  
Ah... Ooh...

At the mercy, at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy road,  
Who can handle such a heavy load?  
  
At the mercy, At the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy day,  
We can think of nothing more to say  
  
If you show me love, I won't refuse  
I know you'd never make me choose  
Between the love I've got and the love I'd lose  
  
Sometimes I'd rather run and hide,  
Then stay and face the fear inside  
  
At the mercy, at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy day,  
Who can bear to turn their head away?  
  
At the mercy, at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy road  
We can watch the universe explode  
  
If you take me up, I won't say no  
I guess you'd rather see me grow  
Into a better man than the one you know  
  
Sometimes my head is hanging low  
It's time to get on with the show  
  
At the mercy, at the mercy  
At the mercy of a busy day  
I can think of nothing more to say

[Chorus:]  
Look at the average person  
Speak to the man in the street  
Can you imagine the first one you'd meet?  
  
Well, I'm talking to a former engine driver  
Trying to find out what he used to do  
Tells me that he always kept his engine  
Spit and polished up as good as new  
But he said his only great ambition  
Was to work with lions in a zoo  
Oh to work with lions in a zoo  
Yes dear, you heard right  
Told me his ambition was to work with lions every night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well, I met a woman working as a waitress  
I asked exactly what it was she did  
Said she worked the summer crowd at seasides  
Winter time she ran away and hid  
Once she had a Hollywood audition  
But the part was given to a kid  
Yes,the part was given to a kid  
Yes sir, you heard it right  
Hollywood ambition made a starlet grown up overnight  
  
Well I bumped into a man who'd been a boxer  
Asked him what had been his greatest night  
He looked into the corners of his memory  
Searching for a picture of the fight  
But he said he always had a feeling  
That he lacked a little extra height  
(Could have used a little extra height)  
Yes mate, you heard right  
He always had a feeling that he might have lacked a little height  
  
Look at the average person  
Speak to the man in the queue  
Can you imagine the first one is you?  
  
Look at the average person.

When the moon lays his head on a pillow,  
And the stars settle down for a rest,  
Just do me one small favour, I beg you,  
Please, play me my baby's request.  
  
It's the song that we heard when we started,  
Now the birds have all flown from our nest.  
But you could bring back mem'ries, departed,  
By playing my baby's request.  
  
My baby said,  
That she knows how it goes,  
But you're the one who really knows.  
So go ahead,  
Just one more time and then we'll go to bed.  
  
But you could bring back mem'ries, departed,  
By playing my baby's request.  
  
My baby says,  
That she knows how it goes,  
But you're the one who really knows.  
So go ahead,  
Just one more time and then we'll go to bed.  
  
When the moon lays his head on a pillow,  
And the stars settles down for a rest,  
Just do me one small favour, I beg you,  
Please, play me baby's request,  
Mm-mm, play me baby's request,  
Please, play me my baby's request.  
  
One more time.

Flew in from Miami Beach BOAC  
Didn't get to bed last night  
On the way the paper bag was on my knee  
Man I had a dreadful flight  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
You don't know how lucky you are boy  
Back in the U.S.S.R.  
  
Been away so long I hardly knew the place  
Gee it's good to be back home  
Leave it till tomorrow to unpack my case  
Honey disconnect the phone  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
You don't know how lucky you are boy  
Back in the U.S.S.R.  
  
Well the Ukraine girls really knock me out  
They leave the West behind  
And Moscow girls make me sing and shout  
That Georgia's always on my mind.  
  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
You don't know how lucky you are boys  
Back in the U.S.S.R.  
  
Show me round your snow peaked mountains way down south  
Take me to your daddy's farm  
Let me hear your balalaika's ringing out  
Come and keep your comrade warm.  
I'm back in the U.S.S.R.  
You don't know how lucky you are boys  
Back in the U.S.S.R.

Well I used to smile when I was a pup  
Sailing down the Nile in a china cup  
With the recipe for a lovely day  
Sticking out of my back pocket  
  
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight  
We used to fight like cats and dogs  
But we made it up in the ballroom  
  
[Chorus]  
Ballroom dancing made a man of me  
One, two, three, four  
I just plain adore your  
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV  
I got what I got from ballroom dancing  
Big b.d.  
  
Well I used to fly when I was a kid  
And I didn't cry if it hurt a bit  
On a carpet ride to a foreign land  
At the time of Davy Crockett  
  
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight  
We used to fight like cats and dogs  
Till we made it up in the ballroom  
  
Ballroom dancing made a man of me  
One, two, three, four  
I just plain adore your  
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV  
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing  
Big b.d.  
  
Well went so fast and we all grew up  
Now the days that passed in the china cup  
Are the memories of another day  
And I wouldn't want to knock it  
  
But it wasn't always such a pretty sight  
We used to fight like cats and dogs  
But we made it up in the ballroom  
  
Ballroom dancing made a man of me  
One, two, three, four  
I just plain adore your  
Ballroom dancing, seen it on TV  
I got quite a lot from ballroom dancing  
Big b.d.

Stuck inside these four walls,  
Sent inside forever,  
Never seeing no one  
Nice again like you,  
Mama you, mama you.  
  
If I ever get out of here,  
Thought of giving it all away  
To a registered charity.  
All I need is a pint a day  
If I ever get outta here  
If we ever get outta of here  
  
Well, the rain exploded with a mighty crash  
As we fell into the sun,  
And the first one said to the second one there  
I hope you're having fun.  
  
Band on the run, band on the run.  
And the jailer man and sailor Sam  
Were searching every one  
For the band on the run,  
Band on the run  
Band on the run,  
Band on the run.  
  
Well, the undertaker drew a heavy sigh  
Seeing no one else had come,  
And a bell was ringing in the village square  
For the rabbits on the run.  
  
Band on the run,  
Band on the run.  
And the jailer man and sailor Sam  
Were searching every one  
For the band on the run,  
Band on the run  
  
Yeah the band on the run,  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
  
Well, the night was falling as the desert world  
Began to settle down.  
In the town they're searching for us everywhere  
But we never will be found.  
  
Band on the run,  
Band on the run.  
And the county judge who held a grudge  
Will search for evermore  
For the band on the run,  
Band on the run  
Band on the run  
Band on the run

Someone's gone out fishing  
Someone's high and dry.  
Someone's on a mission to the lonely Lorelei.  
Some folk's got a vision of a castle in the sky  
And I'm left stranded, wondering why.  
  
You and me together  
Nothing feels so good  
Even if I get a medal from my local neighborhood  
I won't need a castle, they've got castles in Versailles  
And I'm still stranded, wondering why  
  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
It's a beautiful night for love  
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
It's a beautiful night for love  
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
  
Some boat's on the ocean  
We're here in this room  
Seems to me the perfect way to spend an afternoon  
We can look for castles, pretty castles in the sky  
No more wondering, wondering why  
  
Things can go wrong, things can go right  
Things can go bump, in the dead of the night  
So let me be there, let me be there  
Let me be there with you in the dead of the night  
  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
It's a beautiful night for love  
A wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
Make it a beautiful night for me  
Such a beautiful night for love  
Such a wonderful sight for lovers of love to behold  
  
Yeah, it's a beautiful night  
Yeah, it's a beautiful night  
  
Yeah, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Yeah, it's such a beautiful night, beautiful, beautiful night  
  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night  
Beautiful night, beautiful night, beautiful night

Can't say I've found out  
I can't tell you  
What it's all about  
Don't know who does  
Tell you to  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Oh, oh, oh  
No, no, no  
I must be wrong, baby, yeah  
But I don't believe  
That he's the one  
But you insist  
I must be wrong  
I must be wrong  
I have to leave  
And when I'm gone  
I'll leave my message  
In my song, that's right  
Beware, my love  
Well, he'll bowl you over  
Beware, my love  
Before you're much older  
Hey, he'll sweep you up  
Under his carpet  
You'd be in luck  
If you could stop it  
Come on, now  
Beware, my love  
Let me tell you  
Well, he'll wear you out  
And in a minute

Beware my love  
Beware my love

Beware my love  
Beware my love  
Beware my love

Well, flying across the desert in a TWA  
I saw a woman walking in the sand  
She'd be walking thirty miles en route to Bombay  
To meet a brown-eyed, handsome man  
Her destination was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Way back in history, three thousand years  
In fact, ever since the world began  
There's been a whole lotta good women shedding tears  
Over a brown-eyed, handsome man  
A lot of trouble was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, the Venus de Milo was a beautiful lass  
She had the world in the palm of her hand  
She lost both her arms in a wrestling match  
To win a brown-eyed, handsome man  
She fought, and won herself a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, a beautiful daughter couldn't make up her mind  
Between a doctor and a lawyer man  
Her mother told her daughter  
Go out, and find yourself a brown-eyed, handsome man  
Just like your daddy was, a brown-eyed, handsome man  
  
Well, a two, three the count with nobody home  
He hit a high-flyer into the stand  
A-rounded third, he was a-heading for home  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man that won the game  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man  
It was a brown-eyed, handsome man

Pack up all my cares and woes,  
Here I go, singing low,  
Bye, bye, blackbird.  
Where somebody waits for me,  
Sugar is sweet, so is she,  
Bye, bye, blackbird.  
  
No one here can love and understand me,  
Oh, what hard luck stories they all hand me.  
  
Make my bed and light the light,  
I'll arrive late tonight,  
Blackbird, bye, bye.

For money can't buy me love

A certain softness  
In her eyes  
Fascinates me  
More than I ever thought it would.  
(A certain softness)  
More than I ever thought it could  
  
A certain softness  
In her eyes  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
A kind of sadness  
In her smile  
Captivates me  
Surer than anything that's sure  
(A kind of sadness)  
Surer than anything before  
  
The kind of sadness in a smile  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
If I could even find the words to tell you  
I wouldn't want to anyway  
'Cause that could only break the spell  
And you know very well  
I couldn't betray her  
  
A touch of wildness  
In her style  
Haunts my memory  
More than I ever thought it would  
(A touch of wildness)  
More than I ever thought it could  
  
A touch of wildness in her style  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
Got me hooked  
  
(Repeat first verse)

I know a tiny waterfall  
A magic little place  
Where we can play together  
And watch the fishes race  
Children children where are you  
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain  
I hope you not too far away  
For me to see again  
  
I know where there's a fairy  
Who will invite us all to tea  
But she won't let me in alone  
You'll have to come with me  
  
Children children where are you  
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain  
I hope you not too far away  
For me to see again  
  
I know a tiny waterfall  
A magic little place  
Where we can play together  
And watch the fishes race  
  
Children children where are you  
Hiding in the forest playing in the rain  
I hope you not too far away  
For me to see again

(Paul McCartney)  
There once was a time when I thought if I had a house, I'd be happy  
There once was a time when I thought if I had a car, I'd be made  
One by one I achieved my ambitions  
But didn't feel like I wanted to feel  
Didn't feel like I wanted it to feel  
I didn't feel like I wanted to feel  
I needed a comfort of love  
Any place and anytime  
I needed a comfort of love  
Just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh  
I long for the time when the world is a better place, to be happy  
I long for the day when the people who went to sleep, will awake  
One by one I improved my conditions  
But it doesn't feel like I wanted to feel  
Doesn't feel like I wanted it to feel  
Doesn't feel like I wanted to feel  
I needed the comfort of love  
Any place and anytime  
I need the comfort of love  
To just to get me some piece of mind, wo-oh  
I needed a comfort of love  
Any place and anytime  
I needed a comfort of love  
To just to get me some piece of mind  
Well, I needed the comfort  
I needed the comfort  
I needed the comfort of love  
I needed the comfort  
I needed the comforte

Got a good reason for taking the easy way out  
Got a good reason for taking the easy way out now  
  
She was a day tripper, a one way ticket yea  
It took me so long to find out, and I found out  
  
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there  
She's a big teaser, she took me half the way there now

What does she get for all the love she gave you  
There on the ladder of regrets?  
Mighty river, give her all she gets.  
What does she get for all the love she gave you  
There on the ladder of regrets?  
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets.  
  
Where all the prizes for the games she entered  
With little chance of much success?  
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets.  
  
Come on, river, all the flow  
Let your love of you people show.  
Come on, river, flow through me,  
Let your love of you people be.  
You are the river, I am the stream.  
Flow mighty river through me.  
  
What does it pay to play the leading lady  
When the like the damsel in distress  
Daytime nightime suffering is all she gets?  
  
No less (no less), no more (no more)  
No sea (no sea), no shore (no shore)  
No sand (no sand), no pail (no pail)  
No fairy tale anymore.  
  
Come on, river, flow through me  
Don't be stopped by insanity.  
Come on, river, overflow,  
Let your love for your neighbours show.  
You are the river, I am the stream.  
Flget it.  
But if we forget it every now and then.  
But if you don't feel it, later on you'll regret it.  
And if we let it we could set it free, you and me.

Well, the rain was a-failin'  
And the ground turned to mud  
I was watching all the people  
Running from the flood  
So I starred to payin'  
Though I ain't no prayin' man  
For the lord to come a helpin'  
Knowing he'd understand  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right  
  
Well, I had a woman  
She was good and clean  
She spent all day with the washing machine  
But when it come to lovin'  
She was never around  
She was out getting dirty  
All over town  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right  
  
Well, I was low on money  
And my truck broke down  
I was on my way to the lost and found  
So I took it to a dealer  
I said make it run  
Well, I ain't got no money  
But I got me a gun  
  
I said you robbed me before  
So I'm robbing you back  
And if it don't put you straight  
It'll put you on the right track  
Well, I ain't no devil and I ain't no saint  
But I can tell a dealer by the colour of his paint  
  
Deliver your children to the good good life  
Give'em peace and shelter and a fork and knife  
Shine a light in the morning and a light at night  
And if a thing goes wrong you'd better make it right  
  
If you want good eggs  
You gotta feed that hen  
And if you wanna hear some more  
Well, I'll sing it again.

What is this thing in life that persuades me to spend  
Time away from you?  
If you can answer this you can have the moon.  
This is the place to be, anyway you can see  
There's a lovely view.  
Why are there always so many other things to do?  
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head,  
When I'm alone I think of you  
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free  
From these distractions.  
  
The postman's at the door  
While the telephone rings on the kitchen wall,  
Pretend we're not at home and they'll disappear.  
I want to be with you, tell me what I can do,  
Nothing is too small  
Away from all this jazz we could do anything at all.  
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head.  
When I'm alone I think of you  
And the things we'd do if we could only be through  
With these distractions.  
I'll fond the peaceful place far a way from the noise of a busy  
Day  
Where we can spend our nights counting shooting stars,  
Distractions, like butterflies are buzzing 'round my head.  
When I'm alone I think of you  
And the things we'd do if we could only be through  
With these distractions, like butterflies they're  
Buzzing 'round my head, when I'm alone I think of you  
And the life we'd lead if we could only be free  
From these distractions.

Burn the midnight lamp  
Down until the dawn,  
I'll keep watch until I'm sure your coming home.  
Shadows play and flicker on the bedroom wall  
They turn into a bad dream overnight,  
Something could be terribly wrong.  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be, don't be careless.  
  
In my dream you're running nowhere  
Every step you've taken turns to glue,  
Walking down a spiral staircase  
Failing through, failing through,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Be careless love.  
  
The lamp burns down and out  
I'm getting pretty tired of this,  
I feel so bad something might be going amiss,  
  
I won't be there so look out for yourself  
You're getting in deep whatever you do,  
Don't let me go back to sleep,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be careless love,  
Don't be, don't be careless.  
  
Saw your face in the morning paper,  
Saw your body rolled up in a rug  
Chopped up into two little pieces  
By some thug,  
  
Don't be careless love,  
Be careless love.  
But in the morning light  
When I wake up again  
You're by my side and that's the way it's always been,  
But in the dark your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
Your mind plays funny tricks on you,  
  
Don't be careless love

Missed the Saturday dance  
Heard they crowded the floor  
Couldn't bear it without you  
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.  
  
Oh, darling I guess  
My mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless  
Why bring my memo, why bring my memo,  
Why bring my memories.  
  
Been invited on dates  
Might have gone but what for  
It's awfully different without you  
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.  
  
Thought I'd visit the club  
Got as far as the door  
They'd have asked me about you  
Don't Get Around Much Anymore.  
  
Oh, darling I guess  
My mind's more at ease  
But nevertheless  
Why bring my memo, why bring my memo,  
Why bring my memories.  
  
Oooooh.

Though some things in life are hard to bear  
Don't let it bring you down  
  
Should the sand of time run out on you  
Don't let it bring you down  
  
Don't go down - don't go underground  
Things seem strange, but they change  
How they change  
  
Up and down your carousel will go  
Don't let it bring you down  
  
Don't go down - don't get out of town  
Get to know how it goes, how it goes  
  
When the price you have to pay is high  
Don't let it bring you down.

Well you can dress me up as a robber  
But I won't be in disguise  
Only love is a robber  
And he lives within your eyes  
Ooh, ooh eee ooh  
  
You can dress me up as a sailor  
But I'll never run to sea  
As long as your love is available to me  
What do I do with a sea of blue?  
Ooh, eee ooh  
  
Dressing me up  
It doesn't make a difference  
What you want to do  
Whichever way you look at it  
I'm still in love with you  
If we go on forever  
I may never make a change  
  
Dressing me up  
And if I don't convince you  
You needn't look too far  
To see that I'm not lying  
'Cause I love you the way you are  
And what's the point of changing  
When I'm happy as I am?  
  
Well you can dress me up as a soldier  
But I wouldn't know what for  
I was the one that told you he loved you  
Don't want to go to another war  
No, no, no

One, two, three, four, five let's go for a drive  
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten let's go there and back again  
  
Something's open it's my heart  
If something's missing it's when we're apart  
If something's good it's when we're back together again  
  
Nothing's wrong it's just insane  
Nothing's right until you're back again  
Nothing's broken when it's softly spoken  
And we're walking slowly down the lane  
  
Why don't we drive in the rain  
Straight to the eye of the hurricane  
Go for a ride in the driving rain  
  
One, two, three, four, five let's go for a drive  
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten ooh ooh  
One, two, three, four, five let's go for a drive  
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten let's go there and back again  
Baby baby  
  
You come walking through my door  
Like the one that I've been waiting for  
Letting sunshine in the darkest places when I've been going there again  
  
So why don't we drive in the rain  
Straight to the eye of the hurricane  
  
Why don't we drive in the rain  
Straight to the eye of the hurricane  
Go for a ride in the driving rain  
One, two, three, four, five let's go for a drive  
Six, seven, eight, nine, ten ooh ooh  
One, two, three, four, five let's go for a drive

Six, seven, eight, nine, ten let's go back again  
One, two, three, four, five let's go for a drive

You come walking through my door

Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat at home.  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat at home, eat at home, eat at home.  
  
Bring the love that you feel for me  
Into line with the love I see,  
And in the morning you'll bring to me love.  
  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, now don't do that.  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, now don't do that, do that, do that.  
Ah, ah, ah.  
  
Come on, little lady,  
Lady, let's eat in bed,  
Eat in bed, eat in bed.

Ebony and ivory live together in perfect harmony  
Side by side on my piano keyboard, oh Lord, why don't we?  
  
We all know that people are the same where ever we go  
There is good and bad in ev'ryone,  
We learn to live, we learn to give  
Each other what we need to survive together alive.

Truth is only reality  
Nature truly is what we are  
Peace is only nature at rest  
Love is our true nature  
Love is all  
  
Truth and nature bring us peace and love  
Love is our true nature  
Love is all  
Love is our true nature  
Love is all  
  
Peace and love are all we long for  
Peace and love  
Truth is only reality  
Nature truly is what we are  
Peace and love are always our true nature  
Love is all  
  
Human nature, our true nature  
Love at peace with nature  
Human nature, human nature  
  
Therefore every one of us  
Has to find a strong foundation for a love  
Help us find a strong foundation for a love  
  
Although life sometimes is hard we still pull through  
Without truth false shades nothing else remains  
Without truth false shades nothing else remains  
But still we are able to pull through  
Even though we may have nothing else  
Nothing ever remains  
And then our feelings are threatened  
Unless we can pull through  
To the opposite side  
Nothing else remains

At the end of the end  
It's the start of a journey  
To a much better place  
And this wasn't bad  
So a much better place  
Would have to be special  
No need to be sad  
  
On the day that I die I'd like jokes to be told  
And stories of old to be rolled out like carpets  
That children have played on  
And laid on while listening to stories of old  
  
At the end of the end  
It's the start of a journey  
To a much better place  
And a much better place  
Would have to be special  
No reason to cry  
  
On the day that I die I'd like bells to be rung  
And songs that were sung to be hung out like blankets  
That lovers have played on  
And laid on while listening to songs that were sung  
  
At the end of the end  
It's the start of a journey  
To a much better place  
And a much better place  
Would have to be special  
No reason to cry  
No need to be sad  
At the end of the end

Would you care to sit with me  
For a cup of English tea  
Very twee, very me  
Any sunny morning  
  
What a pleasure it would be  
Chatting so delightfully  
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes  
Every Sunday morning  
  
Miles of miles of English garden, stretching past the willow tree  
Lines of holly, hocks and roses, listen most attentively  
  
Do you know the game crochet  
That adventure we might play  
Very gay, hip hooray  
Any sunny morning  
  
Miles of miles of English garden, stretching past the willow tree  
Lines of holly, hocks and roses, listen most attentively  
  
As a rule the church bells chime  
When it's almost supper time  
Nanny bakes, fairy cakes  
On a Sunday morning

I've got too much on my plate  
Don't have no time to be a decent lover  
I hope it isn't too late  
Searching for the time that has gone so fast  
The time that I thought would last  
My ever present past  
  
I've got too much on my mind  
I think of everything to be discovered  
I hope there's something to find  
Searching for the time that has gone so fast  
The time that I thought would last  
My ever present past  
  
The things I think I did  
I did, I did, I did  
The things I think I did  
When I was a kid  
  
I couldn't understand a word that they were saying  
But, still, I hung around and took it all in  
I wouldn't join in with the games that they were playing  
It went by, it went by, in a flash  
It flew by, it flew by, in a flash  
  
There's far too much on my plate  
Don't have no time to be a decent lover  
I hope it's never too late  
Searching for the time that has gone so fast  
The time that I thought would last  
My ever present past  
  
The things I think I did  
I did, I did, I did  
The things I think I did  
When I was a kid  
When I was a ...  
  
The things I think I did  
I did, I did, I did  
The things I think I did  
When I was a kid  
When I was a kid

Every night I just want to go out,  
Get out of my head  
Every day I don't want to get up,  
Get out of my bed  
Every night I want to play out  
And every day I want to do ooh ooh oh oh  
But tonight I just want to stay in  
And be with you,  
And be with you.  
  
Ooh...  
Ooh...  
Believe me mama  
  
Every day I lean on a lamp post,  
I'm wasting my time  
Every day I lay on a pillow,  
I'm resting my mind  
Every morning brings a new day  
Every night that day is through  
Ooh ooh oh oh  
But tonight I just want to stay in  
And be with you,  
And be with you.  
  
Ooh...  
Ooh...  
Believe me mama ooh...  
Ooh...

Hey, everybody out there,  
You know what it's like,  
When you haven't got a life,  
when you haven't got a life,  
Hey, do you want to make a difference?  
Well stand in the line,  
If you haven't got the time,  
I can give you some of mine,  
Never for the grace of god go you... And I,  
We're the brightest objects in the sky,  
Never for the grace of god go you... And I,  
Do some good before you say goodbye,  
  
Hey, I was trying to remember  
How bad it was then,  
When you didn't have a friend (x2)  
  
Hey everybody out there (ooh ooh ooh ooh),  
Everybody out there,  
Hey, everybody out there,  
Everybody out there.  
  
Never for the grace of god go you and I,  
We're the brightest objects in the sky,  
Remember never for the grace of god go you and I,  
Do some good before you say goodbye,  
  
Hey, everybody out there,  
Oh talk to me! I can't hear you, oh yeh yeh yeh yeh,  
Hey is anybody out there,  
I know what it's like (x2)  
Anybody out there, I can't hear you, I can't hear you,  
Everybody out there

Well you've got me dancing in a figure of eight,  
Don't know if I'm coming or going, I'm early or late.  
Round and round the ring I go,  
I want to know, I want to know,  
Why can't we travel a continuous line?  
Make love reliable covenant all the time.  
Up and down the hills I go, I got to know, I got to know.  
Is is better to love another  
Than to go go for a walk in the dark?  
Is it better to love than to give in to hate?  
Yeah we'd better take good care of each other  
Avoid slipping back off the straight and narrow,  
It's better by far than getting stuck in a figure of eight.  
  
Well figure it out for yourself little girl,  
It don't go nowhere at all,  
It's nothing more than a tape loop in a big dance hall.  
  
You've got me running  
  
You've got me running

A one, two  
  
There is a fine line  
Between recklessness and courage  
It's about time  
You understood which road to take  
It's a fine line  
When your decision makes a difference  
Get it wrong, you'll be making a big mistake  
  
[Chorus:]  
Come on brother  
All is forgiven  
We all cried when you were driven away  
Come on brother  
Everything is better  
Everything is better  
When you come home and stay  
  
Whatever's more important to you  
You've got to choose what you want to do  
Whatever's more important to be  
That's the view that you've got to see  
  
There is a long way  
Between chaos and creation  
If you don't say  
Which one of these you're gonna choose  
It's a long way  
And in every contradiction  
Seems to say  
It's a game you are bound to lose  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Come on back, come on back  
Come on back to me  
  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
Whatever's more important to you  
It's a fine line  
You've got to choose what you want to do  
It's a fine line  
Whatever's more important to be  
It's a fine line  
Well, that's the view that you've got to see  
  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line  
It's a fine line

You lift up my spirits, you shine on my soul  
Whenever I'm empty, you make me feel whole  
I can rely on you, to guide me through, any situation  
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me.  
  
You give me direction, you show me the way  
You give me a reason, to face every day  
I can depend on you, to send me to, any destination  
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me, follow me.  
  
Down the track of loneliness, down the path of love  
Through the words of heartache, to the end  
On the shores of sorrow, where the waves of hope crash in  
The perfect place for me to find a friend. Ahh yeah yeah yeah, oh  
  
You lead to places, that I've never been  
Uncovering secrets, that I've never seen  
I can rely on you, to guide me through, any situation  
You hold up a sign that reads, follow me, follow me,  
Follow me, follow me,  
Follow me, follow me

You day breaks, your mind aches  
You find that all her words  
of kindness linger on  
When she no longer needs you  
She wakes up, she makes up  
She takes her time and doesn't  
feel she has to hurry  
She no longer needs you  
  
And in her eyes, you see nothing  
No sign of live behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years  
  
You want her, you need her  
And yet you don't believe her  
When she says her love is dead  
You think she needs you  
  
And in her eyes, you see nothing  
No sign of live behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years  
  
You stay home, she goes out  
She says that long ago she knew someone  
but now he's gone  
She doesn't need him  
your day breaks, your mind aches  
There will be times when all the things  
she said will fill your head  
You won't forget her  
  
And in her eyes, you see nothing  
No sign of live behind the tears  
Cried for no one  
A love that should have lasted years

Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you  
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true  
I love you more than ever, girl, I do  
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you  
I want you at the moment I feel blue  
I'm living every moment, girl, for you  
I've loved you from the moment I saw you  
You looked at me that's all you had to do  
I feel it now I hope you feel it too  
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you  
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true  
I love you more than ever, girl, I do, I really love you

At last I've awakened to see what you've done  
All I can do is pack up and run  
Now I know the rules, find yourself another fool  
  
You said that you loved me, I was yours to command  
Your kind of loving, my heart couldn't stand  
You played me for a fool, find yourself another fool  
  
And now, now that we're through  
You say, you wished you'd be true  
Oh, but deep down in my heart  
I know our love could never grow  
  
And now, now that we're through

All I can do is pack up and run  
Now I know the rules, find yourself another fool

I was alone, I took a ride,  
I didn't know what I would find there  
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there  
  
Ooh, then I suddenly see you,  
Ooh, did I tell you I need you  
Every single day of my life  
  
You didn't run, you didn't lie  
You knew I wanted just to hold you  
And had you gone you knew in time we'd meet again  
For I had told you  
  
Ooh, you were meant to be near me  
Ooh, and I want you hear me  
Say we'll be together every day  
  
Got to get you into my life  
What can I do, what can I be,  
When I'm with you I want to stay there  
If I'm true I'll never leave  
And if I do I know the way there  
  
Ooh, then I suddenly see you,  
Ooh, did I tell you I need you  
Every single day of my life  
  
Got to get you into my life  
Got to get you into my life  
  
I was alone, I took a ride,  
I didn't know what I would find there  
Another road where maybe I could see another kind of mind there  
  
Then suddenly I see you,  
Did I tell you I need you...

We may find a trace  
Of a state of grace  
In the saddest face  
Something is there  
  
How the rivers flow  
We may never know  
But it goes to show  
Something is there  
  
This guiding light  
Will burn so bright  
So much wonder around us  
All the love in the air  
Let the good that surrounds us  
Help us to always care  
  
Then the seeds we sow  
Will survive and grow  
And we will all know  
Something is there  
  
This guiding light  
Will burn so bright  
So much wonder around us  
All the love in the air  
Let the good that surrounds us  
Help us to always care  
  
In this world where ever present dangers  
Circle round our family heart  
Like a throng of hostile strangers eager for a war to start  
There appears a friend's familiar face  
Oh sweet relief, the heart goes to a warmer place  
  
And this we prize  
And this we hold so dear  
This humble state of grace  
  
And this we prize  
For this we hold so dear  
This state of grace  
  
We may find a trace  
Of a state of grace  
In the saddest face  
Something is there  
  
How the rivers flow  
We may never know  
But it goes to show  
Something is there  
  
This guiding light  
Will burn so bright  
So much wonder around us  
All the love in the air  
Let the good that surrounds us  
Help us to always care  
  
Life aboard this fast revolver still remains a magic mystery  
Loud reports of anger fill the pages of our history  
Those of us with love can now embrace  
With sweet relief a life lived at a gentler pace  
  
And this we prize  
And this we hold so dear  
This humble state of grace  
  
And this we prize  
For this we hold so dear  
This humble state of grace  
  
In the night a daffodil  
Is battered by the father of all storms  
Daybreak sees it stand alone  
Amongst a field of lifeless forms  
Rays of light illuminate  
Where sweet relief presents a shining yellow face  
  
And this we prize  
And this we hold so dear  
This humble state of grace  
  
We may find a trace  
Of a state of grace  
In the saddest face  
Something is there  
  
How the rivers flow  
We may never know  
But it goes to show  
Something is there  
  
This guiding light  
Will burn so bright  
So much wonder around us  
All the love in the air  
Let the good that surrounds us  
Help us to always care  
  
Then the seeds we sow  
Will survive and grow  
And we will all know  
Something is there  
  
This guiding light  
Will burn so bright  
So much wonder around us  
All the love in the air  
Let the good that surrounds us  
Help us to always care  
  
And this we prize  
For this we hold so dear  
This humble state of grace

We were growing, time was going so fast  
Without knowing, we were growing up fast  
  
We were lying down, in the shade  
I remember the love we made  
  
We were lying down, on the bed  
I remember the tears we shared  
  
We were growing, time was going so fast, (Growing up)  
Without knowing, (Falling down) we were growing up fast (Growing up, Falling
down)  
(Growing up, Falling down)  
  
We were laughing to, we were so  
I remember the fun we had  
We were crying loud, with the pain  
We will never be here again  
  
Growing up, falling down

Peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday  
Wishful, not thinking what to do  
We've been calling it love  
But it's a dream we're going through  
  
And if I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
  
Restful, like Devon on a Monday  
Cooling my fingers in the bay  
We've been learning a song  
But it's a long and lonely blues  
  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
  
It's peaceful, like heaven on a Sunday  
Wishful, not thinking what to do  
We've been calling it love  
But it's a dream we're going through  
  
And if I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love  
Yours would be the one I'd choose  
If I only had one love

Said Farewell To My Last Hotel, It Was Never Much Kind Of Abode  
Glasgow Town Never Brought Me Down When I Was Heading Out On The Road  
Carlisle City Never Looked So Pretty And The Kendal Freeway's Fast  
Slowdown Driver, Want To Stay Alive, I Want To Make This Journey Last.  
Chorus  
Helen, Hell On Wheels, Ain't Nobody Else Gonna Know The Way She Feels  
Helen, Hell On Wheels, And They Never Gonna Take Her Away  
  
M6 South Down To Liverpool, Where They Play The West Coast Sound,  
Sailor Sam He Came From Birmingham But He Never Will Be Found  
Doing Fine When A London Sign Greets Me Like A Long Lost Friend,  
Mister Motor Won't You Check Her Out, She's Got To Take Me Back Again.  
  
Chorus

When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide  
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride  
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.  
  
Do you, don't you want me to love you  
I'm coming down fast but I'm miles above you  
Tell me tell me tell me come on tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.  
  
Helter skelter helter skelter  
Helter skelter.  
  
Will you, won't you want me to make you  
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.  
  
Look out helter skelter helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
  
Look out, cause here she comes.  
  
When I get to the bottom I go back to the top of the slide  
And I stop and I turn and I go for a ride  
And I get to the bottom and I see you again  
  
Well do you, don't you want me to make you  
I'm coming down fast but don't let me break you  
Tell me tell me tell me the answer  
You may be a lover but you ain't no dancer.  
  
Look out helter skelter helter skelter  
Helter skelter  
Look out helter skelter  
She's coming down fast  
Yes she is  
Yes she is.

To lead a better life, I need my love to be here  
Here, making each day of the year  
Changing my life with the wave of her hand  
Nobody can, deny that there's something there  
  
There, running my hands through her hair  
Both of thinking how good it can be  
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there  
  
I want her everywhere, and if she's beside me I know I'd need never care  
But to love her is to need her  
  
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there  
  
I want her everywhere, and if she's beside me I know I'd need never care  
But to love her is to need her  
  
Everywhere, knowing that love is to share  
Each one believing that love never dies  
Watching her eyes, and hoping I'm always there  
  
To be there and everywhere Here, there and everywhere

Hey, Jude, don't make it bad,  
Take a sad song and make it better.  
Remember to let her into your heart,  
Then you can start to make it better.  
  
Hey, Jude, don't be afraid,  
You were made to go out and get her.  
The minute you let her under your skin,  
Then you begin to make it better.  
  
And anytime you feel the pain,  
Hey, Jude, refrain,  
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders.  
For well you know that it's a fool  
Who plays it cool  
By making his world a little colder.  
  
Da da da da da da da da da.  
Hey, Jude, don't let me down,  
You have found her, now go and get her.  
Remember to let her into your heart,  
Then you can start to make it better.  
  
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin,  
You're waiting for someone to perform with.  
And don't you know that it's just you, hey Jude you'll do,  
The movement you need is on your shoulder.  
  
Da da da da da da da da da.  
Hey, Jude, don't make it bad,  
Take a sad song and make it better.  
Remember to let her under your skin,  
Then you begin to make it better  
Better, better, better, better wowwww  
Hey Jude  
Na na na na na na

Well, when I met you at the station  
You were standing with a bootleg in your hand.  
I took you back to my little place  
For a taste of a multicolored band.  
We're gonna get hi hi hi,  
The night is young.  
She'll be my funky little mama,  
Gonna rock it and we've only just begun.  
  
We're gonna get hi hi hi  
With the music on.  
Won't say bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
'Til the night is gone.  
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do it,  
Sweet banana, you'll never give up.  
We're gettin' hi hi hi in the midday sun.  
  
Well well, take off your face,  
Recover from the trip you've been on.  
I want to lie on the bed,  
Get you ready for my polygon.  
I'm gonna do it to you, gonna do it,  
Sweet banana, you've never been done.  
Yes, I go like a rabbit, gonna grab it,  
Gonna do it 'til the night is done.  
  
We're gonna get hi hi hi with the music on.  
Won't say bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye bye-bye  
'Til the night is gone.

Sweet banana, you'll never give up.  
We're gonna get hi hi hi, we're gonna get hi hi hi,

Evening brings the close of day,  
Skies of blue begin to grey,  
Crimson hues are fading in the west.  
Evening ever brings to me  
Dreams of days that used to be,  
Memories of those I love the best.  
  
When shadows fall  
And trees whisper, "Day is ending",  
My thoughts are ever wending home.  
When crickets call,  
My heart is forever yearning  
Once more to be returning home.  
  
When the hills conceal the setting sun,  
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one.  
Night covers all,  
And though fortune may forsake me,  
Sweet dreams will ever take me home.  
  
When the hills conceal the setting sun,  
Stars begin a-peeping, one by one.  
Night covers all,  
And though fortune may forsake me,  
Sweet dreams will ever take me home.

Come now lady don't you do me wrong.  
I fell for you and now it wont be long.  
Before I hold you in my arms.  
Before I take you to my heart again.  
  
Time is flying by us every day.  
I want to show my love in every way.  
I wanna hold you in my arms.  
I wanna take you to my heart again.  
  
If you believe it you can stay all night.  
Hide in the darkness til its getting light.  
Do everything until we've got it done.  
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
Hosanna, hosanna.  
Sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
  
Come down lady don't put up a fight.  
If you are true you know the time is right.  
For me to hold you in my arms.  
For me to take you to my heart.  
  
If you believe it we can stay all night.  
Hide in the darkness til its getting light.  
Do everything until we've got it done.  
Then sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
Hosanna, hosanna.  
  
Sing hosanna to the morning sun.  
Hosanna, hosanna

How kind of you to think of me  
When I was out of sorts  
It really meant a lot to be  
In someone else's thoughts  
Someone else's mind  
Someone else as kind, as you  
  
The thoughtfulness you showed has made  
A difference in my life  
I won't forget how unafraid  
You were that long dark night  
  
I thought that all was lost  
I thought I'd never find  
A someone quite as kind, as you  
  
I thought my faith had gone  
I thought there couldn't be  
A someone who was there, for me  
  
How kind of you to stick by me  
During the final bout  
And listened to the referee  
As I was counted out  
  
I thought my time was up  
I thought I'd never find  
A someone quite as kind, as you  
  
I thought my faith had gone  
I thought there couldn't be  
A someone who was there for me  
  
How kind of you to think of me  
How kind of you...

How many people stand in a line?  
How many people never get a chance to shine?  
If you can tell me I'll gladly listen  
How many people have died?  
  
One too many right now for me  
I want to be happy, I want to be free,  
One too many tight now for me  
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully.  
  
How many people, go for a ride  
How many people, never make it through to the other side?  
If you can tell me, I'll gladly listen,  
How many people have cried?  
  
One too many right now for me  
I want to be happy,  
I want to be free,  
One too many tight now for me  
I want to see ordinary people living peacefully.  
  
How many people, will I take? how many people  
For goodness sake?  
How many people?  
How many people?  
One too many

Ears twitch, like a dog,  
Breaking eggs in a dish.  
Do not mock me when I say  
This is not a lie.  
  
It's funny thing, half serious,  
With our hands on our ears.  
Living dreams with mouths ajar,  
Wide awake, we go to sleep.  
  
However absurd, however absurd  
It may seem.  
However absurd, however absurd  
It may seem.  
  
Something special between us,  
When we made love the game was over.  
I couldn't say the words,  
Words wouldn't get my feelings through,  
So I keep talking to you  
  
However absurd, however absurd  
It may seem.  
However absurd, however absurd  
It may seem.  
  
Custom made dinosaurs,  
Too late now, for a change.  
Everything is under the sun,  
But nothing is for keeps  
  
However absurd, however absurd  
It may seem.  
However absurd, however absurd  
It may seem.

You are my love, you are my song, liger on,

Last night you helped me through,  
Took me to the lovers zone.  
I saw there, images  
Projected on a wall of stone.  
I stood inside Egyptian temples,  
I looked into eternal gardens,  
Lay on the shores of distant islands,  
Listening to the sea birds song of joy.  
  
Oh, I owe it all to you,  
You make me happy,  
Oh, I owe it all to you.  
  
Late last night, we were right  
Into some exotic scene.  
Everywhere, images  
Appearing on a giant screen.  
I stood inside a glass cathedral,  
I looked into the golden canyon,  
Lay by the lakes of holy water  
Glistening like a diamond in the light.  
  
Oh, I owe it all to you,  
You make me happy,  
Oh, I owe it all to you.

1-2-3-4!  
  
Well, she was just 17,  
You know what I mean,  
And the way she looked was way beyond compare.  
So, how could I dance with another (ooh)  
And I saw her standin' there.  
  
Well she looked at me, and a I, I could see  
That before too long I'd fall in love with her.  
She wouldn't dance with another (whoo)  
And I saw her standin' there.  
  
Well, my heart went "boom,"  
When I crossed that room,  
And I held her hand in myeee-eee  
  
Whoa, we danced through the night,  
And we held each other tight,  
And before too long I fell in love with her.  
Now I'll never dance with another (whoo)  
And I saw her standing there (ahhh--ha-ha-ha)

Since I saw her standing there  
Oh, since I saw her standing there  
Yeah, well since I saw her standing there

Who knows how long I've loved you?  
You know I love you still  
Will I wait a lonely lifetime?  
If you want me to, I will  
  
For if I ever saw you  
I didn't catch your name  
But it never really mattered  
I will always feel the same

Love you whenever we're together  
Love you when we're apart

By dawn's first light I'll come back to your room again  
With my carnation hidden by the packages  
I'm carrying, something

Where we just meet  
She's just the girl for me  
And want all the world to see

Tonight, di-di-di-di'n'di  
  
Falling, yes I am falling  
And she keeps calling  
Me back again

The like of this, I've been alone  
And I have missed things  
And kept out of sight  
But other girls were never quite

Jet, Jet  
Jet I can almost remember their funny faces  
That time you told them you were going to marrying soon  
And Jet I thought the only lonely place was the moon  
  
Jet Jet Jet  
  
Jet was your father as bold as the sergeant major  
How come he told you that you were hardly old enough yet  
And Jet I thought the major was a lady suffragette  
  
Jet Jet Jet  
  
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Mater, much later

Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Mater want Jet to always love me  
Ah Mater...much later  
  
Jet with the wind in your hair  
Of a thousand laces  
Climb on the back and we'll go for a ride in the sky  
And Jet I thought the major was a little lady suffragette  
  
Jet-Jet-Jet  
And Jet you know I thought you was a little lady suffragette  
Jet  
A little lady  
My little lady, yes

You should have seen me with the pokerman  
I had no money and I bet a grand  
Just in the nick of time I look at his hand  
I was talking to an Eskimo  
Said he was hoping for a fall of snow  
When you popped a sealion ready to go.  
  
Let's go let's go let go let go  
Down to junior's farm  
Where I want to lay low  
How life high life  
Let's go let's go take me to the junior's farm.  
  
At the houses of parliament  
Ev'rybody's talking 'bout president  
We all chip in for a bag of cement  
Should have had more sense  
He bought a gee gee and it jumped a fence  
All for the sake of a couple of pence.  
  
Let's go, let's go, let go, let go...  
  
Let's go let's go down to Junior's farm  
Take me down to Junior's farm  
Ev'rybody tag along  
  
I took my bag into a grocer's store  
The price is higher than the time before  
Old man asked me why is it more  
I said you should have seen me with the pokerman  
I had no money and I bet a grand  
Just in the nick of time I looked at his hand.  
  
Let's go, let's go, let go, let go...

Lyrics by Mickjagger43

Lady Madonna, children at your feet  
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet  
Who finds the money? When you pay the rent?  
Did you think that money was Heaven sent?  
Friday night arrives without a suitcase  
Sunday morning creep in like a nun  
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace  
See how they run  
  
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast  
Wonder how you manage to feed the rest  
  
See how they run  
Lady Madonna, lying on the bed  
Listen to the music playing in your head  
  
Tuesday afternoon is never ending  
Wednesday morning papers didn't come  
Thursday night you stockings needed mending  
See how they run  
  
Lady Madonna, children at your feet  
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Do me a favor,  
Open the door and let 'em in  
Sister Suzie, brother John,  
Martin Luther, Phil And Don,  
Brother Michael, Auntie Gin,  
Open the door and let 'em in.  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Someone's knockin' at the door  
Somebody's ringin' the bell  
Do me a favor,  
Open the door and let 'em in.

When I find myself in times of trouble  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
And in my hour of darkness  
She is standing right in front of me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be.  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.  
  
And when the broken hearted people  
Living in the world agree,  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
For though they may be parted there is  
Still a chance that they will see  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be. Yeah  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
  
And when the night is cloudy,  
There is still a light that shines on me,  
Shine on until tomorrow, let it be.  
I wake up to the sound of music  
Mother Mary comes to me  
Speaking words of wisdom, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be.  
There will be an answer, let it be.  
Let it be, let it be,  
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be.

Ah, she tastes like wine  
Such a human being so divine  
Oh she feels like sun  
Mother nature look at what you're done  
  
Oh I feel like letting go  
Oh I feel like letting go.  
  
Ah, she looks like snow  
I want to put her in a broadway show  
Ah she'll dance and dine  
Like a lucifer she'll always shine  
  
Oh I feel like letting go  
Oh I feel like letting go.  
  
Oh I feel like letting go.  
  
Ah, she sings it so  
I want to put her on the radio  
One day and there you are  
Ladies and gentleman -  
A brand new star.  
  
Oh I feel like letting go  
Oh I feel like letting go

When the sky is filled up  
With stones and heavy rain  
And trouble starts sliding  
Across the way  
It's hard for me to see  
Which road I've got to take  
I know I need to find a way  
To leave it all behind  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
  
And when the light is filled up  
With storms and heavy rain  
And trouble comes sliding  
Across my mind  
It's hard for me to see  
Which road I've got to take  
I know I need to find a way  
To leave it all behind  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me  
Let it shine on  
Let it shine on  
Let the light from your lighthouse shine on me

Bend, little willow  
Wind's gonna blow you  
Hard and cold tonight  
  
Life, as it happens  
Nobody warns you  
Willow, hold on tight

I got a little woman I can really love,  
My woman fit me like a little glove.  
You know I'll always love  
My little woman love.  
  
I take her home most ev'ry night,  
My woman love to hold me tight.  
You know I feel alright  
My little woman mine.  
  
Oh yeah, oh yeah,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
Oh yeah, oh yeah,  
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.  
  
I take her home most ev'ry night,  
My woman love to hold me tight.  
You know I feel alright,  
My little woman mine.

Walking down the sidewalk one purple afternoon,  
I was accosted by a barker  
Playing a simple tune upon his flute.  
Toot toot toot toot.  
Silver rain was falling down  
Upon the dirty ground of London town.  
  
People pass me by on my imaginary street,  
Ordinary people it's impossible to meet,  
Holding conversations that are always incomplete.  
Well I don't know.  
  
Oh, where are there places to go?  
Someone, somewhere has to know.  
I'don't know.  
  
Out of work again, the actor entertains his wife  
With the same old stories of his ordinary life.  
Maybe he exaggerates the trouble and the strife.  
Well, I don't know.  
  
Oh, where are there places to go?  
Someone, somewhere has to know.  
  
Crawling down the pavement on a Sunday afternoon,  
I was arrested by a rozzer  
Wearing a pink balloon about his foot.  
Toot toot toot toot.  
Silver rain was falling down  
Upon the dirty ground of London town.  
  
Someone, somewhere has to know.  
Silver rain was falling down  
Upon the dirty ground of London town.

I tried to get over you  
I tried to find something new  
But all I could ever do  
Was fill, my time, with thoughts, of you  
  
I tried to go somewhere old  
To search for my pot of gold  
But all I could ever hold  
Inside, my mind, were thoughts , of you  
  
I hear your music and it's driving me wild  
Familiar rhythms in a different style  
I hear your music and it's driving me wild  
Again ohhh  
  
Don't want to let you take me down  
Don't want to get hurt 2nd time around  
Don't want to walk that lonely road again yeahh  
Ohh love you yeah

Oh no

There's a place where lovers go to cry their troubles away  
And they call it lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay  
You can buy a dream or two to last you all through the years  
And the only price you pay is a heartful of tears  
  
Goin' down to lonesome town, where the broken hearts stay  
Goin' down to lonesome town to cry my troubles away  
In the town of broken hearts the streets are paved with regret  
Maybe down in lonesome town I can learn to forget

Well, well, well, well, well,  
Do you love me like you know you ought to do?  
Well, well, well, well, well,  
Or is this the only thing you want me for?  
Well, I've been meaning to talk to you about it for sometime,  
Sweet little lass, you are my long haired lady.  
Who's the lady that makes that brief occasional laughter?  
She's the lady we wears those flashing eyes.  
Who'll be taking her home when all the dancing is over?  
I'm the lucky man she will hypnotize.  
  
Long haired lady, long haired lady.  
  
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long.  
Ah, when you're wrong, love is long, love is long.

Sweet little lass, you are my long haired lady.  
  
Bells are buzzing about my sweet delectable baby,  
Birds are humming about their big surprise.  
Who's your favorite person, dear phenomenal lady?  
I belong to the girl with flashing eye.  
  
Long haired lady, long haired lady.  
  
Ah, sing your song, love is long, love is long.  
Ah, love is long, love is long, love is long.

I saw a cat with a machine in his brain  
The man who fed him said  
He didn't feel any pain  
I'd like to see that man take out that machine  
And stick it in his own brain  
You know what I mean  
  
I saw a rabbit with its eyes full of tears  
The lab that owned her had  
Been doing it for years  
Why don't we make them pay for every last eye  
That couldn't cry its own tears  
Do you know what I mean  
  
When I tell you that we'll all be  
Looking for changes  
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures  
And we will learn how to grow  
  
Well I tell you that we'll all be  
Looking for changes  
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures  
And we will learn how to grow  
When we're looking for changes  
  
I saw a monkey that was learning to choke  
A guy beside him gave him cigarettes to smoke  
And every time that monkey started to cough  
The bastard laughed his head off  
Do you know what I mean  
  
When I tell you that we'll all be  
Looking for changes  
Changes in the way we treat our fellow creatures  
  
And we will learn how to grow  
  
When we're looking for changes  
We're looking for changes  
We're looking for changes  
We're looking for changes in the way we are und.  
Yeah yeah, off the ground.

My heart cries out for love  
And all that goes with loving  
Love in song - love in song  
  
My, you're so fine  
When love is mine  
I can't go wrong,  
Love in song - love in song  
  
I can see the places that  
We used to go to now  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
My eye cries out  
A tear still born  
Misunderstanding  
Love in song - love in song  
  
I can see the places that  
We used to go to now  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
Happiness in the homeland  
  
My, you're so fine  
When love is mine  
I can't go wrong,  
Love in song - love in song - love in song.
