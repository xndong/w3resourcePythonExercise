I'm sweatin' bullets for breakfast  
Slipping outta my range  
Another night on a meat hook  
Just tryin' to pickle my brain  
Why the hell are you running  
And what are you standing for  
A lightweight with the baggage  
Slung out the door  
  
So roll us on up in shrink-wrap  
It sounds like a good place to hide  
'Cause heads an' tails it's a night on  
We'll be there 'til the end of the line  
  
I asked out the back  
To find a word in a cloud  
Told me something that I already knew  
Now if you're waiting for luck  
To come and touch you up  
You better wear yourself a good-lookin' suit  
Don't you come around asking  
'Cause I ain't got an answerin' mind  
I'm gonna get real damn familiar  
With something with ice  
  
So set us on up in the corner  
And throw over that bottle 'o wine  
'Cause heads and tails it's a night on  
We'll be there till the end of the line  
We'll be there till the end of the line  
We'll be there till the end of the line  
Don't expect us now to understand  
Or trust in the way that it feels  
Chasin' up the coins into the ocean  
And choppin' up the carriages to fight the locomotion alright  
  
I had a win in Kansas  
A birthday in North Albany  
The most ungrateful tourist  
You ever dragged an old friend to see  
  
(Kick out the jams it ain't no fuckin' exam)

Lets take on the world, forget that you feel a girl  
Once you're away, everyones still the same  
If I could rip at your shirt just to see if it'd hurt  
Everyday's golden day, when you've got someone to blame  
Could you feel so much in a bus you're sure there's nothing you can trust  
Once you're away, everyone stabs the same  
Sleep forever on your breast treat everyday now like a test  
But you'll still say everyone's to blame  
  

Got a kiss on the neck from a mornin' cartoon  
Pullin' out the knot, I just can't lose  
Grabbin' my shoulder, turned out the night  
Like a smile after you've cried  
  
The lady out walkin' with her popcorn pup  
To get out and smoke before her husband wakes up  
Eyes to the asphalt, plastic bag hands  
Just get on outta there, just get away from that man  
  
Well I'm all thumbs and toes  
With the way that it comes and the way that it goes  
  
(Get up, get up)  
I gotta loosen this load  
(Get up, get up)  
Get some fire in my throat  
(Get up, get up)  
  
See the man in the corner tryin' to make em all smile  
And missin' the one who matters all the while  
And she'll beat him senseless but he just can't see  
It ain't for the crowd that you bleed  
  
So be good to your barkeep man  
Its more than yer drink, he's got his hand  
Can see that your nervous and it shits him to tears  
Yeah he just don't want to wait and he don't care about your band  
  
Well I'm all thumbs and toes  
With the way that it comes and the way that it goes  
  
(Get up, get up)  
I gotta loosen this load  
(Get up, get up)  
And put some fire in my throat  
(Get up, get up)  
  
I need a life dedicated  
Not this endless parading  
Help me, alright  
  
(Get up, get up)  
Yeah I gotta loosen this load  
(Get up, get up)  
And get some fire in my throat  
(Get up, get up)  
  
I want a life dedicated  
Not this endless parading  
Help me, alright  
  
I need to do more, but I ain't been sleeping  
For the longest time  
For the longest time  
For the longest time  
  
If I could live for one day without being sorry I know  
One day without being sorry, I know  
One day without being sorry, I know  
One day without being sorry

Been living underwater but I sure dug the sea  
But no-one could hear me out when I leant back to scream  
Coming through the shelves to live in the dirt  
To keep from the sun, to keep from getting hurt  
Gettin' gone  
You got a lot to learn  
Ahh got a lot to learn from getting  
Gone gone gone  
Been feeding on contributions from the folks on the bridge  
Throw the scraps on out when they need a trip  
So I flap my tail and give a high-pitched squeak  
Just so they could leave me in between the rocks to sleep  
Gettin' gone  
I wasted so much time that I  
Oh wouldn't swap the line of getting  
Gone gone gone  
You got a lot to learn  
Ahh got a lot to learn from getting  
Gone gone gone  
I don't know where the sadness starts  
'Coz I'm so happy I could die  
Just give me long enough to live  
Yeah an' it's only when I fly  
I wasted so much time that I  
Oh wouldn't swap the line of getting  
Gone gone gone  
You got a lot to learn  
Ahh got a lot to learn from getting  
Gone gone gone  
  

If you tuned in correctly this morning  
Kissed his cheek, get your tea and your toast in  
Got the greatest of the latest Top Thirty  
To clear your mind of all things unfaithful or dirty  
What do you like to hear with your soldiers?  
The sponsor needs to know what you told us  
Got a chorus written for us straight from the file  
Just check your brain into the AM dial

Never wanted more  
From my local store  
A chance to be by myself  
Be on the right side of the shelf  
But for every drink I serve  
Sure wish I had callous nerve  
Cause for every sandwich I know  
There's a sack of shit to be dosed  
Wash my hands in shame  
4000 times a day  
And when I make it on home  
There's a smell that always stays  
I know the regulars well  
From every stale grill I sell  
From bainmaries to cold tea  
I'm the service that you need  
There's a poison in my drink  
It's gonna take each good thought I could think  
There's a poison I know  
Wash my hands in shame  
4000 times a day  
For while I service your greed  
I'm just dying to be clean

Walks like a crooked tooth  
And sleeps with a Dexedrine smile  
Keeps finding the holes where old memory can go  
And wash it down liquefied  
Keep that old door swinging  
'Cause you can be the freeloader  
When it's closing time  
When it's closing time  
What you gonna do? It's nothing to see  
But something's got you down on your knees  
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts  
And it ain't falling down by degrees  
I think I'm gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Your walls are plastered with ham-fist drunks  
And fagans wrapped in denim and smoke  
So tell me what chance did you happen to dance  
With the step that kicked your feet in the boat?  
Loose band on the radio  
All static and clashin' a hob-nailed hint  
You're never losing ground  
It's just the way it sounds  
What you gonna do? It's nothing you see  
But something's got you down on your knees  
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts, yeah  
And it ain't falling down by degrees  
I think I'm gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
You cover me like the sunshine kisses the day  
But a pulse starts in my gut now  
And it's gonna make us pay  
What you gonna do? It's nothing to see  
But something's got you down on your knees  
I'm crawling through the dirt to see where it hurts  
And it ain't falling down by degrees  
I think I'm gonna die  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Trying to kick a hole in the sky  
From trying to kick a hole in the sky  
Oh, bring it on!

I'm sure I could make your hand fit mine  
If I deliver these custard trays on time  
Four-thirty A.M. ding-dong rise  
I kiss her photo with the beam from the ash tray light  
I'm sure I could deliver better  
If I pretended I'd never met her  
She said she'd love me sweeter  
If we made it to the pier for dinner  
Seven months in a ditch for the ring kept for her to decide  
If my milk truck's going to be her chariot ride  
Four-thirty A.M. ding-dong rise  
Morning sun makes my sour heart pasteurise  
I'm sure I could deliver better  
If I pretended I'd never met her  
She said she'd love me sweeter  
If we made it to the pier for dinner  
Welsh rarebit with a new dress on  
If that ain't enough to make you smile  
Every Kintail Road kid knows  
When she's around then cheese goes dry

He made the news today for the first time on page three.  
Left the local supermarket job in sale and figures.  
Makes a treat each week, tomorrow sits at home.  
He'd be such a lovely boy if he'd only leave the girls alone.  
You could see it in his face  
Each time he ran away.  
  
It was a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
Bathroom porcelain and handles made of brass.  
Took the proper grooming and full year language class.  
They're sure he's the guy to snatch them from this scene  
and take them to some place they're sure their mother's never been.  
You could see it in his face  
As the colour drained away.  
  
It was a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
Cold evenings create a living room dance.  
Spend late nights revolving around one lost chance.  
Oh yeah.  
  
They're gonna jump the train it's the last one today.  
Join us in the back row of the ones that got away.  
Join a big parade, it works for you and me.  
And you'll add a thrill because you'll hear it on TV.  
Throw it up against the wall  
Just to see how far it falls.  
'cause it's a ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.  
A ba-ba-ba-ba-ba big opportunity.

We're so ordinary  
Can't seem to break the hold  
Of every clown that's come before us  
And every story that's yet to be told  
And even though the paint's not dry yet  
There's someone with their tongue hanging out  
'Cause something sour don't taste so bad  
When you can muzzle someone needs to shout  
And everyone who's watching now  
At the movie that's always re run  
Can throw a laugh and a stick in the pinks  
Who overrated or loud or were young  
And anyone who's looking out  
Just waiting for tall guys to fall  
Can rest assured in blankets now  
That nobody can be that small  
  
Bring him round the court house now  
We're lying naked and ugly and cold  
Don't play around the edges  
Play with something that's dusted and old  
And when we're lying crying defensless  
Be sure that you get in a lay  
'Cause something sour don't taste so bad  
Now they'll be forgetting you everyday  
  
And everyone who's watching now  
At the movie that's always re run  
Can throw a laugh and a stick in the pinks  
Who overrated or loud or were young  
And anyone who's looking out  
Just waiting for tall guys to fall  
Can rest assured in blankets now  
That nobody can be that small

Grab a six pack for the way home.  
It's only twenty five minutes alone  
At a chance to listen to what you see fit  
Put your tail between your legs and you split  
Was never one for luck  
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck  
Never bother with FM radio  
Pop a compilation tape and we'll go  
But every dick that comes from the hills  
Is gonna innundate you still  
Never one to let something go  
To make you hate or cuss at folks you don't know  
As his girlfriend takes the last mushroom slice  
You hope they never make their movie on time  
Was never one for luck  
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck  
Never bother with FM radio  
Pop a compilation tape and we'll go  
But every dick that comes from the hills  
Is gonna innundate you still  
Nineteen to twenty two  
Just Nik, Jaimme, red wine and you  
Into the Datsun and go  
To another Massappeals show  
Was never one for luck  
On a pay rise or a girl you got stuck  
Never bother with FM radio  
Pop a compilation tape and we'll go  
But every dick that comes from the hills  
Is gonna innundate you still

Brush your hair to some Eurodisco trash  
Two prophylactics and forty-five dollars cash  
Corduroy jacket and some fifty buck shoes  
That can lead like a lamp when they're a scrubbing up new  
Sunday best on a Friday night alright  
I'll meet you at the corner beneath the Goodyear foot sign  
Where all dates are made by mobile  
I'll send you a smoke signal just be there by nine  
  
This smoke, I left it for you  
To show Mum and Dad your new tattoo alright  
So they're my plans, how'd they fit with you?  
  
There's a streetlight for each night your heart hit the deck  
This drink says I love you, this drink says I couldn't care less  
Kiss me so I know I'm alive  
The drinks taste crap but they keep coming til five  
  
Numbers on the wall, I got my ears like a shell  
The phone stinks of chips, cheap wine, mouthwash and gel  
C'mon we'll drink the last of the rent  
And I'll leave my number right down on the strap of your dress  
  
And it's late, and she's Sue  
'cause I read it on the back of her boyfriends neck alright  
So they're my plans, how'd they fit with you?  
  
Yeah, I had a plan, but how'd it fit with you?

When I was in grade six  
I used to hold open a door for a girl and she called me a wimp.  
Said there's just no need to be so fucking polite  
I politely agreed with her, I think she was right.  
It just never entered my mind  
That a twelve year old came down to choosing sides.  
You said I'd die if I had nothing to do  
Put a drink in my hand and I'll talk to anything that moves.  
I just refuse to give you what you think would make things right.  
Just to find hate when you've lost the will to fight.  
And would it be really in touch with the times  
To put somebody down for choosing sides.  
  
And you said show us them teeth  
Give us them braces.  
Show us the dental work that puts fear in twelve year old faces.  
I can make you feel even half worthwhile  
But please don't ask me to smile.  
  
And times when it still feels right  
I'll hold open a door for a girl or back down from a fight.  
And if there's just no need to be so fucking polite.  
At least it helps you sleep easier at night.  
Just never entered my mind  
That ever should come down to choosing sides.  
  
And you said show us them teeth  
Give us them braces.  
Show us the dental work that puts fear in twelve year old faces.  
I can prove to you that I do or don't get high  
But please don't ask me to smile.

Don't you wish that your kids all looked more fine?  
Do you feel that your guy's below your style?  
Animal slippers and a drink over Sunday mail  
Coffee teeth and a cigarette heart for sale  
Any minute now something's gonna happen  
Everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in  
  
Mailman, black umbrella  
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya  
Sure have looked better  
And ego kissing fools  
Are teaching your kids in private schools  
Crack another bottle, it's five  
  
Monday morning who could ask for more  
Smoking buds, got your friends all 'round next door  
  
Any minute now something's gonna happen  
Everything's falling 'cept the shit you fell in  
  
Mailman, black umbrella  
Doesn't feel the need to tell ya  
Kudzu Cinderella.  
Them ego kissing fools  
Are teaching your kids in private schools  
Crack another bottle, it's five

Got a new haircut  
It cost me just six bucks  
Filled a plastic bag with the stuff I need in a big dumb car I'm off my knees  
Fill it up and make me start again  
Ooh it's the rumble and moan  
Transistor AM cassette drone  
It's the sound without a home address and hydromatic hopelessness  
Fill it up and start over again  
Yeah fill it up and start over again and again  
All night!  
R. A. D. I. O.  
Hit me hard and hit me low  
Static engine blow the scene, rumble in the old machine  
R. A. D. I. O.  
Ah, hit me just like Lionel Rose  
R. A. D. I. O.  
I heard stomach and soul  
A rumble underneath my toes  
And it didn't come with a clear face, designer punk or daily rate  
Fill it up and make it start again  
Yeah fill it up, don't make me start again and again  
All night!  
R. A. D. I. O.  
Hit me hard and hit me low  
Static engine blow the scene a rumble in the old machine  
R. A. D. I. O.  
Ah hit me just like Lionel Rose  
R. A. D. I. O.  
A rumble in the old machine  
R. A. D. I. O.  
A rumble in the old machine  
R. A. D. I. O.  
Yeah, a rumble in the old machine  
R. A. D. I. O.  
A rumble in the old machine  
Ronnie James D. I. O.  
Fell down like Bocephus under all the noise and grease  
Automatic mono-style rip me up, monkey style

Get the lead on out 'cause it's my round  
And I punched the van 'cause I lost the sound  
And then I fell on down, oh yeah  
I ain't old enough to have walked the line  
But I've circled this room for the twenty fifth time  
  
For a fortunate son I'm such a jealous guy  
Got a bone to pick I dunno why  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
Hey hey yours for ten  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
  
What I gave away and what I left behind  
Swallowed history like a five an' dine  
And then I fell on down oh yeah  
Y'all knew the guy he was the king of the kids  
Threw his trophies to the sky as he jumped from the bridge yeah  
  
For a fortunate son I'm such a jealous guy  
Got a bone to pick I dunno why  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
Hey hey yours for ten  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
  
And if you're looking for the guy who can see  
With some of these damn apologies  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
  
Hey hey yours for ten  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
Hey hey your foot down  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
Hey hey get on up  
I fell on down I'm gonna do it again  
A bottle o' wine and Patsy Cline  
But what would I do with a satisfied mind  
Oh yeah  
What would I do?

Your eyes hit a gilded window  
When the Housewives Journal, started closing every door  
The wind's so strong and you decided  
That you just don't want to be carried with it anymore  
"Oh my God" the neighbors  
Just can't put a word to it never seen to write or call  
Greetings to the sister  
As you're strutting through your suburb watching ladies trip and fall  
She came when he left, never thought it was a big decision  
Gave up on lives that revolve around car ignition  
Hey did you ever get the feeling everything is working out okay?  
Sunday afternoon sure used to sting until  
The drinks kick in at ten  
But now you've joined a collective  
Surely nothing ordinary kicking up a storm again  
"Oh my God" the neighbors  
Just can't put a word to it never seen to write or call  
Greetings to the sister  
As you're strutting through your suburb watching ladies trip and fall  
Came when he left, never thought it was a big decision  
Gave up on lives that revolve around beer and fishing  
Hey did you ever get the feeling everything is working out okay?

We're on the corner every morning just to see you get across  
The civic fathers divide us up into cats and dogs  
The sergeant major of the neighbourhood is weighing up the cost  
The senior transit lane  
While we're standing in the rain  
Worried if our head will fall  
Alright, right  
We'll stay together 'til the kids die just to keep it clean  
Buy the weapons with the sales made from garden magazines  
Strike up the ladies to bake tea cakes for the council's war machine  
And they're digging up the roads  
And widening it just so  
You can suffocate at home  
Alright, right  
The Prince of Wales tea  
To keep the garden green  
But they don't want to be there  
The shit can't be there  
You woke me up just to check that I'm alive  
We talk to each other as if we're five  
Raise open the flag just to see which of us cares  
And they're digging up the roads  
And widening it just so  
You can suffocate at home  
Alright, right  
Alright, alright, alright, alright

I can read your degree and now give me my medicine  
Cause every drink is a poison and I think I'm Judas Christ again  
She's got a feeling its a sound I'm faking  
I got a feeling each corner's an ending  
Each minute is a dollar you can pay back your parents with  
I got a brand new vein you can tap on in and since  
Now that you've got the power of mercy  
And the chance to figure out just where I've been lately  
Now that you've got a sniff of pharmaceutic  
That can kill anything in my head that's electric  
And I'm alone with sound  
Now that you've got the power prescription  
Please make me interesting  
When I'm all done with sound  
Read my mind  
Cause I won't give sign  
She's got a feeling its a sound I'm faking  
I got a feeling each corner's an ending  
Its all sound....  
  

It's irregular and it sure won't pay  
but say naught 'til you got something to say  
So I live for forty minutes a day  
Can I have that?  
The biggest kick you ever got  
was paying out on dinosaur rock  
and said with every prehistoric thought  
you can stain  
For every door that's been closed  
there's another of your friends you can dose  
While your brains seem to speak through your clothes  
And for every handshake that'll pay  
there's another motherfuck who'll complain  
that to keep a legal dose is so lame  
Are you stray?  
Those born with gold with weary souls  
Should eat their young and die  
Are you stray?

Sugar sit a while  
come and rest your feet  
Its been a long long while  
since you were been close to me  
  
Lets polish of a few  
Underneath the sky  
Its pulling all its faces  
You want to stand real quiet  
and see just what it brings  
we've been running too much  
need to miss out on a few things  
  
[Chorus]  
If we just get it on  
Tease and treat me wrong  
Birds do it  
Bees do it  
Drop right down to my knees to do it  
Just get me on my feet again  
Get me on my feet again  
  
Swinging like a tire  
Princess off the beat  
Telephone wires with all  
Explode at your feet  
  
I'm running out of blood  
But i'm never cold  
But I need to jump those fences  
Holding neath the show  
Cause I see just what I need  
So drag this boy on over  
Let him fall real deep  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sugar I'm a mess  
But its where I want to be  
I want to burn out with a smile  
That cuts right through my teeth  
  
Everyone gets rained  
Rained on just the same  
But lately its been soaking  
Us right to the veins  
And we're running out of time  
So drag this boy on over  
And keep him til its light  
  
Can we just get it on  
Tease and treat me wrong  
Them birds do it  
Them bees do it  
Drop right down to my knees to do it  
Just get me on my feet again  
Just get me on my feet again  
Just get me on my feet again  
Get me on my feet again

I'm gonna walk myself into town and ride on back  
Guess it means you're quick and I'm clean  
My sparkling machine  
It's only forty minutes by feet  
I'll be back in three  
Ride to the hills at night  
To watch the lights go down and your neighbours fight  
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night  
  
It's a magic carpet and chrome  
Can't reach me by phone  
A new deck of cards through the wheels  
To show you just deep I feel  
In the rear view mirrors I see  
My dust as you're following me  
Drag to the corner at night  
To watch the lights go down and your parents die  
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night.  
I'm the boy to keep you up at night.  
  
To keep you decent seven days a week  
'Cause it's the second best thing I do with my feet  
Watch your ass 'cause I know where you live  
And which car you drive.  
  
I can look anyone in the eye  
Eat my dust as I leave you behind  
I'll follow you to your house  
Do you want to kiss at mine?  
'Cause I'm the boy to keep you up at night  
I'm the boy to keep you up at night  
I'm the boy to keep you up at night

Saw the sun come up again.  
Last week's papers and a pack of darts  
That got me through 'til ten.  
The ten fifteen's five minutes late.  
I really should just get out more these days.  
Next door is coughing up his lungs.  
Two A.M. I'm sure she said  
She's gonna get herself a gun.  
I blacked out from three to five.  
You should hear what's going on outside.  
  
As the morning bread goes hard  
On the corner shop they're waiting  
Just for rush hour to start.  
And I'm wondering why his kids are late  
I really should just get out more these days.  
  
Days, and each one shows  
There's so much I'll never know  
If I don't ever get  
If I never get home, home.  
  
And old Ryan's still his rust  
And Tuesday comes and goes  
Like any late night bus.  
I could do a lot more with my time  
But you should hear what's going on outside.

Walter quit the RAF  
When there was no good air left.  
Made it back to the clan.  
The dog, the wife, the betting slip wet in his hand.  
And no one's listening.  
To the boys  
Tim, Jaimme and Gab.  
Keeping him up while his mistress rings his hands.  
Picked him up after school  
Just make sure you're looking good.  
And no one's leaving.  
  
Walter plays.  
Get off your knees.  
Walter plays.  
Get off your knees.  
  
It's mini coke and prawns again  
In his room or on the sand.  
Not a day before he fell  
Propping up the bar at the Raffle's hotel.  
And no one' leaving.  
  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees.  
Give the kids a hand  
Down on the sand.  
  
No one's listening.  
Walter plays  
Get off your knees.  
Give the kids a hand  
Down on the sand.

You drive me to drink  
But I'm in for the whole trip I promise  
You won't go out with the drunk on the road  
Or use yer fork to search for the toast  
Girl I ain't easy  
And any ass could see  
But I can't believe  
Just watcha doin' to me  
I'm falling this way and I  
I'm stumbling over there but I  
Can't believe watcha doin' to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I can't believe watcha doin to me  
Shake my trunk  
And I wake like from a three day drunk  
As my branches hit the ground  
I'm finally comin around  
Bury me deep in my  
Oh my wedding shoes  
Lay me flash  
Just fifty bucks cash it's the  
One day I never wanna lose  
I'm falling this way and I  
I'm stumbling over there but I  
Can't believe watcha doin' to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I can't believe watcha doin to me  
I'm falling this way and I  
I'm stumbling over there but I  
Can't believe watcha doin' to me  
The sweetest sound yeah  
To knock this lightweight down but I  
I can't believe watcha doin to me  
I never felt so jealous or felt so alive  
I feel like I could run  
I feel like I could die  
I can't believe watcha doin' to me  
I can't believe watcha doin' to me  
  

Well who'd of thought and who could know?  
That time was ever gonna go this darn slow  
And she's late and you just don't know  
If you're ever gonna get on through this year alone  
It was the way she put her hand on her hip  
The sparkle in her eye  
But you wonder if its gonna be there all the time  
Leaves they fall  
You know you're never gonna sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow  
And he's a fake yeah  
From his smile to the tatts right there on his toes  
But you're just not sure if you're ever  
Gonna get through this year alone  
He don't hold your hand just when you need  
And you're sure that twinkle in his eye  
Ain't just there for you  
but you can't ignore that  
He sure looks like your dad  
When can still look straight at night  
When he tucks you in and kisses your belly  
And strokes your hair so you just don't cry  
Leaves they fall  
You know you're never gonna sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow  
You sure wish you knew who was on the halfback flank  
About twenty years  
When you took those flags onback to back  
Would sure make the stand offs and make more sense  
If you could stand toe to toe  
And who took the bench  
But not this silent treatment  
That leaves you wondering if this baby's heaven sent  
It was the way she put her hand on her hip  
The sparkle in her eye  
But you wonder if it's gonna be there all the time  
Leaves they fall  
You know that you can never sweep em all  
And weeds they grow  
And peeking out all through the grass and snow

This whole day was useless  
Next one's gonna be worse  
'cause I'm wearing this badge of fortune like  
A criminals wears a curse  
I want to chase that rabbit right off the rails  
And rip this metal keeping my mouth in check  
But I need that muzzle like a razor and a stubble  
Cuttin all this history from my neck  
Do you remember the gear I first saw you in  
Eating Mexican in '92?  
In between your folks and a birthday toast  
It was black from your fringe to your shoes  
I'm picking apples out of paintings  
And making record covers in the sky  
I missed my boat sitting here imagining  
Your face when you cry  
  
Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
  
This whole day threw up some tickets  
None I'd ever choose  
The sky's so heavy it hangs like a beer gut  
Spilling stuff on my shoes  
Don't get me wrong, I ain't complaining  
I still got my legs like an old Christmas tree  
But if I got faith why am I so scared  
Everybody's dying on me  
  
Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
Don't be cruel, come on be champagne in my shoe  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
  
Fish and chips stall down the south coast ready  
I can show you what I'm worth  
So set me up a bottle and salt and vinegar  
If you get there first  
I said if you get there first  
  
Don't be cruel, come on be sugar in my tooth  
I think I like what I don't know about you  
Don't be cruel, come on be champagne in my shoe  
I think I like what I don't know about you

I got too much on my mind  
Yeah, so play that thing in a different style  
Caught on a hook and a line  
Yeah, thicken, use and drive me outta my mind  
So I'm down, so punch me in the decals  
And see which of my teeth tells  
The honor of thieves, hard to prove  
But who put the devil in you?  
I got too much on my mind  
I cross my chest to keep myself in line  
Willing the water from wine  
I've wasted years looking for somewhere to hide  
Lookin' down, just kick me where the sun shines  
And now we're on for hot times  
And bashin' out to hammer the blues  
Yeah, who put the devil in you?  
I'm finding out where my head's at  
Like loose change in a laundromat  
It chews me through  
From Dallas Crane to Motley Crue, oh  
Yeah, but I know just why I'm masquerading  
And why my tracks is fading  
And bash out to hammer the blue  
Who put the devil in you?  
I hit on the speed in my shoe  
Now who put the devil in you?  
'Cause you know we're going out there again  
I'm just throwing my trust to the wind  
We're gonna beat this damn thing to the end  
And then kiss it off, hey  

When the day falls where do you go?  
Six thirty, city windows dirty.  
Office nightclubs, drinks, dates and movie stubs.  
Be wary all secretaries.  
And eyes roam for who takes who home  
As the rain's coming down to Friday night.  
Don't let me down again.  
  
Passport pictures with charts and figures.  
Daily nightly. Oh, like me tightly.  
When the day falls where do you go?  
Ten thirty, like me tightly.  
  
And eyes roam for who takes who home  
As the rain's coming down to Friday night.  
Don't let me down again.  
  
Don't let me down again.

You couldn't have took it any harder  
You couldn't have put it anymore sweet  
But every bone of yours for picking  
Is every bone they picked of meat  
Now you're loaded, lonely and on her mind  
Now you're loaded, bloated, but it's only 'til next time  
When every cut on the wall becomes a curse  
Cut yourself real deep before they get in first.  
Take each good word like a crucifx  
You gave up the dte for a mouth of dirt.  
Now you're loaded, lonely and on her mind  
Now you're loaded, bloated, but it's only 'til next time  
You scare me blind  
Can't help but take each day as another call  
To arms in the hero victim's cause  
And every bone you left out for picking  
Is gonna stick in the throat of everyone that you never called.  
It's only, loaded on her mind  
It's only, loaded but it's only 'til next time  
You scare me blind
