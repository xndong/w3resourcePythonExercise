We'll raise the price of parking fines  
A boost for the economy  
If that don't work we close the mines  
And starve the poor of industry  
  
We proved again we rule the waves  
A blow for white democracy  
That Britain's never shall be slaves  
So long as they agree with me  
  
We'll close the roads, divide the land  
Put out the rage that burns within  
Break the link of dirty hands  
At any cost we'll always win  
  
Keep them poor and wanting more  
Deprive them of their basic rights  
The hunger banging at their door  
Will take away their will to fight  
  
As always you were wrong again  
To us a little seems a lot  
Don't turn your back on desperate men  
Cause we can see how much you've got

Baby be true and I'll give my love to you,  
I need you baby.  
Treat me right and I'll love you day and night,  
I mean it baby.  
  
When you're down I'll be around,  
To guide you baby.  
When you're free just call on me, baby.  
I'll give my heart to you , now babe.  
I'll do what you ask me too, now babe.  
I mean it baby.  
  
  
I'm gonna treat you, treat you right  
I'm gonna love you day and night  
I'm gonna give my heart away  
I'm gonna love you night and day  
Baby, baby.

If you really love me  
then don't buy me a ring  
diamonds and pearls  
they don't mean anything  
all that i want  
is already here  
sitting by my side  
you've got nothing to fear  
  
CHORUS  
  
Fifty man dead for this golden band  
underground with a pick in their hand  
cutting dirt where the sun not shine  
digging to survive in the mans gold mine  
how many dead for this royal crown  
this holy shrine we gather round  
worship the dollar pon your hands and knees  
humbled in the presence of your jewelery  
  
CHORUS  
  
Ali's bit

Wise men say, only fools rush in.  
But I can't help falling in love with you  
  
As the river flows  
Gently to the sea  
Darling so we go  
Some things were meant to be  
  
Take my hand  
Take my whole life too  
Cause I can't help falling in love with you  
  
As the river flows  
Gently to the sea  
Darling so we go  
Some things were meant to be  
  
Take my hand  
Take my whole life too  
Cause I can't help falling in love with you

Come back darling  
Give me another try  
I'll make you satisfied  
Don't you know, I need you badly  
And I'll give my poor heart gladly  
I need your love like roses need the rain  
Don't let me cry in pain  
Come back darling  
Give me another try  
I'll make you satisfied  
Can't you see the love still burning  
Please return, relieve my yearning  
A day without you is like a year of emptiness  
Please return and bring me happiness  
Come back darling  
Give me another try  
I'll make you satisfied

He used to think that it was neat  
When he hung out on the street  
Now that it's his daily beat, he's not so sure  
'Cause he's come to depend  
On a street with a dead end  
And he'll sell you his best friend, so he can score  
  
[Chorus]  
Boys and girls come out to play  
The junk mans on the streets to say  
He'll make your dreams feel real today  
And steal your minds tomorrow  
  
Now his thoughts don't seem so clear  
His whole life is filled with fear  
His habit cost him dear in every way  
His girl can't take the heat  
  
But his friends all cross the street  
Still the needle keeps him sweet  
If he can pay for one more day  
  
His bones have got no meat  
He's unsteady on his feet  
And he doesn't get to eat, not every day  
What started out for kicks  
Has become a daily fix  
And his girlfriend's turning tricks to pay his way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Boys and girls come out to play  
The junk man's on the streets to say  
He'll make your dreams feel real today  
And steal your minds tomorrow

Cover up  
With loving protection  
Guard your love  
In every direction  
  
[Chorus:]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Run away my sister and brother  
Be afraid of love when the lover  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Tries to read the book by the cover  
Wrapped up in the arms of another  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Cover up prolonging the yearning  
Just ahead the fires are burning VERSE 2  
Swim for shore the tides are now turning  
Love the ones you love with your learning  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
  
Look ahead the futures depending  
On the brave to now start defending VERSE 3  
Tell the world the message you're sending  
We don't need an unhappy ending  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
Got to be safe if you want to be free BRIDGE  
To sit in the shade of the family tree  
  
[Verse 1:]  
Tries to read the book by the cover  
Wrapped up in the arms of another  
  
[Chorus]  
Don't give up  
For fear of rejection  
Stand your ground and voice an objection  
Got to be safe if you want to be free  
To sit in the shade of the family tree

Fe see me lift speaker - box you must fortunate  
Cause asdedance down me gone home me gone go hibernate  
Going home de other night me can't remember de date  
De early hours of de morning before people a wake  
  
Bopsing down de road it was me worst mistake  
Police come draw down pon me an a investigate  
Him say "Hey son where you coming from don't you know that it's late  
I've heard about you niggers and the trouble you create"  
I said "I'm coming from a party and me going home straight  
Me just stop a de shop to buy some cigarette an chocolate"  
When me explain de situation him stop interrogate  
Turn around jump in a I'm panda car an say "See you mate"

Or me could a end up visiting de damn magistrate

Nem ya Linda lyrics you must penetrate  
So listen every word I man and quotate

Dem say "Jerry your so good looking can I have you portrait"  
I say "Yes of course my darling but you know you have to wait"  
  
Well dais a something I man have to state  
A trollop is a woman with a whole heap a weight  
Don't tell her to her face cause she will aggravate  
And if she sit down pon you you will suffocate  
  
At de mile is 'nough excitement I Jerry create  
And you know that its not hard for me to exterminate  
Any boy way come a dance an a duplicate  
A style him get off a Saxon or a old yard tape

An 'nough people dem a say don't me impertinent  
Any gal way me like we must be intimate  
But me only make love when me in private

You tell me there's no darkness  
While the sun shines down on you  
And just because your life is peaceful  
There's no fighting left to do  
For every cup that runneth over  
Many more are filled with pain  
You talk to me of sunshine  
When it's pouring down with rain  
  
Just because you can't see it  
Doesn't mean it isn't there  
Just because it can't touch you  
Doesn't mean you shouldn't care  
For every life that's lit with love  
Many more are racked with pain  
You talk to me of sunshine  
When it's pouring down with rain  
  
  
(CHORUS)  
  
It's a long black night, good people  
Descended on our land  
Share your light  
Make a flower grow  
In the desert sand

I think its only fair to say  
We'd welcome riches down our way  
No stigma knotted in my hair  
I want to be a millionaire  
  
Nevertheless I must insist  
A thought is spared for those who missed  
The handouts when it came to wealth  
To education and good health  
  
The time has come now all can see  
As seeing this is killing me  
Our future victim to command  
Together we can lend a hand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So don't blame me for wanting more  
The facts are too hard too ignore  
I'm scared to death of poverty  
I only want what's best for me  
  
But even so I'm holding on  
I think the world can live as one  
If only credence took the lead  
The world would see a world to feed  
  
An endless sea of blood that's spilt  
Enough to sail an ark of guilt  
And when we lend our helping hand  
We'll have our green and pleasant land

Why do I have to dream of you when I don't want to dream a lie?  
Why do I have to dream of you when I don't want to dream a lie?  
  
There never was a better time  
For trying to set the words to rhyme  
Of when a golden love turns blue  
And dreams of dreams that won't come true  
  
Every night I call your name  
We're still together just the same  
  
A lonely room, an empty bed  
It always seems that way

Drop on by when the sun goes down  
We can talk or just hang around  
Shoot the breeze, tell me what you found  
On your search for some common ground  
  
Think of me when the moon is high  
Counting stars in the clear night sky  
Think of me when the moon is blue  
Sitting here just thinking of you  
  
I've been here and I've been there  
It's the same most everywhere  
We're all trying to get away  
Live to fight another day  
  
In my dreams I will follow you  
Any place that you want me to  
Tomorrow waits on the other side  
Patiently for the sun to rise  
Don't go now can't you stay a while  
Light my night with your loving smile  
Once you were gone but now your home  
I couldn't bear being all alone  
  
I've been here and I've been there  
It's the same most everywhere  
  
I've been here and I've been there  
It's the same most everywhere  
We're all trying to get away  
Live to fight another day [2x]

end)

Everything is better now  
Better than is was before  
Sunshine on a golden bough  
Darkness locked behind closed door  
Now I found a better place  
Somewhere I can lay my head  
Clean fresh air and open space  
Safe upon my feather bed  
  
I've been a mistake maker  
For all of my days  
And a law breaker  
But crime never pays  
An overtaker  
On lifes highways  
A serial faker  
Making getaways  
  
I've been a mover and a groover  
In the halls of power  
A real bad loser  
In my darkest hour  
A high seas cruiser  
Searching tropical flowers  
A pick and chooser  
In an ivory tower  
  
Now I'm a man of peace  
With a hungry soul  
For I found release  
In a lost loophole  
I'm the masterpiece  
Who just scored the goal  
Let the love increase  
Now I'm in control

In a little while Verse One  
I'll be on my way  
Got no words to express  
What I need to say  
  
[Chorus]  
Everytime I think about the first time Chorus  
We said hello  
You know when you know  
You never let go  
  
It's just not my style Verse Two  
Something I can't do  
After all this time  
I'm scared of losing you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Is there anything Verse Three  
You could let me know  
Surely you could find me  
A reason not to go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
After everything Verse Four  
We've been going through  
I'm so up and down  
So dizzy and blue  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let me one more time Verse Five  
Look into your eyes  
I remember when  
There were no goodbyes  
  
[Chorus]

Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.  
Barren is her bosom, empty as her eyes,  
Death a certain harvest scattered from the skies.  
  
Skin and bones is creeping, doesn't know he's dead.  
Ancient eyes are peeping, from his infant head.  
Politicians argue sharpening their knives.  
Drawing up their Bargains, trading baby lives.  
  
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.  
  
Hear the bells are ringing, Christmas on it's way.  
Hear the angels singing, what is that they say?  
Eat and drink rejoicing, joy is here to stay.  
Jesus son of Mary is born again today.  
  
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.  
Ivory Madonna dying in the dust,  
Waiting for the manna coming from the west.

Why do you have to force yourself with power and control  
Why do you have to live your life playing up a role  
Intimidating people with your wall of sight and sound  
You and your kind destroy our underground  
  
All the happiness you destroy  
All the brutal tactics that you always employ  
All the fucking bullshit when will it ever stop  
The comparison is obvious, you're a fucking cop  
Officer, you act like an animal, you're out of control  
  
Officer, what the hell is wrong with you  
Wear a tie if you want to wear a uniform  
Join the army if you want to conform  
Tough guy asshole do what you can  
Whatever you destroy we'll create it again

I don't know how many stars there are  
Up in the heavenly sky  
I only know my heaven is here on earth  
Each time you look into my eyes  
The way you do baby  
Thank you, thank you baby  
  
My beautiful bird, you have flown away  
I held you too tight  
I can see  
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby  
'Cause  
  
You are the book that I read each day  
You are the song that I sing  
(Gonna sing it to you)  
You are the 4 seasons of my life  
But maybe tomorrow  
You'll change your mind girl  
Maybe tomorrow  
You'll come back to my arms girl  
  
You're all I need to get by  
No one else can make me cry  
The way you do baby

When the dancehall jus' ram, some people call it confinement  
But if you're with your woman or your man, it's pure excitement  
When you see the girls groove, they get right in the mood for loving  
And if the weedman in the place, there's no time for pushing and shoving  
  
You see the DJ on the scene, he knows just what you mean about rubbing  
And when you're feeling alright, he's right out of sight while he's dubbing  
  
Well the dancehall jus' ram, so you see we're dealing with pure niceness  
And the music so loud that to shout above it, you'd be left voiceless  
  
The music so right  
We could have danced all night  
The feeling so nice  
Operator play it twice  
  
They have the reggae and soul and the ital vital dub plate riddims  
They have revival 45, calypso, soca, and all kind'a riddim  
  
You see the busy barman in the dance, he's used to dealing under nuff pressure  
And after you've had your drink, you're gonna need another refresher  
  
Everybody in the dance just grooving, looking laughing and smiling you see  
So if you're feeling irie little darling come and have a dance over by me

I'm gonna tell my friends about you  
Tell them about the things that you do to me  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're everything that's good so good to me  
I want to be always close to you  
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need  
I want to be always close to you  
Don't have to try you out for size  
You fit my heart so comfortable and warm  
The only one I have no doubt no fear about  
Without you what would my life be  
I want to be always close to you  
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need  
I want to be always so close to you  
I want to be always close to you  
To give a helping hand if ever you're in need  
I want to be always close to you  
Don't have to try you out for size  
You fit my heart so comfortable and warm  
The only one I have no doubt no fear about  
Without you what would my life be  
Without you what would my life be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be  
Tell them you're my best girl and best you'll always be

Give me all you have (Come over)  
All you got to give (Come over)  
Save your guilt till tomorrow (Come over)  
Won't be that hard to live with  
Satisfy my need (Come over)  
Won't be that easy (Come over)  
You gonna have to try a little harder baby (Come over)  
A little harder please me  
  
Why tell me no (Come over)  
When what you mean is yeah yeah (Come over)  
You'll have to tell me what you want to do 'cause (Come over)  
You Can't expect me to guess  
Last verse repeats  
My way of thinking

I will never let you go  
I will never  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
I've got to hold on, every day  
In every way, but the things you will say  
Just couldn't be that way  
You'll never, ever reach  
If you don't try  
Instead you keep on telling all  
Those dreadful lies  
Just wait and see  
How things could be  
When I am free  
Don't worry 'bout me  
Don't worry 'bout me 'cus  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
I will never let you go  
I will never  
(repeat chorus)  
I've got to hold on, every day  
In every way, but the things you will say  
Just couldn't be that way  
You'll never, ever reach  
If you don't try  
Instead you keep on telling all  
Those dreadful lies  
Just wait and see  
How things could be  
When I am free  
Don't worry 'bout me  
Don't worry 'bout me 'cus  
I've never let you go  
I'll always try  
And I've got so much soul  
You'll wonder why  
It's just because  
I'm so true  
You'll be feeling blue  
When I get through  
There is nothing you can do  
(repeat last verse)

When I'm with you I'm valuable  
Original and fashionable  
I'm totally formidable  
When I'm with you  
  
When you're with me invincible  
I'm bullet-proof unsinkable  
A one off individual  
That's why you're with me  
  
When I caught you unmissable  
So lovable and kissable  
Completely irresistible  
That's why I caught you  
  
Without you I am miserable  
Unconfortable in principle  
I think that we're inseparable  
I'm nothing without you  
  
Now you got me reliable  
Flexible and pliable  
You see its undeniable  
That's where you got me  
  
I'm nothing without you  
A man without a goal  
The last one waiting  
A lost and lonely soul

Now and then  
I must admit I wonder if I had the chance  
To vanquish foes with nothing more than just a glance  
How perfect every single day would be  
  
To never wait in driving rain  
For the bus that never came  
Not to be the one to blame  
For anybody else's misery  
  
Now and then  
I contemplate a different way around this day  
With nothing more than simple words, so I can say  
I'm quite content and happy being me  
  
Walking tall with peace of mind  
To leave no childhood dreams behind  
Arriving home to always find  
Things just as I know they ought to be  
  
Now and then  
I must admit I wonder if I had the chance  
To vanquish foes with nothing more than just a glance  
How perfect every single day would be  
To never wait in driving rain  
For the bus that never came  
Not to be the one to blame  
For anybody else's misery  
  
Now and then  
I wake up, when it hits me like a ton of bricks  
I realize it's me who has to take the licks  
No angels up there looking after me  
No rainbow with a pot of gold  
No cloak to shield me from the cold  
No pill to stop me growing old  
Dreams fading into stark reality

Oracabessa moonshine  
Is washing over me  
The Jacaranda tree  
And bathing in the sea  
Oracabessa sun up  
Will chase the night away  
Across the Lada bay  
And back to yesterday  
A warm Blue Mountain raincloud, welcomed by the land  
Made the morning cooler, left a rainbow in the sand  
Sweet Hibiscus lingers in my own backyard  
With a million different colors of a Hummingbird  
  
Orocabessa sunshine  
Is washing over me  
The Jacaranda tree  
And bathing in the sea  
Oracabessa sun up  
Will chase the night away  
Across the Lada bay  
And back to yesterday  
  
The Firefly's romance ignites the evening shade  
Makes the twilight dance a moonlight serenade  
The smoke sends out a signal above the golden sea  
Another day in Ladda Bay is waiting there for me  
  
Oracabessa moonshine  
Is washing over me  
The Jacaranda tree  
And bathing in the sea  
Oracabessa sun up  
Will chase the night away  
Across the Lada bay  
And back to yesterday

Please Don't Make Me Cry  
You say you are going to leave me  
I'm begging you to stay  
My baby I can't get through any way  
No I can't  
And when I wake up in the morning  
You are gone  
Little pretty thing  
You know I'll be all alone  
  
Chorus  
You'll hear me crying (mmmmmmm)  
Please don't make me cry (mmm mmmm)  
'cos I can't say good-bye (mmmmm)  
Please don't make me cry  
Because I know  
There will be nothing left for me  
  
All them good good times  
We spent together  
You said it was me and no other (yeah)  
And now you want to make me pain inside  
Darlin' I Know you are going to make me cry  
  
Chorus  
You'll hear me ..... etc  
All this pain I can't stand it  
You're going to leave  
You're going to leave this poor man on his own  
Yes you are (mmmmm)  
  
Chorus  
You'll hear me ..... etc  
All this pain I can't stand it  
You're going to leave  
You're going to leave this poor man on his own  
Yes you are  
Please don't make me cry  
Baby I'm Pleading

All the sorrow and the pain  
All the sacrifice in vain  
I was much too blind to see  
You make a loser out of me  
You put me down for oh so long  
While you sang your serpent's song  
  
[Chorus]  
The rest is history  
You can do no more to me  
I've been down so low  
Had nowhere left to go  
I could see it in your eyes  
All your promises were lies  
Promises and lies  
  
Your cut was quick and deep  
But then you thought you'd never need a friend  
But all things change, and tides must turn  
And you let all your bridges burn  
Too many fatal wounds to heal  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
There's a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna do?  
There's a rat in me kitchen what am I gonna go?  
I'm gonna fix that rat that's what I'm gonna do,  
I'm gonna fix that rat.  
  
When you open your mouth you don't talk, you shout  
And you give every body the blame,  
But when they catch you up,  
They will shut you up  
And you got no one to blame  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a rat in me kitchen  
  
When you out on the street,  
You practice lies and deceit  
And you scandalize my name  
But when I catch you up  
I'm gonna pull you up  
I'm gonna check-out inside your brain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
When yo deh pon the scene,  
You make everyone scream  
Because they know your so unjust  
But when they catch you up  
They will kick you up  
Because you someone they cannot trust  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You invade my space  
Make me feel disgraced  
And you just don't give a damn  
If I had my way  
If I had my say  
I'd like to see you hang  
  
[Chorus]

Red, red wine goes to my head,  
Makes me forget that I still need her so  
  
Red, red wine, it's up to you  
All I can do I've done  
Memories won't go, memories won't go  
  
Life is fine every time,  
Thoughts of you leave my head  
I was wrong, now I find  
Just one thing makes me forget  
  
Red, red wine, stay close to me  
Don't let me be alone  
It's tearing apart my blue heart  
  
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine,  
You keep me rockin' all of the time  
Red red wine, you make me feel so grand,  
I feel a million dollar when you're just in my hand  
Red red wine, you make me feel so sad,  
Any time I see you go, it make me feel bad  
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine,  
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline  
  
Red red wine, you give me holy pahzing  
Holy pahzing, you make me do my own thing  
Red red wine, you give me not awful love  
Your kind of lovin' like a blessing from above  
Red red wine, I loved you right from the start,  
Right from the start, and with all of my heart  
Red red wine in an eighties style  
Red red wine in a modern beat style  
Yeah  
  
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind  
Give me a little time, let me clear out my mind  
Give me red wine, the kind make me feel fine  
You make me feel fine all of the time  
Red red wine, you make me feel so fine  
Monkey back and ease up on the sweet deadline  
The line broke, the money get choked,  
Bunbah, ganjapani, little rubber boat  
Red red wine, I'm gonna hold on to you,  
Hold on to you 'cause I know you love truth  
Red red wine, I'm gonna love you till I die,  
Love you till I die, and that's no lie  
Red red wine, can't get your off my mind  
Wherever you may be, I'll surely find,  
I'll surely find. Make no fuss, just leave us

I said we friendship come first, the band did come second  
And that's why I decided to put it in a song  
So listen crowd of people and throw up unnu hands  
If you love dem their style and you love dem pattern

So give us what we want and mek we gwan

And that there love that could a never end

Like the seasons you change your mind  
It seems like loving you is a crime.  
  
I remember those days  
Oh, so long ago  
Like the first time I took you  
To a picture show  
Or the first time I kissed you  
Beneath the moonlit sky  
I put my hand on my heart  
I thought I'd die  
Like the seasons  
  
Yes, you were for me  
It was plain to see  
I knew in my heart  
  
You were the one for me  
Though people used to try  
To get us down  
As time goes on  
We're still around  
Like the seasons  
  
We had our share  
Of ups and downs  
We had our share  
Of nights on the town  
The days were short  
But the nights were long  
My love for you  
It grew so strong  
Like the seasons  
  
But as we grew old  
Your love turned cold  
Gone are the days  
Of glitter and gold  
I work so hard  
To keep you mine  
Now all I have is  
Nothing but time  
  
Like the seasons you change your mind  
It seems like loving you is a crime.

The neon haze of city lights  
The tribal sound of marching feet  
Cuts through the gloom on cold dark nights  
The tired and homeless roam the streets  
The sirens wail the engines roar  
A shadowed man just glances around  
A victim of life's mindless toil  
Lies cold and helpless on the ground  
  
The window dummies silent stare  
Bear witness on the nights  
If they could move  
What it would proved  
To see them all take flight  
  
The neon haze of city lights  
The tribal sound of marching feet  
Cuts through the gloom on cold dark nights  
The tired and homeless roam the streets  
The walls shout loud with angry words  
The people air their views  
The poor can scream but no-one hears  
The concrete jungle sings the blues

Since I met you lady  
My whole life has changed  
Since I met you lady  
My whole life has changed  
And everybody tells me  
That I am not the same  
  
I don't need nobody  
To tell my troubles to  
I don't need nobody  
To tell my troubles to  
Since I met you baby  
All I need is you  
  
Since I met you lady  
I'm a happy man  
Since I met you lady  
I'm a happy man  
I'm going to try and please you  
In everyway I can

The great flood of tears that we've cried  
For our brothers and sisters who've died  
Over four hundred years  
Has washed away our fears  
And strengthened our pride  
Now we turn back the tide  
  
We will no longer hear your command  
We will seize the control from your hand  
We will fan the flame  
Of our anger and pain  
And you'll feel the shame  
For what you do in gods name  
  
[Chorus]  
We will fight for the right to be free  
We will build our own society  
And we will sing, we will sing  
We will sing our own song  
  
When the ancient drum rhythms ring  
The voice of our forefathers sings  
Forward Africa run  
Our day of freedom has come  
For me and for you  
Amandla Awethu  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We will fight for the right to be free  
We will build our own society  
And we will sing, we will sing  
We will sing our own song

Singer man sing me a song  
Singer man sing me a song  
Singer man sing me a song  
  
Do you want soul?  
Do you want soul?  
Do you want soul?  
  
I hear you singing - sing a morning  
I hear you singing - sing a morning  
I hear you singing - sing a morning  
  
Do you really want soul?  
Do you really want soul?  
Do you really want soul?  
  
Singer man sing me a song  
Singer man sing me a song  
Singer man sing me a song  
  
Do you really want soul?  
Do you really want soul?  
Do you really want soul?  
  
I hear you singing - sing a morning

Once upon a time, not so long ago  
When things were much much simple  
And time would travel slow  
  
There came a righteous stranger  
With a bible in his hand  
To educate the sinner  
And liberate the land  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
The sins of the fathers  
Have visited from old  
In a never ending circle  
Of people bought and sold  
So the wretched of the earth  
Would huddle from the cold  
As a ship of fools go sailing  
On an Ocean black as gold  
  
So come and sit beside me  
And let my tale unfold  
In a land on milk and honey  
Where the truth must not be told  
As men of right and reason  
Let the devil take their soul  
For greed and fame and fortune  
And a river black as gold  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And all the non believers  
Where hiding from the light  
As a thousand burning crosses  
Were scattered in the night  
The thieves and the vagabonds  
Were sinking in the sand  
As a righteous lord and master  
Stretches out a helping hand  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And those who had to suffer  
The sick the young the old  
Where sacrifice to fortune  
And left out in the cold  
So with this new arrangement  
The leaders sold their souls  
For bangles, beads and baubles  
And a river black as gold  
  
[Chorus x2]

Baby girl the two of we have to get together  

It's so destructive  
Counter productive  
How we gonna make it  
When we do not know where love lives [2x]  
  
I'm not seeing what you're saying  
All the games that you are playing  
Look like tactics for delaying  
While we're on our knees and praying  
Making and breaking  
Sitting and debating  
The art of speculating  
Then accumulating  
  
I'm not buying what you're selling  
All your shouting and a yelling  
And the lies that you are telling  
Don't strike me as compelling  
Picking and choosing  
Winning and losing  
Cutting and bruising  
Using and abusing  
  
I'm not taking what you're giving  
The elections you are rigging  
From your penthouse living  
The deals that you are fixing  
Creeping and crawling  
Running and falling  
Stopping and stalling  
Crying and bawling

Seven on a Monday morning.  
And it's a sunny day.  
It's just too hot to be working  
But you've got to pay your way.  
  
So here I am sitting at the bus stop  
Wishing I was somewhere else  
Where I didn't have to work my rocks off  
Wishing I could please myself.  
  
Ten hours a day I'm grafting  
Under the bosses eye,  
Earn just enough to keep going,  
Making cars I'll never buy.  
  
So here I am sitting...  
Five days a week I'm giving,  
My time is clocking on.  
Just two days left for living,  
Wondering where my life has gone.  
  
So here I am sitting...

There must be some place we can go  
There must be someone that you know  
Where can I go, and who you know worries me,  
Oh Lord  
  
Where can I find someone like you, to love  
Where can I find someone like you, my love  
There must be something we can try  
There must be some things we can find  
  
What can I try, and how to get by worries me,  
Oh Lord  
Where can I find someone like you, to love  
Where can I find someone like you, oh my love

I'm a rebel, soul rebel  
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer  
See the morning sun, on the hillside  
Not living good, yeah  
You better travel wide  
You better travel wide  
Said I'm a living man  
I've got work to do  
If you're not happy, children  
Then you must be blue  
I said, you must be blue  
I'm a rebel, soul rebel  
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer  
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning time  
soul rebel  
I'm a capturer  
Soul adventurer  
See the morning sun, on the hillside  
Not living good, yeah  
You better travel wide  
You better travel wide  
Said I'm a living man  
I've got work to do  
If you're not happy, children  
Then you must be blue  
I said, you must be blue  
I'm a rebel, rebel in the morning time  
soul rebel  
I'm a capturer  
Soul adventurer  
I'm a rebel, soul rebel  
I'm a capturer, soul adventurer

UB40 - Sparkle Of My Eyes  
Many a girl has caught my eye, Verse 1  
Many a girl and that ain't no lie.

So beautiful with no effort at all.

I've got to find sweet cherry  
She's gone away from home  
I've got to find sweet cherry  
She's left me all alone  
(chorus)  
Cherry, cherry,  
Don't go and leave me alone  
Don't go and leave me alone  
  
My thoughts are always with you  
The emptiness leaves me blue  
If you should ever desert me  
Then life deserts me too  
  
(chorus)  
Cherry, cherry,  
Don't go and leave me alone  
Don't go and leave me alone  
  
When we were together, downtown  
We would do things together, downtown  
The first place I met you, downtown  
There we could always be.  
  
(chorus)  
Cherry, cherry,  
Don't go and leave me alone  
Don't go and leave me alone  

I can feel those thrill's walking over  
When you hold me tight  
Now I feel those pains taking over  
When you say goodnight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Oh what sweet sensation  
Lord what strange emotion  
You've got love and devotion  
And I won't forget your touch  
  
Now there's nothing left for me to say girl  
But stay in your world  
You've got so much soul deep inside girl  
And love that's richer than gold  
  
[Chorus]

Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.  
  
I've done everything one man can do, girl  
Said every word one man can say  
The thing that we had has gone astray, girl  
I'm missing you from day to day.  
  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.  
  
I've done everything one man can do, girl  
Said every word one man can say  
The thing that we had has gone astray, girl  
I'm missing you from day to day.  
  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.  
  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.  
  
Tears from my eyes keep on falling  
cause you are leaving, leaving with another  
Things that we've done together  
I'll always remember though you're with another, baby.

Tenderly she smiles  
Forgiving my mistakes  
Getting her to love me  
Was my biggest break  
Every place I go, she's inside of me  
Giving up her love unconditionally  
She shines the sun  
She pours the rain  
She touches me in places that I can't explain  
She's got a powerful hold on me  
The kind of hold from which I'd never struggle free  
  
Tell me what you know  
Tell me is it true  
Do you really love me just like I love you  
Everything I say  
Everything I do  
It's purely 'cause' I'm aiming to get hold of you  
  
People tell her she could do better than me  
She wouldn't necessarily agree  
We've got a thing going on you see  
The two of us together for eternity  
  
Tenderly she smiles  
Forgiving my mistakes  
Getting her to love me  
Was my biggest break  
Every place I go, she's inside of me  
Giving up her love unconditionally  
  
Tenderly she smiles  
Forgiving my mistakes  
Getting her to love me  
Was my biggest break  
Every place I go, she's inside of me  
Giving up her love unconditionally  
  
She shines the sun  
She pours the rain  
She touches me in places that I can't explain  
She's got a powerful hold on me  
The kind of hold from which I'd never struggle free  
  
Tell me what you know  
Tell me is it true  
Do you really love me just like I love you  
Everything I say  
Everything I do  
It's purely 'cause' I'm aiming to get hold of you  
  
People tell her she could do better than me  
She wouldn't necessarily agree  
We've got a thing going on you see  
The two of us together for eternity  
  
Tenderly she smiles  
Forgiving my mistakes  
Getting her to love me  
Was my biggest break  
Every place I go, she's inside of me  
Giving up her love unconditionally

A warm dry wind is all that breaks the silence,  
The highways quiet scars across the land.  
People lie, eyes closed, no longer dreaming,  
The earth dies screaming.  
Like scattered pebbles, cars lie silent waiting,  
Oil less engines seized by dirt and sand.  
Bodies hanging limp, no longer bleeding,  
The earth dies screaming.  
  
The earth dies screaming  
The earth dies screaming  
Your country needs you, lets strike up the band.  
  
The earth dies screaming  
The earth dies screaming  
Despite all odds we must defend our land.  
  
Half eaten meals lie rotting on the tables,  
Money clutched within a bony hand.  
Shutters down, the banks are not receiving,  
The earth dies screaming.

1st floor decide what you'll be one day  
With a head full of comment and nothing to say  
2nd floor mixed up it happens that way  
Soon you realize that listening don't pay  
3rd floor in limbo, no easy moves  
Up or down it's time to choose  
  
[Chorus]  
The elevators going up  
Quick the door's about to shut  
Too late we're full just hang around  
It won't be long - it won't be long before it's down  
  
4th floor the job hunt and all that you ask  
Is an honest day's pay for an honest day's graft  
5th floor you may make a little more money  
Now it's apparent downstairs ain't so fuuny  
6th floor a mortgage, a collar and tie  
2 weeks vacation in June or July  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The elevators going up  
Quick the door's about to shut ....  
  
7th floor expenses and private schools  
Pushing a pen you're not turning the tools  
8th floor position, respect and acclaim  
Move up the 9th for fortune or fame  
10th floor for investment and real estate  
Recouping the redies before it's tool late  
11th floor the penthouse the final cut  
With a head full of comment and a mouth that stays shut  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The elevators going up  
Quick the door's about to shut...

Now I know your secret  
I promise that I'll keep it  
So confidentially  
Between just you and me, I'll never leak it  
  
I'm the specialist  
I know you can't resist  
I'll bypass your alarm  
No need to twist my arm, I insist  
  
If you're looking for a war  
There's a market for betrayal  
Don't ask me what I saw  
Ya know my secrets not for sale  
Don't ask me what I heard  
Ya know I promised not to say  
I said I'd never breathe a word  
Until my dying day  
  
Well seeing is believing  
No use in your deceiving  
For now I know it's true  
It's you that holds the clue, I'll be leaving  
  
Now I've got to say goodbye  
You understand I have to fly  
When you get the third degree  
And the truth don't set you free, You've got to lie  
  
If you're looking for a war  
There's a market for betrayal  
Don't ask me what I saw  
Ya know my secrets not for sale  
Don't ask me what I heard  
Ya know I promised not to say  
I said I'd never breathe a word  
Until my dying day

Dais a de start and not the finish na go deal it with ace  
I like to ride up in the ridim wid de treble and the base  
Not a courtroom could a hold me cause they wouldn't have a case  
  
So don't you hurry don't rush me no in a no haste  
Me na go chat dais one fast ca a no race me a race  
Cas Sis V de pan de mike I beg you keep up the pace  
And who a star wid Mr T it's Hannibal, Murdock and face  
I'm sure you noticed on the mike that I am in the right place  
  
I'm gonna chat it in a style and chat it in a grace  
Eat good food drink good you know that's to my taste  
Now make sure eat it drink it all off na make none go to waste  
And who's aeoberti upon Falcon Crest you know him a chase  
  
Se that the top of the crew Sis V I may seem  
See that me deal wid realism get guided by all my dream  
Now raspberry ripple as you know it is my favorite ice-cream  
  
So when me step in a de dance in my gear I just gleam  
I am the top mile women that's why I'm standing so keen  
Don't wa fe hear no pirate chat ca dem no in a my team  
Se dat me de pan level vibes so chatting this I'm the queen  
  
Why don't you shake a leg why don't you rock and come in  
Don't bother fight in a de dance don't want police an the scene  
To sparkle all the polishing you'll have to use Mr Sheen  
Incredible Hulk transformation gigantic and green  
  
So when you look in a him face he stares at you really mean  
I like to eat up my steak better make sure it lean  
Just add some rice add some dumplin' but leave out the bean  
Me na go to restaurant sit down and eat three course meal  
Me a chat it verbally don't want it signed stampedor sealed  
  
In a de old avengers starred steed and Mrs Peel  
Who Robbie Box that gambler on the programme Big Deal  
This one is live and direct so you know it's for real  
I don't respect dais ya system don't expect me to kneel  
Cause Jesus Christ worked his miracle many man ham did heal  
  
Ca man dem make out a flesh and robots made our of steel  
They might can operate like man unlike man they can't feel  
Don't bother mix with no informer cause on you they might squeal  
  
Cas me se when you have a spliff you must kark it  
And when you have a dog you must walk it  
Cause it might just do a number two upon your carpet  
You have to get down on your knee and begin to clean it  
Well in a de white house Mr Reagen a sit  
And when me go a nasa dema launch rocket  
  
So when a got a needle save myself nine stitch  
While Joan Collins she's starring as the super bitch  
Now I'm not exactly poor but I'm certainly ain't rich  
I'm gonna preach it right don't bother call me hypercrit  
  
Don't want hear Tony Butler me no check fe critic  
Ca when I get a curly perm Jahman just use a home kit  
And if I'm forced to hear a pirate dash dem down a snake pit  
  
Mak pirina knam dem tear them flesh bit by bit  
Ca sister de pan de mile and I have got nough lyric  
Jim Davidson teasing Plice with his catch phrase nick nich  
Upon my wrist I wear a watch how does it go tock tick  
And who is starring with Magnum Higgins TC and Rick  
Ca Tony labour S-D-P Jahman dem all make me sick  
Because dem na go get my vote ca me no vote for politic  
A me a Sister V upon the mike coming through  
Se me a top a de chart Jahman and top of the crew

You try to close your ears  
And you try to close your eyes  
But the blasphemies keep coming  
Tempting you lies  
  
[Chorus]  
Give thanks for you protection  
Your watchdogs of the night  
Who hold the hungry wolves at bay  
And keep them out of sight, out of sight  
  
You just don't understand it  
But it strikes a distant chord  
So you look for away of escaping  
And sanity's restored  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give thanks for your protection  
Your  
  
  
You focus your direction  
Cloak tightly pulled around  
But somewhere in the distance  
You can hear a haunting sound  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give thanks for your protection  
Your  
  
You're in danger of corruption  
And you're always running scared  
You cannot make decisions  
You're completely unprepared  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Give thanks for your protection  
Your

Well certain thing you don't act man  
And you can't take it back  
You understand me a say,  
But certain things you have to look on an other thing,  
Hm..... , me can't understand what I say

Me not understand what we are chat about,  
Well this is what we chat about

Leaving tomorrow was what you had planned  
No point in pretending, I know that it's ending  
I just want to know where the ending began  
  
[Chorus:]  
Where did I go wrong to make it like this  
No warmth in your body, no touch in your kiss  
Holding you now, hurts more than it should  
If I let you go, girl, you'll be gone for good  
  
I thought you had saved me, the love that you gave me  
The sweetest loving in all of the land  
But you've taken my heart, and you've torn it apart  
And its crumbled to dust in the palm of your hand  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Where did I go wrong...(etc)  
There's nothin' worth sayin', I know you're not staying  
Might as well face it, it's out of my hand  
No point in pretending, I know that it's ending  
I just want to know where the ending began  
  
(chorus)  
Where did I go wrong........(etc)

Write off the debt  
Me say write off the debt  
Me say write off the debt  
And stop the third world a fret  
I say the I'm put on too much interest  
Certain man pon the streets can't even buy a little vest  
I said the east and the west them just a build up dem chest  
Certain man in the third world can't even digest, a little food  
But no bother take them man deh as no fool  
'cause' you know say dem teach and go a good school  
Me say lord a god a mercy dem learn up all the rules  
So no bother patronize dem 'cause all dem need is the tools  
Me say over the millennium me say what a bomb  
Me say a whole heap of right  
Me say a whole heap of wrong  
I say it's time to come together and sing we own song  
And make the shooting and all the killing and the fighting  
Have fe done  
I say the im wipe off the lump sum  
You know say me bredren that would a handsome  
So come on fe me posse lets rehearse up this song  
And hope say dem man yah don't take too long  
Me say write off the debt  
Me say write off the debt  
And stop the third world a fret  
Picture a world with no more hurt and pain  
Picture a world where we are all the same  
Maybe not in mind but in spirit  
Must do the right thing to ease the pain  
Yes me breden that would a wicked!

[Chorus]  
You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Life in the shadows ain't no fun  
  
It's easy getting up there  
Never think of coming down  
Not hard to say 'I want you'  
When you're floating on a cloud  
But you know that lonely feeling  
When nothing's going right  
'Cause it's only the beginning  
Of a cold and sleepless night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run  
  
It's harder getting up there  
And it's painful coming down  
And now you can't see clearly  
Beneath the thunder cloud  
And the loneliness gets longer  
When nothing's going right  
And things ain't getting any better  
With another sleepless night  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You could meet somebody, you never know  
From brief encounters habits grow  
Into giant oaks that hide the sun  
Your only chance is to turn and run

Oh doctor help me please  
I'm dying, crippled with disease  
My Body's aching limb to limb  
My bones are glowing through my skin  
When I look up into black skies  
Mushrooms grow before my eyes  
Doctor save me if you can  
I'm a desperate man  
I'm a desperate man  
  
As he lay thinking he was dead  
A burning pain short through his head  
He looked into those tired old eyes  
Heard forty years of anguished cries  
And this doctor said  
  
Your eyes were open  
But you shut them with your mouth  
You always heard  
But you weren't doing the screaming  
You'd only just woken  
But Already, you'd forgotten,  
What you were dreaming  
  
Such a sad case  
The failure of a human race

We can drag you out of bed in the middle of the night  
Drive tanks along your street looking for a flight  
We can put you in a cell an dash away the key  
Make you stand against the wall torture chamber style  
The reason is simple, it's obvious to see  
We can shoot at you but you can't kill we  
Don't you see, don't you see, your not an army  
  
The reason is simple, it's obvious to see  
Right is on your side but the media's with we  
Don't you see, don't you see, your not an army  
  
The thing you must remember since these troubles first began  
Were supported by a tax paying population  
And if the rest of this world is against we  
It's a fact that the people of this country won't see  
  
They can give you a trial by military  
But you won't be sentenced politically  
You'll be beat by other prisoners for political views  
But you just another killer when we read it in the news
