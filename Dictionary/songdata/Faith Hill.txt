Her momma's still got that sequin gown that she wore in '68  
She taught her early how to smile that smile and wave from the parade  
It took a whole lot of years and tears  
For her momma to finally admit  
No matter how many stitches and pins  
That old dress was never gonna fit  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"  
  
Her daddy used to say, "You'll make a lovely bride someday  
He'll ride up on big white horse and just carry you away"  
It took twenty-five years and some broken vows  
Before they'd finally see  
There's a little more to love and life  
Then fairy tales and hand me down dreams  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"  
  
Now she's got twenty-seven candles on her cake  
And she means to make her life her own  
Before there's twenty-eight  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"  
  
She was daddy's little girl  
Momma's little angel  
Teacher's pet, pageant queen  
She said "All my life I've been pleasin' everyone but me,  
Living someone else's dream"

So much pain and no good reason why  
You cried until the tears run dry  
Nothing else can make you understand  
The one thing that you held so dear  
Is slipping from your hand  
  
And you say  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
And why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
  
Somewhere down the road  
There'll be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
And somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
And they will have the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
Yesterday I thought I'd seen it all  
I thought I'd climbed the highest wall  
But now I see that learning never ends  
And all I know to do is keep on walking  
'Round the bend  
  
Singing  
Why, why, why  
Does it go this way  
Why, why, why  
And all I can say is  
  
Somewhere down the road  
There'll be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
And somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
And they will hold the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
Somewhere, somewhere down  
And somewhere down the road  
There'll be answers to the questions  
Somewhere down the road  
Though we cannot see it now  
And somewhere down the road  
You will find mighty arms reaching for you  
They will have the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
They will have the answers  
At the end of the road  
  
Somewhere down the road, yeah  
Somewhere, somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere down the road  
Why, why, why  
There will be arms reaching, down the road  
Somewhere, somewhere, somewhere  
Oooh

'It's late enough  
All your kids should be home.'  
The policeman says  
As he takes your beer for his own  
  
You remember  
Wondering what his wife thought  
About his occupation  
He knows that you were just chasing a dream  
  
To the town line and back and over again  
So he winks at your girls  
And tells you all, 'I'll see you later.'  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now I'm begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Don't you know who I am?  
Don't you know who I am?  
Standing in your kitchen  
  
It's late enough  
Your husband's dinner is cold  
So you wrap it up and leave it for him on the stove  
It's probably the traffic again  
  
Another important meeting  
You haven't talked to an adult all day  
Except for your neighbor who drives you crazy  
When he finally gets in  
He's sure not in the mood for talkin'  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now I'm begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Don't you know who I am?  
Don't you know who I am?  
I'm standing in your kitchen  
  
And hours become days  
Days become years  
And you could burn down this town  
If they made matches from fear  
'Cause you're no worse off than anybody else  
Hey, don't you even know?  
Don't you even know yourself?  
  
So you're standing outside your high school doors  
The ones you walked through twenty years before  
And you whisper to all the girls  
'Run, run, oh, run.'  
  
I was stealing kisses from a boy  
Now I'm begging affection from a man  
In my house dress  
Don't you know who I am?  
Don't you know who I am?  
Take a look at who I am  
Take a look at who I am  
I'm stealing kisses  
Stealing kisses

This is the window to my heart  
I just want you to be free  
There ain't no freedom where we are  
Ain't no wishes in these stars  
  
Ain't no reason to believe  
But don't worry baby  
Don't you worry  
Maybe this is what we need  
  
A little bruising, a little bleeding  
Some space that we can breathe in  
Some silence in between  
  
[Chorus]  
So cry for me baby, and I'll cry for you  
And we'll both break down and we'll both break through  
We'll find our way and we'll face the truth  
We both will be stronger  
And we'll lie down in our loneliness  
And wake up with our sad regrets  
Even though we don't know it yet  
We both will be stronger  
We both will be stronger  
  
I can't believe you're really gone now  
But I know it's for the best  
And I know that we weren't right  
But I still reach for you each night  
And man that hurts like hell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So Baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
This is the window to my heart  
I just want us to be free  
Baby I'm sorry for the way things are  
Goodbye is always hard  
And we both will be stronger

We've got barefoot ladies  
And tricked out Mercedes'  
People getting crazy on the boulevard  
We've got classic colas and ice cold Coronas  
Big cool parties in the back yard  
  
I said "Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime"  
  
You'll see straw sombreros  
And T-top Camaros  
Stereos blastin' in the parking lot  
You'll see rock hard bodies and bikini hotties  
And everybody's got it goin' on  
They're showing what they got  
  
Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
  
I said, "Hey everybody  
Can't you feel the rhythm now?  
Hey everybody don't you wanna party?  
Hey everybody can't you feel the rhythm now?  
Hey everybody don't you wanna party?"  
  
Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends, blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
Hey that's the way we do it  
New friends and blue skies that never end  
Hey that's the way we like it  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
  
Good times, sunshine and summertime  
Good times, sunshine and summertime

Baby, don't turn out the light  
I want to see you look at me  
Whisper only truth tonight  
Not just promises and empty fantasies  
  
I don't need a bed of roses  
'Cause roses wither away  
All I really need is honesty  
From someone with a strong heart  
A gentle hand  
Who'll take me as I am  
  
Baby, I need for you to know  
Just exactly how I feel  
Fiery passions come and go  
I'd trade a million pretty words  
For one touch that is real  
  
I don't need a bed of roses  
'Cause roses wither away  
All I really need is honesty  
From someone with a strong heart  
A gentle hand  
Who'll take me as I am  
  
From someone with a strong heart  
A gentle hand  
Who'll take me as I am

I hear every word they say  
They tell me to stay away  
They say I'm better off without you, baby  
You've caused me nothing but pain  
  
Heartache's your middle name  
But seems I never see it coming  
I'll just admit it baby  
You really drive me crazy  
  
Let go of my heart  
'Cause every time you're near me  
I can't think clearly  
Defenses fall apart  
  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, baby, of my life  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
Someday baby, I will get it right  
  
I never will understand  
Why I let you think you can  
Treat me any way you please, baby  
I guess I hope someday  
  
You'll settle down and say  
Give me all the love I need, baby  
Time and time I've found  
You always let me down  
  
Always ends the same way  
You'd think that I could see the way you're treatin' me  
Won't ever change  
  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, baby, of my life  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
Someday baby, I will get it right  
  
If I could just hold on, if I could just be strong  
My heart would see it's wrong, lovin' you, lovin' you  
  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, baby, of my life  
I keep livin' and lovin' and learnin' the hard way  
Someday baby, I will get it right  
  
Livin' and lovin' the hard way  
You're the hardest lesson, oh baby, of my life  
Livin' and lovin' the hard way  
Someday, I will get it right

So hot outside all I can wear  
Is these cut off overalls  
And sandals on my feet.  
But I emptied my pockets for a bus ticket  
Just so I could sit there on a broken seat  
I got no place I should go  
I got no worries you know  
Second or seventh street,  
It doesn't matter to me.  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night, yeah  
I'm the lucky one.  
I'm the lucky one.  
  
Well I pulled back down to  
My upstreet apartment  
The air never works in that old place  
Twenty-seven I thought I'd  
Be further along  
Than just this rented space.  
I got no papers to read  
I got no cable TV  
And I got no places to be  
I got no people to meet  
  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night, yeah  
I'm the lucky one.  
I'm the lucky one.  
  
I'm on a roll  
When I'm with you  
Don't stop me now  
I just can't lose  
  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night  
  
'Cause you're mine  
That's all I need to know  
The sunshine's everywhere we go  
It's so right 'cause I've got you to hold  
Every night, yeah  
I'm the lucky one  
I'm the lucky one,  
Yeah I'm the lucky one  
I'm the lucky one

Couple of guys sittin' around drinkin'  
Down at the Starlight Bar  
One of 'em says, "You know I've been thinking"  
Other one says, "That won't get you too far"  
  
He says, "This is your life, and welcome to it  
It's just workin' and drinkin' and dreams  
Ad on TV says ?Just Do It'  
Hell if I know what that means"  
  
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee  
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball  
The secret of life is a beautiful woman  
And Marilyn stares down from the barroom wall  
  
"You and me, we're just a couple of zeros  
Just a couple of down-and-outs  
But movie stars and football heroes  
What have they got to be unhappy about?"  
  
So they turn to the bartender, "Sam, what do you think?  
What's the key that unlocks that door?"  
Sam don't say nothin', just wipes off the bar  
And he pours them a couple more  
  
'Cause the secret of life is in Sam's martinis  
The secret of life is in Marilyn's eyes  
The secret of life is in Monday Night Football  
Rolling Stones records and Mom's apple pie  
  
Sam looks up from his Sunday paper  
Says, "Boys, you're on the wrong track  
The secret of life is there ain't no secret  
And you don't get your money back"  
Hey  
  
The secret of life is gettin' up early  
The secret of life is stayin' up late  
The secret of life is try not to hurry  
But don't wait  
Don't wait  
  
The secret of life is a good cup of coffee  
The secret of life is keep your eye on the ball  
The secret of life is to find the right woman  
The secret of life is nothin' at all  
Oh, it's nothin' at all  
The secret of life  
  
Couple of guys sittin' around drinkin'  
Down at the Starlight Bar  
One of 'em says, "You know I've been thinking"  
Other one says, "That won't get you too far"  
"That won't get you too far"

If I could grant you one wish  
I'd wish you could see the way you kiss  
Ooh, I love watching you baby  
When you're driving me crazy  
  
Ooh, I love the way you  
Love the way you love me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
Ooo, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me  
I only wish that you could see the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
  
It's not right  
It's not fair  
What you're missing over there  
Someday I'll find a way to show you  
Just how lucky I am to know you  
  
Ooh, I love the way you  
Love the way you love me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
Ooo, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me  
I only wish that you could see the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
  
You're the million reasons why  
There's love reflecting in my eyes  
  
Ooh, I love the way you  
Love the way you love me  
There's nowhere else I'd rather be  
Ooo, to feel the way I feel with your arms around me  
I only wish that you could see the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
  
Ooh, the way you love me  
The way you love me  
Oh yeah  
  
The way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me  
Woh woh woh woh the way you love me

It's not easy trying to understand  
How the world can be so cold, stealing the souls of man  
Cloudy skies rain down on all your dreams  
You wrestle with the fear and doubt  
Sometimes it's hard but you gotta believe  
  
[Chorus]  
There's a better place, where our Father waits  
And every tear He'll wipe away  
The darkness will be gone,the weak shall be strong  
Hold on to your faith  
  
There will come a day, there will come a day  
Wars are raging, lives are scattered  
Innocence is lost, and hopes are shattered  
The old are forgotten, the children are forsaken  
In this world we're living in  
Is there anything sacred?  
  
There will come a day, there will come a day  
The song will ring out, down those golden streets  
The voices of earth with the angels will sing  
Every knee will bow, sin will have no trace  
  
In the glory of His amazing grace  
Every knee will bow, sin will have no trace  
In the glory of His amazing grace  
There will come a day, there will come a day  
  
Oooh there will come a day  
I know there's coming a day, coming a day

When I think back on these times  
And the dreams we left behind  
I'll be glad 'cause I was blessed to get to have you in my life  
  
When I look back on these days  
I'll look and see your face  
You were right there for me  
  
In my dreams I'll always see you soaring by the sky  
In my heart there'll always be a place for you  
For all my life  
I'll keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
  
Well you showed me how it feels  
To feel the sky within my reach  
And I always will remember all the strength you gave to me  
Your love made me make it through  
Oh I owe so much to you  
You were right there for me  
  
In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky  
In my heart there'll always be a place for you  
For all my life  
I'll keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
  
'Cause I always saw in you my light, my strength  
And I want to thank you now for all the ways  
You were right there for me  
(You were right there for me)  
You were right there for me  
For always  
  
In my dreams I'll always see you soar above the sky  
In my heart there'll always be a place for you  
For all my life  
  
I'll keep a part of you with me  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
And everywhere I am there you'll be  
There you'll be

Yeah, I have my addictions  
And keep my share of secrets  
And things you'll never see  
I get selfish and defensive  
And pay too much attention  
To my insecurities  
Oh I, I'm just like everybody else  
I try to love Jesus and myself  
  
I don't know what you believe  
Or what you think of what you see  
But this is a part of me  
What I do and who I am  
All of my impurities  
Are right here on my sleeve  
This is me  
This is me  
  
My heart breaks for the homeless  
I worry about my parents  
And all my bills are late  
I'm dealing with the changes  
This complicated strangeness  
Of seeing life this way  
I, I'm just like everybody else  
I try to love jesus and myself  
  
I don't know what you believe  
Or what you think of what you see  
But this is a part of me  
What I do and who I am  
All of my impurities  
Are right here on my sleeve  
This is me  
This is me  
  
I laugh at silly movies  
Tear up when I see babies  
And I'm stubborn as a stone  
I criticize my body  
I wonder if I'm ready  
To ever be alone  
Oh I, I'm just like everybody else  
I cry, just like everybody else...  
  
I don't know what you believe  
Or what you think of what you see  
But this is a part of me  
What I do and who I am  
All of my impurities  
Are right here on my sleeve  
This is me  
This is me

I don't want another heartbreak  
I don't need another turn to cry, no  
I don't want to learn the hard way  
Baby, hello, oh, no, goodbye  
But you got me like a rocket  
Shooting straight across the sky  
  
It's the way you love me  
It's a feeling like this  
It's centrifugal motion  
It's perpetual bliss  
It's that pivotal moment  
It's, ah, impossible  
This kiss, this kiss (unstoppable)  
This kiss, this kiss  
  
Cinderella said to Snow White  
How does love get so off course, oh  
All I wanted was a white knight  
With a good heart, soft touch, fast horse  
Ride me off into the sunset  
Baby, I'm forever yours  
  
It's the way you love me  
It's a feeling like this  
It's centrifugal motion  
It's perpetual bliss  
It's that pivotal moment  
It's, ah, unthinkable  
This kiss, this kiss (unsinkable)  
This kiss, this kiss  
  
You can kiss me in the moonlight  
On the rooftop under the sky, or  
You can kiss me with the windows open  
While the rain comes pouring inside  
Kiss me in sweet slow motion  
Let's let every thing slide  
You got me floating, you got me flying  
  
It's the way you love me  
It's a feeling like this  
It's centrifugal motion  
It's perpetual bliss  
It's that pivotal moment  
It's, ah, subliminal  
This kiss, this kiss (it's criminal)  
This kiss, this kiss  
  
It's the way you love me baby  
It's the way you love me darling, yeah  
It's the way you love me  
It's a feeling like this  
It's centrifugal motion  
It's perpetual bliss  
It's that pivotal moment  
It's, ah, subliminal  
This kiss, this kiss (it's criminal)  
This kiss, this kiss  
  
It's the way you love me baby  
It's the way you love me darling, yeah  
It's the way you love me  
It's a feeling like this

i'll need time to get you off my mind.  
and i may sometimes bother you,  
try to be in touch with you.  
even ask too much of you from time to time.  
now and then.  
lord, you know i'll need a friend.  
til i get used to losin you,  
let me keep on usin you til i can make it on my own.  
i'll get by, but no matter how i try.  
there'll be times you know i'll call  
chances are my tears will fall,  
and i'll have no pride at all from time to time.  
but they say there'll be brighter days.  
but til then i'll lean on you thats all i mean to do  
til i can make it on my own.  
surely someday i'll look up and see the mornin sun,  
without another lonely nite behind me.  
then i'll know i'm over you  
and all my cryin's done.  
no more hurt and memories can find me.  
but til then lord, you know i'm gonna need a friend.  
til i get used to losin you,  
let me keep on usin you til i can make it on my own,  
til i can make it on my own

Love  
So cruel  
Yeah that's all that I got from you  
Tell me what in the world could I do  
But leave  
After all that you've done to me  
Now it's so easy to say I'm over you  
  
[Chorus]  
'Cause Baby I cried a little too hard  
A little too long  
What I thought was right  
Was way too wrong  
And too far gone  
I can't bring back the love  
There just ain't enough  
Available  
Impossible  
Unsaveable  
  
Here  
You come  
Tryin' to make up for what you've done  
It's too late to say you're sorry now  
Now it's your turn  
For you can't cross that bridge you burned  
You're on you own when will you learn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Love  
There's someone out there for me  
Who thinks I'm beautiful  
I've got to go  
  
[Chorus]

What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping?  
  
[Chorus]  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him Lord  
The Babe, the Son of Mary  
  
So bring Him incense, gold, and myth  
Come peasant, king, to own Him  
The King of kings, salvation brings  
Let loving hearts enthrone Him  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Thought we had a good thing baby  
You pulled the wool over my eyes  
Should've seen it coming baby  
Now all I see is a cool love dying  
  
Honey I don't want to hold you down  
Why you gotta own the lock and the key  
Oh tell me baby  
Good things just don't come around  
  
And you can't have them for free  
No not me  
You've been a river of give  
And an ocean of take  
Darlin' for heaven's sake  
  
You've got me up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out, boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
You're living in your own world  
You act like I'm just passing through  
Oh yeah  
Don't you want to be happy  
  
Don't you know how good I could be  
Seems everybody's telling you something  
That they know you just want to hear  
Oh but you ain't gonna hear it from me  
  
You've been a valley of love  
And a mountain of need  
Baby, it's time you see  
  
You've got me up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out, boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
Up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
You've been a river of give and a mountain of take  
Darlin' for Heaven's sake  
  
You've got me up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out, boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
  
Up and down and in between  
Acting nice then being real mean  
Hey  
Well you hold me tight then you turn your back  
  
Who could deal with that  
You say you want to work it out boy  
Tell me what's in it for me  
Oh, in it for me  
  
What's in it for me  
What's in it for me

When the lights go down  
He'll be fillin' a pan with a broom in his hand  
In some dive across town  
He'll be wiping the bar, moppin' the floor  
Countin' his tips, lockin' the doors  
Wrestling the devil that tells him to pour another round  
  
When the lights go down  
She'll be callin' her friends from her Mercedes Benz  
But it's too late now  
They were there for the fame, the flash and the thrill  
For the drop of the name, the parties, the pills  
As another star falls form the Hollywoody Hills without a sound  
  
[Chorus]  
When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be  
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see  
When you feel that hole inside your soul  
And wonder what you're made of  
Well we all find out  
When the lights go down  
When the lights go down  
  
At the end of the day when this game that I play  
Has gone another round  
As I lay there alone on this big empty bed  
With nothing but thoughts of you in my head  
I think of the things that I wish I had said  
When you were still around  
  
When the lights go down and there's nothing left to be  
When the lights go down and the truth is all you see  
And I wonder if all my life's about the sum  
Of all my fear and all my doubts  
When the lights go down  
  
[Chorus]

Baby, I'll be there  
To lift you up  
I'll dry your eyes  
Oh, when you cry  
When you're alone  
And nobody's there to take you through the night  
Oh, when nothing's right  
Call out my name  
Oh, don't be ashamed to say you need a hand  
I understand, baby  
  
Sometimes the night can be so dark and cold  
No one beside you  
And no one to hold  
Hold on, hold on  
  
When you cry  
I will dry your eyes  
When you fall  
I'll lift you up high  
You just reach  
For these arms of mine  
I promise they won't let you go  
And I'll make you smile  
When you cry  
  
You're always strong  
Always got a hand to lend to someone else  
Don't need no one else  
What about those times  
When that heart inside is crying out for love  
For someone, baby  
  
Someone to lean on when the tears start to fall  
Lean on me I'll see you through it all  
Just hold on, hold on  
  
When you cry  
I will dry your eyes  
When you fall  
I'll lift you up high  
You just reach  
For these arms of mine  
I promise they won't let you go  
And I'll make you smile  
When you cry  
  
Hold on to me  
When you're not feeling strong  
Hold on, baby, hold on  
  
When you cry  
I will dry your eyes  
When you fall  
I'll lift you up high  
You just reach  
For these arms of mine, baby  
I promise they won't let you go  
When you cry  
  
When you cry  
When you cry  
Oh, baby  
Yeah

Where are you Christmas?  
Why can't I find you?  
Why have you gone away?  
  
Where is the laughter,  
You used to bring me?  
Why can't I hear music play?  
  
My world is changing  
I'm rearranging  
Does that mean Christmas changes too?  
  
Where are you Christmas?  
Do you remember,  
The one you used to know?  
  
I'm not the same one  
See what the time has done  
Is that why you have let me go?  
  
Christmas is here, everywhere  
Oh, oh  
Christmas is here, if you care  
Oh  
  
If there is love in your heart and your mind  
You will feel like Christmas all the time  
Oh  
  
I feel you Christmas  
I know I found you  
You never fade away  
Oh  
  
The joy of Christmas  
Stays here inside us  
Fills each and every heart  
With love  
  
Where are you Christmas?  
Fill your heart with love

Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Lightning flash and the flesh so warm  
In an arc of beauty busy being born  
Skin on skin and my heart is torn  
From the tour of duty  
Heaven is here and here's my home  
She is seated on the holy throne  
'Neath the cherub on the tread of dawn  
Unnerving beauty  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
You came alive in your pride  
You shiny diamond  
You cry like you lie  
There's no denying  
Yet to see you come in the crash of thunder  
But when I do I'll watch in wonder  
Wicked  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
One day comes and a baby born  
Another flies by and a mother mourns  
Soul come go in the dead of morn with the passing season  
Lose myself find me here with you  
Don't know where I've been don't know what to do  
Time stands still and my spirit's through and my soul it's freezing  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Your eyes line with the sun  
You hungry demon  
Uproot my belief cut down my reason  
Who or why or what there's no believing  
Everything you touch there's no leaving  
Wicked  
Wicked  
Wicked  
Wicked  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Out of my head  
In my head  
Lightning flash and the flesh so warm  
In arc of beauty busy being born  
Skin on skin and my heart is torn  
Wicked

They said change your clothes,  
She said no I won't,  
They said comb your hair,  
She said some kids don't,  
And her parents dreams went up in smoke.  
  
They said you can't leave,  
She said yes I will,  
They said don't see him,  
She said his name is Bill,  
She's on a roll and it's all uphill.  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
She's a wild one,  
Runnin' free.  
  
She loves rock and roll,  
They said it's satan's tongue,  
She thinks they're too old,  
They think she's too young,  
And the battle lines are clearly drawn.  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
She's a wild one,  
Runnin' free.  
  
She has future plans,  
And dreams at night,  
They tell her life's too hard,  
She says that's all right, yeah,  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
  
She's a wild one,  
With an angel's face,  
She's a woman child in a state of grace,  
When she was three years old on her daddy's knee,  
He said you can be anything you want to be,  
She's a wild one,  
Runnin' free.

Sleigh bells ring, are you listening?  
In the lane, snow is glistening  
A beautiful sight, we're happy tonight  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
Gone away, is the bluebird  
Here to stay, is a new bird  
He sings a love song, as we go along  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he is Parson Brown  
He'll say are you married?  
We'll say No man  
But you can do the job  
When you're in town  
  
Later on, we'll conspire  
As we dream, by the fire  
To face unafraid  
The plans that we've made  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
  
In the meadow we can build a snowman  
And pretend that he's a circus clown  
We'll have lots of fun with Mr. Snowman  
Until the other kids come knock him down  
  
When it's cold, ain't it thrilling  
When your nose, gets to chilling  
We'll frolic and play  
The Eskimo way  
Walking in a winter wonderland  
Walking in a winter wonderland

A little girl, a little small for her age  
A little too slow for the field day race  
Momma's waiting at the finish line  
And wipes the teardrops from her eyes  
She says, "You did just fine honey, that's okay  
Sometimes life's just that way  
You're gonna lose the race from time to time  
But you're always gonna find  
  
You can't lose me  
Bet your life  
I am here and I will always be  
Just a wish away  
Wherever you go  
No matter how far  
My love is where you are  
You won't be lost if you believe  
You can't lose me"  
  
Momma use to say "Girl it won't be long  
'Til it's time to go out on your own  
Chase your dreams find your place in life  
I know you'll do just fine"  
When that day finally came  
There were things she needed to but could not say  
So I whispered softly as I wiped  
The tears from Momma's eyes  
  
"You can't lose me  
Bet your life  
I am here and I will always be  
Just a wish away  
Wherever I go  
No matter how far  
My love is where you are  
You won't be lost if you believe  
You can't lose me"

You turn around  
Then you ask me behind tears of doubt  
Just what do I see in you  
Please don't cry  
I know sometimes it seems we barely get by  
But you don't see how much you do  
To get me through  
  
When the world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And I feel I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love  
You give me love  
  
I apologize  
If I never told you what you are in my eyes  
Oh baby, let me tell you now  
Every day  
Looks sweeter knowing you'll be there in every way  
Now how can you say that's not enough  
  
'Cause when the world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And it feels I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love  
  
You give me  
  
Everything my heart desires  
Morning sun and midnight fires  
Someone there to share my dreams  
With you I have everything  
  
When the world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And I feel I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love  
You give me love  
  
Yeah, when my world is cold  
And I need a friend to hold me  
You give me love  
You give me love  
And when my hope is gone  
And I feel I can't go on  
You pick me up  
You give me love

Heads I win, tails you lose  
I always play by my own rules  
And I don't believe in wasting time  
So long before we end this night  
  
I will have held you  
I will have kissed you  
I will have claimed you  
You will be mine  
I will have loved you  
Wrong or right  
I will have your heart  
You will be mine  
  
An unwritten law says a girl should wait  
Should let the man set his own pace  
But a woman in love, she's above the law  
So long before this night is gone  
  
I will have held you  
I will have kissed you  
I will have claimed you  
You will be mine  
I will have loved you  
Wrong or right  
I will have your heart  
You will be mine  
  
You top my list of things to do  
And I will get close to you  
Before this night is through  
  
I will have held you  
I will have kissed you  
I will have claimed you  
You will be mine  
I will have loved you  
Wrong or right  
I will have your heart  
You will be mine

Thought I saw you today  
You were standing in the sun then you turned away  
And I knew it couldn't be  
But my heart believed  
  
Oh, it seems like there's something everyday  
How could you be so far away  
  
When you're still here  
When I need you, you're not hard to find  
You're still here  
  
I can see you in my baby's eyes  
And I laugh and cry  
You're still here  
  
I had a dream last night  
That you came to me on silver wings  
And I flew away with you on a painted sky  
And I woke up wondering  
What was real  
Is it what you see and touch  
Or what you feel  
  
'Cause you're still here  
Oh, you're everywhere we've ever been  
You're still here  
  
I heard you in a stranger's laugh  
And I hung around to hear him laugh again  
Just once again  
  
Thought I saw you today  
You were standing in the sun then you turned away  
  
Away
