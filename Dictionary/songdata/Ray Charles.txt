A sentimental blues  
Will worry you  
And make you do  
Things that you  
Wouldn't do  
Only when you  
Hear these blues  
  
A sentimental blues  
Will wet your eye  
You wonder why  
You heave a sigh  
You start to cry  
Each time that you  
Hear these blues  
  
Sigh, sigh, sigh  
And drool  
Cry, cry, cry  
You fool  
Yes, I know that it's cool  
  
A sentimental blues  
Deep down inside  
Will make you hide  
Your foolish pride  
A sentimental blues  
Will make you lose  
Your mind  
  
Sigh, sigh, sigh  
And drool  
Cry, cry, cry  
You fool  
Yes, I know that it's cool  
  
A sentimental blues  
Deep down inside  
Will make you hide  
Your foolish pride  
A sentimental blues  
Will make you lose  
Your mind

I've been so many places in my life and time  
I've sung a lot of songs, I've made some bad rhyme  
I've acted out my life in stages  
With ten thousand people watching  
But we're alone now and I'm singin' this song for you  
  
I know your image of me is what I hope to be, baby  
I've treated you unkindly but girl can't you see  
There's no one more important to me  
So darling can't you please see through me  
'Cause we're alone now and I'm singin' my song for you  
  
You taught me precious secrets of the truth, withholdin' nothin'  
You came out in front and I was hiding  
But now I'm so much better so if my words don't come together  
Listen to the melody cause my love's in there hiding  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I love you for my life, 'cause you're a friend of mine  
And when my life is over, remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you  
  
I love you in a place where there's no space or time  
I've loved you for my life, yes, you're a friend of mine  
And when my life is over, remember when we were together  
We were alone and I was singin' my song for you, yes  
We were alone and I was singin' this song for you, baby  
We were alone and I was singin' my song,  
Singin' my song, singin' my song, singin' my song  
Singin' my song

Oh beautiful for heroes proved,  
In liberating strife,  
Who more than self, our country loved,  
And mercy more than life,  
  
America, America may God thy gold refine,  
Til all success be nobleness  
And every gain divined.  
  
And you know when I was in school,  
We used to sing it something like this, listen here:  
  
Oh beautiful, for spacious skies,  
For amber waves of grain,  
For purple mountain majesties,  
Above the fruited plain,  
  
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about  
America, sweet America  
You know, God done shed his grace on thee,  
He crowned thy good, yes he did, in brotherhood,  
From sea to shining sea.  
  
You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this  
(America, America, God shed his grace on thee)  
America, I love you America, you see,  
My God he done shed his grace on thee,  
And you oughta love him for it,  
Cause he, he, he ,he crowned thy good,  
He told me he would, with brotherhood,  
(From sea to shining Sea).  
Oh lord, oh lord, I thank you Lord

Well, I just stopped in this evening  
To get myself a little taste  
The music is nice and swinging  
And of course, I really dig the place  
Course, I haven't  
Had much sleep lately  
I feel sorta down and out  
Yeah, but look over there  
In the corner, man  
Oh, yeah, there's something  
To shout about  
Hey, hey, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go nowhere  
(Are you talking to me)  
I'm talking to you, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go nowhere  
Cause as soon as I pay the bartender  
Girl, I'll be right there  
She looked up and blushed and smiled  
And my heart skipped a beat  
Mmm, she's stacked from  
Her head down to her feet  
Hey, barkeep  
You better come here and get your bread  
This little girl's getting ready to split  
And I'm about to go out of my head  
Hey, hey, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go out that door  
(Are you talking to me)  
I'm talking to you, pretty baby  
Girl, don't you go out that door  
I'm afraid if I lose sight of you  
I just might not see you no more  
She slowed up just a little bit  
And turned her head and smiled  
She was 34-24-38  
And dressed in the latest style  
I finally caught up  
With the pretty little thing  
Before she got out on the street  
And she told she was  
Waiting on her old man  
Who was a policeman on the beat  
Hey, hey, pretty baby  
Girl, I'll see you another time  
(Are you talking to me)  
I'm talking to you, pretty baby  
Girl, I'll see you another time  
If you're a policeman's woman  
Lyrics courtesy Top40db.  
Just talking to you is a crime  
(That's right, bud, let's go)  
Oh, no  

Baby let me hold your hand  
Until I make you understand  
Ohh, baby, baby let me hold your hand  
I really believe, everything will sure be grand  
Baby I want you by my side  
Our love we could never hide  
Ohh, baby, baby I want you by my side  
Well you know pretty baby, our love we would never hide  
  
Baby I'll buy you a diamond ring  
Cadillac and everything  
Then baby, I'm gonna buy you a house in style  
Then I'll live there forever, yes lord with my little wife and child

Ray: When Uncle Sam called us up,  
We hit that Eastern Sand,  
Fought like Hell for three long years,  
In that South Asian Land,  
Clint: We met a few foreign ladies,  
Drank a lot of Lukewarm beer,

Then we bought 'em drinks all night,  
Ray: And when my lovin' wife left for points unknown,

And it proved to me, A womans love can fade,  
With the taste of Coors,  
And good friends always last,

Ah let me tell you people  
About this blackjack game  
It's caused me nothing but trouble  
And I've only myself to blame  
  
Hey hey hey yeah  
How unlucky can one man be  
Well every quarter I get  
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me  
  
My friends don't come around me  
Because I've been so blind  
I can't even borrow a nickle  
Now I've almost lost my mind  
  
Hey hey hey yeah  
How unlucky can one man be  
Well every quarter I get  
Lord, blackjack takes it away from me  
  
I sat there with two tens  
I thought I'd have some fun  
The dealer hit sixteen with a five  
Just enough to make twenty one  
  
Hey hey hey yeah yeah  
How unlucky can one man be  
Well every quarter I get  
Yeah, blackjack takes it away from me

Home's on the water and I don't like no land at all

I'd rather be dead than to stay here and be your dog  
  
So you C C Rider, see what you done done

You C C Rider, you see what you done done

Candy, I call my sugar Candy  
Because I'm sweet on Candy  
And Candy's sweet on me  
  
She understands me  
My understanding Candy  
And Candy's always handy  
When I need sympathy  
  
I wish that there were four of her  
So I could love much more of her  
She has taken my complete heart  
Got a sweet tooth for my sweetheart  
  
Candy, it's gonna be just dandy  
The day I take my Candy  
And make her mine, all mine

Oh love, oh love, oh careless love,  
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love.  
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love,  
Now now don't you see what your careless love has done.  
  
Well you worried my mother till she died  
And you caused my father to lose his mind.  
Now damn you I'm goin' to shoot you, Lord, I'm gonna shoot you both right
down,  
I'm gonna spare no one of you child till you spin next dyin'.  
  
Oh love, oh love, oh careless love.

Oh love, yes oh love, oh careless love.  
Oh love, I said love, oh careless love now  
Don't you see what your careless love has done, yeah.

Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There's where the cotton and the corn and taters grow,  
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,  
There's where the darkey's heart am longed to go.  
  
There's where I labored so hard for old massa,  
Day after day in the field of yellow corn,  
No place on earth do I love more sincerely,  
Than old Virginny, the state where I was born.  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There let me live 'till I wither and decay,  
Long by the old Dismal Swamp have I wandered,  
There's where this old darkies' life am passed away.  
  
Massa and misses, have long gone before me,  
Soon we will meet on that bright and golden shore.  
There we'll be happy and free from all sorrow,  
There's where we'll meet and we'll never part no more.  
  
Carry me back to old Virginny,  
There's where the cotton and the corn and tators grow,  
There's where the birds warble sweet in the spring time,  
There's where the old darkies' heart am longed to go.

Chattanooga Choo-Choo  
  
Hey there, pal, whatcha say?  
Step aside partner, it's my day  
Bend an ear and listen to my version  
(Of a really solid, Tennessee excursion)  
Pardon me boys, is that the Chattanooga Choo Choo?  
(Yes Yes) Track 29!  
Boy you can give me a shine  
(Can you afford to board, the Chattanooga Choo Choo?)  
I've got my fare  
And just a trifle to spare  
You leave the Pennsylvania station 'bout a quarter to four  
Read a magazine and then you're in Baltimore  
Dinner in the diner, nothing could be finer  
(then to have your ham and eggs in Carolina)  
When you hear the whistle blowing eight to the bar  
Then you know that Tennessee is not very far  
Shuffle all the coal in  
Gotta keep it rollin'  
(Whoo Whoo Chattanooga there you are)  
There's gonna be, a certain party at the station  
Satin and Lace  
I used to call funny face  
She's gonna cry  
Until I tell her that I'll never roam  
(So Chattanooga Choo Choo)  
Won't you choo choo me home.  
Get aboard...  
All aboard...  
Chattanooga choo choo  
Wont you choo choo me home

Now it looks as though they're here to stay.  
Oh, I believe in yesterday.  
Suddenly, I'm not half the man I used to be.  
There's a shadow hanging over me.  
Oh, yesterday came suddenly.  
Why she had to go, I don't know,  
She wouldn't say.  
I said something wrong,  
Now I long for yesterday.  
Yesterday love was such an easy game to play.  
Now I need a place to hide away.  
Oh, I believe in yesterday.

Cryin' at my front door  
You done your daddy dirty  
I tell you, he just don't want you no more  
  
  
  
Don't let the sun catch you lyin'  
Lyin' at my front door  
Daddy's done turned salty  
Baby, you made him so sore  
  
Whoa, you know you done me dirty now  
And I just don't want you no more  
  

It brings a tear,  
Into my eyes,  
When I begin,  
To realize,  
I've cried so much,  
Since you've been gone,  
I guess I'm drowning in my own tears,  
  
I sit and cry,  
Just like a child  
My pouring tears  
Are runnin' wild  
If you don't think  
You'll be home soon  
I guess I'll drown in my own tears  
  
I know it's true  
Into each life  
Some rain, rain must pour  
I'm so blue  
Here without you  
It keeps raining  
More and more  
  
Why don't you  
Come on home  
Oh yes so I won't  
Be all alone  
If you don't think  
You'll be home soon  
  
I guess I'll  
(Drown in my own tears)  
Ooh, don't let me  
(Drown in my own tears)  
When I'm in trouble, baby  
(Drown in my own tears)  
Oh, yeah, baby don't let me  
(Drown in my own tears)  
I guess I'll drown in my own tears  
Oh, mmmmm.

There were times I left your heart in pain  
Time again I've turned and walked away  
I get to where I'm going just to find  
Won't be happy in this world  
If you're not by my side  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
My heart told me to break away  
Now I'm out here far away  
Wish that I could hold you in the night  
Then I'd wake up to a morning  
That is warm and bright  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
Smile for me, won't you, baby  
Forever you'll be on my mind  
Drink with me won't you baby  
We're gonna make it right this time  
There's no one else like you  
Anything you want, I'll do  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
My heart told me to break away  
Now I'm here so far away  
Wish that I could hold you in the night  
Then I'd wake up to a morning  
That is warm and bright  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
Smile for me, won't you, baby  
Forever you'll be on my mind  
Drink with me won't you baby  
We're gonna make it right this time  
There's no one else like you  
Anything you want, I'll do  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
Smile for me, won't you, baby  
Forever you'll be on my mind  
Drink with me won't you baby  
We're gonna make it right this time  
There's no one else like you  
Anything you want, I'll do  
Ellie, my love so sweet  
Ellie, my love so sweet

God bless America again  
You see all the troubles that she's in  
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again  
  
God, I sure do wish You'd bless America again  
You know like You did way back when it all began  
You blessed her then but we just sorta kinda take it for granted  
And never did ask again  
  
So God just hold her hand that's all  
And if she should stumble, please, don't let her fall  
  
God bless America again  
You see all the troubles that she's in  
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again  
  
You know, I don't understand to everythin' I'm readin' here  
About what's wrong with America  
And if You don't have a lotta good learnin'  
I guess there's a lotta things You don't understand  
  
But let me say this God, she's like a mother to me  
And though all I am or ever hope to be I owe to You and to her  
Wash her pretty face, dry her eyes  
And then God bless America again

Let me tell you 'bout a girl I know  
She is my baby and she lives next door  
Every mornin' 'fore the sun comes up  
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
  
When I'm in trouble and I have no friend  
I know she'll go with me until the end  
Everybody asks me how I know  
I smile at them and say, "She told me so"  
That's why I know, oh, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
  
Now, if I call her on the telephone  
And tell her that I'm all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear her (knock, knock, knock, knock) on my door  
  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
She kisses me and she holds me tight  
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
  
Now, if I call her on the telephone  
And tell her that I'm all alone  
By the time I count from one to four  
I hear her (knock, knock, knock, knock) on my door  
  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
When there is nobody else around  
She kisses me and she holds me tight  
And tells me, "Daddy, everything's all right"  
That's why I know, yes, I know  
Hallelujah, I just love her so  
Oh, hallelujah  
Don't you know, I just love her so?  
She's my little woman, waitin' all this time  
Babe, I'm a little fool for you, little girl

Hey girl, I want you to know  
I'm gonna miss you so much if you go  
Hey girl, I'll tell you no lie  
Something deep inside of me's going to die  
  
If you say so long, if this is goodbye  
Hey girl, this can't be true  
How am I supposed to exist without you?  
Hey girl, don't put me on  
  
What's gonna happen to me when you're gone?  
How will I live, how can I go on?  
How can I go on?  
Hey girl, now sit yourself down  
  
I'm not afraid to get down on the ground  
And beg you, beg you to stay  
Don't go away  
Hey girl

Hey, hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
Hey, sweet baby, don't you think maybe  
We could find us a brand new recipe?  
I got a hot rod Ford and a two dollar bill  
And I know a spot right over the hill  
There's soda pop and the dancin's free  
So if you wanna have fun come along with me  
Hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  
I'm free and ready, so we can go steady  
How's about savin' all your time for me?  
No more lookin', I know I've been tooken  
How's about keepin' steady company?  
I'm gonna throw my date-book over the fence  
And find me one for five or ten cents  
I'll keep it 'til it's covered with age  
'Cause I'm writin' your name down on every page  
Hey, good lookin', whatcha got cookin'?  
How's about cookin' somethin' up with me?  

Well, did you ever wake up in the morning?  
Just about the break of day  
Reach over and rub the pillow  
Where your baby used to lay  
  
[Chorus]  
Hey Now!  
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now  
Well, you know they make you feel so bad  
That you lay right down and die  
  
Then you put on your crying  
Like you've never cried before  
You even cry so loud  
You give the blues to your neighbor next door  
  
And you say, Hey Now!  
Hey now, Hey now, Hey now, Hey now  
Well, you know they make you feel so bad  
That you lay right down and die  
  
Well, I got the blues so bad now  
I'm tellin' ya it just hurt my feet to walk now  
I got the blues so bad now people  
It justa hurt my tongue to talk now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Then you cry Lord, Lord  
Won't you hear my plea?  
I know you can have mercy on everybody  
So won't you please send a little bit down to me?

Hide nor hair  
Oh, I was lying in the bed with fever  
And I was burning up inside  
My baby walked in my bedroom  
And I could hardly open my eyes  
She said she was going to the pawn shop  
Just across the track  
She started packing some clothes in a hurry  
And then she said she would be right back  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
I remember so well when she slammed the door  
But the girl didn't make it back no more  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I waited for her twenty four hours  
And I was just about to starve to death  
It didn't look like she was coming back  
So I had to look out for myself  
Well I called the police department  
To find out what they knew  
They said, no by heck but we will get her yet  
Because they were looking for her too.  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
Well I don't know what happened across the track  
But I know my baby didn't make it back  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.  
Well I called my Dr. Foster  
And when the girl answered the phone  
I got a funny feeling  
The way she said Dr. Foster had gone  
She said he left with a lady patient  
About twenty four hours ago  
I added two and two and here's what I got  
I got I'll never see that girl no mo'  
But I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day  
Well I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since she went away  
If Dr. foster has got her then I know I'm through  
Cause he's got medicine and money too.  
I ain't seen hide nor hair my baby since that day.  
Whoa no

Hit the road Jack and don't cha come back

You're the meanest old woman that I ever have seen  
Well I guess if you say so

When I got misery, oh my where are you, honey  
Honey, oh honey honey, where can you be  
Whisperin' when the lights are low, to each  
Teardrop on my pillow  
Honey honey, honey honey, where are you  
I crossed the scalds in dessert, just to be where  
You are  
I want you need you love you, but still we're apart  
When I want to hold you, oh my where are you  
Honey honey, my honey honey, where can you be  
  
When I want to hold you, oh my where are you  
Honey honey, my honey honey, where can you be

How long baby, how long has that evening train been gone?  
It's been gone since that blood red sun went down  
  
Thought I heard a whistle and I think I see a train  
Deep in my heart there is an aching pain  
Said how long, how long, baby how long?  
  
Well look down them tracks and feeling so bad  
Lost the best woman that a poor man ever had  
How long, well how long baby, how long?  
  
Well how long baby, how long has that evening train been gone?  
It's been gone since that blood red sun went down  
  
How long baby, how long has that evening train been gone?  
It's been gone since that blood red sun went down

I could cry salty tears  
Where have I been all these years?  
Little wow, tell me now  
How long has this been goin' on?  
There were chills up my spine  
And some thrills I can't define  
Listen sweet, I repeat  
How long has this been goin' on?  
Oh, I feel that I could melt  
Into heaven I'm hurled  
I know how Columbus felt  
Finding another world  
Kiss me once, then once more  
What a dunce I was before  
What a break, for heaven's sake  
How long has this been goin' on?

Girl, I'm so lonesome tonight  
I was just lyin' here wonderin' where you are  
And what you're doin'  
And Lord knows the thing that worries me the most  
  
Is who yer don' it with  
That's why, if you don't mind,  
I'd like to sing these words to ya, ya see  
I've got new books to read  
  
But they ain't what I need  
And this picture of you  
Just won't do, no, no, baby  
And the postcards you send would never (never) mend  
  
The pain in my heart when we're apart  
Girl I can make it through the day  
But oh, please help me through the lonely nites  
When I'm on my job It's not too hard  
  
But when I go home  
And I'm all alone (and I'm by myself babe you heard me)  
You know you're my crutch I need you're sweet touch  
Then it gets the night time again Lord when will it end  
  
I'll make it through the day say, but oh  
You don't know nothin' about the lonely nites  
Well now night go away please hurry up day  
'Cause my night lite burns and I toss and turn  
  
Tell me what would I see if I turned on TV  
I don't know what to do, Lord knows, I need me some you  
I can make it through the day  
Please help me through the lonely night

I could have been a gambler  
'Cause I'm good with the cards  
I could have been a lover  
Breakin' other's hearts  
And I feel so silly  
Bettin' on the dice  
And a lover seldom sees  
The same girl twice  
And that is why (that is why)  
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)  
I chose to sing the blues, yes I did  
Now, I could have been a doctor  
Helping the sick  
And I could have been a lawyer  
But you know that ain't my stick  
'Cause I feel so bad  
If a patient didn't do well  
And I feel just as bad  
To leave a client in jail  
And that is why (that is why)  
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)  
I chose to sing the blues  
  
[Sax solo]  
  
Now a man has a lot  
That he could present  
Just to think I could have been  
President  
But I can't understand  
What politicians say  
So I want to talk to you  
In my own little way  
And that is why (that is why)  
That's why I chose (that's why I chose)  
I chose to sing the blues  
Yes I did, friends  
Don't you know what I mean  
I like what I'm doin'  
You know, I like the blues  
Everybody understands  
What I mean when I say  
Something like this here  
Unnnnnnn-hoo  
Yeah  
Yeah-hoo  
That's what I'm talkin' 'bout when I sing

Once I was young...  
Yesterday, perhaps...  
Danced with Jim and Paul  
And kissed some other chaps.  
  
Once I was young,  
But never was naive.  
I thought I had a trick or two  
Up my imaginary sleeve.  
  
And now I know I was naive.  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
  
How sublime it was too!  
I didn't know what time it was  
You hold my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
  
And I'll say it was grand.  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,  
  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
I didn't know what time it was  
Live was no prize.  
I wanted love and here it was  
  
Shining out of your eyes.  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.  
Once I was old --  
  
Twenty years or so --  
Rather well preserved:  
The wrinkles did't show.  
Once I was old,  
  
But not too old for fun.  
I used to hunt for little girls  
Up my immaginary gun.  
But now I ain for only one!  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Then I met you.  
Oh, what a lovely time it was,  
How sublime it was too!  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
You hold my hand.  
Warm like the month of May it was,  
And I'll say it was grand.  
  
Grand to be alive, to be young,  
To be mad, to be yours alone!  
Grand tosee your face, feel your touch,  
Hear your voice say I'm all your own.  
  
I didn't know what time it was  
Live was no prize.  
I whanted love and here it was  
Shining out of your eyes.  
  
I'm wise,  
And I know what time it is now.

Well, I got a woman, way over town  
She's good to me, oh yeah

Is right there, now, in the home

She's good to me, oh yeah

Whoa, yeah, oh, yeah

Don't you know I'm about as happy as I can be  
'Cause you made a happy man out of me  
You took a man wso was tired of living  
And installed the joy of life whit all that you're giving  
And you came along in just a nick of time  
'Cause I was just about to lose my mind  
The frown upon my face became a smile  
And I love you more than I ever have  
Chorus  
Oh, I want to thank you baby  
For what you've done for me  
Oh, I want to thank you baby  
For helping me to see  
That love is powerfull and what everybody needs  
And I thenk you for givin it to me  
I had just fell out of love when I met you  
Really did belive that love and were through  
But I knew it right from the first time I kissed you  
I felt your lips and could not resist ya  
Ever since that kiss I've been in love whit you  
'Cause you been so good to me and so true  
We've stood together through thick and thin  
And I love you more than I ever have  
Chorus  
There's a certain way that you say I love you  
Makes me want to lay down my life for you  
You change my outlook on life and love  
When it comes to you I just connot get enough of you girl  
I just want this one thing understood  
All I want to do is make ya feel good  
And you've been so dog-gone good to me I say  
That I love you more then I ever have  
The love is powerfull and everybody needs  
And I thank you for giving it to me  
Chorus

I love you so much it hurts me  
Darlin', that's why I'm so blue  
I'm so afraid to go to bed at night  
I'm afraid of losing you.  
  
I love so much it hurts me  
And there's nothing I can do  
I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever  
I love you so much it hurts me so.  
  
I love you so much it hurts me  
And there's nothing I can do  
I want to hold you, my dear, forever and ever  
I love you so much it hurts me so.

Don't tell me  
About a night in June  
Or a shady lane  
Beneath the velvet moon  
  
Don't tell me  
Cause I wanna talk about you  
  
Don't mention that waterfall  
Or that grassy spot  
Where crickets softly call  
  
Please don't tell me  
Cause, baby  
I wanna talk about you  
  
The moon and the stars  
The objects on Mars  
Are things that  
We've talked of before  
  
But your love for me  
Was the question  
And your answer  
Threw back Heaven's door  
  
So tell me  
Your love will be sincere  
Then, my darling  
You need never fear  
  
Cause I love you  
And I wanna talk about you  
About you  
  
So don't tell me  
Because I wanna talk about you

You have loved lots of girls in the sweet long-ago  
And each has meant heaven to you  
You have vowed your affection to each one in turn  
And have sworn to them all you'd be true  
You have kissed 'neath the moon while the world seemed in tune,  
Then you've left her to hunt a new game.  
Does it ever occur to you later my boy, that she's probably doing the same?  
  
If you want to feel wretched and lonely and blue,  
Just imagine the girl you love best  
In the arms of some fellow who's stealing a kiss  
From the lips that you once fondly pressed  
But the world moves apace and the loves of today  
Flit away with a smile and a tear,  
So you can never tell who's kissing her now  
Or just whom you'll be kissing next year.  
  
I wonder who's kissing her now, I wonder who's teaching her how,  
I wonder who's looking into her eyes, breathing sighs, telling lies.  
I wonder who's buying the wine for lips that I used to call mine.  
I wonder if she ever tells him of me, I wonder who's kissing her now.

If I could  
I'd protect you from the sadness in your eyes  
Give you courage in a world of compromise  
Yes, I would  
  
If I could  
I would teach you all the things I've never learned  
And I'd help you cross the bridges that I've burned  
Yes, I would  
  
If I could  
I would try to shield your innocence from time  
But the part of life I gave you isn't mine  
I've watched you grow, so I could let you go  
  
If I could  
I would help you make it through the hungry years  
But I know that I could never cry your tears  
But I would If I could  
  
Yes, If I live  
In a time and place where you don't want to be  
You don't have to walk along this road with me  
My yesterday won't have to be your way  
  
If I knew  
I would try to change the world I brought you to  
And there isn't very much that I could do  
But I would If I could  
  
Oh baby  
Daddy wants to protect you  
And help my baby through the hungriest  
'Cause your part of me  
And if you ever ever need  
Said a shoulder to cry on  
Or just someone to talk to  
I'll be there, I'll be there  
  
I didn't change your world  
But I would if I could  
  
Oh darling, I love you baby.

Ray Charles  
Jimmy Lewis (indented)  
[both together]  
  
[Uh-Uh]  
Wait a minute, Jimmy, look here  
I'm listenin'  
As I was wakin' up this mornin'  
Well well  
Oh Lord, you know I felt pretty good, Yes I did  
I began to stretch and yawn  
What for Ray?  
Just to see if I could  
I can dig it  
  
All at once I got a funny feelin'  
That something around here was goin on wrong  
Hmm  
So you know what I did Jimmy?  
What?  
I got up and I began to look all around for my baby  
Was that it?  
That was it, you know the woman had packed up and gone  
Oh lord  
  
That's why I say if everybody went to heaven  
Hey-ey-ey, I believe I'd miss the call  
But you see if it wasn't for bad luck,  
Trying to tell you son if it wasn't for bad luck, now now  
Oh, oh, I wouldn't have no luck at all  
Would you believe I wouldn't have no luck at all  
  
Looka here Ray, you think your luck is bad?  
Listen ta what happen to me  
Alright  
Now listen now  
Got a tip on a horse someone gave me, hey hey  
Yeah  
Pawned my last suit to make the bet  
No you didn't  
Yes I did  
Put every dime I had on him, ah  
What?  
Listen, you know he ain't showed up yet  
  
Oh! Tell ya I got so disgusted now  
Yeah  
Said I'll go back home and sleep some more  
Now that seem like the right thing to do  
But by the time I got back to my room  
Are you listenin' Ray?  
Yeah yeah, I'm payin' attention  
You know the landlord had padlocked my door  
Why that dirty . . .  
  
Tell ya a slow horse and a fast woman  
Hey hey hey lord they sure did let me fall  
That's why I say ah  
If it wasn't for bad luck sugar now  
Hey if it wasn't for bad luck y'all  
Oh! I wouldn't have no luck at all  
  
Oh Ray, listen, I wouldn't have no luck at all  
Huh-Yep. But wait a minute, you ain't heard nothin' yet  
Let me tell you what happened  
Tell me about it  
  
I decided I'd go out walkin'  
Say what?  
Um-hm. And you know even that failed  
Now how can a walk fail, Ray?  
Because some man snatched a woman's pocketbook way across town  
Say what?  
Yeah, and uh guess who they put in jail?  
Do tell, do tell  
  
Jimmy, I just can't understand it  
I know what you mean  
I know there's got to be some kind of explanation  
There's got to be, there's got to be  
Lord, lord, lord, lord I ain't done nothing wrong  
So tell me why I'm doing two years probation  
Man I don't know, I got the same trouble  
  
They got me having to walk a chump line  
Say what?  
Oh, with my, with my back up against a wall  
That's tough, Ray  
That's why if it wasn't for bad luck sugar  
Oh I tell everybody if it wasn't for bad luck now now  
I believe, I believe I would have no luck at all  
I just would have no luck at all  
Looka here Ray, let me tell you something  
Hm?  
Now you know, you know about this here  
Yeah  
You know I was sittin' home one evening,  
Well I didn't have a thing to do  
Yeah, that's happened to me sometimes  
So I thought I'd go out dancin', you know  
Yeah, yeah  
And do a little of that boogaloo  
I, I kinda like that myself  
Finally, I got myself a partner, now  
Yeah  
But old Ray, wouldn't you know  
Mm-hm, somthing musta happened bad  
Some man said, "You got my woman, boy"  
Uh oh  
And he stood about seven foot four  
Oops! Oops!  
As they walked away I stood there  
Feeling kinda sad and kinda small  
That's why I say If it wasn't for bad luck sugar  
  
[whoa, if it wasn't for bad luck, y'all now  
hey, hey, hey, we'd have no luck at all]  
  
Hey now!  
Yeah, I say we would have no luck at all  
Jimmy, I want you to tell me about that  
seven foot four What did you do!  
Well Ray, anytime a man is seven foot four and you  
messin' with his woman, it's time for you to go  
Oh yeah?  
Lord have mercy  
I, I, I, I can understand it,  
it made you feel like you want to holler a little bit  
Made me feel like I want to Aahhhhhhh-ow!  
Yeah man, when I run into that situation,  
makes me want to cry a little bit like this Ooh-hoo!

If you were mine  
I'd never let you leave me  
If you were mine  
I'd never let you go  
  
Because you are  
Just what I've always wanted  
And I think that you oughta know  
  
From the moment I first saw you  
Girl, you went straight to my brain  
In my heart I've got a feeling  
That I could never explain  
  
If you were mine  
You'd never know no sorrow  
If you were mine  
I'd marry you tomorrow  
Yes, I would  
  
Believe me, girl  
What the occasion  
If you call me  
I'll come with no persuasion  
  
You just call  
And I'll come running  
Oh, yes, I will, baby  
Come rain or storm  
Hail or snow  
  
Cause the way I feel about you  
No place is too remote to go  
  
Oh, well, baby, oh, well  
Now now now now now...  
Oh, baby, oh, well...

I'm a fool to care  
When you treat me this way  
Whoa, I love you so  
But, darling, I know  
I'm a fool to care  
  
I'm a fool to cry  
Since you told me goodbye  
Oh, you can't be true  
So what can I do  
I'm a fool to care  
(I'm a fool to care)  
  
I know I should laugh, ha ha  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
I'm a fool to care  
When you don't care for me  
Why should I pretend  
I know I'll lose in the end  
I'm a fool to care  
  
I know I should laugh  
And call it a day  
But I know I would cry  
If you went away  
  
I'm a fool to care  
When you don't care for me  
So why should I pretend  
I'll lose in the end  
Oh, I'm a fool to care

I never cared much for moonlit sky  
I never winked back at firefly  
But now that the sun in your eyes  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light  
  
We used to walk out to the park  
Share some red rose in the dark  
When you came, you gave me a sign  
Like a four hour alarm of fire  
  
Quincy Jones  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light  
I'm beginning to see the light

Can you tell me, is there anyone out there  
Can you hear me, calling you  
If you hear, will you listen  
Is that too much to ask you to do  
I've been searching for someone to care  
Ooh Lord is there anyone out there  
Will you help me, I need someone to talk to  
A brother who I can rely on  
Whose not hard to relate to  
No, I don't need a shoulder to cry on  
All I need is someone with sometime to spare  
Yeah, I just ask is there anyone out there  
  
[Chorus:]  
Wow if I sing, will you sing, will you sing out with me  
Cause I'm down  
I don't think there's no way to be  
So, if you there, will you answer, answer all my call  
Tell me, is there anyone out there at all  
  
Com' on and help me  
Is there anyone out there  
Can you give me, a moment or two  
Take the time out to meet me  
All, I want to do, please is lay some good friendship on you  
I got so much I want to share, I want to share  
Is there anyone out there  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
Please help me, Lord I need someone to talk to  
Like a brother who I can rely on  
Yeah...whose not hard to relate to  
I don't need a shoulder to cry on  
All I need is someone with just a little time to spare  
Lord have mercy  
Is there anyone out there

It's the same old story that they all hand me. The Preacher tells me these are
troubled times. But I know the Lord's been in tougher scrapes then this one.
Ain't gonna worry, ain't gonna worry, ain't gonna worry my mind.Got no money
in the pocket.You don't get rich working overtime. But as long as you can't
buy the springtime in Virginia. I ain't gonna worry, No I ain't gonna worry,
Ain't gonna worry my mind. That is all that ever makes you richer. Oh well, if
the truth be told, Moonlight spins my only silver, and the sun is my only
gold. Oh ya. So go on wishin', go on prayin', go on sayin', I'll hit better
times. How in the world could you love me any better? Ain't gonna worry, I
tell ya. I ain't gonna worry no more. Ain't gonna worry my mind.

It had to be you.  
It had to be you.  
I've wandered around,  
Finally found somebody who,  
Could make me be true.  
Whoa whoa whoa could make me be blue.  
And, even be glad just to be sad thinkin' of you  
  
Some others I've seen, might never be mean.  
Might never be cross.  
Or, try to be boss.  
But, they wouldn't do.  
For nobody else gave me a thrill.  
With all your faults I love you still.  
It had to be you.  
Wonderful you.  
It had to be you  
  
'Cause nobody else gave me a thrill.  
With all yo' faults  
I love you still now.  
And it had to be you.  
It just had to be you.  
It had to be you

As I passed by  
A real fine hotel  
A chick walked out  
She sure looked swell  
I gave her the eye  
And started to carry on  
When a Cadillac cruised up  
And 'swish' she was gone.  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, Cadillac.  
A little later on  
A theater I passed  
I spotted another chick  
And did she have class  
I was all set  
To write her name in my book  
When her husband came up and gave me a  
Real dirty look.  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
It should've been me  
To have been her chaperone.  
When I got to the corner  
I saw a sharp cat  
With a 300 dollar suit on  
And a 100 dollar hat  
He was standing on the sidewalk  
By a Dynaflow  
When a voice within said,  
"C'mon daddy, let's go."  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
It should've been me  
Hey hey hey, hey, driving that, Dynaflow.  
I ate a bowl of chili  
And I felt ok  
At least until I passed  
This fine Cafe  
I saw a guy eatin'  
A great big steak  
While a waitress stood by feedin' him  
Ice cream and cake.  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
It should've been me  
With that real fine chick  
You know, it should've been me  
Eatin' ice, cream and cake.  
It should've been me  
Gettin' my natural kicks  
It should've been me  
Gettin' my natural kicks  
Hey hey hey, hey, lovin' those, crazy chicks...

When I was seventeen  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for small town girls  
And soft summer nights  
We'd hide from the lights  
On the village green  
When I was seventeen  
  
When I was twenty-one  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for city girls  
Who lived up the stair  
With all that perfumed hair  
And it came undone  
When I was twenty-one  
  
When I was thirty-five  
It was a very good year  
It was a very good year for blue-blooded girls  
Of independent means  
We'd ride in limousines  
And their chauffeurs would drive  
When I was thirty-five  
  
But now the days grow short  
I'm in the autumn of my years  
And I think of my life as vintage wine  
From fine old kegs  
From the brim to the dregs  
And it poured sweet and clear  
It was a very good year

You said before me met  
That your life was awful tame  
Well, I took you to a night club  
And the whole band knew your name. oh,  
  
Well, baby, baby, baby

Oh, somehow your story don't ring true,  
Well, I've got news for you.  
  
Well, you phoned me you'd be late  
Cause you took the wrong express  
And then you walked in smiling  
With your lipstick all a mess  
  
Oh, let me say to you little mama,  
Whoa, I've got news for you  
Ah, your story don't ring true lil' girl  
Yeah, I've got news for you.  
  
Oh, you wore a diamond watch,  
Claimed it was from uncle Joe.  
When I looked at the inscription  
It said love from daddy-o.  
  
Oh, well baby, whoa lil' girl, I want to say

Ah, if you think that jive will do  
Let me tell you, oh,

Just to keep from crying  
I'm laughing and clowning  
Just to keep from crying  
  
I'm trying to hide the fact  
That I've got a worried mind  
  
Being the life of the party  
Seems to be my role  
Ever since you left me, girl  
Being the life of the party  
Seems to be my role  
  
I'm trying to hide my feelings  
And I'm trying to hide my soul  
Yes, I am  
  
Well, listen, one more thing  
  
I stand in the doorway  
Watching all the girls go through

To make my mind off of you, girl

Oh, hey, y'all  
This is brother Ray  
I got something I wanna  
Talk to you about  
  
I'm tired of running  
From town to town  
Now I'm ready to stop, y'all  
And settle down  
  
Cause it's a life of misery  
When you're alone  
And I've got to have somebody  
To call my own  
  
Oh, baby, let me love you  
Whoa, baby, I wanna love you  
I need to love you, girl  
  
I'll be your water  
When your well goes dry  
And your good loving man, honey  
Til the day I die  
  
I'll be your shelter, yes, I will  
Whenever it rains  
And like Dr. Feelgood  
I can ease your pain

With love and affection  
To keep me satisfied  
  
Oh, Lord, I'm tired of running  
From town to town  
That's why I want you, girl  
To help me settle down  
  
Whoa, oh, oh, oh  
Oh, baby, looking so good...

Let's go get stoned, let's go get stoned  
When your baby won't let you in  
Got a few pennies, a bottle of gin  
Just call your buddy on the telephone  
Let's go get stoned  
  
Let's go get stoned, let's go get stoned  
When you work so hard all the day long  
And every thing you do seems to go wrong  
Just drop by my place on your way home  
Let's go get stoned  
  
It ain't no harm, you're taking just a taste  
But don't blow your cool and start messing up the place  
It ain't no harm you're faking just a nip  
But make sure you don't fall down bust your lip  
Let's go get stoned, let's go get stoned

Come they told me (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
A newborn King to see (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
Our finest gifts we bring pa-rum pum pum pum  
To lay before the King  
So to honor Him (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
when we come  
  
Little Baby (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
I am a poor boy too (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
I have no gift to bring (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
that's fit to give our King  
Shall I play for You? (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
On my drum  
  
Mary nodded (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
The ox and lamb kept time (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
I played my drum for Him (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
I played my best for Him  
Then He smiled at me (pa-rum pum pum pum)  
Me and my drum

A boy is born in hard time Mississippi  
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty  
His parents give him love and affection  
To keep him strong moving in the right direction  
Living just enough, just enough for the city... Ee ha!  
His father works some days for fourteen hours  
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar  
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many  
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny  
Living just enough, just enough for the city... Yeah!  
His sister's black but she is sho'nuff pretty  
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy  
To walk to school she's got to get up early  
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty  
Living just enough, just enough for the city... Um hum  
Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many  
His patience's long but soon he won't have any  
To find a job is like a haystack needle  
Cause where he lives they don't use colored people  
Living just enough, just enough for the city...  
Living just enough...  
For the city... Ooh, ooh  
(Repeat several times)  
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty  
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City  
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution  
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution  
Living just enough, just enough for the city... V yeah, yeah, yeah!  
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow  
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow  
This place is cruel no where could be much colder  
If we don't change the world will soon be over  
Living just enough, stop giving just enough for the city!!!!  
La, La, La, La, La, La,  
Da Ba Da Da Da Da Da Da  
Da Da Da Da Da Da  
Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da Da

Long time ago in Bethlehem,  
So the holy Bible say,  
The Mary's boy child, Jesus Christ,  
Was born on Christmas Day.  
  
Hark, now hear the angels sing,  
A new King was born today,  
And man will live forever more,  
Because of Christmas Day.  
  
And you know when I was in school,  
We used to sing it something like this, listen here:  
  
While the good shepherds watching their flocks by night,  
Them see a bright new shining star,  
They hear the heavenly choir just singing a song,  
That the music seemed to come from afar.  
  
But now wait a minute, I'm talking about:  
Now, Joseph and his sweet wife, Mary,  
You know, God come to Bethlehem that night,  
Them find no place, yes he did, to born that she child,  
Not a single room was in sight.  
  
Alvin singing and listen:  
  
(By and by they find a little nook)  
(In a stable all forlorn, )  
(And in a manger cold and dark, )  
(Mary's little boy was born.)  
  
You know, I wish I had somebody to help me sing this  
(Trumpets sound and angels sing, listen to what they say)  
Trumpets sound, I love you and angels sing, you see,  
Oh, Lord, be careful, listen what they say,  
And you oughta love him for it,  
'Cause that, that, that, that man will live,  
He told me he would, forever more,  
(Because of Christmas Day).  
Oh Lord, oh Lord, I thank you Lord  
(Christmas Day).

Ah, you can talk about the pit, barbecue  
The band was jumpin', the people too  
Ah, mess around  
They doin' the mess around  
They doin' the mess around,  
Everybody doin' the mess around  
  
Ah, everybody was juiced, you can, bet your soul  
They did the boogie-woogie, with a steady roll  
They mess around  
They doin' the mess around  
They doin' the mess around,  
Everybody doin' the mess around  
  
Now, ah, when I say stop don't you move a peg  
When I say go, just ah, shake your leg  
And do the mess around  
I declare, do the mess around

Everybody's doin' the mess around  
  
Now let me have it there boy

Pennies in a stream  
Falling leaves, a sycamore  
Moonlight in Vermont  
  
Icy finger-waves  
Ski trails on a mountainside  
Snowlight in Vermont  
  
Telegraph cables, they sing down the highway  
And travel each bend in the road  
People who meet in this romantic setting  
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...  
  
Evening summer breeze  
Warbling of a meadowlark  
Moonlight in Vermont  
  
  
Telegraph cables, how they sing down the highway  
And they travel each bend in the road  
People who meet in this romantic setting  
Are so hypnotized by the lovely...  
  
Evening summer breeze  
The warbling of a meadowlark  
Moonlight in Vermont  
You and I and Moonlight in Vermont

Sometimes I stop and wonder  
How can this thing go on  
For when I'm with my baby  
She always make me feel alone  
  
No, my woman don't dig me, no, no  
Boys, I know I'm gonna  
Know the reason why  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, we're as far from each other  
As the Earth is from the sky  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, I put my arms around her  
She'll flinch and move away  
And that's not just one time  
You know that's each and every day  
  
I tell you, my woman  
She don't dig me now  
No, no, no, no, now, now  
Boys, I know the reason why  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, we're far from each other  
Hey, yeah, as the Earth  
Is from the sky  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
We don't have enough in common  
To act like lovers should  
I think that's the reason  
Our love affair's no good  
  
You know my woman don't dig me  
No, no, no, no  
Now people I tell you  
I know the reason why  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)  
  
Well, we're far from each other  
Hey, hey, hey, yeah  
As the Earth is from the sky  
  
(No, no, my baby don't dig me)  
(No, no, she just don't dig me)...

INTRO:  
(My heart cries for you)  
(Sighs for you, dies for you)  
(And my arms long for you)  
(Please come back to me)  
  
If you're in Arizona, I'll follow you  
If you're in Minnesota, I'll be there too  
You'll have a million chances to start anew  
Because my love is endless for you  
  
My heart cries for you  
Sighs for you, dies for you  
And my arms long for you  
Please come back to me  
  
An unimportant quarrel was what we had  
We have to learn to live with the good and bad  
Together we were happy, apart we're sad  
This loneliness is driving me mad  
  
My heart cries for you  
Sighs for you, dies for you  
And my arms long for you  
Please come back to me  
  
Please come back to me  
Please come back, come back, come back to me

The time has come to air my feelings  
There's just so much confusion going down  
I'm not the kind to be complaining  
But sometimes you got to stand out from the crowd  
Everyone's got their own opinion  
And you know I sure got mine  
  
It's my world  
Don't you come a messin' with my world  
I don't appreciate the fact some people just can't see  
It's hurting you and me  
It's my world  
My world, your world, our world, one world  
  
We all got to get it together  
There's just no other place to go  
If we can't find some peace with each other  
Then we'll be dead before you know  
I don't have all the answers  
I'm just one man who's searching for a change  
  
It's my world  
Don't you come a messin' with my world  
I don't appreciate the fact some people just can't see  
It's hurting you and me  
It's my world  
My world, your world, our world, one world  
  
I hear the cries of the people  
From every single corner of this earth  
Where's the love, the compassion  
Where's the hope what's the future worth

(I need someone to say I do)  
No one to cry to now, no one to say goodnight  
No one to tell my troubles to  
I've got no one, to sigh to, no one to hold me  
  
Tight  
No one to chear me when I'm blue  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
One prayer  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
  
Someone to whisper I love you  
When I go home to my lonely room  
And find there's no one there  
And each night I think of you, so please answer this  
  
One prayer  
And you'll need someone, I said to cry to  
Someone to say I do  
Someone to whisper I love you

There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
There's a bright golden haze on the meadow,  
The corn is as high as an elephant's eye,  
An' it looks like its climbin' clear up to the sky.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Oh what a beautiful morning,  
Oh what a beautiful day,  
I've got a wonderful feeling,  
Everything's going my way.  
  
All the cattle are standing like statues,  
All the cattel are standing like statues,  
They don't turn their heads as they see me ride by.  
But a little brown mav'rick is winking her eye.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
All the sounds of the earth are like music,  
The breeze is so busy it don't miss a tree,  
And an ol' Weepin' Willer is laughin' at me.

Here we all work 'long the Mississippi  
Here we all work while the white folk play  
Pullin' them boats  
from the dawn till sunset  
Gettin' no rest till the judgment day  
  
Don't look up and don't look down  
You  
don't das make the boss man frown  
Bend your knees and bow your head  
And pull that rope until your  
dead  
  
Let me go 'way from the Mississippi  
Let me go 'way from the white man boss  
Show me that stream  
called the River Jordan  
That's the old stream that I long to cross.  
  
Ol' Man River, that Ol' Man River  
  
He don't say nothin', but he must know somethin'  
He just keeps rollin', he keeps on rollin' along  
  
He  
don't plant tatters, and he don't plant cotton  
And them what plants em, are soon forgotten  
But Ol'  
Man River, just keeps rollin' along  
  
You and me, we sweat and strain  
Body all achin' and racked with  
pain  
Tote that barge and lift that bail  
You get a little drunk and you lands in jail  
  
I gets weary,  
and sick of trying  
I'm tired of livin', but I'm scared of dyin'  
But Ol' Man River, he just keeps

Alright  
Yeah  
  
Look at all the people, livin' on the street  
It don't seem they got nothin' to eat  
Children play with guns and they ain't toys  
What will become of all my girls and boys?  
  
It don't take brains to figure it out  
Everyday the newspaper headlines shout  
It's gonna take a miracle from above  
Either that just one drop of love  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love to make a new start  
(One)  
One drop of love everyone's heart  
  
I know  
I know  
I know  
  
It's getting harder everyday to make ends meet  
When you do, it's hard to stay on your feet  
Who are your real friends? You can't keep track  
While you're wathin' you front, you're gettin' stapped in the bag  
  
I ain't no genius but I know  
There's only one way to make this hatred go  
People, I tried it, now I'm beggin' you  
(Just)  
Reach in your heart and give up one drop too  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love to make a new start  
(One)  
One drop of love everyone's heart  
  
One drop of love, will plant a seed  
Maybe everyone will follow our lead  
Then they'll see, one drop can grow  
'Cause wilt enough drops a whole river flows  
A whole river flows from one drop of love  
  
(One drop of love)  
Yeah  
(One drop of love)  
Hmm  
(One drop of love)  
Ye, one drop, aha  
  
I ain't no genius but I know  
There's only one way to make this hatred go  
People, I tried it, now I'm beggin' you  
(Just)  
Reach in your heart and give up one drop too  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love to make a new start  
(One)  
One drop of love everyone's heart  
  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will make the world alright  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love will unite black and white  
(One drop of love)  
One drop of love to make a new start  
(One)  
One drop of love everyone's heart  
  
One drop of love, one drop of love

One early morning, as I was walking  
I met a woman, we started talking  
I took her home, to get a few nips  
But all I had was a mint julep  
  
I don't remember just how I started  
I only know that we should have parted  
I stole a kiss, and then another  
I didn't mean to take it further  
  
One mint julep was the cause of it all  
The lights were burning low, there in the parlor  
When through the kitchen door, up popped her father  
He said "I saw you when you kissed my daughter  
Better wed her right now, or face a slaughter!"  
  
I didn't know just what I was doing  
I had to marry of face ruin  
  
A mint julep, a mint julep  
A mint julep, a mint julep  
One mint julep was the cause of it all  
  
Now, I don't want to bore you with my troubles  
But from now on I?ll be thinking double  
I'm through with flirting and drinking whiskey  
I got six extra children from a-getting frisky  
  
A mint julep, a mint julep  
A mint julep, a mint julep  
One mint julep was the cause of it all

Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream,  
Really do come true.  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
High above the chimney tops,  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, way up high  
There's a land that I've heard of once in a lullaby.  
Somewhere over the rainbow, skies are blue  
And the dreams that you dare to dream,  
Really do come true.  
  
Someday I'll wish upon a star  
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me.  
Where troubles melt like lemon drops,  
High above the chimney tops,  
That's where you'll find me.  
  
Somewhere over the rainbow, blue birds fly  
Birds fly over the rainbow  
Why then, oh why can't I?  
If happy little bluebirds fly beyond the rainbow  
Why, oh why can't I?

Why do they think up stories that link my name with yours?  
Why do the neighbors chatter all day, behind their doors?  
I know a way to prove what they say is quite untrue.  
Here is the gist, a practical list of "donts" for you.  
  
Don't throw bouquets at me  
Don't please my folks too much  
Don't laugh at my jokes too much  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't sigh and gaze at me  
Your sighs are so like mine  
Your eyes mustn't glow like mine  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't start collecting things  
Give me my rose and my glove.  
Sweetheart they're suspecting things  
People will say we're in love.  
  
Don't praise my charm too much  
Don't look so vain with me  
Don't stand in the rain with me  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't take my arm too much  
Don't keep your hand in mine  
Your hand feels so grand in mine  
People will say we're in love!  
  
Don't dance all night with me  
Till the stars fade from above.  
They'll see it's alright with me  
People will say we're in love.

You say you're leaving me  
For someone new  
Please say you're teasing me  
Say it's not true  
  
Say it, come on  
And say you're fooling  
Whoa, say it's a lie  
Whoa, say you're fooling me, baby  
Don't say goodbye  
  
Whoa, if our romance is really done  
Don't you know my heart  
Will never see the sun  
  
To me, you're everything  
That is sweet and divine  
Don't keep me wandering, baby  
If you're still me  
  
Say it, come on  
And say you're foolong  
Whoa, say it's a lie  
Whoa, say you're fooling me, baby  
Whoa, don't say goodbye  
(Don't say goodbye)

[Dee Dee:]  
They can go away  
Isn't it strange you always leaving things  
Never mind I know this rule is not a whole  
I hope I made you feel less alone  
Think of me while you roam  
  
[Ray Charles:]  
It is no strange  
But it's more, more than just a night of fame  
There are things I believe should never be told, girl no  
But you're the only one I want to hold  
Cause it can get off the cold  
  
[Dee Dee:]  
Precious thing  
You know I love you  
You're such a wonderful thing  
You make me dizzy whispering in my ear  
Send my love to the next, somewhere  
  
[Ray Charles:]  
Ain't it funny, right  
I'm always losing things  
But you're like me you've known roaming  
I hope I made you feel less alone  
Think of me as you roam  
  
[Both:]  
Oh, precious thing  
You know I love you  
You're such a wonderful thing  
Girl, you make me dizzy whispering in my ear  
You my love, till the next, somewhere  
  
[Dee Dee:]  
Say no strength of freedom  
Is still as much yours as my thing  
I know promises can be hard to keep  
The price I pay to let, oh baby  
Was just to steal to steal my love from thee  
  
[Both:]  
Precious thing  
You know I love you  
You're such a wonderful thing  
You make me dizzy whispering in my ear  
Feel my love, till the next, somewhere

Hoverin' by my suitcase, tryin' to find a warm place to spend the night  
Heavy rain fallin', seems I hear your voice callin' "It's all right."  
A rainy night in Georgia, a rainy night in Georgia  
It seems like it's rainin' all over the world  
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world  
  
Neon signs a-flashin', taxi cabs and buses passin' through the night  
A distant moanin' of a train seems to play a sad refrain to the night  
A rainy night in Georgia, such a rainy night in Georgia  
Lord, I believe it's rainin' all over the world  
I feel like it's rainin' all over the world  
  
How many times I wondered  
It still comes out the same  
No matter how you look at it or think of it  
It's life and you just got to play the game  
  
I find me a place in a box car, so I take my guitar to pass some time  
Late at night when it's hard to rest I hold your picture to my chest and I
feel fine  
(minor scat) But it's a rainy night in Georgia, baby, it's a rainy night in
Georgia I  
Feel it's rainin' all over the world, kinda lonely now And it's rainin' all
over the  
World  
  
Oh, have you ever been lonely, people?  
And you feel that it was rainin' all over this man's world  
You're talking 'bout rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin', rainin',
rainin',  
Rainin', rainin' rainin', rainin', rainin'

Well, have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes  
Just about the break of day  
Well, have you ever woke up in the morning sometimes  
Just about the break of day  
  
Reach over and feel the pillow, baby  
Where your sweet man used to lay  
  
Well baby, it's so lonesome by myself  
Well, it's so lonesome, baby, just sleeping all by myself  
Well, I don't want nobody but my baby  
Shouting, my baby's loving somebody else  
  
Oh baby, won't you please hear my plea?  
Hallelujah, I said, oh, oh baby, won't you please hear my plea?  
Well, wherever you may be, darling  
Bring your fine self home to me

Went to see my sweetheart  
Last night around about ten  
She said, "Home sweet, Papa"  
Squeeze me every now and then  
  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way  
  
We went out to a movie  
Stop in the very last row  
We hadn't been there a good five minutes  
Before she's ready to go  
  
I had to roll with my baby  
I had to roll with my baby  
I had to roll with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way  
  
I've got a quarter, a nickel and a dime  
Can't buy me no whiskey  
I guess I'll have to settle for wine  
And then I can  
  
Roll with my baby  
I know I can roll with my baby  
I'm sure I can roll with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way  
  
She's such a sweet woman  
I'll never let her go  
'Cause deep down inside of me  
Lord knows I love her so  
  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
I'll keep rolling with my baby  
'Cause she's sweet that way

They say, Ruby you're like a dream  
Not always what you seem  
And though my heart may break when I awake  
Let it be so  
I only know, Ruby, it's you  
  
They say, Ruby you're like a song  
You don't know right from wrong  
And in your eyes I see heart aches for me  
But from the start, who stole my heart?  
Ruby, it's you  
I hear your voice and I must come to you  
I have no choice what else can I do?  
  
They say, Ruby you're like a flame  
Into my life you came  
And though I should beware  
Still I don't care you thrill me so  

I just came back from a lovely trip along the Milky Way  
Stopped off at the North Pole to spend a holiday  
I called on dear old Santa Claus  
To see what I could see  
He took me to his workshop  
And told his plans to me, so  
  
[Chorus]  
You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He's making a list and checking it twice  
Gonna find out who's naughty and nice  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
He sees you when you're sleepin'  
He knows when you're a wake  
He knows if you've been bad or good  
So be good for goodness sake  
Oh! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
  
Now Santa is a busy man, He has no time to play  
He's got millions of stockings to fill on Christmas day  
You'd better write your letter now  
And mail it right away  
Because he's getting ready  
His reindeer's and his sleigh. So  
  
[Chorus]  
  
With little tin horns and little toy drums  
Rooty toot toots and rummy tum tums  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
And curly head dolls that toddle and coo  
Elephants, boats, and kiddie cars too  
Santa Claus is comin' to town  
Then kids in Girl and Boy land will have a jubilee  
They're gonna build a Toyland all around the Christmas tree  
So! You better watch out, you better not cry  
Better not pout, I'm telling you why  
Santa Claus is comin' to town

Say no more  
I think you'll never understand  
I have refused the same demand  
All my life  
  
Say no more  
In my book there can be no blame  
When you pretend I have no shame  
You're half right  
  
All along  
You kept trying to pin me down  
Turn me into your house clown  
If I don't fit the bill  
All the same  
I loved you then  
I love you still  
  
[Chorus: ]  
Want to know the truth?  
I caught a nasty bug  
And when it got a hold of me  
I could not shake it free  
A lasting blue note  
Has been haunting me  
It's like an old mistress  
Forever chasing me...  
  
But say no more  
I may not be an easy man  
But the way you played your hand  
I couldn't stand  
  
It's too bad  
There is much more we could have done  
But now those days are dead and gone  
Nothing lasts  
  
All along  
You made me feel this useless guilt  
Can you look back on what we built?  
I wonder what you saw in me  
Tell me, was it real?  
Was it love?  
You tell me...  
  
[Chorus: ]  
  
And though you think of it  
As the cause of my fall  
Never mind, I'm blessed, I'm here, at all

He looked down into her brown eyes  
Said, " Say a prayer for me"  
She threw her arms around him  
Whispered, "God will keep us free"  
And they could hear the riders comin  
He said, "This is my last fight  
If they take me back to Texas  
They won't take me back alive"  
  
[Chorus]  
And there were seven spanish angels  
At the altar of the sun  
They were prayin' for the lovers  
In the valley of the gun  
And when the battle stopped  
And the smoke cleared  
There was thunder from the throne  
And seven spanish angels  
Took another angel home  
  
She reached down and picked the gun up  
That lay smokin' in his hand  
Said, "Father please forgive me  
I can't make it without my man"  
And she knew the gun was empty  
And she knew she couldn't win  
But her final prayer was answered  
When the rifles fired again  
  
[Chorus]

Sherry, Sherry baby  
Sherry, Sherry baby  
Sherry baby (Sherry baby)  
Sherry can you come out tonight  
(Come,come, come out tonight)  
Sherry baby (Sherry baby)  
Sherry can you come out tonight  
(Why don't you come out) To my twist party  
(Come out) Where the bright moon shines  
(Come out) We'll dance the night away  
I'm gonna make you mine  
Sherry baby (Sherry baby)  
Sherry can you come out tonight  
(Come, come, come out tonight)  
You better ask your Mama (Sherry baby)  
Tell her everything is alright  
(Why don't you come out) With your red dress on  
(Come out) Mmm you look so fine  
(Comeout) Move it nice and easy  
Girl, you make me lose my mind  
repeat to fade Sherry, sherry baby  
  

If you beg a date  
She says, "You're too late"  
Then later, she gives you a call  
Don't hesitate, you're in for a break  
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball  
  
If she winks at you  
Don't you miss that cue  
For this is no time for a stall  
Man, call a hack, and get to your shack  
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball  
  
No use in her denying  
You don't have to do much trying  
Just remember this, when she gives you her kiss  
Her heart, and soul, are pining  
  
So remember Gates  
It's never too late  
If ever she starts 'n to stall  
Just bait your trap, she'll fall just like that  
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball  
  
No use in her denying  
You don't have to do much trying  
'Cause remember this, if she gives you her kiss  
Her heart, and soul, are pining  
  
So remember-gate  
It's never too late  
Whenever she starts 'n to stall  
Just bait your trap, she'll fall just like that  
'Cause Jack, she's on the ball  
Mm, Jack, she's on the ball  
(I'm tellin' you buddy)  
Jack, she's on the ball  
(Of course, if she's fine it's understood that)  
Jack, she's on the ball

Pick me a town  
In any clime  
Where people like  
A rockin time  
And stay awake  
Both day and night  
Till everybody's feelin good an' right

Ahhhhh, smack dab in the middle, boys now  
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

A ten room house  
Some Bar be Q  
And fifty chicks not over twenty-two  
Then throw me

Ahhhhh, now boys you can see why I want to be smack dab in the middle now  
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul

of bonds and stocks  
Then open up the door at Fort Knox  
Then throw me

Ahhhhh, now listen boys throw me smack dab in the middle right now

Oodles of butter and somethin sweet  
Gallons of coffee to wash it down  
Bicarbonated soda by the pound  
Then throw me

I picture it  
(Smack dab in the middle)  
Ahhhhh, throw me now, smack dab in the middle right now  
So I can rock and roll to satisfy my soul  
Alright!

So Help Me God  
By Ray Charles  
  
I am lost, I've been led astray  
Once again I need Your light and love to lead the way  
I know I don't deserve it, but I promise it's the end  
So if You rescue me just one more time  
You'll never have to do it again  
  
So help me God  
So help me God  
Help me... God  
Help me God  
Help me God  
Ooh...  
  
It's the truth, I can't tell You a lie  
You're the only one who's been there for me each and every time  
Now I guess it's my turn to prove myself to You  
Go ahead, ask me anything at all  
And that's what I am going to do  
  
So help me God (help me God)  
Help me God (please help me)  
Help me... God (God! )  
I cross my heart (help me... God)  
Help me God, oh yeah (ooh...)  
  
You've been so understanding and patient with me  
It's took me some time, but now I see (but now I see)  
It took me some time, but now I see...  
  
I am awake, now I have been found  
You can count on me forever more  
I'm never gonna' let You down  
  
So help me God (help me God)  
Yes please, God (please help me)  
Help me... (God! ) God

I won't let you down... (oh no! )  
Please (help me) help me God  
(Help me God! Help me...)  
Help me God... My Lord.

What have I got to do to make you love me  
What have I got to do to make you care  
What do I do when lightning strikes me  
And I wake to find that you're not there  
  
What do I do to make you want me  
What have I got to do to be heard  
What do I say when it's all over  
And sorry seems to be the hardest word  
  
It's sad, so sad  
It's a sad, sad situation  
And it's getting more and more absurd  
It's sad, so sad  
Why can't we talk it over  
Oh it seems to me  
That sorry seems to be the hardest word  
  
What do I do to make you love me  
What have I got to do to be heard  
What do I do when lightning strikes me  
What have I got to do  
What have I got to do  
When sorry seems to be the hardest word

The song a robin sings  
Through years of endless springs  
The murmur of a brook at evening tide  
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide  
  
That great symphonic theme  
That's Stella by starlight  
And not a dream  
My heart and I agree  
She's everything on Earth to me  
  
The murmur of a brook at evening tide  
That ripples by a nook where two lovers hide  
  
That great symphonic theme  
That's Stella by starlight  
And not a dream  
My heart and I agree  
She's everything on Earth to me

I met my old lover  
On the street last night  
She seemed so glad to see me  
I just smiled  
And we talked about some old times  
And we drank ourselves some beers  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
I'm not the kind of man  
Who tends to socialize  
I seem to lean on  
Old familiar ways  
And I ain't no fool for love songs  
That whisper in my ears  
Still crazy after all these years  
Still crazy after all these years  
  
Four in the morning  
Crapped out  
Yawning  
Longing my life away  
I'll never worry  
Why should l?  
Its all gonna fade  
  
Now I sit by my window  
And I watch the cars  
I fear I'll do some damage  
One fine day  
But I would not be convicted  
By a jury of my peers  
Still crazy  
Still crazy  
Still crazy after all these years

As I sit around, watchin' the rain come down  
It puts me in the mood  
It reminds me of, the first time I met you, girl  
And I hear the rain on the windowpane  
And it brings back memories  
Of the love we made  
And the things that we used to do  
Yes, and I recall the thrill of it all  
When the heat had just begun  
Everything was fine, nothing never did go wrong  
  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didn't know what to do  
After lovin' you  
And I couldn't get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
And I' m still missing you a lot  
So when I hear rain, it just brings back pain  
You gave the best love I ever had  
It's a doggone shame, 'cause it sure felt good to me  
Sometimes I wonder, where did you disappear to  
How did you get away, baby  
And I often think of you  
Do you ever think of me, baby  
Sometimes love don't work, the way you think it should  
When your love jones comes on down, baby  
But baby I still care and I think that I always will  
  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
From the very start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
Then you broke my heart  
I didn't know how to act  
After your bags were packed  
And I couldn't get a real good start  
We had a strong love affair, strong love affair, baby  
And I'm still lovin' you a lot, oh well

You can haunt any house by yourself  
Be a man or a mouse by yourself  
You can act like a king on a thrown  
There are lots of things that you can do alone

Two to really get the feeling of romance

Up in the mornin'  
Out on the job  
Work like the devil for my pay  
But that lucky old sun got nothin' to do  
But roll around heaven all day.  
  
Fuss with my woman, toil for my kids  
Sweat till I'm wrinkled and gray  
While that lucky old sun got nothin' to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Dear Lord above, can't you know I'm pining, tears all in my eyes  
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise  
  
Show me that river, take me across  
Wash all my troubles away  
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do  
But roll around heaven all day  
  
Send down that cloud with a silver lining, lift me to Paradise  
Show me that river, take me across  
Wash all my troubles away  
Like that lucky old sun, give me nothing to do  
But roll around heaven all day
