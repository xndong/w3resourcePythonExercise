I get in from work at 2a.m.  
And sit down with a beer  
Turn on the late night t.v.  
And then wonder why I'm here  
It's meaningless and trivial  
And it washes over me  
And once again I wonder  
Is this all there is for me  
  
Here I am again  
Look at me again  
Here I am again  
On my own  
Trying hard to see  
What there is for me  
Here I am again  
On my own  
  
Life seems so pathetic  
I wish I could live it all behind  
This canvas chair, this bed,  
These walls that fall in on my mind  
Hold on for something better  
That just drags you trough the dirt  
Do you just let go or carry on  
And try to take the hurt

Kill for gain or shoot to maim  
But we don't need a reason  
The Golden Goose is on the loose  
And never out of season  
Some blackened pride still burns inside  
This shell of bloody treason  
Here's my gun for a barrel of fun  
For the love of living death.  
  
[Chorus]  
The killer's breed or the demon's seed,  
The glamour, the fortune, the pain,  
Go to war again, blood is freedom's stain,  
But don't you pray for my soul anymore.  
Two minutes to midnight  
The hands that threaten doom.  
Two minutes to midnight  
To kill the unborn in the womb.  
  
The blind men shout let the creatures out  
We'll show the unbelievers  
The napalm screams of human flames  
Of a prime time Belsen feast, yeah!  
As the reasons for the carnage cut their meat and lick the gravy,  
We oil the jaws of the war machine and feed it with our babies.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The body bags and little rags of children torn in two  
And the jellied brains of those who remain to put the finger right on you.  
As the madmen play on words and make us all dance to their song,  
To the tune of starving millions to make a better kind of gun.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Midnight, all night

Lying awake at night I wipe the sweat  
From my brow  
But it's not the fear 'cause  
I'd rather go now  
  
Trying to visualize the horrors that  
Will lay ahead  
The desert sand mound a burial ground  
  
When it comes to the time  
Are we partners in crime?  
When it comes to the time  
We'll be ready to die  
  
God let us go now and finish what's  
To be done  
Thy Kingdom Come  
Thy shall be done, on earth  
  
Trying to justify to ourselves the  
Reasons to go  
Should we live and let live  
Forget or forgive  
  
But how can we let them go on this way?  
The reign of terror corruption must end  
And we know deep down there's  
No other way  
No trust, no reasoning, no more to say  
  
Afraid to shoot strangers  
Afraid to shoot strangers

"My son ask for thyself another  
Kingdom, for that which I leave  
is too small for thee"  
(King Philip of Macedonia - 339 B.C.)  
  
Near to the east  
In a part of ancient Greece  
In an ancient land called Macedonia  
Was born a son  
To Philip of Macedon  
The legend his name was Alexander  
  
At the age of nineteen  
He became the Macedon King  
And he swore to free all of Asia Minor  
By the Aegian Sea  
In 334 B.C.  
He utterly beat the armies of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a legend 'mongst mortal men  
  
King Darius the third  
Defeated fled Persia  
The Scythians fell by the river Jaxartes  
Then Egypt fell to the Macedon King as well  
And he founded the city called Alexandria  
  
By the Tigris river  
He met King Darius again  
And crushed him again in the battle of Arbela  
Entering Babylon  
And Susa, treasures he found  
Took Persepolis the capital of Persia  
  
[Chorus]  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
Became a God amongst mortal men  
  
A Phrygian King had bound a chariot yoke  
And Alexander cut the 'Gordian knot'  
And legend said that who untied the knot  
He would become the master of Asia  
  
Helonism he spread far and wide  
The Macedonian learned mind  
Their culture was a western way of life  
He paved the way for Christianity  
  
Marching on, marching on  
The battle weary marching side by side  
Alexander's army line by line  
They wouldn't follow him to India  
Tired of the combat, pain and the glory  
  
Alexander the Great  
His name struck fear into hearts of men  
Alexander the Great  
He died of fever in Babylon

Look inside your head and find, tell me now and it's all in your mind  
Look inside your head and find a way deep inside and it's all in your mind  
  
It's all in your mind  
It's all in your mind  
  
Revolution, air pollution, Chairman Mao Tse Tung is in your mind  
"But he's dead pal... He's not very well anyway..."  
A new day breaking-people hating  
Love's a dream and it's all in your mind  
  
Segregation, preservation, politicians all are in your mind  
Pewter suta, Karma Sutra, even Blanckenheimer's in your mind  
  
Yes...  
  
It's all in your mind  
It's all in your mind

As I lay here lying on my bed  
Sweet voices come into my head.  
Oh what it is, I want to know  
Please won't you tell me it's got to go.  
There's a feeling that's inside me  
Telling me to get away.  
But I'm so tired of living  
I might as well end today.  
  
As I lay here lying on my bed  
Sweet voices come into my head.  
Oh what it is, I want to know  
Please won't you tell me it's got to go.  
There's a feeling that's inside me  
Telling me to get away.  
But I'm so tired of living  
I might as well end today.  
  
As I lay here lying on my bed  
Sweet voices come into my head.  
Oh what it is, I want to know  
Please won't you tell me it's got to go.  
There's a feeling that's inside me  
Telling me to get away.  
But I'm so tired of living  
I might as well end today.

Turn the spotlights on the people,  
Switch the dial and eat the worm.  
Take your chances, kill the engine,  
Drop your bombs and let it burn.  
  
White flags shot to ribbons,  
The truce is black and burned,  
Shellshock in the kitchen,  
Tables overturned.  
  
[Chorus]  
Back in the village again,  
In the village.  
I'm back in the village again.  
  
Throwing dice now, rolling loaded,  
I see sixes all the way.  
In a black hole, and I'm spinning  
As my wings get shot away.  
  
No breaks on the inside,  
Paper cats and burning barns,  
There's a fox among the chickens,  
And a killer in the hounds.  
  
Questions are a burden  
And answers are a prison for oneself  
Shellshock in the kitchen  
Tables start to burn.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But still we walk into the valley  
And others try to kill the inner flame  
We're burning brighter than before  
I don't have a number, I'M A NAME!  
  
[Chorus]

Covered in sinners and dripping  
With gilt  
Making you money from slime  
And from filth  
Parading your bellies in ivory towers  
Investing our lives in your schemes  
And your powers  
  
You got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
You've got to watch them  
Be quick  
Or be dead  
Snake eyes in heaven  
The thief  
In your head  
Be quick!  
Or be dead!  
Be quick!  
Or be dead  
  
See, what's ruling all our lives  
See, who's pulling the strings,  
I bet you won't fall on your face,  
Your belly will hold you in place  
  
The serpent is crawling inside of  
Your ear  
He says you must vote for what you  
Want to hear  
Don't matter what's wrong as long as you're  
Alright  
So pull yourself stupid and rob  
Yourself blind

Sometimes it makes me wonder  
Sometimes it makes me question  
Sometimes it makes me saddened  
Always it makes me angry but  
  
When you can see it happening  
The madness that's all around you  
Nobody seems to worry  
The World seems so powerless to act  
  
It's out of control  
Blood on The World's hands  
Each day a new toll  
  
Another assassination  
The same day a new creation  
But what are they coming into  
Security of a world that brings  
  
One day another killing  
Somewhere there's someone starving  
Another a savage raping  
Meanwhile there's someone laughing at us  
  
It's out of control  
Blood on The World's hands  
Each day it goes on  
  
Brutality and aggression  
Tomorrow another lesson  
Expecting another air raid  
Praying for a ceasefire  
  
They say things are getting better  
No need to be complacent  
There's chaos across the border  
And one day it could be happening to us  
  
It's out of control  
Blood in The World's hands  
It's our epitaph  
It's out of control  
Someone should know  
Blood on The World's hands  
  
Someone should

Honey its getting close to midnight, and all the myths are still in town  
True love and lipstick on your linen, bite the pillow make no sound  
If there's some living to be done before your life becomes your tomb  
You'd better know that I'm the one, so unchain your back door invite me around  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Let her go, yeah!  
Honey its getting close to daybreak, the sun is creeping in the sky  
No patent remedies for heartache, just empty words and humble pie  
So get down on your knees honey, assume an attitude  
You just pray that I'll be waiting cos you know I'm coming soon  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
  
So pick up your foolish pride, no going back  
No where, no way, no place to hide  
  
(2:24-Solo: Janick Gers)  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter  
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter  
Bring your daughter, fetch your daughter to the slaughter  
  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go  
Bring your daughter, bring your daughter to the slaughter  
Let her go, let her go, let her go

So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again  
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men  
There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free  
And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me  
  
There's things in life now, baby, that I know I've got to do  
And I need your love now, baby, to help me see it through  
So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again  
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men  
  
So you think you can own me, well you'd better just think again  
You'd better watch your steps now, woman, cause I ain't like those other men  
There's something burning inside me that makes me want to be free  
And when I get these feelings honey, you better keep away from me

Can I play with madness?  
  
Give me the sense to wonder  
To wonder if I'm free  
Give me a sense of wonder  
To know I can be me  
Give me the strength to hold my head up  
Spit back in their face  
Don't need no key to unlock this door  
Gonna break down the walls  
Break out of this bad place  
  
[Chorus]  
Can I play with madness?  
The prophet stared at his crystal ball  
Can I play with madness?  
There's no vision there at all  
Can I play with madness?  
The prophet looked at me and laughed at me (ha ha) He said:  
Can I play with madness?  
He said you're blind, too blind to see  
  
Said you're too blind to see  
  
I screamed aloud to the old man  
I said don't lie, don't say you don't know  
I say you'll pay for this mischief  
In this world or the next  
Oh and then he fixed me with a freezing glance  
And the hell fires raged in his eyes  
He said you wanna know the truth son?  
Lord, I'll tell you the truth  
Your soul's gonna burn in a lake of fire  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Listen to me, said the prophet  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Can I play with madness?

If you had the time to lose,  
An open mind and time to choose,  
Would you care to take a look,  
Or can you read me like a book?  
  
Time is always on my side,  
Time is always on my side.  
  
Can I tempt you, come with me,  
Be Devil may care, fulfill your dream,  
If I said I'd take you there,  
Would you go, would you be scared?  
  
Time is always on my side,  
Time is always on my side.  
  
Don't be afraid, you're safe with me,  
Safe as any soul can be, honestly,  
Just let yourself go.  
  
[Chorus]  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught somewhere in time, oh oh  
  
Like a wolf in sheep's clothing,  
You try to hide your deepest sins,  
Of all the things that you've done wrong,  
And I know where you belong.  
  
Time is always on my side,  
Time is always on my side.  
  
Make you an offer you can't refuse,  
You've only got your soul to lose  
Eternally  
Just let yourself go!  
  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught somewhere in time  
Caught now in two minds!

There's a madman in the corner of  
Your eye  
He likes to pry, into your sunlight  
He wants to burst into the street  
With you and I  
A world of shadows and of rain  
He's seen what love is  
He wants to pay you back with guilt  
  
He lies to you he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned your key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
There's a prophet in the gutter  
In the street  
He say "you're damned!"  
And you believe him  
He's got a vision but it shines out  
Through your eyes  
A world of hatred and fear  
He's felt what love means  
He wants to pay you back with pain  
  
He lies to you, he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
It's only love that holds the key to  
Our hearts  
It's only love  
  
He lies to you he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery  
  
He lies to you he won't let you be  
He's got your chains of misery  
He won't be still till he's turned the key  
He holds your chains of misery

Giving a swish with your ass in the air, don't you know what they're saying?  
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.  
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?  
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?  
  
[Chorus]  
Charlotte the Harlot show me your legs,  
Charlotte the Harlot take me to bed.  
Charlotte the Harlot let me see blood,  
Charlotte the Harlot let me see love.  
  
Taking so many men to your room, don't you feel no remorse?  
You charge them a "fiver", It's only for starters.  
And ten for the main course.  
And you've got no feelings, they died long ago.  
Don't you care who you let in?  
And don't you know you're breaking the law with the service you're giving.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There was a time when you left me standing there,  
Picking up pieces of love off the floor.  
Well Charlotte you left me alone in there,  
To make your ends as a bloody whore.  
Well Charlotte you told me you love me true,  
Picking up pieces of love yesterday.  
Well Charlotte you're draws are off color too  
'Cause you're making love all day.  
  
Giving a swish with your ass in the air, don't you know what they're saying?  
Charlotte you're so refined when you take all the love that they're giving.  
Sticking with every man that you find, don't you know what they're after?  
Charlotte you've got your legs in the air, don't you hear all the laughter?  
  
[Chorus]

I'd sail across the ocean  
I'd walk a hundred miles  
If I could make it to the end  
Oh just to see a smile  
  
You see it in their faces  
The sadness in their tears  
The desperation and the anger  
Madness and the fear  
  
No hope, no life, just pain and fear  
No food, no love, just greed is here  
  
Starvation and the hunger  
The suffering and the pain  
The agonies of all-out war  
When will it come again?  
  
The struggle for the power  
A tyrant tries again  
Just what the hell is going on?  
When will it ever end?  
  
No hope, no life, just pain and fear  
No food, no love, just greed is here  
  
You see the full moon float  
You watch the red sun rise  
We take these things for granted  
But somewhere someone's dying  
  
Contaminated waters  
Pollution and decay  
Just waiting for disease to strike  
Oh will we learn someday?  
  
No hope, no life, just pain and fear  
No food, no love, no seed  
Childhood's end

(Harris)  
  
He's walking like a small child  
But watch his eyes burn you away  
Black holes in his golden stare  
God knows he wants to go home  
Children of The Damned  
(repeat another 3 times)  
  
He's walking like a dead man  
If he had lived he would have crucified us all  
Now he's standing on his last stand  
He thought oblivion well it beckons us all  
Children of The Damned  
(repeat another 3 times)  
  
Now it burns his hand he's turning to laugh  
Smiles as the flame sears his flesh  
Melting his face screaming in pain  
Peeling the skin from his eyes  
Watch him die according to plan  
He's dust on the ground what did we learn  
  
You're Children of The Damned  
Your back's against the wall  
You turn into the light  
You're burning in the night  
You're Children of The Damned  
Like candles watch them burn  
Burning in the light  
You'll burn again tonight  
You're Children of The Damned

We shall go on to the end.  
We shall fight in France  
We shall fight over the seas and oceans.  
We shall fight with growing confidence and growing strength in the air.  
We shall defend our island whatever the cost may be  
We shall fight on beaches, we shall fight on the landing grounds,  
We shall fight in the fields and in the streets,  
We shall fight on the hills.  
We shall never surrender.

Como esta amigo  
For the death of those we don't go  
Shall we kneel and say a prayer  
They will never know we care  
Shall we keep the fires burning  
Shall we keep the flames alight  
Should we try to remember  
What is wrong and what is right  
  
No more tears, no more tears  
If we live for a hundred years  
Amigos no more tears  
  
And if we do forget them  
and the sacrifice they made  
Will the wickedness and sadness  
come to visit us again  
Shall we dance the dance in sunlight  
Shall we drink the wine of peace  
Shall our tears be of joy  
Shall we keep at bay the beast  
  
Inside the scream is silent  
Inside it must remain  
No victory and no vanquished  
Only horror, only pain

Let me tell you a story to chill the bones  
About a thing that I saw  
One night wandering in the everglades  
I'd one drink but no more  
  
I was rambling, enjoying the bright moonlight  
Gazing up at the stars  
Not aware of a presence so near to me  
Watching my every move  
  
Feeling scared and I fell to my knees  
As something rushed me from the trees  
Took me to an unholy place  
And that is where I fell from grace  
  
Then they summoned me over to join in with them  
To the dance of the dead  
Into the circle of fire I followed them  
Into the middle I was led  
  
As if time had stopped still I was numb with fear  
But still I wanted to go  
And the blaze of the fire did no hurt upon me  
As I walked onto the coals  
  
And I felt I was in a trance  
And my spirit was lifted from me  
And if only someone had the chance  
To witness what happened to me  
  
And I danced and I pranced and I sang with them  
All had death in their eyes  
Lifeless figures they were undead all of them  
They had ascended from hell  
  
As I danced with the dead  
My free spirit was laughing and howling down at me  
Below my undead body  
Just danced the circle of dead  
  
Until the time came to reunite us both  
My spirit came back down to me  
I didn't know if I was alive or dead  
As the others all joined in with me  
  
By luck then a skirmish started  
And took the attention away from me  
When they took their gaze from me  
Was the moment that I fled  
  
I ran like hell faster than the wind  
But behind I did not glance  
One thing that I did not dare  
Was to look just straight ahead  
  
When you know that your time has come around  
You know you'll be prepared for it  
Say your last goodbyes to everyone  
Drink and say a prayer for it  
  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
When you're lying in your sleep, when you're lying in your bed  
And you wake from your dreams to go dancing with the dead  
  
To this day I guess I'll never know  
Just why they let me go  
But I'll never go dancing no more  
'Til I dance with the dead

When you see familiar faces,  
But you don't remember where they're from,  
Could you be wrong?  
When you've been particular places,  
That you know you've never been before,  
Can you be sure?  
'Cause you know this has happened before,  
And you know that this moment in time is for real,  
And you know when you feel Deja vu.  
  
Chorus:[Chorus]  
Feel like I've been here before,  
Feel like I've been here before.  
  
Ever had a conversation,  
That you realize you've had before,  
Isn't it strange?  
Have you ever talked to someone,  
And you feel you know what's coming next?  
It feels pre-arranged.  
'Cause you know that you've heard it before,  
And you feel that this moment in time is surreal,  
'Cause you know when you feel deja-vu.

Another prophet of disaster  
Who says the ship is lost  
Another prophet of disaster  
Leaving you to count the cost  
Taunting us with visions  
Afflicting us with fear  
Predicting war for millions  
In the hope that one appears  
  
No point asking when it is  
No point asking who's to go  
No point asking what's the game  
No point asking who's to blame  
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,  
if you're gonna die  
  
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on  
If you're gonna try, well stick around  
Gonna cry, just move along  
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die  
  
In thirteen the beast is rising  
The Frenchman did surmise  
Through earthquakes and starvation  
The warlord will arise  
Terror, death, destruction  
Pour from the eastern sands  
But the truth of all predictions  
Is always in your hands  
  
No point asking when it is  
No point asking who's to go  
No point asking what's the game  
No point asking who's to blame  
'Cause if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die  
if you're gonna die, if you're gonna die,  
if you're gonna die  
  
If you're gonna die, die with your boots on  
If you're gonna try, just stick around  
Gonna cry, just move along  
If you're gonna die, you're gonna die

You lead me on the path  
Keep showing me the way  
I feel a little lost  
A little strange today  
  
I think I'll take a hold  
Of whatever comes my way  
Then we'll see what happens  
Take it day by day  
  
I thought I had it all  
I had it all worked out  
Just what my future held  
That there would be no doubt  
  
But then the card came up  
And I took another turn  
But I don't know if it's  
Fulfillment that I yearn  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
To view the world  
  
I would like you to know  
When you see the simple things  
To appreciate this life  
It's not too late to learn  
  
Don't want to be here  
Somewhere I'd rather be  
But when I get there  
I might find it's not for me  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
To view the world  
  
I would like you to know  
When you see the simple things  
To appreciate this life  
It's not too late to learn  
  
Tell me what you can hear  
And then tell me what you see  
Everybody has a different way  
  
to view the world  
I would like you to know  
When you see the simple things  
To appreciate this life  
It's not too late to learn  
  
Don't wanna be here  
Somewhere I'd rather be  
But when I get there  
I might find it's not for me  
  
Don't know what I want  
Or where I want to be  
I'm feeling more confused  
The more the days go by

Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Don't look trough the eyes of a fool  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebody's watching when the light goes down  
  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Don't look trough the eyes of a fool  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebody's watching when the night comes down  
  
Feel someone's watching you  
You gotta get away  
Is it the first time  
You've ever felt this scared  
  
Feel the adrenaline pump  
Your heart begins to race  
Begin to run now  
The sweat runs down your face  
  
Don't know which way to turn  
You'd better hide yourself  
He's getting closer now  
You'd better improvise  
  
Just hope you never reach  
The point of no return  
Could be the last time  
You see the light of day  
  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Don't look trough the eyes of a fool  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebody's watching when the night goes down  
  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Don't look trough the eyes of a fool  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebody's watching when the light goes down  
  
Don't look to, Don't look to  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Don't look through the eyes of a fool  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger  
Somebody's watching when the light goes down  
  
Don't look to the eyes of a stranger

Walk away!  
  
Look out now, baby won't you take me away,  
Sittin' here its gonna be a new day.  
Gotta sing my song and I can't go wrong,  
Gotta keep on roaming, gotta sing my song.  
  
What you feeling when you hold me tight?  
I'm gonna cuddle up with you tonight, gonna get you feeling so secure.  
listen child don't you see there's a cure?  
Anywhere got to get you away, feels so good think it's gonna be a new day.  
I'm gonna get my song till I can't go on,  
I'm gonna keep on roaming gonna sing my song.  
  
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.  
I want you to sing it, sing it, sing it, sing it along.

Gotta tell you a story  
On a cold winter's night  
You'll be sailin' for glory  
Before you know what is right  
  
So come over here now  
I got a vision for you  
It's my personal snake oil  
It's just something I do  
  
I'm the jester with no tears  
And I'm playing on your fears  
I'm a trickster smiling underneath this mask of love and death  
The eternal lie I've told  
About the pyramids of gold  
I've got you hooked at every turn your money's left to burn  
  
You'll be wanting a contract  
You'll be waiting a while  
I'd like to give you my contact  
But that isn't my style  
  
Well you only get one chance  
And it's too good to miss  
if i didn't lie to ya  
Then I wouldn't exist  
  
Greed, lust and anvy pride  
It's the same old, same old ride  
The smoke and mirrors visions that you see are just like me  
I'm a banker's face  
With just a letter out of place  
I know someone just like you knows someone just like me  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try  
  
So gone is the glory  
And gone is the gold  
Well if you knew the story  
How come, it has to be told  
  
Well you can say I'm a devil  
And I wouldn't say no  
But out here on the dark side  
Hey, on with the show  
  
So now my tale is told  
Big and bad and twice as bold  
This ship of fools is sinking as the cracks begin to grow  
There is no easy way  
For an honest man today  
Which is something you should think of as my lifeboat sails away  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try  
  
El Dorado come and play  
El Dorado step this way  
Take a ticket for the ride  
El Dorado streets of gold  
See my ship is oversold  
You've got one last chance to try

Why is it some of us are destined to stay alive  
And some of us are here just so that we'll die  
How come the bullet hits the other guy  
Do we have to try and reason why  
  
[Chorus]  
Be it the devil or be it him  
You can count on just one thing  
When the time is up you'll know  
Not just one power runs the show  
  
Are we the lucky ones saved for another day  
Or they the lucky ones who are taken away  
Is it a hand on your shoulder from the lord above  
Or the devil himself come to give you a shove  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A volcano erupts and sweeps a town away  
A hurricane devastates the cities in its way  
The grief and misery for the ones that are left behind  
The worst is yet to come a hell to face mankind

We live our lives in fever  
In a choking sweat of fear  
In the heat of the night you can  
Feel so much  
In the heat of the night I scream  
"Don't touch!"  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame  
  
We live in fever  
  
I hear your secret heartbeat  
I can hear your silent cries  
The kids have lost their freedom  
And nobody cares till somebody  
Famous dies  
  
I remember a time when we  
Used and abused  
And fought all our battles in vain  
I remember a time we thought that  
Passion was free  
In the heart of the night, bodies aflame  
  
Now we live, in a world of uncertainty  
Fear is the key, to what you want to be  
You don't get a say the majority  
Gets its way  
You're outnumbered by the bastards  
Till the day you die

The Vikings are coming  
You'd better get ready for we're having a fight  
The longboats are coming  
It's looking like their? in the dead of the night  
  
Muster the men from all the villages  
You'd better get ready to fight with your enemies  
  
Beacons are burning  
I'm giving the word to get ready to fight  
The battle is nearing  
You'd better get ready to fight for your lives  
  
The Norsemen are coming  
The Norsemen are coming  
The warnings are given  
The Norsemen are coming  
  
Raping and pillaging  
Robbing and looting the land  
  
Viking raiders from afar

Sitting, waiting in the falling rain  
Getting ready to begin again  
  
Wounded, lying, crying  
Bodies moving and dying  
All around there is the smell  
Of death and fire  
  
Here the planes are coming  
Hear the soldiers running  
Killing on a scale to comprehend  
  
Why are we here  
In this place... Here to kill  
Please God forgive us for  
What we have done  
  
I always thought I was doing right  
As of now I'm not feeling so sure  
  
I'm at a place of where  
I give no grace  
I'm a soldier of war  
  
I sit waiting for my darkest hour  
To come  
I cannot think about the things  
That I have done  
It shouldn't take a fool to see  
That I believe  
Accept the consequence  
Repent for what I've done  
  
You tell me what is certain  
But I'll tell you what is true  
You tell me that is honesty  
When all around is death and cruelty  
  
The making of a man is fire  
By giving in to our desires  
Within the truth that lies  
Within the only thing  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of death desire  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath of fire  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of pain  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath  
  
Some say you are a lost cause  
Some say you're a Saint  
Just being here's an act of  
Sufering and restraint  
  
Walk down the long dark road  
To ruin panic not  
I'll die a lonely death of that  
I'm certain of  
  
Rivers flow with blood  
There's nowhere left to hide  
It's hard to comprehend  
There's anyone left alive  
  
Sick of all the killing  
And the reek of death  
Will God tell me  
What religion is to man  
  
I don't hold with bad religion  
Understand what's underneath it  
Now I come to think of it  
I just don't hold at all you know it  
  
You say you are a holy man  
But what is it you do  
From where I stand is nothing  
But a hollow man I see  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of death desire  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath of fire  
  
Mother Of Mercy  
Angel of pain  
Mother Of Mercy  
Taking my last breath  
  
I'm just a lonely soldier fighting  
In a bloody hopeless war  
Don't know what I'm fighting  
Who it is or what I'm fighting for  
  
Though it was for money  
Make my fortune now I'm not  
So sure  
Seem to just have lost my way

I remember it as plain as day  
Although it happened in the dark of the night.  
I was strolling through the streets of Paris  
And it was cold it was starting to rain.  
And then I heard a piercing scream  
And I rushed to the scene of the crime  
But all I found was the butchered remains  
Of two girls lay side by side.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Run before the killers go free  
  
There's some people coming down the street  
At last there's someone heard my call  
I can't understand why they're pointing at me  
I never done nothing at all.  
But I must have got some blood on my hands  
Because everyone's shouting at me  
I can't speak French so I couldn't explain  
And like a fool I started running away.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free.  
  
And now I've gotta get away from the arms of the law.  
All France is looking for me.  
I've gotta find my way across the border for sure  
Down the south to Italy.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Someone call the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.  
  
Well I made it to the border at last  
But I can't erase the scene from my mind  
Anytime somebody stares at me, well  
I just start running blind  
Well I'm moving through the shadows at night  
Away from the staring eyes  
Any day they'll be looking for me  
'Cause I know I show the signs of...  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the arms of the law  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Running from the Gendarmes  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
Am I ever gonna be free  
  
It took so long and I'm getting so tired  
I'm running out of places to hide  
Should I return to the scene of the crime  
Where the two young victims died  
If I could go to somebody for help  
It'd get me out of trouble for sure  
But I know that it's on my mind  
That my doctor said I've done it before.  
  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
They're never gonna find me  
Murders in the Rue Morgue  
I'm never going home.

There's a darkened sky before me  
There's no time to prepare  
Salvage a last horizon  
But no regrets from me  
  
Maybe I'll be back some other day  
To live again just who can say  
In what shape or form that I might be  
Just another chance for me  
  
A hurried time no disgrace  
Instead of racing to conclusion  
And wishing all my life away  
No-one can stop me now  
  
Time is up it couldn't last  
But there's more things I'd like to do  
I'm coming back to try again  
Someday maybe I'll wait till then  
  
No more lies  
  
They're all sitting at my table  
Talking tall and drinking wine  
Their time is up just like me  
But they just don't know it yet  
  
So just a word of warning  
When you're in your deepest dreams  
There's nothing you can hide from  
I've got my eye on you  
  
The clock is fast, the hour is near  
Eventful past is ever clear  
My life is set, the time is here  
I think I'm coming home  
  
No more lies  
  
A hurried time, no disgrace  
Instead of racing to conclusions  
And wishing all your life away  
No-one can stop me now  
  
Time is up it couldn't last  
But there's more things I have to do  
I'm coming back to try again  
Don't tell me that this is the end  
  
No more lies

Hold a halo round the world  
Golden is the day  
Princes of the Universe,  
Your burden is the way  
So there is no better time,  
Who will be born today  
A gypsy child at the day break  
A King for a day  
  
[Chorus:]  
Out of the Shadow and into the sun  
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done  
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain  
But we must endure it to live again  
  
Dusty dreams in fading daylight  
Flicker on the walls  
Nothing new your life's adrift  
What purpose to it all?  
Eyes are closed and death is calling  
Reaching out its hand  
Call upon the starlight to surround you  
  
Out of the Shadow and into the sun  
Dreams of the past as the old ways are done  
Oh there is beauty and surely there is pain  
But we must endure it to live again  
  
[Chorus x3]  
  
A man who casts no shadow has no soul

Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
  
Weathered hands, withered bodies begging for salvation  
Deserted by the hand of gods of their own creation  
Nations cry underneath decaying skies above  
You are guilty, the punishment is death for all who live  
The punishment is death for all who live  
  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
  
The killing fields, the grinding wheels crushed by equilibrium.  
Separate lives, no more disguise, no more second chances.  
Haggard wisdom spitting out the bitter taste of hate.  
I accuse you before you know the crime it's all too late.  
Before you know the crime it's all too late.  
  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, come the demons of creation.  
  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent  
Planet we are.  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.  
  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
Out of the silent planet, dreams of desolation,  
Out of the silent planet, Come the demons of creation.  
  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are,  
Out of the silent planet, out of the silent planet we are.

I don't care  
They're crazy  
Said pass the jam, would you  
Awfully kind of you  
Now wouldn't it be a little bit nice to sing with this  
  
Gazing at the open door  
Just what lays behind  
Thinking what I'm looking for  
Say what's on my mind  
  
Sinking ever deeper  
In the words of guilt of shame  
And now I can redeem myself  
I just don't care  
  
The words I'm singing they're just right  
That's better for my brain  
If I try to make much sense  
You know I'll go insane  
  
I just don't care  
I just don't care  
  
Stay and have some jam with tea  
But Brutus wasn't kind  
Wasn't strawberries that were red  
He wasn't cutting bread  
  
You pass the jam  
And so he slammed the tea  
? here to me  
Was in the conservatory  
  
Yeah, alright  
Yes, but still over there  
Sinking ever deeper  
In the words of guilt and shame  
I can redeem myself  
I just don't care  
  
Staring at the silver spoon  
Take it from your mouth  
Take it from the chapter  
Turn and face the south  
  
Now face the north  
And the east  
And the west  
And the ?serpent song?  
  
Still burning on in the night  
Where's the sun at midnight  
Say it's gone  
  
Where's the moon at dawn  
It carries on and on  
It never ends  
  
To the land of nevermore  
Where time began  
Where the man still stands  
  
And the ? 'x' ? at the end  
Never know that I sang  
You'll all know it's the right place  
In time, well it is  
  
The words I'm singing  
That's just right  
They're better for my brain  
If I try to make much sense  
You know I'll go insane

I've been looking so long for you now you won't get away from my grasp.  
You've been living so long in hiding in hiding behind that false mask.  
And you know and I know that you ain't got long now to last.  
Your looks and your feelings are just the remains of your past.  
  
You're standing in the wings, there you wait for the curtain to fall.  
Knowing the terror and holding you have on us all.  
Yeah, I know that you're gonna scratch me, maim me and maul.  
You know I'm helpless from your mesmerizing cat call.  
  
Keep your distance, walk away, don't take his bait.  
Don't you stray, don't fade away.  
Watch your step, he's out to get you, come what may.  
Don't you stray, from the narrow way.  
  
I'm running and hiding in my dreams you're always there.  
You're the Phantom of the Opera, you're the devil, you're just out to scare.  
You damaged my mind and my soul it just floats through the air.  
Haunt me, you taunt me, you torture me back at your lair.

Into the abyss I'll fall-the eye of Horus  
Into the eyes of the night-watching me go  
Green is the cat's eye that glows-in this temple  
Enter the risen Osiris-risen again.  
  
[Chorus]  
Tell me why I had to be a power slave  
I don't want to die, I'm a god, why can't I live on?  
When the Life Giver dies, all around is laid to waste.  
And in my last hour,  
I'm a slave to the power of death.  
  
When I was living this lie-fear was my game  
People would worship and fall-drop to their knees  
So bring me the blood and red wine for the one to succeed me  
For he is a man and a god-and he will die too.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now I am cold but a ghost lives in my veins,  
Silent the terror that reigned-marbled in stone  
Shell of a man God preserved-a thousand ages  
But open the gates of my hell-I will strike from the grave.  
  
[Chorus]

Listen to me Lamia, listen to what I've got to say.  
I've got these feelings, and they won't go away.  
I've got these fears inside that'll bring me to my knees.  
Oh help me Lamia or I'm sure I'll die, oh please.  
  
I feel unsettled, now I know that I've done wrong.  
I've messed around with mystic things and magic for too long.  
I feel I'm being paid with this nightmare inside me,  
The devil's got a hold on my soul and he just won't let me be.  
  
I'm on my knees, oh help me please.  
I'm on my knees, help me please.  
  
Oh Lamia please try to help me.  
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.  
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.  
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh  
  
Oh Lamia please try to help me.  
The devil's got a hold of my soul and he won't let me be.  
Lamia I've got this curse, I'm turning to bad.  
The devil's got a hold of my soul, and it's driving me mad. Oh

Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty,  
I've just got to find my way.  
See the ladies flashing. All there legs and lashes.  
I've just got to find my way.  
  
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide.  
What you seeing girl?  
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,  
Can't you believe your eyes?  
It's the real thing girl.  
  
Got me feeling myself and reeling around,  
Got me talking but feel like walking around.  
Got me feeling myself and reeling a  
Got me talking but nothing's with me  
Got me feeling myself and reeling around.

Walking through the city, looking oh so pretty,  
I've just got to find my way.  
See the ladies flashing. All there legs and lashes.  
I've just got to find my way.  
  
Well you see me crawling through the bushes with it open wide.  
What you seeing girl?  
Can't you believe that feeling, can't you believe it,  
Can't you believe your eyes?  
It's the real thing girl.  
  
Got me feeling myself and reeling around,  
Got me talking but feel like walking around.  
Got me feeling myself and reeling a...  
Got me talking but nothing's with me...  
Got me feeling myself and reeling around.

When it all comes down the line  
And the lights they turn to greed  
And you race off with your tyres screaming  
Rolling thunder  
And the people choke with poison  
Children cry in fear  
But you've got your fast bullet  
One way ticket outta here  
  
[Chorus]  
Fall on your knees today  
And pray the world will mend its ways  
Get to your feet again  
Refugees from the heartbreak and the pain  
  
In the cities in the streets  
There's a tension you can feel  
Breaking strain is fast approaching  
Guns and riots  
Politicians gamble and lie to save their skins  
And the press get fed the scapegoats  
Public enema number one  
  
[Chorus]  
  
A million network slaves  
In an advertising new age  
I don't need a crystal ball to sell ya  
Your children have more brains  
Than your drug infested remains  
California dreaming as the earth dies screaming  
  
[Chorus]

Thinking of an age old dream, places I have never seen,  
Fantasies lived times before.  
I split my brain, melt through the floor.  
  
Over clouds my mind will fly, forever now I can't think why.  
My body tries to leave my soul.  
Or is it me, I just don't know.  
Memories rising from the past, the future's shadow overcast.  
Something's clutching at my head, through the darkness I'll be led.  
  
Oh another time, another place.  
Oh another smile on another face.  
When you see me floating up beside you,  
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.  
  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
  
Thinking of an age old dream, places I have never seen,  
Fantasies lived times before.  
I split my brain, melt through the floor.  
  
Over clouds my mind will fly, forever now I can't think why.  
My body tries to leave my soul.  
Or is it me, I just don't know.  
Memories rising from the past, the future's shadow overcast.  
Something's clutching at my head, through the darkness I'll be led.  
  
Oh another time, another place.  
Oh another smile on another face.  
When you see me walking up beside you,  
You get the feeling that all my love's inside of you.  
  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.  
Please take me away, take me away, so far away.

In a time when dinosaurs walked the earth  
When the land was swamp and caves were home  
In an age when prize possession was fire  
To search for landscapes men would roam.  
  
Then the tribes they came to steal their fire  
And the wolves they howled into the night  
As they fought a vicious angry battle  
To save the power of warmth and light.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched all through the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.  
  
And they thought that when the embers died away  
That the flame of life had burnt and died  
Didn't know the sparks that made the fire  
Were made by rubbing stick and stone.  
  
So they ploughed through the forest and swamps of danger  
And they fought the cannibal tribes and beasts  
In the search to find another fire  
To regain the power of light and heat.  
  
Drawn by quest for fire  
They searched across the land  
Drawn by quest for fire  
Discovery of man.

In the heat of the morning  
When your day is still dawning  
And your bird, she's singing  
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away  
  
Packed your bags in a hurry  
Because your mind's in a worry  
Mark my words, you're gonna be sorry if you ever fly away  
  
Sweet little girl with the Saint Da Vinci-smile  
Stares at me with sadness in her eyes  
I'm not sure if she's really real or make-believe  
Maybe she's a vision that comes to only me  
  
'Cause I'm so tired  
Yes I'm so tired  
So tired  
Yes I'm so tired  
  
In the heat of the morning  
When your day is still dawning  
And your bird, she's singing  
Catch your soul, he's willing to fly away

When I was wandering in the desert  
And was searching for the truth  
I heard a choir of angels calling out my name  
I had the feeling that my life would never be the same again  
I turned my face towards the barren sun  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in our lives like the cracks upon the ground  
They are sealed and are now washed away  
  
[Chorus:]  
You tell me we can start the rain  
You tell me that we all can change  
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears away  
You tell me we can start the rain  
You tell me that we all can change  
You tell me we can find something to wash the tears  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives  
They are sealed and now far away  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And I know of the pain that you feel the same as me  
And I dream of the rain as it falls upon the leaves  
And the cracks in the ground like the cracks are in our lives  
They are sealed and now far away

It's over your head  
And you don't seem to understand  
One word I say  
And you can't live your life  
Trying to run away  
  
You're fighting your friends  
You're wearing everybody out  
But it never ends  
You're wearing me out  
  
[Chorus]  
Come on  
Reach out  
And let somebody in your life  
  
Don't get me wrong  
You always apologize  
It's just your way  
Of making a scene  
You need to be loved  
It's not such a crime  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Over your head  
You just don't seem to understand  
One word I say  
And you can't live your life  
You got so much love  
It's burning inside  
  
[Chorus]

Unchain the colors before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.  
  
Tears for remembrance, and tears for joy,  
Tears for somebody and this lonely boy.  
Out in the madness, the all seeing eye,  
Flickers above us, to light up the sky.  
  
Unchain the colours before my eyes,  
Yesterday's sorrows, tomorrow's white lies.  
Scan the horizon, the clouds take me higher,  
I shall return from out of fire.

"O God of Earth and Altar,  
Bow down and hear our cry,  
Our earthly rulers falter,  
Our people drift and die,  
The walls of gold entomb us,  
The swords of scorn divide,  
Take not thy thunder from us,  
But take away our pride."  
(G. K. Chesterton English Hymnal)  
  
Just a babe in the black abyss,  
No reason for a place like this,  
The walls are cold and souls cry out in pain,  
An easy way for the blind to go,  
A clever path for the fools who know  
the Secret of the Hanged Man-the smile on his lips.  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
She came to me with a serpent's kiss,  
As the Eye of the Sun Rose on her lips,  
Moonlight catches silver tears I cry,  
So we lay in the black embrace,  
And the Seed is sown in a holy place  
And I watched, and I waited for the dawn.  
  
The light of the Blind-you'll see,  
The venom that tears my spine,  
The Eyes of the Nile are opening-you'll see.  
  
Bind all of us together,  
Ablaze with Hope and Free,  
No storm or heavy weather  
Will rock the boat you'll see.  
The time has come to close your eyes  
And still the wind and rain,  
For the one who will be King  
Is the Watcher in the Ring,  
It is You  
It is You

Hear the rime of the ancient mariner  
See his eye as he stops one of three  
Mesmerizes one of the wedding guests  
Stay here and listen to the nightmares of the sea.  
  
And the music plays on, as the bride passes by  
Caught by his spell and the mariner tells his tale.  
  
Driven south to the land of the snow and ice  
To a place where nobody's been  
Through the snow fog flies on the albatross  
Hailed in God's name, hoping good luck it brings.  
  
And the ship sails on, back to the North  
Through the fog and ice and the albatross follows on.  
  
The mariner kills the bird of good omen  
His shipmates cry against what he's done  
But when the fog clears, they justify him  
And make themselves a part of the crime.  
  
Sailing on and on and north across the sea  
Sailing on and on and north 'til all is calm.  
  
The albatross begins with it's vengeance  
A terrible curse a thirst has begun  
His shipmates blame bad luck on the mariner  
About his neck, the dead bird is hung.  
  
And the curse goes on and on at sea  
And the curse goes on and on for them and me.  
  
"Day after day, day after day,  
We stuck nor breath nor motion  
As idle as a painted ship upon a painted ocean  
Water, water everywhere and  
All the boards did shrink  
Water, water everywhere nor any drop to drink."  
  
There calls the mariner  
There comes a ship over the line  
But how can she sail with no wind in her sails and no tide?  
  
She... onward she comes  
Onward she nears out of the sun  
See, she has no crew  
She has no life, wait but here's two.  
  
Death and she life in death,  
They throw their dice for the crew  
She wins the mariner and he belongs to her now.  
Then, crew one by one  
They drop down dead, two hundred men  
She, she, Life in Death.  
She lets him live, her chosen one.  
  
"One after one by the star dogged moon,  
Too quick for groan or sigh  
Each turned his face with a ghastly pang  
And cursed me with his eye  
Four times fifty living men  
(And I heard nor sigh nor groan)  
With heavy thump, a lifeless lump,  
They dropped down one by one."  
  
The curse it lives on in their eyes  
The mariner he wished he'd die  
Along with the sea creatures  
But they lived on, so did he.  
  
And by the light of the moon  
He prays for their beauty not doom  
With heart he blesses them  
God's creatures all of them too.  
  
Then the spell starts to break  
The albatross falls from his neck  
Sinks down like lead into the sea  
Then down in falls comes the rain.  
  
Hear the groans of the long dead seamen  
See them stir and they start to rise  
Bodies lifted by good spirits  
None of them speak and they're lifeless in their eyes  
  
And revenge is still sought, penance starts again  
Cast into a trance and the nightmare carries on.  
  
Now the curse is finally lifted  
And the mariner sights his home  
Spirits go from the long dead bodies  
Form their own light and the mariner's left alone.  
  
And then a boat came sailing towards him  
It was a joy he could not believe  
The pilot's boat, his son and the hermit,  
Penance of life will fall onto him.  
  
And the ship it sinks like lead into the sea  
And the hermit shrives the mariner of his sins.  
  
The mariner's bound to tell of his story  
To tell this tale wherever he goes  
To teach God's word by his own example  
That we must love all things that God made.  
  
And the wedding guest's a sad and wiser man  
And the tale goes on and on and on.

Slowly bleeding, watch the vortex feeding  
Like a swirling vulture on your face  
Every hour the unseen rays devour  
Your screaming eyes cry out but they are blind  
  
Father, forgive me my sins  
Give me the nails, I'll hammer them in  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell, we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Get on the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
Brave new world of secret fantasy  
That hovers just beyond your bloody grasp  
Close enough to thrill, the danger of the kill  
Price for failure of your will  
  
Father, forgive us our sins  
'Cause we're all the junkies who never can win  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell, we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
Father, forgive me my sins  
Give me the nails, I'll hammer them in  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Parody of hope is the one that I must kill  
We all have to live with our family inventions  
Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets  
  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Say farewell, we may never meet again  
The road to hell is full of good intentions  
Down the left-hand highway with no sinister regrets

The convoy lights are dead ahead  
The merchantmen lay in their bed  
The thump of diesels hammers down  
In the oily sea-the killing ground  
His knuckles white his eyes alight  
He slams the hatch on the deadly night  
A cunning fox in the chickens lair  
A hound of hell and the devil don't care  
  
[Chorus]  
Running silent, running deep, we are your final prayer  
Warriors in secret sleep, a merchantman's nightmare  
A silent death lies awaiting, for all of you below  
Running silent, running deep, sink into your silent sleep  
  
Chill the hearts of fighting men  
In open ocean wondering when?  
The lethal silver fish will fly  
The boat will shiver-men will die  
A cast of millions-a part to play  
Killer victim or fool for a day  
Obeying an order-men have to die  
Us or them-a well rehearsed lie  
  
[Chorus]  
  
The lifeboats shattered the hull is torn  
The tar black smell of burning oil  
On the way down to Davy Jones  
Every man for himself-you're on your own  
The wolf eyes watch the cross wire  
'stern tubes ready', 'aim and fire

Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck  
I've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free  
  
Spent the night in an L. A. jail, and listened to the sirens wail  
They ain't got a thing on me, I'm running wild, I'm running free  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free  
  
Puller here at the Bottle Top, whiskey, dancing, disco hop  
Now all the boys are after me, and that's the way it's gonna be  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free

Just sixteen, a pickup truck, out of money, out of luck.  
I've got nowhere to call my own, hit the gas, and here I go.  
  
I'm running free yeah, I'm running free.  
I'm running free yeah, Oh I'm running free.  
  
Spent the night in an L. A. jail, and listened to the sirens wail.  
They ain't got a thing on me, I'm running wild, I'm running free.  
  
Puller here at the Bottle Top, whiskey, dancing, disco hop.  
Now all the boys are after me, and that's the way it's gonna be

Out of the winter came a war horse of steel  
I've never killed a woman before, but I know how it feels  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
I met up with a stranger last night to keep me alive  
He spends all his money on gambling and guns to survive  
I know you'd gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for Sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight  
  
I can laugh at the wind, I can howl at the rain.  
Down in the canyon or out in the plain.  
  
I know you'd have gone insane if you saw what I saw  
So now I've got to look for sanctuary from the law  
  
So give me sanctuary from the law and I'll be alright  
Just give me sanctuary from the law and love me tonight, tonight

Here they stand brothers them all  
All the sons divided they'd fall  
Here await the birth of the son  
The seventh, the heavenly, the chosen one  
  
Here the birth from an unbroken line  
Born the healer the seventh, his time  
Unknowingly blessed and as his life unfolds  
Slowly unveiling the power he holds  
  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
  
Then they watch the progress he makes  
The Good and the Evil which path will he take  
Both of them trying to manipulate  
The use of his powers before it's too late  
  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
Seventh son of a seventh son  
  
Today is born the seventh one  
Born of woman the seventh son  
And he in turn of a seventh son  
He has the power to heal  
He has the gift of the second sight  
He is the chosen one  
So it shall be written  
So it shall be done

(Iron Maiden)  
  
Life in a city living in L. A.  
Is a long way from Huddersfield town  
The back of the Rainbow's a long way from heaven  
But that's where he get's his pork pie  
Limos and ladies they're driving him queasy  
Rugby and cricket's unknown  
Baseball and football they're making him lazy  
Your fan club says "Rodney come home"  
  
[Chorus:]  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
Look down on Hollywood Hills  
The Sheriff of Huddersfield locked in his castle  
You're our own Hot Rod on wheels  
  
A good game of arrows a few dozen barrels  
The Nautilus rusts in the yard  
But for Yorkshire he's yearning but because he's earning  
He'll always live in L. A.  
A custom made wallet that stays in his pocket  
And never comes out to pay bills  
He's winning at poker and playing the Joker  
And he always cheats when he deals  
  
(repeat chorus)  
  
(Rodney's rap)  
Hello, let me introduce meself!  
My name is Rodney. I'm immensely strong.  
When I were a lad, I could lift up five  
Navies on an end of a shovel.  
The reason I never took martial arts because  
I was immensely fearsome and  
I'd probably kill everybody  
I came into contact with it.  
I was phenomenally strong.  
Pride and ego, my lads, pride and ego,  
Is what makes the world rotate.  
And everybody knows the centre of the universe is Huddersfield  
But I don't live there anymore.  
I live in Los Angeles.  
It's great!... I think  
  
Rufus the red has a crane by his bed  
To wrench himself up in the morn'  
But if you dare to tread at the foot of his bed  
You'll wish you'd never been born.  
A bear with a sore head we mean your forehead  
He slumbers for most of the day  
Wide eyed and legless baked beans for breakfast  
Your problem Rodney L. A.  
  
(repeat chorus)

Another time another place  
A hollow universe in space  
I took a trip to see the sights  
That will be blacker than the night  
  
One way ticket no returns  
My shooting stars are vastly burnt  
On the edge that you can see  
  
Let's shoot the moon you and me  
I'm not particular you'll see  
Just a lonesome galaxy  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
We slip into the night  
  
I'll say a mass for you and wave  
Shooting plasma from my grave  
  
Event horizon lost in space  
Running in a human race  
  
I don't know where I don't know why  
But somehow back in time again  
I'm on the edge that you can see  
  
I'm not particular at night  
A single party calling me  
You won't be tracking me by sight  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
We're slipping through the night  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
Shadows and the stars  
We will not return  
Humanity won't save us  
At the speed of light  
  
We're slipping through the night

Take a look in the pool and what do you see  
In the dark depths there faces beckoning me  
Can't you see them it's plain for all to see  
They were there oh I know you don't believe me  
  
Oh, I've never felt so strange  
But, I'm not going insane  
  
I've no doubt that you think I'm off my head  
You don't say but it's in your eyes instead  
Hours I spend out just gazing into that pool  
Something draws me there I don't know what to do  
  
Oh, they drain my strength away  
Oh, they're asking me to stay  
  
Nightmares, spirits calling me  
Nightmares, they won't leave me be  
  
All my life's blood is slowly draining away  
And I feel that I'm weaker every day  
Somehow I know I haven't long to go  
Joining them at the bottom of the pool  
  
Now, I feel they are so near  
I, begin to see them clear  
  
Nightmares, coming all the time  
Nightmares, Will give me peace of mind  
  
Now it's clear and I know what I have to do  
I must take you down there to look at them too  
Hand in hand then we'll jump right into the pool  
Can't you see not just me they want you too  
  
Oh, we'll drown together  
It, will be forever  
  
Nightmares, forever calling me  
Nightmares, Now we rest in peace

The only place where you can dream, living here is not what it seems.  
Ship of white light in the sky, nobody there to reason why.  
Here I am, I'm not really there, smiling faces ever so rare.  
A let's walk in deepest space, living here just isn't the place.  
  
Stalks of light come from the ground, when I cry there isn't a sound.  
All my feelings cannot be held, I'm happy in my new strange world.  
Shades of green grasses twine, girls drinking plasma wine.  
A look at love, a dream unfolds, living here, you'll never grow old.  
  
Don't you hear me call? Oh

Was many years ago that I left home and came this way,  
I was a young man full of hopes and dreams,  
But now it seems to me that all is lost and nothing gained,  
Sometimes things ain't what they seem,  
No brave new world, no brave new world,  
No brave new world, no brave new world.  
  
Night and day I scan horizon, sea and sky,  
My spirit wanders endlessly,  
Until the day will dawn and friends from home discover why,  
Hear me calling, rescue me,  
Set me free, set me free,  
Lost in this place and leave no trace.  
  
Stranger in a strange land,  
Land of ice and snow,  
Trapped here in this prison, yeah!  
Lost and far from home.  
  
One hundred years have gone and men again they came that way,  
To find the answer to the mystery,  
They found his body lying where it fell on that day,  
Preserved in time for all to see,  
No brave new world, no brave new world,  
Lost in this place, and leave no trace.  
  
What became of the man that started  
All are gone and their souls departed  
Left me here in this place  
So all alone  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
What became of the man that started  
All are gone and their souls departed  
Left me here in this place  
So all alone  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home  
  
Stranger in a strange land  
Land of ice and snow  
Trapped inside this prison  
Lost and far from home

You killed your first man at 13,  
Killer instinct, Animal supreme,  
By 16 you had learned to fight  
The way of the warrior, you took it as your right.  
  
Sunlight, falling on your steel,  
Death in life is your ideal,  
Life is like a wheel, rolling on and on.  
  
Through earth and water, fire and wind,  
you came at last-nothing was the end,  
Make a cut by fire and stones,  
Take you and your blade and break you both  
in two-break you both in two.  
  
Sunlight, falling on your steel,  
Death in life is your ideal,  
Life is like a wheel-and it's rolling still.

The words she said turned out why  
Desperation fills her eyes  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
When you taste defeat, when you loose again  
Fight and win, never give in  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
That girl you need  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
That girl, you know  
She'll never let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
That girl, That girl, That girl you need  
That girl, That girl, That girl, That girl  
  
Can you hear her call, call out your name  
Think about you, cry without you  
Hold her in your arm  
Don't let go  
  
Can you taste defeat, when you loose again  
Fight and win, never give in  
Hold her in your arms  
Don't let go  
  
That girl you need  
Gonna knock you off your feet  
That girl, you know  
She'll never let you go  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
You need!

Silently to silence fall  
In the fields of futile war  
Toys of death are spitting lead  
Where boys that were our soldiers bled  
war horse and war machine  
  
Curse the name of liberty  
Marching on as if they should  
Mix in the dirt our brothers' blood  
  
In the mud and rain  
What are we fighting for  
Is it worth the pain is it worth dying for  
Who will take the blame  
Why did they make a war  
Questions that come again  
Should we be fighting at all  
  
Once a ploughman hitched his team  
Here he sowed his little dream  
Now bodies arms and legs are strewn  
Where mustard gas and barbwire bloom  
Each moment's like a year  
I've nothing left inside for tears  
Comrades dead or dying lie  
I'm left alone asking why  
  
After the war  
Left feeling no one has won  
After the war  
What does a soldier become

Now I'm here can you see me  
'cause I'm out on my own  
When the room goes cold tell me  
You can feel me  
Cause I'm here  
  
Here I am, can you see me  
Passing through, on my way  
To a place I'd been to only in my  
Dreams before  
  
In a world of delusion  
Never turn your back on a friend  
'cause you can count your  
Real true friends on one hand  
  
Through life  
  
There are those that deceive you  
There are those that'll let you down  
Is there someone out there that would  
Die for you  
Thought not  
  
Live your life with a passion  
Everything you do, do well  
You only get out of life what you put in  
So they say  
  
In a world of confusion  
People never say what they mean  
If you want a straight answer  
Go look for one  
Right now  
  
In a room full of strangers  
Do you stand with your back to the wall  
Do you sometimes feel like you're  
On the outside  
Looking in?  
  
You can make your own luck  
You create your destiny  
I believe you have the power  
If you want to  
It's true  
  
You can do what you want to  
If you try a little bit harder  
A little bit of faith goes a long way  
It does  
  
Are we here for a reason?  
I'd like to know just what you think  
It would be nice to know what  
Happens when we die  
Wouldn't it?  
There are some who are wise  
There are some who are born naive  
I believe that there are some that must  
Have lived before  
Don't you?  
  
As for me, well I'm thinking  
You gotta keep an open mind  
But I hope that my life's not an  
Open and shut case  
  
Extrasensory Perception  
Life after death, telepathy  
Can the soul live on and travel through  
Space and time?  
  
You know I feel so elated  
'cause I'm about to find it out  
And when I know all the answers  
Maybe then I'll come back  
To fill you in  
  
You don't be alarmed now  
If I try to contact you  
If things go missing or get moved around  
It's me  
And don't disbelieve it  
No matter what your "friends"  
Might say  
We'll meet up again someplace  
Some way  
One day

Now the contracts out  
They've put the word about  
I'm coming after you  
  
It's not the money I make  
It's the thrill of the chase  
And I'm coming after you  
  
I watch your every move  
Study the things you do  
And the pattern of your ways  
  
I watch the way you walk  
I hear your telephone talk  
I want to understand the way you think  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
Better watch out, cause I'm the assassin,  
Better watch out, better watch out  
  
I'm in a cold cold sweat  
I taste the smell of death  
I know the moment's getting closer  
  
And as you walk to the light  
I feel my hands go tight  
Excitement running through my veins  
  
I've got you in my sights  
I've got you dead to rights  
The triggers waiting for my finger  
  
I feel adrenalin rush  
It's just the final touch  
You can kiss your ass goodbye  
  
[Chorus]

Feel the sweat break on my brow  
Is it me or is it shadows that are  
Dancing on the walls  
Is this a dream or is it now  
Is this a vision or normality I see  
Before my eyes  
  
I wonder why I wonder how  
That it seems that the powers getting stronger  
Every day  
I feel a strength an inner fire  
But I'm scared I won't be able to control it anymore  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
  
Just by looking through your eyes  
He could see the future penetrating right  
In through your mind  
See the truth and see your lies  
But for all his power couldn't foresee his own demise  
  
There's a time to live and a time to die  
When it's time to meet the maker  
There's a time to live but isn't it strange  
That as soon as you're born you're dying  
And reborn again?

Wake alone in the hills  
With the wind in your face  
It feels good to be proud  
And be free and a race  
That is part of a clan  
And to live on highlands  
And the air that you breathe  
So pure and so clean  
  
When alone on the hills  
With the wind in your hair  
With a longing to feel  
Just to be free  
  
Is it right to believe  
In the need to be free  
It's a time when you die  
And without asking why  
Can't you see what they do  
They are grinding us down  
They are taking our land  
That belongs to the clans  
  
Not alone with a dream  
Just want to be free  
With a need to belong  
I am a clansman  
Freedom  
  
It's a time wrought with fear  
It's a land wrought with change  
  
Ancestors could hear  
What is happening now  
They would turn in their graves  
They would all be ashamed  
That the land of the free  
Has been written in chains  
And I know what I want  
  
When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what is mine  
I am the clansman  
  
And I swear to defend  
And we'll fight to the end  
And I swear that I'll never  
Be taken alive  
And I know that we'll stand  
And we'll fight for our land  
And I swear that my bairns Will be born free  
  
And I know what I want  
When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what I want  
I am the clansman  
Freedom  
  
And I know what I want When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what is mine I am the clansman  
  
No, no we can't let them take anymore  
No we can't let them take anymore  
We've the land of the free  
Freedom  
  
Is it right to believe  
In the need to be free  
It's a time when you die  
And without asking why  
Can't you see what they do  
They are grinding us down  
They are taking our land  
That belongs to the clans  
  
Not alone with a dream  
Just want to be free  
With a need to belong  
I am a clansman  
  
And I know what I want  
When the timing is right  
Then I'll take what is mine  
I am the clansman  
Freedom

He threw down a glove you made the mistake  
Of picking it up now you're gone  
The choosing of guns or fighting with swords  
The choice of weapons is done  
He'll tear you apart as soon as you start  
You know you don't have a chance.  
CHORUS  
OH...OH...Fight for the honour  
Fight for the splendour  
Fight for the pleasure  
OH...OH...Fight for the honour  
Fight for the splendour  
Fight for your life!  
Ready to start the duel begins the best man wins in the end.  
A lunge and a feint, a parry too late  
A cut to the chest and you're down  
Seeing the stain then feeling the pain  
Feeling the sweat on your brow.  
CHORUS  
The fighting resumes, a silence looms the swordsmen move 'gainst each  
other  
A cut and a thrust, a parry, a blow, a stab to the heart and you're down  
The Angel of Death hears your last breath  
Meanwhile the Reaper looks on.  
CHORUS  
OH...OH...Fought the honour  
Fought for the splendour  
Fought for the pleasure  
OH...OH...Fought for the honour  
fought for the splendour  
Fought to the death

I've looked into the heart of darkness  
Where the blood red journey ends  
When you've faced the heart of darkness  
Even your soul begins to bend  
  
For a week I have been waiting  
Still I am only in Saigon  
The walls move in a little closer  
I feel the jungle call me on  
  
Every minute I get weaker  
While in the jungle they grow strong  
What I wanted was a mission  
And for my sins they gave me one  
  
They brought it up just like room service  
Cause everyone gets what they want  
And when that mission was all over  
I'd never want another one  
  
I know, captain that you've done this work before  
We've got a problem you can help us all I'm sure  
The colonel's gone rogue  
and his methods are unsound  
You'll take a PBR up river track him down  
  
There's a conflict in every human heart  
And the temptation is to take it all too far  
In this war things get so confused  
But there are some things which can not be excused  
  
He's acting like a god an insane lunatic  
Your mission, exterminate with extreme prejudice  
The route is dangerous and your progress may be slow  
Here is the file and it's all you need to know  
  
Here I am the knife in my hand  
And now I understand why the genius must die  
  
Now I stand alone in darkness  
With his blood upon my hands  
Where sat the warrior the poet  
Now lie the fragments of a man

Love is a razor and I walked the line on that silver blade  
Slept in the dust with his daughter,  
Her eyes red with the slaughter of innocence  
And I will pray for her, I will call her name out loud  
And I will bleed for her, if I could only see her now  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Balancing on a ledge, living on a razor's edge  
Balancing on a ledge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
  
Circle of fire my baptism of joy at an end it seems  
The seventh lamb slain, the book of life opens before me  
And I will pray for you, someday I may return  
Don't you cry for me, beyond is where I learn  
  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
  
Living on a razor's edge, balancing on a ledge  
Living on a razor's edge, you know, you know  
  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil that men do lives on and on  
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do  
The evil, the evil, the evil that men do

In the gloom the gathering storm abates  
In the ships gimlet eyes await  
The call to arms to hammer at the gates  
To blow them wide throw evil to its fate  
  
All summers long the drills to build the machine  
To turn men from flesh and blood to steel  
From paper soldiers to bodies on the beach  
From summer sands to Armageddon's reach  
  
Overlord, your master not your god  
The enemy coast dawning Grey with scud  
These wretched souls puking, shaking fear  
To take a bullet for those who sent them here  
  
The world's alight, the cliffs erupt in flame  
No escape, remorseless shrapnel rains  
Drowning men no chance for a warrior's fate  
A choking death enter hell's gate  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive  
  
[Chorus x2:]  
How long on this longest day  
'Til we finally make it through  
How long on this longest day  
'Til we finally make it through  
  
The rising dead, faces bloated torn  
They are relieved, the living wait their turn  
Your number's up, the bullet's got your name  
You still go on, to hell and back again  
  
Valhalla waits, valkyries rise and fall  
The warrior tombs, lie open for us all  
A ghostly hand reaches through the veil  
Blood and sand, we will prevail  
  
Sliding we go, only fear on our side  
To the edge of the wire,  
And we rush with the tide  
Oh the water is red,  
With the blood of the dead  
But I'm still alive, pray to God I survive  
  
[Chorus x 4]

Pay to kill, die to lose, hunted, hunter which are you  
Diablo come again to make trophies out of men  
Lose your skin, lose your skull, one by one the sack is full  
In the heat dehydrate, know which breath will be your last  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
  
Human heart, human mind, intellect intertwined  
Focus sharp in the night, watch the jungle burning bright  
Toe to toe throw the line, everyone's caught hand tied  
Iron will iron fist, how could it have come to this?  
  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay live  
Nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, you've got to kill to stay alive  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain  
Show them no fear, show them no pain

You'll take my life but I'll take yours too  
You'll fire your musket but I'll run you through  
So when you're waiting for the next attack  
You'd better stand there's no turning back  
  
The bugle sounds as the charge begins  
But on this battlefield no one wins  
The smell of acrid smoke and horses breath  
As you plunge into a certain death  
  
The horse he sweats with fear we break to run  
The mighty roar of the Russian guns  
And as we race towards human wall  
The screams of pain as my comrades fall  
  
We hurdle bodies that lay on the ground  
And as the Russians fire another round  
We get so near yet so far away  
We won't live to fight another day  
  
We get so close near enough to fight  
When a Russian gets me in his sights  
He pulls the trigger and I feel the blow  
A burst of rounds takes my horse below  
  
And as I lay there gazing at the sky  
My body's numb and my throat is dry  
And as I lay forgotten and alone  
Without a tear I draw my parting groan

He is the king of all the land  
In the Kingdom of the sands  
Of a time tomorrow.  
  
He rules the sand worms and the Fremen  
In a land amongst the stars  
Of an age tomorrow.  
  
He is destined to be a King  
He rules over everything  
On the land called planet Dune.  
  
Body water is your life  
And without it you would die  
On the desert the planet Dune.  
  
Without a still suit you would fry  
On the sands so hot and dry  
In a world called Arrakis.  
  
It is a land that's rich in spice  
The sand riders and the "mice"  
That they call the "Muad'Dib".  
  
He is the Kwizatz Haderach.  
He is born of Caladan  
And will take the Gom Jabbar.  
  
He has the power to foresee  
Or to look into the past  
He is the ruler of the stars  
  
The time will come for him  
To lay claim his crown,  
And then the foe yes  
They'll be cut down,  
You'll see he'll be the  
Best that there's been,  
Messiah supreme  
True leader of men,  
And when the time  
For judgement's at hand  
Don't fret he's strong  
And he'll make a stand,  
Against evil and fire  
That spreads through the land,  
He has the power  
To make it all end.

Cold as steel the darkness waits, it's hour will come  
A cry of fear for the chosen worshipping the sun  
Mother natures black revenge on those who waste her life  
War babies in the garden of Eden shall turn our ashes to ice  
  
[Chorus]  
Sunrise is gone, freezing up the fires  
Sunrise is gone, numbing all desires  
Sunrise is gone, Sunrise is gone  
  
Around the world the people stop with terror-stricken eyes  
A shadow cast upon them all to crush them like a fly  
In the icy rain and whiplashed seas there's nowhere left to run  
The hammer blows of winter fall like a hurricane  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Around the world the nations wait  
For some wise words from their leading light  
You know it's not only madmen who listen to fools  
"Is this the end" the millions cried  
Clutching their riches as they died  
Those who survive must weather the storm  
  
Gone are the days when man looked down  
They've taken away his sacred crown  
To be so free, it took so long  
It's not the journeys end, it's just begun

She lays in bed at night and that is when I make my call.  
But when she stares at me, she can't see nothing at all,  
Because, you see, I can't take no shape or form.  
It's been three long years since I've been gone.  
  
I can't get used to purgatory, you know it really makes me cry.  
I'll never know the reason why I had to go.  
Oh, oh, I'm crying,  
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.  
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?  
Ah can't you see me?  
  
I'm looking forward to her spirit coming over to me.  
I feel tempted to bring her over to see just what it's  
Like to be hanging on the other side.  
I feel so lonely, it's a long time since I died.  
  
I try to show her that she's never gonna be alone,  
Because my spirit is imprisoned in the twilight zone.  
Oh, oh, I'm crying,  
Oh, oh, oh, deep inside of me.  
Oh, oh, oh, can't you see me?  
Ah can't you see me?

There's an evil virus that's threatening mankind  
Not state of the art, a serious state of the mind  
The muggers, the backstabbers, the two faced elite  
A menace to society, a social disease  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay  
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray  
Eating away at your own self esteem  
Pouncing on every word that you might be saying  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order  
  
Superficially smiling a shake of the hand  
As soon as the back is turned treachery is planned  
  
Rape of the mind is a social disorder  
The cynics, the apathy one-upmanship order  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay  
Gloating or sneering at life's disarray  
  
When every good thing's laid to waste  
By all the jealousy and hate  
By all the acid wit and rapier lies  
  
And every time you think you're safe  
And when you go to turn away  
You know they're sharpening all their paper knives  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to relate it  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to escape it  
  
Without a conscience they destroy  
And that's a thing that they enjoy  
They're a sickness that's in all our minds  
  
They want to sink the ship and leave  
The way they laugh at you and me  
You know it happens all the time  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to relate it  
  
All in your mind  
All in your head  
Try to escape it  
  
The rats in the cellar you know who you are  
Or do you?  
  
Watching beginnings of social decay

From the coast of gold, across the seven seas,  
I'm traveling on, far and wide,  
But now it seems, I'm just a stranger to myself,  
And all the things I sometimes do, it isn't me but someone else.  
  
I close my eyes, and think of home,  
Another city goes by, in the night,  
Ain't it funny how it is, you never miss it til it's gone away,  
And my heart is lying there and will be til my dying day.  
  
So understand  
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,  
Face up, make your stand,  
And realize you're living in the golden years.  
  
Too much time on my hands, I got you on my mind,  
Can't ease this pain, so easily,  
When you can't find the words to say, it's hard to make it through another
day,  
And it makes me want to cry, and throw my hands up to the sky.  
  
So understand  
Don't waste your time always searching for those wasted years,  
Face up, make your stand,  
And realize you're living in the golden years.

The rebel of yesterday, tomorrow's fool  
Who are you kidding being that cool?  
  
Trying to break away from running  
With the pack  
But they ain't listening so you've  
Gotta go back  
  
You're a weekend warrior when  
You're one of the crowd  
But it's over, just look at you now  
  
You're not so brave the way you behave  
It makes you sick, gotta get out quick  
It's all bravado when you're out  
With your mates  
It's like a different person goes through  
Those gates  
And the game begins  
The adrenalin's high  
Feel the tension maybe someone  
Will die  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't  
That way anymore  
  
You've gotta get out gotta get away  
But you're in with a clique it's not  
Easy to stray  
You've gotta admit you're just  
Living a lie  
It didn't take long to work out why  
  
It's hard to say why you got involved  
Just wanting to be part  
Just wanting to belong  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you ain't  
That way anymore  
  
Some of the things that you've done  
You feel so ashamed  
After all it's only a game... isn't it?  
And after all the adrenalin's gone  
What you gonna do on Monday?  
  
A weekend warrior lately  
A weekend warrior sometimes  
A weekend warrior maybe you were  
Never like that at all

My telescope looks out  
Into the stars tonight  
A little speck of light  
Seems twice the size tonight  
The Calculations are so fine  
Can it be growing all the Time?  
  
Now I can't believe its true  
And I don't know what to do  
For the hundredth time  
I check the declination  
  
Now the fear starts to grow  
Even my computer shows  
There are no errors in the calculations  
  
Now it's happened take no other view  
Collision course, you must believe it's true  
Now there's nothing left that we can do  
  
When Two Worlds collide  
The anger and the pain  
Of all those who remain  
Two worlds collide  
Who will be left alive  
No place to hide  
  
When Two Worlds Collide  
The anger, the pain  
Of those who remain  
When two worlds collide  
When two worlds collide  
So who will survive  
There's No place to hide  
When Two Worlds collide

It's snowing outside the rumbling sound  
Of engines roar in the night.  
The mission is near the confident men  
Are waiting to drop from the sky.  
  
The Blizzard goes on but still they must fly  
No one should go where eagles dare.  
  
Bavarian alps that lay all around  
They seem to stare from below.  
The enemy lines a long time passed  
Are lying deep in the snow.  
  
Into the night they fall through the sky  
No one should fly where eagles dare.  
  
They're closing in the fortress is near  
It's standing high in the sky.  
The cable car's the only way in  
It's really impossible to climb.  
  
They make their way but maybe too late  
They've got to try to save the day.  
  
The panicking cries the roaring of guns  
Are echoing all around the valley.  
The mission complete they make to escape  
Away from the Eagles Nest.  
  
They dared to go where no one would try  
They chose to fly where eagles dare.

I'm gonna organise some changes in my life,  
I'm gonna exorcise the demons of my past,  
I'm gonna take the car and hit the open road,  
I'm feeling ready to just open up and go  
  
And I just feel like I can be anything,  
that I might ever wish to be,  
and fantasize just what I want to to be,  
make my wildest dreams come true  
  
I'm on my way.  
Out on my own again I'm on my way out on the road again,  
  
When I remember back to how that things used to be,  
and I was stuck inside a shroud of misery I felt I disappeared so deep inside
my self  
I couldn't find a way to break away the hell  
  
When I'm feeling down and low,  
I vow I'll never be the same again,  
I just remember what I am, and visualize what I'm gonna be,  
  
I'm on my way. Out on my own again,  
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,  
  
I'm gonna break away, I'm out on my own,  
I'm out on my own, gonna break away, breaking away,  
  
I'm on my way, out my own again,  
I'm on my way, out on the road again, I'm on my way, out on my own again,  
I'm on my way, I'm gonna break away,
