In the heat of the day many miles away  
When the sun is beating down upon the main street  
I'll be waiting here at the station,  
I gotta move down the line.  
  
They'll be dancin' and singin' and doin' their thing  
And they'll be rockin' and rollin' until the day is done.  
You know I got to make the deadline.  
  
I gotta get that southbound train tonight,  
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.  
  
The Mardi Gras will be blowing strong  
And the people dancing all across the city.  
I'm leaving here tonight,  
Gotta move down the line.  
  
I'm gonna catch a ride on the 9:05,  
I'm gonna ride the rails until we reach the morning,  
maybe three or four hundred miles.  
  
I gotta get that southbound train tonight,  
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.  
  
When the wind is blowing  
Softly through the streets  
Of a little town and the music's playin  
You're waiting somewhere over the horizon.  
  
I gotta get that southbound train tonight, ooh.  
If I don't get to the border then I'll write.

The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, you had to slip away  
After all that spark  
You, said all that you could say  
And slipped into the dark  
I could not let you go  
Alone into the night  
I had to let you know  
The magic there, in the night air  
  
The night has a thousand eyes  
And they're all on you  
The night has a thousand ears  
Listening to your cries  
Let it work its magic  
Let it work its magic  
The night has a thousand eyes  
  
You, somewhere out in the dark  
Runs a wounded heart  
You, stumbling in the night  
In the air of after light  
You take along the fears  
Did you waste these years  
And did they warn you  
Of the night zone all alone  
  
Sometimes it takes a fight  
To keep everything on track  
And sometimes it takes a starry night  
To bring the magic back  
This was the time  
And this was the place  
With starlight on your face  
And the moon on the rise  
The night has a thousand eyes

What can you tell me, of the perfect man.  
What can you tell me, now I don't quite understand.  
We lose our grip, we glide and stall.  
Some things come easy, some don't come at all.  
We chip away at the perfect man.  
What can you show me, now I don't quite understand.  
Eye to eye nothing left to say  
But will you really throw it all away.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Things go wrong, though are strong.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Round and round, we all fall down.  
Sometime....  
No matter how we try to keep things straight.  
It makes no difference, while we cause our fate.  
We burn our candle unaware.  
While on our knees we cry in prayer.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Pain won't last, this too shall pass.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Round and round, time and time, again.  
But ahhhh,  
If it's so simple then explain to me.  
How pain is so close to ecstasy.  
How change can make you feel so free.  
Ahhhh,  
If we were meant to be such perfect fools.  
Then why do we always break the rules,  
Crashing through life's scenery.  
We trip, we stumble, and we all fall down.  
Angry cries and desperate lies.  
We slip, we fumble, and we all fall down  
Hearts to mend, sun comes up again.  

Everybody all around the world, gotta tell you what I just heard  
There's gonna be a party all over the world  
  
I got a message on the radio, but where it came from I don't really know  
And I heard these voices calling all over the world  
  
[Chorus:]  
All over the world, everybody got the word  
Everybody everywhere is gonna feel tonight  
  
Everybody walkin' down the street, everybody movin' to the beat  
They're gonna get hot down in the U.S.A.  
New York, Detroit, L.A.  
  
We're gonna take a trip across the sea, everybody come along with me  
We're gonna hit the night down in gay Paris  
  
[Chorus]  
  
London, Hamburg, Paris, Rome, Rio, Hong Kong, Tokyo  
L.A., New York, Amsterdam, Monte Carlo, Shard End and  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everybody all around the world, gotta tell you what I just heard  
Everybody walkin' down the street, I know a place where we all can meet  
Everybody gonna have a good time, everybody will shine till the daylight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All over the world, everybody got the word  
All over the world, everybody got the word  
All over the world, everybody got the word

She was a good girl  
Been true to herself  
Never swayed by the notions of somebody else  
She'd had it rough, maybe most of the time  
With only one thing on her mind  
  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
Who was tryin' to do the best that he can  
All she wanted was a lovin', lovin' man  
  
There could be blue skies in her heart  
She was waitin' for the good times to start  
She never wanted diamonds  
She never wanted gold  
She was holdin' out for someone to hold  
  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
Who was tryin' to do the best that he can  
All she wanted was a lovin', lovin' man  
  
A loving man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
Who was tryin' to do the best that he can  
All she wanted was a lovin', lovin' man  
  
Loving man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man  
All she wanted was a lovin' man

The gold verandah in the dark has gone  
down to the metal man.  
No better time to leave the ground  
And maybe try to understand.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright.  
  
And through the darkest times of your life  
You always tried to be the one,  
And now the times have made you wonder  
If you ever knew what was goin' on.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.  
  
(background) Alright ... alright ... alright  
  
No use thinkin' about what you ain't got,  
Just makes you bitter.  
And as you speak, everything that you say  
Goes out on the big transmitter.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.  
  
You gotta hold on to somethin' that you believe,  
Hold on to somethin' that makes you feel alright....  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.  
  
Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.

Blackberry way absolutely pouring down with rain,  
It's a terrible day.  
Up with the lark, silly girl i don't know what to say,  
She was running away.  
But now I'm standing on the corner,  
Lost in the things that i said.  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Flowers in the park overgrowing but the trees are bare  
There's a memory there.  
Boats on the lake, unattended now for all to drown  
I'm incredibly down.  
Just like myself they are neglected,  
Turn with my eyes to the wall  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Run for the train, look behind you for she may be there  
Said a thing in the air  
Blackberry way, see the battlefield of careless sins  
Cast to the winds  
So full of emptiness without her,  
Lost in the words that i said.  
What am i supposed to do now?  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.  
  
Goodbye blackberry way  
I can't see you, i don't need you.  
Goodbye blackberry way  
Sure to want me back another day.

Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
  
Madman drummers bummers, Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat  
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat  
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-
round  
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin, the calliope crashed to the
ground  
The calliope crashed to the ground  
  
But she was...  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
  
Some silicone sister with a manager mister told me I go what it takes  
She said "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong, play the song with the
funky break"  
And go-cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe
outside  
And little Early-Pearly came by in his curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a
ride  
Asked me if I needed a ride  
  
But she was...  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
  
She got down but she never got tired  
She's gonna make it through the night  
She's gonna make it through the night  
  
[ guitar solo ]  
  
But mama, that's where the fun is  
But mama, that's where the fun is  
Mama always told me not to look into the eye's of the sun  
But mama, that's where the fun is  
  
Some brimstone baritone anticyclone rolling stone preacher from the east  
Says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in it's funny bone, that's where they
expect it least"  
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner, watching the young
girls dance  
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone, reminding him
of romance  
The calliope crashed to the ground  
  
But she was...  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
  
Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Madman drummers bummers, Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat  
(Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night)  
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat  
(Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night)  
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-
round  
(Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night)  
With this very unpleasin', sneezin' and wheezin, the calliope crashed to the
ground  
(Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night)  
Now Scott with a slingshot finially found a tender spot and throws his lover
in the sand  
(Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night)  
Now Scott with a slingshot finially found a tender spot and throws his lover
in the sand  
(Blinded by the light, revved up like a deuce, another runner in the night)  
And some bloodshot forget-me-not said daddy's within earshot save the
buckshot, turn up the band  
Some silicone sister with a manager mister told me I go what it takes  
(Blinded by the light)  
She said "I'll turn you on sonny to something strong"  
  
She got down but she never got tired  
She's gonna make it through the night

The streets, the signs are pointing all one way  
But you don't realize just what they say  
You may fight, you may run, you may know what you've done  
It makes me feel so sad to think what I might've had  
I watch the stars, I watch the sun, now I watch for anyone  
But it's only make believe  
  
You work, you work, you work so hard and then  
Someone, someone will come around again  
You may think it's for real, but you know how you feel  
The places that I go don't feel good anymore  
I see it all rainbows in fall I see her face upon my wall  
But it's only make believe  
  
Fly away, bluebird fly away for me  
To a place somewhere far across the sea  
Fly away, far away, don't look back, go today  
The waves that crash upon the sand  
Another place, a far off land  
And every day, I have to stay, but you are free  
You could fly away  
But it's only make believe  

Little darlin' of my life  
You keep movin' cross my mind  
You gave me a sunny day  
Now it looks as if I'll pay  
  
[Chorus:]  
Why do they say, bluebird is dead  
I can still see her, touch her, my bluebird  
The love that she gave, I don't believe, no, no, I don't believe  
  
Bluebird came to me tonight  
Waiting patiently for light  
She said I know that you will grieve  
But my darlin' I must leave  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Bluebird say it is not so  
Please I cannot hear you speak  
It must be that you're so tired  
In the darkness of the night  
  
[Chorus]

Hey Boy Blue, can't you hear all  
the noise.  
It's for you, all the town's waiting  
there.  
Let us go, there's a show like you ain't  
seen before  
Welcome home, where you been all  
these years,  
Look around, all the crowd is in tears,  
It's so good to see you in the streets  
of your town.  
  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
  
I've seen bold knights, dropping  
down like flies,  
I've seen kings, rolling in the mire,  
I've seen God, point the finger of  
doom to our foes.  
I have fought in the holiest wars,  
I have smashed, some of the holiest jaws  
I've been jailed, been impaled, and  
been dragged through the world.  
One thing, I have learned through  
these years,  
Is that no man, should be stricken  
with fear  
It should be that he walks with no  
care in the world.  
So my friends, who are gathered here  
today,  
Hear this clear, for I'll not further say,  
That no man, shall cause me to take  
up arms again.  
  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  
Hey Boy Blue is back.  

Pretty pretty are the girls as they go by  
Chilly chilly is the air under moonlit sky  
The windows watch you as you walk along  
And the streets lead back to where you started from  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Silly silly are the thoughts that fill your head  
Wish I'd never set out, wish I'd stayed in bed  
You see reflections from across the street  
So you better start movin' stop draggin' your feet  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Money money, gotta get some money and run  
It's an issue I find unenviable  
It doesn't matter which way you turn  
But you gotta keep trying cause you never learn  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Funny funny how the world goes round and round  
You better watch your step don't make a sound  
The windows watch you as you walk along  
And the streets lead back to where you started from  
  
The cities watching and you can't get by  
No matter where you hide you know the buildings have eyes  
This place is lonely but you can't get away  
No matter what you say you know the buildings have eyes  
  
Pretty pretty  
Chilly chilly  
Silly silly  
Money money

Somebody told her that there was a place like heaven  
Across the water on a 747  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
And pretty soon she's really got the notion  
Of flying out across the big blue ocean  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
Talk is cheap on satellite  
But all I get is static information  
I'm still here re-dial on automatic  
  
Calling America (can't get a message through)  
Calling America (that's what she said to do)  
Calling America (that's where she has to be)  
Calling America (she left a number for me)  
Calling America  
  
But I'm just talking to a satellite  
Twenty thousand miles up in the sky each night  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
All I had to do was pick up the phone  
I'm out in space, trying to talk to someone  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
She left a number I could call  
But no one's there, no one at all  
There must be something going wrong  
That number just rings on and on  
  
Calling America (can't get a message through)  
Calling America (that's what she said to do)  
Calling America (that's where she has to be)  
Calling America (she left a number for me)  
Calling America  
  
Said she'd call when she'd been gone a while  
Guess she's missing me across the miles  
Yeah, we're living in  
In a modern world  
  
Calling America (can't get a message through)  
Calling America (that's what she said to do)  
Calling America (that's where she has to be)  
Calling America (she left a number for me)  
Calling America  

Sometimes you get caught in a trap and you don't know it  
Sometimes it's better to get out while you know it  
Some people never learn they keep on falling  
You can never get out if you keep on stalling  
  
Then you get,  
  
(chorus:) caught in a trap caught in dead end  
Caught in a trap with nowhere to run  
Then you get, caught in a trap caught in dead end  
Nowhere to turn but it can't go on  
  
Caught in a trap  
  
Sometimes you got to know where to run for cover  
Sometimes your better out till the heat is over  
  
Ah you get (chorus)  
  
Caught in a trap  
  
Don't know how it happened but then it's too late  
Then you gotta move on the times, you can't wait  
  
Cus you got (chorus)

Caught in a trap

Come with me  
  
Its all so easy for me to see  
We can be  
Close together, for always forever  
Youll never believe but it's true  
  
You will see  
The happy corners where we will be  
Its for real  
Ill sing to you all the songs that we knew  
That's not true don't be blue they're for you  
  
Can you feel  
Its spinning round like a great big wheel  
Its for real  
Ill sing to you all the songs that we knew  
That's not true don't be blue they're for you  
  
Come with me  
Come with me  
  
Come with me  
Its all so easy for me to see  
Come with me  
When I find that you're all on my mind  
That's the time I will say come with me

Everywhere the sun is shining.  
All around the world it's shining.  
But cold winds blow across your mind.  
Confusion--it's such a terrible shame.  
Confusion--you don't know what you're sayin'.  
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on.  
You feel there's no-one there for you to lean on.  
  
Every night you're out there darlin'.  
You're always out there runnin'.  
And I see that lost look in your eyes.  
Confusion,I don't know what I should do.  
Confusion,I leave it all up to you.  
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on.  
You feel there's no-one there for you to lean on.  
  
Dark is the road you wander.  
And as you stand there under.  
The starry sky,you feel sad inside.  
Confusion,you know it's drivin' me wild.  
Confusion,it comes as no big surprise.  
You've lost your love and you just can't carry on.  
You feel there's no-one there for you to lean on.  

Here she comes down the street and that look is in her eye  
And the way she looks, if looks could kill they might  
All the kids down in the street run away  
When she goes by it's the end of the day  
So believe what they say, there's danger in the air  
  
Look through a window and you'll see her standing there  
She's the latest of the greatest with the wind blowin' in her hair  
The prima donna she's back in town  
And you see her for miles around  
So believe what they say there's danger in the air  
  
Beware there's danger ahead  
The endless summer is dead  
Look out there's danger ahead  
  
Monday mornin' she's already up and gone  
She knows what she wants and she knew it all along  
With her entourage on either side  
Just one look she can't be denied  
So believe what they say there's danger in the air  
  
Beware there's danger ahead  
The endless summer is dead  
Look out there's danger ahead  
  
She's got a reputation that's way ahead of her time  
She's got adulation that's way ahead of her mind  
Everybody runs around to please  
When she looks in the mirror she just has to freeze  
So believe what they say there's danger in the air  
  
Beware there's danger ahead  
The endless summer is dead  
Look out there's danger ahead  

Got a good reason  
For taking the easy way out  
Got a good reason  
For taking the easy way out now

I'll tell you once more before I get off the floor  
Don't bring me down.

The world outside don't like us much,  
'Cause they ain't got our classy touch,  
But they ain't good enough to breathe,  
This towns good air we make 'em leave.  
  
[Chorus:]  
But it's no, no, no, you really can't do that,  
No, no, no, down home town.  
  
No monkey business in this town,  
Well who do you think you're pushing round,  
This towns respectable and clean,  
Just look around you'll see what I mean.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Down home town, down home town,  
  
[Chorus]  
  
We got the best town band around,  
Just listen to their crazy sound.  
When they get hot they gonna blow,  
You see them winnin' every show.  
Down home town, down home town [Repeat]  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Look out

One, two, three...  
  
Tell me I'm mistaken  
I must be kinda slow  
But the only time you ever cared  
Was when you needed more ... easy money, easy money  
You got out of control and you sold your soul for easy money  
  
If you see a sucker standing at your door  
Bring him in and make him grin  
Then take him to the store  
Easy money, easy money  
Watch out from above  
You broke into the bank of love  
Easy money  
  
Some people never learn to stop when they've had enough  
Easy money, easy money  
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough  
  
I've come to the conclusion it's like the old man said  
The only thing you gave me was shit and promises  
Easy money, whoa whoa whoa, easy money  
One day you'll have to earn all the money that you burn  
Easy money  
  
Take it, Jeff ....  
  
Easy money  
  
Wha, wha, yeah  
  
Some people never learn to stop when they've had enough  
Easy money, easy money  
Some people only have to shop when the going gets tough  
  
Funny thing about it  
Don't even make me blue  
'Cause there's no better deal around  
Than saying goodbye to you  
Easy money, easy money  
  
You snatched that cash right into your stash, easy money  
You got out of control and you sold your soul for easy money  
Easy money, woo woo woo, easy money

Here it comes another lonely day.  
Playing the game, I'll sail away  
On a voyage of no return to see  
If eternal life is meant to be,  
And if I find the key, to the eternal dream.  
The painted ladies of the Avalon.  
Play in the sun, take to the road  
To the north there lies the chills of cold,  
To the south there lies, the tales  
untold,  
But in between their lies, the place  
to close your eyes.  
  
And I will stay, I'll not be back,  
Eldorado,  
I will be free, of the world  
Eldorado  
  
Say goodbye the city's heroes sing  
Bird on the wind,  
Feel, feel so free  
Through the life upon the rooftop  
haze,  
All the cheating and the broken days,  
So through it all I see,  
There's nothing left for me.  
  
And I will stay, I'll not be back,  
Eldorado,  
I will be free, of the world  
Eldorado  
  
Sitting here on top of everywhere,  
What do I care,  
Days never end.  
I know the voyage's end will soon  
be here,  
No eternal life is here for me,  
And now I found the key,  
To the eternal dream.  
  
Then I will stay, I'll not be back,  
Eldorado.  
I will be free, of the world,  
Eldorado  

Bye bye, pretty woman  
I've got to leave you now  
I find you never really cared  
  
Stand back, take a look at you  
You couldn't care if you wanted to  
You keep saying it's gonna change  
But every time it comes back again  
It's a merry-go-round  
  
Endless lies shine in your eyes  
  
It's alright, count to ten  
It will all be better then  
It's alright, the world will go away  
  
Stand back, take a look at you  
You couldn't care if you wanted to  
You keep saying it's gonna change  
But every time it comes back again  
It's a merry-go-round  
  
Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes  
The heartbreak is, if you could only see  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
Endless tears that flowed through the years  
You take it all, and then you take some more  
Then you come running back to me  
  
Play on, pretty music  
Play on and on for me  
Shine on, silver stars  
Over the sea  
  
Endless lies, I can see it in your eyes  
The heartbreak is, if you could only see  
That's not the way it's supposed to be  
  
Endless lies shine in your eyes

I've got rocket for your parade  
Heavy breathing for you made in the shade  
I've got an itch that just won't quit  
I see in that dress that just don't fit  
I see you walking with that twobit boy  
I see you laughing but I'm no toy  
  
I know what you do every night every night  
I know what you do when you turn out the light  
I see what you do every night every night  
And I want you to do it to me  
  
You learned that jive on MTV  
That mumbo jumbo just don't work on me  
Slam bang baby ala kazam  
Don't disrespect me I'm a stand-up man  
I see you laughing when you slam the door  
I see you with him I can't take any more  
  
Come to your senses baby  
Don't hold out  
Someday you'll want me don't act so proud  
We've got a mutual circumstance  
Come on, hold on, give me a chance

You made a fool of me,  
But them broken dreams have got to end.  
  
Hey, woman, you got the blues,  
'Cause you ain't got no one else to use.  
There's an open road that leads nowhere,  
So just make some miles between here and there.  
There's a hole in my head where the rain comes in.  
You took my body and played to win.  
Ha, ha, woman, it's a cryin' shame,  
But you ain't got nobody else to blame.  
  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
  
Rolled in from another town,  
Hit some gold, too hard to settle down.  
But a fool and his money soon go sep'rate ways,  
And you found a fool lyin' in a daze.  
Ha, ha, woman, what you gonna do,  
You destroyed all the virtues that the Lord gave you.  
It's so good that you're feelin' pain,  
But you better get your face on board the very next train.  
  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
  
Evil woman, how you done me wrong,  
But now you're tryin' to wail a diff'rent song.  
Ha, ha, funny, how you broke me up.  
You made the wine, now you drink a cup.  
I came runnin' ev'ry time you cried,  
Thought I saw love smilin' in your eyes.  
Ha, ha, very nice to know  
That you ain't got no place left to go.  
  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.  
Evil woman.

Wildflowers grow everywhere  
Vibrations flow, things will have to change  
(good evening, madam. It's a recording. Yes.)  
Strange new ideas fill the air  
Some people leave, others grieve  
Some were bare but things will change  
Old concepts go, new ones grow  
All at once the world begins to love again  
(..... Hello uncle bill)  
And the wildflowers grow out of fields  
  
Fields of people  
There's no such thing as a weed  
Seeds of hatred  
Plant them and soon they will breed  
  
(going to the pub, are you? Evening madam.)

(here we are now in great portland street. Ah, good evening sir, I  
Wonder would you like to come over here and say a few words in the  
Microphone. Oh. It catches one a bit off balance suddenly to be  
Interrupted in the street. I got one. Hello, I don't wanna taxi. What I  
Want is this. You're a tazi driver, and we wanna taxi drivers opinion  
On pop music. I think it's very good mate. Just cause I gettin a bit  
Anciant don't mean to say I don't enjoy it. Good. Toot your organ and  
Well be away.)  
  
(hold it. One more time, it's a bit ragged. Try one more. Here we go.)

No one can say  
How she caught my eyes  
To this day  
I don't know why  
Oh well, her eyes  
So much like diamonds  
And her heart  
So much like gold  
I knew that I'd win her in time  
When I felt her heart beat close to mine  
And once in her arms  
Then I knew anything I would do  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
I prayed that I'd never have to walk alone  
I have a love of my own  
I thank my stars  
I found an angel  
Never again  
Will I walk alone  
She brought a light  
Into my heart  
Like the brightest star  
That's ever shone  
Money and gold to a king  
When you're alone, don't mean a thing  
And once in her arms  
Then I knew anything I would do  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
I prayed that I'd never have to walk alone  
I have a love of my own  
I could paint a masterpiece  
I could walk through fire  
I could shout it from the roof  
From the smallest flame to a fire this love has grown  
Just for the love of a woman  
Money and gold mean nothin'  
Never again will I have to walk alone  
Since I have a love of my own  
Now I have a love of my own  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
Just for the love of a woman  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  
Love of my own, love of my own  
I can't face this world all alone  

I used to think she was the greatest thing  
I really cared, gave her a diamond ring  
She said she'd rather die than ever leave me  
Well I never saw her face since then  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
She must be somewhere on the open road  
She always said she was a lonely one  
She gets you down with her tales of woe  
She took me for everything  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn  
But she was gone with the night  
I thought about the things she said  
And all the things we'd done  
But where could she run- she ran away  
There's just no answer to give  
  
I keep wonderin' about her, day and night  
She probably thinks I was a fool- she's right  
She don't know it  
But I'm gonna keep on searchin' for that woman  
I'm gonna search everywhere  
And if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  
  
I looked around I climbed up high into the dawn  
But she was gone with the night  
I thought about the things she said  
And all the things we'd done  
But where could she run- she ran away  
There's just no answer to give  
  
I still hear her callin' out to me  
I still listen for her endlessly  
But it never even crossed my mind she was a cheater  
I gotta find where she hides  
'Cause if the law don't get her then I will  
Four little diamonds  

Oh you,you're so hard to get to,  
Oh you,you don't want to play,  
You were no better before,  
I sent a letter before,  
I sent a dream to you last night  
From the end of the world.  
  
Oh you,you keep me hangin' 'round and 'round  
And 'round,  
Oh you,look at the trouble I've found  
You were no better before  
I sent a letter before,  
I sent a dream to you last night  
From the end of the world.  
  
I saw you last night but you couldn't answer,  
You were a lonely little sidewalk dancer,  
When I woke up I could not stand it  
You were gone but I got to hand it to you.  
  
Oh please if this is a game I wish someone would win  
Oh please just let it fly to be upon the wind  
You were no better before,I sent a letter before  
I sent a dream to you baby last night  
From the end of the world

Listen to me sister, I got news from the governor,  
And he's heard people shouting from the towers in the city  
While their babies grow in test tubes over night  
  
Run and fetch the priest cos there's a light on in the building  
And there's sounds blowin out in the music of the night  
And we should try to get the people out alive  
  
Movin 'cross the ocean with the flag of death a'flyin  
The demon butcher pointin out the message on the tide  
And the demon light a'sailin at his side  
  
Stormin down the airwaves comes the protest and the prayin  
And the love that shone down from the sun to world  
No longer could support the life it gave

It's out of control, And there's nothing I can do now  
Out of control, spinning softly through the blue now  
And look beyond these walls as the meaning starts to dawn  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point  
  
It's out of control, nothing I can do  
Like a fire that keeps on burning  
And nobody knows what I'm going through  
And the thoughts just keep returning  
And all you had to say, was that you were gonna stay  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point  
  
It's getting to the point where nobody can stop it now  
It's getting to the point of no return  
And all that I can do is stand and watch it now  
watch it burn, burn, burn  
It's getting to the point where reasons are forgotten  
It's getting to the point where no one knows  
And all that I can do is say I'm sorry, but that's the way it goes  
It's getting to the point  
  
Forever is a long way, forever takes your breath away  
I'd like to talk about it, try to understand  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point  
It's out of control, nothing I can do  
Like a fire that keeps on burning  
And nobody knows what I'm going through  
And the thoughts just keep returning  
And all you had to say, was that you were gonna stay  
It's getting to the point, getting to the point  

You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane  
You broke my will, oh what a thrill  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
You came on over and took over my heart  
You came along and moved me honey  
I cannot lie you are so fine  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
Kiss me baby, Who, feels good  
Come on over baby, Love me like a lover should  
Your fine, so kind, told this world that your mine, mine, mine  
  
You pull my fingers and you twiddle my thumbs  
want to love you but a true love huh  
Come on baby, your drive me crazy  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
Kiss me baby, who, feels good  
Ahh call me baby, love me like a lover should  
Your fine, so kind, want to tell this world that your mine, mine, mine  
  
You pull my fingers and you twiddle my thumbs  
want to love you but it sure is hard  
Come one baby, you drive me crazy  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
You shake my nerves and you rattle my brain  
Too much love drives a man insane  
You broke my will, oh what a thrill  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire  
  
You get me lonely and you get all my money  
You came alone and your with me honey  
Come on baby you drive ah me crazy  
Goodness gracious, great balls of fire

Verse  
They say there's gold under the stone  
They say there's fire in the ice  
They say that love is crazy it's true  
But what can a poor man do  
When he's burned by someone like you  
Chorus  
In your heart of hearts  
Is this romance over  
In your heart of hearts  
Is there nothing I can do  
You made a fool out of this desperate lover  
In your heart of hearts  
Don't push me away  
In your heart of hearts  
Don't you want me to stay  
Verse  
Days of love mean nothing to you  
Night of romance and fire  
What went wrong with this paradise  
What turned the gold to stone  
What turned the fire to ice  
Chorus  
In your heart of hearts  
Is this romance over  
In your heart of hearts  
Is there nothing I can do  
You made a fool out of this desperate lover  
In your heart of hearts  
Don't push me away  
In your heart of hearts  
Don't you want me to stay  
Verse  
You can take the fire away  
But the flame burns hotter  
You can take the love away  
But the memory's stronger every day  
Can't stop it, can't help it  
I'll never forget about you  

We're just a stone's throw  
From burning hellfire  
Does anybody know  
Where did all the heroes go?  
  
We've had our fill of  
This gallery of scoundrels  
The leaders of the world  
Those power hungry liars  
  
Rise up and sound the sirens  
Send out the searching parties  
All we need is a few good men  
  
Send the S. O. S. And red alerts  
All across the universe  
Calling all honest men?  
  
S. O. S. Emergency  
Sinking fast and getting worse  
Where's your honest men?  
  
In some village far away  
Or in a little town pub  
High on a mountain top  
There must be an honest man  
Calling all honest men  
  
Throw out the tyrants  
The aged fat cats  
Outlived their usefulness  
They have led us to this mess  
  
Make them answer  
Hold them to their promises  
And throw them in the street  
If they won't tell the truth  
  
S. O. S. And red alert  
All across the universe  
Calling all honest men  
(Calling all honest men)  
  
S. O. S. Emergency  
Sinking fast and getting worse  
Where's your honest men?  
(Where's your honest men?)  
To your stations  
Man the ramparts  
The barricades  
  
We need new heroes urgently  
We need a few good honest men  
Calling all honest men  
Calling all honest men  
  
Call to him  
He lives next door  
Across the street  
On the upper floor  
It's our only hope we need him now  
  
Send the S. O. S. And red alert  
All across the universe  
Calling all honest men  
(Calling all honest men)  
  
S. O. S. Emergency  
Sinking fast and getting worse  
Where's your honest men  
(Where's your honest men?)  
  
Strike a blow, save the ship  
We need a few good honest men  
Calling all honest men  
Calling all honest men  
  
S. O. S. Across the universe  
Where's your honest  
We need your honest  
Calling all honest men  
  
Calling out all over the world  
(Sending out an S. O. S.)  
Where's your honest men  
Looking out all over the world  
(Sending out to save the world)  
We need your honest men  
  
Calling out all over the world  
(Sending out an S. O. S.)  
Where's your honest men  
Looking out all over the world  
(Sending out to save the world)  
We need your honest men  
  
Honest men, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
Save the world, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
  
Honest men, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
Save the world, ooh  
Calling all honest men  
  
Ooh, calling all honest men  
Ooh, calling all honest men

On the seven seas there was aphantom ship acoming,  
Shinin' in the dead of night,  
I heard the crew a hummin'  
Tunes that sounded like the Rolling Stones and Leonard Cohen.  
But they didn't know the words,  
So I assumed that they was foreign.  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach 'em,  
I just want to please 'em, doctor let me teach 'em.  
  
I looked up in the sky there was a phantom plane a comin',  
Shinin' in the dead of night,  
I heard the pilot saying,  
Poems that were written by John Keats and Robert Browning.  
But he didn't know the words so,  
I suppose that it was nothing.  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach 'em,  
I just want to please 'em, doctor let me teach 'em.  
  
Doctor please believe me, I know you won't decieve me,  
But do these things I'm seein', have any hidden meaning.  
It's all good entertainment and it doesn't cost a penny.  
So please doc, let me teach 'em, if I could only reach 'em.  
  
But I heard them just the same doctor let me teach 'em,  
I just want to please 'em, doctor let me teach 'em.

I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
I'm alive - and the dawn breaks across the sky  
I'm alive - and the sun rises up so high  
Lost in another world (far away), never another word (till today)  
But what can I say? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
Suddenly came the dawn (from the night), suddenly I was born (into light)  
How can it be real? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
I'm alive - and the world shines for me today  
I'm alive - suddenly I am here today  
Seems like forever (and a day), thought I could never (feel this way)  
Is this really me? I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  
(Instrumental break)  
  
I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive  
  

Listen to the money talk  
Listen to it scream  
Only lots of paper  
But it haunts them in their dreams.  
  
Doesn't matter who they are  
Doesn't matter where  
Some people can't get enough  
That is their only care.  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill.  
  
Sitting in a darkened room  
Sharing out the land  
Someone holds a document  
And smiles as they shake hands.  
  
Going in for the kill  
In for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill.  
  
Everywhere you wander,  
Wander where you will  
Someone's making deals  
And going in for the kill.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill, in for the slaughter  
In for the thrill of the power game  
In for the kill, in for the finish  
They've got to win, it's the only way.  
  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill  
In for the kill...

Doom, gloom and misery  
That's what you gave to me  
Cold, tight, late and mean  
Beyond my wildest dreams  
  
Now that it's over  
And the sun came out to shine  
  
Don't look for me  
'Cause I set myself free  
In my own time  
  
New days have come along  
And now I'm at where I belong  
Blue sky shines above  
And I got someone to love  
  
Now I think about it  
Lifts the clouds from my mind  
Goin' out on the sea  
Getting further from me  
  
In my own time  
My own time  
  
Bye, bye, bye, bye  
Is that a tear in your eye  
Too late to cry  
You and your precious disguise  
  
Sometimes I wonder if I ever saw the sign  
But it's too late to care  
'Cause I've done that, been there  
In my own time  
  
So don't look for me  
'Cause I set myself free  
In my own time  
In my own time

Down, down, you can see them all  
Rising gaily to the top  
Keep on rising babe you know you got a long drop  
You better cling cos it's the done thing  
  
Down, down, at the policemans ball  
They're all dancing in a line  
Keep on gruntin boys you know you're doin fine  
Come quickly i've been strangled  
  
Down, down, at the military  
They're all marching round and round  
Keep them boots shined and that still upper lip down  
Ablution revolution  
  
Down, down, at the launching pad  
Giant phallus stands erect  
Ten thousand tons of waste throb then eject  
Look out space, we're gonna change our place  
  
Down, down, in old england town  
There was air and now there's smoke  
Let's build more cars and drive away before we choke  
Suddenly it's always night time  
  
Down, down, at that nice trade fair  
All the money gone astray  
Let's inflate this price and float away  
Just you and me and everyone...

Dear Jo:  
I don't know where to begin so I'll just hello  
Dear Jo:  
Is it so much better now you're on your own?  
(Is it alright?) you never believed in yourself  
(Is it alright?) but now that you're free, does it help?  
  
Is it alright?  
Now that you've got what you want?  
And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?  
  
Dear Jo:  
Are you living it up every place you go?  
Dear Jo:  
If you're having a hard time it sure don't show  
(Is it alright?) you couldn't hold on in your mind.  
(Is it alright?) now is it okay, is it fine?  
  
Is it alright?  
Now that you've got what you want?  
And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?  
  
Dear Jo:  
Can you believe that it's been so long?  
Dear Jo:  
Just thought I'd write and let you know  
(Is it alright?) you never believed in yourself  
(Is it alright?) but now that you're free, does it help?  
  
Is it alright?  
Now that you've got what you want?  
And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?  
  
Is it alright?  
Is it alright with you?  
Is it alright?  
Is it alright with you?  
  
Is it alright?  
Now that you've got what you want?  
And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?  
  
Is it alright?  
Now that you've got what you want?  
And is it alright?  
Now that you're back where you belong?

I spent some time across the waves  
I learned a lot of things I never could  
I waved my magic wand over the past  
I never understood  
  
It really doesn't matter at all  
It really doesn't matter at all  
If you found what you're lookin' for  
It really doesn't matter at all  
  
We strolled around on different ground  
There must have been some kind of reason  
Nothing ventured, nothing found  
Must have been the wrong season  
  
It really doesn't matter at all  
It really doesn't matter at all  
If you found what you're lookin' for  
It really doesn't matter at all  
  
I flew you high, I flew you low  
I flew you all the way around  
You played for me your pretty tune  
Now look what I have found  
  
It really doesn't matter at all  
It really doesn't matter at all  
If you found what you're lookin' for  
It really doesn't matter at all  
  
It really doesn't matter at all, doesn't matter at all  
It really doesn't matter at all, doesn't matter at all  
If you found what you're lookin' for, doesn't matter at all  
It really doesn't matter at all

Summer came and passed away,  
Hardly seemed to last a day  
But it's over and what can I do  
  
Music playin' in the air,  
Silence on a darkened stair  
'cos it's over and what can I do  
  
It's over, it's over, all over,  
It's all over now  
And the way you looked  
Don't even mean I'm down.  
When you kick out the sea  
And the sun says goodbye  
There is nothing much to speak of.  
  
Lookin' over sunny days,  
Searchin' for the righteous wave  
'cos it's over and what can I do  
  
Lookin' from this distant shore  
You ain't sailin' by no more  
'cos it's over and what can I do  
  
It's over, it's over, all over,  
It's all over now  
And the way you looked  
Don't even mean I'm down.  
When you kick out the sea  
And the sun says goodbye  
There is nothing much to speak of.  
  
Ah, it's over, it's over, it's over,  
It's all over and what can I do?  
Ah, it's over, it's over,  
It's all over.  

I wander through a town  
A town I new so well but it seems so strange  
The wind blows cold  
I remember when I thought your street was paved with gold  
I walked along the street  
A street I walked along many times before  
The things have changed  
Everything I knew was gone or rearranged  
  
Julie don't live here anymore  
She moved away many years before  
How can it be, this I can't believe  
Julie don't live here anymore  
  
I walked up to your door  
Last night I saw your face in the window  
But it was different now  
The lonely light where we used to be quite gone  
  
I though about your smile  
Your laughing eyes and the things you said to me  
I felt so sorry for you  
For all the nights we spent hanging around with nothing else to do  
  
Julie don't live here anymore  
She moved away many years before  
How can it be, this I can't believe  
Julie don't live here anymore  
  
Julie don't live here anymore  
She moved away many years before  
How can it be, this I can't believe  
Julie don't live here anymore  
  
Julie don't live here anymore  
Julie don't live here anymore  
Julie don't live here anymore

I could paint your picture in the sky tonight  
Your lips stick on the moon in pastel light  
Baby, it's full and white  
Honey, it's full tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
So kiss me red  
Kiss me rouge  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth  
Oh  
  
I could paint your picture in my room tonight  
Your body's on my mind, it's full and white  
Oh, but you're far away  
And what I wouldn't pay  
  
[Chorus]  
To kiss you red  
Kiss you rouge  
Kiss you rough  
Kiss you smooth  
Oh  
  
It's black out  
And I'm afraid of the dark  
So I light a candle to replace your heart  
What I wouldn't give to have you here in my bed  
  
[Chorus]  
To kiss me red  
Kiss me rouge  
Kiss me rough  
Kiss me smooth

I listened to the whine for way too long  
Time for me to hear a different song  
I waited overtime for things to turn around  
Tired of waiting for it all to hit the ground  
  
You said you knew all about it  
What was right and what was wrong  
You pulled the wool over the eyes of everyone  
Maybe I was weak when I should've been strong  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
You took me by surprise and like a shot in the dark, shot in the dark  
You showed yourself in your truest light, truest light  
You saved yourself by saving nobody else  
You must have cringed when you heard them tell  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
You took the wrong turn at the city of dreams, city of dreams  
You ended up back where you came from it seems, came from it seems  
Back there to where there's nothing else to do  
Back there where you can sit and think of only you  
  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry, baby, cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
Cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
Cry  
Tell me 'bout your lonesome lullaby  
  
Your lonesome lullaby

They used to tell me boy you ain't goin' nowhere  
With your cheap guitar and your big long hair  
You gotta realize all your responsibilities  
You gotta get out to work and face reality  
  
You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road  
  
So I drifted for a while down the road to ruin  
I couldn't find my way I didn't know what I was doin'  
I saw a lot of people coming back the other way  
So I kept on goin' when I heard them say  
  
"You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road"  
  
I made a lot of money I was makin' quite a mess  
But they all told me money wouldn't bring me happiness  
"You gotta work like a man in a real man's life  
You're gonna have to take all the trouble and strife"  
  
You gotta get up in the morning take your heavy load  
And you gotta keep goin' down the long black road

She came up from the country with a smile for everyone  
She left her blue horizon just to find another home  
A lonely girl who'd traveled many days  
A lonely heart that could not find the way  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near  
Momma, it's a sad and lonely life  
  
A misty morning rider, she came wanderin' through the hills  
A wanderin' soul appearin' over rainy window sills  
A loser in her heart but in her face  
A smile for everyone under God's grace  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near  
Momma, it's a sad and lonely life  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
  
Midnight maiden madness, what to search for in this place'  
Gateway to the city, night sky shadows on her face  
A lady lost in nowhere but her stare  
Leaves the world, her life to start somewhere  
  
And she said, "Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone"  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near  
  
Momma, it's a hard life now you're gone  
Momma, it's so hard to carry on  
And I feel I'm a fool who lost it all  
You used to make it all so very clear  
That life must go on though the end is near

Sun is shinin' in the sky  
There ain't a cloud in sight  
It's stopped rainin' everybody's in a play  
And don't you know  
It's a beautiful new day hey  
  
Runnin' down the avenue  
See how the sun shines bright in the city  
On the streets where once was pity  
Mister blue sky is living here today hey  
  
Mister blue sky please tell us why  
You had to hide away for so long, so long  
Where did we go wrong?  
  
Mister blue sky please tell us why  
You had to hide away for so long, so long  
Where did we go wrong?  
  
Hey you with the pretty face  
Welcome to the human race  
A celebration, mister blue sky's up there waitin'  
And today is the day we've waited for ohhh ah.  
  
Mr. Blue Sky please tell us why you had to hide away for so long, so long.
Where did we go wrong?  
  
Hey there mister blue

Mister blue sky, Mister blue sky why

But soon comes mister night creepin' over  
Now his hand is on your shoulder  
Never mind I'll remember you this  
I'll remember you this way  
  
Mister blue sky please tell us why  
You had to hide away for so long so long  
Where did we go wrong?  
  
Hey there mister blue  
We're so pleased to be with you  
Look around see what you do  
Everybody smiles at you  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba ba  
  
Mister blue sky why?

Ventrilloquist was he, little boy sat on his knee  
The people knew that the show was but the best one in the land  
Until the night before the act  
The dummy's clothes had all been packed away - he'd gone  
And he'd left poor mr. crow right in the lurch  
  
You know he's gone far away  
I hear his voice go laughing  
What of all the years we shared?  
  
Hello mr. crow has your little boy left home - did he run away  
Well i hope he'll soon be back to do the show  
I'm sorry you must feel quite sad when your dummy runs away without a word  
That is all old mr. crow had heard  
  
You know he's gone far away  
I hear his voice go laughing  
What of all the years we shared?  
  
Now come on mr. crow my dear  
We'd better have this gottle o' geer  
  
Then one fateful night into the dressing room so bright  
Walked our friend tabledoll  
Mr. crow cried tears of joy all in his tea  
The bad doll said kindly address me as sir norman little man i am a star  
And if you weren't so old maybe i'd let you be my doll  
  
You know i've been far away  
I've heard the people laugh  
Now i'm a great big star

Hello, Mr. Radio, you friendly station,  
So glad of your company, your morning music,  
My wife she ran away, she left our home,  
And though you're here with me, I'm on my own.  
  
Hello, Mr. Radio, you friendly speaker,  
You played my request today, request to see her  
Your voice comes riding home across the air,  
You travel 'round the world, but still you're here.  
  
I heard on the news today the world is no good,  
But if she returns today mine could be so good  
I look into the sky, your waves rush by,  
The weather man has lied, it makes me cry.  
  
Hello, Mr. Radio, do I disturb you?  
Sometimes I forget my place, I seem to know you  
I miss you when you close, you'll never know,  
And when your programs go, I'm on my own.

On friday afternoon at three o'clock  
A passing lady looked into a shop  
Her eyes lit up as this the sign she read  
Recruiting office, that is what it said  
  
Exacitedly she stepped inside to see  
How her sons would fair if they were militry  
The man in charge to her was very sweet  
And said, " please sign here on this little sheet"  
  
But when she got home her mind grew many fears  
The message from the soldiers in the war rang in her ears  
  
Don't put your boys in the army mrs. Ward  
You know they'll only waste away, oh oh  
Don't put your boys in the army mrs. Ward  
You know they'll only waste away, oh oh  
  
At six o'clock the lads came home from work  
She told them what she'd done, they went beserk  
We'll have to go to war and fight and die  
And mrs. Ward she wiped a tear from her eye  
  
Don't put your boys in the army mrs. Ward  
You know they'll only waste away, oh oh  
  
Don't put your boys in the army mrs. Ward  
You know they'll only waste away, oh oh  
Don't put your boys in the army mrs. Ward  
You know they'll only waste away, oh oh  
  
Don't put your boys in the army mrs. Ward  
You know they'll only waste away, oh oh  
Don't put your boys in the army mrs. Ward  
You know they'll only waste away, oh oh

She gives me love that I could never hope to have,  
She tells me that she needs me,she tells me that she's glad,  
And if she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
She came in from the west, a summer breeze I couldn't rest,  
I had to take a fast train, to be there by her side,  
She made me feel so good, she made it like it should be all the time  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
Just when I was thinkin' of her, she came along and made me  
want her. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.  
  
If she goes away, I'm like someone who's left out in the rain,  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
The boats that sail, the planes that fly,she is with me.  
I wonder if she wonders, if this is all for real,  
I couldn't stand to see her cry because of me, that would be sad.  
I need, I need her, I need her love.  
  
She tells me everything, she makes me smile, she tries to sing,  
But never shares her suffering, if things are going wrong,  
She makes it like a dream, if things are as they seem the  
world is good. I need her love, I need her love, I need her love.  

Who thanked the Lord for the clothes  
That she wore and mended,  
Nellie with the big old fashioned eyes  
  
Who won the heart of a crowd  
Tore apart, took a bow,  
Nellie there's a different world backstage  
  
[Chorus:]  
I see the flood lights burning  
I hear the band play on  
Now Nellie takes her bow  
  
She said she really could not stay  
She had a brand new play to play  
And so she paints her face and smiles  
And she'll be someone else in a while  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Just a lonely girl who could not face a broken world,  
And so she acts out all her dreams and wishes that's how it had been  
But when the audience is near, it seems as though she doesn't even care.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nellie just sent me a line to tell me she was doing fine  
She got the lead and on Broadway, and now they're digging her today  
And as she turns the final page, living  
Someone's life upon the stage  
  
[Chorus]

New dawn, smiling down the old blue world  
Can you feel it like the first of spring?  
The bells are ringing out a little tune for you  
  
Daylight, everyone hears the sound  
Hey, goodmornin', how you doin'? Well, I'm doin' fine  
It's nearly nine, I must be gone  
  
I see no sorrow now  
Nobody has a care  
  
Hey there, why don't you join me? I'll be glad to know you  
Take some time out, would you like to work or play  
Or wander slowly through this bright new day?  
  
Everyone laughs, can't believe what's goin' on 'round here  
New world risin', everybody kicked their blues away  
Not for today but evermore  
  
I see no sorrow now  
Nobody has a care  
  
New day, smiling down on the world  
Can you feel it like the first of spring?  
The bells are ringing out a little tune for you

Standin' at the airport  
Lookin' down the strip,  
She was cryin' her eyes,  
She was bitin' her lip.  
747 just left from gate eleven  
And there's no turnin' round  
'cos it's just leavin' the ground  
And gettin' higher.  
  
Standin' at the dock-side  
  
Lookin' out to sea  
When I saw her there  
But she did not see me.  
There she stood with no hope  
Because she'd missed the boat  
And as her dreams sailed away  
She headed back for the day,  
Back to the city.  
  
Night in the city, oh oh oh,  
Madness at midnight,  
Night in the city  
Drivin' you insane.  
  
I was runnin' kinda lonely  
At the city place.  
I waited for an hour,  
Never saw her face.  
Crazy ladies that wait  
And slide around like a snake  
I just can't take anymore,  
I'm going in through the door  
Into the city.  
  
Night in the city, oh oh oh,  
Madness at midnight,  
Night in the city  
Drivin' you insane.

I remember somewhere in the rain,  
the faces of the passers-by, staring faces, broken blinds,  
I recall the situation clearly standing in a crowded car,  
I can feel the need in me.  
  
Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider  
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,  
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.  
  
I still see that vision of delight,  
While cruising on the black of night,  
but she keeps a step ahead  
Looking out the corner of her world, nobody ever knows a girl,  
who once lived along this way.  
  
Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider  
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,  
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.  
  
Desolation degradation row,  
Go on don't let the feeling show,  
She's a ten a penny dream,  
Faces with no name no address, keep staring in on my distress  
But she kills me with her smile.  
  
Hold on, nightrider baby, hold on you're a nightrider  
Riding the night, searching for what is gone,  
Never reaching the end, so you must travel on.

Can't you see I'm shaking in my shoes  
I've done everything but I still got the blues  
Everywhere I turn there's misery  
Stuck in the middle of nowhere street  
  
Go away come back where ya goin'  
Don't do that, do this, don't you blow it  
Run don't walk, shout don't talk about it  
You don't know anything about it  
  
It's no good there's no way out  
No way out  
A fine affair and there's no doubt  
There's no doubt  
That there's no way out, no way out  
  
She left some money in a paper sack  
And a note to say she ain't coming back  
It's no good there's no way out  
A fine affair and there's no doubt  
But there's no way out, no way out  
  
They're coming at me from everywhere  
They say she's already gone from here  
  
Go away come back where ya goin'  
Don't do that, do this, don't you blow it  
Run don't walk, shout don't talk about it  
You don't know anything about it  
  
It's no good there's no way out  
No way out  
A fine affair and there's no doubt  
That there's no way out, no way out  
  
No way out  
No way out  
No way out  
No way out

Susan spent the weekend at her stately home  
Crying at the lions on the garden wall  
And then she'd sigh - sneak away  
Look at her style - free the day  
  
Oh no not me - I wouldn't  
Oh no not me - I couldn't  
That's all she says, her money and her place  
They just don't mean a thing  
  
Susan met the lords and dukes of everywhere  
Smiling kissing wishing that they'd go to hell  
And then she'd laugh - wonder why  
Take a nap - sit and cry  
  
Oh no not me - I wouldn't  
Oh no not me - I couldn't  
That's all she says, her money and her place  
They just don't mean a thing

There she is I'm sure I seen her  
Pushing in the queue to get to the front  
Join the ladies in my dream  
I know that nothing hurts you babe  
In my balance in a way  
  
Chorus  
  
Come and take a ride on my omnibus  
We could take you right to the terminus  
Don't forget your ticket if you want to ride  
(catching a ride)  
If you want to go inside  
  
Just a dud their hansom falter [?]  
Harem on a bus flies over the top  
... Jeans  
Lock up your daughters  
  
Just too late to save the day  
Ring my bell and turn away  
  
Chorus  
  
Sweet silver meadows  
Protect us from the rain  
Please never break  
Take us to the stars again  
Hear the ways for every where  
See my sleighs win the air  
  
Save the girls upstairs for later  
Now you wonder if I can manage them all  
Wrap them up in christmas paper  
Tell them they don't have to pay  
Ring my bell and turn away  
  
Chorus  
  
Omnibus ride  
Omnibus ride

Deep waters flow, out to the sea,  
They never needed you or me.  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Blue mountains high and valley low,  
I don't know which way I should go,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Warm summer breeze blows endlessly,  
Touching the hearts of those who feel,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
  
Bird on wing goes floating by,  
But there's a teardrop in his eye,  
One summer dream, one summer dream.  
One summer dream, one summer dream.

I couldn't really understand at all  
The writing on the wall  
From you to me  
  
A jigsaw puzzle of a twisted tale  
That set its lonely sail  
From you to me  
  
'Cause I tried to get the message  
But it's not understood  
Wide apart and so far away  
It mattered at the start until I realized instead ....  
  
I'm flying in a troubled sky  
Watching you as you go by  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm sailing on a troubled sea  
Watching you as you watch me  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I couldn't understand a word it said  
The letter that I read  
From you to me  
  
I couldn't fathom out the stuff you wrote  
So I guess it's just a joke  
From you to me  
  
Though reality keeps calling me away from my dream  
And the wreckage isn't all it might have been  
Didn't matter at the start until I realized it did  
  
I'm flying in a troubled sky  
Watching you as you go by  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm sailing on a troubled sea  
Watching you as you watch me  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm floating in a troubled sky  
Watching you as you go by  
In an ordinary dream  
  
I'm sailing on a troubled sea  
Watching you as you watch me  
In an ordinary dream  
  
Ordinary dream  
  
Ordinary dream

Away, the joker's closing in,  
Reform and they will win,  
The light is fading fast.  
I know, you know, they know, we all know,  
Everybody's gonna burn down.  
  
The girls come crawling on all fours,  
Banging on locked doors,  
High cards call the tune.  
I know, you know, they know, we all know,  
Everybody's gonna burn down.  
  
Play me another hand,  
Loose everything I am,  
Until we meet again.  
  
The ace, that's hiding up your sleeve,  
Will cause the world to grieve,  
The love you had is gone,  
I know you know, they know, we all know.  
  
The dream, in every player's heart,  
To win it all not part,  
They lie awake at night,  
I know, you know, they know, we all know.  
  
The game, where gamblers rule the night,  
And get your blood they might,  
The joker's closin' in,  
I know, you know, they know, we all know.

Me I'm just a poor boy, from across the far southland,  
And I've traveled many days to reach this place to mke my stand,  
I fell in with a merry band, and drank away the hours.  
  
Chorus  
Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on,  
And my head is high, from the battle won,  
Laid down my life for the greenwood  
  
The city boys, and the country boys, they come from miles around,  
To defy their king and country, save the poor folks from the hand,  
Of the thieving dukes and abbotts, and the gentry of the land.  
  
Chorus  
Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on,  
And my head is high, from the battle won,  
Laid down my life for the greenwood  
  
Sweet maid marion, don't you do me no wrong,  
Stay on the right side, the greenwood is your home,,  
The dancing girls and the open fires, the wine that flows like water.  
  
Chorus  
Rollin' on, I've been rollin' on,  
And my head is high, from the battle won,  
Laid down my life for the greenwood

Early in the morning  
The sun was up and the sky was very blue,  
Without a warning,  
As I looked out, my thoughts returned to you,  
A noise in the city made the children run,  
And hide themselves away,  
And thunder boomed and lightning filled the sky.  
  
Looking from this window,  
A thousand rivers running past my door,  
Standing on an islane, looking for someone,  
Upon the shore,  
I can see it very clearly nothing's really changed,  
Then lightning strikes across an empty sky.  
  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Will it wash away the lonely tears,  
  
With their brand new time transporter,  
They'll think maybe I fought to get away,  
But with all their great inventions,  
And all their good intentions, here I stay,  
Down on the corner where the sun had shone,  
The people gathered 'round,  
Then scattered as the raindrops hit the ground.  
  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Ooohh, the rain is falling  
Will it wash away the lonely tears.  

Listen everybody let me tell you 'bout the rock 'n' roll  
Feel that rhythm and it's really gonna thrill your soul  
She said come along with me, to a land of make believe  
She said rock 'n' roll is king  
  
She loves that rock 'n' roll and she plays it all night long  
That's all she ever tells me when I call her on the telephone  
She says feel that jumpin' beat, and git up on your feet  
She says rock 'n' roll is king  
  
Oh let those guitars play  
Play for me play for me  
Oh let that song ring out  
That's how it's meant to be  
  
It rolls like a train that's comin' on down the track  
She rolled over Beethoven and she gave Tchaikovsky back  
She loves that drivin' beat, she goes dancin' on down the street  
She said rock 'n' roll is king  
  
Oh let those guitars play  
Play for me play for me  
Oh let that song ring out  
That's how it's meant to be  
  
When she comes around and I'm listenin' to the radio  
She says you can't do that 'cause all I wanna do is rock 'n' roll  
Now here I'm gonna stay where that music starts to play  
She says rock 'n' roll is king  

I don't know  
I don't know what's on your mind  
I thought everything was fine  
But it was my surprise  
  
I don't know  
I don't know what's going on  
Something surely must be wrong  
You're living secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Wish I knew  
Wish I knew where I fit in  
Wish that I knew everything  
About your secret lives  
  
If it means  
If it means that much to you  
I don't want to stop the things you do  
I don't need alibis  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
I don't care  
I don't care what goes on there  
So long as one day I can share  
Share your secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Living secret lives, secret lives  
And I wonder where she goes to in the night  
In secret lives  
  
Secret lives, secret lives  
Secret lives, secret lives

A moving stream of information  
That is floating on the wind  
The secrets never end  
And now they call,  
They sing, they play, they dance  
For you, from out of the blue,  
What can you do?  
  
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly  
They call to me across the air  
The messages across the atmosphere  
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere  
  
Where words cascade like rainbows tumbling from the sky  
Then I'll be there, I'll be there  
When messages will call to you their secrets all around  
Without a sound, they're all around  
  
Those secret messages that spill into the air from far away  
So far away  
A flowing river of illusion running with confusion  
Never gone - it goes on and on  
  
The secret messages are calling to me endlessly  
They call to me across the air  
The messages across the atmosphere  
They whisper in your ear, they're calling everywhere  

Sitting here, waiting for,  
Someone calling at my door,  
Too bad,  
I'm getting out of love.  
  
What's the use of changing things,  
Wonder what tomorrow brings,  
Who knows,  
I'm getting out of love.  
  
CHORUS  
My Shangri-la has gone away,  
Faded like the Beatles on Hey Jude  
She seemed to drift out on the rain  
That came in somewhere softly from the blue  
  
Clouds roll by and hide the sun,  
Raindrops fall on everyone,  
So sad,  
I'm getting out of love.  
  
CHORUS -- repeat x2

Although the things you've done I wouldn't criticize.  
I guess you had your way.  
You see I gotta make you understand.  
I know it sounds a foolish thing to say.  
But it don't matter baby 'cos' today's another day.  
  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life and let me see.  
  
Remember,tonight we're gonna run till dawn  
Remember,tonight we're gonna say.  
We'll never stop we got a good thing goin' on.  
I know you've heard it all before.  
But I really need you darlin' every day I need you more.  
  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life and let me see.  
  
Can you understand.(Yes I understand) Can you feel it's right.  
(I know it is) Will you be the same.(I'll do it all again).  
  
It's been a year now and it's getting so much better.  
You came home without a word.  
Though everybody said you'll soon forget her.  
Thay couldn't see and they just didn't understand.  
And lookin' in the mirror there were fools at either hand.  
  
Can you understand.(Yes I understand) Can you feel it's right.  
(I know it is) Will you be the same.(I'll do it all again).  
  
How many days had I been waiting there to tell you.  
I really can't believe.  
We're walkin' out into the world tonight.  
We'll do it all again until the break of light.  
And the feelin' in your heart will soon be shinin' in your eyes  
  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life  
You shine a little love on my life and let me see.  

She cried to the Southern wind  
About a love that was sure to end  
Every dream in her heart was gone  
Heading for a showdown.  
  
Bad dreamer, what's your name?  
Looks like we're riding on the same train  
Looks as though there'll be more pain  
There's gonna be a showdown.  
  
And it's raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
Tonight, the longest night.  
  
She came to me like a friend  
She blew in on the Southern wind  
Now my heart is turned to stone again  
There's gonna be a showdown.  
  
Save me, oh save me  
It's unreal, the suffering  
There's gonna be a showdown.  
  
And it's raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
Tonight, the longest night.  
  
(Raining, raining raining, raining)  
  
Raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
The longest night.  
  
And it's raining, all over the world  
Raining, all over the world  
Tonight, the longest night.  
  
You gotta save me, girl  
Well, I'm ready for saving  
I'm a fool for you  
Ya know I'm ready, come on and save me  
  
Can't you feel what you're doing to me, now?  
I'm on the run again.  
  
Gotta save me

Two drifters on the morning sky,  
Two drifters sailing wide and high,  
When summer breezes blow across your mind  
With you, I will walk the line.  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
  
People walking hand in hand  
Everybody's singing to the band  
I want to be where the stars shine bright  
And hear sweet music on a summer night  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
  
Sundowners we'll go on and on  
We'll find the land of the midnight sun  
And when you look you'll see for miles around  
You'll see the world is in your hand.  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
I want it so fine  
  

Stepping out of the shadows  
Im blinded by the light  
Therell be no more wasted days  
No more sleepless nights  
  
Stepping out of your shadow  
I finally see the light  
No more mister nice guy  
Im ready for the fight  
Weight off my shoulders  
No more tears to cry  
The chains are broken now  
I see through your disguise  
  
Chorus 1  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
Do you really think I'd just lay down and die  
  
No infatuation  
I don't believe your lies  
I can see clearly now  
The truth behind your eyes  
Weight off my shoulders  
No more tears to cry  
The chains are broken  
I see through your disguise  
  
Chorus 2  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
Im so glad you're gone  
So glad you said goodbye  
No more angry words, no chance for you to lie  
Did you really think I'd just lay down and die  
  
Passion fades away  
Love can turn to hate  
And all the words I want to say  
Are left in the hands of fate  
  
Chorus 2

Night after night, I try to make it all fit together  
Night after night, I see you as someone I remember  
You took me by surprise, opened up my eyes  
Now we gotta talk this over  
  
Can it really be so serious, to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess we've really been out of touch, but can it really be so serious  
  
Day after day, I know it's not the way that you wanted it  
Day after day, I try to find the key but it don't fit  
But you know how it is, no matter what I did  
We gotta talk it over  
  
Can it really be so serious, to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess we've really been out of touch, but can it really be so serious  
  
Tonight, tonight, I'm thinking over everything you said to me  
Tonight, tonight, I'm sorry but I just didn't see  
And now it's up to you, there's nothing else to do  
We've gotta talk it over  
  
Can it really be so serious, to be all broken up and delirious  
I guess we've really been out of touch, but can it really be so serious  

There's a silence in the city  
There's nobody around  
And everyone that we knew  
Moved to higher ground  
  
There's a shadow hanging overhead  
It lingers there alone  
Changing all we ever knew  
The changes start to show  
  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
  
There's a new sound in the wires  
And ears are to the ground  
And everything that once was ours  
Has slowly turned around  
  
Something happened to the seasons  
Started falling with the rain  
And something changed forever  
We gotta find a way  
  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
  
There's people in the photographs  
But they all had to run  
They went away to somewhere  
Beyond the setting sun  
  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
There's a sorrow about to fall  
  
Sorrow about to fall, fall, fall, fall  
Sorrow about to fall  
Sorrow about to fall  
Sorrow about to fall

Starlight, I hear you callin' out to me.  
Sweet love rollin' across my mind again.  
I want you, yes, I do, I need you, yes, I do.  
And then you run.  
  
You gotta stop foolin' around,  
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl,  
And starlight will shine all around, little girl.  
  
Starlight, your eyes are lookin' out so far away.  
Constellation in the sky is smiling down on me, I wonder, wonder why.  
I can feel you're so real, I can see you're so near  
And the you run.  
  
You gotta stop foolin' around,  
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl,  
And starlight will shine all around, little girl.  
You had me all the summer long, little girl.  
  
Moonglow, come light the way up to my window.  
As you roll across the night don't tell noby that I told you so.  
I want you, yes, I do, I need you, yes, I do.  
And then you run.  
  
You gotta stop foolin' around,  
Keep your feet on the ground, little girl,  
And starlight will shine all around, little girl.  
You had me all the summer long, little girl.  
  
[Repeat and fade...]  
Starlight, your eyes are lookin' down on me so far away.

Pack up all your things  
We're gonna be leaving  
Sooner than I thought  
Take the things you bought  
Clouds are gathering.  
  
Say goodbye to all your friends  
We're gonna be sorry  
For a while, that's how it goes  
But then again, who knows  
About the rain.  
  
I'm steppin' out  
I'm movin' on  
I'm gonna see the world  
Like a rollin' stone  
I'm gonna be somebody  
Oh, I'm steppin' out.  
  
Did you hear what he said?  
He said they  
Sold me down the river  
They thought I was a fool  
They said the rain would fall  
What did they know?  
  
Then I saw your face  
And the song that  
You were singin'  
Though I thought I knew the words  
The tune was quite absurd  
And out of key  
Doo dah dah dee.  
  
I'm steppin' out  
I'm moving on  
I'm gonna see the world  
Like a rolling stone  
I'm gonna be somebody...  
Oh, I'm steppin' out.  

You're sailing softly through the sun  
In a broken stone-age dawn.  
You fly so high.  
  
I get a strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic,  
Got a strange magic.  
  
You're walking meadows in my mind,  
Making waves across my tide,  
Oh no, oh no.  
  
I get a strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic,  
Got a strange magic.  
  
Oh, I'm never gonna be the same again,  
Now I've seen the way it's got to end,  
Sweet dream, sweet dream.  
  
Strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic,  
Got a strange magic.  
  
It's magic, it's magic, it's magic.  
Strange magic,  
Oh, what a strange magic,  
Oh, it's a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic.  
Got a strange magic  
You know I got a strange magic

On a cold and windy morning  
Said goodbye to my old friends  
They were hangin' around the corner  
They were stayin' till the end  
  
On the other side of midnight,  
I was lookin' for a place to stay  
And one thing's sure for certain  
I ain't never goin' back again  
  
The streetlights looked so pretty  
As they spread into a town  
I was lookin' for another sundown  
And my head was spinning round and round  
  
Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger  
Lookin' through the eyes of danger  
Lookin' at the all-night dancer  
Never takin' all the chances  
  
As I walked into the main street  
Saw a crowd across the square  
And I heard a guitar playin'  
And I saw you standing there  
  
Lookin' through the eyes of a stranger  
Lookin' through the eyes of danger  
Lookin' at the all-night dancer  
Never takin' all the chances  
  
Distant bells they started ringing  
Somewhere far off in the night  
And the place was full of loneliness  
That disappeared from sight  

When all the thrills have been forgotten  
The chill of night can call them home  
And all the dreams that you left stranded  
Will slowly start to come along  
  
I felt it as she slipped away, slipped away  
I didn't have the words to say  
When I saw the stranger  
A stranger on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street  
  
You can go straight as an arrow  
You can go straight as you dare  
Walkin' the old straight and narrow  
Don't always get you there  
  
The sun was shining when I saw it all  
She was moving to a different beat  
When I met a stranger  
A stranger on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street  
  
It came to me out of the blue, out of the blue  
There came the moment that I really knew  
When I met a stranger  
A stranger on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street  
  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street, on a quiet street  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...  
Stranger on a quiet street...

I have waited  
For your love  
For so long  
How do i go on?  
I have told you  
So many times  
It's no good  
You're treating me so wrong.  
  
Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you...  
Here it comes again  
It's all around me  
It must be magic  
Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
I can see you  
In my mind  
The lost time  
That you're saving  
I could reach out  
And touch you  
What can i do?  
The sun ain't shining.  
  
Out there so far away  
Above the sky will say  
For you...

Baby, can you hear me call?  
Is it alright, now your back?s against the wall?  
Baby, is it still the same?  
Do you wonder? Is it on and back again?  
  
[Chorus]  
Surrender, baby, surrender  
Surrender, baby, surrender  
  
I know it, what we said that day  
Are you under? Did it matter anyway?  
You told me, what you said is true  
Does it all mean waiting back alone and blue?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Baby, can you hear me call?  
Is it alright, now your back?s against the wall?  
Baby, is it still the same?  
Do you wonder? Is it on and back again?  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Surrender

Tears in your life  
Nothing but tears in your life  
They come to you in the night  
Tears in your life  
  
Softly they call  
Gathering slowly they fall  
You see those tears and they're all  
Tears in your life  
  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
  
Tears in your life  
Nothing but tears in your life  
Heartbroken fool's paradise  
Tears in your life  
  
Softly they call  
Gathering slowly they fall  
You see those tears and they're all  
Tears in your life  
  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life  
Tears in your life

"Hello, how are you?  
Have you been alright through all those lonely,  
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely nights?"  
That's what I'd say, I'd tell you everything  
If you pick up that telephone, yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
Hey, How you feelin'?  
Are you still the same, don't you realize the things we did,  
We did were all for real, not a dream.  
I just can't believe they've all faded out of view, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah,
oo.  
  
Doo da wop, doo bee doo da wop, do wah doo lang.  
Blue days, black nights, doo wah doo lang.  
I look into the sky, the love you need ain't gonna see you through,  
And I wonder why, the little things you planned ain't comin' true.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.  
  
O. K. so no one's answering,  
Well, can't you just let it ring a little longer,  
Longer, longer oh, I'll just sit tight,  
Through shadows of the night let it ring forever more, oh, hoh hoh hoh.  
  
Doo da wop, doo bee doo da wop, do wah doo lang.  
Blue days, black nights, doo wah doo lang.  
I look into the sky, the love you need ain't gonna see you through,  
And I wonder why, the little things you planned ain't comin' true.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.  
Oh, oh, telephone line, give me some time, I'm living in twilight.

I see the early glow, I hear you say hello  
I watch the shadows fall, I don't see you at all  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
  
I see the autumn rain, falling on my window pane  
I hear you say goodbye, I see a tear in your eye  
  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
Our love couldn't go wrong,  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone,  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
I see you slip away, into another day  
There's no-one else around,  
I watch the sun go down  
  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
Our love couldn't go wrong,  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone,  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
I take the fall  
I see you in a dream, you turn and start to go  
I call to you once more, guess that I'm takin' the fall  
  
It's a lie (I don't believe it's so), it's a lie  
Our love couldn't go wrong,  
How could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone,  
I will go on really believing  
I take the fall  
  
Our love couldn't go wrong, how could I know I was only dreaming  
And now, now that you're gone, I will go on really believing  
I take the fall

There's a girl next door to me who's round the bend  
But she wonders why she can't make any friends  
From her garden she could see me  
In her silver-clad bikini  
Singing, dancing round her fruit tree  
  
Here we go round the lemon tree  
Mister, can't you hear me  
Here we go round the lemon tree  
Mister, don't come near me  
  
Could I calm her down by throwing stones at her  
If only I could make the right approach to her  
Think I'd rather tame a tiger  
Turn those lemons into cider  
Still I'd like to get beside her  
  
Chorus  
  
Three o'clock in the morning  
I could her her toneless singing  
I could smell her lemon perfume in the air  
I walked up to the window  
In the hope that I might see her  
Could the deadly shade of night still bring her there  
  
Chorus  
  
Morning came and into action went my plans  
Went to meet her dressed in bright green underpants  
I crept in and sang discreetly  
Seemed to change your mind discreetly  
Danced together singing sweetly  
  
Chorus  
  
Chorus

One day,I gotta get out of here,  
I gotta make everything clear  
I gotta see you.  
I know,the way that I feel is wrong,so wrong.  
But I gotta carry on, when you ain't around.  
  
I believe things are going wrong,  
And the night goes on and on,  
All your dreams have flown away,  
And the sun won't shine today  
  
[Chorus]  
The lights go down,  
The lights go down,  
The lights go down, and there's no one around.  
  
I know,you're waiting so close to me,  
But how will you ever see, as time rolls away,  
Lonely, but tryin' to be so proud,  
And just as I turn around, the lights go down.  
  
I believe things are going wrong,  
And the night goes on and on,  
All your dreams have flown away,  
And the sun won't shine today  
  
[Chorus]

Well, I came a long way to be here today  
And I left you so long on this avenue  
And here I stand in the strangest land  
Not knowing what to say or do  
As I gaze around at these strangers in town  
I guess the only stranger is me  
And I wonder, yes I wonder  
Is this the way life's meant to be  
  
Although it's only a day since I was taken away  
And left standing here looking in wonder  
The ground at my feet, maybe it's just the old street  
But everything that I know lies under  
And when I see what they've done to this place that  
was home  
Shame is all that I feel  
And I wonder, yes I wonder, is this  
The way life's meant to be  
  
Too late, too late to cry  
The people say  
Too late for you, too late for me  
You've come so far, now you know everything  
My friend  
Just look and see the wonders of our world  
  
As I wander around this wreck of a town  
Where people never speak aloud  
With its ivory towers and its plastic flowers  
I wish I was back in 1981  
Just to see your face instead of this place  
Now I know what you mean to me  
And I wonder, yes, I wonder, is this  
The way life's meant to be.  

Maybe the years have told you  
Do you remember when life was just a new day?  
You know the story don't you?  
The one they told you when life was slipping away  
  
Aah! Look at the brand new day  
Sitting here upon the milky way  
Aah! Look at the dancing girls  
Sitting holding hands across the world  
  
You got a brand new lady  
Just like the one you left down in some other place  
Reading all the letters  
Saw your face coming through on the ouija board  
  
Aah! Look at the brand new day  
Sitting here upon the milky way  
Aah! Look at the dancing girls  
Sitting holding hands across the world  
  
You heard the words of aaron  
He spoke the truth in these things both great and small  
  
You can throw away the ashes  
You sweep them over the world on your own accord  
Did you know the real answer?  
Youd see the kind of mistakes that you can't afford

Remember the good old 1980's,  
When things were so uncomplicated,  
I wish I could go back there again  
And everything could be the same.  
  
I've got a ticket to the moon  
I'll be leaving here any day soon  
Yeah, I've got a ticket to the moon  
But I'd rather see the sunrise, in your eyes.  
  
Got a ticket to the moon  
I'll be rising high above the earth so soon  
And the tears I cry might turn into the rain  
That gently falls upon your window  
You'll never know.  
  
Ticket to the moon  
Fly, fly through a troubled sky  
Up to a new world shining bright.  
  
Flying high above,  
Soaring madly through the mysteries that come,  
Wondering sadly if the ways that led me here,  
Could turn around and I would see you there,  
Standing there  
  
Ticket to the moon  
Flight leaves here today from Satellite 2  
As the minutes go by, what shall I do,  
I paid the fare, what more can I say,  
It's just one way.  
  
Ticket to the moon.  

They say some days you're gonna win  
They say some days you're gonna lose  
I tell you I got news for you  
You're losin' all the time, you never win, no  
  
If you believe that's how it's gonna be I'd better put you down  
Get off your tightrope up there, come down on  
The ground you gotta save me now, you better turn around  
  
When I looked around, I was heading down  
Won't somebody throw me down a line?  
  
They say some days you gotta give  
They say some days you gotta take  
If that's the way it's gotta be  
Roll it over and you will see  
  
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time  
The change from night to day is really only hours  
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign?  
  
When I looked around, I was heading down  
Won't somebody throw me down a line?  
  
I want to look you straight in the eye  
I want to tell you how I really feel  
And I can feel the wheels are turnin' round  
Won't somebody throw me down a line?  
  
The city streets are full of people going nowhere making time  
The change from night to day is really only hours  
It's just along the line, can't you see the sign?  
  
When I closed my eyes, I was so surprised  
Somebody had thrown me down the line, stopped me drownin'  
Somebody had thrown me down the line

Time after time, time after time  
The skies are darkening they grow so dim  
Strangers are meeting but it never ends  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Time after time)  
From far away there comes a warning sound  
And no one listens but it's all around  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
[Chorus:]  
Time after time, no hiding anywhere  
Time after time, the visions in the air  
Time after time, they come from everywhere  
  
(Time after time)  
Time after time  
Just listen to the sirens of the world  
They breathe a whisper waiting for the word  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Time after time)  
Time after time it is the same old story  
Another footstep on the trail of glory  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Chorus)  
  
The beauty of the earth from way up high  
Shines like a jewel upon the velvet sky  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
The skies are darkening they grow so dim  
Strangers are meeting but it never ends  
And one day they'll remember, one day they will know  
  
(Chorus)  
  
Emit retfa emit, no hiding anywhere  
Emit retfa emit, no visions in the air  
They come from everywhere

I saw her there from across the street, she was dressed in black  
And when she moved she moved to a beat, like a Cadillac  
She rode a train, train train train, a train of gold  
She was a woman of suspicious ways, never saw daylight  
And in her room she sat and passed the days  
And she'd creep out at night  
She rode a train, train train train, a train of gold  
  
Train of gold, train of gold  
It took me so long to find out I was wrong  
Now I wait for her in the night  
  
Looked through a window saw a velvet sky, a shade of green  
A violin was playing soft and sweet, like it was a dream  
She rode a train, train train train, a train of gold  
Train of gold, train of gold  
It took me so long to find out I was wrong  
Now I wait for her in the night  
Train of gold, train of gold  
I don't believe her, it just couldn't be her  
I can't get it out of my mind

The city streets are empty now  
(The lights don't shine no more)  
And so the songs are way down low  
(Turning, turning, turning)  
A sound that flows into my mind  
(The echoes of the daylight)  
Of everything that is alive  
(In my blue world)  
  
I turn to stone  
When you are gone  
I turn to stone  
Turn to stone  
When you comin' home  
I can't go on  
  
The dying embers of the night  
(A fire that slowly fades till dawn)  
Still glow upon the wall so bright  
(Turning, turning, turning)  
The tired streets that hide away  
(From here to everywhere they go)  
Roll past my door into the day  
(In my blue world)  
  
I turn to stone  
When you are gone  
I turn to stone  
Turn to stone  
When you comin' home  
I can't go on  
Turn to stone  
When you are gone  
I turn to stone  
  
Yes, I'm turnin' to stone  
'Cause you ain't comin' home  
Why you ain't comin' home  
If I'm turnin' to stone?  
You've been gone for so long  
And I can't carry on  
Yes, I'm turnin', I'm turnin'  
I'm turnin' to stone  
  
The dancing shadows on the wall  
(The two step in the hall)  
Are all I see since you've been gone  
(Turning, turning, turning)  
Through all I sit here and I wait  
(I turn to stone, I turn to stone)  
You will return again someday  
(To my blue world)  
  
I turn to stone  
When you are gone  
I turn to stone  
Turn to stone  
When you comin' home  
I can't go on  
Turn to stone  
When you are gone  
I turn to stone  
  
I turn to stone  
When you are gone  
I turn to stone  
Turn to stone  
When you comin' home  
I can't go on  
Turn to stone  
When you are gone  
I turn to stone

The visions dancing in my mind  
The early dawn, the shades of time  
Twilight crawling through my windowpane  
  
Am I awake or do I dream,  
The strangest pictures I have seen  
Night is day and twilight's gone away  
  
With your head held high and your scarlet lies  
You came down to me from the open skies  
It's either real or it's a dream  
There's nothing that is in between  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
Across the night I saw your face  
You disappeared without a trace  
You brought me here, but can you take me back  
  
Inside the image of your light  
That now is day and once was night  
You lead me here and then you go away.  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
You brought me here, but can you take me back again?  
  
With your head held high and your scarlet lies  
You came down to me from the open skies  
It's either real or it's a dream  
There's nothing that is in between  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I gave you time to steal my mind  
Away from me.  
  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, I only meant to stay awhile  
Twilight, Twilight, Twilight, Twilight.  

Video, eo, eo, eo, eo, eo, eo  
The satellites that search the night they twinkle like a star  
They send their love from up above down to my vtr  
The world is at my fingers under control  
  
Ahhhumm, video, eo, eo, uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video, eh oh, got the world on my tv  
  
I see that rock and roll and all those old time movies  
They beam across the sky together in electric dreams  
I just sit here on my end I'll have it all  
  
Ahhhumm, video, eo, eo, uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video, eh oh, got the world on video  
  
I see the shadows in the twilight as they dance, la, la, la  
Video madness comes upon me like a trance in the dark  
So I just stay right here and the world is okay, okay, okay  
  
Ahhhumm, video, eo, eo, uh ho  
Play it one more time  
Video, eh oh, got the world on video, oh, oh, oh oh oh  
  
And look at me now, I'm burning up the steely wires  
Look at me now, I'm burning up the steely wires  
Look at me now, now, now, now, now...........  
  
Video

So now it's getting late, for those who hesitate, got no one,  
But they don't understand and no one hears the sound,  
It's like a waterfall, it's an illusion.  
  
[Chorus]  
Love is all, waterfall, love is what you are,  
Pulls you in, takes you down, it's a sad affair,  
But you know as you hold back the power there without the friends  
And lovers you could never go on living.  
  
Across the waterfall that's falling evermore down on you,  
Cascading through the days, and flowing on it's way,  
That's how it has to be, just an illusion.  
  
[Chorus]

What is that strang air in the sky.  
Why should a strange star pass me by.  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind,  
The silly people just like you and better too.  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land.  
  
That's all a way that I cut from the lives.  
The day has come at last.  
  
People that cry in the boulevard,  
Their eyes are blind they cry so hard.  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind,  
The silly people just like you and better too.  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning on the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land.  
  
That's all it seems, there is only one dream.  
The day has come at last.  
  
That's all it seems, there is only one dream.  
The day has come at last.  
  
What you have done makes me ashamed.  
Ill blow it up and start again.  
  
How can you congratulate the people who destroyed the piece of mind,  
The silly people just like you and better too.  
How can you keep turning when the overture is burning in the faces  
Of the people in the churches of the land.  
  
That's all it seems, there is only one dream.  
The day has come at last.

Far beyond the things you see  
Time rolls on eternally  
Got a thing about it  
Just can't live without it  
  
Sitting there inside your mind  
Just waiting for the clock to chime  
On a lonely line  
Stood a lonely man  
  
No pictures on an empty wall  
No body there no one at all  
Just echoes in the ivory halls  
When time stood still  
  
Days line up outside the door  
Thought time had stopped there was no more  
Been a lonely world  
Such a lonely world  
  
No pictures on an empty wall  
No Toulouse, Vincent, or Pablo  
Just echoes in the ivory halls  
When time stood still  
  
No big machine or April showers  
No submarines no plastic flowers  
Just echoes in the ivory towers  
When time stood still  
  
When time stood still  
  
When time stood still  
  
When time stood still

Whisper in the night  
Over silent evening air  
Angel's gown shines white  
All at once you're glad she's there  
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me  
For I'll be here till light  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
  
Night turns into gold  
So the tide may turn today  
Though God gave the world  
It's not mine to throw away  
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me  
For I'll be here till light  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
La da da - da  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
  
Help to face what the day may bring  
Angels sing  
You were sent to make the night be kind  
What will I find  
  
Snowflake bird she came  
Taking grey clouds from your door  
Face the midnight sun  
You have something to live for  
Daughter of your dream shine a guiding light for me  
For I'll be here till light  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me  
La da da - da  
Whisper in the night  
Till she has forgiven me

She sparkle like my jean  
She more than seventeen  
Seems keen in other words  
She must have been  
A former beauty queen  
Now she's a naughty girl  
Chorus  
Wild wild wild tiger woman  
(wild wild wild wild)  
You move me very fast  
But can you last another day  
Get out of the way  
Wild wild tiger woman  
(wild wild wild wild)  
You gonna break you're little fall  
They call her the wild tiger woman  
Tied to the bed  
Tied to the bed  
She's waitin to be fed  
No pay to sir aday (? )  
Can't see an ounce of reason in her head  
Don't laugh and turn away  
Chorus  
Need another girl to come and grab her by the tail  
As I was hoping that the ground would open up and take me in  
Life is so obscene and the remarks that go unseen  
Are being diminished to the earth  
Ill never find another girl  
All in the race  
Such a friendly face  
Seems clean and upper-class  
Young indecisive  
Minds are in a maze  
She lose me very fast  
Chorus  

Sometimes I look up high  
And then I think there might,  
Just be a better life  
Away from all we know  
That's where I wanna go  
Out on the wild side,  
And I wish I was  
Oh oh oh oh, a wild west hero.  
  
Ride the range all the day  
Till the first fading light  
Be with my western girl  
Round the fire oh so bright  
I'd be the indians' friend  
Let them live to be free  
Ridin' into the sunset  
I wish I could be.  
  
I'd ride the desert sands  
And through the prairie lands  
Tryin' to do what's right  
The folks would come to me  
They'd say we need you here  
I'd stay there for the night,  
Oh I wish I was  
Oh oh oh oh, a wild west hero  
  
Ride the range all the day  
Till the first fading light  
Be with my western girl  
Round the fire oh so bright  
I'd be the indians' friend  
Let them love to be free  
Ridin' into the sunset  
I wish I could be.

I watch the cars move, I watch the lights up on the window  
I walk along the street, I'm only thinking of you  
I watch the clock staring from the wall, it hardly moves at all  
It's you I'm waiting for  
Without someone I can depend on  
I'm lost without someone  
As I go on, I hope you're remembering  
I'm lost without someone  
All alone no one around, I watch the shadows falling faster  
The city lights begin to glow and then I start to realize  
I count the hours as they slip away into another day  
Wondering where you'll stay  
Without someone I can depend on  
I'm lost without someone  
As I go on, I hope you're remembering  
I'm lost without someone  
Still watching the cars move, still watching the lights  
Upon the window  
I'm walking down the street, I'm only thinking of you  
I hear the night as it calls to me, it plays a symphony  
It says you're gone from me  
Without someone I can depend on  
I'm lost without someone  
As I go on, I hope you're remembering  
I'm lost without someone

I saw an ant devour sherman mountain.  
Slip across the floor in the river of honey.  
I saw the locust drinking from a fountain.  
It smiled at me as I paid my money.  
Chorus  
Caus' I'm a witness, witness, see the writing on the wall.  
I'm a witness, witness, I say I've seen it all.  
Caus' I'm a witness, witness, I've got all the proof.  
I'm a witness, witness, I swear to tell the truth.  
I saw her buying in the face of fashion.  
Who'll believe with her little white lies.  
I saw her arrive on my bed of passion.  
But I never saw a look of love in her eyes.  
Chorus  
Some days my eyes can see for miles and miles around.  
Some nights my dreams just take me deep underground.  
My minds a time machine, I'm in the future and the past.  
The past... scrape away...  
(violin solo)  
Chorus  
Chorus  
Witness, witness, witness  
Witness, witness, witness  
Witness, witness, witness  
Witness, witness, witness  

A place where nobody dared to go  
The love that we came to know  
They call it Xanadu  
And now, open your eyes and see what we have made is real  
We are in Xanadu  
  
A million lights are dancing and you are, a shooting star  
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, your neon lights will shine for you, Xanadu  
  
The love that echoes of long ago  
You needed the world to know  
They are in Xanadu  
The dream that came through a million years  
That lived through all the tears  
It came to Xanadu  
  
A million light are dancing and you are, a shooting star  
An everlasting world and you're here with me, eternally  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, Xanadu  
(Now we are here) in Xanadu  
Xanadu, your neon lights will shine for you, Xanadu  
  
Now that I'm here, now that you're near, in Xanadu  

I sent a message to another time,  
But as the days unwind, this I just can't believe,  
I send a note across another plane,  
Maybe it's all a game, but this I just can't conceive  
  
I drive the very latest Hover car,  
I don't know where you are  
But I miss you so much till then,  
I met someone who looks a lot like you,  
She does the things you do, but she is an IBM  
  
She's only programmed to be very nice,  
But she's as cold as ice, whenever I get too near,  
She tells me that she likes me very much,  
But when I try to touch, she makes it all too clear.  
  
She is the latest in technology,  
Almost mythology, but she has a heart of stone,  
She has an IQ of 1, 001,  
She has a jump suit on, and she's also a telephone.  
  
Chorus  
  
Is that what you want - is it what you really want.  
  
I realize that it must seem to strange,  
That time has rearranged, but time has the final word  
She knows I think of you, she reads my mind,  
She tries to be unkind, she knows nothing of your world  
  
Although her memory banks overflow  
No one would ever know, all she says, "Is that what you want?"  
Maybe one day I'll feel her cold embrace,  
And kiss her interface, until then I'll leave her alone.  
  
Chorus
