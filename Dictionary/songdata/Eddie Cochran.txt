I had a heartache, I cried a tear  
There was a girl I met, she doesn't care  
Oh bad baby doll what's wrong with you  
Why did you leave this way  
When you tore the love we shared I cried  
When you told me that you love me, oh you lied  
Well I'm findin' out again, into love I shouldn't fall  
Oh why-why-why, oh my baby doll  
  
Sometimes I sit around, I'm feelin' all alone  
I try to call you but you won't pick up that phone  
Ooh bad baby doll look what you do, I can't go on this way  
Why can't we get together to explain  
Just why I've left you standin' in the rain  
Well I'm findin' out again, into love I shouldn't fall  
Oh why-why-why, oh my baby doll

Well the party is through, we said our good-byes  
We had a good time, yet there's tears in my eyes  
Oh, what can it be, what's the matter with me  
You left me half loved  
We stood in the dark and you held my hand  
Why were you afraid, I can't understand  
I wanted your kiss, but it's always like this  
You left me half loved  
Well you hold me close, everytime we danced  
  
Am I a fool, to think that I had a chance  
To hope, you see, I'm your big romance  
Baby that's why I'm in the dark  
Oh-oh-oh-oh, my friends have all said  
To love you is wrong  
They say you're too young, but I'll string along  
Someday you'll wake up and then I'll make up  
For bein' half loved

Let me tell you about a girl I know,  
She's my baby and I love her so.  
Every morning when the sun comes up,  
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup.  
That's why I know, yes I know,  
Hallelujah I just love her so.  
When I call her on the telephone,  
She says baby, I'm all alone.  
By the time I count from one to four,  
She'll be knocking on my door.  
In the evening when the sun goes down  
And there ain't nobody else around,  
She kisses me and she holds me tight.  
She says baby everything is alright.  
That's why I know, that's why I know  
Hallelujah I just love her so.  
Hallelujah I just love her so,  
Hallelujah I just love that chick so.

Hey there baby with the long hair, I know you played it cool  
You play the game of broken hearts, with the heart of a fool  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool  
I never was a scholar, was never good at school  
I learned to love the hard way, with the heart of a fool  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with a heart of a fool  
  
You know you should have warned me, I didn't know the rules  
Now I'm just a lonesome traveller, with a heart of a fool  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool  
Too many times I loved you, too soon you said goodbye  
Too late I learned my lesson, now, too many times I cried  
'Cause I believed you, yes I believed you  
You let me love you with the heart of a fool

Walkin' to the market place in New Orleans  
I saw the cutest little queen  
A pair of eyes I couldn't miss  
Lips that were beggin' to be kissed  
  
I went flyin' out in space  
When I saw that pretty face  
And I found that warm embrace  
At the market place, market place  
  
I didn't even know her name and didn't care  
I was glad I took a walk and saw her there  
In my arms she began to dance  
That was the start of a big romance  
  
Now that we are married up and settled down  
I like to sit and think of ol' New Orleans town  
The Mardigras, the happy fun  
Thankful for that good love I won

Well I woke up this morning, looked out the door  
I could tell that was my milkcow, by the way that she lowed

Ooh, since my cow's been gone  
  
Tried everything baby, to get along with you  
Now I'm gonna tell you what I'm gonna do  
Gonna stop my cryin' , leave you alone  
If you don't think I'm leavin'  
You just count the days I'm gone  
'Cause you' re gonna need me  
Need your lovin' daddy one of these days  
Yeah, and you gonna be oh-so-sorry you treated me this way  

Here's a story about Minnie the Moocher  
She was a low down hoochie-coocher  
She was the roughest, toughest frail  
But Minnie had a heart as big as a whale  
  
[Original Chorus]  
Hodee-hodee-hodee-ho (hodee-hodee-hodee-ho)  
Ra-dee-da-dee-da (ra-dee-da-dee-da)  
Teedle-teedle-dee (teedle-teedle-dee)  
Hodee-hodee-hodee-ho (hodee-hodee-hodee-ho)  
  
Min' had a dream about the King of Sweden  
He gave her things that she was needin'  
Gave her a home built of gold and steel  
A platinum car with diamond starlet wheels  
  
[Variations on Chorus]  
  
Oh Minnie met ol' Deacon Lowdown  
He preached to her, oh you oughta slow down  
But Minnie wiggled and did the stroll  
The Deacon Lowdown hollered, oh save my soul  
  
[Variations on Chorus]  
  
They took her where they put the crazies  
Now poor ol' Minnie is a-kickin' up daisies  
You heard my story, this ends my song  
She was just a good gal, but they done her wrong  
  
[Variations on Chorus]

At the barndance hi-de-ho  
Folks gettin' near him, they all wanna hear him  
He's mister Fiddle with the bow  
  
Now me and uncle Andy, we think he's a dandy  
We like to see him dangle the bow  
If you haven't seen or heard it  
You can believe every word of it  
He's mister fiddle with the bow

If you dig, you move on quick like, start to dig my dream  
Come here pretty baby, quick like, quick like  
Gotta hold you near me, quick like, quick like  
Hop-hop, hurry up, quick like, quick like

Oh, dancin' all night, so I have my play  
But how can I work when I sleep all day  
I got those rock 'n' roll blues, those rock 'n' roll blues  
I dig way down deep in my ol' blue jeans  
To put my last dime in that record machine  
I got those rock 'n' roll blues, those rock 'n' roll blues  
I have the blues to fight  
And to make things worse I fell in love last night  
The little girl I found  
Said to stop my hoppin' and settle down  
Oh why can't there be two of poor o1' me  
One on the dancefloor and one hangin' 'round the door  
I got those rock 'n' roll blues, those rock 'n' roll blues

Rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
But she said, daddy, don't leave me here to whine  
You're breakin' my heart right half in two  
By rollin' on down the line  
But I kept on rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
Now she said, baby, won't you please change your mind  
There's nothin' you could say or do  
That would ever make me change my mind  
And I kept on rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The sweetest little gal that I ever did know  
I had to leave her behind  
  
And she said, honey, don't leave me here alone  
'Cause if you do and you get back, you won't find me at home  
And I kept on rollin', rollin' on down the line  
The worst mistake that I ever made  
Was leavin' that gal behind  
And I kept on rollin'... And I kept on rollin'

Rough stuff...  
Your cheatin' lips taste sweet when they are pressed to mine  
Rough stuff  
I wish that I could break a leg but you're too fine  
You said you love me, but it's plain to see, you're not mine  
Rough stuff...  
You got me in your spell, I'm just the same to you  
Rough stuff...  
Why can't you settle down and give a love that's true  
I have lost my strut and I cry inside, I'm so blue  
Woo-woo-woo, I tried to tame you but it can't be done  
Woo-woo-woo-woo, I oughta hate you but I love you  
You're the only one, oh rough stuff  
You know I couldn't live if we should ever part  
Rough stuff  
I'm such a fool and you been foolin' from the start  
Still I hope and pray you will give your heart someday

Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah, Sarah Lee  
Won't you come along and go with me  
To a place where the lights are bright  
Where they do nothing but rock all night  
Rock all night, rock all night

See them laugh  
Watch them stare (watch them stare)  
They always do when I'm with you  
See, they say our love will never hold  
That you're too young and I'm too old  
And just the same. I don't feel blue  
'Cause I have you (I-I-I have you)  
See them laugh  
Why won't they (why won't they)  
Give us a chance for our romance  
See, although our age is not the same  
I love you so, I can't explain  
'Cause it don't matter what they say or do  
(I-I-I do) See

Serious, serious, seriously in love  
Serious, serious, seriously in love  
You-mmm-you-you my-my lovely one  
Mmm-mm, my only one, as bright as a star  
With eyes as true as the ocean blue  
That's why I'm serious, well, over you  
  
Oh please, please hold me tight  
Don't let me go, not tonight  
I see the tears, the cryin'  
And I see the lips that try not to say goodbye  
And that's why I'm so serious  
I'm serious over you  
  
You-ooh-you-you my lovely one  
You're my only one, as bright as a star  
With eyes true as the ocean blue  
That's why I'm serious, wohw, over you

I'm just a-sittin' in the balcony  
Just a-watchin' the movie  
Or maybe it's a symphony, I wouldn't know  
I don't care about the symphonies  
Just a-cymballs and a-timpanies  
  
I'm just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row  
I'll hold your hand and I'll kiss you too  
The feature's over, but we're not through  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony  
  
Holdin' hands in the balcony  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row  
  
We may stop lovin' to watch Bugs Bunny  
But he can't take the place of my honey  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony  
Just a-snootchin' in the balcony  
  
Just a-sittin' in the balcony, on the very last row  
Just a-huggin' and a-kissin'  
With my baby in the very last row

Some people say a man is made outta mud  
A poor man's made outta muscle and blood  
Muscle and blood and skin and bones  
A mind that's weak and a back that's strong  
  
[Chorus]  
You load sixteen tons, what do you get?  
Another day older and deeper in debt  
Saint Peter don't you call me 'cause I can't go  
I owe my soul to the company store  
  
I was born one mornin' when the sun didn't shine  
I picked up my shovel and I walked to the mine  
I loaded sixteen tons of number nine coal  
And the straw boss said "Well, bless my soul"  
  
I was born one mornin', it was drizzlin' rain  
Fightin' and trouble are my middle name  
I was raised in the canebrake by an ol' mama lion  
And no high-toned woman make me walk the line  
  
If you see me comin', better step aside  
A lotta men didn't and a lotta men died  
One fist of iron, the other of steel  
If the right one don't get you then the left one will

Well I got a girl they call Skinnie Minnie  
She may be skinny but she's got plenty  
The kind of lovin' that I desire  
The kind of love that sets my soul on fire  
Skinnie Minnie, man that gal can love  
She's long and lean like a stringbean  
She don't look good in blue jeans  
Her hair hangs down like a rag mop  
She makes my heart go flippedy-flop  
She can't cook, she ain't much on looks  
The things she knows, she didn't read in books  
Skinnie Minnie, man that gal can love  
  
When me and Minnie walk down the street  
All the boys stop and stare  
But if they knew just what I do  
You bet your life they'd love her too  
Well, when I kiss her out in the dark  
I tear the thing up, there's so much spark  
Skinnie Minnie, man that gal can love

Well you're a fast movin' woman, I'm a slow movin' guy  
Yeah I like to crawl baby, you like to fly  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
I gotta admit that you got a lotta class  
I said you better watch out which Cadillac you pass  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
'Cause one of these nights, when you speed around town  
You gonna pass me baby and I'll turn my damper down  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
(Let's rock it!)  
  
You got a full house motor and it runs real good  
Yeah, fine upholstery and a packed-out hood  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
You're the motorvatest gal that I've ever seen  
Baby you better slow down or I'm gonna flee the scene  
You better slow down baby, you better slow down  
Slow down baby you' re way ahead of me

Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely I'm losin' you  
Soon you'll be leavin', soon I'll be grievin'  
Slowly but surely I'm losin' you  
I can see it in your eyes, I can feel it in your kiss  
But I didn't realise it would all end like this  
Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely. I'm losin' you  
  
Somebody's takin' my place, I can plainly see  
It's written on your face, you're not satisfied with me  
Slowly but surely, though I love you dearly  
Slowly but surely, I'm losin' you

I've got a bone to pick with this world  
But I'm not very handsome, I can't find a girl  
I asked the aid of the whole universe  
I'm not very happy, it could be worse  
  
[Chorus:]  
Somebody help me (yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Somebody help me (yeah-yeah-yeah)  
Somebody please, somebody please help me  
  
I've been searchin' all over town  
Tryin' to find a girl who'd dare to vow  
The birds and the bees are helping me around  
We're turning this whole town upside down  
  
I've been watching the clock on the wall  
I've been waiting for my baby to call  
I've been pacin' all the floor  
Waiting for my baby to knock on the door

A look a-there, here she comes  
There comes that girl again  
Wanted to date her since I don't know when  
But she don't notice me when I pass  
She goes with all the guys from outa my class  
But that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself  
She's sure fine-lookin' man, she's something else  
  
Hey, look a-there, across the street  
There's a car made just for me  
To own that car would be a luxury  
But my dollar can't afford the gas  
A brand new convertible is outa my class  
But that can't stop me from a-thinkin' to myself  
That car's fine-lookin' man, it's something else  
  
Hey, look a-here, just wait and see  
Worked hard and saved my dough  
I'll buy that car that I been wanting so  
Get me that girl and we'll go ridin' around  
We'll look real sharp with the flight top down  
I keep right on a-dreamin' and a-thinkin' to myself  
When it all comes true man, wow, that's something else  
  
Look a-there, what's all this  
Never thought I'd do this before  
But here I am a-knockin' on her door  
My car's out front and it's all mine  
Just a forty-one Ford, not a fifty-nine  
I got that girl an' I'm a-thinkin' to myself  
She's sure fine-lookin' man, wow, she's something else

Well, baby our love was born the moment that we met  
But early in the morning, the grass is always wet  
So, just like the dewdrops, our love would fade away  
But how was I to know it couldn't last a day  
  
But now there's no use crying  
There's no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying, there's no use crying over spilled milk  
  
I know just what went wrong, the cards I didn't play  
If my game was strong, she'd still be mine today  
But losing ain't my name, although I not the same  
I ain't gonna be no fool, put myuself to shame  
  
'Cause there's no use crying  
There's no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying, there's no use crying over spilled milk  
  
We're all washed up it's true, the rain came all to soon  
But I'll find someone new, this won't be my ruin  
And if I play it smart, on a brand new start  
I know just how to hold on, to my new found heart  
  
And then there's no use crying  
There's no use crying over spilled milk  
No use crying, there's no use crying over spilled milk  
Spilled milk, yeah, spilled milk

Oh, my baby goes rockin', ooh, rockin' all night  
No shoes no stockin's, but that's all right  
Well she don't need stockin's and shoes to rock all night  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Well I love a-my baby, indeed I do  
Well I love a-my baby, she loves me too  
You oughta see us rock without stockin's and shoes  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Well the bare feet slappin' on the hardwood floor  
These crazy things a-happen, along about four  
And the very next night my baby's a-back for more  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Well I bought my baby some crazy socks  
I love my baby, but she don't wear socks  
Yeah she kicks her shoes right off and man she rocks  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Well you don't need stockin's and shoes to dance the blues  
Ooh, stockin's and shoes, stockin's and shoes  
Stockin's and shoes

Think of me and miss me, as I'll be missing you  
Promise to be true and I'll be true to you  
Dream of me and talk to me, though we're far apart  
I will hear you dear, hear you in my heart  
When you're all alone and you're feelin' blue  
Remember that I'm here and I'll be lonely too  
And the sun will shine and our love will grow  
Oh, time cannot erase a love like ours, I know  
So, think of me and miss me, as I'll be missing you  
Promise to be true and I'll be true to you

Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Hopin' that you love me too

When I looked at my ticket, I bought seats for two  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you

Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you

'Cause I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you  
Wonderin' if you miss me too  
Well I been thinkin' about you, wonderin' about you

Look up in the sky, up towards the north  
There are three new stars, brightly shining forth  
They're shining oh-so bright from heaven above  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love  
  
Ritchie, you were just starting to realise your dreams  
Everyone calls me a kid, but you were only seventeen  
Now Almighty God has called you, from oh-so far away  
Maybe it's to save some boy or girl  
Who might have gone astray  
And with your star shining through the dark and lonely night  
To light the path and show the way, the way that's right  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love  
  
Buddy, I can still see you, with that shy grin on your face  
Seems like your hair was always a little messed up  
And kinda outa place  
Now, not many people actually knew you or  
Understood how you felt  
But just a song, just a song from you  
Could make the coldest heart melt  
Well you're singing for God now, in his chorus in the sky  
Buddy Holly, I'll always remember you with tears in my eyes  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love  
  
I see a stout man, the Big Bopper's your name  
God called you to heaven, maybe for new fortune and fame  
Keep wearing that big Stetson hat and ramble up to the mike  
And don't forget those wonderful words, you know what I like  
  
Look up in the sky, up towards the north  
There are three new stars, brightly shining forth  
They' re shining oh-so bright from heaven above  
Gee, we're gonna miss you, everybody sends their love

Now there are three steps to heaven  
Just listen and you will plainly see  
And as life travels on and things do go wrong  
Just follow steps one, two and three  
Step one, you find a girl you love  
Step two, she falls in love with you  
Step three, you kiss and hold her tightly  
Yeah that sure seems like heaven to me  
The formula for heaven's very simply  
Just follow the rules and you will see  
And as life travels on and things do go wrong  
Just follow steps one, two and three

The day outside is warm, the sun is shinin' bright  
But since you're gone, the time is wrong  
It's a twenty-four hour night  
My heart is filled with bloom, my soul has lost it's light  
I sit here in my lonely room, it's a twenty-four hour night  
My life is an endless torture, cold and bare and black  
You know how much I want you  
Please, please, please come back  
Come back and take my heart, come make this darkness bright  
Come back again and please, please end  
These twenty-four hour nights, twenty-four hour nights

There's two blue singin' stars in heaven  
I see and hear them every night  
They used to sing and shine here on earth  
So beautiful and bright  
One is a true blue yodeler, he yodeled his way to fame  
The other blue star is from Alabama  
Oh I need not call his name  
They seem to be so happy in their heavenly home  
They're singin' with the angels around God's golden throne  
So when our life on earth is over  
And we turn it to the stars  
We'll meet our friends that sing and play  
Those golden blue guitars  
  
There's two blue singin' stars in heaven  
I see and hear them every night  
Singin' songs coming from their hearts  
To fill mine with delight  
One is a true blue yodeler, he yodeled his way to fame  
The other blue star is from Alabama  
I need not call his name  
They seem to be so happy in their heavenly home  
They're singin' with the angels around God's golden throne  
Someday there'll be a grand reunion  
It'll be a heavenly affair  
When we pass through those pearly gates  
And meet our friends up ther

Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
With golden hair and lips like wine  
And blue eyes, as blue as the sky  
A dream I once knew knew that can never come true  
And only in dreams is she mine  
Oh Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
My heart is at your command  
Why should my heart so true, love, all be for you  
Why I can't understand  
So heartsick I'll be, 'cause you'll never love me  
You'll never love any one man  
Oh Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
  
Oh, not so long ago, this angel I know  
She got hold in my arms so tight  
I knew she were true, but just like a fool  
I lin-gered, now I cry each night  
For Diane, Diane, unfaithful Diane  
Oh, my heart is at your command  
Why should my heart so true, love, all be for you  
Why I can't understand  
So heartsick I'll be, 'cause you'll never love me  
But I still love you, Diane

Old dancin' dick with his walkin' stick  
Should have seen him when he got off the train  
He had all the people standin' in the rain  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
Watchin' the walkin' stick boogie  
He's the fastest man that ever danced into town  
He's got the fastest kick, with his walkin' stick  
You should see the way that he throws it around  
When he dances upside down, doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
He's got the people jumpin' just like the fleas on a hound  
  
You should see the way that the chicks get their kicks  
When ol' dick gets to throw his walkin' stick  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie  
The joint was so hot  
That the boards were flyin' off the floor  
The girls all cried, when he said goodbye  
They knew that the town would be on the bum  
And they couldn't have anymore fun  
Doin' the walkin' stick boogie, the walkin' stick boogie  
It was a very sad day when ol' dick danced out of town

I get up in the morning and what do I find  
You been talkin' all night on a party line  
  
You better watch your mouth (watch your mouth)  
I said watch your mouth (watch your mouth)  
Watch your mouth, well did you? What did you say?  
Watch your mouth  
  
Always tellin' everybody things I do  
Well now you can tel 'em that I'm through with you  
  
You better hear big mama 'cause I want it understood  
A loose-lip-woman just ain't no good  
  
Everytime I see you walkin' down the street  
Your big mouth is movin' just as fast as your feet  
  
Always talkin' about me I know  
If you don't shut your mouth, go on get out that door
