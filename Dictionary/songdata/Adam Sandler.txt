We just wrote this song on the bus the other day so just sit back and relax  
  
I'm the 7 foot man,  
I've committed no crime,  
Bumping my head into doorways,  
It happens all the time,  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
And I repeat,  
They don't make a ski boot that can fit my feet,  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
And I don't play basketball,  
  
I'm 7 feet tall,  
But I'm still just a man,  
So of course it hurts me a lot,  
When I walk into the ceiling fan,  
Small people say I wish I was him,  
But its been nine years since I've had a trim,  
The barber says,  
I can't reach the top of his head,  
  
7 foot man,  
(ha ha)I cannot hide,  
7 foot man,  
I know cause I've tried,  
7 foot man,  
My last girlfriend died,  
Because my penis,  
Is 7 foot wide!!!!!!!!!  
  
So the next time you see me,  
Walking around,  
And my head is right about to hit a tree branch,  
Tell me to duck down,  
And I'll pay you back ,  
Soon you will see,  
By getting you frisbee down from that tree,  
I do what i can,  
I'm the 7 foot man,  
  
7 foot man,  
7 foot man

[Speaking through a microphone]  
"Good morning students and faculty, If I could have your attention please. As
you may, or may not know, Principal Cambell  
will not be here for the rest of the week due to a throat infection. Leaving
me, assistant principal Dunbar, as the school's lone  
administrator for the next few days."  
  
"Though the policies set forth by Principal Cambell will remain the same,
there will be some additional regulations you must also  
follow."  
  
"Number one - smoking outside the administration building will only be allowed
during lunch periods."  
  
"Number two - the girls' showering facilities will be moved from the locker
room into my inner office where I can watch the girls  
wash their breasts and buttocks while I play with myself."  
  
"Number three - while showering, none of the girls will be allowed to snicker
or laugh at the size of my genitalia. Eye contact  
with me is also prohibited."  
  
"Number four - girls are encouraged to wash each other freely as I build
towards orgasm."  
  
"Number five - while i am ejaculating, the boys gymnastic team must undress
each other spread eagle in front of me and satify  
each other orally until I have completed ejaculating."  
  
"Finally, rule number six - any student caught writing graffiti or defacing
school property will be automatically suspended, unless  
they are masturbating."  
  
"If you have any questions about these new regulations, I will be in my office
spanking it with a thumb up my ass."  
  
"Good day"

Whitey:  
Oh they day can't begin  
Till the gard lets me in  
Then I walk for some exersise  
  
In less then a snap  
I complete my daily lap  
Then it's time to socilize  
  
I see Raidy and Ruth  
At the Information Booth  
Have rigged the hearing lady  
At Ben and Jerry's Shake  
  
Then I go to Pet Land  
Where the manager stands  
Has about to be the dangorous stake  
  
Then I pass the tie rack  
On my way to Radioshack  
Where I pretent to be a Hollywood Star  
I try to walk like John Wayne  
While singing in the rain  
And the Janitor laughs all the time!  
  
A little bit later,  
All the flash and the painter  
Was so high I had to close my eyes  
  
Janitor:  
He takes his 11: 30 crap  
  
Whitey:  
Then go over to the Gap  
And try clothes on for kids my size  
  
You want to go to Panda Express?  
Their spicey Chicken is the best!  
Go to Instant Barrel for a medium drink  
Cause their staff is really nice  
And they only use cubed ice  
Which is better then chushed I think  
  
Bangle lesson nothing sees [?]  
Look for chocolate heri-ings [?]  
Cuz he les me take a quich cat nap  
He says he misses his daughter  
Puts my hand in warm water  
And I wake up with a wet yellow lap  
  
Footlocker is my last stop  
Where I have to go and shop  
For some clean passings couples at a nice price  
  
Cuz when I leave the mall,  
I 'reff' Youth League basketball  
And to look your best... Never hurts  
But the greatest thing of all  
If the truth be told  
Here at the mall its never too hot or cold  
Cuz they were smart enough to make it truckin tall  
.. At the mall, at the mall, at the mall!  
Sha-La-La!

[Intro]  
Yo yo, Flyda, check that homegirl's butt out

Why don't you pick up after your done?  
I'm not your slave  
I'm not your mother  
I'm not your maid  
I mean I've got a life too  
So fuck you!  
  
Why can't you be nicer to my friend?  
They're gonna be here soon  
Last time they were here  
You just sat in the bedroom  
Friday you went out with your fat friend Lou  
Fuck you!  
  
Why don't you ever ask about my Chinese cooking class?  
I only took it 'cause you like moo shu  
Fuck you!  
  
I'm sorry honey, about the way I've been acting lately  
Fuck you!  
  
Don't be like that, we'll visit your mom when I get some time off  
Fuck you!  
  
I had the beer at work, for God's sake  
Fuck you!  
  
By the way, would it be cool to go golfing tomorrow?  
Fuck you!  
  
I was just kidding, I want to hang out with you  
Why don't you ever take me to a play?  
Or a museum?  
There's an art gallery two blocks away  
And we've never been there  
We always do what you want to do  
Fuck you!  
  
You didn't notice  
I got new throw pillows for the sofa  
You didn't notice I had the kitched painted blue  
Why don't you notice all those guys looking at me?  
You take me for granted  
Do you know there's a guy at work that always asks me out to lunch?  
I always try to look my best and you should too  
Fuck you!  
  
Why won't I ever get out of this relationship?  
You're such a jerk  
The only thing you do right is  
Tell me that you love me  
Well, I guess I love you too  
But fuck you!  
Seriously

When I'm at the bus stop and you drive by in your mom's car  
You tell me the bus already left  
Cause you're my best friend!  
When I'm at the locker and my shirt's buttoned wrong  
You tell me to fix it  
Cause you're my best friend  
Best friends tell you you got boogers on your nose  
Best friends don't laugh when you wear your grandpa's clothes  
You're my best friend!  
When those guys ripped up my ticket for the Mariah Carey show  
You told me it wasn't that great  
Cause you're my best friend (You're my best friend!)  
When those guys gave me the wrong directions to Mark Hagen's party  
You told me it wasn't that great  
Cause you're my best friend! (You're my best friend!)  
Best friends tell you when you got Cheetos in your teeth  
Best friends don't ring your doorbell then punch you in the chest  
You're my best friend!  
(Best friends!) don't call you Pit Stains or Marphy  
(Best friends!) Way back when you waved hello!  
(Best friends!) Don't hold their nose and point at you  
(Best friends!) Help you find your hat  
Oh, you're not just a friend  
You're my best friend  
(Take it!)  
When those mean girls stole my pants and tied me to the front gate of the
school  
You told the teacher I was out there  
Why? Cause you're my best friend! (You're my best friend!)  
When Mr. Koocher's dog ran at me and bit me in the stomach  
You were playing football so you couldn't help but I know you would've  
Cause you're my best friend (You're my best friend!)  
(Best friends!) Don't kneel behind you while the other guys push you  
(Best friends!) Don't step on your sandwiches!  
(Best friends!) Help you out of the caf. Garbage can  
(Best friends!) Don't tell you that Tracy Garner wants to dance with you  
Oh, you're not just a friend... You're my best friend!  
Oh, you're not just a friend! You're my best... Friend!  
Call me back!

"Okay...  
This is a song that uhh..  
There's a lot of Christmas songs out there and uhh..  
Not too many Chanukah songs.  
So uhh..  
I wrote a song for all those nice little Jewish kids who don't get to  
Hear any Chanukah songs.  
Here we go..."  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
Here comes Chanukah  
So much funukah  
To celebrate Chanukah  
Chanukah is the festival of lights  
Instead of one day of presents, we have eight crazy nights  
  
When you feel like the only kid in town without a Christmas tree  
Here's a list of people who are Jewish just like you and me  
David Lee Roth lights the menorah  
So do James Caan, Kirk Douglas, and the late Dinah Shore-ah  
  
Guess who eats together at the Carnegie Deli  
Bowser from Sha Na Na and Arthur Fonzerelli  
Paul Newman's half Jewish, Goldie Hawn's half too  
Put them together, what a fine lookin' Jew  
  
You don't need "Deck The Halls" or "Jingle Bell Rock"  
'Cause you can spin a dreidel with Captain Kirk and Mr.Spock- both  
Jewish  
  
Put on your yarmulke  
It's time for Chanukah  
The owner of the Seattle Supersonicahs  
Celebrates Chanukah  
  
O.J. Simpson, not a Jew  
But guess who is? Hall of famer Rod Carew- he converted  
We got Ann Landers and her sister Dear Abby  
Harrison Ford's a quarter Jewish- not too shabby  
  
Some people think that Ebenezer  
Scrooge is  
Well he's not, but guess who is  
All three Stooges  
So many Jews are in showbiz  
Tom Cruise isn't, but I heard his agent is  
  
Tell your friend Veronica  
It's time to celebrate Chanukah  
I hope I get a harmonicah  
Oh this lovely, lovely Chanukah  
So drink your gin and tonicah  
And smoke your marijuanikah  
If you really, really wannakah  
Have a happy, happy, happy,  
Happy Chanukah  
  
Happy Chanukah

When I was a boy  
There was no limit on what I could eat  
Shake after shake after shake after shake  
Followed by all kinds of red meat  
Metabolism runnin' around so fast  
My body never gained no weight  
That pissed off all my Momma's friends  
And made my big-boned sister irate  
But now I'm a man  
And all that food frolicking has caused my ego to hurt  
'Cause even when I'm in the shower alone  
I'm too embarrassed to remove my shirt  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
And all them cookies I been munching lately  
My feets are becoming difficult to see  
I believe it was my Daddy  
Who led to this eating disease  
By calling me "The Little Candy-ass"  
When I couldn't finish a burger with cheese  
Or maybe it was my Momma  
Who got me addicted to the wrong foods  
Only when I gobbled down every chicken cutlet  
Would I get to see Momma's good moods  
They said eat this, they said eat that  
To stay skinny there was no chance  
And now when I walk I hear corduroy  
Even though I ain't wearing pants  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
(You fat fuck, you fat fuck)  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
(You fat fuck, you fat fuck)  
And all that ice cream I been eatin' lately  
My chins alone weigh 203  
The diet starts tomorrow!  
I have a grapefruit for breakfast  
For lunch a bowl of white rice  
Dinnertime it's a saltless potato  
I ain't allowed no spice  
If this diet's gonna work  
Tonight I can't eat no more  
"Just go to sleep," I say to myself  
As I close the bedroom door  
Two in the morning, I wake up to piss  
My belly's hungry and achin'  
Tiptoe to the kitchen, fuck the diet  
Bring on the chips flavored with bacon  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Made a fat mother-fucker outta me  
What made a millionaire out of Mr. Frito-Lay  
Make a tub o' shit outta me  
And all them crumb-cakes I been eating lately  
I shoulda bought stock in Sara Lee  

When I was a young man  
I didn't like to dance  
I was shy  
I'd stand against the wall all night  
I'd never take a chance  
So afraid  
I wouldn't get on that dance floor  
Unless I was really drunk  
10 shots  
  
But I found a place where the stars hang out  
And they taught me how to funk  
Real nasty  
It ain't too far away  
It's just on the edge of town  
Nearby  
But be ready when you get there  
'Cause these folks don't fuck around  
  
You can  
Rub your belly with Liza Minelli  
Covered in jelly, you're gonna rub your belly  
Jiggle your droopy balls with singin' Lou Rawis  
Bounce off the walls, then jiggle them droopy balls  
Grind your hips with the blond guy from CHIPS  
Lick your lips  
Stroke it clean with Martin Sheen  
It's fucking obscense  
Clench your ass-cheeks tight with sexy grandma Betty White  
You'll see the light when your sphincter's tight  
  
If you don't know how to move  
Just feel the groove  
And dance  
Like you just shit your pants  
  
Spin like a little girl  
With cross-dressing Milton Berle  
Just give it a whirl, pretend you're a little girl  
Wave that juicy weeno with legendary Al Pacino  
Wave your weeno, even more obsceno  
Knock back a drink with Colonel Klink  
Piss in the sink  
Bounce your beef with Omar Sharif  
What a relief  
Ring the disco bell with ice cream wizard Tommy Carvel  
Tommy Carvel gonna make your dink swell  
  
Then spew all over the room  
With Mr. Jeffry Goldblum  
And dance  
Like you just shit your pants  
  
Mr. Belvedere  
Fatty Fatty  
Finger in his own rear  
Bernard King  
Basketball, basketball  
Showing off his ding-a-ling  
Swimming Mark Spitz  
Moustache, moustache  
Playing with his hairy tits  
  
Big Earl Weaver, Tommy Seaver  
Both of them got the boogie fever  
Shit your pants  
You can  
Do the hustle with seven-footer Billy Russell  
Do the fucking hustle, jerking your love muscle  
Shake your big, round ass with the ghost of Mama Cass  
Blast from the past, the ghost of Mama Cass  
Dry-hump the floor with Mary Tyler-Moore  
Pump it sore  
Squeeze your nipple like baldy Mr. Whipple  
Drink some Ripple  
Give it a hearty whack with TV great Victor Tayback  
When you give it a whack, don't hurt the nut-sack  
  
So if the thought of grooving is bringing you down  
Come to the funkiest place in town  
The stars will show you how to move  
And dance  
Like you just shit your pants

I'm the kinda guy who can't stand the holiday  
So I drink em all away, that's me  
I don't decorate no trees  
And I won't eat no potato laces  
But I'll give this old lady's melons a squeeze  
That's just who I am  
  
Well I'll never spin a dreidle  
But I'll always throw an egg  
And I'll charlie horse your leg for laughs  
While you're singin' your holiday tune  
I'm actin' like a town buffoon  
With an out my big white scary moon  
And blowin' out beef your way  
  
I hate folks who think reindeer are cute  
To me, they're just somethin' to shoot  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me  
  
Well I'm a snowmobile stealin', no tears the season feelin' kind of guy  
This time of year sucks  
So I take my nun-chucks  
And make sure every snowman dies  
  
Believing in Santa's all wrong  
And Hanukkah's eight nights too long  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me  
  
I hate love  
I hate you  
I hate me

He said he'd be here at seven  
The clock just hit 7:22  
It's too cold outside  
To wait for my ride  
Watching mamma try out a new doo (Bruins)  
  
He said he'd be here at seven  
But it just hit 7:35 (already?)  
Here in Brockton, Mass.,  
I got my thumb in my ass  
Mamma's combing up a big beehive (Celtics)  
  
Where the fuck is he?  
Where the fuck is he?  
  
The bitch doesn't even bother calling  
Even though it's 7:44 (I fell asleep, pally)  
I'm feeling kinda antsy  
Mamma's getting fancy  
Slicking back a wet pompadour (Red Sox)  
  
He said he'd be here at seven  
It's closing in on 8:01 (Trimmin' the 'stache, kid)  
Me lookin' like a sap  
In a wool knit cap

Oh, no (Massive hailstorm, massive hailstorm, massive)  
  
That stupid little punk  
He's probably fuckin' drunk  
I bet he drank a case  
Want to pop him in the face right now  
Mamma's eyebrow  
  
Wicked good  
Wicked good (Oh, GOD)  
Wicked good  
Wicked good (Fuck yeah)  
Wicked good  
Wicked good (Pisser?)  
  
Well my friend is still a no-show  
And I'm getting fucking pissed (Why?)  
'Cause I could've gone with Charlie  
In the side of his Harley  
Mamma's on the phone with a stylist (Fuck Charlie!)  
  
So I guess I ain't going out tonight  
'Cause the digits say 12:09 (Shit-faced)  
But call the operator  
'Cause one perm later  
Mamma's hair sure do look fine (Heffenreffer!!!)  
  
Where the fuck is he? (Ah, ha ha! My stepfather was tellin' me a wicked funny
joke!)  
Where the fuck is he? (Ah, ha ha! I forgot it though)  
  
I wish I had a car  
I wish I had a car (A cop pulled me over, buddy)  
  
I wish I went with Charlie (5.2 blood level, state record)  
I could have gone with Charlie (I'm in a wicked mess of trouble, ha ha!)

But you didn't remember me the very next day  
  
Forgetful Lucy  
Has got a nice caboose-ie  
  
I used to trick you into pulling your car over so we could chat  
But my favorite time was when you beat the shit out of Ula with a bat  
Then we drove up to see Dr. Keets  
And find out why Doug always has to change his sheets  
  
Forgetful Lucy  
Cracked her head like Gary Busey  
  
But I still love her so  
And I'll never let her go  
Even if while I'm singing this song  
She's wishing I had Jocko the Walrus' shlong

Her lips are so damn juicy  
How about another first kiss?

Hey  
Why'd you wake me from my nap?  
I'm not in the mood  
To play your games  
Or sit on your lap  
  
You  
Where's my Yankees drinking glass?  
I want some juice  
And I want it now  
So you better move your ass  
And feel bad for me  
'Cause I'm just getting over a cold  
  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
Somebody better tie my shoes!  
  
Now  
I run down the hall  
I scream and I yell  
And I cry 'cause I fell  
Bring the rubbing alcohol  
  
Outside  
I get mud on my shoe  
I come back in the house  
I get it on the rug  
The cleanging's up to you  
And I won't take a bath  
Unless you make me Spaghetti-O's  
  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
Mommy reads to me at night  
Charlie and the Chocolate Factory  
  
Well  
I can't have a job  
And I can't go to school  
If no grownups are around  
I can't go near the pool  
I'm not alowed to climb  
My neighbor's apple tree  
I'm not allowed to sit  
Too close to the TV  
I don't know how to drive  
And I don't know how to spell  
But if I hear my brother cursing  
I do know how to tell  
'cause he made me eat some bread  
That was covered in mold  
  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I'm four years old!  
I just threw up on my grandmother

I wanna make you smile whenever you're sad  
Carry you around when your arthritis is bad  
All I wanna do is grow old with you  
  
I'll get your medicine when your tummy aches  
Build you a fire if the furnace breaks  
Oh it could be so nice, growing old with you  
  
I'll miss you  
Kiss you  
Give you my coat when you are cold  
  
Need you  
Feed you  
Even let ya hold the remote control  
  
So let me do the dishes in our kitchen sink  
Put you to bed if you've had too much to drink  
I could be the man who grows old with you  
  
I wanna grow old with you

I was drivin' around in Old Mexico.  
I got lost didn't know what way to go.  
I was confused, It was late and I was in the fog,  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
  
I felt that smoosh and I said oh Mama.  
My lowrider squished that little Chihuahua.  
I pray for forgiveness and I sin to my god.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
  
If I am caught they will lock me in a cell with 20 locks.  
Unless I can pin it on Jack in The Box.  
I'll be wipped then beaten and then I will be flogged.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
  
His last words were yakey aro el medico.  
I flattened that pup, to hell I will go.  
I should have not gone driving and went for a jog.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.  
I ran over the Taco Bell dog.

[Billy]: Yes, I will go back to school  
And achieve victory!  
No man will take what my father has built  
Unless that man is me!  
  
[Veronica]: My Billy, sweet Billy boy  
I knew you would go back  
No one can stop you if you try  
Don't I have a nice rack?  
  
[Billy]: Veronica, I thank you  
For beating the shit out of me  
I see things so clearly now  
I choose my destiny  
  
[veronica]: Oh Billy, I knew you had it in ya'  
  
[Kids]: We're here to help you Billy  
Get back in school to stay  
You gotta' work real hard  
And stick it out  
Till graduation day!  
  
[Clown]: Hey, Kids! It's me  
I bet you thought that I was dead  
But when I fell over I just broke my leg  
And got a hemorrhage in my head [ha ha ha]  
  
[All]: There are obstacles in the way  
[Maid]: In the way  
[All again]: But together we shall overcome  
[Maid]: Overcome  
But you can't break a spirit  
And you can't heal a dream  
[Maid]: Dream  
Do you have anymore gum?  
More gum, more gum, more gum  
[Billy]: Do you have anymore gum?

We all heard what happened at the skating rink today  
When Whitey brought up your sad past, you snapped and walked away  
Well maybe they're onto something that you should give a try  
Go ahead and let it out, and have yourself a cry  
  
Let it out, Davey!  
Aw shut your wooden mugs!  
Let it out, Davey  
Would you check out her bazugs?!  
  
You all need to deal with pain? Well cheers is what I say  
This here stuff just numbs the pain, it don't make it go away  
You try to act so tough, but you just live a lie  
Why don't you show your feminine side and have yourself a cry?  
  
Let it out, Davey  
I'll pour you down the sink  
You gotta do it, Davey  
Y'all can bite my dink  
  
You labels and logos are wastin your time  
Makin me sit here  
Cause nothin you can say or do  
Will make me shed a tear  
  
He possesses a strong spirit  
And won't let down his guard  
So now we'll bring him the big gun  
His beautiful Hannukkah card  
  
"Happy Hannukkah to our wonderful son  
You fill our lives with joy  
Don't ever change the way you are  
You beautiful, twelve year old boy"

This is a song by AFI, you guys don't have any AFI on here at all and that's
disgraceful.  
"Don't waste your touch,  
you won't feel anything  
Or were you sent to save me?  
I've thought too much,  
you won't find anything...  
Worthy of redeeming  
Yo he esta-do agui muchas veces antes y regreso To...  
break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
Imperfect cry, and scream in ecstasy  
So what befalls the flawless?  
Look what I've built,  
it shines so beautifully  
Now watch as it destroys me  
Y regreso agui otra vez y comienzo To...  
break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
Break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
I left it all behind,  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all behind,  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all behind,  
and never said goodbye  
I left it all to die I saw it's birth,  
I watched it grow I felt it change me I took the life,  
I ate it slow  
Now it consumes me I...  
break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
Break down, and cease all feeling  
Burn now, what once was breathing  
Reach out, and you may take my heart away  
...Heart away"

Once I thought I saw you in a crowded hazy bar  
Dancing on the light from star to star  
Far across the moonbeam I know that's who you are  
I saw your brown eyes turning once to fire  
  
You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays  
I want to love you but I'm getting blown away  
  
I am just a dreamer but you are just a dream  
And you could have been anyone to me  
Before that moment you touched my lips  
That perfect feeling when time just slips  
Away between us on our foggy trip  
  
You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays  
I want to love you but I'm getting blown away, blown away  
  
You are just a dreamer and I am just a dream  
You could have been anyone to me  
Before that moment you touched my lips  
That perfect feeling when time just slips  
Away between us on our foggy trip  
  
You are like a hurricane, there's calm in your eye  
And I'm gettin' blown away  
To somewhere safer where the feeling stays  
I want to love you but I'm getting blown away, blown away, blown away

Where's my Peggy Sue?  
I could use a Rosalita  
If there's a Long Tall Sally out there  
I'm dyin' to meet her  
  
Why can't I hear Beth callin' me?  
Why can't I be the one to make Sara smile?  
I wish I was arm in arm with Jean genie  
Walkin' down the aisle  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
  
But I got no Mary Jane  
There's no Sloopy or Dancin' Queen  
I'm just a fool in the rain  
Waitin' on my Billie Jean  
  
I want an Angie, a Mandy, a Candy-O  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna, Diana, a sweet Caroline  
I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
  
Well, I never got to scream for a Layla  
I never saw Mary-Anne walkin' away  
I never danced on the sand with a Rio  
Or woke up with a Maggie May  
  
I dialed 867-5309  
But there was no Jenny Jenny  
Oh, why can't I get myself a brown-eyed girl  
When Willie Nelson loved so many?  
  
And why does Jack have Diane?  
And why does Billy Joe have Bobbie Sue?  
And everybody had Roxanne  
Except you-know-who  
  
I want an Angie, a Mandy, a Candy-O  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna, Diana, a sweet Caroline  
I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
Well I'd take any ol' Suzy Q  
I got no reason to be picky  
She can be a Goody-Goody-Two-Shoes  
Or she can be my Darling Nikki  
  
Oh, Brandy would be such a fine girl  
And so would the sweet Judy Blue  
I guess I sound just like that other fella  
'Cause you know I wish I had Jessie's girl too  
  
Oh yeah, all right  
  
Well, I'd die for a kiss from Allison  
Even though I know she'd break my heart  
Or give me a Lo-lo-lo-lola  
Minus the extra part  
  
I want an Angie, a Mandy, a Candy-O  
A devil in a dress of blue  
A Rosanna, Diana, a sweet Caroline  
I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
You know I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
Well, I'd even take a Run-Around Sue  
  
Oh yeah, all right

It all seemed so long ago  
Young and happy don't you know  
Down by the creek I would show  
Fireflies to that girl  
  
But that was back when he was nice  
Before my warm heart turned to ice  
My sister's wig once had lice  
But that was long ago  
  
The schoolyard's where we were  
The first time I kissed her  
He thought he got some tongue  
But it was only retainer  
  
Eleanore's bra is a trainer  
Well, over there's my family home  
And the woods we used to roam  
The only time I had sex was on the phone  
  
But that was long ago  
I carved our names upon that tree  
I loved him and he loved me  
My darling wife was once a he  
  
But that was long ago  
He'd always whisper in my ear  
But then I started drinkin' beer  
My jewels got licked by six frisky deer  
  
Now he's just a loner and a lier  
And my trailor's caught on fire, fire?

And feeling sad  
You come around  
And make me glad  
I got you  
Oh, my little chicken  
  
I love your feet  
I love your breasts  
I love the way you eat gravel  
To help you digest  
Oh, my little chicken  
  
People say you're using me  
In your heart you're a killer  
But I know the worst  
I should fear is  
A slight case of salmonella  
So lie right back  
Don't you cry  
If an egg can fit in there  
Why can't I.....mmmmmmm  
Oh my little  
  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawk  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawk  
Bawk, Bawk, Bawk, Bawking Bawk,

like to call em, Sonny!  
Didn't look it  
Actually, it was a nice wake-me-up for my laticerace muscles  
Water's pretty nice, huh?  
Boy, oh boy, the Hawaiin sea's like a warm cup of java!  
Temperaturo perfecto as the Africans might say!  
Yeah, yeah... So listen to me for a sec, when the set comes in,  
just stay flat on the board, pointed towards the beach. I'll tell  
you when to start paddelin, and keep paddelin til the wave grabs you  
I hear ya! Let Mother Nature do her duty!  
Right on...  
Right now!  
Yeah, right now...  
Yeah!  
Then when I say stand up, hop up quick like I showed ya and ride  
Affirmative, captain!  
But don't go too far right, there's a lot of nasty coral over there  
Well here comes a triple overheader right now! Let me tear  
into that sucker!  
I dunno, that's comin awfully steep, Pibb  
No steeper than that tsunami I rode back in 1928 on my  
grandpappy's TV tray! Let's do this!  
You're the boss, Pibb... Start paddelin, now!  
Will do!  
Paddle! Paddle! Paddle!  
Paddle, paddle, fiddle faddle! I love it!  
Okay, okay, you're in it, baby! Stand up! Stand up, Pibb!  
I'm standin! I'm standin! Whoo hoo, I'm up!  
Yeah, man! Way to go Pibb!  
I'm speedin along here!  
(different man) Hey, old man, you better pull out before you  
hit that reef!  
Well, thanks, amigo, but I didn't come out here for no six second ride!  
Bail out, Pibb!  
Not until I get the tube! Aaaah!!!  
(crashing and cracking noises)  
(different man from before) Oh, nasty brudda!  
Hang on, Pibb, I'll be right there! Oh my God, that was sick!  
You okay, Mr. Pibb!?  
Is there a doctor in the house? Oooooh!!!  
(another wave hits, more cracking and crashing)

What's the matter honey, are you not feeling well?  
It's okay, Momma will take care of you  
Not really sick, but don't you know I still say I am  
Dad just mumbles, "There goes my girlie son acting up again"  
  
How could you be my kid  
Mom knows I'm faking it  
But she understands what'll happen if I go  
The last four days  
  
The tough guys have been on a roll  
They show him no mercy  
Plenty of name calling  
And pushing my head in the toilet bowl  
  
They call him a loser  
But they won't get their hands on me today  
'Cause home with Momma is where I'm gonna stay  
  
We're pickin' daisies  
Who cares about them anyway  
Pickin' daisies  
They'll all be working for you someday  
  
Pickin' daisies  
They're just jealous of you  
Pickin' daisies  
Next year you'll go to private school  
  
Can't play sports or games  
I'm only really good at reading  
He can't catch a football  
Apparently that's not too cool  
  
That's why my nose is usually bleeding  
Plus they give him fat lips  
At this time yesterday, my underwear was over my head  
But I'll be safe today, I know 'cause Momma said  
  
We're pickin' daisies  
Who really cares what they think  
Pickin' daisies  
You should talk about it with your shrink  
  
Pickin' daisies  
They'll all end up in jail  
Pickin' daisies  
Marshall's is having a sale  
  
I know tomorrow it'll all start up again  
He'll be greeted with a head-lock  
And all I can do is sit and pray for the weekend  
But I know when I'm older  
  
I'll look back and laugh  
At all those kids who pulled my pants down  
And took that photograph  
'Cause we'll be through with kickball  
  
We'll all be weak and slow  
But I will be the only one  
With a magic place to go  
  
Pickin' daisies  
You're better off in the end  
Pickin' daisies  
Who cares, I'll be your friend  
  
Pickin' daisies  
You can always count on me  
Pickin' daisies  
I made you some iced tea  
  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin' daisies  
Dasies  
Pickin' daisies  
  
You are too very handsome, just not in a traditional way  
When I was a kid, we didn't have video games, we had pinball, but I could
learn  
Well, they're just upset that they don't have earmuffs  
You can come to aerobics class with me and watch, all the ladies love you  
Who needs brand name shirts? Yours is the same thing without a fancy tag  
Why don't you go to sleep? And when you wake up, then I'll play you the Eddie
Fisher record

Oh say I can't see  
Where the hells my visine  
And my eye sights not to keen  
I hope your not driving  
Who's fat sacka and new pipe  
We get fucked up all night  
And the weed is not stale  
It's ok to inhale  
Get the munchies like hell  
Then we run to the bell  
Hit the bong one more time  
Then pass it cuz it's mine  
Oh say does that weed get me soo high!  
Legalize it today  
And get smoked out tonight

  
  
  
My mom bought you when I was just 13,  
the brightest red sweatshirt I ever seen.  
She got an extra large so I wouldn't grow out,  
"That's too big for you!" the other kids would shout.  
But we stuck together, we didn't quit,  
and now the children say, "What a perfect fit."  
  
I love you sweeeeatshirt  
red hooded  
sweeeeatshirt  
dip dip dip  
sweeeeatshirt  
shama lama ding dong  
sweeeeatshirt.  
  
I like to rest my hands in your kangaroo pouch,  
it makes them feel comfy like a big soft couch.  
And I don't care if the weather's no good,  
I say "See you later rain" as I pull up my hood.  
Remember that long bus trip when I needed a nap?,  
I used you as a pillow on that Spanish lady's lap.  
I love you sweeeeatshirt red hooded  
sweeeeatshirt  
dip dip dip sweeeeatshirt  
shama lama ding dong

Oh what is it about you that makes me so jolly?,  
Is it your fifty cotton or your fifty poly?  
  
I don't knoooooooww  
ohh ohh hoo hoo hoo.  
  
Oh red hooded sweatshirt we been through a lot together like that time I
played in that shirts and skins basketball game and I  
had to take you off and throw you in the corner of the gym. I was midway
through the game and then I saw you looking at me.  
You were staring as if to say "Adam, you suck at basketball, you dribble like
a damn woman." I was so mad I challenged you  
to a game of one on one and you know sweatshirt, even though I beat you 11 to
9, deep in my soul I know you missed those  
lay-ups on purpose. You let me win and that why I'll forever feel this way.  
  
I love you sweeeeatshirt  
red hooded

[Russel:]  
"Come on Robert! Pitch it in there, baby!  
We're behind you here in right field! One down!  
Two to go! Hum it now! Yeah! Show 'em the magic! This chump can't hit!"  
"Please God, don't help him hit it to me.  
Anywhere but to right field. Please God, I bet you."  
"Come on now! No batter! No batter! Big whiffer! Big whiffer!"  
"Oh please, don't let him hit it to me. My God, not to me."  
"Steam it baby! Steam it!"  
"Oh God no, Oh God no, Oh God no, Oh God no."  
  
[Russel:] "No!"  
"Oh good! It's not to me."  
"Good catch, Steven! Nice glove!  
You da man! Two away now! Lookin' good!  
We're all looking good out here! Come on Robert!  
This lump of crap can't hit!"  
"Oh God, he's a leftie! A big leftie!  
Total power to hit it. He's gonna pile it right to me and there's nothing I
can do to stop him."  
"Pitch 'em the funny one, Robert! Big whiffer! Big whiffer!"  
"Oh he is a natural athlete and I am so worthless.  
Please God, take his life. Make him die."  
"No batter! No batter!"  
  
[Russel:]  
"Oh God. This is not happening.  
No, don't do this to me. Please. Make it stop."  
"Oww! My elbow!"  
  
[M1:] "Throw it to second! Pick it up already!"  
[Russel:] "Take it! Just take the ball!"  
[M2:] "Nice throw, you pansy!"  
  
[Russel:]  
"Ok, get under control.  
Easy now, easy. Say something to the team."  
"Good hussle everybody! Yeah! Nice work! Play's at third!"  
"That wasn't funny, Lord. I've been so good and for what!?"  
"Come on, Robert! Settle down! Just throw straight!  
You get it across the plate! We'll take care of the rest!"  
"Oh no, another lefty."  
  
[Russel:] "No! Why me again!?"  
"Oww! My neck!"  
"I can't breath. I can't breath."  
  
[M2:] "Pick it up and throw it, you moron!"  
[Russel:] "Here... Come on, here... Take the ball! Take it!"  
[M1:] "Way to kick it in, Pele!"  
  
[Russel:]  
"Oh hahaha. Pele! Good one! Hehehe...  
Ok! Come on! Suck it up guys! We'll get those runs back!  
This is where we dig down!  
We just need one more out!"  
"Oh look! A rightie! Oh Lord, thank you. Thank you so much. I owe you."  
"This loser can't hit! No batter! Come on, this is where we take them out!"  
"Uh oh, what's happening? Where's the rightie going? What?  
Who's this guy? He's a leftie and he's pinch hitting. No! No!"  
"Why's he pointing at me!?"  
  
[Russel:] "Oh my Lord! What have I done to deserve this?!"  
[M3:] "I got it! I got it!"  
[M3:] "Whoa! Sorry about that, Russel. Are you ok?"  
[Russel:] "Hell yeah! We're up now! It's our turn to kick a little ass!"  
[M3:] "All right, Russel. I think you're up first."  
[Russel:] "No!"

So many presents,  
So little time,  
Santa won't be coming around my house this year,  
Cause I tried to drown my sister and I pierced my ear,  
Oh mama made it perfectly clear,  
Santa don't like bad boys... Especially jewish ones.  
  
Gnip-gnop and lego blocks are all that I desire,  
So why did I have to set the pizza guy's hair on fire,  
I told him I was sorry,  
I'm a liar,  
So no toys for me... I don't deserve them.  
  
I couldn't wait for a big wheel as the holiday neared,  
But then I told my grandma that she had a beard.  
  
Dear santa,  
  
I know what my problem is, why I can't be good, it's a fear of intimacy.  
You see my whole life whenever I've met someone really great like you and  
I keep feeling like I'm getting close to them, something inside me makes  
Me want to screw it up. So in a weird way the reason I'm so bad is because  
I love you santa.  
  
Rock-em sock-em robots is what I was hoping for,  
But then I made a death threat to vice president gore,  
Oh santa won't be knocking on my door,  
Cause he's a big fat whore... What made me say that?  
  
Chutes and ladders would be so good indeed,  
So why'd I have to sell that cop a bag of weed,  
So santa please give me that easy bake oven,  
I swear I thought billy goats we're made for lovin'.  
  
So santa won't you accept my apologies,  
Santa can't you see I'm begging you please,  
Oh santa next year I'll do you right,  
Live from new york it's saturday night...

Though I have been a fool for love  
I have finally made my score  
I got a girl, and I don't mean to boast  
But she loves me the most  
  
Even though she's a highly paid whore  
She'll give head to a sheep  
She can stuff three cocks in her cheek  
But she comes home to me  
  
She'll do the groom and the best man  
She'll slap your ass in the back of a van  
But she comes home to me  
She could fuck nine guys in a row  
  
But still have a tenth for me  
And I'm the only one who gets to kiss them lips  
Unless you pay an extra fifty  
So mister, don't you fall in love  
  
'Cause I'm the only cat who doesn't wear a glove  
Since her heart belongs to me  
She has a throat that just won't quit  
She can take all of it  
  
And still have room for your balls  
But she shops in the malls for me  
She'll say twelve then call back and say one  
But I don't care I know it's just work not fun  
  
When she blows you, Jack  
Don't you think she's not thinking of me  
She'll go down on a yack, lick a horse's nutsack  
But strictly for the cash  
  
And it's only me who doesn't pay a fee  
to watch her put a water bottle in her gash  
(Put a water bottle in her gash)  
She'll let you suck her nips till they're leakin'  
  
But don't you dare try to go antique-ing  
'Cause she does that with me  
Her pussy's sweet as honey  
But when she moans, it's just for the money  
  
Unless she's sittin' on me  
She'll cram your asshole with a mouse  
But she won't do it in our house  
Tough luck, Jack  
  
She knows that don't fly with me  
She might eat your wife's box  
But she won't tell ya where you left your socks  
She rolled up and down your fat prick  
  
But it was me who took her to the Meg Ryan flick  
She's got a face full of nuts  
And a mouth full of cocks  
She's done Seal, Larry King, four New Kids on the Block,  
  
She blew the Winnepeg Jets right after a game  
But they never got to know her actual name  
On your face she will piss  
On your chest she might poop  
  
But she won't prepare her famous vegetable soup  
That's simply reserved..  
Oh she'll bite ya, she'll spank ya  
But she'll never thank you for free  
  
'Cause baby... comes home to me.  
Comin' home!

Ok, I just want to warn you that when I wrote this song I was listening to the
Cure a lot.  
  
You don't know how much I need you.  
While you're around I don't feel blue.  
And when we kiss I know that you need me too.  
I can't believe I found a love that's so pure and true.  
  
But it all was bullshit.  
It was a goddamn joke.  
And when I think of you and I,  
I hope you fucking choke.  
  
I hope you're glad with what you've done to me.  
I lay in bed all day long feeling melancholy.  
You left me here all alone, tears running constantly.  
  
Oh somebody kill me please,  
Somebody kill me plee-ase,  
I'm on my knees,  
pretty pretty please kill me.  
  
I want to die.  
Put a bullet in my head.  
  
You're going to the mental institution.

Hanging with my sweet amour  
She came out with a lion's roar  
Yelling, "I'm going to the corner store,  
Be back at quarter to four"  
"Don't slam your pinkies in the drawer"  
She can be like a maiden from the days of yore  
Hanging out at Studio 54  
Break dancing on the slick brick disco floor  
With Lionel Richie  
Who, by the way, was a Commodore  
One time she gave mouth-to-mouth to a snaggle tooth boar  
Who couldn't breat right since the Vietnam War  
Then she played Chinese Checkers with Skeletor  
And went camping with Eva Gabor  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she's coming home  
I got a picture of her down by the seashore  
Wearing a bikini made of purple velour  
Her hair's up like Conway Twitty's pompadour  
With the smile of Guy Lefleur  
She got the ups and downs like an elevator  
But deep inside she's a marshmellow smore  
Can bake a cake as big as Jupitor  
Either or, Neithor nor  
She'll share it with your Labrador  
She can run faster than a blazing meteor  
Loves Winnie the Pooh and his friend Eeyore  
Can make a pipe out of an apple core  
That's a trick she learned from Roberto Parrish  
Down in Ecuador  
You know why?  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she's coming home  
Well, for sure she opened the door  
Whipped out a 3-ft fishing lure  
Sexually, that made me insecure  
Like the time I was a roadie  
On Elton John's tour  
She said, "Let's go catch some Piscatore!"  
I said, "Beatrice, you don't eat fish no more."  
She said, "By God, you're right!"  
So we took ourselves a snore  
And when we woke up 10 hours later  
We made Love Du Jour  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
She's my sweet Beatrice  
And she came home  
She likes to clean out the attic every now and then  
She's gonna knit me a brand new golfing bag  
We gonna watch ourselves a John Wayne movie  
Then we gonna free all the doggies at the kennel  
She gonna try on my third grade mittens  
She'll keep 'em on even though they're way too small  
Well, she ain't never gonna hurt me  
She ain't never gonna let me down  
She ain't never gonna tell nobody  
I'm afraid of birds and spiders  
Well, Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
Bea-bea-bea-beatrice  
And she loves Pat Summerall

If you're comin' from the street with dirty shoes on your feet  
That's a technical foul  
If you switch the radio to some (?) music show  
That's a technical foul  
  
If you don't shut the door  
After using the frigerator  
That's a technical foul  
A technical foul  
  
If you touch the thermostat  
You'll get hit with a bat  
Cause that's a technical foul  
(You will feel my wrath)  
If your hair clogs the drain  
You'll know the meaning of pain  
Cause that's a technical foul  
(I'll show you no mercy)  
  
Ho, this is such bullshit-ah!  
Hey!  
In this house we say bull STICK  
Or it's a technical foul  
A technical foul  
  
If I don't spray Lysol after moving a bowel  
That's a technical foul  
If I decide to wash my ass with your monogram towel  
That's a technical foul  
(Please say hiney!)  
  
If I make fun of your crazy feeties  
Or give sugar cookies to Miss Diabetes  
That's not really a technical foul  
But possibly a homicide  
  
Can I sleep past three?  
If you do, you'll get a T!  
Take a whiz in those flowers?  
I'll say hit the showers!  
Use this horn as a bong?  
Adios, Tommy Chong!  
Make some long distance calls?  
You'll get a kick in the balls!  
Oops!  
  
Can I walk around with my morning erection?  
If you want an automatic ejection  
Cause that's a technical foul  
But I'd like to see it anyway  
Just kidding  
  
There are certain rules which apply in one's life  
With your sister, friends, or imaginary wife  
  
(Adam)  
I can't believe I haven't killed myself  
Here with Wigs McGee and the Furry Elf  
She's (???) and he's so small  
How did I get stuck in this shit hole?  
Guess I'll have to deal with your demands  
But please don't touch me with your alien hands  
  
(Whitey)  
(??) carries over beyond my court  
Whether you're a Jewish guy, (???) or especially short  
I think I'll sing to my (???)  
My imaginary wife is named (???)  
  
(Elenore)  
They took my wig  
I remember the look in their eyes  
Why, oh why  
Won't someone retreive my wig, wig, wig  
  
I got no right to growl  
Watch out, she's on the prowl  
Without my wig, I look like an owl  
Hoo hoo!  
(Oh my God!)  
  
Don't laugh at her!  
Or it's a technical foul  
A technical foul  
A technical foul

Gotta go."

To him."

Richie: "What? Well, who's there? Why can't you talk?"  
Samantha: "Uh, just look Richie, someone is here."  
Richie: "Who's there? Is it a guy!?"  
Samantha: "Richie!"  
Richie: "I knew it! I'll kill him! Put him on the phone!"  
Samantha: "oh.. it's just.. hold on."

Above her belly  
Button."  
Richie: "Yeah, well that's too bad! But I'm still gonna come over there  
And beat your face in!"  
[Richie slams down phone]  
Samantha: "What happened? Was he mad?"  
Buffoon: "My neighbor's dog has a four inch clit!"  
Samantha: "Oh Buffoon, you're the coolest." [Whispering] "I love you..."  

When I was just a little wee lad  
I hopped on the lap of my dear old dad  
Something jumped and poked me good  
'That' he said 'just me morning wood'  
A little tin soldier's marchin by  
Sergeant major unzips his fly  
Pulls his weapon from his camouflage pants  
Slaps away til it starts to dance  
A shootin star's above my bed  
Changin colors of my mushroom head  
A rainbow jizz flys across the room  
Little white spermies meet their doom  
(Ah!) The amazing Willy Wanker!  
(Aaaah!) The amazing Willy Wanker!  
And my scrotum sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!  
Little green men from outer space  
Here to exterminate the human race  
Drop their ray guns and retreat to their ships  
When marshmallow sauce squirts from me tip  
Like a knight of olden Camelot  
The goo takes off like an arrow shot  
Gwynevere drops to her knees and begs  
For the spittin dragon between me legs  
I'm using my thing for what it's for  
Gentle knock upon me door  
Mumsy drops her cup of tea  
When she sees my wank standing tall and free  
(Ah!) The one and only Willy Wanker!  
(Aaaaah!) Here comes Willy Wanker!  
And my marble sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!  
Rasberry scones and marmalade!  
Squeezing my squid in the evening shine!  
Visions of mermaids in the sky!  
Shooting my load in me own left eye!  
Gramps was a hero in the first World War  
But he ain't got no dick no more  
Comes home smokin from the corner pub  
Makes poor old Gramsy kiss his nub  
The world spins around like a big bass drum  
Nanny pops a pinkie in the generals bum  
The Irish dance and the Scotsmem howl  
Time to clean up with the washroom towel  
(Ah, yeah!) It's only Willy Wanker, yeah!  
(Ah!) The lonely Willy Wanker!  
And my wrinkled sack he says  
Lalalalalala, tickle me!

"And now the buffoon's date at the drive-in with the school's  
Valedictorian."  
Valedictorian: "I really appreciate you're asking me out. Most people  
Are intimidated by my high academic achievement."  
Buffoon: "This movie sucks shit!"  
Valedictorian: "Well, Ebel gave it thumbs up, but Ciscel thought it was  
Too preachy. Anyway, I enjoyed the director's last film immensly."  
Buffoon: "Cathleen Turner has big fuckin' tits!"  
Valedictorian: "Yes, well, she recently had a child. I think her  
Maternal biology may play a role in that. She looks fabulous for a woman  
Her age, doesn't she?"  
Buffoon: "I put a firecracker in a bullfrog's mouth and blew his fuckin'  
Head off."  
Valedictorian: "Well, in psychology we learned that it is not uncommon  
For male adolescents to commit savage acts on animals as part of their  
Maturing process."  
Buffoon: "That girl in the fucking car in front of us, she gives  
Everybody head."  
Valedictorian: "Well, I guess she's strong for attention and she feels  
Promiscuity is the only way to obtain it."  
[Buffoon eating popcorn]  
Buffoon: "This popcorn's fuckin' terrible. It tastes like someone jizzed  
All over it."  
[Buffoon continues to eat popcorn]  
Valedictorian: "Well the amount of semen on this popcorn is certainly  
Disturbing. Perhaps the staff in the refreshment stand was overcome by  
The monotony of their work and decided to play a childish prank."  
Buffoon: "I looked at my asshole in the mirror today. It blew my fuckin'  
Mind!"  
Valedictorian: "It's ironic that parts of one's body seems odd and  
Unusual because you don't see them on a day to day basis.  
Buffoon: "My father's shit stinks up the bathroom all fuckin' day!"  
Valedictorian: "It's puzzling why one person's fecal odor can be more  
Overpowering than another's. I wonder whether it is a function of the  
Food digested or that person's internal metabolism."  
Buffoon: "I'm gonna go get head from that fuckin' girl."  
[Gets out of the car]  
Valedictorian: "Well, I'm sorry to see the date come to such an abrubt  
Conclusion."  
[Buffoon walking away]  
"I do appreciate the time you spent with me and look forward to a future  
Rondevue."  
Buffoon: "I like to piss in that guy's fuckin' gas tank!"  
Valedictorian: "Bye bye! Have fun."  
[Buffoon continues to walk away]  

Chanukah is  
The festival of lights.  
One day of presents?  
Hell no, we get the eight crazy nights!  
But if you still feel like the only kid in town  
Without a Christmas tree,  
I guess my first two songs didn't do it for you,  
So here comes number three!  
  
Ross and Phoebe from Friends  
Say the Chanukah blessing,  
So does Lenny's pal Squiggy and Will and Grace's Debra Messing!  
Melissa Gilbert and Michael Landon never mixed meat with dairy,  
Maybe they should have called that show  
Little Kosher House on the Prairie!  
We got Jerry Lewis,  
Ben Stiller, and Jack Black,  
Tom Arnold converted to Judaism,  
But you guys can have him back!  
(Just kidding, Tommy!.)  
  
We may not get to kiss  
Underneath the mistletoe,  
But we can do it all night long  
With Deuce Bigalow!  
  
Rob Schneider: I'm Jewish!?!?!  
  
Drei-Dels: Put on your yarmulke, here comes Chanukah...  
  
Rob Schneider: The guy in Willie Nelson's band who plays harmonica celebrates
Chanukah!  
  
Adam Sandler: Tiny Elvis everybody. Tiny Elvis. Schneider, I didn't even know
you were jewish.  
  
Rob Schneider: I'm a filipino jew. In fact, I'm going home right now to light
the first pig.  
  
Adam sandler: okay, get going.  
  
Osama bin Laden...  
  
The Driedels: boo!  
  
Not a big fan of the Jews!  
Well maybe that's because he lost the figure skating match  
To gold medalist Sarah Hughes!  
(Her mama's Jewish.)  
Houdini and David Blaine escape straightjackets  
With such precision,  
But one thing they could not get out of...  
Their painful circumcision!  
Gwyneth Paltrow's half-Jewish,  
But a full-time Oscar winner,  
Jennifer Connelly's half-Jewish too,  
And I'd like to put more in her! Whoo!  
There's Lou Reed, Perry Farrell,  
Beck, and Paula Abdul,  
Joey Ramone invented punk rock music,  
But first came Hebrew school!  
Hey!  
  
Natalie Portmanika  
It's time to celebrate Chanukah,  
I hope I get an Abtronica  
On this joyful, joyful Chanukah,  
So get a high colonika  
And soil your long-johnnakahs  
If you really, really wannakah,  
Have a happy, happy, happy, happy,  
Happy, happy, happy, happy Chanukah! "

Diner.  
Waiter: hi, what can I get you today?

Plate for that with the chicken, your chicken fried steak...the blue plate  
Special, does that come with the soup of the day, or-  
Waiter: I'll come back when you're ready.  
Excited southerner: hoooo...  

Me, I'm the Lonesome Kicker  
Extra points, field goals at your service  
One might think it comes with glory  
You might think different after you listen to my story  
  
My helmet is equipped with a tiny face mask  
What it possibly could protect, I do not know  
The other guys on the team  
Like to make fun of my little shoulder pads  
And also like to hide the special shoe  
I need to kick in the snow  
  
People think it's so easy  
To kick a field goal from the 30 yard line  
They forget to add seven yards for the snap  
And 10 more 'cause the goal posts are pushed way back  
  
In 1974, the uprights were right on the goal line  
But some of the players were running into them  
And getting hurt  
So screw the kicker  
Who cares about the kicker?  
  
But I kick that ball  
And I pray it goes straight  
If it does  
The coach says "Good job, number 8"  
He doesn't even know my name is  
Andre Kristacovitchlalinski, Jr.  
But that's the life I live  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Kickoffs can be so very scary  
Especially, if the returner breaks on through  
And I'm the only guy on the playing field left to tackle him  
I don't want to get hurt  
So I pretend to tie my shoe  
  
Once again, I'm ignored by my teammates and all my coaches  
"Go back where you came from!"  
Scream 70,000 fans  
Well, I know I could win their love back  
By catching a winning touch-down  
But, unfortunately, I was born with these very small hands  
  
And I hope that the cameras don't come in too close  
'Cause they might see the tears in my eyes  
As I sit on this bench made of cold-hearted wood  
And the splinters go deep in my thighs  
And the towel boy snickers as he walks by  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Another blocked kick  
And everybody blames me  
But it was the Left Guard  
Who didn't pick up his man  
Oh, why can't they see...  
  
In my home country  
I could have been a minor league soccer player  
But I came to America  
Seeking fortune and seeking fame  
I didn't realize that if I shanked one  
And blew the point spread  
Some drunk guys would push me into their hibachi  
After the game  
  
So I go home at night  
'Cause I never get invited  
To go drinking with the other guys  
And I sit in my chair, and I soak my foot  
As I eat a plate of cold french fries  
And my wife's out with her quote-unquote friend  
And my son can't look me in the eyes  
But that's the life I live  
The Lonesome Kicker  
  
Kicking for you  
They took my snow shoe  
They're going for two

"Hey man, let me in there first"  
"Go ahead man, take it easy"  
"Thanks, I really gotta pee"  
  
"Oh man"  
"Ohhh yeah"  
"Ahhhh"  
"Ahh"  
  
"Oh man!" [Repeat x 5]  
"Oh man! Oh..."  
"Oh no!"  
"Oh Man!"  
"Ahhh"  
"Ahhhhhh... There ya go"  
  
"Oh! Oh man!"  
"Oh my god!"  
  
"I'll be out in a minute!"  
"Oh... Oh my"  
"Oh... Oh thank God"  
  
"Awwww man!"  
  
"Hey man, you pissed in your pants"  
"I know"  
"So did I"  
"I guess that makes us piss pals"  
Ha ha ha!

My girlfriend left me for a seven foot Indian  
My grandma hung herself on a tree in the Caribbean  
My sister's on the dope and my brother always picks his nose  
And Daddy's only happy when he's wearing Mama's pantyhose, yeah  
I just lost my job to a God damn robot (Good times!)  
Then my dog got in the freeze box, he ate everything I got  
But I've got my mule  
He's a very, very nice mule  
He walks with me home from school  
Cause he's a very, very nice mule  
When he was a baby my mother fed him gruel  
But now he prefers to dine on his own stool  
He always philosophizes with the rabbis after shul  
Cause he's a very, very pious mule  
When he sees a picture of a carrot he has a tendency to druel  
On Halloween he tries to scare me by dressing up as a ghoul  
He once challenged someone who stole my hat to a duel  
Cause he's a very, very Old school mule  
A needle-nosed plier is his favorite tool  
He lifeguards on a volunteer basis and the Rec. Center pool  
When I break down on the side of the road he shows up with unleaded fuel  
He's a devoted fan of Ms. Paula Abdul  
And also approves of the recent makeover of former folkie Jewel  
(coughing)  
When I told him Halle Berry's husband cheated he just shook his head and said
to himself 'what a fool'  
Cause he's a very, very monogamous mule  
(snoring) Porkchop! Wake up, man, the session's not over!  
After several well-publicized arrests for public urination he now drinks
exclusively O'Doul  
And every year he puts on a presentation at the Boys Club to show kids smoking
isn't cool  
His favorite Elvis song is 'Don't be Cruel', no it's 'Hound Dog'  
I was just kidding you

Hey there Mr. Leaf Blower Man  
Keep it down for goodness sake  
It's way too early in the morning  
Can't you please use your wooden rake?  
You choose to ignore I  
Even though me hungover  
That's not being nice  
So tonight, your head will be covered in lice  
  
Voodoo spell on you  
Voodoo Voodoo  
You shouldn't have given that dirty stare  
Voodoo Voodoo  
Too late for sorry, go cut off your hair  
  
Hey there old, old woman  
Shopping for food at the store  
Why'd you run your cart into I  
And knock me eggs on the floor  
Then took the last unbruised cantelope  
And laughed so loud with glee  
But you won't be laughing  
'cause from now on it'll burn when you pee  
  
Voodoo spell on you  
Voodoo Voodoo  
You couldn't have made I any madder  
Voodoo Voodoo  
That's why I put a curse on your bladder  
  
Boodaloo Boodalay  
Boodalee Boodalie  
Are the words that he say  
When you fuck with I  
Voodoo  
  
Hey there Mr. State Trooper  
Me was only going 58  
Please don't you write up that ticket  
It'll ruin me insurance rate  
You say you have a quota to meet  
So straight to hell with I  
Me have only one response  
Boodalee Boodalie  
  
Voodoo spell on you  
Voodoo Voodoo  
You cost I 80 dollars cash  
Voodoo Voodoo  
Me hope you like your new skin rash  
  

Hey you guys, I just wanted to thank you for listening to the record and I
hope you had as much fun as I did and here's one last little diddy just for
you.  
I used to ride my big wheel, and sell lemonade,  
Eat popcorn with grandpa while we watched the parade  
But now I'm only happy when I'm drinking J.D.  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
I used to have fun throwing snowballs with my best friend Billy  
And Mom would make us cocoa if we got too chilly  
But now I only get excited when I see a girl pee  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
I used to be the nicest kid in the neighborhood  
I only did the things that Momma said I should  
But now I just do whatever I want  
I even whipped it out in a restaurant  
  
I used to help clean the park in the middle of town  
And then played kickball til the sun went down  
But now all I do is get VD,  
What the hell happened to me?  
  
It makes no sense  
I can't believe I ended on me  
I'm out of my gourd  
Won't somebody please, help me?  
  
A do-do-do-do doo a do-do waa do-do-we-oh  
  
I'm kind of a wierdo

Well, I had myself a girlfriend  
For almost two whole years  
We had no secrets  
We had no fears  
There was nothing we wouldn't do  
When we were in the sack  
She'd even pop the zit on my back  
  
But one night I was out cheating  
After I drank a few  
She caught me red handed  
And said we're through  
Now she's got a new boyfriend  
It nearly gave me a heart attack  
  
'Cause who's gonna pop this zit on my back?  
Well I got a pimple and I don't know why  
It keeps growing in the same place  
I can't reach it with my left or right hand  
I wish it was on my face  
It's four days old  
And it hurts so bad  
But it's ready for a squeeze  
Won't somebody pop it for me please?  
I'll give you ten dollars  
  
If you're a girl in this lonely world  
And you're looking for a guy  
I'll never cheat again, I promise  
That's no lie  
There's only one thing I ask of you  
Could we name our first child Zak?  
Oh, one more thing  
Please pop this zit on my back  
  
I'm dying here!  
A pimple ay-hee  
A pop-a-doodly-doo  
Squirt heedly-hoo  
  
Well I'm sitting alone by the phone  
And no one seems to call  
I try to scrape my zit off on the kitchen wall  
Well that don't work, so I look around  
And find a big shiny thumb-tack  
Put it on the floor, lay down  
Pop the zit on my back
