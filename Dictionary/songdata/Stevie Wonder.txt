Like a long lonely stream  
I keep runnin' towards a dream  
Movin' on, movin' on  
Like a branch on a tree  
I keep reachin' to be free  
Movin' on, movin' on  
'Cause there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
There's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Got to find me a place in the sun  
Like an old dusty road  
I get weary from the load  
Movin' on, movin' on  
Like this tired troubled earth  
I've been rollin' since my birth  
Movin' on, movin' on  
There's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
I know there's a place in the sun  
And before my life is done  
Got to find me a place in the sun  
You know when times are bad  
And you're feeling sad  
I want you to always remember  
Yes, there's a place in the sun  
Where there's hope for everyone  
Where my poor restless heart's gotta run  
I know there's a place in the sun  

We have time for racism  
We have time for criticism  
Held bondage by our ism's  
When will there be a time to love  
  
We make time to debate religion  
Passing bills and building prisons  
For building fortunes and passing judgments  
When will there be a time to love  
  
At this point in history we have a choice to make  
To either walk a path of love  
Or be crippled by our hate  
  
We have time to cause pollution  
We have time to cause confusion  
All wrapped up in our own illusions  
When will there be a time to love  
  
We make time to conquer nations  
Time for oil exploration  
Hatred, violence and terrorism  
When will there be a time to love  
  
At this moment in time  
We have a choice to make  
Father God is watching  
While we cause mother earth so much pain  
It's such a shame  
  
Not enough money for  
The young, the old and the poor  
But for war there is always more  
When will there be a time to love  
  
We make time for paying taxes  
Or paying bills and buying status  
But we will pay the consequences  
If we don't make the time to love  
  
Now's the time to pay attention  
Yes now is the time to love  
A time love, love  
A time to Love  
Please, please won't you tell me  
When will there be a time to love

There's a warm little home on a hill  
And the presents are hiding somewhere  
And the world is so peaceful and still  
You can almost hear love in the air  
  
There's a blanket of snow on the ground  
And a bright little star in the sky  
And your heart knows that Santa is near  
By the twinkle in everyone's eye  
  
There's gift bringing and bells ringing  
And warm little feet by the fire  
There are kids playing and folks praying  
And somewhere the sound of a choir  
  
There's two people that never will part  
And two stockings we still have to fill  
There's a warm little place in my heart  
For our warm little home on the hill

The strangest thought came to me on this morning  
As I awake to greet the coming dawn  
The sun was hardly peaking through the garden  
It felt that with everything, I was one  
Then I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower, as a flower  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower  
To spread the sweetness of love  
To spread the sweetness of love  
The dew had finished making love to many  
A rainbow smelling sweet was in the air  
I envied all the silence I saw growing  
So unmoved by things outside of themselves  
And how I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower, as a flower  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower  
To spread the sweetness of love  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
Oh, as a flower, as a flower  
How I wished that I could come back as a flower  
As a flower, as a flower  
To spread the sweetness of love  
To spread the sweetness of love  

Now, baby when you sigh  
(when you sigh)  
I wanna sigh with you  
When you cry  
(when you cry)  
I wanna cry some, too  
  
Now, ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
Oh, ain't that love that I feel  
(that I feel)  
In my heart for you  
  
When your friends  
(when your friends)  
Turn their back on you  
I'll be here  
(I'll be here)  
Just to see you through  
  
Now, ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
Ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
Ain't that love, oh now  
Ain't that love  
That I feel in my heart for you  
  
Now when you walk  
(when you walk)  
I wanna walk with you  
When you talk  
(when you talk)  
Wanna talk some, too  
  
Now, ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
Oh, ain't that love that I feel  
(that I feel)  
In my heart for you  
  
If you ever  
(if you ever)  
Ever need a friend  
I'll be with you  
(be with you)  
Yes, until the end  
  
Now, ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
Ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
Don't you know, baby  
Don't you know, I  
(oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Ain't that love,  
Baby that I feel  
In my heart for you  
  
Baby, won't you let me  
Hold your hand  
I want to squeeze you  
As tight as I can  
Baby, don't you need  
My by your side  
To protect you and  
Be your guide  
Baby, I'm so in love with you  
I'd do anything you tell me to  
  
Now, ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
Ain't that love  
(ain't that love)  
C'mon now, ain't that love, now  
(oh, oh, oh, oh)  
Ain't that love,  
Baby that I feel  
In my heart for you  
Oh, that I feel in my  
Heart for you  
Oh, that I feel in my  
Heart for you  
Oh, that I feel in my  
Heart for you  
Oh!

All is fair in love  
Love's a crazy game  
Two people vow to stay  
In love as one they say  
But all is changed with time  
The future no one can see  
The road you leave behind  
Ahead lies mystery  
But all is fair in love  
I had to go away  
A writer takes his pen  
To write the words again  
That all in love is fair  
All of fate's a chance  
It's either good or bad  
I tossed my coin to say  
In love with me you'd stay  
But all in war is so cold  
You either win or lose  
When all is put away  
The loosing side I'll play  
But all is fair in love  
I should never have left your side  
A writer takes his pen  
To write the words again  
That all in love is fair  
A writer takes his pen  
To write the words again  
That all in love is fair

As around the sun the earth knows she's revolving  
And the rosebuds know to bloom in early may  
Just as hate knows love's the cure  
You can rest your mind assure  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As now can't reveal the mystery of tomorrow  
But in passing will grow older every day  
Just as all that's born is new  
You know what I say is true  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky)  
Always  
(Until the ocean covers every mountain high)  
Always  
(Until the dolphin flies and parrots live at sea)  
Always  
(Until we dream of life and life becomes a dream)  
  
Did you know that true love asks for nothing  
No no her acceptance is the way we pay  
Did you know that life has given love a guarantee  
To last through forever and another day  
  
Just as time knew to move on since the beginning  
And the seasons know exactly when to change  
Just as kindness knows no shame  
Know through all your joy and pain  
That I'll be loving you always  
  
As today I know I'm living  
But tomorrow could make me the past  
But that I mustn't fear  
For I'll know deep in my mind  
The love of me I've left behind  
'Cause I'll be loving you always  
  
(Until the day is night and night becomes the day)  
Always  
(Until the trees and seas just up and fly away)  
Always  
(Until the day that eight times eight times eight is four)  
Always  
(Until the day that is the day that are no more)  
Did you know you're loved by somebody  
(Until the day the earth starts turnin' right to left)  
Always  
(Until the earth just for the sun denies itself)  
I'll be lovin' you forever  
(Until dear mother nature says her work is through)  
Always  
(Until the day that you are me and I am you)  
Always  
(Until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky  
Until the ocean severs every mountain high)  
Always mm mm  
  
We all know sometimes life hates and troubles  
Can make you wish you were born in another time and space  
But you can bet your lifetimes that and twice it's double  
That God knew exactly where he wanted you to be placed  
So make sure when you say you're in it, but not of it  
You're not helpin' to make this earth  
A place sometimes called hell  
Change your words into truths  
And then change that truth into love  
And maybe our children's grandchildren  
And their great grandchildren will tell  
I'll be loving you until the rainbow burns the stars out in the sky

Close your eyes 'til the morning  
Close your eyes 'til the early dew  
Get inside what you've been missing  
Are the very first words that I heard coming from you  
  
Take a chance on the secret  
That you hide for beneath your dreams  
Use your wildest imagination  
You just tell me what it is and I will make it be  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
Let's get high on the happy  
With a toast to you and me  
Love is here just for the giving  
And between us we've got all the love we'll ever need  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go  
  
As if you read my mind  
As if you touched my soul  
As if you knew exactly where I wanted to go

It's been seven hours and fifteen days  
Since you took your love away  
I go out every night and sleep all day  
Since you took your love away  
Since you been gone I can do whatever I want  
I can see whomever I choose  
I can eat my dinner in a fancy restaurant  
But nothing  
I said nothing can take away these blues  
  
'Cause nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
  
It's been so lonely without you here  
Like a bird without a song  
Nothing can stop these lonely tears from falling  
Tell me baby where did I go wrong  
I could put my arms around every boy I see  
But they'd only remind me of you  
I went to the doctor n'guess what he told me  
Guess what he told me  
He said girl you better try to have fun  
No matter what you'll do  
But he's a fool  
  
'Cause nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
  
All the flowers that you planted, mama  
In the back yard  
All died when you went away  
I know that living with you baby was sometimes hard  
But I'm willing to give it another try  
  
Nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
Nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you  
Nothing compares  
Nothing compares to you

Your name is big brother  
You say that you're watching me on the tele,  
Seeing me go nowhere,  
Your name is big brother,  
You say that you're tired of me protesting,  
Children dying everyday,  
My name is nobody  
But I can't wait to see your face inside my door.  
  
Your name is big brother  
You say that you got me all in your notebook,  
Writing it down everyday,  
Your name is I'll see ya,  
I'll change if you vote me in as the pres,  
The President of your soul  
I live in the ghetto,  
You just come to visit me 'round election time.  
  
I live in the ghetto,  
Someday I will move on my feet to the other side,  
My name is secluded, we live in a house the size of a matchbox,  
Roaches live with us wall to wall,  
  
You've killed all our leaders,  
I don't even have to do nothin' to you,  
You'll cause your own country to fall.

How many roads must a man walk down before they call him a man?  
How many seas must a white dove sail before she sleeps in the sand?  
How many times must the canon balls fly before they're forever banned?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
How many years must a mountain exist before it is washed to the sea?  
How many years can some people exist before they're allowed to be free?  
How many times can a man turn his head and pretend that he just doesn't see?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
How many times must a man look up before he can see the sky?  
How many ears must one man have before he can hear people cry?  
How many deaths will it take till he knows that too many people have died?  
The answer, my friend, is blowin' in the wind  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  
The answer is blowin' in the wind.  

Can you picture mother earth?  
In the palm of your hand  
The entire universe  
As a tiny grain of sand  
And it feels impossible to do  
As I can't imagine love without you  
Think of drinking every sea  
With it's salty waters dry  
Sprinting 'round the world three times  
Faster than a rocket fly's  
And the thought of it you can't pursue  
As I can't imagine love without you  
Some thoughts just know great news  
Not worth the amount of time  
Yet others inconceivable  
So they never cross your mind  
Travel back through life and times  
One Atlanta summers night  
Add up every single star  
Since the day the first was light  
How and when they started, I have no clue  
As I can't imagine love without you  
Yet others inconceivable  
So they never cross your mind  
Travel back through life and times  
One Atlanta summers night  
Add up every single star  
Since the day the first was light  
How and when it started, I have no clue  
And the thought of it you can't pursue  
Cause it feels impossible to do  
As I can't imagine love without  
I can't imagine love without, you  
  

You just could not know how long we tried  
To see how this building looks inside  
This must be a lucky day for me  
Because the sign says there's a vacancy  
Look I know you came a long way  
But you made it just too late  
So we had to give it to somebody else  
Well I talked to you on the phone less than fifteen minutes ago  
And you told me that it was cool  
I graduated from Howard U.  
My job is paying good money too  
And if you check on my resume  
You'll find they all wanted me to stay  
  
Well I can't take the time out  
To check your credit card  
Cause the computer just broke down today  
Well I'll stop by here tomorrow to complete our interview  
But I know what you're gonna say  
I know what your bottom line is  
  
You might have the cash but you  
Can...not cash in your face  
We don't want you living in here  
Say you might have the cash but you  
Can...not cash in your face  
We don't want your kind living in here  
Too-oo, too-oo too bad,  
Too-oo, too-oo too sad  
  
Our first child is due here any day  
That's why we're desperate for a place to stay  
The location is so perfect too  
So please try to do what you can do  
  
Well in this apartment complex no children are allowed  
And if you told me that I could have saved you a lot of time  
Well I thought the Bill was passed that said you could not discriminate  
But I know some excuse you'll find  
Because your bottom line is  
  
You might have the cash but you  
Can...not cash in your face  
We don't want you living in here  
Say you might have the cash but you  
Can...not cash in your face  
We don't want your kind living in here  
Aye, you might be a great doctor  
You might be a great lawyer  
You might possess the key to the city  
Or maybe a politician  
You might have the cash but you  
Can...not cash in your face  
We don't want you living in here  
Say you might have the cash but you  
Can...not cash in your face  
We don't want your kind living in here

Mm  
On the beach where young lovers meet  
You can see them there as they sit and build  
Castles in the sand  
  
Heavenly she's so heavenly  
When she smiles at you  
And she helps you build castles in the sand  
  
The time comes when you stop pretending  
For all dreams must come to an ending  
Remember what happens to castles of sand  
The sea will wash them away  
Oh  
  
And the beach where they used to meet  
By the sand and sea waves have washed away  
Castles in the sand  
Castles in the sand  
Where did they go  
Castles in the sand  
Tell me, where did they go  
Castles in the sand  
I wanna know where did they go

People goin' round  
Tellin' others they are square  
Around and round in circles  
Is a ride that goes somewhere  
All you need to fly  
Is a heart dying to try  
A chemical love  
It's a chemical love  
  
Ain't nothin to it  
Gettin' cash when you are broke  
Doin' lots of time  
Is worth a little snort of coke  
Infected needles  
Can aid you in no time  
Through chemical love  
You've got a chemical love  
  
Some people crave for physical love  
Some people crave material love  
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love  
You've got a chemical jones  
You've got a chemical love  
  
Yeah, a chemical love  
You've got chemical love  
  
Some people find themselves hooked on the  
weirdest things  
That have nothing to do with living  
God's gift to us is our life what's ours to him  
If it's not our love, then nothing's given, given  
  
Some people crave for physical love  
Some people crave material love  
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love  
You've got a chemical jones  
For a chemical love  
  
Yes it's true  
The best things in life are free  
Not material  
Chemical or physically  
Try it for yourself  
You'll get a guaranteed high  
From spiritual love, natural miracle drug  
  
Some people crave for physical love  
Some people crave material love  
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love  
You've got a chemical jones  
You've got a chemical love  
  
You've got a chemical love  
For a chemical drug  
  
Some people crave for physical love  
Some people crave material love  
Yet fewer crave for spiritual love  
You need a spiritual jones  
For that spiritual love  
  
I'm talking to you  
We all could do with spiritual jones  
For some spiritual love

Feelin' young and full of fun  
Hangin' out with my crew  
Hot to trot and about to pop  
Tryin' to find some girl to get into  
  
There she was fine as can be  
Hair braided down to her knees  
She took me home, she turned me out  
But before sunrise she said I must leave  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night  
  
Far from meek, and feelin' chic  
Refusing to concede defeat  
There I was same crew, same time  
Same club we kicked it at the previous week  
  
I asked her how could she have the nerve  
To treat me with such disgrace  
She blinked her eyes, smiled, apologized  
Threw her drink right in my face  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
A cold chill, a cold chill, a cold chill, cold chill  
  
Weekends came and weekends passed  
But not the yearning in my heart  
And there she was to light the spark  
Like she did right from the very start  
  
I took no time, drove to her house  
Got deep into a passion high  
I heard a knock, the turn of a key  
And the voice of another guy  
  
It was a cold chill on a summer night  
Never thought the girlie wouldn't treat me right  
It was a cold chill on a summer day  
Never thought the girl would dog me out that way  
It was a cold chill on a summer morn  
Never cried like a baby since the day I was born  
It was a cold chill on a summer eve  
Never had no chopper bring me to my knees  
  
I was feeling so trusting  
Gave it all right down to the bone  
But she did me wrong  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
On a summer night, on a summer night  
  
It was a cold chill  
Like standing in the deep freeze  
A cold chill  
Like when snow's above your knees  
Cold chill  
Like sitting at the north pole  
A cold chill  
Wearing not one stitch of clothes  
Cold chill  
Like a winter Chicago night  
A cold chill  
Twenty ice cubes down your back for spite  
Cold chill  
Stranded in sub-zero degrees  
A cold chill  
Laid out on the arctic sea  
Cold chill  
When your fingers get frost bite  
A cold chill  
Buried beneath ten feet of ice  
Cold chill  
Baby, that ain't so nice  
A cold chill

He and his wife have had problems  
That he's played off like nothing's wrong  
'Til he comes home from work early  
Just to find the girl is gone  
Oh but he gets into the cupboard  
Picks out that bottle of gin  
Drinks like there's no tomorrow  
And decides to take a spin  
  
No don't drive drunk  
Don't drive drunk, no  
Don't drive drunk  
Mothers Against Drunk Drivers are mad  
  
Teenager at a live party  
Says, "give me one for the road"  
But he's already so inebriated  
If you lit a smoke he'd explode  
But bartender says, "I don't think so"  
Young one says, "I can deal"  
Staggering out he says, "check you all later"  
But I really don't think he will  
  
No don't drive drunk

Please baby, come on, child  
Oh lord, baby  
Come on, all night long  
Turn your lamp down low  
Cause I love you so  
Baby please come on  
Love your daddy all night long  
You hear me talkin', baby  
Baby please come on

For once in my life I have someone who needs me  
Someone I've needed so long  
For once, unafraid, I can go where life leads me  
And somehow I know I'll be strong  
  
For once I can touch what my heart used to dream of  
Long before I knew  
Someone warm like you  
Would make my dreams come true  
  
For once in my life I won't let sorrow hurt me  
Not like it hurt me before  
For once, I have something I know won't desert me  
I'm not alone anymore  
  
For once, I can say, this is mine, you can't take it  
As long as I know I have love, I can make it  
For once in my life, I have someone who needs me

All the gold in all the world  
Is nothing to possess  
If all the things that it can bring  
Can't add up to one ounce of your happiness  
  
And for your love  
I would do anything  
Just to see the smile upon your face  
For your love  
I would go anywhere  
Just you tell me and I'll be right there  
  
A diamond that shines  
Like a star in the sky  
Is nothing to behold  
For minuscule is any light  
If it can't like you brighten up my soul  
  
And for your love  
I would do anything  
Just to see the smile upon your face  
For your love  
I would go anywhere  
Just you tell me and I'll be right there  
  
I could have never fathomed this  
Such joy, love and tenderness  
That you give to me  
For the love I feel inside  
It's so wonderful I can't hide  
And I glow, I glow  
With just the thought of you  
I do, I do, I do, I do, I do, I do  
  
And for your love  
I would do anything  
Just to see the smile upon your face  
For your love  
I would go anywhere  
Just you tell me and I'll be right there

This is fun day  
Yours and my day  
This is fun day, dee oh, wee oh  
  
This is fun day  
On a fine day  
When the air is filled with tweeting birds that sing  
Together in the sun  
This is your day  
Yours and my day  
When you feel the joy of children playing,  
Laughing from dust till dawn  
On a day like this you share your joy  
With everyone  
Share your peace, and share your joy,  
And share your love  
  
This is fun day  
On a fine day  
When you feel the urge of getting up to start-up  
With the break of dawn  
This is your day  
Yours and my day  
When you turn on your radio and hear the DJ  
Playing your favorite song  
On a day like this not even bad can rub  
You wrong  
'Cause you say it's okay 'cause it's your day  
  
I'm gonna go out to the park  
Where you feel the joy in every heart  
That's what I need to start each day off right  
Oh, I'll find a place for you and me  
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree  
Fun day should be each day in all our lives  
  
This is fun day  
Yours and my day  
This is fun day, dee oh, wee oh  
  
This is love day  
A celebration  
A day on every calendar that's set aside  
For everyone to give  
This is your day  
Such a fun day  
I cannot believe a day like this has come  
That's if this really is  
I'm so very proud to say that for this day I've lived  
To see your peace, to see your joy, and to  
sSe your love  
  
I'm gonna go out to the park  
Where you feel the joy in every heart  
That's what I need to start this day off right  
  
Oh, I'll find a place for you and me  
Underneath the shade of a lover's tree  
Fun day should be each day in all our lives  
  
This is love day  
A celebration  
A day on every calendar that's set aside for  
Everyone to give  
  
Let me solo, let me solo, let me solo, solo

You are so unpredictable  
When I am not  
You are so irresistible  
That I can't stop  
You say my name  
And I start walking on heaven  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What extraterrestrial planet are you from  
You're much more than life  
You're from galaxy paradise  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What will they say when they find that you're gone  
Say you'll stay in life  
Queen from galaxy paradise  
  
You are so unforgettable  
And I will not  
Our love's far more than sensual  
And twice as hot  
You touch my hand  
And I know that we'll love forever  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What extraterrestrial planet are you from  
You're much more than life  
You're from galaxy paradise  
  
What flying saucers did you come here on  
What will they say when they find that you're gone  
Say you'll stay in life  
Queen from galaxy paradise

I'm happier than the morning sun  
And that's the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life.  
  
I'm happier than the morning sun  
And that's the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life.  
  
All my life I was alone,  
Didn't think I'd find my part,  
Now I see there's joy inside your arms.  
  
Every day I searched for the star,  
That never was in the sky,  
And now I see this star is on earth.  
  
And I'm happier than the morning sun  
And that's the way you said that I would be  
If I gave you a chance to come inside my life.  
  
And I am happier than the morning sun  
And that's the way it will always be  
Ever since the day you came inside of my life.  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom I love you.  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom I love you.  
  
And I'm happier than the morning sun  
And that's the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life.  
  
I'm happier than the morning sun  
And that's the way you said it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life.  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
Bom bom bom I love you.  
  
Bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom bom  
  
Bom bom bom I love you.  
  
Happier than the morning sun  
That's the way you said it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside my life.  
  
I'm happier than the stars above  
That's the way you said that it would be  
If I should ever bring you inside of my life.  
  
I believe that everyone should be  
Happier than the morning sun  
Happier than the morning sun  
Happier than the morning sun  
Happier than the morning sun

You know it doesn't make much sense  
There ought to be a law against  
Anyone who takes offense  
At a day in your celebration  
'Cause we all know in our minds  
That there ought to be a time  
That we can set aside  
To show just how much we love you  
And I'm sure you would agree  
It couldn't fit more perfectly  
Than to have a world party on the day you came to be  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
I just never understood  
How a man who died for good  
Could not have a day that would  
Be set aside for his recognition  
Because it should never be  
Just because some cannot see  
The dream as clear as he  
That they should make it become an illusion  
And we all know everything  
That he stood for time will bring  
For in peace our hearts will sing  
Thanks to Martin Luther King  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Why has there never been a holiday  
Where peace is celebrated  
All throughout the world  
The time is overdue  
For people like me and you  
Who know the way to truth  
Is love and unity to all God's children  
It should never be a great event  
And the whole day should be spent  
In full remembrance  
Of those who lived and died for the oneness of all people  
So let us all begin  
We know that love can win  
Let it out don't hold it in  
Sing it loud as you can  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday to you  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday  
Happy birthday  
Ooh yeah  
Happy birthday  
We know the key to unify all people  
Is in the dream that you had so long ago  
That lives in all of the hearts of people  
That believe in unity  
We'll make the dream become a reality  
I know we will  
Because our hearts tell us so

There are people who have let the problems of today  
Lead them to conclude that for them life is not the way  
But every problem has an answer and if your's you cannot find  
You should talk it over to Him  
He'll give you peace of mind  
When you feel your life's too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
  
Many of us feel we walk alone without a friend  
Never communicating with the One who lives within  
Forgetting all about the One who never ever lets you down  
And you can talk to him anytime He's always around  
When you feel your life's too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
  
Well He's the only free psychiatrist that's known throughout the world  
For solving the problems of all men, women, little boys and girls  
When you feel your life's too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
  
When you feel your life's too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
When your load's too much to bear  
Just go talk to God He cares  
I know he does  
  
When you feel your life's too hard  
Just go have a talk with God  
Thank-you  
Thank-you very much

They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away  
And just the pure at heart will walk her righteous streets someday  
They say that heaven is ten zillion light years away  
But if there is a God, we need Him now  
"Where is your God"  
That's what my friends ask me  
And I say it's taken Him so long  
Cause we've got so far to come...  
  
Tell me people  
Why can't they say that hate is ten zillion light years away  
Why can't the light of good shine God's love in every soul  
Why must my color black make me a lesser man  
I thought this world was made for every man  
He loves us all, that's what my God tells me  
And I say it's taken Him so long  
Cause we've got so far to come...  
  
But in my heart I can feel it, yeah,  
Feel His spirit wow oh woo...  
Feel it, yeah, feel His spirit...  
  
I... can't say that heaven is ten zillion light years away  
But if so let all be pure at heart  
Just to walk her righteous streets I pray  
Let God's love shine within to save our evil souls  
For those who don't believe will never see the light  
"Where is my God" - He lives inside of me  
And I say it's taken Him so long  
Cause we've got so far to come...  
No people, "where is your God?"  
Inside please let Him be  
And I say it's taken Him so long  
Cause we've got so far to come...  
  
But if you open your heart you can feel it yeah yeah  
Feel His spirit, yeah  
Feel it, feel His spirit, wow oh wow...  
Feel it, you can feel His spirit  
I opened my heart one morning and  
I sho nuff could feel it yeah yeah  
Feel His spirit yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit  
You can feel it, yeah, feel His spirit

Hey love  
May I have a word with you?  
I'd like to tell you, yeah  
Just what I've been going through  
My nights are so long  
As I watch each hour go by  
Hoping and praying  
That someday I will be your guy  
  
Hey love  
You're my one true soul desire  
Hey love, baby  
Can you feel this burning fire  
  
Hey love  
There's one thing I find so true  
When you are near me  
I go through a change or two  
Hearing your footsteps  
I hurry to catch your eye  
And I stand there waiting, yeah  
But girl, you just walk on by  
  
Say love  
With a cold heart you are dealing  
Hey love, yeah  
It's an awful hurting feeling  
  
Hey love  
Don't pass me without some sign  
Just look me over, yeah  
I want to change your mind

Hold me darling hold me  
And I'll always be your, be your guy  
Closer, baby come closer  
Let me be the one that loves and be by your side  
  
Why should you be lonely when I need you so  
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go  
So hold me, baby hold me  
Say you'll never let me go  
  
Why should you be lonely when I need you so  
Give my arms a chance I know I'll never let go  
So hold me, baby hold me  
Say you'll never let me go  
  
You know I love you so  
I'll never-never let you go  
I'll never let you go  
Oh baby-baby, hold me  
Why should we be apart  
I'll never-never let you go

I don't know why I love you  
I don't know why I love you  
I don't know why I love you  
But I love you  
  
Always treat me like a fool  
Kick me when I'm down that's your rule  
I don't know why I love you  
But I love you  
  
Oh you never stop your  
Cheatin' ways with another guy  
You laugh in my face  
Lord how long must I be disgraced  
  
Cause I love you  
Oh baby, baby, baby  
I don't know why I love you  
I don't know  
  
You and me baby, oh  
I don't know why I love you baby  
But I love you baby  
Oh darlin', darlin', darlin'  
  
You throw my heart down in the dirt  
You made me crawl on  
This cold black earth, baby  
No I never, I never knew  
  
How much love could hurt  
Until I loved you baby  
'Til I loved you baby, baby  
Oh baby, I can't stop  
  
I can't stop crying can't you see  
Here I'm pleadin' on my knees  
I'm on my knees  
Won't you help me, help me please  
  
Cause I love you, I love you baby  
Sure enough, baby, yeah  
I don't know, you don't know  
We don't know none of us  
  
Can't do nothing about it  
I don't know, I don't know  
Oh baby, I don't know, I don't know  
Nobody can do nothing about it

I took a worthless trip  
Down life's avenue  
Just to try to find a way to smile again  
While I was on my way  
I met a wise man who said  
That happiness you only find within  
I learned my lesson then  
  
So I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
I go sailing  
Be surprised what you can find  
I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
Take a chance on your mind  
Be surprised what you'll find  
  
I took a friend's advice  
Who said go up and away  
Take the magic of a mystery tour  
But I felt so all alone  
Though I could almost touch the stars  
I started missing things I touched before  
The tour was such a bore  
  
So I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
I go sailing  
Be surprised what you can find  
I go sailing  
Through the rivers of my mind  
Take a chance on your mind  
Be surprised what you'll find  
(Repeat)

Isn't she lovely  
Isn't she wonderful  
Isn't she precious  
Less than one minute old  
I never thought through love we'd be  
Making one as lovely as she  
But isn't she lovely made from love  
Isn't she pretty  
Truly the angel's best  
Boy, I'm so happy  
We have been heaven blessed  
I can't believe what God has done  
Through us he's given life to one  
But isn't she lovely made from love  
Isn't she lovely  
Life and love are the same  
Life is Aisha  
The meaning of her name  
Londie, it could have not been done  
Without you who conceived the one  
That's so very lovely made from love

I've always come to the conclusion that 'but' is the way  
Of asking for permission to lay something heavy on ones head  
So I have tried to not be the one who 'll fall into that line  
But what I feel inside I think you should know  
  
And baby that's you you you  
Made life's his-to-ry  
'Cause you've brought some joy inside my tears  
And you have done what no one thought could be  
You've brought some joy inside my tears  
  
I've always felt that tomorrow is for those who are too much afraid  
To go past yesterday and start for today  
I feel that lasting moments are coming fr and few between  
So I should tell you of the happiness that you bring  
Baby, baby it's you you you  
Made life's history  
Oh baby, you've brought some joy inside my tears  
Baby you have done what no one thought could be  
You brought some joy inside my tears  
You brought some joy inside my tears  
You brought some joy inside my tears  
  
You've brought some joy inside my tears  
Baby, baby you have done what no one thought could be  
He why, you brought some joy inside my tears  
Gotta tell you  
You you you made life's history  
You brought some joy inside my tears  
You brought you brought you brought some joy inside my tears  
Baby baby baby you have done what no one thought could be  
You brought some joy inside my tears

You you you made life's his-to-ry

You brought some joy inside my, tears

I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever

We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
  
She can't love me, I can't love her  
Cause they say we're the wrong color  
Staring, gloating, laughing, looking  
Like we've done something wrong  
Because we show love strong, get real, come on  
Calling us names too bad to mention  
But we pay them no attention  
For color blind are inner feelings  
If we feel happiness  
And know our love's the best, forget their mess  
  
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
I've gone white-girl crazy, she's gone black-boy hazy  
We're each other's baby, we're in love  
  
Everyone's created equal  
Hell with all you ignorant people  
Trying to stereo type us  
You really ought to quit  
Cause you don't know jack, you make us sick  
Get off my jock, you're trying to ride me  
Because I got my girl beside me  
You'll only make yourself look stupid  
I love you're trying to dis  
Cause we've got happiness, I bet you're pissed  
  
I've got jungle fever, she's got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love  
She's gone black-boy crazy, I've gone white-girl hazy  
Ain't no thinking maybe, we're in love  
She's got jungle fever, I've got jungle fever  
We've got jungle fever, we're in love

You were brought up in a small town  
Where everyone greeted with a morning smile  
I mean the place was so free from crime  
You could leave your front door open  
And if your eyes were drawn from a lack of food  
Or your pockets were short on cash  
There was always someone close at hand  
That you could always run to  
  
You could have been a doctor  
And you could have been a nurse  
But these things weren't good enough for you  
So you decided to pack up all you own  
And get a one-way ticket there  
To a place where all the successful people went  
In order for them to do  
  
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, land of la la  
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, the land of la la  
  
You get off the bus, pick up a paper  
And look through the classified  
So that you might find a place  
Suitable for you to move into  
Then you turn around to pick up the duffel bag  
That you brought along  
But much to your surprise you find  
Your bag has taken off walking  
  
You dig in your wallet  
To get your last dime  
But then recall you just spent your last dime on the newspaper  
You're much too prideful  
But pride has no defense  
When all you've got in your possession  
Is the wallet in your hands  
  
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
I'm a big boy now, she's a strong girl  
Remember only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la  
  
L.A., L.A., la la, la la, L.A., hey hey, living in the land of la la  
  
You might get everything you want  
But not want everything you get  
Being in la la land is like nowhere else  
Living in the land, one hell of a land, a land full of lost angels  
Movie stars and great big cars and Perrier and fun all day  
And that's enough to make anybody go wild  
In the land of la la  
He's a big boy now, she's a strong girl  
But only the strong can survive  
Living in the land of la la

Lately, I have had the strangest feeling  
With no vivid reason here to find  
Yet the thought of losing you's been hanging 'round my mind  
Far more frequently you're wearing perfume  
With you say no special place to go  
But when I ask will you be coming back soon  
You don't know, never know  
Well, I'm a man of many wishes  
Hope my premonition misses  
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide  
Cause they always start to cry  
Cause this time could mean goodbye  
Lately I've been staring in the mirror  
Very slowly picking me apart  
Trying to tell myself I have no reason with your heart  
Just the other night while you were sleeping  
I vaguely heard you whisper someone's name  
But when I ask you of the thoughts your keeping  
You just say nothing's changed  
Well, I'm a man of many wishes  
I hope my premonition misses  
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide  
Cause they always start to cry  
Cause this time could mean goodbye, goodbye  
Oh, I'm a man of many wishes  
I hope my premonition misses  
But what I really feel my eyes won't let me hide  
Cause they always start to cry  
Cause this time could mean goodbye

Oh baby, you know that it would be untrue  
Know that I would be a liar  
If I was to say to you  
Hey girl, you know we couldn't get much higher  
Hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Come, baby, light my fire, yeah  
Try to set the night on fire  
The time to hesitate is through  
There's no time to wallow in the mire  
If we try now we can only lose  
And our love may come a funeral pyre  
Hey, hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Come on, baby, light my fire, yeah  
Try to set the night on fire, oh baby, baby  
Hey, hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Oh baby, come on, baby, light my fire  
Try to set the night on fire, yeah baby, oh babe  
You know that it would be untrue  
And you know I would be a liar  
Don't let it [Incomprehensible] and say to you  
Hey baby, we couldn't get much higher  
Hey come on, baby, light my fire  
Come on, baby, light my fire, baby, yeah, baby  
Try to set the night on fire, oh baby  
Hey come on, baby, light my fire [Incomprehensible]  
Come on, baby, light my fire, baby  
Try to set the night on fire, oh baby, baby  

Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love  
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love  
  
Lighting up the candles  
To what use to be  
Tender memories in moments of love  
Happy times and bad times  
All seem wonderful  
When you have a toast to moments of love  
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love  
  
Lighting up the candles  
To what use to be  
Tender memories in moments of love  
Happy times and bad times  
All seem wonderful  
When you have a toast to moments of love  
  
I really think we could have made it  
To that forever and a day  
But destiny and fate decided  
They would get in our way  
  
Lighting up the candles  
Wishing you the best  
Like the happiness in moments of love  
For lighting up the candles  
Spark the memories  
Helping us to see more moments of love  
  
I really think we could have made it  
To that forever and a day  
But destiny and fate decided  
They would get in our way  
  
For lighting up the candles  
Spark the memories  
Helping us to see the need for what was  
Helping us to see more moments of love  
  
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love  
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love  
Lighting up the candles, lighting up our love

A boy is born in hard time Mississippi  
Surrounded by four walls that ain't so pretty  
His parents give him love and affection  
To keep him strong moving in the right direction  
Living just enough, just enough for the city  
  
His father works some days for fourteen hours  
And you can bet he barely makes a dollar  
His mother goes to scrub the floors for many  
And you'd best believe she hardly gets a penny  
Living just enough, just enough for the city yeah  
  
His sister's black but she is sho 'nuff pretty  
Her skirt is short but Lord her legs are sturdy  
To walk to school she's got to get up early  
Her clothes are old but never are they dirty  
Living just enough, just enough for the city  
  
Her brother's smart he's got more sense than many  
His patience's long but soon he won't have any  
To find a job is like a haystack needle  
'Cause where he lives they don't use colored people  
Living just enough, just enough for the city  
  
Living just enough for the city  
  
His hair is long, his feet are hard and gritty  
He spends his life walking the streets of New York City  
He's almost dead from breathing in air pollution  
He tried to vote but to him there's no solution  
  
Living just enough, just enough for the city yeah, yeah, yeah!  
  
I hope you hear inside my voice of sorrow  
And that it motivates you to make a better tomorrow  
This place is cruel no where could be much colder  
If we don't change the world will soon be over  
  
Living just enough, just enough for the city!

Everyone's feeling pretty  
It's hotter than July.  
Though the world's full of problems  
They couldn't touch us even if they tried.  
From the park I hear the rhythms  
  
Marley's hot on the box  
Tonight there will be a party  
On the corner at the end of the block.  
  
Didn't know you would be jammin'  
Until the break of dawn.  
I bet you nobody ever told you  
That you would be jammin' until the  
Break of dawn  
You would be jammin' an jammin' and  
Jammin'  
Jam on.  
  
They want us to join their fighting  
But our answer today  
Is to let all our worries  
Like the breeze through our fingers slip away.  
Peace has come to Zimbabwe  
Third world's right on the one  
Now's the time for celebration  
'Cause we've only just begun.  
  
Didn't know you would be jammin'  
Until the break of dawn.  
Bet you nobody ever told you that you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's  
Of the master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of Dawn.  
I know nobody told you that you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's  
Of the master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn.  
We're jammin'  
Jammin'  
Jam on.  
  
You ask me am I happy  
Well as a matter of fact  
I can say that I'm ecstatic  
'Cause we all just made a pact.  
We've agreed to get together  
Joined as children in Jah  
  
When you're moving in the positive  
Your destination is the brightest star.  
  
You didn't know that you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn.  
I bet you nobody ever told you  
That you  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn.  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin'  
Until the brak of dawn  
Don't you stop the music  
Oh no  
  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
(Repeat background)  
  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Would be jammin' until the break  
Of dawn  
I bet you if someone approached you  
Yesterday to tell you that you would be  
Jammin' you would not believe it  
Because you never thought that you  
Would be jammin'.  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
  
( We're in the middle of the makin's of  
The master blaster jammin')  
Jammin' til the break of dawn  
Oh  
Oh  
Oh  
You may as well believe what  
You are feeling because you feel your  
Body jammin'.  
Oh  
Oh  
You would be jammin' until the  
Break of dawn  
(We're in the middle of the makin's of the  
Master blaster jammin')

I'm feelin' down and some kind of lonely,  
Cause' my baby done left me here,  
Heart's blazing like a five alarm fire  
And I don't even give a care  
  
I feel like the world is turnin' on me,  
My dreams turnin' to ashes right in front of my face,  
And I'm gettin' kind of worried,  
And I feel so out of place,  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans,  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans.  
  
(Background) . . I feel like cryin', yeh, yeh  
Maybe baby, baby, baby, baby, baby  
  
In the mornin' when I've got heartache,  
I can't call up the doctor for help,  
Cause' the only person that could ever do me any good,  
Is steppin' out with my best friend.  
  
I feel like I'm slippin' deeper,  
Slippin' deeper into myself,  
And I can't take it,  
This stuff is scarin' me to death,  
  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans,  
Kinda makin' me worried,  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans,  
  
Little Sally Walker, sittin' in a saucer,  
Checkin' out the guys that are passing by,  
  
(Background)...by, by, by, by...  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans  
  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans,  
Not includin' future plans,  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans,  
Maybe my baby done made some other plans,  
Maybe my baby done made another plan  
With another man. Your baby, your baby, stupid baby, your baby,  
That you put so trust so much trust in your baby,  
Maybe your baby done made some other plans.

Moon blue, rivers of love you shine, Bathe me in light sublime  
Flood me with all your glowing heart can give  
Moon blue, memories bind like chains  
When will you come again  
I wait in darkness just for your bright to beam  
'Cause I'm not afraid of the consequence  
Of being in love with you  
And I'd rather be alone some nights  
Awaiting your full hue  
For though the sun makes bright the day  
My world is dark when there's no you  
You light my skies and make dark night bright day, Moon blue  
Moon blue, your beauty's seen by all, the yearning of your call  
Travels the world and then makes home my soul  
Moon blue, lift me to starry heights, I long to live within your light  
Solace of mind, my heart is yours for always  
'Cause I'm not afraid of the consequence  
Of being in love with you  
And I'd rather be alone some nights  
Awaiting your full hue  
For though the sun makes bright the day  
My world is dark when there's no you  
You light my skies and make dark night bright day, Moon blue  

Woke up this morning, my baby's gone  
Woke up this morning, my baby's gone  
I ain't had no loving since my baby been gone  
  
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me  
I ain't got nobody to stay at home with me  
I wonder 'bout my baby, what's gonna happen to me  
  
My baby's gone, gone away from me  
My baby's gone, gone away from me  
My whole life is in misery  
  
My baby's gone, gone away from me  
My baby's gone, gone away from me  
And now I'm worried that you can see

What you want, baby, I got.  
What you need, you know I got it.  
All I asking is for a little respect  
When you come home, baby.  
When you come home,  
Respect.  
  
I ain't gonna do you wrong while you gone,  
I ain't gonna do you wrong 'cause I don't wanna.  
All I asking is for a little respect  
When you come home, baby.  
When you come home,  
Respect.  
  
I'm out to give you all my money  
But all I'm asking in return, honey,  
Is to give me my proper respect  
When you get home, yeah baby,  
When you get home.  
  
Oh, your kisses sweeter than honey  
But guess what, so here's my money.  
All I want you to do for me is give me some here  
When you get home, yeah baby,  
When you get home.  
  
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,  
Find out what it means to me.  
R-E-S-P-E-C-T,  
Hey Boy, T-C-B.  
A little respect

Do do do, do do do, do do do, do do do  
Do do do, do do do, do do do-oo  
  
I longed for you since I was born  
A woman sensitive and warm  
And that you were  
  
With pride and strength no one would test  
But yet have feminine finesse  
And so much more  
  
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
  
A female Shakespeare of your time  
With looks to blow Picasso's mind  
You were the best  
  
Your body moved with grace and song  
Like symphonies by Bach or Brahms  
Nevertheless, oh oh  
  
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
Ooh you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
  
Da da da, da da da, da da da, da da da  
Da da da, da da da-aa  
  
The passion burning in your heart  
Would make hell's fire seem like a spark  
Where did it go  
  
Just why that you would overnight  
Turn love to stone as cold as ice  
I'll never know  
  
But you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
Baby you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
  
Cold, too cold, you took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
Oh, oh, oh, took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to into this cold, cold world  
  
I would not do that to a dog  
Took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
You took me riding in your rocket gave me a star  
But at a half a mile from heaven you dropped me back  
Down to this cold, cold world  
Ooh baby  
Rocket love

Born to open for mankind nature's door  
A life known by a few  
And those who knew that shared  
Their knowledge fewer cared about what plants could do  
For most felt it was mad to conceive  
That plants thought, felt, and moved quite like we  
But with instruments Bose would devise  
Would take science itself by a surprise, so  
On we go to where who knows  
To a place where there's still non-believers  
What will it take for heaven sakes  
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in  
It's that same old story again  
Born of slaves who died too soon to realize  
The need his life would be  
Selflessly he gave  
His wisdom to a way where first no minds would see  
He said, "If farm land was to be rich  
We must plant crops to replenish it"  
But it took him persuasion and tests  
To convince them Canver's way was best, so  
On we go to where who knows  
To a place where there's still non-believers  
What will it take for heaven sakes  
For those who find what's real too hard to believe in  
It's that same old story again  

Packing my bags going away  
To a place where the air is clean  
On Saturn  
There's no sense to sit and watch people die  
We don't fight our wars the way you do  
We put back all the things we use  
On Saturn  
There's no sense to keep on doing such crimes  
  
There's no principles in what you say  
No direction in the things you do  
For your world is soon to come to a close  
Through the ages all great men have taught  
Truth and happiness just can't be bought - or sold  
Tell me why are you people so cold  
  
I'm  
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow  
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow  
On Saturn  
People live to be two hundred and five  
Going back to Saturn where the people smile  
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly  
On Saturn  
Just to live to us is our natural high  
  
We have come here many times before  
To find your strategy to peace is war  
Killing helpless men, women and children  
That don't even know what they're dying for  
We can't trust you when you take a stand  
With a gun and bible in your hand  
And the cold expression on your face  
Saying give us what we want or we'll destroy  
  
I'm  
Going back to Saturn where the rings all glow  
Rainbow, moonbeams and orange snow  
On Saturn  
People live to be two hundred and five  
Going back to Saturn where the people smile  
Don't need cars cause we've learned to fly  
On Saturn  
Just to live to us is our natural high

Lady love and lady cared  
But lady went away,  
And left me all alone to suffer.  
  
And now I feel it's not fair  
For me to fall in love  
The truth is the real me you must uncover.  
  
Seems so long, since I've heard the sound  
It's been so long, since I've trusted in someone else,  
Had to see it all for myself,  
It's been so long, that the world seems cold,  
But I think it's time in my life to find myself again.  
  
Lady loved and lady stayed,  
Until she was too pleased  
She knew I wouldn't leave for her to suffer.  
I'd never make her suffer.  
  
Now I believe you're just like me,  
In that you understand,  
And want me for your man to always love me.  
  
You can believe it's seems so long, since I've touched a wanting hand  
Oh, it seems so long, since I've trusted in someone else,  
Had to see this world for myself,  
And it's been so long that the world seems cold,  
Now I think I've found someone to make me trust in someone again.  
  
I believe that I can trust in you.

Send me some loving  
Send it I pray  
How can I love you  
When you're far away?  
Oh, send me your picture  
Send it my dear  
So I can hold it  
Pretend you are near  
  
Can't you send me your kisses?  
I can feel their touch  
I need you so badly  
I miss you so much  
  
My days are so lonely  
My nights are so blue  
I'm here and I'm lonely  
I'm waiting for you  
  
Can't you send me your kisses?  
I can feel their touch  
I miss you so badly  
I need you so much  
  
My days are so lonely  
My nights are so blue  
I'm here and I'm lonely  
I'm waiting for you

Send her your love  
With a dozen roses  
Make sure that she knows it  
With a flower from your heart  
  
Show him your love  
Don't hold back your feelings  
You don't need a reason  
When it's straight from the heart  
  
I've heard so many say that the days of romance are no more  
And people falling in love is so old fashioned  
But waiting are they the day they once let slip away  
Hiding need to fulfill their heart's desire for love's passion  
  
Send her your love  
With a dozen roses  
Make sure that she knows it  
With a flower from your heart  
  
Show him your love  
Don't hold back your feelings  
You don't need a reason  
When it's straight from the heart  
  
I know that people say two hearts beating as one is unreal  
And can only happen in make believe stories  
But so blind they all must be that they cannot believe what they see  
For around us are miracles of love's glory  
  
Show him your love  
Don't hold back your feelings  
You don't need a reason  
When it's straight from the heart

I've seen you, I saw you, I see you  
Without little notice, if any at all  
Of you knowing me watchin' you  
You walking, you talking, you smiling  
You styling in everything your body wears  
And that's not just a point of view  
They're painting, they're ranting, they're raving  
About Miss Lovely got it going on  
From head down to her toes  
And no one knows better than I know  
Cause I've been listening to the spirit of  
Your body, mind and soul  
  
It's a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body weak  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That makes my psyche say  
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we  
  
Can feel you, can smell you, can taste you  
Though my senses never had the pleasure of  
That lovely wonderment  
But I start to shaking, I shiver, to think that little sparkle in your eye  
Means you are giving me some kind of hint  
I'm ready, I'm willing, I'm able  
In fact those words are at the tip of my tongue  
Eagerly waiting for me to say  
Then you smile and whisper "how are you?"  
But when I move my lips and try to speak the words just go away  
  
It's a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body weak  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That makes my psyche say  
Ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we  
  
It's that sensuous whisper that's got me trippin' out  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That I don't want to do without  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That makes me want to shout  
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we  
  
I don't even care how long it takes  
As long as I have you lying next to me  
Cause to wait forever and a day  
Is a small price to pay if it's you I'm getting  
If it's you I'm getting, I'm not quitting  
And that is how I'm living  
  
I'm clinging, not dreaming, but scheming  
With my nose against the grind and both my eyes focused upon the prize  
I think it, I trust it, I know it  
Your love that I've longed for is gonna be mine  
Good things do come in time  
I'm right on the rhythm you're givin'  
But this is more than giving up some casual mental telepathy  
The music, the candles, the champagne and all that's needed  
Is one thing to give it authenticity  
  
It's a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body weak  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That's sweeter than the sweetest sweet  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That makes my psyche say  
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we  
  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That's got me trippin' out  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That I don't want to do without  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That makes me want to shout  
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we  
  
It's a sensuous whisper  
That makes my body rock  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That makes me beg baby don't ever stop  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That always get me hot, baby  
Ooh wee, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we  
  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That makes me feel alright  
It's that sensuous whisper  
That keep me wanting you morning, noon and every single night  
It's that sensuous whisper  
Don't want you out of my sight, baby  
Ooh we, ooh wee, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we, ooh we  
  
It's that sensuous whisper
