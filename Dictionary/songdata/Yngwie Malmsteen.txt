No more will I do all the things that I've done  
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun  
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away  
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find  
  
His soul had wandered through years of despair  
Eyes without expression told to beware  
For soldiers of fortune have searched low and high  
To find they're forgotten to rest and to die  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find  
  
No more will I do all the things that I've done  
I'll live by the nature of moon and the sun  
I've talked to a stranger whose soul'd gone away  
He warned me 'bout danger I'd been in if I stayed  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find  
  
Anguish and fear is roaming my mind  
Shed an iron tear, I'm trying to find

Feeling restless  
Crave for company  
never gave me  
Any room to breathe  
  
Intuition  
Soon made me wise  
As you ran out of  
Alibis  
Took time to draw the line  
That I can't deny  
Nothing is plain or black and white  
You fight like a tired soldier  
Shielded by wounded pride  
Always pretending to be strong  
Desperately waiting for  
  
Another time, another place  
I don't care no more  
I am the one you can't replace  
A fact you can't ignore  
  
Can you face it  
I'm forever gone  
Dug your own grave  
Shot with your own gun

"There's a hole in the sky Because I don't know but don't ask me why There is
a long way to go Where the road is leading me Future will show I will never
die Cause I will fly To the other side For what is right They do what they
want I'm trying to fight But evil spirits pass me by What you feel or what you
say They just don't care I will never die Cause I will fly To the other side
Because I don't know but don't ask me why There's a hole in the sky There is a
long way to go Future will show Where the road is leading me I will never die
Cause I will fly To the other side "  
  

Living large, living free  
Living the life that dreams are made of  
Dying proud, dying free  
Dying the death of heroes  
But what you've done now  
Makes me wanna cry, keep on pushing  
Well, you've pushed too far  
You must die now  
You must die now  
Once we were free  
Living in perfect harmony  
It's much too late  
And now there's no turning back  
Attack  
Attack  
Attack  
Out of the blue, out of the sky  
The world comes crashing down  
Now it's out of true, we've been blown sky high  
And the king has lost his crown  
We must be fearless and be relentless  
Kill these insects, show no mercy  
You must die now  
You must die now  
Once we were free  
Living in perfect harmony  
It's much too late  
And now there's no turning back  
Attack  
Attack  
Attack  
Once we were free  
Living in perfect harmony  
It's much too late  
Now there's no turning back  
Attack  
Attack  
Attack  

Come on baby, what's on your mind  
You're stumbling in the darkness  
Like you're running blind  
Hey can't you see we've been fooling around  
This same old graveyard  
on the same playground  
Be my late night movie star  
By my nature I can tell who you are  
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes  
There's no innocence  
In your bedroom eyes  
Baby Baby  
Got no self-defense  
For your bedroom eyes  
Over and over then we do it again  
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when  
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around  
Is there any way to stop this merry go round  
Be my late night movie star  
By my nature I can tell who you are  
Through all lies it's in your bedroom eyes  
There's no innocence  
In your bedroom eyes  
Baby Baby  
Got no self-defense  
For your bedroom eyes  
Over and over then we do it again  
Haven't seen a stop sign since I don't know when  
Up and down this lonely street guess I'll see you around  
Is there any way to stop this merry go round

Closing my mouth  
before I scream  
No-one can shake  
my self-esteem  
  
Whisper my name  
confuse my mind  
To me it's the same  
if I'll survive  
  
This game you can't win  
Who is free from sin  
I won't be afraid  
My soul will remain  
  
Go on and sleep  
the sleep of the just  
If your conscience is clean  
do what you must  
  
One day you will know  
I was a friend, not foe  
I won't be afraid  
My soul will remain  
Let go of your hate  
I won't be afraid  
  
I won't be afraid  
My soul will remain  
let go of your hate  
I won't be afraid, oh no...

[Japanese bonus track]  
I paid the piper with my song  
For all the times I've done you wrong  
I watched the devil get his due  
And I knew that was for you  
It breaks my heart  
Our time has passed by telling lies  
I fall apart  
Like broken glass on shattered ice  
We gave up our love within  
To keep ourselves from giving in  
I know my world will always turn  
When you burn, you'll live and learn  
Like an intruder in your arms  
I never meant to do you harm  
I know my song, it will remain  
All the same, I feel the pain  
  
  

Carry on my wayward son,  
For there'll be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Don't you cry no more  
  
Once I rose above the noise and confusion  
Just to get a glimpse beyond the illusion  
I was soaring ever higher, but I flew too high  
Though my eyes could see I still was a blind man  
Though my mind could think I still was a mad man  
I hear the voices when I'm dreamin', I can hear them say  
  
Carry on my wayward son,  
For there'll be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Don't you cry no more  
  
Masquerading as a man with a reason  
My charade is the event of the season  
And if I claim to be a wise man, it surely means that I don't know  
On a stormy sea of moving emotion  
Tossed about I'm like a ship on the ocean  
I set a course for winds of fortune, but I hear the voices say  
  
Carry on my wayward son,  
For there'll be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Don't you cry no more  
  
Carry on, you will always remember  
Carry on, nothing equals the splendor  
Now your life's no longer empty  
Surely heaven waits for you  
  
Carry on my wayward son,  
For there'll be peace when you are done  
Lay your weary head to rest  
Don't you cry no more

Well you're damned if you do  
You're damned if you don't

Fighting the odds while we still have time  
There is a limit don't cross that line  
It's no good with water we cannot drink  
We're a ship about to sink.  
We pray but the wall is just too high  
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky.  
see'est la vie life in the shadows  
see'est la vie there's no tomorrow  
Give us back the blue blue sky  
Where the air is so fresh were eagles fly  
What good is a planet that's slowly dying  
What kind of life can it bring.  
We pray but the wall is just too high  
We pay with our lives to the dark tower in the sky.  
see'est la vie life in the shadows  
see'est la vie there's no tomorrow.

The smoke has cleared  
And I'm still standing here  
  
My world's gone down in flames  
But still I have no fear  
  
You've lied  
You told your tale  
You tried  
To make me fail  
You took your best shot  
Left me to rot  
Through all this I'll never crash and burn  
Lesson learned  
  
Wearing suits  
And driving shiny cars  
  
You money hungry fools  
  
What gives you the right to say  
Who gets to win, who is to lose  
  
You've lied  
You told your tale  
You tried  
To make me fail  
You took your best shot  
Left me to rot  
Through all this I'll never crash and burn  
Lesson learned  
Crash and burn  
Lesson learned  
You're such fools  
  
Through all this I'll never crash and burn  
Yeah!!!!  
Lesson learned  
Crash and burn  
Lesson learned

You've always shared the light.  
Although you could clearly see the sacrifice.  
Preaching wrong from right.  
Prosecution was the story of your life.  
The blood money paid.  
A kiss betrayed.  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
And now the curtain is drawn.  
And I can see the moment of some kind of truth.  
They nailed you to the cross.  
Although you walked the righteous path since your birth.  
The blood money paid.  
A kiss betrayed.  
In this final hour.  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
[guitar solo]  
To be crucified.  
And for thirty silver pieces.  
For our sins he died.  
To wear the crown of thorns.  
It was his destiny.  
To be crucified.  
It was his destiny  
  
  

There's a time for all our innocence  
When the tears aren't far away  
And a time to build a strong defense  
When the boy's too old to play  
And we learn the hard way  
Day by day  
Giving in but always coming back for more  
And we cry no more...cry no more.  
There's a time for games and visions  
And the stake is more or less  
There's a time for fast decisions  
When our dreams become success.  
We do anything to raise that score  
Cause the end will always justify the means  
And we cry no more.  
Cry no more...and we cry no more  
Our year's in misery  
Made dreams reality. Ohh  
And we cry no more  
Cry no more...and we cry no more

Welcome to the masquerade  
The ultimate feast  
The party that never fades  
Darkness unleashed  
  
As the earth is turning  
As the souls are burning  
There's no more romance  
  
Deamons will dance  
  
  
Seven million, four hundred  
Five thousand, nine  
Hundred and twenty-six  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
  
Holdong a crucifix  
  
Deamon Dance  
  
They've all been part of this  
For thousands of years  
Granting the wizards wish  
  
Obey out of fear  
  
Unholy Rites  
Leave nothing to chance  
In the dead of night  
Do the deamons dance  
Seven million, four hundred  
  
Five thousand, nine  
Hundred and twenty-six  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
Holdong a crucifix  
Seven million, four hundred  
Five thousand, nine  
Hundred and twenty-six  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
Holdong a crucifix  
  
Deamon dance  
  
Deamon dance  
No, non, no  
Deamon dance  
  
Centuries ago  
Unholy sacrifice  
Rivers of blood did flow  
Deamons arise  
  
  
As the earth is turning  
There's no more romance  
As the souls are burning  
Deamons will dance  
  
Seven million, four hundred  
Five thousand, nine  
  
Hundred and twenty-six  
Deamons will do their dance  
Cannot escape  
Holdong a crucifix  
  
Deamon Dance  
  
No, no, no  
Deamon Dance  
Ah  
  

I always knew, somewhere in time  
We'd meet again, we'd cross that line  
Don't need to question, no reason why  
The answer lies before your eyes.  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you understand?  
  
Chorus:  
Deja vu, dreams come true  
I see my soul inside of you  
Deja vu, so many lives  
Familiar spirits behind your eyes.  
  
We cross between worlds through windows of light  
With open arms we hold back the night  
The crystal of power we hold in our hands  
We go on forever and love is the plan.  
  
Do you know who I am  
Do you understand?  
  
Repeat Chorus.

Don't ever try to fool me  
Cause I can see right through you  
It's in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
Hold me, feel me  
Wound and heal me  
Mend this broken heart  
Though you're near me  
You can't hear me  
But you tear my soul apart  
I can't beat you  
Can't defeat you  
You just make me cry inside  
Don't even try to fool me  
Cause I can see right through you  
It's in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
My rage is growing stronger  
And I can't wait no longer  
It's in your eyes  
You are the devil in disguise  
Never learning  
Vengeance is burning  
Deep inside your mind  
Time will come to  
When I'll make you  
Stumbling like blind leading the blind

In the darkness, they will gather  
Conjuring the one  
  
Burning candles, incantations  
Human sacrifice  
  
Getting drunk from blood, not wine  
Pointy daggers shine  
  
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone  
The dreaded one will rise  
  
Rise  
Burn  
Rise  
  
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell  
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell  
No one can stop what's already begun  
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son  
  
Victims of the grand illusion  
Screams of ecstasy  
Fools are lost in mass confusion  
Searching for the key  
  
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell  
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell  
No one can stop what's already begun  
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son  
  
Raise your cup and praise the prince of darkness  
See the truth of the power within the beast  
And when the time has come  
The gates of hell shall open  
  
Burning candles, incantations  
Human sacrifice  
  
Out of fire, smoke and brimstone  
The dreaded one will rise  
  
Nobody knows who's the disciples of hell  
Father's a priest and he's casting a spell  
No one can stop what's already begun  
Worshipping darkness and Lucifer's son

Don't make a move  
Don't make a sound  
I've got my eyes trained on you  
The target is found  
  
You waited too long  
Soon you'll be gone  
I'd rather stand on my own  
Ain't no more blanks left to fill  
In my list of sins  
I'm at the end of my rope  
  
The louder you speak  
The less I hear  
I gotta let off some steam  
and driven by fear  
  
Tell me I'm wrong  
'cause this can't go on  
I'd rather stand on my own  
Ain't no more blanks left to fill  
In my list of sins  
I'm at the end of my rope  
  
Leave me alone  
This can't go on  
Not anymore, no  
  
You waited too long  
Listen and soon you'll be gone  
Tell me I'm wrong  
'Cause this can't go on

Sinking my teeth  
into you  
Sweet obscenity  
You're in too deep  
for your own good  
  
I'm commanding thee  
Succumb to me  
set me free  
  
Facing the animal  
Walking the higher ground  
Lost in a ritual  
I close your eyes  
and kiss you twice  
  
Facing the Animal  
  
The scent of your skin  
Overpowers me  
there is no remedy  
It comes from within  
the divinity  
I just can't resist  
Must admit  
I'm losing it  
  
Facing the animal  
  
Facing the animal, yeah  
Lost in a ritual

Step inside the dream machine  
You're on a power drive  
Feel the passion of the beast  
Watch her come alive.  
  
Oh-- you're almost there, ride on silver air  
You better hold on tight-- she's fire in the night.  
  
Chorus:  
Faster than the speed of light  
Hugging all the curves  
Hang on to your life  
Faster than the speed of light  
Supercharged and flying low  
She's liquid dynamite.  
  
Got your hands upon the wheel  
The pedal to the floor  
Now it's time for nerves of steel  
Hear the engine roar.  
  
Oh-- you shoot the thrill-- heading for the kill  
No control tonight-- she's liquid dynamite.  
  
Repeat Chorus twice

Something deep inside, far from reality  
We pretend it never crossed our mind  
we feel but never sense  
Building up a strong defense  
Some say it's our destiny, Lord...  
We're living on the faultline  
Get out of here  
Cry the prophets of our time  
Fear the signs  
Save those you love and all your children  
You life depends on castles in the sand  
Don't look back there is no promised land  
We don't want to hear that this could be the day  
So much for science fiction  
as you always say  
But soon the day will come  
It's only just begun  
For the people on the faultline  
it's no use to pray  
Why living in danger  
We're living on the faultline  
Get out of here  
Cry the prophets of our time  
Fear the signs  
Save those you love and all your children  
You life depends on castles in the sand  
Don't look back there is no promised land  
We don't want to hear that this could be the day  
So much for science fiction  
as you always say  
But soon the day will come  
It's only just begun  
For the people on the faultline  
it's no use to pray  
Why living in danger  
Why living in danger, danger

What's left for me to see  
In my ship I sailed so far  
What can the answer be  
Don't know what the questions are.  
And after all I've done  
Still I cannot feel the sun  
Tell me save me  
In the end our lost souls must repent.  
I must know it is for certain  
Can it be the final curtain  
As long as the wind will blow  
I'll be searching high and low.  
Who knows what's really true  
They say the end is so near  
Why are we all so cruel  
We just fill ourselves with fear.  
And heaven and hell will turn  
All that we love shall burn  
Hear me trust me  
Inthe end our lost sould must repent.  
I must know it is for certain  
Can it be the final curtain  
As long as the wind will blow  
I'll be searching high and low  
Final curtain  
Final curtain

Born with the fire in my blood,  
Can't live without it.  
Something that gold can never buy.  
It doesn't matter who you are,  
Or what your thinking,  
If you believe in what you try.  
  
Feel the fire,  
Your burning desire.  
  
Fire, I'm burning up with fire  
Fire, feel it burning higher  
  
If you are rich, or if you are poor,  
There is no difference,  
It's still in what you're fighting for.  
If you are strong you will survive,  
You'll feel the fire,  
Burning on forever more.  
  
Feel the fire  
Your burning desire  
  
Fire, I'm burning up with desire  
You never play with fire.  
  
Fire, I'm burning up with desire  
You never play with fire.

Everyday is like a set up race  
And the world is still a lonely place  
To be or not to be is this the final quiz.  
A flash in the pan goodbye  
Still shooting for the open sky  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
I cannot find a compromise.  
It's all just treason  
They bring me down with their lies  
Don't know the reason  
My life is fire and ice.  
There's a voice that whispers I can fail  
I believe it's just a trick of the tail  
Between the devil and the deep blue sea  
There is no way no compromise.  
It's all just treason  
They bring me down with their lies  
Don't know the reason  
My life is fire and ice.

If you play with fire you'll get burned  
It's such a shame  
Even when you try you'll never learn  
To tame the flames  
  
Like the demon's eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
Some say I've been had, and that's too bad  
I know they're wrong  
Some say I've gone mad, and that's too sad  
I'm much too strong  
  
Like the demon's eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
You're not living what you're preaching and you're not a priest  
You're not living, you are leeching, living like a beast  
  
I feel fine although you give me hell  
I don't mind  
I'm your golden mine you know so well  
Let me shine  
  
Like the demon's eye  
Watching over me  
Relentlessly  
  
You have got no wings but you have always tried to fly  
Your soul is burning up like a fire in the sky  
You're not living what your preaching and you're not a priest  
You're not living, you are leeching, living like a beast

Today I read in a book that some are meant to live forever  
There's also a nightmare where our dying has no end  
If I let my will surrender and my flesh be crucified  
In his name my sins will be sublime  
Forever is a long long time  
It's said love is a gift that's given if we're true believers  
Just make your body and your soul his receivers  
In this world those golden rules  
May seem like they're made for fools  
Puppets on a string that blessing can bring  
Forever is a long long time  
Forever is a long long time  
But now the wine has turned sour after all these years of fighting  
So many wars but still his kingdom is not striking  
Pray for your enemy  
And love without agony  
Always ready for day to come  
Forever is a long long time  
Forever is a long time

Now it's so clear  
what i always feared  
to walk that lonely road  
without you  
and thou I'm afraid  
it's never too late  
now's the time to make our dreams come true  
eternal flame keeps burning on and on  
forever one  
I hear the angels calling out your name  
I felt so low  
as the days turned cold  
I know our love  
will conquer all  
you walked into my life  
I was born again  
now's the time to make our dreams come true  
forever one  
eternal flame keeps burning on and on  
forever one  
I hear the angels calling out your name  
forever one  
eternal flame keeps burning on and on.

Yeah  
You know what I'm talking about  
Yeah one more time  
Here we go  
Come on down  
Just let it loose  
Let's paint the town  
Now we sure have nothing to lose  
Feel the groove, wow  
In the night, feel the groove  
Come on baby, lets get it tight  
Alright  
Freedom isn't free  
No, no  
Get it tight, oh  
Alright  
You know what I'm talking about  
Come on, watch out  
Feel the heat  
Burning you up  
Feel the beat  
Everything is feeling alright  
Feel the groove  
In the night, feel the groove  
Come on baby let's get it right now  
Freedom isn't free  
No, no, ha  
Get it tight now  
Alright  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh no  
Alright, get it tight  
Can you feel the heat  
Is it burning you up  
We'll just go with the beat  
And then everything is  
Feeling alright now  
Oh no  
Here we go  
Oh yeah  
Come on down  
Just let it loose  
Let's paint the town  
Now we sure have nothing to lose  
Feel the groove,  
In the night, feel the groove  
Come on baby, lets get it tight  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh no  
Alright  
Get it tight  
Get it tight, oh no  
Alright  
Get it tight  
No, no  
Yeah  
You know what I'm talking about now  
You've got it  
Okay  
  

I now will tell you all a story  
That no one ever heard before  
It is the tale about the fury  
Remember wisdom is your strength  
  
It said you're such a fool  
Just let my evil rule  
  
No, it's burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
I've lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
It's wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury, no!  
  
At first it came to me in visions  
And that was filling me with pain  
And when my fear became desire  
To let the demon burn my soul  
  
It said "Don't fight in vain,"  
"I'll make you love the pain."  
  
No, it's burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
I've lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
It's wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury, no!  
  
I now have told you all my story  
And still for you its not too late  
Don't draw your sword  
Just use your wisdom  
And never let this be your fate  
  
Oh, no it's here again  
This demon loves the pain  
  
No, it's burning like a flame  
Now nothing seems the same  
I've lost control of mind and body  
My soul is in its hand  
It's wish is my command  
Enslaved forever by the fury  
By the fury, no!

Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The Gates to Babylon  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
Oh Gates of Babylon  
  
You can see but you're blind  
Someone turned the sun around  
But you can see in your mind  
The Gates of Babylon  
You're riding the endless caravan  
Bonded and sold as a slave  
A saber dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave  
A saber dance removing all the veils  
Getting as good as you gave  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
  
Look away from the sea  
I can take you anywhere  
Spend a vision with me  
A chase with the wind  
  
Move closer to me  
I can make you anyone  
I think you're ready to see  
The Gates of Babylon  
The power of what has been before  
Rises to trap you within  
A magic carpet ride a genie maybe more  
A city of heavenly sin  
Sleep with the devil and then you must pay  
Sleep with the devil, the devil will take you away  
Black Gates of Babylon  
The devil is me  
And I'm holding the key  
To the gates of sweet hell  
Babylon

I told you once and  
I told you twice  
you will fall and  
I will rise  
tell me now who's fooling who  
one of us must surely die  
it isn't me, it must be you  
you're my holy sacrifice  
hairtrigger-telling you no lies  
hairtrigger-time to say goodbye  
you will cry and  
you will pray  
there's no escape  
it's judgement day!  
deep inside you know too well  
in my hands i hold your fate  
in the end we'll meet in hell  
you're my holy sacrifice  
hairtrigger-now the time has come  
hairtrigger-nowhere left to run  
hairtrigger.

Beams of light up in the sky  
Malfunctioned machinery, lost in time  
Don't understand, I'm wondering why  
How can this happen its so out of line  
Strangers among us  
From beyond the stars  
Whatever you know keep your silence  
Unearthly ones from galaxies afar  
There will be violence  
  
They know something  
That we don't know  
What cannot be seen they'll never show  
Hangar eighteen, Area fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
For me to recall, they hypnotize  
It's all part of investigations  
They say that I just fantasize  
Just try to explain mutilations  
  
They know something  
That we don't know  
What cannot be seen they'll never show  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
We're victims of grand illusion  
Now we're lost in mass confusion  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
Hangar eighteen  
  
They know something  
That we don't know  
What cannot be seen they'll never show  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
We're victims of grand illusion  
Now we're lost in mass confusion  
Hangar eighteen,Area fifty one  
  
Hangar eighteen

Dress in Armour  
Bring your sword and shield  
And your lucky charm.  
In dragonships  
We'll sail the seven seas  
Under guilding stars.  
  
Into battle, we will ride  
Gods will follow, by our side  
  
[Bridge: x1]  
Heathens from the north  
  
The air is still,  
The bodies cold and pale  
They'll never live to tell.  
About the slaughter  
When battlegrounds ran red  
We gave them hell.  
  
Into battle, sense of pride  
We're forever, shining bright  
  
[Bridge x4]  
Heathens from the north  
  
We are immortal  
Ever shining bright  
Heathens from the north, yeah

Lost in a dream in the arms of the night  
Two lonely prisoners of our own device  
Don't let me go. Hold on together  
You want to know if love can be real  
I want to take everything I can steal  
Love on the line, it's now or never.  
Why can't the night last forever.  
  
This could be Paradise  
Holding you here by my side  
If we just close our eyes  
We'll be in Heaven tonight.  
  
Run through the night down streets of desire  
Burning my soul, my heart's on fire  
Give up the fight, it's sweet surrender  
With trembling hands we reach for it all  
Two desperate hearts waiting to fall  
I need you now, now more than ever.  
  
Why can't the night last forever.  
  
This could be Paradise  
Holding you here by my side  
If we just close our eyes  
We'll be in Heaven tonight.  
  
This feels like Paradise  
I see the world in our eyes  
If we just hold on tight  
We'll be in Heaven tonight.

In this wasteland without any shadows  
There is no water for my dusty throat  
There is no rainbow days filled with silent sorrow  
And for our sins there are no antidotes.  
Eternal sand  
There is no end to his no man's land  
We all must pay  
For the piper we dance while he plays  
How many miles to Babylon  
How many years must I carry on.  
In this our endless searching for the Holy Grail  
There is no sleep for the souls who find no rest  
Ships of the desert without rigs or sails  
Flotsam and Jetsam floating from the west  
Eternal sand  
There is no end to his no man's land  
We all must pay  
For the piper we dance while he plays  
How many miles to Babylon  
How many years must I carry on

I am a Viking in going out to war  
And I've got death upon my mind  
As I was leavin' oh yesterday  
I've got no fear in my heart  
  
As the shores of my home disappear  
I sail over the sea without fear  
Dragon ships are charging through the waves  
Just want to sail away into the sea yeah yeah  
  
I am a warrior my mind is set to kill  
Life or death is on the line  
I am a slayer and you will taste my steel  
I've got your life right in my hand  
  
As the shores of my home disappear  
I sail over the sea without fear  
Dragon ships are charging through the waves  
Just want to sail away into the sea yeah yeah  
  
You are a loser and it's such a shame  
That you're a fool and you don't know  
That in a viking I'll walk all over you  
And by my sword you will die  
  
As the shores of my home disappear  
I sail over the sea without fear  
Dragon ships are charging through the waves  
Just want to sail away into the sea yeah yeah

On and on  
My world keeps spinnin' round and round  
I am so lost since you've gone away  
[Chorus 1:]  
Day after day I've been tryin'  
To find a way to make you see  
[Chorus 2:]  
I - hate to wonder  
Why - you don't realize  
I - feel like I could die  
Just hold me one more time  
I can't wait - not for a lifetime  
I can't wait - I've been holding on  
I can't wait - Tell me what to do  
I'll wait for you  
Ooh, it's been so long  
I won't last another day  
[Chorus 1  
  

Living in a big world,  
that ain't too kind to me.  
lookin' for some changes  
that no one wants to see  
running round in circles  
nowhere left to go  
too many uniforms  
tryin' to run this show  
I don't know  
it's never what i wanted  
living in this heap  
got to get the hell out  
I'm in too fuckin' deep  
this world is a crazy place  
I'll take it day by day  
lord, won't you help me  
I got to get away  
I don't know.

I'd sacrifice, whatever's left of me  
Been livin' lies then you set me free  
You've given more than I ever had  
I give to you all over again  
  
We've grown so strong  
Over and over again  
Though things have gone wrong  
My love  
  
There is no higher love than we have  
You know I'd die without you  
There are no lies, we left them behind  
I'd surely die without you  
  
I've never tried, tried this hard  
I've never cried, never gone so far  
Even the Gods, can't set us apart  
It's engraved deep in our hearts  
  
We've grown so strong  
Over and over again  
Though things have gone wrong  
My love  
  
There is no higher love than we have  
You know I'd die without you  
There are no lies, we left them behind  
I'd surely die without you

I've seen visions in the night, passing through the stars  
Who's to run and who's to fight?  
  
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die  
Who's to lose and who's to win  
  
I'll see the light, tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life, tonight  
  
Now, the chaos has begun, people crying out  
You're all alone, you gotta run  
  
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide  
No, we never had a chance  
  
I'll see the light, tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life, tonight  
  
Evil tries to pull me in, enslaving me to die  
Who's to lose and who's to win  
  
Victims of circumstance, not able to decide  
No, we never had a chance  
  
I'll see the light, tonight  
Flashing through the sky  
Take my life, tonight

From now on I'm dancing with myself  
To the sound of a blue and broken string  
Left behind with the dust upon a shelf  
The remains of a long forgotten song.  
All that we had but now again  
I stand alone all love has an end.  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you.  
From now on I'm sleeping with my shadow  
In the night my thoughts can be my own  
All the pain and all this endless sorrow  
I miss you more than I will ever know.  
Holding you never again  
It cannot be all love has an end.  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you.  
Now I know there is no-one that is waiting  
At the end of that long and winding road  
Memories in the dead of night are calling  
All the way I carry on my heavy load.  
All that we had but now again  
I stand alone all love has an end.  
You cannot see this is my destiny  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you  
You cannot see this is my reality  
I'm my own enemy  
In my life there was no-one like you.

Are you one of mine who can sleep with one eye open wide?  
Agonizing psychotic solitary hours to decide  
Reaching for the light at the slightest noise from the floor  
Palms of hands perspire heart goes leaping at a knock from the door.  
In the Dead of Night  
In the Dead of Night  
Rich and powerful ascend complicated bends to be free  
To indulge in what they will and jaded thrill or fanstasy  
Shuttered windows that belie all stifled cries from within  
And prying eyes are blind to proceedings of the kind that begin  
In the Dead of Night  
In the Dead of Night

I can't believe you're even trying this  
And the fact that you don't know what my power is  
On the battle field all the angels will fall  
And you can't hide behind your crumbling walls  
Evil dreams they try to pull you in  
But now's the time to pay for all your sins  
When it's even way too late to repent  
So maybe your death is just heaven sent  
No shackles can hold me down  
You can never understand  
You'll never take my crown  
And all the power in my hands  
Forever I shall stay this way  
And you'll never take what's mine away  
I just love when vengeance tastes so sweet  
I just love when you must taste defeat  
Now you know you must die by my blade  
Soon enough your soul will fade away  
It makes me laugh you even took your turn  
You can't be serious, won't you ever learn  
I'm the man that you can never take out  
You've must forgotten what it's all about  
Threw caution to the wind  
Are you really all that blind  
Committing ancient sins  
Are you really that behind  
We all have a cross to bear  
You can seek but never find  
Can't you feel the sadness there  
Did you loose your mind  
Now it seems that way to me  
Did you commit those crimes  
Open up your eyes and see  
Are you relly all so blind  
No wonder you were left behind again  
No shackles can hold me down  
You can never understand  
You'll never take my crown  
And all the power in my hands  
Forever I shall stay this way  
And you'll never take what's mine away  
Did you loose your mind  
Now it seems that way to me  
Did you commit those crimes  
Open up your eyes and to see  
Are you really all so blind  
Will it ever set me free  
No wonder you w  
  

I cast my pearls before the swine  
Sealed and delivered  
Then I drink your toast of wine  
Though it's bitter sweet  
I'm eating from you hand so neat  
Pennies from heaven  
You say you give  
You say you love  
But yet you live  
Judas...Judas  
Sightseeing through the lights  
and shades of you mighty colonnades  
No I got the picture  
of the beauty and the beast  
I am the lamb...you are the priest  
To crucify me  
You say you give  
You say you love  
But yet you live  
Judas...Judas  
To make a living...Makes no difference  
You are what you do  
Some are false and some are true  
You haven't got a clue  
I'd rather reign in hell some said  
Than serve in heaven  
You say you give  
You say you love  
But yet you live  
Judas...Judas

Ab antiquo  
Ab integro  
Audi vide  
Tace si vis vivere in pace  
  
Why cannot man also fly  
We're chained down to the earth  
Not like birds in the sky  
Soaring from birth  
Devices of destruction, Devices of death  
Find out their construction  
Give them life, give them breath  
  
Which God may I thank  
Making art from a canvas blank  
Paintings from the holy book  
Depicting Christ and the chance he took  
Oh, tell me  
  
When will you ever learn  
the true depths of my work  
Future is my concern  
You know art is my church  
  
Gaze inside the quest of man  
And find a new machine  
I learn everything I can  
Dig it up, cut it clean  
Always tried my very best  
To find what lies within  
Put myself to the test  
Judge me not, it's not a sin  
  
Which God may I thank  
Making art from a canvas blank  
Paintings from the holy book  
Depicting Christ and the chance he took  
Oh, tell me  
  
When will you ever learn  
the true depths of my work  
Future is my concern  
You know art is my church  
When I'm dead and I'm gone  
Will you remember me?  
I've seen beyond the sun  
Reinventing machines  
  
Ab antiquo  
Ab integro  
Audi vide  
Tace si vis vivere in pace

I'm casting pearls before the swine.  
I think I must be losing my mind.  
You tried to leave me high and dry.  
Yes you nearly left me to die.  
Sticks and stones may break my bones.  
But your words, they never hit home.  
Time to say good-bye to all the pain.  
And chase away the rain.  
Now there is wind in my sails.  
And I cannot fail.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.  
I'm a soldier and I will fight.  
On through the darkness and into the light.  
Now the ace is up my sleeve.  
It's so good it's hard to believe.  
I will take the journey to the end.  
Until there is nothing left for you to defend.  
Now the tables are being turned.  
And it's time for you to burn.  
Now there is wind in my sails.  
And I cannot fail.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.  
[guitar solo]  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll.  
Let the good times roll  
  
  

You came to me  
You said you were my friend  
I shared my art and my mind.  
You found it easier  
To steal than create.  
Then call it your's, though it's mine  
  
You can't fight, what is right  
Face the truth, liar  
You can't feel, you just steal  
Face the truth, liar  
  
You smile in my face,  
When I turn around,  
You stick a knife in my back.  
You think you're clever,  
You know you're insane,  
You're lies are not white they are black.  
  
You can't fight, what is right  
Face the truth, liar  
You can't feel, you just steal  
Face the truth, liar

Everyone is searching for the  
Meaning of our life.  
Reading 'bout the hell and heaven  
Believing all those lies.  
  
Look upon yourself  
Imagine you are two  
Power lies within this is true.  
  
Can't you see its clear like a mirror  
It's all within what you're searching for  
  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
  
Now your eyes are open,  
and you know you were a fool.  
You always had the power,  
But you never broke the rules.  
  
Look upon yourself  
Imagine you are two  
Power lies within this is true  
  
Can't you see its clear like a mirror  
It's all within what you're searching for  
  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
Magic mirror, magic mirror  
  
Once again I say,  
The strength that we are all searching for,  
High and low we all looked in vain  
Can't you see, it's clear like a mirror.  
It's all within what you're searching for.  
  
Magic mirror, Magic mirror  
Magic mirror, Magic mirror

I've been searching  
all my life  
I've been hurting  
living lies  
in the dark  
trying to find true love  
in my heart  
no time to lose, goodbye to blues  
why can't you see  
we were meant to be  
we're walking through fire  
we're stronger than steel  
we've joined our souls  
now we're free  
we've reached our souls  
we finally see  
yesterday we lived in sorrow  
we live today for tomorrow  
no time to lose, goodbye to blues  
why can't you see  
we were meant to be  
we're walking through fire  
we're stronger than steel.

For eons they reigned  
with blood, with pain  
our souls devoured  
in a temple of power  
stone by stone  
life by life sacrifice  
with the whips and the chains  
they will build  
no matter what  
pay the price  
with our flesh and bone  
soon reaching the sky  
but many must die  
this temple will bring  
eternal life for the king  
stone by stone  
life by life sacrifice  
with the whips and the chains  
they will build  
no matter what  
pay the price  
with our flesh and bone.

They all were there, the court was full  
The king beside his queen  
His love was cold, the fool will dance  
for her 'till end of time,  
  
The queen is in love,  
The queen is in love.  
  
She couldn't help her burning heart,  
And now he's burning too.  
Their love was blind,  
They will dance until the end of time.  
  
Queen is in love  
Queen is in love  
  
The furious king now has learned  
He sentenced them to burn.  
Forever one,  
They are joined in death eternally  
  
Queen is in love  
Queen is in love

You're a being of the darkest descend  
You don't belong anywhere  
You're always hungry, but never content  
All of your sins, you could never bear  
Now you're feeling good  
But you're really dead  
And you're wearing make up and perfume  
In the gallows you were hung  
But now I see you walk instead  
Razor eater  
He'll never ever die  
Razor eater  
He'll never ever die  
Well you kept your secrets  
And locked them up  
Then drained their blood  
As you read your books  
See the show and rink from your cup  
And then hang your darlings  
From the hooks  
Slice them up, no one will ever know  
But still you smell that smell  
And now you're dead since long ago  
You better burn in hell  
Razor eater  
He will never die  
Razor eater  
He will never die  
Razor eater  
Razor eater  
Razor eater  
  

Now the end begins  
World is dying from within  
Game is still the same  
Different players  
Fuel the flames  
  
Now is the time to shed our skin  
And we must repent our sins  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
Brewing much too long  
New age dawns  
It's a phenomenon  
Calm before the storm  
Our spirits must be free to roam  
  
Out of chaos we will rise  
No time for compromise, no!  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
In this relentless quest  
There's no time to lose  
We must pass the test  
We will wield this power  
To win this battle  
In our finest hour  
  
Then your death will be glorious  
As we stand victorious  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
  
Revolution  
Revolution  
Revolution  
Revolution

Locked up in chains, backs to the wall  
Tick like a time bomb till we hear the call  
Pushed from outside, thrown underground  
Frozen in time we wait for the sound.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I feel something coming  
Looks like a riot in the dungeon.  
  
Trapped behind bars, prisoners of death  
All hope is ours, we can't give up yet  
Ready to fight to get what we need  
Die on your feet or live on your knees.  
  
Chorus:  
Oh, I feel something coming  
Looks like a riot in the dungeon  
You stand and die or start your running  
'Cause there's a riot in the dungeon.  
  
It's got to give, it's gonna break  
Dying to live, our freedom's at stake  
Beating the odds with our hearts and blood  
We won't give in till they've had enough.

You know I have seen the dark side  
But evil is not my friend  
And you know I'll die trying  
Keep on trying to the end  
You know I'm superstitious  
But the devil never pays  
My victory is delicious  
When you fall, fall from grace  
My holy sacrifice  
It's time for me to rise  
The demons chained me down  
It's time to rise  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise  
Rise up  
I have had my share of fighting  
But I still could fight some more  
Now I can see the horizon  
Much better than before  
What I've been giving all these years  
My blood, my sweat, my tears  
I'll carry on forever  
My holy sacrifice  
It's time for me to rise  
The demons chained me down  
It's time to rise  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise up  
My holy sacrifice  
It's time for me to rise  
The demons chained me down  
What I've been giving all these years  
My blood, my sweat, my tears  
I'll carry on forever  
It's time to rise  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise up  
Rise  
  

Can't bow for a rule  
Cause I'm nobody's fool  
No puppet on a string when what counts is to win  
Sometimes I might be rude  
Acting in my mood  
I'm trying to be straight  
Cause I don't want to be late  
There's nothing you can say to make  
Me feel worse than I do (how are you)  
You can't buy my freedom  
Keep me locked in your cell  
Sad how we waste our energy  
When all our days are few (makes me blue)  
We're two of a kind me and you  
I guess that I'll see you in hell  
Who is my friend  
Who will remain  
Seems like I always stand alone in the end  
Nobody lasts until the end  
There's nothing you can say to make  
Me feel worse than I do (how are you)  
You can't buy my freedom  
Keep me locked in your cell  
Sad how we waste our energy  
When all our days are few (makes me blue)  
You can't buy my life and freedom  
It's more than just buy and sell  
You can't keep me locked in your cell  
I guess that I'll see you in hell  
See you in hell  

Now the battle is over, the clouds're hanging low  
Dead bodies lie on the ground  
Marched into slaughter, lost souls fought in vain  
No glory or pride to be found  
  
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around  
Trying to find my way home  
  
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around  
Trying to find my way home  
  
Fighting for honour and medals of gold  
But, they were to kill or be killed  
Slaying the enemy, not knowing why  
Keep low and fire at will  
  
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around  
Trying to find my way home  
  
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around  
Trying to find my way home  
  
Lost out in action, long gone forever  
Just a boy that died in vain  
His mother is crying, his father not proud  
Twisted gray faces in the rain  
  
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around  
Trying to find my way home  
  
Gotta get out of here, don't want to be around  
Trying to find my way home

Its NOT very far away  
It takes about half a day  
To get there  
If we travel by my, dragonfly  
No its not in spain  
But all the same (haha)  
You know  
Its the name  
And the winds just, riggghhtt  
hang on my darlin'  
Hang on TO ME if you wanna go  
Your love puts its all right on the shelf  
When you gimme that Spanish Castle Magic  
Some spanish castle magic  
when the clouds are really low  
And they overflow LIKE cotton candy  
And battlegrounds  
Red and Brown  
But its all in your mind  
Don't waste your time  
On little things like  
Heyyy  
Hey, Hey, Hey  
hang on my darlin'  
Hang on TO ME if you wanna go  
Your love puts its all right on the shelf  
When you gimme some Spanish Castle Magic  
Ooohh spanish castle magic  

Alright  
Alright  
You sacrificed  
And worked all your life  
But now you're  
Bleeding, crying all for nothing  
Nothing  
You waiting for that day  
And you're always praying  
For the gates  
To finally open, open  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
Yeah  
Well you can bring  
And army's might  
But I will always fight  
Until the end, the end  
You can never break  
Through my walls  
And I'll never fall  
What's mine I will defend  
Defend  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
And I will show you  
No mercy  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
Yeah  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my  
Stronghold  
Well don't believe  
What you have heard  
Just don't believe  
A single word  
Not a word  
Into my stronghold  
You will never take my stronghold  
Yeah, Never, no  
  

Getting dressed for the masquerade  
To be the main attraction  
Might become someone someday  
With the right connection  
You might find the night so lonely  
But you're not the only one  
I just want to go with ecstasy  
To the river of love I run  
Teaser you set my heart on fire  
Teaser put out the flames of my desire  
If you let me stay inside  
I give satisfaction  
In the night we might lose our way  
In the tunnel of love I ride  
Teaser you set my heart on fire  
Teaser put out the flames of my desire  
Ohh I guess we all need someone  
Teaser you set my heart on fire  
Teaser put out the flames of my desire

Late at night I like to hide.  
I dwell inside the shadows.  
But I wasn't always this alive.  
Since you hung me from the gallows.  
You know I love the night.  
And I love the darkness.  
As I cruise along the highway.  
Now there is no more light.  
And there is no more sweetness.  
I will always have it my way.  
Well, I am the ghost inside your head.  
And I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
Don't you cry for those who bled.  
Cause I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
I am the bogeyman.  
Well don't believe in what you see.  
And don't believe in what you hear.  
Don't you worry, it's only me.  
And I am the sum of all your fears.  
Well, I am the ghost inside your head.  
And I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
Don't you cry for those who bled.  
Cause I will rock your world from dusk to dawn.  
I am the bogeyman, And I'm no holyman.  
I am the bogeyman.  
I am the bogeyman.  
[guitar solo]  
I am the bogeyman.  
I am the bogeyman.  
And I'm no holyman.  
I am the bogeyman  
  
  

Oh, it feels like, it was yesterday  
When you came into my life  
And took my heart away  
Now I find, myself looking back  
And I'm realizing how  
You turned me inside out  
And left with no doubt  
  
Oh you're the only one  
The love I feel  
And you're the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
Now I see what it's all about  
No more chasin' my own tail  
There's nothing left to fear  
As long as you are here  
  
Oh you're the only one  
The love I feel  
And you're the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
Oh you're the only one I know  
The love I feel  
And you're the only one  
It seems unreal  
  
I can't explain the way I feel  
I've waited so long  
For someone like you

Dark night, there is no light  
In the realm of the black magic man  
Soul's flight into the cold blight  
Of the destroyer's magic land  
Poor man, whose spirits are stronger  
They're a little too weary  
You're starting to...  
  
Blind man, you're suckin' your own blood  
Soon black magic's dying  
You'd better start crying  
Blind man, you're suckin' your own blood  
Soon black magic's dying  
You'd better start crying  
  
Throw out your evil desire  
The dark king's kingdom is  
Made out of mire  
  
Throw out your evil desire  
The dark king's kingdom is  
Made out of mire  
  
Keep on for the kingdom of light  
There is no darkness, there is no night

It all began with an experiment that failed  
Meant for the enemy, unleashed on us  
Everything that was on course has been derailed  
We're all caught in the rush  
Holding the poison within  
This battle no one wins  
No  
  
Stand  
The Stand  
  
Plague came down on us like a ton of bricks  
Generals spilled their bag of tricks  
Like an avalanche roaring over you  
Now there is nothing left to do  
No one left to burn  
Captain Trips has taken all  
  
No  
Stand  
The Stand  
Try to understand  
The Stand  
  
Stand  
The Stand  
Try to understand  
The Stand

Crusade after crusade  
Defending the faith and the holy light  
I come to your aid  
Fear not my fair maiden, fear not  
I'm set to attack  
No demons or dragons  
Will hold me back  
There's strength in my sword  
Fall into my arms and I'll take you back  
  
When the cold wind starts to blow  
Into battle I shall go  
Any tower I will climb  
I can fight you folded blind  
  
I would die for my king and my land  
But I must die  
With my sword in my hand  
Raise my cup in honor of the Lord  
Gives the power I need  
To wield my sword  
  
So much stronger than you  
No power, no God cannot heed you  
You're my sacrifice  
You know in the end  
You must pay the price  
You are my Prey  
I am the slayer, the predator  
You'll never grow old  
No armor or sword will save your soul  
  
Clash of lance, clash of shield  
In the end you must yield  
You're a ghost inside my head  
I will see you good and dead  
  
I would die for my king and my land  
But I must die  
With my sword in my hand  
Raise my cup in honor of the lord  
Gives the power I need  
To wield my sword
