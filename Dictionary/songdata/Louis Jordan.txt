Got caught with a dozen eggs

Kill the chicken with the bandy leg  
Bow wow, bow wow,  
Miaow, miaow  
"Cluck cluck cluck cluck" said the little red hen  
"Let's boogie in the barnyard."  
Peep peep, quack quack,  
Cluck cluck, moo moo,

Doug the jitterbug,  
Just a silly lug,  
Young and wild with lots of style,  
That's Doug the jitterbug!  
  
Just a crazy mug,  
Drinks liquor by the jug,  
He's alive with lots of jive,  
Doug the jitterbug!  
  
They threw him out of school  
'Cause all he learned was Tiger Rag,  
He never knew the golden rule,  
But boy, how he can shag!  
  
Doug the jitterbug,  
Cuts a wicked rug,  
It ain't no shame, he's not to blame,  
He's Doug the jitterbug!  
  
He studied to be a lawyer,  
But he never got a case,  
Every time they'd look for that cat in court  
He'd be doing the pantywaist!  
  
Let's talk about Doug the jitterbug,  
Cuts a wicked rug,  
It ain't no shame, he's not to blame,  
He's Doug the jitterbug!

Early in the morning and I can't get right  
Had a little date with my baby last night  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

I went to our house but she don't live there no more  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning

I knocked on her mother's door and she began to shout  
"Get away, mad boy"  
  
Yes, early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues  
  
I went to [Incomprehensible] to get something to eat  
The waitress looked at me and said  
"Pops, you sure look beat"  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning

Couldn't find my baby, now my money's run out  
  
Now it's early in the morning  
Ooh, in the morning  
Early in the morning  
And I ain't got nothing but the blues

Come back to me, baby

'Fore day in the mornin', babe,  
You ain't got home yet.  
Hmm, it's 'fore day in the mornin', babe,  
You ain't got home yet.  
I cried and cried  
'Til my pillow's soaking wet!  
Babe, I can't get started  
Since you threw me down,  
Hmmm, I can't get started  
Since you threw me down,  
I thought you were the square, babe,  
And you played me for a clown.  
I loved you, baby,  
But you don't mean me no good.  
Hmmm, I loved you, baby,  
But you don't mean me no good.  
You give me so much trouble  
I believe I move from your neighborhood!

Outta your seat  
Into the street  
Make with the feet  
Reet

Is to salute to L-I-E-you-T  
But if you brush the L-I-E-you-T  
The M-P makes you K-P on the Q-T  
This is the G. I. Jive  
Man alive  
They give you a private tank that features a little device called "fluid
drive"  
Jack, after you revive  
Chuck all your junk  
Back in the trunk  
Fall on your bunk  
Clunk

Let the good times roll, let the good times roll  
I don't care if you're young or old  
Get together, let the good times roll  
  
Don't sit there mumblin', talkin' trash  
If you wanna have a ball  
You gotta go out and spend some cash, and  
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll  
I don't care if you're young or old  
Get together, let the good times roll  
  
Hey Mr. Landlord, lock up all the doors  
When the police comes around  
Just tell 'em that the joint is closed  
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll  
I don't care if you're young or old  
Get together, let the good times roll  
  
Hey tell everybody  
Mr. King's in town  
I got a dollar and a quarter  
Just rarin' to clown  
But don't let nobody play me cheap  
I got fifty cents more that I'm gonna keep, so  
  
Let the good times roll, let the good times roll  
I don't care if you're young or old  
Get together, let the good times roll  
  
No matter whether rainy weather  
Birds of a feather gotta stick together  
So get yourself under control  
Go out and get together and let the good times roll

Life is so peculiar  
You get so wet in the rain, you know I do  
You get so warm in the sunshine, get my sun tan  
It doesn't pay to complain, I never complain  
  
When I get up each morning  
There's nothing to breathe but air, yeah  
And when I look in the mirror  
There's nothing to comb but hair  
  
And when I sit down to breakfast  
There's nothing to eat but food  
Life is so peculiar  
But you can't stay home and brood  
  
Oh, life, tell 'em about it pops, is so peculiar  
The desert's only got sand, and that's grand  
The oceans only got water, and you can't drink it all up  
And you never know where you stand  
  
When I get out to dinner  
There's nothing to wear but clothes, yeah  
And whenever I get sleepy  
There's nothing to do but doze, yeah  
  
And whenever I get thirsty  
There's nothing to do but drink  
Life is no peculiar  
That it makes you stop and think  
  
Yes, life is so peculiar, sure it is  
A fork belongs with the knife, it sure does  
Corn beef is lost without cabbage, I love cabbage  
Husband should have a wife  
  
Yes, life is so peculiar  
But as everybody says  
That's life  
  
Life, yes life, it's so peculiar  
A bird can usually sing, no words, I do too  
A pearl is made by an oyster, New Orleans? Rampart Street  
You can't be sure of a thing  
  
When I get tired of restin'  
There's nothing to do but walk, walk it off pop  
And when I don't care to listen  
There's nothing to do but talk, keep you big mouth shut  
  
When I'm up in the airplane  
There's nothing to do but fly  
Life is so peculiar  
But I often wonder why  
  
Oh, life, is so peculiar, sure it is  
A fork belongs with a knife, you know  
Corn beef is lost without cabbage, leftover cabbage? Yeah  
A husband should have a wife  
  
Yes, life is so peculiar  
But as everybody says  
That's life  
  
One more for me Jim, that's life  
Let me hear it one time, that's life  
All together, that's life, yeah!

Mop mop! A thousand years ago  
Mop mop! A guy named Jungle Joe  
Was a drummer man in a Zulu band  
That made swing history  
  
Mop mop! One day the king said "Gate!  
Why Gate, you old reprobate  
I commission you, find a riff that's new  
Or your wig belongs to me."  
  
Joe's knees started knockin'  
So scared he was stiff  
'Til he noticed the tribe was rockin'  
As his knees beat out this mellow riff  
  
Mop mop! From the tropic's heat  
Mop mop! Came this jungle beat  
Though old Joe is gone, his jive lives on  
And it still is making history.

I went out to get some groceries the other day  
From my neighborhood grocery store  
And before I could open my mouth  
The grocery man said "No! You can't get that no more"  
That's what he said, you can't get that no more  
He said, "I sold all I had the other day  
It ain't me Mr. Jordan, it's the OPA  
You just can't get it, you got to do with what you got  
Ain't go have no more for the duration,  
You got to be careful with your boots on"  
  
The hip cats used to stand on the corner in their zoot suits  
And them long chains hanging down all looking cute,  
But things is very different now since Uncle Sam has got some Japs to shoot  
  
You can't do that no more  
You can't do that no more  
No more standing on the corner day and night  
Cause Uncle Sam says you got to work or you got to fight  
So you can't do that no more  
No you can't do that no more  
  
You know the glamour gals stopped glamorizing  
They working in defense plants wearing slacks  
And some of them fine chicks is cutting out everyday  
Joining the wave, the spas and the wax  
Now fellas, you can't get that no more  
I am telling you fellas, you just can't get it  
You can't jive these girls like you used to do  
Cause some of them is making more money than you  
I am telling you boys, you just can't get that no more  
No you can't get that no more  
  
You know the girls used to wake up every morning  
And say lord send me a handsome man  
One that is physically fit  
But uncle sam has got all of them now  
And the gals is got to take just what they can get  
  
You can't get that no more  
Aint no need to be giggling girls  
You just can't get it no more that's all  
Girls you can't be particular  
You've got to take what's left  
Either them worn out 3A's or them beat up 4F's  
That's all you just can't get it no more  
No you can't get that no more

You catch me beatin' up your chops?  
I ought to turn you over to the cops,  
But dig this spiel I'm going to lay on you, gate,  
Don't cop your broom, park the body and wait.  
  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You tell everybody I'm busted,  
You talk so much you got me disgusted.  
But you run your mouth and I'll run my business,  
Brother.  
  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother,  
You start in tellin' me you're my pal,  
And end up tellin' me how to handle my gal,  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother.  
  
You run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business,  
Brother,  
Just run your juicy mouth and I'll run my business,  
Brother,  
You always tellin' me what to do,  
Sayin', "I wouldn't do that if I was you!"  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother.  
  
Just clap your liver lips and I'll run my business,  
Brother,  
Clap your liver lips and I'll run my business, brother,  
If I'd followed your advice on how to make dough,  
I'd been in the jailhouse long ago.  
You run your mouth and I'll run my business, brother.  
  
Do you dig me, Jack?
