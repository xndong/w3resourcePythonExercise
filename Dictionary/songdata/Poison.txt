Now pardon my personal demons, child but if you do insist  
Sit down and listen to me story awhile, cause it goes something like this  
  
The joint was small but we were having a ball  
At a place called the Blue Duck Inn  
When I couldn't help but notice her  
My future wife walked in  
  
I needed me a dose of her, so I got a little closer  
And this is what she said  
My old man stands about six foot five  
And if he catches you, you're dead  
  
Now I don't need none of that  
giving me the blues  
The old man sitting next to me said  
Son, let me tell you  
  
[Chorus]  
Life, you just can't fake it  
Love, you gotta make it  
Time, you better take it  
Lord, ain't that the truth  
Hear me out  
Your heart will surely feel it  
Women come and steal it  
Time can only heal it  
Lord, ain't that the truth  
  
I save Friday night for the ladies  
Saturday night for my gin  
Come Sunday morning, I'm asking the good Lord  
To forgive me for my sins  
  
Lately my heave-ho get-up-and-go  
Wouldn't get me out of bed  
I felt like some big wrecking ball  
Done hit upside my head  
  
Now I don't need a preacher man  
Telling me how to run my life  
Until an angel sitting next to me  
said son, heed my advice. She said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You better get your story straight  
What comes around goes around  
  
[Chorus]

I can't say I ain't been around  
That I ain't done my time  
Seems like this big old world  
Has been one big shoe to shine  
  
But I never ever took a dime  
For what comes naturally  
And if I never knew the truth  
Well she'd be fine with me  
  
One night she stayed over here  
And left her little black book behind  
Well that little black book ain't little no more  
And it wasn't too hard too find  
  
Chorus:  
She'd leave me in this lonely room  
The thought just made me sick  
It's funny how the pieces fit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Yeah, my baby gets around a bit  
  
Her pager would ring, it's a funny thing  
She'd have to go right away  
She always had a wad of cash  
Much more than her job could pay  
  
I'd ask her where she's going to  
And this is what she'd say  
"i gotta meet someone for an interview  
He's only in town today"  
  
Always a little bit overdressed  
Much more than I thought he'd be  
High heel shoes and day glow dress  
Ain't seem strange to me  
  
She'd leave me in this lonely room  
While some stud got his sex  
Just then the thought occurred to me  
My baby gets around a bit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Oooh, my baby gets around a bit...  
  
Solo  
  
Took her to the local bar  
Where I like to hang  
Every guy that passed her by  
They all seemed to know her name  
  
They all called her by a different name  
And one of them winked at me  
Some guy named stan said "you're the man  
I heard you get it for free"  
  
She'd leave me in this lonely room  
And the thought hit me like a brick  
It's funny how the pieces fit  
My baby gets around a bit  
Ooooh, my baby gets around a bit  
Ooooh, my baby gets around a bit  
My baby gets around a bit  
  
My baby gets around....  
My baby..

Like this  
All the king's horses  
And all the king's men  
Ain't got a hope in hell  
Of puttin' my pieces back together again  
  
I've seen things in my life that should never be seen  
I'm talkin' things that'd make your skin crawl  
I want to go back to a simpler time  
Where nothin' really mattered at all  
  
You see, I can't sleep all night long  
Tossin' and a-turnin'  
thoughts they keep a-churnin'  
I can't sleep all night long  
As a matter of fact  
I just want to get back  
  
[Chorus]  
Back to the rockin' horse  
Back to where it all began  
Take me back-back to the rockin' horse  
And start all over again  
  
My parents think I'm crazy  
And the doctor says I cracked  
But they don't understand me  
Cause I just want to go back  
  
You see I can't sleep all night long  
Tossin' and a-turnin  
Thoughts they keep a-churnin'  
I can't sleep all night long  
As a matter of fact  
I just want to get back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Like this

Come on, come on  
Get on your dress and put on a smile  
Lets lose this place  
and get out awhile, awhile, awhile  
  
You don't need nothin' fancy  
Just a whole lot of attitude  
I'll be your man now baby  
If you're doing what I want you to do  
  
I keep on tellin' ya  
  
[Chorus]  
She's my ball and chain  
My lock and key  
And I'm liking it baby  
She's my ball and chain  
My lock and key  
And I'm liking it good  
  
I'll t-t-t-tell ya  
Momma always said  
There was plenty of fish in the sea  
So I baited my hook but good  
And caught one for me, just for me  
  
She'll set you up with her body  
And then knock you out with charm  
She's just a little too nasty baby  
But that never did me no harm, no  
I keep on telling ya  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And she'll always be wrapped tight around me  
I t-t-t-tell ya

So you want to talk about the pain  
Talk to me, please explain  
Maybe I know what your going through  
  
You got so much pain to hide  
You keep it locked up deep inside  
In a room no one gets to  
  
I can't feel the way you feel  
Maybe i, I've got those same scars, same scars to heal  
Wish you've got to understand  
I want to be the only man to  
Ever touch you baby  
To ever  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll be there should the sun go down  
Lift you up to a higher ground  
Let me in, let me be the one  
I'll be there should you fall from grace  
Wipe those tear drops from your face  
I see no more damage done  
Baby, baby,  
Just let me be the one  
  
I want to be the one to show to you?  
Should the rains come down  
Never let you drown  
I'll pull you through  
  
I want to hear you when you scream  
Be your prince when you dream  
Hold you close when you cry  
  
I said  
I want to feel your love, your hate  
Should you be lost, I'll bear your cross of pain  
Love seal your fate  
I'll comfort you in fits of rage  
I'll be the book you can turn the page, and  
I'll still love baby  
I'll still  
  
Chorus  
  
I gotta touch you I'll see no more damage done  
You gotta let me  
  
Solo  
  
I hear the hurt I hear the scars  
You can lay your hand right down across my heart  
Then you'll learn to understand  
I want to be the only man to  
Ever touch you baby, ever touch you baby ever  
  
Chorus  
  
I'll be calm in fits of rage  
Hold you close in times of pain  
I see more damage done  
Baby, baby, you got to let me be the one

She's got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
I'd like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I ain't got no luck  
Can't change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't stand up  
Blame it on you  
I'm keepin' my mouth shut  
Blame it on you  
I can't see straight  
Blame it on you  
Uh-oh, too late  
  
I want a little reaction  
How 'bout a kiss or two?  
She said, "Jump back honey,"  
I said, "no can do."  
  
Why do you always make a fool out of me?  
I can't get no nookie  
Just plain to see  
  
Wastes all my money  
Spends all my time  
I ain't got no luck  
Can't change her mind  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
I'm in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess it's true  
Blame it on you  
Yes, I do  
  
I blame this whole damn mess, honey  
Right on you  
  
Now listen little girl, let me explain  
Why you got me in such a terrible way  
She's got pizazz  
Like a razzmatazz  
I'd like to slide it in  
But where do I begin  
  
Blame it on you  
I can't get no sleep  
Blame it on you  
I'm in six feet deep  
Blame it on you  
Well I guess it's true  
Blame it on you  
Yes, I do

Like this I've never seen a woman baby  
That looks quite the way you do  
The way you shake that thing now honey,  
Can't take my eyes off you  
  
The way you work it honey  
It brings me to my knees  
You give me what I'm looking for,  
I'll give you what you need  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
I got the one thing you want,  
Get it all night long  
You got the one thing I need,  
When your body talks  
I hear it talking to me  
Say, get it all night long  
Woman why can't you see  
You're my one thing  
  
I got a world of trouble, baby  
It's going on inside my head  
Playing your game, got me half insane  
Trying to make sense of every word you said  
  
Stop beating around the bush  
You're just wasting time  
Let's get down to the business honey  
And lay it one the line  
And I said  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Tell me the news,  
Let's hear your story  
You think you got nothing to lose  
You better use it up  
Before it gets old, baby  
And becomes yesterday's news  
  
[Chorus]

Stand and rise and before your eyes  
The lions will appear  
And when they do they'll be filling you  
With all the lies you will need to hear  
  
Mr. Politician, just keep on dishin'  
Your shit for the TV screen  
Turn off his camera, he'll drop the propaganda  
Faster than the poverty that he just seen  
  
Got to bring it home  
We got to bring it home  
  
See his campaign run by the power funds  
And makin' all the deals he can  
Isn't it funny what greed and money  
Can do to the soul of a man  
  
We don't seen nothin', hear nothin'  
Just get their news stuffed down our throats at 10  
Makes it hard to conceive who the fuck to believe  
When I don't see no means to an end  
  
[Chorus]  
We got to bring it home  
I don't know what to believe  
We got to bring it home  
Don't you think you're fooling me  
We got to bring it home  
In this world that's grown so cold  
We got to bring it home  
We will never know until we bring it home  
  
Watch the walls around come tumbling down  
Like a house that's built on a hill  
How can we change a thing or even get in the ring  
If we're living our lives in guilt  
  
We don't see it comin' hear it comin'  
Acting like we know nothing, chills me to the bone  
Sure as hell stop foolin' ourselves  
Till we bring it home  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Time has come now to bring it home  
We got to get it home  
Time has come now to bring it home  
We got to get it home  
The truth we will never find  
Until we bring it home

My chick is driving me crazy  
She thinks that I'm lazy  
Just because I'm good at nothing all day  
  
My baby don't get it  
So my job, I quit it  
Bust my ass,  
Hell I barely get paid  
  
People like to put me down  
And just because I hang around  
Don't they understand it's my way?  
  
[Chorus]  
Everybody tries to break me  
Say they love me when they hate me  
Baby you just can't bring me down  
I've seen long and lonely days  
And I have lost and found my ways  
So baby you just can't bring me down  
  
Yeah, bring me down  
  
Baby I'm leaving  
You've got my heart bleeding  
So I'm taking the easier way out  
  
The angel in my head  
Is now the devil in my bed  
If my walls could talk they would shout  
  
Baby you can talk and talk  
The hurt you caused, it just don't stop  
I think I'm going out of my brain  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I got a car, it go fast  
Cute fuzzy dice up on the dash  
Got a bumper sticker, just say "peace"  
Keep a gun under my seat  
To protect me from the pain  
Should your words get in my brain  
Can't you love me just the same  
Can't you love me just the  
  
[Chorus]

I've got no worries  
I've got no regrets  
Who they think they're kidding  
They ain't seen nothing yet  
  
You point my finger try to tell me I'm wrong  
That never stopped me from singin' my song  
I got the last laugh at the things they do  
Eliminate them at the turn of a screw  
  
I never lived by nobody's rules  
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools  
Can't push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back, it's my turn to fly  
  
[Chorus]  
Come hell, hell or high water  
Nothing's gonna hold me down  
Come hell, hell or high water  
Ain't no body messin' me around  
  
I see their wicked ways  
and miles of endless lies  
Their jaded lives  
Couldn't erase my smile  
  
But what's this shit that I just heard  
Son of a bitch you're working on my nerves  
I'll watch you choke on your last words  
It's about time you got what you deserved  
  
I never lived by nobody's rules  
I won't be sinking on that ship of fools  
Can't push me no matter how hard they try  
Stand back, it's my turn to fly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I've got something that's been on my mind  
Come close I'll tell you the problem that I find  
I'm sick and tired of the damage you've done  
Don't blame me I ain't the one  
Blame yourself for the ghosts in your past  
Kiss my ass  
  
[Chorus]

Coughing, Blues?: "Gol, Bret--don't touch me there!"  
Bret: I'm gonna tell you who we are.  
  
Well we're big rock singers  
we got golden fingers  
And we're loved everywhere we go  
(That sounds like us)  
  
We sing about beauty  
and we sing about truth  
At ten million dollars a show  
(Yeah, right!)  
  
We take all kinda pills  
That give us all kinda thrills  
But the thrill we've never known  
Is the thrill that it gets ya  
when you get your picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
[Chorus]  
Rolling Stone  
I'm gonna see my picture on the cover  
Stone  
Gonna buy five copies for my mother  
Stone  
Gonna see my smiling face  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
I got a freaky old lady named Cocaine Katie  
Who embroiders on my jeans  
I got my poor old gray-haired Daddy  
Driving my limousine.  
  
Now it's all designed to blow our minds,  
But our minds won't really be blown  
Like the blow that'll getcha  
When you get your picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
  
[Chorus]  
Spoken: Hey, I know how!!!  
Solo  
Spoken: Beautiful!  
  
We gotta lot of little teen-aged  
blue-eyed groupies  
Who do anything we say  
We got a genuine Indian Guru  
He's teaching us a better way  
  
We got all the friends that money can buy,  
So we never have to be alone  
And we keep gettin' richer,  
But we can't get our picture  
On the cover of the Rolling Stone  
[  
Chorus]  
  
I don't know why we ain't on the cover, baby!  
Ah we're beautiful fellas!  
I ain't kiddin' you man, we'd make a beautiful cover  
I mean, I can see it right now--we be up front,  
Oh, we be smilin'... Beautiful!

Well when you're sitting there in your silk upholstered chair  
Talkin' to some rich folk that you know  
Well I hope you won't see me in my ragged company  
Hell, you know I could never be alone  
  
[Chorus:]  
Take me down little Susie, take me down  
I know you think you're the queen of the underground  
And you can send me dead flowers every morning  
Send me dead flowers by the mail  
Send me dead flowers to my wedding  
And I won't forget to put roses on your grave  
  
Well when you're sitting back in that rose pink Cadillac  
Making bets on Kentucky Derby Day  
I'll be in my room with my needle and my spoon  
And another girl she gonna take my pain away  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
And, I won't forget to put roses on your grave

Mr. Rockett, give me some drums!  
  
She'll slide you in, you taste the sin  
She slowly gets inside your head  
You feel her take control and she'll steal your soul  
She's the devil lying in your bed  
She's the lord of your thighs and it's no surprise  
You're playing with loaded gun  
She's a killer queen and she'll lick you clean  
Then she'll spit you out when she's done  
  
[Chorus]  
Devil woman, evil woman  
She'll make you believe  
L.A. woman, she's my woman  
Brings out the devil in me  
  
She got blood red lips and head trips  
Leave a poor boy beggin' for more  
When you get that itch ain't love a bitch  
Now you need her just a little more  
She's a soul taker, a ball breaker  
And boy she's gonna break you  
She's gonna steal your heart, steal your money  
Laugh at you when she's through  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Well the way she'll do you  
Things you ain't never seen  
She can tear right through you  
You can never leave  
  
[Chorus: x2]

When I was a child staring at the tube  
I saw sex, violence and death on the news  
One day I saw the Duke kill someone  
Daddy said don't worry boy, they're just acting son  
  
All I want is attention from somebody  
Somebody pay attention to me  
Like them actors I got no shame  
I want my fifteen minutes of fame  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
Can I get on the news if I kill my wife?  
Would you respect me more if I took my life?  
I tried to act and my career just flopped  
So I beat up my neighbors and I got on "Cops"  
  
All I want's a millions bucks from somebody  
Somebody pay a million bucks to me  
  
I could shoot and rape and kill  
And buy me a house in Beverly Hills, please?  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
I'd even do a porno flick, like all them Hollywood chicks  
I'm doin' it as I see on my TV  
  
Took my girl to rent a porno movie  
I thought that it'd be kinda groovy  
I thought that'd this impress my lover  
And there she was right on the cover!  
  
All I want is attention from somebody  
Somebody pay attention to me  
I'm a man I got no shame  
I want my fifteen minutes of fame  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
Hell I'd even do a porno flick, like my hero Rocky did  
  
Doin' as I see on my TV  
  
Whistling, gargling  
  
I am not aware!

[Chorus]  
Don't give up an inch girl  
If you won't take me for the mile  
Don't give up an inch girl  
If you won't take me for a mile  
  
Miles from home and I'm all alone  
And looking for a first time  
We took a long ride  
And there by your side  
I did my first crime  
  
Well Mary Mary quite contrary  
Just how does your garden grow  
She said you ring my bell  
And rattle my shell  
I'll be your pretty maid all in a row  
  
Put me to the test  
Lay me down to rest  
While your nails cut me up like a knife  
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo  
And scarred this poor boy for life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It was a hot one  
In the summer sun  
And more than heat was rising  
I remember that September  
And just how you left me smiling  
  
I left there shaken  
Body was achin'  
Like it never did before  
  
Begged and pleaded  
Swear I needed  
Needed you a whole lot more  
  
Put me to the test  
Lay me down to rest  
While your nails cut me up like a knife  
Put me in you like a flesh tattoo  
And scarred this poor boy for life  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Made this boy's bell ring  
And there I earned my wings  
Left me there in sweet pain  
Hell I'll never be the same  
  
[Chorus]

Now that you've been bought and sold  
You don't got time to fix the mess your in  
And if I may be so bold  
I bet you couldn't even do it again.  
  
Lying like yesterday's paper  
Just outside your door  
  
Chorus:  
Now you need me to clean your shoes  
Walk on water be in the mood  
Everybody's talking but nobody knows  
Where did the emporer get them new clothes  
  
I always did look up to you  
I tried to copy everything that you did  
Until you broke my heart in two  
You shot me up and then you flipped your lid  
  
Lying like yessterdays paper  
Just outside your door  
  
Repeat Chorus

We both lie silently still  
In the dead of the night  
Although we both lie close together  
We feel miles apart inside  
  
Was it something I said or something I did  
Did the words not come out right  
Though I tried not to hurt you  
Though I tried  
But I guess that's why they say  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every rose has its thorn  
Just like every night has its dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has its thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
I listen to our favorite song  
Playing on the radio  
Hear the dj say loves a game  
Of easy come and easy go  
But I wonder does he know  
Has he ever felt like this  
And I know that you'd be here right now  
If I could have let you know somehow  
I guess  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every rose has its thorn  
Just like every night has its dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has its thorn  
Yeah it does  
  
Though it's been a while now  
I can still feel so much pain  
Like a knife that cuts you the wound heals  
But the scar, that scar remains  
  
I know I could have saved a love that night  
If I'd known what to say  
Instead of makin' love  
We both made our separate ways  
But now I hear you found somebody new  
And that I never meant that much to you  
To hear that tears me up inside  
And to see you cuts me like a knife  
I guess  
  
[Chorus:]  
Every rose has its thorn  
Just like every night has its dawn  
Just like every cowboy sings his sad, sad song  
Every rose has its thorn  
Yeah it does

Well, I calls my baby on the telephone  
She says hurry home Bret cause I'm all alone  
Oh now giddyap, hurry, and don't be late  
Cause a be -be -be -be -baby I just can't wait  
  
She starts talkin' dirty right in my ear  
Making herself so perfectly clear  
She needs some good love  
  
So I roll her over in the middle of the night  
and I rock my baby 'til the morning light  
Gettin' hot, good love, yeah.  
  
Well the good people say I'm a sinnin' man  
But if they knew my baby they would understand  
The neighbors keep yellin' bout all the noise  
They say the things you're doin' ain't natural, boy  
  
Well my baby she just loves to play  
And I need my baby each and every day  
Need some good love  
  
We're hoppin' and a bobbin' in the old moonlight  
Rockin' and a rollin' til the morning light  
Gettin hot....good love  
Bring it home  
  
Solo  
  
Well my baby she just loves to play  
And I need my baby each and every day  
Need some good love  
  
Well my daddy thinks that I've gone crazy  
And my poor boss swears I'm losin' my cool  
But I just want to play with my baby  
If you only knew what she could do  
  
She starts talkin' dirty right in my ear  
Makin' herself so perfectly clear  
need some good love  
  
Baby she just loves to play  
and I need my baby each and every day  
  
Start hoppin' bobbin' in the old moonlight  
Rockin' and a rollin' til the morning light  
  
Gettin' hot, hot, hot  
good love  
so damn hot

[Chorus]  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
(Let's go)  
Saturday night Rainbow bar and grill  
Where there's Cocaine lines and a little white pill  
A beer and a gin, now I can't see straight  
Slip it in, no glove, oops too late  
I remember her face but forgot her name  
She forgot mine too ain't that a shame  
Smelled like reefer and my hairs in a mess  
I left my love running down her dress  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dave from Drowning Pool is here  
Steal's my women and he drinks my beer  
Buys me a pizza and a shot of Jim Beam  
And as who the fuck is Angeline  
I go to piss in the parking lot well  
I get in a fight but I don't get caught  
Hell no problem 'cause the nights still young  
I want a little more gonna get ya some  
  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
(CC lets go)  
  
Rock stars, movie stars, a Hollywood scene  
I eat dinner with Nick Cage and Charlie Sheen  
Nick asks me what the hell Unskinny Bop means  
It's slang for CC banging a porno queen  
  
Mario, Michael, Tony and Steady  
R.V. won't ya get table six ready  
My Platinum records hang all around  
Rainbow's home when I'm in this town  
  
[Chorus]

[Chorus]  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
I want to go  
I want to go home now  
  
You know I never ever thought I would say just how much I love L.A.  
Until we got aboard a plane and toured around the world  
  
We went to London, Paris, France and Spain, all it fuckin' did was rain  
Bobby went insane and Bret left with a geisha girl  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Rikki has so many bags, customs almost beat his ass  
They threw me out of first class 'cause I said we were the bomb  
  
The tour bus that we had won't go  
Got stuck in seven feet of snow  
The road crew couldn't get no blow  
And the sound man broke his arm  
  
[Chorus: x2]

If there's a tear on my face  
It makes me shiver to the bone  
It shakes me, babe  
It's just a heartache that got caught in my eye  
And you know I never cry, I never cry  
  
Sometimes I drink more than I need  
Until the TV's dead and gone  
I may be lonely  
But I'm never alone  
And the night may pass me by  
But I never cry  
  
Take away, take away my eyes  
Sometimes I'd rather be blind  
Break a heart, break a heart of stone  
Open it up but don't you leave it alone  
  
'Cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin, it ain't never been tried  
And you know I never cry  
Yeah you know I never cry  
Well you know, you know, you know, you know I never cry  
I never cry  
  
Break a heart, go ahead, break a heart of stone  
Open it up, but don't you leave it alone  
'Cause that's all I got to give you  
Believe me babe, it ain't been used  
My heart's a virgin it ain't never been tried  
And you know I never cry  
I never cry

I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
  
I grab my hat and I  
Grab my shoes  
Tonight I'm gonna hit  
The streets and cruise  
  
Down the main strip and  
Check it out  
With those schoolgirls  
A hangin' around  
  
Now I'm a sucker for a pretty face  
I don't care if she's in leather or lace  
Cause I'm just lookin' for a little kiss  
  
[Chorus]  
I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
You've got the love I need tonight  
  
Long legs and short skirts  
These girls hit me where it hurts  
  
I can't wait to get my hands on them  
I won't give up until they give in  
  
Now I'm not lookin' for a love that lasts  
I need a shot and I need it fast  
If I can't have her, I'll take her and make her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, sweetheart, slide on in here  
No, not in the front, jump in the back  
Why?  
'Cause there's something back there I want to show ya  
I want action tonight  
Satisfaction all night  
Ah, come on honey, I wasn't that bad!  
Oh, well  
  
[Chorus]

Late at night I close my eyes  
And think of how things could have been  
And when I look back  
I remember some words you had said to me  
  
It's better to have lost at love  
Then never to have loved at all  
  
[Chorus]  
I won't forget you baby  
(I won't forget you)  
Even though I should  
I won't forget you baby  
(I won't forget you)  
Even though I should, yeah  
  
Sometimes in my head  
I can still see pictures of you  
And I laugh to myself  
When I think of all those crazy things that we used to do  
  
Although miles come between us  
Just between you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I should let you fade away  
But that just wouldn't be me  
Oh, baby  
  
Although miles come between us  
Just between you and me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I won't forget you baby

I've spent my life waiting  
For that famous final scene  
I believe you know the one--  
When she falls in love with me  
  
As for you, you've been fakin' your smile  
Fillin' your time  
On small talk  
And cheap wine  
Knowing in your heart there was someplace  
That you'd rather be  
  
So right or wrong,  
I wrote you this song  
To tell you how I feel  
  
Don't put up no fight  
You just turn off the lights  
Walk over here to me  
  
[Chorus]  
And lay your body down on me  
Down on me tonight, oh yeah  
Oh, let your tears fall down on me  
Down on me tonight, oh yeah  
  
As for me I've lied to, denied to  
Fight with, and tried to  
Apologize for all my ways  
To all the women who were fool enough to fall  
In love with me  
  
You played your role  
Like a movie  
Got your lines for who is,  
Who was, who would be  
Somehow you lost track  
While real love slipped away, yeah  
  
So for tonight, just turn off the lights  
And let those real feelings show  
There's no wrong or right  
But until you try  
You're never gonna know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Before you was mine  
I was so lonely  
Ain't it a shame  
Your heart must feel pain  
Before you get back on your feet again  
  
So let's draw the blinds  
Forget wasted time  
And let them old demons die  
Take a hold of my hand  
Then you'd understand  
Why love's worth one more try  
  
[Chorus]

Sitting here in my cell writing a letter  
Thanking all the people who made my living conditions better  
  
And thanks to the justice system  
I'm making a million  
My lawyer got me a book deal  
Now I'm making a killing just from making a killing  
  
I got an agent for the publicity  
An accountant to count my royalties  
The talk shows want me, sorry I can't go  
I'm stuck here on death row  
  
You call me hannibal lechter, if I was smarter  
If I was charlie manson you'd make me a martyr wouldn't ya  
You'd call me a handsome man if I was bundy  
But if I looked like john wayne gasey you'd just say I'm funny, not ha ha
funny  
  
Chorus:  
Tried to act my career just flopped  
Killed my neighbor, got on cops  
Problem is, I only made one show now  
I'm stuck here on death row  
  
The poor victim's families never make a dime  
Networks say I'm not prime time  
All my cell mates on my cell block  
Say I'm the hottest topic at the coffee shops  
  
Waitress cries, "god how they should free me"  
Send me her love letters, says someday she'd really love to meet me  
Tells her customers people should forgive me for the things I do  
I wonder if I kill her would her family forgive me too?  
  
Chorus  
Thanks for the attention and the publicity  
The taxpayer's dollars that you spend on me  
Thanks for the good meal, dry bed, and these warm clothes  
I'm alive and well on death row

I felt this before  
Now I feel it again  
No matter how hard I try  
This feeling won't end  
  
So I pretend you're here by my side  
Tonight on this lonely ride  
I keep telling myself that  
  
[Chorus]  
Life goes on while you're miles away  
And I need you  
Time goes on as night steals the day  
There's nothing I can do  
  
You heal up my wounds  
I tasted your tears  
You spilled out your heart  
So I let out my fears  
  
But one fear that I kept to myself  
Was how I prayed that you'd love no one else  
Like you're saying you love me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
If you only knew how much I miss you  
  
When my mind plays these tricks on me  
It shows me things I don't want to see  
That's why I tell myself  
I keep telling myself  
Just take another piece of me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
And this last mile I travel with you

North side, east side  
Little Willy, Willy wears the crown, he's the king around town  
Dancing, glancing  
Willy drives them silly with his star shoe shimmy shuffle down  
Way past one, and feeling alright  
'Cause with little Willy round they can last all night  
Hey down, stay down, stay down, down  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little Willy, Willy won't go home  
But you can't push Willy round  
Willy won't go, try tellin' everybody but, oh no  
Little Willy, Willy won't go home  
  
Up town, down town  
Little Willy, Willy drives them wild with his runaround style  
Inside, outside  
Willy sends them silly with his star-shine shimmy shuffle smile  
Mama done chase Willy down the hall  
But laugh, Willy laugh, he don't care at all  
Hey down, stay down, stay down, down  
'Cause  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
Little Willy, Willy won't  
Willy won't, Willy won't  
  
[Chorus x2]

I just needed someone to hold  
When the bottle was empty  
and the nights grew cold  
  
In my hour of darkness  
In my time of need  
You were my angel of mercy  
And helped me to believe  
  
You touched my soul  
When I was lonely  
You held me up  
when I couldn't fly  
  
There's no words could explain  
How I feel inside  
And this I tell you  
  
In a world full of anger  
and times gone strange  
You held me close  
You held me close to you  
  
Lay my head on your shoulder  
I finally let it all out  
It felt good for a moment  
Not living in a shadow of doubt  
  
But everybody needs a little something  
Tu pull them through  
I gave one for the other  
And God know that the other was you  
  
Chorus:  
Now only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love is scratched in sand  
Or if it's etched in stone  
Only time will tell  
Only time will tell  
If our love will stand  
Or walk the road along  
  
My angel of mercy  
Pulled me through somehow  
I just hope you know  
I need you now  
  
You're the one  
That touched my very soul  
The one who held on tight  
God knows you never let go  
  
Angel of mercy  
It's time we closed the door  
Put out the lights  
And burn the fire  
Burn the fire inside  
  
Angel of mercy  
You pulled me through  
And this I tell to you  
God know I'd tell it to you

Good evening people, Welcome to my party  
Bring on the night, let's get it started  
You want blood on the stage, well baby you've got it  
  
I welcome all the people who have truly been my friends  
Fuck all the bitches who broke my heart again  
Love all the women who made my head spin  
  
Baby, because they love me  
I can make the sun go down  
And I say give the power to the people, people  
  
Bossman, Somebody always tryin' to break me  
Slick mofo, he's always tryin' to take me  
In this arena only you can make me  
  
Sex and violence, A love in a rage  
I'm pacing like a beast locked in a cage  
I'm a comin' I'm a comin' I'm a comin' of age  
  
But I know you want me, right  
I can make the sun go down  
And I say give the power to the people

You are the power that gives me the right  
Together we own the night  
  
Good evening people, Welcome to my party  
Bring on the night, we can get it started

And I say give the power to the people

And I say give the power to the

Well I'm sitting here this evening  
I've got some old friends on my mind, yeah I do  
Yeah, me and Slick and Davy saluting Mr. Daniels  
For the very first time  
We was jamming to old Jimi, singing Purple Haze,  
No doubt, no, no  
I think between weed and whiskey  
My head went north and man, my feet went south  
  
We had some good times,  
And man do I remember them well  
Those days are long gone,  
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell  
  
[Chorus]  
Ride, child ride  
Hell we had some good times then  
Ride, child, ride  
Sometimes I need those times again  
Do you remember when?  
  
Remember all our big talk,  
How we were going to be president, one day, baby  
How we were going to save the whole world  
But man, I got to tell you Lord,  
Didn't have a clue back then  
  
We had some good times,  
And man do I remember them well  
Those days are long gone,  
But now I got to tell you just how we left some stories to tell  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ride, child, ride  
Hell, we had some good times then  
Ride, child ride  
Sometimes I need those times again  
Ride, child ride  
Hell, we had some good times then  
Ride, child, ride  
Take me back there, man, do you remember when?

Hearts of fire  
Streets of stone  
Modern warriors  
Saddle iron horses of chrome  
  
Taste the wild  
Lick the wind  
Like something they never saw before  
Their jaws dropping to the floor  
Steel made of soul and sin  
  
Rebels born without a care  
And the day he listens  
Only to fly where eagles dare  
And the night she whispers  
  
[Chorus]  
Ride the wind  
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun  
Ride the wind  
Never coming back again  
Ride the wind  
Never coming back until I touch the midnight sun  
  
Painted flesh  
Loyalty  
Humble pride  
Just as far as the eye can see  
  
Stories told  
Two old friends  
Of battle scars and lonely bars  
And nights the rain wouldn't end  
  
Here's to withered eyes wearing gypsy smiles  
And the day he listens  
Here's to lovely ladies and a million miles  
And the night she whispers  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ride the wind  
I'm still the bravest soul in sin,  
Burning till the night is done.  
  
Of all the truths and lies  
And stories of riders in the sky  
They say only the bravest try  
Where eagles and angels dare to fly  
  
[Chorus]

All by yourself  
So please allow me  
To introduce myself  
  
I welcome you  
To the house of sin  
Open your mind  
And let the games begin

Please do not try these tricks at home

A small town girl with big time dreams  
But nothing's ever as it seems  
A mother waves her girl goodbye  
Then slowly hangs her head and cries  
Hollywood hills and the big city lights  
Outside her window they burn bright  
Someday the world will praise her fame  
They'll know her face they'll shout her name  
  
They'll shout it real loud  
She'll make her mama real proud  
She'll stand above the crowd  
  
I am someone  
Look what I've done  
Stare into the sun  
I am a shooting star  
I am something  
I am someone  
Look what I've done  
I am a shooting star  
  
She looks down at the stars, lying on the streets  
Says to herself "that will be me"  
A big time dream, a small town mind  
Searching for a break, she may never find  
Streets of gold, they turned to grey  
Just one more chance, just one more day  
Someday that world will know this face  
She swears they'll never fall from grace  
  
They'll shout it real loud  
She'll make her mama real proud  
She'll stand above the crowd  
And shout  
  
She stands out on the streets in the pouring rain  
Strangers walk by they don't know her name  
As the silver screen slowly fades to black  
She'll never give in, she can never go back  
  
Someday you'll see me  
Don't you need me  
Everybody will believe me  
I am a shooting star  
  
I will stand strong  
I will hold on  
It's not my last song  
I am a shooting star

Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
Drop the bass  
  
Shipped out on of knees  
Her old man thinks you're a social disease  
Dog pissed on the floor left a stain  
Your old lady's daddy driving you insane  
She stopped taking the pill  
Then left you sued you for a mil  
You've got your problems, boy so damn great  
  
(Ha Ha Ha, How do they do that?  
  
Can't find a good wife can't find a good job  
Can't find the keys to my car  
I lost my dog I lost my brain  
I lost my girl to a big movie star (whatever)  
  
Now I'm standing at the crossroads trying to find my way home  
But the truth is baby I'm so  
Lonely, lonely, lonely, lonely  
Sometimes I'd just  
  
Chorus:  
Like to jump in and get me some funky  
When push comes to shove  
You talk too much and way too rough  
How 'bout we both shut up and let's make love  
  
I'm home hangin', the walls are bangin'  
It's the neighbors next door  
They're talking trashy or doing the nasty  
They keep me up until four  
  
So they keep on going more and more  
I hear and said "Lord, I'm half crazy"  
I gotta get me some of that  
In and out, and in and out,and in and out  
  
Chorus  
  
When the clothes start flying  
There's no denying  
Gonna get some funky  
Good, good funky  
  
Your blood starts pumpin'  
Baby start somethin'  
Here oh right here, right here baby  
Oh give me a little bit of loving  
  
Solo  
  
It's all so simple  
I'll bring the ripple  
When she stayed all night  
  
How 'bout we drink, get drunk  
  
  
Chorus  
  
Alt Chorus  
  
When push comes to shove  
Skip your lip and all the politics  
How 'bout we both shut up and let's make love  
  
It would sound like this....  
Boom, boom, ha, ha, boom, boom, ha, ha  
Stop!  
Aight!

Well I see him on the TV  
Preachin' 'bout the promised land  
He tells me to believe in Jesus  
And steals the money from my hand  
Some say he was a good man  
But Lord I think he sinned, yeah  
Twenty-two years of mental tears  
Cries a suicidal Vietnam vet  
Who fought a losing war on a foreign shore  
To find his country didn't want him back  
Their bullets took his best friend in Saigon  
Our lawyers took his wife and kids,  
no regrets  
In a time I don't remember  
In a war he can't forget  
He cried "Forgive me for  
what I've done there  
Cause I never meant the things I did"  
  
[Chorus]  
And give me something to believe in  
If there's a Lord above  
And give me something to believe in  
  
Oh, Lord arise  
My best friend died a lonely man  
In some Palm Springs hotel room  
I got the call last Christmas Eve  
  
And they told me the news  
I tried all night not to break down and cry  
As the tears rolled down my face  
I felt so cold and empty  
Like a lost soul out of place  
And the mirror, mirror on the wall  
Sees my smile it fades again  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Sometimes I wish to God  
I didn't know now  
The things I didn't know then  
Road you gotta take me home  
  
I drive by the homeless sleeping on  
a cold dark street  
Like bodies in an open grave  
Underneath the broken old neon sign  
That used to read  
Jesus Saves  
A mile away live the rich folks  
And I see how they're living it up  
While the poor they eat from hand to mouth  
The rich is drinkin' from a golden cup  
And it just makes me wonder  
Why so many lose, so few win  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You take the high road  
And I'll take the low road  
Sometimes I wish to God  
I didn't know now  
The things I didn't know then  
And give me something to believe in

It takes two to tango  
In the heat of the night  
You're gonna give it in  
No matter how you fight  
  
Hot nights, pretty women  
And a bottle of gin  
Fine floozy sitting pretty  
In the city of sin  
I'm knocking on your back door  
Baby let me in  
  
Chorus:  
I'll take you down  
Light your fuse baby  
Set your soul on fire  
Make your body sweat  
Soaking wet  
In the midnight hour  
  
Step closer my seniorita  
It's so nice to meet ya  
I see your eyes say no  
But your flesh is weak  
  
Well sweet salt shaker  
And rattle my bones  
One more inch I'm gonna drive it home  
Hate to see a pretty little woman all alone  
  
Chorus  
  
She said are you gonna nibble baby  
Or are you gonna take yourself a bite  
You invite me closer honey  
And I just might  
  
I don't want money or a big black car  
I just wanna know how I'm doing so far  
So far I'm gonna do you just right  
  
Chorus

Mama's got a squeeze box  
She wears on her chest  
Daddy come home  
And never get no rest  
  
[Chorus:]  
'Cause she's playing all night  
And the music's all right  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
  
Well, the kid won't eat  
And the dog won't sleep  
No escape from the music  
On the whole damn street  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She goes in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out  
  
[Chorus]  
  
She goes squeeze me  
Come on and squeeze me  
Come on and tease me like you do  
I'm so in love with you  
Mama's got a squeeze box  
Daddy never sleeps at night  
Come on she should play that thing  
  
She goes in and out, in and out, in and out, in and out  
  
[Chorus x2]

We all carry the cross and speak what we're taught  
Lies and money become the white man's god  
We've burned all our bridges one too many times  
The time has come now to draw the line  
  
[Chorus]  
You know you've got to  
Stand, stand, stand for what you believe  
You know you've got to  
Stand, stand, stand for what you believe  
Oh, you got to stand for what you believe  
  
Alright, alright  
You got to listen now  
Express yourself in the face of change  
Repress yourself, you surely seal your fate  
You got to look inside, the answer lies in wait  
Resurrect before it's too late  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody rescue me, come down and rescue me  
I know the soul of a good man has got to be free  
When you stand, stand for what you believe  
  
[Chorus]

Listen up, child, there's one thing I've got to make clear  
Yeah, I do  
You don't see it coming  
hear it coming  
Acting like you know nothing  
About that strange rumor going on around here  
  
Take me back to the land of the living  
Take me down where the sun do shine  
Take me back, things be different  
You get it, got it, oh, you better get it now  
  
[Chorus]  
Stay alive, let your soul rise up from the bottom  
Stay alive, don't let it take you down for the very last time  
Stay alive, It don't do you no good looking up from the bottom  
Stay alive, don't let it take you down for the very last time  
  
You talk about lies and pain  
It don't do you no good with your face in the cocaine  
  
Love, hate, watch that mother  
She'll bring you down like no other I've seen  
If you know what I mean  
  
Take me back, got to face that demon  
Take me down, don't play its fool  
Take me back, things be different  
You get it, got it, ooooh, you better get it now  
  
[Chorus]  
  
No, I ain't seen nothin'  
No, I ain't seen nothin'  
No, I ain't seen nothin' like you before  
  
[Chorus]

Vietnam was '66  
Two best friends take a bad hit  
And never saw it come  
But it's all there  
One was a rich boy, a doctors son  
The other the father of a girl age one  
Never had the change to hold his daughters hand  
  
New york flat in '76  
Two girlfriends shoot a bad fix  
Never woke up saw heaven before it saw them  
One was a daughter of a prominent man  
The other the mother of a girl age ten  
Who walked in and saw mama sleeping in gods hands  
And she cried  
  
Chorus  
Stay with me  
Mama won't you stay here with me  
You promised you would never leave  
Stay with me  
Oh won't you stay here with me  
Mama, hold my had and stay with me  
  
Years go by, the girl's 23  
Had a rough go, but she's on her feet  
The man so rough  
A few good years, a wedding ring  
Wasn't enough to fulfill his dreams  
He came home from work one day and said I'm leaving you  
She cried...  
  
Chorus  
Stay with me, honey  
Won't you stay right here with me  
You promised you would never leave  
Stay with me, whoa whoa  
Stay right here with me  
Won't you hold my hand stay with me  
  
Emergency room, number four  
A woman cried out as the child is born  
She stares into eyes and says  
My life's had it's ups and downs  
But for yours I will be around  
I will always be around  
And she cried  
  
Chorus  
Stay with me, whoa whoa  
Won't you stay right here with me  
I promise I will never leave  
Stay with me, oh  
Won't you stay right here with me  
Child, you hold my had stay with me  
Child, you hold my hand stay with me.

Don't matter what my name is  
Don't matter what my skin is  
Don't matter if I'm black or white  
Don't matter if I'm wrong or... Right  
  
Chorus  
I guess I'm born to lose, ummmm  
'cause execution did draw near  
I got them steel bar blues  
  
Am I innocent or guilty, man  
Dare I say yes, I guess I am  
I don't feel no pain no more  
Ain't no sunshine, that's for sure  
  
Chorus  
I guess I'm born to lose  
'cause execution did draw near  
I got them steel bar blues  
  
Yes I do.......  
  
Don't matter what my name is  
Don't matter what my skin is  
Don't matter if I'm black or white  
Don't matter if I'm wrong or... Right  
Don't matter what time it is  
Don't matter if I'm black or white  
Don't matter if I'm wrong or... Right  
  
Fade

I was heading down the highway  
She's going my way  
She climbed in, the next thing I knew  
  
We started laughing and smoking,  
We got to talking  
Yeah, we'd both been hurt a time or two  
  
I knew she didn't love me  
But I didn't think she'd want me, no  
Right there she took me  
Underneath that sun, we became one  
  
She said  
Life's a little strange  
We all need a little strange sometimes  
I'm a little strange  
A lot like you...  
(Let's ride)  
  
Halfway to Boston  
She turned down the radio  
Asked what I was looking for  
  
Then I looked in her eyes,  
For the first time I realized  
I really didn't know anymore  
  
Sometimes I think I want true love  
Most times I feel like there's no one  
But in the meantime hold me tight  
Things will be alright  
  
I said...  
Life's a little strange  
We all need a little strange sometimes  
I'm a little strange  
A lot like you...  
(Let's ride)  
  
I pulled along the highway  
The time had come to go our way  
She took my hand, looked into my eyes  
And said "won't you hold me one more time"  
  
She said...  
Life's a little strange  
We all need a little strange sometimes  
I'm a little strange a lot  
Oh baby, a lot like you...

Living off the friends we made  
Never ever getting paid  
Kicking ass and paying dues  
Lose our mind in self abuse  
  
Loving ladies by the score  
Waking up and wanting more  
I hope my Mama understands  
When I strike up the band  
  
Well I spit out my anger as the sweat do fly  
Fifteen years of paying dues just to get me by  
Now the barkeeps would pay us by the crowds we bring  
But those son-of-bitches never paid us one damn thing  
And my poor Daddy, he just don't understand  
It's balls out tonight, watch the shit hit the fan  
When we strike up the band  
  
Now those drop dead ladies line the very first row  
I do believe I'd like to spend some time after the show  
Now them years gone by, the barkeeps pay in cash  
And them lovely ladies feed me an earful of trash  
  
And my old lady, she just don't understand  
Why those floozies got their hands on her man  
And my poor Daddy, he still don't understand  
Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan  
Give it all that we can, we don't give a good damn  
When we strike up the band  
  
Living like a gypsy,  
an air conditioned hippie  
Who's never seen the light of day  
Rode dog and cowboy  
Don't know how, boy  
I ever lived this long this way, no, no, said  
  
And my poor Daddy, he still don't understand  
Why it's balls out tonight watch the shit hit the fan  
Give it all that we can, we don't give a good damn  
When we strike up the band

You know I never, I've never seen you look so good  
You never act the way you should  
But I like it  
And I know you like it too  
The way that I want you  
I've gotta have you  
Oh yes I do  
I never, I never ever stay out late  
You know that I can hardly wait  
Just to see you  
And I know you cannot wait  
Wait to see me too  
I've got to touch you  
Cause baby we'll be  
  
[Chorus]  
At the drive in  
In the old man's Ford  
Behind the bushes  
Til I'm screamin' for more  
Down in the basement  
Lock the cellar door  
And baby  
Talk dirty to me!  
  
You know I call you, I call you on the telephone  
I'm only hopin' that you're home  
So I can hear you  
When you say those words to me  
And whisper so softly  
I've gotta hear you  
Cause baby we'll be  
  
[Chorus]  
  
C.C. Pickup that guitar, and-a-talk to me, yeah  
  
Whoo! Whoo! Whoo! Whoo!  
  
Cause baby we'll be  
  
At the drive in  
In the old man's Ford  
Behind them, bushes  
Til I'm screamin' for more, more, more!  
Down in the basement  
And lock the cellar door  
And baby, talk dirty to me, yeah  
And baby, talk dirty to me yeah  
And baby  
Talk dirty to me  
  
Uh!  
Whoo!  
That's the way I like it, baby  
Ooh, yeah

You're my fatal attraction  
Oh, no, I can't stop  
You're my midnight fantasy  
You're my cream of the crop  
  
I'm comin' home girl  
I'm comin' home  
  
You're my soaking wet ecstasy  
Like sex on the beach  
I want to take you home now girl  
Gonna practice what I preach, dig  
  
I'm comin' home girl  
I'm comin' home now  
  
I can taste your sweet emotion  
I can feel it runnin' hot  
Our veins of passion pumping so strong  
We're like gas and fire  
got a burnin' desire  
Them sparks are gonna fly and we'll be  
  
[Chorus]  
Shakin' shakin'  
Tearin' down the walls  
Little by little, inch by inch  
Tearin' down the walls  
Screamin' scratchin'  
Tearin' down the walls  
Little by little, inch by inch  
Tearin' down the walls  
  
I just want to eat you up  
Like a lion in a cage  
Just get a little bit closer girl  
And that's all I'll need to say  
  
I'm comin' home girl  
I'm comin' home now  
  
You're like a slave to the rhythm  
I'm gonna put you to the test  
You turn up the heat turn on the light  
And I'll do the rest  
  
I'm comin' home girl,  
I'm comin home now  
  
I can taste your sweet emotion  
I can feel it runnin' hot  
Our veins of passion pumping so strong  
We're like gas and fire  
got a burnin' desire  
Them sparks are gonna fly and we'll be  
  
[Chorus]

Well it's boy meets girl and it starts a fire  
Two hearts burn in pure desire  
A candle burns the midnight oil  
Lust to love and raise the spoil  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Can't fight the lust  
Can't find the truth  
Ain't nothing you can do  
When the girl goes down  
  
Hollywood and Vine on the hundredth floor  
All the lies in bed, couldn't take it no more  
Now standing on the ledge and faces truth  
As she ate 'em up spit 'em out, his time is through  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Misery loves company  
Nothing you can do  
When the girl goes down  
  
Solo  
  
I woke up this morning in the paper read  
The Hollywood Police found a young man dead  
No name, no face, or known I'd  
Just no different than you and me  
  
Now someone arrives in her strange world  
And the story goes it's boy meets girl  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Chorus:  
When the girl goes down  
That's the way I like it, like it, like it, like it  
When the wheel goes 'round  
Neither one can fight it  
  
Can't fight the lust  
Can't find the truth  
Ain't nothing you can do

He swears he'll love you by candlelight  
And for a while things seem all right  
And for a moment he hides  
The devil that lies inside  
  
And then one night in a fit of rage  
The demon raises his hand in hate  
And brings it down on you  
There is nothing you can do  
  
And then one night in a twist of fate  
The angels bring your face to me  
I cannot erase the memories  
Of you lying there looking up at me  
  
Chorus  
Please take the demon from my head  
Won't you please erase the memories  
And ghosts who haunt my bed  
I just want you to understand  
That I'm gonna be the only man  
To ever touch your soul  
And I ain't never letting go  
  
There's a room that lies down the hall  
Where you sit and write you poems  
Of love and mystery  
Of faith and fantasy  
  
And you keep a secret lover there  
And a book beside an easy chair  
That you read before you go to bed  
To hide the memories in your head  
  
And now I try to understand the pain  
You struggle for the words to say  
It don't come out right  
As you lay your body down  
  
Chorus  
  
There's a place where you go  
I've been, I'll never know  
The pain you keep inside  
The secrets that you hide  
  
But I try to understand your pain  
And be a shelter from the falling rain  
Just maybe I feel what you're going through  
Maybe I have been there too  
  
Please take the demons from my head  
Won't you please take the demons from my head  
(I shall try)  
Repeat

There's a rose on the bed  
A letter that I wrote what you mean to me  
Words I wished I'd said,  
Were still in my head, now I pray you'd see  
  
I don't know how to tell you that I miss you, baby  
I struggle with the words sometimes  
But in my heart, I know you'll find  
  
Chorus:  
I know, you know  
Our souls will be together till the end of time  
You know, I know  
Your love is gonna meet me on the other side  
As sure as the angels come down and take my breath away  
I love you'd be the last thing I'd ever say  
  
I'd ever say....  
  
You walked beside me,  
You stood by me and got me through my darkest times  
And now I close my eyes  
And visuallize your face for the last time  
  
I didn't know how to tell you that I loved you baby  
I struggle with the words sometimes  
But in my heart, I know you'll find  
  
Chorus:  
I know, you know  
Our souls will be together till the end of time  
You know, I know  
Your love is gonna meet me on the other side  
As sure as the angels come down and take my breath away  
I love you'd be the last thing I'd ever say  
  
I never fell in love,  
No one ever touched me like this before  
You opened my eyes  
Made me realize something worth living for  
  
Solo (guitar and piano)  
  
But if fate took you from me before I got to let you know  
You're the one thing in my life worth dying for  
If the world fell apart,  
I know in my heart  
I know would never change  
If the devil himself  
Tried to raise hell's bells  
I know it would be in vain  
If the heavens come down  
Let 'em fall to the ground  
Let 'em take my breath away  
I love you'd be the last thing I'd ever say

Baby, will you be my girl  
Kristi, will you be my girl  
I'll take you to a better place,  
There's no pain and no disgrace in a perfect world  
  
We'll drive that ragtop cadillac  
We'll drive that ragtop cadillac  
Straight across the nevada line  
Radio playin' hair flying  
No turning back  
  
Chorus  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Baby, I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
For a moment times stands still  
For a moment times stands still  
I feel no shame, I feel no violence  
For the moment and in the silence  
I feel that peace.  
  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Baby, I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
Solo  
  
Sun rises in the east  
Sun rises in the east  
For a moment in your eyes,  
I catch a glimpse of a different life  
Smile at fate  
  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Hey babe, I live for times like these  
Baby, I live for times like these  
Give me a reason to believe  
  
There's no famous final scene, no movie starts  
No limousines, everything we'll leave behind  
There's no waiting on the other side  
Just you and me for a better place  
I swear I live for times like these  
You're all I need  
That's all I need  
You're all I need

I'm uneducated  
My clothes outdated  
I'm not politically correct  
  
I still hate small talk  
And fast cars and hard rock  
Still adds up my?  
  
I should be expressing  
All my inner repression  
I guess depression's now a cultural thing  
  
My record company says  
Blow my brains out my head  
I make the cover of every magazine  
  
[Chorus]  
Step inside my nightmare  
Welcome to my trip  
I cannot pretend and I will not defend  
Why this good old boy's so tragically unhip  
  
I still like bad girls  
Who rock me hard in my world  
Its monkey see and monkey do  
When I'm?  
  
I got an old waterbed  
I like to trip into the dead  
I've keep a poster of Kiss on my wall  
  
I still curse, smoke, drink and toke  
And make love in the back of my car  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I like that home grown  
Mind blowing  
You're bringing  
Are rolling  
  
They see strange stalking  
Mind stopping  
Ass swinging  
Street walking  
Floozies  
  
[Chorus]

What's got you so jumpy?  
Why can't you sit still, yeah?  
Like gasoline you want to pump me  
And leave me when you get your fill, yeah  
Every time I touch you honey you get hot  
I want to make love you never stop  
Come up for air you push me to the floor  
What's been going on in that head of yours  
  
[Chorus]  
Unskinny bop  
Just blows me away  
Unskinny bop, bop  
All night and day  
Unskinny bop, bop, bop, bop  
She just loves to play  
Unskinny bop nothin' more to say  
  
You look at me so funny  
Love bite got you acting oh so strange  
You got too many bees in your honey  
Am I just another word in your page, yeah, yeah  
Every time I touch you honey you get hot  
I want to make love you never stop  
Come up for air you push me to the floor  
What's been going on in that head of yours  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're sayin' my love won't do ya  
But that ain't love written on your face  
Well honey I can see right through ya  
We'll see whose ridin' who at the end of the race  
  
What's right  
What's wrong  
What's left  
What the hell is going on  
  
[Chorus]

Lately I can tell that something ain't right  
I don't see the fire when I look in your eyes  
One time up, and the next time down  
This may be the last time that you see me around, said  
  
Well it sure seems to me nothing matters tonight  
And all those things we worked out, they got lost in the fight  
It's not enough, girl, that I gave you my soul  
I just want to know if we've got anything left at all, and I say  
  
Hold on now, baby.  
This could be the last time we stand  
This could be the last time that we say good-bye  
The picture shatters  
I can't find the words to save it  
Tell me what to do, how can I make it right  
We will always be fire and ice  
  
Well promises made in the heat of the night  
You could sure spit them out, girl, but they've long passed me by  
Nobody knows about the show you put me through  
This could be the last time that I get through to you  
  
Hold on now, baby.  
This could be the last time we stand  
This could be the last time that we say good-bye  
The picture shatters  
I can't find the words to save it  
Tell me what to do, how can I make it right  
We will always be fire and ice  
  
Well I can't stand to see no more damage done  
But you'll never understand until you suffer some, and I said  
  
Hold on now, baby.  
This could be the last time we stand  
This could be the last time that we say good-bye  
The picture shatters  
I can't find the words to save it  
Tell me what to do, how can I make it right  
We will always be fire and ice

(here it comes)  
Well funky monkey's in the jungle tonight  
They got two by two don't hear me right  
  
Band playing loudly baby  
Gone are the days when the days gone  
I said gone  
  
When the monkeys are gone  
Gone or dead this is what they said  
  
Chorus  
Lost Mary  
Cries, cries, cries  
Yeah she does, yeah baby, that is what she did  
Lions sleeps, baby  
The lamb surely dies (??)  
I just don't want to fuck you  
  
That's it  
  
When the jungle sleeps  
Is when the monkey shine  
I said you do baby? Don't mind  
  
Back? Are wild  
If the deuces left in than the deuces are wild  
  
I said baby, well,  
  
Chorus  
Lost Mary  
Cries, cries, cries  
Yeah?  
Lions sleeps, baby  
Dies, dies, dies  
I just don't want to fuck you  
  
Ooooh, kick it!  
  
Solo  
  
Give me some of that  
  
Well dime store cowboy shoot your gun  
Knock them mother fuckers down one by one  
  
Money on up it's in your face  
Gimme no lip or get your face back here  
  
Ooh, got it right  
  
When the monkey don't sleep  
And the money don't shine  
Well, ??  
  
Chorus

I hit the highway  
Touch life barely sixteen  
No angel of mercy  
Coming down to save the soul of me  
  
I took a Greyhound limousine  
Straight to grand central NYC  
It was ass, gas, or grass, living fast  
Nobody rides for free  
  
[Chorus]  
Living it up, giving it up  
Living in the valley of lost souls  
Wanting it all, taking the fall  
Living in the valley of lost souls  
  
Miss Misery come ride me  
How I love her company  
She did Boston justice  
And wronged all the right out of me  
  
The devil wears a black suit  
He says I'm livin' like a bum  
So what I'm looking like I'm half dead  
A gypsy on the run  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Feels like time's running out on me  
But I wasn't born to play nobody's fool  
Ain't nobody gonna hold me down to play nobody's fool  
Ain't nobody gonna hold me down  
I've gotta roll, roll, roll, roll, roll, roll  
  
Somebody save me

Alone on my steel horse I ride  
The engine echoes in the night  
Through a concrete jungle a wasteland i call home  
No fears and no regrets  
No apologies for the things I've said  
And believe me child it's the life I've known  
  
I will ride on through the night  
From this hell I will survive  
It's all I've done, it's who I am  
Just know this  
I've done the best I can  
  
I see fallen angels and broken dreams  
I'm still surviving on these streets  
Like forgotten soldiers left here to die  
All your pain I understand  
Give me your love, you take my hand  
And from this wasteland we will ride  
  
We will ride on through the night  
From this hell we will survive  
Give me your faith give me your hand  
All I know we've done the best we can  
  
I will ride on through the night  
From this hell I will survive  
It's all I've done, it's who I am  
Just know this  
I've done the best I can  
  
We will ride on through the night  
From this hell we will survive  
Give me your faith give me your hand  
All I know we've done the best we can

Came to Hollywood  
Gonna be a movie star  
She got off the bus  
But she didn't get far  
Now she can act as good as Meryl Streep  
Dreams of stardom when she sleeps  
The casting couch just makes her scream  
Wasn't like this in her dream  
  
[Chorus]  
Wishful thinking  
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me good!  
Wishful thinking yeah yeah  
Let's go  
  
Came to Hollywood  
Gonna be a big rock star  
He can play a million riffs on this here guitar  
Now he works two jobs, can't get a break  
Takes little white pills to stay awake  
No record deals just make him scream  
It wasn't like this in his dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
(come on Bobby)  
(Yeah, I like that)  
  
Hollywood  
Superstars  
Rock n' roll Denny's  
Topless bars  
Do a porno movie, make some extra cash  
But you spend it all too fast  
Hollywood just make you scream  
It wasn't like this in your dream  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Dream, wishful thinking  
Give it to me, give it to me, give it to me, give it to me good  
Wishful thinking yeah yeah  
Let's go

[Chorus]  
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll  
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll  
But when evening comes around and it's time to hit the town  
Where do you go  
You gotta rock it  
  
The old folks say that you gotta end your date by ten  
But if you're out on a date don't you bring her home late 'cause it's a sin  
You know there's no excuse, you know you're gonna lose, you never win  
I'll say it again  
  
And it's all because  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Everyone gather round let me tell you all about it  
You see I pulled into a drive-in and I found a place to park  
We hopped into the backseat where it's always nice and dark  
We're just about to move thinkin' "Bret, this is a breeze"  
There's a light in my eye and a guy says "Out of the car, long hair!"  
  
Oowee, you're coming with me  
Said the local police  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Play me a little C.C.  
  
Your Mama don't dance, no  
She just don't dance, no  
Your Mama don't dance and your Daddy don't rock and roll  
Ah, yeah
