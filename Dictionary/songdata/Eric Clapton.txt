God's got a plan, he's making it clear  
Sweet little love song in your ear  
Like hearts made of diamond, love will prevail  
Put a little wind in your sail  
  
[Chorus:]  
I'd do anything, anything you can dream of  
I'd do anything, anything for your love  
For your love  
For your love  
  
Listen now baby, I'll tell you true  
Just how much that I love you  
I got a sweet feelin' I know is real  
This kind of love you can't conceal  
  
[Chorus: x2]

(feat. J. J. Cale)  
  
Some like this and some like that  
And some don't know where it's at  
If you don't get loose, if you don't groove  
Well, your motor won't make it and your motor won't move  
  
If time don't tell you then don't ask me  
I'm riding on a hurricane down to the sea  
If you can't hear the music, turn it up loud  
There's movement in the air and movement in the crowd  
  
Bow-legged woman doing the boogaloo  
She got a jive, she got a move  
Turn around, do it again  
Bow-legged woman, where you been  
  
Fat jack owns a honky-tonk downtown  
You can catch a woman if you hang around  
You can tear down the door, tear down the wall  
Fat jack he don't care at all  
  
Easy come, easy go  
Any way the wind blows  
Hey, drummer, drummer, can you give me that beat  
Can you give me that beat, got to move my feet  
  
Guitar player been all around the world  
But he can't play a lick for looking at the girls  
One two three four five six seven  
Well, you'd better change your ways or you won't get to heaven  
  
Eight nine ten, gonna stop at eleven  
Eleven just lays around with seven  
Some like this and some like that  
And some don't know where it's at  
  
If you don't get loose, if you don't groove  
Well, your motor won't make it and your motor won't move  
Easy come, easy go  
Any way the wind blows

I've been on the road too long  
Moving in the wrong direction  
I don't know where I belong  
I don't know what I will do if I can't get  
Back home  
  
Troubles I got all my own  
They don't fit no other person  
The memories keep rolling on  
And I don't know what I will do if I can't get  
Back home  
  
I don't fit, but I don't give a damn  
I won't quit, cause I know who I am  
And I'll admit, that I've been on the left  
  
Bit by bit, I'll review my plan  
This is it, I'll do the best I can  
Trust and understand  
  
Cause I know that I am loved  
Cause I'll be on my way  
Got no need to stay 'round here  
  
Cause I been on this road too long  
Going in the wrong direction  
And I don't know where I've come from  
All I know is I will die if I don't get  
Back home

[Chorus:]  
I'm just a bad boy,  
Long long ways from home.  
I'm just a bad boy,  
Long long ways from home.  
But I ain't got nobody  
To bury me when I'm dead and gone.  
  
Well I'm the cat that scratches  
And I'm like a dog that bites.  
I'll be your box of matches, baby,  
When you need a light.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I used to have a little girl,  
Only 16 years old,  
But her mom and dad put me way out,  
Way out in the cold.  
  
I can't stay here no longer,  
My luck is running slow.  
Gotta keep on moving  
But I ain't got no place to go.  
  
[Chorus]

You use me to get you anything you wanted.  
Oh, but I'm a changed man now, baby,  
And your other friend can get you what you want now.  
If I go through those same things again,  
I'll be worse off than I started.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Girl, you're such a bad influence  
And you've got ways to make me do what you want.  
Girl, you're such a bad influence,  
I've got to stay away.  
  
I've been hurt in all of the worst kind of ways,  
And it's you pretty baby,  
I've just got to stay away from.  
I won't go through those same things again,  
I'm so glad that we parted.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Somebody please, you've got to help me break away.  
You know I don't like this lonely feeling.  
It wasn't meant to be this way.  
I won't go through those same things again,  
I'm so glad we parted.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You're such a bad influence,  
And I have got to stay away.  
You're such a bad influence,  
I've got to stay away from you, baby.  
I've got to stay away.

Oh what a feeling I get when I'm with you  
You take my heart into everything you do  
And it makes me sad for the lonely people  
I walked that road for so long  
Now I know that I'm one of the lucky people  
Your love is making me strong  
  
[Chorus:]  
I've had enough bad love  
I need something I can be proud of  
I've had enough bad love  
No more bad love  
  
And now I see that my life has been so blue  
With all the heartaches I had till I met you  
But I'm glad to say now that's all behind me  
With you here by my side  
And there's no more memories to remind me  
Your love will keep me alive  
  
[Chorus: x3]

Where is the sun,  
The sun that used to shine on me?  
Where has it gone  
Or is it just a memory?  
  
I looked through the window,  
Staring at the sky,  
Waiting for a moment  
That always passed me by.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Black summer rain,  
Black summer rain,  
Black summer rain is falling on me, girl.  
  
Where is the love,  
The love I need to set me free?  
And how can I escape  
This gloom that is swallowing me?  
  
[Chorus: x2]

When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
When the sun rose this morning  
I didn't have my baby by my side  
I don't know where she was  
I know she's out with some another guy  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
Don't the sun look lonesome  
Shadin' down behind the trees?  
But don't your house look lonesome  
When your baby's packed to leave?  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Blow wind, blow wind  
Blow my baby back to me  
Well you know if I don't soon find her, I will be in misery  
Goodbye baby that is all I have left to say  
Ohh, goodbye baby, that is all I have left to say  
But you have lost your good thing  
Go ahead and have your own way  

Don't take the wrong direction passing through  
Instead of deep reflection of what's true  
For it's a combination of judgments made by you  
That cause a deep dejection all the way through  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition  
  
Early rising every day  
You must be enterprising in your way  
For you will hear no laughter, nor see the sun  
Life would be one disaster all the way through  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition  
  
Don't take the wrong direction passing through  
Instead of deep reflection of what's true  
For it's a combination of judgments made by you  
That cause a deep dejection all the way through  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition  
  
No relaxation, no conversation, no variation  
In a very dark blue, blue condition

I thought that you'd be loving me  
I thought you were the one who'd stay forever  
But now forever has come and gone  
And I'm still here alone  
Cause you were only playing  
You were only playing with my heart  
I was never waiting  
I was never waiting for the tears to start  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me  
It was you who made the tears fall down  
It was you who broke my heart in pieces  
It was, it was you who made my blue eyes blue  
  
Oh, I never should've trusted you  
  
I thought that I'd be all you need  
In your eyes I thought I saw my heaven  
And now my heaven's gone away  
And I'm out in the cold  
Cause you had me believing  
You had me believing in a lie  
Guess I couldn't see it  
Guess I couldn't see it 'til I saw "Good-bye"  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me  
It was you who made the tears fall down  
It was you who broke my heart in pieces  
It was, it was you who made my blue eyes blue  
  
Oh, I never should've trusted you  
  
Cause you were only playing,  
You were only playing with my heart.  
I was never waiting, I was never waiting for the tears to start.  
  
It was you who put the clouds around me.  
It was you who, it was you who put those clouds around me.  
It was you who made the tears fall down.  
Only you, who broke my heart in pieces.  
It was you, it was you who made my blue eyes blue.  
  
Oh, I never should've trusted you. [Repeat x4]

I have the blues before sunrise,  
Tears standing in my eyes.  
I have the blues before sunrise,  
Tears standing in my eyes.  
It was a miserable feeling, now babe,  
A feeling I do despise.  
  
I have to leave, leave you baby,  
Because you know you done me wrong.  
I have to leave you baby,  
Because you know you done me wrong.  
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling  
And break up my happy home.  
  
I have to leave, leave you baby,  
I'm gonna leave you all alone.  
I'm gonna leave you baby,  
I'm gonna leave you all alone.  
I'm gonna pack up and leave you darling  
Because you know you done me wrong.  
  
Well now goodbye, goodbye baby,  
I'll see you on some rainy day.  
Well now goodbye baby,  
I'll see you on some rainy day.  
You can go ahead now little darling,  
'Cause I want you to have your way.

Blues, blues trying to drive me away from home.  
Blues, blues trying to drive me away from home.  
Had the blues so bad, blues followed me all day long.  
  
Blues, blues won't let me take my rest.  
Blues, blues won't let me take my rest.  
My mind is rambling like a wild geese out in the west.  
  
Well, you're my all day steady, baby you're my midnight dream.  
Yes, you're my all day steady, baby you're my midnight dream.  
I love that woman better than anyone I've ever seen.  
  
Blues, blues follow me all day long.  
Blues, blues follow me all day long.  
Blues, blues won't you please leave me alone.

Boom, boom, boom, boom  
I'm gonna shoot you right down  
Knock you off of your feet  
And take you home with me  
Put you in my house  
Boom, boom, boom, boom  
  
Boom, boom, boom, boom  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
I love to see you strut  
When you're walking to me  
When you're talking to me  
That knocks me out  
  
Boom, boom, boom, boom  
You know I like it like that  
With your baby-talk  
Oh and the way that you walk  
You know it knocks me right down  
Knocks me off of my feet  
  
Boom, boom, boom, boom  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Oh, oh, oh, oh  
How, how, how, how  
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah  
Now, now, now, now

In the lonely night  
In the blinking stardust of a pale blue light  
You're comin' through to me in black and white  
When we were made of dreams.  
You're blowing down the shaky street  
You're hearing my heart beat  
In the record breaking heat  
Where we were born in time.  
Not one more night not one more kiss  
Not this time baby no more of this  
Takes too much skill takes too much will  
It's revealing.  
You came you saw, just like the law  
You married young, just like your ma,  
You tried and tried, you made me slide  
You left me reelin' with this feelin'.  
On the rising curve  
Where the ways of nature will test every nerve,  
You won't get anything you don't deserve  
Where we were born in time.  
You pressed me once, you pressed me twice,  
You hang the flame, you'll pay the price,  
Oh babe, that fire  
Is still smokin'.  
You were snow, you were rain  
You were striped, you were plain,  
Oh babe, truer words  
Have not been spoken or broken.  
In the hills of mystery,  
In the foggy web of destiny,  
You can have what's left of me,  
Where we were born in time.

Well I just don't get it  
Can't make the pieces fit  
I might just as well forget it  
But my heart won't let me quit  
  
You say it's only a part of love  
That's right  
But I get a little worried sometimes  
When I start to lose  
Tired of holding it together  
When I know I'm going to blow another fuse  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm at my breaking point  
My breaking point  
I'm at my breaking point  
My breaking point  
  
Well you're never gonna get it  
If you don't get up and try  
Try and spread those wings around me  
Honey let me see you fly  
  
You say it's only a part of love  
That's right  
But I get a little worried sometimes  
When I start to lose  
Tired of holding it together  
When I know I'm going to blow another fuse  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Maybe someday you'll recover  
I can see it in your eyes  
One more thing that you'll discover  
That you'll finally realize

Everything was wonderful when you were in my life.  
Yesterday we were on a roll, baby, then we end up in a fight.  
Everywhere I look, I see problems, where I never seen before.  
The cracks in the sidewalk, when I get home my key don't even fit the door.  
  
[Chorus:]  
The moon don't shine, it's broken down.  
The clouds are crying, they're broken down.  
The car won't start, it's broken down.  
And this shattered heart, it's broken down.  
My whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
  
Stepped outside into the night, I took a walk around the block.  
I stopped by the church that I used to go inside but even that door was
locked.  
So I came back home, feeling so alone, a light had burned out in the hall.  
My TV is broke, said I'm out of smoke, there's no one I can even call.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Said my whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
  
Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.  
Till you come back, come back to me, I'm going to be broken down.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I mean my whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, I've broken down.  
My whole damn world, it's broken down.  
Since you left me girl, it's broken down.

They call me the breeze,  
I keep blowing down the road  
They call me the breeze,  
I keep blowing down the road  
I ain't got me nobody,  
I ain't carrying me no load  
Ain't no change in the weather,  
Ain't no change in me  
Ain't no change in the weather,  
  
Ain't no change in me  
I ain't hidin' from nobody,  
Ain't nobody hidin' from me  
I got that green light, babe,  
I got to keep moving on  
I got that green light, babe,  
I got to keep moving on  
I might go out to California,  
Might go down to Georgia,  
Might stay home

Little man with his eyes on fire  
And his smile so bright.  
In his hands are the toys you gave  
To fill his heart with delight.  
  
[Chorus:]  
And in the ring stands a circus clown  
Holding up a knife.  
What you see and what you will hear  
Will last you for the rest of your life.  
  
And it's sad so sad  
There ain't no easy way round.  
And it's sad so sad  
All you friends gather round  
'Cause the circus left town.  
  
Little man with his heart so pure  
And his love so fine.  
Stick with me and I'll ride with you  
Till the end of the line.  
  
Hold my hand and I'll walk with you  
Through the darkest night.  
When I smile I'll be thinking of you  
And every little thing will be all right.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
The circus left town, left town.  
The circus left town, left town

You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
Ah, the woman I love, took from my best friend  
Some joker got lucky, stole her back again  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
Oh ah, she's gone, know she won't come back  
I've taken the last nickel out of her nation sack  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
When a woman gets in trouble, everybody throws her down  
Lookin' for her good friend, none can be found  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
Winter time's comin', it's gon' be slow  
You can't make the winter, babe, just drive a little slow  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  
You better come on in my kitchen  
It's goin' to be rainin' outdoors  

I'm gonna love you, like nobody's loved you  
Come rain or come shine  
High as a mountain and deep as a river  
Come rain or come shine  
  
Well, I guess when you met me  
That it was just one of those things  
But don't you ever bet me  
'Cause I'm gonna be true if you let me  
  
Oh, you're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
Won't that be fine  
  
Day may be cloudy or sunny  
We're either in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine  
  
You're gonna love me, like nobody's loved me  
Come rain or come shine  
Happy together, unhappy together  
Won't that be fine  
  
Day may be cloudy or sunny  
We're in or out of the money  
But I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or shine  
  
Rain or shine  
I'm with you always  
I'm with you rain or whine

She took my hand  
And tried to make me understand  
That she would always be there  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today,  
I'm such a lonely man.  
  
It came as no surprise to me  
That she'd leave me in misery.  
It seemed like only yesterday  
She made a vow that she'd never walk away.  
  
She took my hand  
And tried to make me understand  
That she would always be there  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today,  
I'm such a lonely man.  
  
And if it seemed a sin  
To love another man's woman, baby,  
I guess I'll keep on sinning  
Loving her, Lord, till my very last day.  
  
But I looked away  
And she ran away from me today,  
I'm such a lonely man.

I want a little girl, call my own.  
She must be someone who's all alone now.  
Say, I want a little girl to fall in love with me, oh yeah.  
  
I want a little girl, but she may not look  
Just like a picture in a story book.  
If she can cook chicken, yeah, she'll suit me to a T.  
  
And she don't have to wave her hair  
Or even wear fancy clothes, I wouldn't even care.  
She don't wear nylon hose, oh.  
  
I want a little girl to love a lot.  
You know that I'd give her everything I got.  
I want a little girl to fall in love with me.

Blue sky upon the horizon,  
Private eye is on my trail,  
And if I don't be there by morning  
You know that I must have spent the night in jail.  
  
I've been running from Memphis to L. A.  
Had an appointment set sometime for today,  
And if I don't be there by morning  
You know that I must have gone the other way.  
  
Finding my way back to you girl,  
Lonely and blue and mistreated too.  
Sometimes I think of you girl,  
Is it true that you think of me too?  
  
I got a woman living in L. A.  
I got a woman waiting for my pay,  
And if I don't be there by morning,  
Pack my clothes, get down on your knees and pray.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I left my woman with a twenty dollar bill.  
I left her waiting, I hope she's waiting for me still.  
If I don't be there by morning  
You know that I, I never will.

If I had possession over judgement day  
If I had possession over judgement day  
Lord, the little woman I'm lovin' wouldn't have no right to pray  
And I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see  
And I went to the mountain, far as my eyes could see  
Man got my woman and the 'a lonesome blues got me  
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long  
And I rolled and I tumbled and I cried the whole night long  
Boy, I woke up this mornin', my biscuit roller gone  
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away  
I didn't like the way she done  
Had to fold my arms and I slowly walked away  
And I said in my mind, yo' trouble gon' come someday  
And now run here, baby, set down on my knee  
Oh now run here, baby, set down on my knee  
I wanna tell you all about the way they treated me  

[Chorus]  
(Well) I'm goin' left  
'Til you lead me to the right  
Lead me to what is right  
I'm goin' left  
'Til you lead me to the right  
Lead me to what is right  
  
There's a train people say  
I could ride to get my whole life straight  
But the bridge on the way  
Has a toll too much for me to pay  
Yes I know it must be  
What I chose could mean my destiny  
Lights are green all is go  
But my heart keeps telling my mind no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's a plane over there  
Where all are given even share  
What you get is so small  
It's like never having nothing at all  
Take my hand says a friend  
A will stick with you until the end  
But I'm in doubt I must decline  
'Cause even friends can change their lines  
  
[Chorus]

You know it ain't right just to treat me this a way.  
Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me this a way.  
Well, you know, my baby, have you home one day.  
  
You know it ain't right just to treat me like you do.  
Well, you know it ain't right just to treat me like you do.  
Well, you know, my baby, coming home to you.  
  
You know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long.  
Well, you know it ain't right, baby, stay out all night long.  
Well, you know, my baby, you done something wrong.

So you think you are something special  
I wonder why, baby, is that so  
Could admit, you are something special  
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know  
  
Yes, I've seen you with your other girlfriends  
I can tell they really think you're fine  
And I've seen you with your other men friends  
They don't know if you're a love of mine  
  
[Chorus:]  
It all depends on how you feel, baby.  
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.  
It all depends on how you feel, baby.  
I've got to know just how you feel, baby.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause you've taken away  
The only thing I ever ever had.  
Don't you know that I love you?  
Why'd you make me feel bad?  
'Cause the only thing I ever loved  
Was loving you.  
  
So you think you are something special  
I wonder why, baby, is that so  
Could admit, you are something special  
Won't you tell me, girl? I'd love to know  
  
[Chorus]  
  
So you think you are something special...  
  
What makes you think you are something special?

If you need a woman in bed with you  
Tell her in front what you can do  
It's easy, easy as pie  
Don't have to be a ?  
You don't have to lie  
  
If you play the guitar it won't be long  
You'd be writing and singing, them songs  
It's easy, easy you bet  
And you've been bet, if you don't quit  
  
If you feel kinda lonesome, a friend's inside  
Get yourself a dog and be alright  
Get yourself too, lucky me  
Now one thing nice, I'll be there twice to love you  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
If you wanna think she's ugly and always depressed  
She can go out and buy herself a new dress  
It's easy, easy for her  
Solves all of her problems, that's for sure  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
If she cashes your property, you might regret  
Use that old plastic, swipe deeper in debt  
It's easy, easy you see  
If tomorrow never comes, everything is free  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine  
  
It's so easy gettin' through these times  
So easy your love and mine

It's too late, she's gone.  
It's too late, my baby's gone.  
Wish I had told her she was my only one.  
It's too late, she's gone.  
  
It's a woman that cries,  
So I guess I've gotta hide my eyes.  
Yes, I will miss her more than anyone.  
It's too late, she's gone.  
  
She's gone, yes she's gone.  
She's gone, my baby's gone.  
She's gone, yes she's gone.  
Where can my baby be?  
  
And I wonder does she know  
When she left me, it hurt me so.  
I need your love babe, please don't make me wait.  
Tell me it's not too late.

Third Verse

[Chorus:]  
Just like a prisoner,  
He don't know right from wrong.  
Just like a baby,  
He sings a pleading song  
  
And that's why  
So many tears must fall.  
Yes, that's why  
So many tears must fall.  
  
Just like a sailor,  
He steers away from home.  
He feels a tidal wave  
In his heart, but he ain't alone  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'm like that prisoner,  
I don't know right from wrong.  
Just like that baby,  
I sing a pleading song  
  
And that's why  
You'll never know how I feel.  
Yes, that's why  
You'll never know how I feel.

I never realized that you were in pain.  
I wanna help you honey, let me see you again.  
Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough.  
Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love.  
  
Put a smile on your face and dry away your tears.  
Life is bound to get better as you live your years.  
Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough.  
Life is so bad, baby, when I find the key to love.  
  
Somewhere in this world, the one you waited for  
Come along and find you, turn the key your door.  
Hurts my soul, babe, when I find you feeling rough.  
Life is so bad, baby, when you find the key to love.

I've got the key to the highway  
Billed out and bound to go  
Gonna leave here runnin'  
Walkin's most too slow  
  
I'm goin' back to the border  
Baby, where I'm better known  
Because you haven't done nothin', baby  
But drive a good man from home  
  
When the moon beats on the mountain  
Little girl, I'll be on my way  
I'm gonna roam this highway  
Until the break of day  
  
Oh, give me one more kiss darlin'  
Just before I go  
'Cos when I leave this time, little girl  
I won't be back no more  
  
I got the key  
(I got the key)  
To the highway  
(To the highway)  
  
Billed out and bound to go  
(I gotta go, I gotta go)  
I'm gonna leave here runnin'  
Walkin's most too slow

I got a kind-hearted woman  
Studies evil all the time  
I got a kind-hearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
You would do to quit me  
Just to have it on your mind  
  
I got a kind-hearted woman  
Do anything in this world for me  
I got a kind-hearted woman  
Do anything in this world for me  
Lord, these evil-hearted women  
Lord, they will not let me be  
  
Ain't but one thing  
Makes Mr. Johnson drink  
Swear 'bout how you treat me, baby  
I begin to think  
  
Oh, baby  
My life don't feel the same  
You break my heart  
When you call Mr. So-And-So's name  
  
She's a kind-hearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
She's a kind-hearted woman  
She studies evil all the time  
You wish to quit me, baby  
Just to have it on your mind

Ma, take this badge off of me  
I can't use it any more  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
[Chorus]  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
  
Ma, take these guns away from me  
I can't shoot them any more  
There's a long black cloud following me  
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock, knock, knockin'  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
  
Ma, take this badge off of me  
I can't use it any more  
It's getting dark, too dark to see  
Feel like I'm knockin' on heaven's door  
  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door  
Knock, knock, knockin' on heavens door

If you cry about a nickel, you'll die about a dime  
She wouldn't cry, but your money won't mine

And that thing don't keep-a ringin' so soon, good Lord  
On that Gulfport Island Road  

Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.  
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.  
She's gone away and left me, that makes me feel so bad.  
  
It's early in the morning and my love is coming down to you.  
It's early in the morning and my love is coming down to you.  
I'll love you, love you, baby, till I don't know what to do.  
  
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.  
Last night, I lost the best friend I ever had.  
Now you've gone away and left me, that makes me feel so bad.

There is nothing that is wrong  
In wanting you to stay here with me.  
I know you've got somewhere to go,  
But won't you make yourself at home and stay with me?  
And don't you ever leave.  
  
[Chorus:]  
Lay down, Sally, and rest you in my arms.  
Don't you think you want someone to talk to?  
Lay down, Sally, no need to leave so soon.  
I've been trying all night long just to talk to you.  
  
The sun ain't nearly on the rise  
And we still got the moon and stars above.  
Underneath the velvet skies,  
Love is all that matters. Won't you stay with me?  
And don't you ever leave.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I long to see the morning light  
Coloring your face so dreamily.  
So don't you go and say goodbye,  
You can lay your worries down and stay with me.  
And don't you ever leave.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

What'll you do when you get lonely  
And nobody's waiting by your side?  
You've been running and hiding much too long.  
You know it's just your foolish pride.  
  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.  
  
I tried to give you consolation  
When your old man had let you down.  
Like a fool, I fell in love with you,  
Turned my whole world upside down.  
  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.  
  
Let's make the best of the situation  
Before I finally go insane.  
Please don't say I'll never find a way  
And tell me all my love's in vain.  
  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.  
  
Layla, you've got me on my knees.  
Layla, I'm begging, darling please.  
Layla, darling won't you ease my worried mind.

Tell me anything you think I want to hear  
Just to keep me standin' here  
To secure your shaky fears  
  
Tell me you love me, but in your heart you know you don't  
So you lie 'cause you think I want  
To make believe you love when you don't  
  
Lead me on, lead me on  
Lead me on, lead me on  
I'll play along and along and along  
Baby lead me on  
Lead me on  
  
Pretend it's rainin' when the tears flow from my eyes  
And you're warm when you're cold as ice  
And everything's gonna be alright  
  
And it's a shame, little Johnny wears my name  
And you know I'm not the one  
Still you say he is my son  
  
Chorus  
  
And when I leave to go work for you  
You cry you're lonely too  
To make me feel your love is true  
  
But in your dreams you slip and tell it all  
I hear you calling out his name  
You say you love him loud and plain  
  
Chorus

Standing at the crossroads, trying to read the signs  
To tell me which way I should go to find the answer,  
And all the time I know,  
Plant your love and let it grow  
  
[Chorus]  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, let it grow  
  
Looking for a reason to check out of my mind,  
Trying hard to get a friend that I can count on,  
But there's nothing left to show,  
Plant your love and let it grow  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, so let it grow, let it grow  
  
Time is getting shorter and there's much for you to do  
Only ask and you will get what you are needing,  
The rest is up to you  
Plant your love and let it grow  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, let it  
  
Let it grow, let it grow,  
Let it blossom, let it flow  
In the sun, the rain, the snow,  
Love is lovely, let it grow

She is a little Queen of Spades  
And her men will not let her be  
Says, she's the little Queen of Spades  
And her men will not let her be  
Ev'ry time she makes a spread  
Hoo, fair brown, cold chills run all over me  
I'm gonna get me a gamblin' woman  
If it's the last thing that I do  
Gonna get me a gamblin' woman  
If it's the last thing that I do  
Man don't need a woman  
Hoo, fair brown, that he got to give all of his money to  
Everybody said, you got a mojo  
'Coz baby you've been using that stuff  
Everybody said, she got a mojo  
Baby, you've been using that stuff  
She got a way of trimmin' down  
Hoo, fair brown, and I mean it's most too tough  
Little girl, since I am the King  
Baby, and you is a Queen  
Little girl, since I am the King  
Baby, and you is a Queen  
Let's us put our heads together  
Hoo, fair brown, then we make our money green  

Well she's walking through the clouds  
With a circus mind that's running 'round.  
Butterflies and zebras, fairy tales,  
That's all she ever thinks about.  
  
When I'm sad she comes to me  
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free.  
Said, "It's all right, take anything you want,  
Anything you want, anything."  
  
Well she's walking through the clouds  
With a circus mind that's running 'round.  
Butterflies and zebras, fairy tales,  
That's all she ever thinks about.  
  
When I'm sad she comes to me  
With a thousand smiles she gives to me free.  
Said, "It's all right, take anything you want,  
Anything you want, anything."  
  
Fly on, little wing.

Out on an open highway,  
Such a lovely day but something's wrong.  
Something, something's gotta be wrong.  
  
I just left home this morning,  
This old road keeps rolling on and on.  
Rolling, rolling on and on.  
  
Won't somebody help me?  
Won't somebody help me?  
Won't somebody help me?  
  
I've never been so lonesome and long way from home,  
Never been lonesome and long way,  
Never been lonesome and long way from home.  
  
[Bridge]  
  
[Chorus]

Sometimes a girl  
Will come and go  
You reach for love  
But life wont let ya know  
That in the end  
You'll still be loving her  
But then shes gone  
You're all alone  
  
Sign of pain  
Is on my face, well  
My heart beat stops  
But I wont take the blame, no no  
I gave her all the love I had within  
My love was strong  
Something went wrong, no! no!  
  
It takes a fool to learn  
Yes sir  
That love don't love nobody  
Love love love love love love  
It takes a fool to learn  
Yes it does, girl  
That love don't love no one  
That love don't love no one  
It takes a fool to learn  
Stop to think about it, well  
That love don't love nobody  
Oh! Oh no!  
It takes a fool to learn  
When you're down and out, shout about it  
That love don't love no more  
Tell the world, oh babe  
No more  
  
Oh, babe  
It takes a fool to learn  
Gotta be more careful about myself  
That love don't love nobody  
It takes a fool to learn  
Whoa baby, took me a long time to learn, to learn, well  
  
That love don't love no one  
It takes a fool to learn  
I was a fool, you were a fool  
That love don't love nobody  
Now we got love, we need love  
It takes a fool to learn

I remember yet before we met  
When every night and day  
I had to live the life of a lonely one.  
And I remember meeting you,  
Discovering love could be so true  
When shared by two, 'stead of only one.  
  
When you said you loved me  
We could not be parted.  
Said, I built my world around you  
And I'm truly glad I found you  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
I never felt so good before.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
Yes it has, you know it has.  
  
Each night I pray we'll never part  
Because the love within my heart  
Grows stronger from day to day.  
Best I try, hard I try  
To reassure and satisfy.  
You know I'd be lost if you went away.  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
Yes it has, I know it has.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
  
Because loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
I never felt so good before.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
Yes it has, you know it has.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.  
Don't you know my baby there.  
Loving you has made my life sweeter than ever.

My heart was leaping in the sun  
My friends all say that you're the one  
Let me get this one thing very clear  
There ain't enough going on down here  
  
Mainline Florida, oh say  
Mainline Florida, O.K.  
  
Her arms were open, open wide  
Her invitation's a changing tide  
I could remember not long ago  
We took a cruise down on Hotel Row  
  
Mainline Florida, oh say  
Mainline Florida, O.K.  
  
Her arms were open, open wide  
Her invitation's a changing tide  
I could remember not long ago  
We took a cruise down on old Hotel Row  
  
Mainline Florida, oh say  
Mainline Florida, O.K.

Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door  
Early this mornin', when you knocked upon my door  
And I said, "Hello, Satan, I believe it's time to go"  
Me and the Devil, was walkin' side by side  
Me and the Devil, was walkin' side by side  
I'm goin' to beat my woman, until I get satisfied  
She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round  
Now, baby, you know you ain't doin' me right, now  
She say you don't see why, that I will dog her 'round  
It must be that old evil spirit, so deep down in the ground  
You may bury my body down by the highway side  
I don't care where you bury my body when I'm dead and gone  
You may bury my body down by the highway side  
So my old evil spirit can take the Greyhound bus and ride  

Tell me, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you?  
Ooh, milkcow, what on earth is wrong with you?  
Now, you have a little calf, hoo hoo, and your milk is turnin' blue  
Oh, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck  
Now, your calf is hungry, I believe he needs a suck  
But your milk is turnin' blue, hoo hoo, I believe he's outta luck  
Now, I feel like milkin' and my cow won't come  
I feel like churnin' it and my milk won't turn  
I'm cryin', please, please, don't do me wrong  
If you see my milk cow, baby, now how, please, drive her home  
But my milkcow been ramblin', hoo hee, for miles around  
But my milkcow been ramblin', hoo hoo, for miles around  
Well, now how can you suck on some other man's bull cow?  
Hoo hoo, in this strange man's town  

[Chorus:]  
She's a modern girl in a modern world  
Where only the strong can survive.  
Too many dreams have been laid at her door,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
Where would you fit in the scheme of her day  
And where could you fit in her heart?  
Trying to be small will get you nowhere at all,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
Don't throw your love away.  
  
She moves through your life like a warm summer breeze,  
And nothing will stand in her way.  
The sound of her voice brings your heart to its knees,  
But the modern girl will ride on, oh oh oh.  
  
[Chorus: x2]

By jack bruce  
  
Driving in my car, smoking my cigar,  
The only time I'm happy's when I play my guitar.  
  
Sailing in my yacht, what a lot I got,  
Happiness is something that just cannot be bought.  
  
I've been in and I'm out, I've been up and down,  
I don't want to go until I've been all around.  
  
What's it all about, anyone in doubt,  
I don't want to go until I've found it all out.
