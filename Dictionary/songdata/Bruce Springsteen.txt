It's cloudy out in Pittsburgh  
It's rainin' in Saigon  
Snow's fallin' all across the Michigan line  
Well she sits by the light of her Christmas tree  
With the radio softly on  
Thinkin' how a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well once she had a fella  
Once she was somebody's girl  
And she gave all she had that one last time  
Now there's a little girl asleep in the back room  
She's gonna have to tell about the meanness in this world  
And how a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well there's pictures on the table by her bed  
Him in his dress greens and her in her wedding white  
She remembers how the world was the day he left  
And now how that world is dead  
And a good man is so hard to find  
  
She got no time now for Casanovas  
Yeah those days are gone  
She don't want that anymore, she's made up her mind  
Just somebody to hold her  
As the night gets on  
When a good man is so hard to find  
  
Well she shuts off the TV  
And without a word  
Into bed she climbs  
Well she thinks how it was all so wasted  
And how expendable their dreams all were  
When a good man was so hard to find  
Well it's cloudy out in Pittsburgh...

Hear me now!  
I was born 13th child,  
'neath the 13th moon  
Spit out hungry  
And born anew  
Daddy drag me  
To the river  
Tie me in rocks  
Throw me in where  
It's deep and wide

Come back

And sisters,  
Kill Papa too

Sway down low

Into my bed  
With her kerosene

Set my flesh to burning,  
Whilst I sleep

Till my soul burn black  
Black rains fall,

Get down Mama, get down low  
They gonna know me  
Wherever I go

Make me guitar outta skin

In the sandy loam

Sip on your blood like wine

Well now baby, baby, baby

It was the middle of June, me and my grand mama  
Had some free time, flew to Panama  
I was playin' the bar, sippin' a Margarita  
When this chick from Argentina, her name Armenita  
She told me you could make some fast cash  
You help me change my name from Vasquez to your name  
Take me to your domain  
Trick, you must be out yo' brain  
She said it's no game, my pops got tons of cocaine  
And you could have some if you get me on your plane  
I said here the dealie, you sound silly

No lie, I can do whatever I mo' tie, so fly  
Mami started offering me chochas  
Certainly the way she flirt wit' me

Though she nice to me, I'm runnin' twice the G  
For the right price, she could be a wife to me

Hey girl, you wanna go wit' me?

I got a girl out in Asia, name Malaysia  
Who was a real bad chick that owns a Bodega  
She wanted me to save her and make her life greater  
Cuz her dad hates her and rapes her  
She tried to get some paper  
When you wanna leave, I'mma take ya  
In fact, pack ya things, I got a crib in Jamaica  
Mami, mi casa a su casa  
We could do the salsa so, que pasa?  
She said she had money but it was all in trust funds  
But I could get a lump sum if I can get her through customs  
So bring the cake, we gon' swing outta state  
I'mma make you dream when you awake  
Yo Loon, sing the break, what  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?  
I promise you, we gon' see the world  
It 'id be like paradise, baby  
  
In the middle of Nicaragua, met a mami named Talia  
Weren't plain, then I caught a boat wit' this dumb dame  
An immigrant, marry her, make her legitimate  
Illiterate, mess wit' Hud, she don't consider it  
She said pa, llevame contigo  
Lean dough and I'mma pay yo' peoples  
This retard chick started looking at me hard  
She gassed up thinkin' I'mma get her a green card  
And she don't know that she ain't coming wit' me  
And I don't stuck up for some hundreds of G's  
And while I see her standing there lookin' around  
Huddy took the money, slid outta town, what? uh?  
  
Hey ma, you wanna go wit' me?

It 'id be like paradise, baby

In the summer that I was baptized my father held me to his side  
As they put me to the water he said how on that day I cried  
We were prisoners of love a love in chains  
He was standin' in the door I was standin' in the rain  
With the same hot blood burning in our veins  
Adam raised a Cain  
All of the old faces ask you why you're back  
They fit you with position and the keys to your daddy's Cadillac  
In the darkness of your room your mother calls you by your true name  
You remember the faces the places the names  
You know it's never over it's relentless as the rain  
Adam raised a Cain  
  
In the Bible Cain slew Abel and East of Eden he was cast  
You're born into this life paying for the sins of somebody else's past  
  
Daddy worked his whole life for nothing but the pain  
Now he walks these empty rooms looking for something to blame  
You inherit the sins you inherit the flames  
Adam raised a Cain  
Lost but not forgotten from the dark heart of a dream  
Adam raised a Cain

I got the fortunes of heaven in diamonds and gold  
I got all the bonds baby that the bank could hold  
I got houses 'cross the country honey end to end  
And everybody buddy wants to be my friend  
Well I got all the riches baby any man ever knew  
But the only thing I ain't got honey I ain't got you  
  
I got a house full of Rembrandt and priceless art  
And all the little girls they want to tear me apart  
When I walk down the street people stop and stare  
Well you'd think I might be thrilled but baby I don't care  
'Cause I got more good luck honey than old King Farouk  
But the only thing I ain't got baby I ain't got you  
  
I got a big diamond watch sittin' on my wrist  
I try to tempt you baby but you just resist  
I made a deal with the devil babe I won't deny  
Until I got you in my arms I can't be satisfied  
  
I got a pound of caviar sitting home on ice  
I got a fancy foreign car that rides like paradise  
I got a hundred pretty women knockin' down my door  
And folks want to kiss me I ain't even seen before  
I been around the world and all across the seven seas  
Been paid a king's ransom for doin' what comes naturally  
But I'm still the biggest fool honey this world ever knew  
'Cause the only thing I ain't got baby I ain't got you

Said you'd give me just a little kiss  
And you'd rock me for a little while  
Well you'd slip me just a piece of it  
Listen up little child  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
Said you'd take me for a little dance  
If you had a little time on your hands  
Well all I do is push and shove  
Just to get a little piece of your love  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
Well now I don't want to be greedy  
But when it comes to love there ain't no doubt  
You just ain't gonna get what you want  
With one foot in and one foot out  
You got to give it all or nothin' at all  
All or nothin' at all  
Now I only got a little time  
So if you're gonna change your mind  
Then shout out what you're thinking of  
If what you're thinkin' of is love  
I want it all or nothin' at all  
I want it all or nothin' at all

Go  
  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Do you wanna  
Be my friend?  
Ooh, ooh

Nobody gets hurt  
No, no  
Ooh, ooh  
Nobody gets hurt  
  
Well  
We came here as two  
We laid down as one  
I don't care  
If I'm not your only  
What I see in you  
You see in me  
But if I be wrong  
Smoke my smoke  
Drink my wine  
Bury  
My snakeskin boots  
Somewhere  
I'll never find  
Still be  
Your lover baby  
  
Oo, oo, oo

Every once in a while  
Honey  
Let yourself show  
  
Nobody gets hurt  
No, no  
Ooh ooh  
Nobody gets hurt  
  
Well  
I could be  
An astronaut  
On the wrong side  
Of the moon  
Or wrapped up  
Like a baby  
On a bus under you  
Wherever I go  
You go with me  
But if I do you wrong  
Take the master suite  
I'll take the floor  
Sleep in late  
Get some rest  
I'll get mine  
Still be  
Your lover baby  
  
Oo, oo, oo  
  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
  
Every once in a while  
Honey  
Let your love show  
Every once in a while  
Honey let yourself  
Go  
Nobody gets hurt  
It's only love  
Love, love  
Oo, oo, oo  
  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?  
Wasn't I always  
A friend to you?

Everything in your shadow turns to vapour  
You pierce my heart like it was paper  
Radio's crackling with the headlines  
Sun upon your shoulder, wind's in the phone line  
American beauty will you be mine  
Out on this highway counting white lines  
  
I remember last summer drifting through our eyes  
We're in the high grass, my finger in your hemline  
Boot heels click clacking, honey, when you shine  
All them blue skies, ?  
American beauty wherever you'd sigh  
Out on this highway counting white lines  
  
Your hand cups your breast pledging your time  
The things we carried, shining skylines  
Falling sparrow, sky torn apart  
Dark shining arrow, your kiss pierces my heart  
American beauty forever mine  
Out on this highway counting white lines

You're kneeling over his body in the vestibule  
Praying for his life

They say the joint was rockin'  
A goin' 'round and round  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
Well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Oh it sounds so sweet I gotta take me a chance  
Rose out of my seat just had to dance  
Started movin' my feet well a clappin' my hands  
Well the joint started  
  
Rockin' Going 'Round and around  
Yeah reelin' and a rockin' what a crazy sound  
A well they never stopped rockin' till the moon went down  
  
Twelve o'clock  
Well the place as packed  
Front doors was locked  
Well the place was packed  
When the police knocked  
Both doors flew back  
But they kept on a....  
  
Oh they kept on a....

Well they blew up the chicken man in Philly last  
Night now they blew up his house too  
Down on the boardwalk they're gettin' ready  
For a fight gonna see what them racket boys can do  
  
Now there's trouble busin' in from outta state  
And the D.A. can't get no relief  
Gonna be a rumble out on the promenade and  
The gamblin' commission's hangin' on by the skin of its teeth  
  
[Chorus]  
Everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday comes back  
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City  
  
Well I got a job and tried to put my money away  
But I got debts that no honest man can pay  
So I drew what I had from the Central Trust  
And I bought us two tickets on that Coast City bus  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now our luck may have died and out love may  
Be cold but with you forever I'll stay  
We're goin' out where the sand's turnin' to gold  
So put on your stockin's 'cause the night's getting' cold and maybe everything
dies  
That's a fact but maybe everything that dies  
Someday comes back  
  
Now I been lookin' for a job but it's hard to find  
Down here it's just winners and losers and  
Don't get caught on the wrong side of that line  
Well I'm tired of comin' out on the losin' end  
So honey last night I met this guy and I'm  
Gonna do a little favor for him  
Well I guess everything dies baby that's a fact  
But maybe everything that dies someday  
Comes back  
Put your makeup on fix your hair up pretty and  
Meet me tonight in Atlantic City

In my dream our love was lost, I lived by luck and fate  
I carried you inside of me, prayed it wouldn't be too late  
Now I'm standin' on this empty road where nothin' moves but the wind  
  
Once I was your treasure and I saw your face in every star  
But the promises we make at night, oh that's all they are  
Unless we fill them with faith and love they're empty as the howlin' wind  
And honey I just want to be back in your arms  
Back in your arms again  
  
You came to me with love and kindness  
But all my life I've been a prisoner of my own blindness  
I met you with indifference and I don't know why  
Now I wake from my dream, I wkae from my dream to this world  
Where all is shadow and darkness and a above me a dark sky unfurls  
And all the love I've thrown away and lost I'm longin' for again  
Now darlin' I just want to be back in your arms  
Back in your arms again

I see a bad moon rising  
I see troubles on the way  
I see earthquakes and lightning  
I see bad times today  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
I hear hurricanes a-blowin'  
I know the end it's coming soon  
I fear rivers overflowing  
I hear the voice of rage and ruin  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
Hope you got your things together  
Hope you're quite prepared to die  
Looks like we're in for nasty weather  
One eye is taken for an eye  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise  
  
Don't go 'round tonight  
Well, it's bound to take your life  
There's a bad moon on the rise

Lights out tonight  
Trouble in the heartland  
Got a head-on collision  
Smashin' in my guts man  
I'm caught in a crossfire  
That I don't understand  
I don't give a damn  
For the same old played out scenes  
I don't give a damn  
For just the in-betweens  
Honey I want the heart, I want the soul  
I want control right now  
Talk about a dream  
Try to make it real  
You wake up in the night  
With a fear so real  
Spend your life waiting  
For a moment that just don't come  
Well don't waste your time waiting  
  
[Chorus]  
Badlands, you gotta live it every day  
Let the broken hearts stand  
As the price you've gotta pay  
We'll keep pushin' till it's understood  
And these badlands start treating us good  
  
Workin' in the fields  
Til you get your back burned  
Workin' 'neath the wheel  
Till you get your facts learned  
Baby got my facts  
Learned real good right now  
Poor man want to be rich  
Rich man want to be king  
And a king ain't satisfied  
Till he rules everything  
I want to go out tonight  
I want to find out what I got  
  
I believe in the love that you gave me  
I believe in the faith that can save me  
I believe in the hope  
And I pray that some day it may raise me  
Above these badlands  
  
[Chorus]  
  
For the ones who had a notion  
A notion deep inside  
That it ain't no sin to be glad you're alive  
I want to find one face that ain't looking through me  
I want to find one place  
I want to spit in the face of these badlands  
  
[Chorus]

He lay his blanket underneath the freeway  
As the evening sky grew dark  
Took a sniff of toncho from his coke can  
And headed through Balboa Park  
Where the men in their Mercedes  
Come nightly to employ  
In the cool San Diego evening  
The services of the border boys  
  
He grew up near the Zona Norte  
With the hustlers and smugglers he hung out with  
He swallowed their balloons of cocaine  
Brought 'em across the Twelfth Street strip  
Sleeping in a shelter  
If the night got too cold  
Runnin' from the migra  
Of the border patrol  
  
Past the salvage yard 'cross the train tracks  
And in through the storm drain  
They stretched their blankets out 'neath the freeway  
And each one took a name  
There was X-man and Cochise  
Little Spider his sneakers covered in river mud  
They come north to California  
End up with the poison in their blood  
  
He did what he had to do for the money  
Sometimes he sent home what he could spare  
The rest went to high-top sneakers and toncho  
And jeans like the gavachos wear  
  
One night the border patrol swept Twelfth Street  
A big car come fast down the boulevard  
Spider stood caught in its headlights  
Got hit and went down hard  
As the car sped away Spider held his stomach  
Limped to his blanket 'neath the underpass  
Lie there tasting his own blood on his tongue  
Closed his eyes and listened to the cars  
Rushin' by so fast

Father, I have come.  
To tell you about somethin' I done.  
Well as the night reared its light head  
Into a baby's sun,  
We rolled down into the town  
From where the black throats come.  
  
And you know there was a robb'ry.  
There was a holdup.  
Ooh, there was a shootout.  
And there was a killin'.  
And there's blood on my hands.  
Today I killed a man.  
  
Well now, sister, you know me well.  
And you ask me well, how it was I felt.  
Well, she had an appetite for lovin'  
Only a fadin' beauty could posses.  
She knew just what she wanted  
And she wouldn't take less.  
  
I figured it was a small town.  
It was at sundown.  
It was just a small crowd of people around.  
Oh! But he wouldn't put his guns down.  
No, he wouldn't put his guns down.  
Oh, he wouldn't put his guns down.  
Now his blood's on my hands.  
Today I killed a man.  
  
And, papa, you showed me the beauty of buckshot.  
Well, that song a bullet sings as she whistles.  
And showed me the story of the self-loading pistol.  
  
Well now, father. I have come.  
To tell you about somethin' I done.  
He had a widow, runnin' through town screamin'.  
He had a brother, and his tears were streamin'.  
Now I'm movin' on the border  
With a rifle on my shoulder.  
  
'cuz, daddy, you showed me the beauty of buckshot.  
The love song a bullet sings as she whistles.  
And showed me the glory of the self-loading pistol.  
  
And I just come to tell ya,  
That it don't hurt no more.  
No, it don't hurt no more,  
'cuz your son, he's an outlaw.  
Oh, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Yes, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Oh, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Now, your son, he's an outlaw.  
Oh, your son, he's an outlaw.  
And this blood feels good on my hands.  
Today I killed a man.

Well don't you want to climb a mountain  
Yeah, don't you want to ride the river  
Drink from a magic fountain  
Give your woman all the love that you can give her  
Well don't you want to be an outlaw  
Don't you want to ride the range  
Don't you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like jesse, like jesse james  
  
Well now don't you want to swim the ocean  
Don't you want to climb the highest tree  
Drink some of momma's lovin' potion  
Get your woman till she just can't see  
Don't you want to be an outlaw  
Just a poor boy out on the skids  
Don't you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like billy, just like billy the kid  
  
Well now billy he was a bad boy, he won the wild west  
By the year of 21, as many notches on his gun  
But someone laid him to an early rest  
  
Don't you want to climb a mountain  
Don't you want to ride the river  
Drink from a magic fountain  
Give your woman all the love that you can give her  
Don't you want to be an outlaw  
Don't you want to ride the range  
Don't you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like jesse  
  
Guitar solo

As many notches on his gun as the years of 21  
But someone laid him to an early rest

Don't you want to ride the river  
Drink from a magic fountain  
Give your woman all the love that you can give her  
Don't you want to be an outlaw  
Don't you want to ride the range  
Don't you want to be an outlaw children  
Just like jesse, like jesse james

Just like jesse, just like jesse, just like jesse james

Your scrapbook's filled with pictures of all your leading men  
Well baby don't put my picture in there with them  
Don't make us some little girl's dream that can't ever come true  
That only serves to hurt and make you cry like you do  
Well baby don't do it to me and I won't do it to you  
  
You see all the romantic movies, you dream and take the boys home  
But when the action fades you're left all alone  
You deserve better than this, little girl, can't you see that you do  
Do you need somebody to prove it to you?  
Well you prove it to me and I'll prove it to you  
  
Now every night you go out looking for true love's satisfaction  
But in the morning you end up settling for just lights, camera, action  
  
And another cameo role with some bit player you're befriending  
You're gonna go broken-hearted looking for that happy ending  
Well girl you're gonna end up just another lonely ticket sold  
Cryin' alone in the theater as the credits roll  
  
You say I'll be like those other guys  
Who filled your head with pretty lies  
And dreams that can never come true  
Well baby you be true to me  
And I'll be true to you

Take me now baby here as I am  
Pull me close try an understand  
I work all day out in the hot sun  
Stay with me now till the mornin' comes  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take me now as the sun descends  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
Because the night belongs to lovers  
Because the night belongs to us  
  
What I got I have earned  
What I'm not I have learned  
Desire and hunger is the fire I breathe  
Just stay in my bed till the morning comes  
Come on now try and understand  
The way I feel when I'm in your hands  
Take me now as the sun descends  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
They can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night  
  
Your love is here and now  
The vicious circle turns and burns without  
Though I cannot live forgive me now  
The time has come to take this moment and  
They can't hurt you now  
  
Because the night

Well my soul checked out missing as I sat listening  
To the hours and minutes tickin' away  
Yeah just sittin' around waitin' for my life to begin  
While it was all just slippin' away  
I'm tired of waitin' for tomorrow to come  
Or that train to come roarin' round the bend  
I got a new suit of clothes a pretty red rose  
And a woman I can call my friend  
  
These are better days baby  
Yeah there's better days shining through  
These are better days baby  
Better days with a girl like you  
  
Well I took a piss at fortune's sweet kiss  
It's like eatin' caviar and dirt  
It's a sad funny ending to find yourself pretending  
A rich man in a poor man's shirt  
Now my ass was draggin' when from a passin' gypsy wagon  
Your heart like a diamond shone  
Tonight I'm layin' in your arms carvin' lucky charms  
Out of these hard luck bones  
  
These are better days baby  
These are better days it true  
These are better days  
There's better days shining through  
  
Now a life of leisure and pirate's treasure  
Don't make much for tragedy  
But it's a sad man my friend who's livin' in his own skin  
And can't stand the company  
Every fool's got a reason for feelin' sorry for himself  
And turning his heart to stone  
Tonight this fool's halfway to heaven and just a mile outta hell  
And I feel like I'm comin' home  
  
These are better days baby  
There's better days shining through  
These are better days  
Better days with a girl like you  
  
These are better days baby  
These are better days it's true  
These are better days  
Better days are shining through

Bishop danced with a thumbscrew woman  
Did a double-quick back flip and slid across the floor  
The Catholic traffic flowed freely 'cross the river  
And fiddlestick fiddled quick out the front door  
Oh baby dumpling, mama's in the back tree  
If the bow breaks mama might fall  
Little sad and only, baby don't be lonely  
Mama knows 'rithmatic, knows how to take a fall  
Mama knows 'rithmatic, knows how to take a fall  
  
And the kids are crying "Flapjacks, make 'em fat", early in the mornin'  
Little Jack, grab your hat, hear the breakfast call  
Muskrat, bat a cat, kick him in the fireplace  
There's someone in the kitchen blowing "Dinah" on their horn  
There's someone in the kitchen blowing "Dinah" like they're born  
  
Well maverick daddy got one-eyed bridge  
She glides like a monkey-mule kicking on the back slide  
Over hill, over hill, daddy don't you spill now  
Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill  
Papa got a switch stick, he's pumping little Bill  
And Billy, he's crying "Tomahawk, tomahawk, daddy better duck now"  
The Mohawks, the Mohawks, they're still out there in the woods  
Monatuk, Ocanuk, runnin' through my dreams now  
With fire on their fingertips and Indian screams  
With fire on their fingertips and feathers made of moonbeams  
  
Well early in the morning the cannoneer cried  
"I seen the sailor's warning in the western sky"  
Well mountain man, if you can, cut me down a fir tree  
Branches full of candlesticks for baby and me  
And my darling cried, she said "Honey, the weathervane  
Lately it's been pointing the way to heaven  
Scatterbrains, scatterbrains, watch out where you fall  
Champagne, champagne, a round for all the old choir boys  
They're busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall  
They're busting off the altar chasing Dinah through the hall

Rainey Williams' playground was the Mott Haven streets where he ran past
melted candles and flower wreaths, names and photos of young black faces,
whose death and blood consecrated these places. Rainey's mother said, "Rainey
stay at my side, for you are my blessing you are my pride. It's your love here
that keeps my soul alive. I want you to come home from school and stay
inside."  
  
Rainey'd do his work and put his books away. There was a channel showed a
western movie everyday. Lynette brought him home books on the black cowboys of
the Oklahoma range and the Seminole scouts who fought the tribes of the Great
Plains. Summer come and the days grew long. Rainey always had his mother's
smile to depend on. Along a street of stray bullets he made his way, to the
warmth of her arms at the end of each day.  
  
Come the fall the rain flooded these homes, here in Ezekiel's valley of dry
bones, it fell hard and dark to the ground. It fell without a sound. Lynette
took up with a man whose business was the boulevard, whose smile was fixed in
a face that was never off guard. In the pipes 'neath the kitchen sink his
secrets he kept. In the day, behind drawn curtains, in Lynette's bedroom he
slept.  
  
Then she got lost in the days. The smile Rainey depended on dusted away, the
arms that held him were no more his home. He lay at night his head pressed to
her chest listening to the ghost in her bones.  
  
In the kitchen Rainey slipped his hand between the pipes. From a brown bag
pulled five hundred dollar bills and stuck it in his coat side, stood in the
dark at his mother's bed, brushed her hair and kissed her eyes.  
  
In the twilight Rainey walked to the station along streets of stone. Through
Pennsylvania and Ohio his train drifted on. Through the small towns of Indiana
the big train crept, as he lay his head back on the seat and slept. He awoke
and the towns gave way to muddy fields of green, corn and cotton and an
endless nothin' in between. Over the rutted hills of Oklahoma the red sun
slipped and was gone. The moon rose and stripped the earth to its bone.

Madman drummers bummers and Indians in the summer with a teenage diplomat  
In the dumps with the mumps as the adolescent pumps his way into his hat  
With a boulder on my shoulder, feelin' kinda older, I tripped the merry-go-
round  
With this very unpleasing sneezing and wheezing, the calliope crashed to the
ground  
Some all-hot half-shot was headin' for the hot spot, snappin' his fingers,
clappin' his hands  
And some fleshpot mascot was tied into a lover's knot with a whatnot in her
hand  
And now young Scott with a slingshot finally found a tender spot and throws
his lover in the sand  
And some bloodshot forget-me-not whispers, "Daddy's within earshot, save the
buckshot, turn up the band"  
  
And she was blinded by the light  
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
She got down but she never got tight, but she'll make it alright  
  
Some brimstone baritone anti-cyclone rolling stone preacher from the East  
He says, "Dethrone the dictaphone, hit it in its funny bone, that's where they
expect it least"  
And some new-mown chaperone was standin' in the corner all alone, watchin' the
young girls dance  
And some fresh-sown moonstone was messin' with his frozen zone to remind him
of the feeling of romance  
  
Yeah, he was blinded by the light  
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
He got down but he never got tight, but he's gonna make it tonight  
  
Some silicone sister with her manager's mister told me I got what it takes  
She said, "I'll turn you on, sonny, to something strong if you play that song
with the funky break"  
And Go-Cart Mozart was checkin' out the weather chart to see if it was safe to
go outside  
And little Early-Pearly came by in her curly-wurly and asked me if I needed a
ride  
Oh, some hazard from Harvard was skunked on beer, playin' backyard bombardier  
Yes, and Scotland Yard was trying hard, they sent some dude with a calling
card, he said, "Do what you like, but don't do it here"  
Well, I jumped up, turned around, spit in the air, fell on the ground and
asked him which was the way back home  
He said, "Take a right at the light, keep goin' straight until night, and
then, boy, you're on your own"  
And now in Zanzibar, a shootin' star was ridin' in a side car, hummin' a lunar
tune  
Yes, and the avatar said, "Blow the bar but first remove the cookie jar, we're
gonna teach those boys to laugh too soon"  
And some kidnapped handicap was complainin' that he caught the clap from some
mousetrap he bought last night  
Well, I unsnapped his skull cap and between his ears I saw a gap but figured
he'd be all right  
  
He was just blinded by the light  
Cut loose like a deuce, another runner in the night  
Blinded by the light  
Mama always told me not to look into the sights of the sun  
Oh, but Mama, that's where the fun is  
I was blinded  
I was blinded  
I was blinded

We played king of the mountain out on the end  
The world come chargin' up the hill, and we were women and men  
Now there's so much that time, time and memory fade away  
We got our own roads to ride and chances we gotta take  
We stood side by side each one fightin' for the other  
We said until we died we'd always be blood brothers  
  
Now the hardness of this world slowly grinds your dreams away  
Makin' a fool's joke out of the promises we make  
And what once seemed black and white turns to so many shades of gray  
We lose ourselves in work to do and bills to pay  
And it's a ride, ride, ride, and there ain't much cover  
With no one runnin' by your side my blood brother  
  
On through the houses of the dead past those fallen in their tracks  
Always movin' ahead and never lookin' back  
Now I don't know how I feel, I don't know how I feel tonight  
If I've fallen 'neath the wheel, if I've lost or I've gained sight  
I don't even know why, I don't why I made this call  
Or if any of this matters anymore after all  
  
But the stars are burnin' bright like some mystery uncovered  
I'll keep movin' through the dark with you in my heart  
My blood brother

I'm standing in the backyard  
Listening to the party Inside  
Tonight I'm drinkin' in the forgiveness  
This life provides  
The scars we carry remain but the pain slips away it seems  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
I'm watchin' you through the window  
With your girlfriends from back home  
You're showin' off your dress  
There's laughter and a toast  
From your daddy to the prettiest bride he's ever seen  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
In the darkness my fingers slip across your skin  
I feel your sweet reply  
The room fades away and suddenly I'm way up high  
Just holdin' you to me  
As through the window the moonlight streams  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams  
  
Now the ritual begins  
'Neath the wedding garland we meet as strangers  
The dance floor is alive with beauty  
Mystery and danger  
We dance out 'neath the stars' ancient light into the darkening trees  
Oh won't you baby be in my book of dreams

Born down in a dead mans town  
The first kick I took was when I hit the ground  
End up like a dog that's been beat too much  
Till you spend half your life just covering up  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
I was born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
  
Got in a little hometown cream  
So they put a rifle in my hand  
Sent me off to a foreign land  
To go and kill the yellow man  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
  
Come back home to the refinery  
Hiring man said "son if it was up to me"  
Went down to see my V.A. man  
He said "son, don't you understand"  
  
I had a brother at Khe Sahn  
Fighting off the Viet Cong  
They're still there, he's all gone  
  
He had a woman he loved in Saigon  
I got a picture of him in her arms now  
  
Down in the shadow of the penitentiary  
Out by the gas fires of the refinery  
I'm ten years burning down the road  
Nowhere to run ain't got nowhere to go  
  
Born in the U.S.A., I was born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a long gone daddy in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., born in the U.S.A.  
Born in the U.S.A., I'm a cool rocking daddy in the U.S.A.

I hold you in my arms  
As the band plays  
What are those words whispered baby  
Just as you turn away  
I saw you last night  
Out on the edge of town  
I want to read your mind  
To know just what I've got in this new thing I've found  
So tell me what I see  
When I look in your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
I heard somebody call your name  
From underneath our willow  
I saw something tucked in shame  
Underneath your pillow  
Well I've tried so hard baby  
But I just can't see  
What a woman like you  
Is doing with me  
So tell me who I see  
When I look in your eyes  
Is that you baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Now look at me baby  
Struggling to do everything right  
And then it all falls apart  
When out go the lights  
I'm just a lonely pilgrim  
I walk this world in wealth  
I want to know if it's you I don't trust  
'Cause I damn sure don't trust myself  
  
Now you play the loving woman  
I'll play the faithful man  
But just don't look too close  
Into the palm of my hand  
We stood at the altar  
The gypsy swore our future was bright  
But come the wee wee hours  
Well maybe baby the gypsy lied  
So when you look at me  
You better look hard and look twice  
Is that me baby  
Or just a brilliant disguise  
  
Tonight our bed is cold  
Lost in the darkness of our love  
God have mercy on the man  
Who doubts what he's sure of

If you love this land of the free  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring them back from overseas  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
It will make the politicians sad, I know  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
They wanna tangle with their foe  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
They wanna test their grand theories  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
With the blood of you and me  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
We'll give no more brave young lives  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
For the gleam in someone's eyes  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
The men will cheer and the boys will shout  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
And we will all turn out  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
The church bells will ring with joy  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
To welcome our darling girls and boys  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
We will lift their voice in song  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
When Johnny comes marching home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring them back from the overseas  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
If you love this land of free  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  
Bring them back from the overseas  
Bring 'em home, bring 'em home  

I lie in bed but baby I can't sleep no matter how hard I try  
There's something bad, baby, wrong with me whenever I close my eyes  
The dreams of Mary keep me awake with every little curve in place  
When I walk home in the daybreak I pray come back home, baby, won't you give
me  
Darlin' bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night  
  
I walk the street, I'm lookin' for romance  
I end up stumblin' in some stupid half-trance  
As I watch the lovers mix with circumstance  
We watch the disco dancers dance  
  
I look for connection in some new eyes  
But for protection they're tranquilized  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who lies  
  
Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night  
  
Is it as simple as it seems  
I don't know what I'm doin' here, is it as simple as it seems  
Is it as simple as I fear, well if I'm right...  
  
I look for connection in some new eyes  
But for protection they're tranquilized  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Forbidding close inspection of who's tellin' who  
Baby of who's tellin' who lies  
  
Bring on the night, oh yeah darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin', bring on the night, oh now darlin', bring on the night  
Come on darlin', bring on the night  
Oh now darlin' bring on the night

Saigon, it was all gone  
The same Coke machines  
As the streets I grew on  
Down in a mesquite canyon  
We come walking along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road to town  
Up here there's too much brush and canyon  
For the CHP choppers to touch down  
Ain't lookin' for nothin', just want to live  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
Come the Santa Ana's, man, that dry brush'll light  
Billy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night  
We buried his body in the white stone high up along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Had enough of town and the street life  
Over nothing you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife  
Now I don't want no trouble  
And I ain't got none to give  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
I come home in '72  
You were just a beautiul light  
In your mama's dark eyes of blue  
I stood down on the tarmac, I was just a kid  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come Veterans' Day I sat in the stands in my dress blues  
I held your mother's hand  
When they passed with the red, white and blue  
One minute you're right there ... and something slips...  
  
msa

Saigon, it was all gone  
The same coke machines as the streets I grew on  
Down in a mesquite canyon, come walking along the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Campsite's an hour's walk from the nearest road or town  
There's too much brush in camp for the chp choppers to touch down  
Ain't lookin' for nothin , I just want to live  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come the Santa Anas and man that dry brush would light  
Jimmy Devon got burned up in his own campfire one winter night  
We buried his body in the white stone high up on the ridge  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
I had enough of the town oh and the straight life  
Ain't careful you end up on the wrong end of someone's knife  
Now I want no trouble and I ain't got none to give  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Well I shipped home back in '72  
And you know you were just a beautiul light in your mom's dark eyes of  
Blue  
I stepped out on the tarmac, we were just kids  
Me and the brothers under the bridge  
  
Come veterans' day I sat on the stand in my dress blues  
I held your mother's hand, and they passed with the red, white and  
Blue  
One minute you're right there, and somethin' slips...

I get up in the evening, and I ain't got nothing to say  
I come home in the morning, I go to bed feeling the same way  
I ain't nothing but tired, man I'm just tired and bored with myself  
Hey there baby, I could use just a little help  
[Chorus:]  
You can't start a fire, you can't start a fire without a spark  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Message just keep getting clearer, radio's on and I'm moving round my place  
I check my look in the mirror wanna change my clothes my hair my face  
Man I ain't getting nowhere I'm just livin in a dump like this  
There's something happening somewhere baby I just know that there is  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
You sit around getting older there's a joke here somewhere and it's on me  
I'll shake this world off my shoulders come on baby the laughs on me  
Stay on the streets of this town and they'll be carving you up alright  
They say you got to stay hungry hey baby I'm just about starving tonight  
I'm dying for some action I'm sick of sitting 'round here trying to write  
This book  
I need a love reaction come on baby give me just one look  
  
[Chorus:]  
You can't start a fire, sittin' 'round cryin' over a broken heart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
You can't start a fire, worryin' about your little world falling apart  
This gun's for hire even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
Even if we're just dancing in the dark  
  
Hey baby!

The boys are too nervous, even to say hi  
Not too skinny, not too fat  
She's a real humdinger and I like it like that  
  
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on  
Devil with the blue dress, blue dress, blue dress  
Devil with the blue dress on

Good golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and rollin'  
Don't you hear your mama call  
  
From the early, early morning to the early, early night  
See Miss Molly rockin' in the house of blue light  
  
Good golly Miss Molly, sure like to ball  
When you're rockin' and rollin'  
Don't you hear your mama call  
  
Well c., C. C. Rider  
Come on see just what you've done  
Well I said c., C. C. Rider  
Come on see just what you've done  
You made me loving you  
And now, now, now your man has come  
  
Well now I'm goin' C. C. Rider  
Goin' to see my baby C. C. Rider  
And I won't be back C. C. Rider  
B

Remember the morning we dug up your gun  
The worms in the barrel, the hanging sun  
Those first nervous evenings of perfume and gin  
The lost smell on your breath as I helped you get it in  
The rush of your lips, the feel of your name  
The beat in your heart, the devil's arcade  
  
You said "Heroes are needed, so heroes get made"  
Somebody made a bet, somebody paid  
The cool desert morning and nothing to save  
Just metal and plastic where your body caved  
The slow games of poker with Lieutenant Ray  
In the ward with the blue walls, a sea with no name  
Where you lie adrift with the heroes of the devil's arcade  
  
You sleep and you dream, your buddies Charlie and James  
And wake with a thick desert dust on your skin  
  
Voice says "don't worry, I'm here  
Just whisper the word tomorrow in my ear"  
House on a quiet street, a home for the brave  
A glorious kingdom with the sun on your face  
  
Rising from a long night as dark as the grave  
On a thin chain of next moments and something like faith  
On a morning to order a breakfast to make  
A bed draped in sunshine, a body that waits  
For the touch of your fingers, the end of the day  
  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of your heart  
The beat of your heart, the beat of her heart  
The beat of your heart, the slow burning away  
Of the bitter fires of the devil's arcade  
  
[Terri's Song Begins]  
  
Well they built the Titanic to be one of a kind, but many ships have ruled the
seas  
They built the Eiffel Tower to stand alone, but they could build another if
they please  
Taj Mahal, the pyramids of Egypt, are unique I suppose  
But when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
Now the world is filled with many wonders under the passing sun  
And sometimes something comes along and you know it's for sure the only one  
The Mona Lisa, the David, the Sistine Chapel, Jesus, Mary, and Joe  
And when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
When they built you, brother, they turned dust into gold  
When they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
They say you can't take it with you, but I think that they're wrong  
'Cause all I know is I woke up this morning, and something big was gone  
Gone into that dark ether where you're still young and hard and cold  
Just like when they built you, brother, they broke the mold  
  
Now your death is upon us and we'll return your ashes to the earth  
And I know you'll take comfort in knowing you've been roundly blessed and
cursed  
But love is a power greater than death, just like the songs and stories told  
And when she built you, brother, she broke the mold  
  
That attitude's a power stronger than death, alive and burning her stone cold  
When they built you, brother

Hey bus driver, keep the change  
Bless your children, give them names  
Don't trust men who walk with canes  
Drink this and you'll grow wings on your feet  
Broadway Mary, Joan Fontaine  
Advertiser on a downtown train  
Christmas crier bustin' cane  
He's in love again  
  
Where dock worker's dreams mix with panther's schemes  
To someday own the rodeo  
Tainted women in VistaVision  
Perform for out-of-state kids at the late show  
  
Wizard imps and sweat sock pimps  
Interstellar mongrel nymphs  
Rex said that lady left him limp  
Love's like that (sure it is)  
Queen of diamonds, ace of spades  
Newly discovered lovers of the Everglades  
They take out a full-page ad in the trades  
To announce their arrival  
And Mary Lou, she found out how to cope  
She rides to heaven on a gyroscope  
The Daily News asks her for the dope  
She said, "Man, the dope's that there's still hope"  
  
Senorita, Spanish rose  
Wipes her eyes and blows her nose  
Uptown in Harlem she throws a rose  
To some lucky young matador

Cold rain running down the front of my shirt  
I'm flat on my back wheels in the dirt  
Angel makes her face up out on Baker Street  
She's straddling the shifter in my front seat  
There's nothing to lose, it's a heartbreak  
The deck's stacked  
So put your foot to the floor and darling don't look back  
  
We're making night tracks through the blazing rain  
Blowin' pistons, workin' the fast lane  
Red line burnin', pocket's full of cash  
Angel writes her name in lipstick on my dash  
There's nothing to lose  
It's a bad break but baby we're backed  
Tonight we'll blow off the doors and honey we won't look back  
We held it in our hearts in the pourin' rain  
We made it through the heart of a hurricane  
We tore it apart and put it together again  
  
Well angel, won't you believe in love for me  
C'mon and meet me tonight, darling, out in the street  
We'll move with the city in the dark  
You got to walk, it talk, it in your heart  
There's nothin' to lose it's a heartache  
The deck's stacked  
So put your foot to the floor, darling  
Tonight we'll blow off the doors, baby  
We're gonna even the score  
And honey we won't look back

Sun comes every morning but it ain't no friend  
I get dressed and I go back again  
The rain keeps on falling on twisted bones and dirt  
I'm buried to my heart here in this hurt  
Fire keeps on burning, you're waiting in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Dark and bloody autumn pierces my heart  
The memory of your kiss tears me apart  
The sky above is turning, the world below's gone gray  
I thought that I could turn and walk away  
Fire keeps on burning, and I'm working in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Radio's crackling with the headlines, wind in the phone lines  
The sun upon your shoulder, empty city skylines  
The day rips apart, a dark and bloody arrow pierced my heart  
  
I got nothing but heart and sky and sunshine, the things you left behind  
I wake to find my city's gone to black  
The days just keep on falling, your voice it keeps on calling  
I'm gonna dig right here until I get you back  
Fires keep on burning, I'm here with you in the cold  
Down in the hole  
  
Down in the hole

Dream baby dream  
Dream baby dream  
Dream baby dream  
Come on and dream baby dream  
Come on and dream baby dream  
  
We gotta keep the light burning  
Come on, we gotta keep the light burning  
Come on, we gotta keep the light burning  
Come on, we gotta keep the light burning

Come on dream on, dream baby dream  
  
Come on darling and dry your eyes  
Come on baby and dry your eyes  
Come on baby and dry your eyes  
Come on dream on, dream baby dream  
  
Yeah I just wanna see you smile  
Now I just wanna see you smile

Ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah

Day after day, I'm more confused  
Yet I look for the light through the pourin' rain  
You know that's a game that I hate to loose  
And I'm feelin' the strain  
Ain't it a shame.  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
  
Sometimes I think I'm wastin' my time  
I don't understand the things I do  
The world outside looks so unkind  
And I'm countin' on you  
To carry me through.  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
  
And when my mind is free  
You know a melody can move me  
And when I'm feelin' blue  
The guitar's comin' through  
To soothe me.  
  
Thanks for the joy (for 20 years) you brought me  
I (sure) believe in your song  
Your rhythm and rhyme and harmony  
You help me along  
Makin' me strong.  
  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
  
OH HO AH HO..  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
HEY, HEY,HEY, YA  
Give me the beat boys and free my soul  
I wanna get lost in your rock n roll  
And drift away.  
Na, Na, now won't ya  
Won't ya take, OH HA ..take me.

When I lost you honey sometimes I think I lost my guts too  
And I wish God would send me a word  
Send me something I'm afraid to lose  
Lying in the heat of the night like prisoners all our lives  
I get shivers down my spine and all I want to do is hold you tight  
  
[Chorus]  
I swear I'll drive all night just to buy you some shoes  
And to taste your tender charms  
And I just want to sleep tonight again in your arms  
  
Tonight there's fallen angels and they're waiting for us down in the street  
Tonight there's calling strangers,  
Hear them crying in defeat.  
Let them go, let them go, let them go,  
Do their dances of the dead (let'em go right ahead)  
You just dry your eyes girl, and c'mon c'mon  
C'mon let's go to bed, baby, baby, baby  
  
[Chorus]  
  
There's machines and there's fire waiting on the edge of town  
They're out there for hire but baby they can't hurt us now  
'Cause you've got, you've got, you've got,  
You've got my love, you've got my love  
Through the wind, through the rain, the snow, the wind, the rain  
You've got, you've got my, my love  
Heart and soul

I threw my robe on in the morning  
Watched the ring on the stove turn to red  
Stared hypnotized into a cup of coffee  
Pulled on my boots and made the bed  
Screen door hangin' off its hinges  
Kept bangin' me awake all night  
As I look out the window  
The only thing in sight  
  
Is dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I chased the heat of her blood  
Like it was the holy grail  
Descend beautiful spirit  
Into the evening pale  
Her appaloosa's  
Kickin' in the corral smelling rain  
There's a low thunder rolling  
'Cross the mesquite plain  
But there's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
It's just dry lightning and you on my mind  
  
I'd drive down to Alvarado street  
Where she danced to make ends meet  
I'd spend the night over my gin  
As she'd talk to her men  
  
Well the piss yellow sun  
Comes bringin' up the day  
She said "ain't nobody gonna give nobody  
What they really need anyway"  
  
Well you get so sick of the fightin'  
You lose your fear of the end  
But you can't lose your memory  
And the sweet smell of your skin  
And it's just dry lightning on the horizon line  
Just dry lightning and you on my mind

One, two, three, four  
  
Girl, on the edge flippin' off the lamp  
There'll be an end darling to your endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, the light on your portrait and the light in your face  
And you'll be looking for another pretty place  
Baby, this side of the street.  
  
Well, keep dreaming baby that your desire brings and girl  
I know the sadness that you find in things, it's true  
Well, baby if you can't take the heat, what can I do?  
  
Well, you and your poetry and your boku world  
Behind the face you hide the face of a modern girl  
On the other side of the street.  
Yea, you've got the look as if you owe the world  
Therefore, you go out there and say what you can earn  
On the wrong side of the street.  
  
Well, you tire of every day bringing the same and so you  
Go out looking for some strange new games  
Well, pretty soon you don't know the score anymore.  
  
All right now... (guitar break)  
  
I know the danger that your desire brings  
And I know the strangeness that you'll find  
Wait and it will seem straighter for you and for me.  
Well, turn on the end and baby turn off the lamps  
There'll be an end darling to this endless night  
On the other side of the street.  
  
Yea, and everyday well it just brings the same  
You started looking for some very strange new games  
On the wrong side of the street.  
Well, you and your desires lead to confusion  
Well, walk away as I don't follow your illusions  
And see, open your eyes and see, girl.  
  
All right...

I've got a mule and her name is Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
She's a good old worker and a good old pal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
We haul'd some barges in our day  
Filled with lumber, coal and hay  
We know every inch of the way  
From Albany to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
We'd better look around for a job, old gal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
You can bet your life I'll never part Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
Get up mule, here comes a lock  
We'll make Rome 'bout six o'clock  
One more trip and we'll go  
Right back home to Buffalo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Where would I be if I lost my pal?  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
I'd like to see a mule as good as my Sal  
Fifteen miles on the Erie Canal  
  
A friend of mine once got her sore  
Now he's got a broken jaw  
'Cause she let fly with an iron toe  
And kicked him back to Bufallo  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya ever navigated on the Erie Canal  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town  
You'll always know your neighbour  
And you'll always know your pal  
If ya made your livin' on the Erie Canal  
  
Low bridge, ev'rybody down  
Low bridge, we're coming to a town

Paul and Silas in jail  
Had no money to go their bail  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Paul and Silas thought they was lost  
Dungeon shook and the chains come off  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Freedom's name is mighty sweet  
And soon we're gonna meet  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
I got my hand on the gospel plow  
Won't take nothing for my journey now  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Only chain that a man can stand  
Is that chain o'hand on hand  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
I'm gonna board that big Greyhound  
Carry the love from town to town  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
The only thing I did was wrong  
Was stayin' in the wilderness too long  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
The one thing we did was right  
Was the day we started to fight  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Hold on, hold on  
Keep your eyes on the prize  
Hold on  
  
Ain't been to heaven but I been told  
Streets up there are paved with gold

When I get home from my job  
I turn on my t.v.  
But I can't keep my mind on the show  
When I lay down at night  
I don't get no sleep  
So I turn on the radio  
But, lord, the only thing I hear  
Is you whisperin' in my ear  
The words that you used to say  
Well, now the days grow longer  
My love grows stronger  
And the fever gets worse every day  
  
I got a fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Nothing that a boy can do  
When he's got the fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Left this little boy blue  
  
I can remember comin' home  
See you standin' at the stove  
With the dishes on the table  
Dinner ready to go  
Or maybe out to a movie show  
Something that you'd like to see  
Oh, you were my sun in the morning  
And my moon at night  
When you put your arms around me  
Made me fell alright  
Well, now the days grow longer  
And my love just grows stronger  
And the fever gets so bad at night  
  
I got a fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever nothing that a boy can do  
When he's got the fever for a girl  
He's got the fever  
Oh, he's got the fever  
Left this little boy blue  
  
It's gonna be alright, now  
If I can make it to the morning  
I'm gonna be alright, now  
If I can just make it to the morning  
  
It's just this long and lonely nights  
Every time I close my eyes  
All I see is her face  
Every time I shut my eyes  
All I see is her face  
But I'm gonna be alright, now  
I'll be alright, now  
When I shut down all the lights  
When I turn off all the lights  
When I turn down all the lights  
And when I lay my head on the pillow  
I can't stop myself in thinking  
"Baby, where are you tonight? "  
"Where is she tonight? "

If your heart is restless and you can't go on  
When you're tired and weary, but you can't go on  
Well a distant dream is a callin' you  
Then there's just one thing that you can do  
  
Yeah, you gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead you  
You gotta follow that dream wherever that dream may lead  
  
Now if I walk in dreams  
And if I talk in dreams  
I need someone with a love I can trust  
And together we'll search for the things that come to us  
Baby in dreams, in dreams  
  
Now every man has the right to live  
The right to a chance to give what he has to give  
The right to fight for the things he believes  
For the things that come to him in dreams  
  
Baby in dreams, I walk in dreams  
I talk in dreams  
I live in dreams

Princess cards she sends me with her regards  
Barroom eyes shine vacancy, to see her you gotta look hard  
Wounded deep in battle, I stand stuffed like some soldier undaunted  
To her Cheshire smile, I'll stand on file, she's all I ever wanted  
But you let your blue walls get in the way of these facts  
Honey, get your carpetbaggers off my back  
You wouldn't even give me time to cover my tracks  
You said, "Here's your mirror and your ball and jacks"  
But they're not what I came for, and I'm sure you see that too  
  
[Chorus:]  
I came for you, for you, I came for you  
But you did not need my urgency  
I came for you, for you, I came for you  
But your life was one long emergency  
And your cloud line urges me  
And my electric surges free  
  
Crawl into my ambulance, your pulse is getting weak  
Reveal yourself all now to me, girl, while you've got the strength to speak  
'Cause they're waiting for you at Bellevue with their oxygen masks  
But I could give it all to you now, if only you could ask  
And don't call for your surgeon, even he says it's too late  
It's not your lungs this time, it's your heart that holds your fate  
Don't give me my money, honey, I don't want it back  
You and your pony face and your Union Jack  
Well, take your local joker and teach him how to act  
I swear I was never that way, even when I really cracked  
Didn't you think I knew that you were born with the power of a locomotive  
Able to leap tall buildings in a single bound?  
And your Chelsea suicide with no apparent motive  
You could laugh and cry in a single sound  
  
And your strength is devastating in the face of all these odds  
Remember how I kept you waiting when it was my turn to be the god?  
  
You were not quite half so proud when I found you broken on the beach  
Remember how I poured salt on your tongue and hung just out of reach  
And the band, they played the homecoming theme as I caressed your cheek  
That ragged, jagged melody, she still clings to me like a leech  
But that medal you wore on your chest always got in the way  
Like a little girl with a trophy so soft to buy her way  
We were both hitchhikers but you had your ear tuned to the roar  
Of some metal-tempered engine on an alien, distant shore  
So you left to find a better reason than the one we were living for  
And it's not that nursery mouth that I came back for  
It's not the way you're stretched out on the floor  
'Cause I've broken all your windows and I've rammed through all your doors  
And who am I to ask you to lick my sores?  
And you should know that's true  
  
[Chorus:]

Good morning, good morning  
The church mouse is snoring  
News is out all over town  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Wake up, boys, wake up  
You drunken choir boys shake it up  
Our Juliet says her Romeo's been found  
Frankie fell in love  
  
World peace's gonna break out  
From here on in we're eating take out  
She ain't gonna be cooking for the likes of us  
Somebody call mama and just tell her  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Einstein and Shakespeare  
Sitting having a beer  
Einstein trying to figure out the number that adds up to this  
Shakespeare said, "Man it all starts with a kiss"  
  
Einstein is scratching  
Numbers on his napkin  
Shakespeare said, "Man, it's just one and one make three  
Ah, that's why it's poetry"  
  
World peace's gonna break out  
From here on in we're eating take out  
She ain't gonna be cooking for the likes of us  
Somebody call mama and just tell her  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Glory, glory, it's the same old story  
Kid, there ain't nothing anybody can do  
It's gonna happen to you just like  
Frankie fell in love  
  
Good evening, good evening  
The church mouse is sleeping  
News is out all over town  
Frankie fell in love

Where the road is dark, and the seed is sowed  
Where the gun is cocked, and the bullet's cold  
Where the miles are marked in blood and gold  
I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Got my dead man's suit, and my smilin' skull ring  
My lucky graveyard boots, and a song to sing  
I got a song to sing, to keep me out of the cold  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Where the way is dark and the night is cold  
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Now I been out in the desert, just doin' my time  
Searchin' through the dust, lookin' for a sign  
If there's a light up ahead, well brother I don't know  
But I got this fever burnin' in my soul  
So let's take the good times as they go  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
Further on up the road  
  
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road  
One sunny mornin' we'll rise I know  
And I'll meet you further on up the road

In the fields of the lord  
Stood Abel and Cain  
Cain slew Abel 'neath the black rain  
At night he couldn't stand the guilt or the blame  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
  
Billy got drunk, angry at his wife  
He hit her once, he hit her twice  
At night he'd lie in bed, he couldn't stand the shame  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
So he gave it a name  
  
Pa told me "Son, one thing I know is true  
Poison snake bites you, you're poison too"  
At night I can feel that poison runnin' 'round my veins

Well the street lights shine  
Down on Blessing Avenue  
Lovers they walk by  
Holdin' hands two by two  
  
A breeze crosses the porch  
Bicycle spokes spin 'round  
Jacket's on, I'm out the door  
Tonight I'm gonna burn this town down  
  
[Chorus]  
And the girls in their summer clothes  
In the cool of the evening light  
The girls in their summer clothes  
Pass me by  
  
Kid's rubber ball smacks  
Off the gutter 'neath the lamp light  
Big bank clock chimes  
Off go the sleepy front porch lights  
  
Downtown the store's alive  
As the evening's underway  
Things been a little tight  
But I know they're gonna turn my way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Frankie's Diner's  
Over on the edge of town  
Neon sign spinnin' round  
Like a cross over the lost and found  
  
Fluorescent lights  
Flicker above Bob's Grill  
Shaniqua brings a coffee and asks "fill?"  
And says "penny for your thoughts now my boy Bill"  
  
She went away  
She cut me like a knife  
Hello beautiful thing  
Maybe you could save my life  
  
In just a glance  
Down here on Magic Street  
Love's a fool's dance  
I ain't got much sense but I still got my feet  
  
[Chorus x2]  
  
La la la la, la la la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la la la  
La la la la, la la la la la la la  
[fades]

I ain't lookin' for just excitement  
Baby that's just a fact  
If you want to get to her heart  
You better let her know just where you're at  
  
[Chorus]  
It ain't written in the sky above  
No fortune-teller told me this  
You gotta tell her that you love her  
Tell her that you need her  
And give the girl a great big kiss  
Give the girl a great big kiss  
  
Now if you're such a fool you think  
It don't matter, baby, what you say  
maybe you better tell her how you're feelin'  
It ain't gonna happen any other way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now baby all I want to do  
Is darlin' make sweet love to you  
  
Now I don't know what the meanin' is  
Why you want to hide the things you feel and say  
But baby it's just a natural fact  
Love was never meant to be that way  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Now baby all I want to do  
Is darlin' make sweet love to you

I was your big man I was your prince charming  
King on a white horse hey now look how far I've fallen  
I tried to trick you yeah but baby you got wise  
You cut me cut me right down to size  
Now I'm just a fool in Gloria's eyes  
  
Swore I'd get you back I was so sure  
I'd get you back like I done so many times before  
A little sweet talk to cover over all of the lies  
You came runnin' back but to my surprise  
Well there was somethin' gone in Gloria's eyes  
  
Well in the dark when it was just me and you  
I asked the question that I knew the answer to  
Is that a smile my little dolly on the shelf  
Tell me is that a smile  
Or is it something else?  
  
Now I work hard to prove my love is true  
Now I work hard and I bring it on home to you  
At night I pray as silently you lie  
Some day my love again will rise  
Like a shining torch in Gloria's eyes  
  
I was your big man your prince charming  
King on a white horse now look how far I've fallen

Well he'd been hearing too many voices and feelin'a little off-rack  
Like there was something big pressing down on his back  
So he called up his friends and they said come on out west  
It's a place where a man can really feel his succes  
  
So he pulled his heart and soul down off the shelf  
Packed them next to the faith that he'd lost in himself  
Said his good-byes and when the dirty work was done  
He turned his wheels into the fading sun  
  
For seven days and nights like a black-top bird he sped  
Maintained radio silence 'cept for in his head  
And just like his folks did back in '69  
He crossed the border at Needles and heard the promised land on the line  
  
Now where the Transcontinental dumps into the sea  
There's a bar made up to look like 1963  
Girl in the corner eyed him like a hungry dog a bone  
As he brushed the desert dust off that Mercedes chrome  
Bartender said "Hey, how's it hangin', tiger?"  
He had a shot of tequila, smiled and whispered "lighter"  
  
He went down to the desert city where the rattlesnakes play  
And left his dead skin by the roadside in the noon of day  
Sun got so hot it almost felt like friend  
It could burn out every trace of where you been  
  
There was a woman he'd met in a desert song  
A little while later a son come along  
Looked at that boy's smile and called it home  
And that night as he lay in bed the only voice he heard was his own

Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!  
  
I was standing by the river  
Where the cold black water runs  
I was standing by the river  
Where the cold black water runs  
I had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun  
  
I had all of the riches  
I had each and every one  
I had all of the riches  
I had each and every one  
I had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun  
  
Well I swore you were my darling  
Yeah, you were the only one  
Since I swore you were my darling  
You were the only one  
Had my good eye to the dark  
And my blind eye to the sun  
  
Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho! Ho!

Downtown hipsters drinking up the drug line  
Down in the kitchen working in the coal mine  
Got a special sin, mister, you can't quite confess  
Messy little problem, maybe baby need a new dress  
Razor-back diamond you shine too hard  
Need a hammer help you handle a little trouble in your backyard(Bring it on
down to Harry's Place)  
  
When Harry speaks it's Harry's streets, in Harry's house it's Harry's roads  
You don't wanna be around, brother, when Harry scolds  
It's Harry's car, Harry's wife, Harry's dogs run Harry's town  
Your blood and money spit shines Harry's crown  
You don't fuck with Harry's money, you don't fuck Harry's girls  
These are the rules, this is the world  
  
(You bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
  
You need a little shot of something, dear, to improve your health  
A taste of that one little weakness you allow yourself  
You're looking for the key of that box you locked yourself in  
Just stood up to the line and be one of Harry's friends  
  
Shadow on the corner, no light, no sign  
Nobody on the street 'cept the deaf, dumb, and blind  
Now Connor's on the couch, Father McGowan's at the bar  
Chief Horden's at the door checking who the fuck you are  
  
C saw Bobby dressed in drag and Mr. Nice  
Carry me into a back room and dim the lights  
My arms strapped to the table, a thousand angels spinning up the room  
A voice whispers in my head, "We do what we must do"  
(When we bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
  
Nobody knows his number, nobody knows his name  
If he didn't exist, it'd all go on just the same  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)  
(Bring it on down to Harry's Place)

Since my baby left me  
I found a new place to dwell  
Down at the end of lonely street at heartbreak hotel  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely I could die  
Although it's always crowded  
I still can find some room  
Where those broken hearted lovers  
Cry away their gloom, oh!  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely  
Get so lonely I could die  
Bellhop's tears keep flowing  
Desk clerk dressed in black  
They been so long on lonely street  
They ain't never comin' back  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely  
Get so lonely I could die  
If your baby leaves you  
And you have a tale to tell  
Just take a walk  
Down lonely street to heartbreak hotel  
I get so lonely baby  
I get so lonely  
I get so lonely I could die  

You stare in the mirror at the lines in your face  
And you try to see, girl  
The way things were when we were at your place  
In the days it was just you and me, girl  
And you cry because things ain't like before  
Well don't you know they can't be that way anymore  
But don't worry baby  
  
I can't talk now, I'm not alone  
So put your ear close to the phone  
'Cause this is the last dance  
This is the last chance for hearts of stone  
  
If there was something, baby, that I could do  
Something that would last, honey, I would  
But we all know, girl, especially you do  
How you can't return to your past, no  
So girl close your eyes and I'll be there  
Hold me once more and we can go anywhere  
Ah, we could  
  
I can't talk now, I'm not alone  
So put your ear close to the phone  
'Cause this is the last dance  
This is the last chance for hearts of stone  
  
And you cry because things ain't like before  
Well don't you know they can't be like that anymore  
Well I know it, baby

One, two, three, four (Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)  
  
There was a woman waiting at the well  
Drawing water 'neath the desert sky blue  
She said, "It'll heal the blind, raise the dead, cure the sickness out of you"  
Come on men of Gideon  
Come on men of Saul  
Come on sons of Abraham  
We waiting outside heaven's wall  
  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
And together we'll walk into Canaan land  
Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand  
  
He saw a watcher at the city gates  
Jonah in the belly of the whale  
He watched you walk your ragged mile  
His mercy did not fail  
  
(Raise your hand, raise your hand, raise your hand)

And together we'll walk into Canaan land

They're holding a committee of treason and lies  
Double speak and sedition then somebody dies  
From the hills the smell of lilacs then the repeat of guns  
When she closes the window and draws the blinds her first touch sucks the air
from my lungs  
  
Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright  
  
She says, "In this house we've abandoned history, in this house there are no
laws  
Just the false taste of paradise and then the fall  
In this house the guilty go unpunished and blood and silence prevail  
Here the dead remain nameless, the nameless remain jailed"  
  
Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright  
  
In this house there's just the dust of bones, the basement's filled with liars  
In this house our sons and daughters are spilled like wine  
So come close my pretty darling and let me feel your disease  
Tonight I'll have you naked and crawling at the end of my leash  
  
Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright  
  
She says, "In this house it's so easy to set a world on fire  
All you need is the need and the money and a soul full of reckless desire  
Upstairs the landlord is dining here with his criminal friends  
Don't worry, they'll have the bags packed and be long gone before the real
fucking begins"  
  
Hey Blue Eyes, yeah, what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright  
Hey Blue Eyes, what you doing tonight  
Hey Blue Eyes, it's alright

Monday morning runs to Sunday night  
Screaming slow me down before the new year dies  
It won't take much to kill a lovin' smile  
And every mother with a baby cryin in her arms singin  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
  
Coming from the city, coming from the wild  
I see a breathless army breaking like a cloud  
They're gonna smother love, they're gonna shoot your hopes  
Before the meek inherit they'll learn to hate themselves  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
  
Tell me someone now, what's the price  
I wanna buy some time and maybe live my life  
I wanna have a wife, I wanna have some kids  
I wanna look in their eyes and know they'll stand a chance  
  
Give me help, give me strength  
Give a soul a night of fearless sleep  
Give me love, give me peace  
Don't you know these days you pay for everything  
Got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
Got high hopes  
  
Got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes  
I got high hopes

I slipped on her shoe, she was a perfect size seven  
I said "there's no smokin' in the store ma'am"  
She crossed her legs and then  
We made some small talk, that's where it should have stopped  
She slipped me a number, I put it in my pocket  
My hand slipped up her skirt, everything slipped my mind  
In that little roadhouse On highway 29  
  
It was a small town bank, it was a mess  
Well I had a gun, you know the rest  
Money on the floorboards, shirt was covered in blood  
And she was cryin', her and me we headed south  
On highway twenty nine  
  
In a little desert motel, the air it was hot and clean  
L slept the sleep of the dead, I didn't dream  
I woke in the morning washed my face in the sink  
We headed into the Sierra Madres 'cross the borderline  
The winter sun, shot through the black trees  
I told myself it was all something in her  
But as we drove I knew it was something in me  
Something had been comin' for a long long time  
And something that was here with me now  
On highway twenty nine  
  
The road was filled with broken glass and gasoline  
She wasn't sayin' nothin'', it was just a dream  
The wind come silent through the windshield  
All I could see was snow and sky and pines  
I closed my eyes and I was runnin',  
I was runnin' then I was flyin'

Hey, go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns go drifting by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Well, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
I know your clothes are torn and ragged  
Hey, and your hair is turning gray  
Hey, lift your head and smile at trouble  
Hey, you'll find peace and rest some day  
  
Now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
My, don't you worry about tomorrow  
Just let tomorrow come and go  
'Cause tonight you're in a nice warm boxcar  
Hey, safe from all that wind and snow  
  
Now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
Hey, I know police they cause you trouble  
Hey, they cause trouble everywhere  
But when you die and go to heaven  
You'll find no policemen there  
  
So go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Hey, can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Hey, that's a hobo's lullaby  
  
Hey, now go to sleep you weary hobo  
Hey, let the towns drift slowly by  
Can't you hear the steel rail humming?  
Well, that's a hobo's lullaby

Verse 1:  
I worked hard, baby, night and day  
The things i had somebody took away

I've been lost, i paid the cost  
But there's one thing i ain't gonna forget  
  
Verse 3:

"Well, the doctor comes 'round here with his face all bright  
And he says, "In a little while you'll be all right"  
All he gives is a humbug pill, a dose of dope and a great big bill  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?  
  
He says, "Me and my old school pals had some might high times 'round here  
And what happened to you poor black folks, well it just ain't fair"  
He took a look around, gave a little pep talk, said, "I'm with you" then he
took a little walk  
  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?  
  
There's bodies floatin' on Canal Street and the levees gone to hell  
Martha, get me my sixteen gauge and some dry shells  
Them who's got got out of town  
And them who ain't got left to drown  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?  
  
I got family scattered from Texas all the way to Baltimore  
And I ain't got no home in this world no more  
Gonna be a judgment that's a fact, a righteous train rollin' down this track  
Tell me, how can a poor man stand such times and live?

Got a wife and kids in Baltimore, Jack  
I went out for a ride and I never went back  
Like a river that don't know where it's flowing  
I took a wrong turn and I just kept going  
  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
  
I met her in a Kingstown bar  
We fell in love I knew it had to end  
We took what we had and we ripped it apart  
Now here I am down in Kingstown again  
  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
  
Everybody needs a place to rest  
Everybody wants to have a home  
Don't make no difference what nobody says  
Ain't nobody like to be alone  
  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Everybody's got a hungry heart  
Lay down your money and you play your part  
Everybody's got a hungry heart

Breakin' rocks in the hot sun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fougth the law and the law won  
  
I needed money 'cause I had none  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I miss my baby and I feel so bad  
I guess my race is run  
She was the best girl that I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
Robbin' people with a six-gun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I miss my baby and the good fun  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won  
  
I miss my baby and I feel so bad  
I guess my race is run  
She was the best girl that I ever had  
I fought the law and the law won  
I fought the law and the law won

Let the frozen cities crumble, crumble and fall  
That's alright, I don't mind at all  
Let 'em all tumble right into the sea  
Well that's just fine, that's alright with me  
Since you came down the line  
I can't sleep at night, I got one thing on my mind  
That's every day, every night  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
'Cause you're just so out of sight  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
Now I lost my job at the Texaco station  
'Cause instead of pumping gas I'd dream of you  
I got thrown out of my house, I got such a bad reputation  
'Cause all I want to do is be seen with you  
They gave me my pay and said walk  
I don't care what they say, go ahead and let 'em all talk  
  
'Til the world falls apart  
I want to be with you  
I want to be with you  
That's what I want to do  
Until they will rip out my heart  
I want to be with you, I want to be with you  
Well that's all I want to do  
  
Hold tight, love me just a little bit  
Alright, a little bit more  
Tonight, tonight give me just a little kiss  
No I don't know, I don't know, I don't  
I just can't understand it, you're not pretty at all  
But I come when you whisper, I run when you call  
When I see you on the street I fall on my face  
I drop to my knees, I plead my case  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's what I want to do  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, that's all I want to do  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you, darlin', don't you know  
Oh, oh I want to be with you  
I want to be with you because I love you so

I see you walking, baby, down the street  
Pushing that baby carriage at your feet  
I see the lonely ribbon in your hair  
Tell me I am the man for whom you put it there  
  
You never smile girl, you never speak  
You just walk on by, darlin' week after week  
Raising two kids alone in this mixed up world  
Must be a lonely life for a working girl  
  
[Chorus:]  
Little girl, I want to marry you  
Oh yeah, little girl, I want to marry you  
Yes I do  
Little girl, I want to marry you  
  
Now honey, I don't want to clip your wings  
But a time comes when two people should think of these things  
Having a home and a family  
Facing up to their responsibilities  
They say in the end true love prevails  
But in the end true love can't be no fairytale  
To say I'll make your dreams come true would be wrong  
But maybe, darlin', I could help them along  
  
[Chorus:]  
  
My daddy said right before he died  
That true, true love was just a lie  
He went to his grave a broken heart  
An unfulfilled life, makes a man hard  
  
Oh, darlin'  
There's something happy and there's something sad  
'Bout wanting somebody, oh so bad,  
I wear my love darlin', without shame  
I'd be proud if you would wear my name

I love to see the cottonwood blossom  
In the early spring  
I love to see the message of love  
That the bluebird brings  
  
But when I see you walkin' with him  
Down along the strand  
I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man  
  
I love to see your hair shining  
In the long summer's light  
I love to watch the stars fill the sky  
On a summer night  
  
The music plays you take his hand  
I watch how you touch him as you start to dance  
And I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man  
  
We struggle here but all our love's in vain  
And these eyes that once filled me with your beauty  
Now fill me with pain  
And the light that once entered here  
Is banished from me  
And this darkness is all baby that my heart sees  
  
And though the world is filled  
With the grace and beauty of God's hand  
Oh I wish I were blind  
When I see you with your man

Sleepy town ain't got the guts to budge  
Baby, this emptiness has already been judged  
I want to go out tonight, I want to find out what I got  
  
You're a strange part of me, you're a preacher's girl  
And I don't want no piece of this mechanical world  
Got my arms open wide and my blood is running hot  
  
We'll take the midnight road right to the devil's door  
And even the white angels of Eden with their flamin' swords  
Won't be able to stop us from hitting town in this dirty old Ford  
  
Well it don't take no nerve when you got nothing to guard  
I got tombstones in my eyes and I'm running real hard  
My baby was a lover and the world just blew her away  
  
Once they tried to steal my heart, beat it right outta my head  
But baby they didn't know that I was born dead  
I am the iceman, fighting for the right to live  
I say better than the glory roads of heaven better off riding  
Hellbound in the dirt, better than the bright lines of the freeway  
Better than the shadows of your daddy's church  
Better than the waiting, baby better off is the search

We said we'd walk together baby come what may  
That come the twilight should we lose our way  
If as we're walkin a hand should slip free  
I'll wait for you  
And should I fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
We swore we'd travel darlin' side by side  
We'd help each other stay in stride  
But each lover's steps fall so differently  
But I'll wait for you  
And if I should fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
Now everyone dreams of a love lasting and true  
But you and I know what this world can do  
So let's make our steps clear that the other may see  
And I'll wait for you  
If I should fall behind  
Wait for me  
  
Now there's a beautiful river in the valley ahead  
There 'neath the oak's bough soon we will be wed  
Should we lose each other in the shadow of the evening trees  
I'll wait for you  
And should I fall behind  
Wait for me  
Darlin' I'll wait for you  
Should I fall behind  
Wait for me

Pour me a drink Theresa in one of those glasses you dust off  
And I'll watch the bones in your back like the stations of the cross  
'Round your hair the sun lifts a halo, at your lips a crown of thorns  
Whatever the deal's going down, to this one I'm sworn  
  
[Chorus]  
I'll work for your love dear  
I'll work for your love  
What others may want for free  
I'll work for your love  
  
The dust of civilizations and love's sweet remains  
Slip off of your fingers and come drifting down like rain  
The pages of Revelation lie open in your empty eyes of blue  
I watch you slip that comb through your hair and this I promise you  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Well tears they fill the rosary, at your feet my temple of bones  
Here in this perdition we go on and on  
Now I see your pieces crumbled and our book of faith's been tossed  
And I'm just down here searching for my own piece of the cross  
In the late afternoon sun fills the room with a mist in the garden before the
fall  
I watch your hands smooth the front of your blouse and seven drops of blood
fall  
  
[Chorus: x 2]

I ain't afraid of no lions  
I ain't afraid of no grizzly bear  
I got in a wrestlin' match with old king kong  
He didn't even muss my hair  
There's just one thing in the whole wide world  
That make me doubt my stuff  
  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
  
Now bring down old hulk hogan  
King kong bundy too  
Bring down old big mike tyson  
I'll show them what a real man can do  
They say the tougher' get goin'  
Now baby that's when the goin' get tough  
  
But I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
  
You can bring on a different sexy girl  
At every night of the week  
Buddy that's okay  
But I start tremblin', my knees get weak  
Whenever I hear her say  
"do you love me baby? "  
"do you love me baby? "  
"do you love me baby? "  
  
I got a muscle of iron  
I got another muscle made of steel  
But when we start kissin' 'n' huggin'  
You may be the bravest man in the whole wide world  
But buddy, that ain't enough  
  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love  
I'm a coward when it comes to love

I got a 007 watch and it's a one and only  
It's got a I-Spy beeper that tells me when you're lonely  
I got a Batmobile so I can reach ya' in a fast shake  
When your world's in crisis of an impendin' heartbreak  
  
Now don't you call James Bond or Secret Agent Man  
'Cause they can't do it, like I can  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker  
  
If you're hanging from a cliff or you're tied to the tracks, girl  
Columbo split and you can't find Kojak  
True love is broken and your tears are fallin' faster  
You're sufferin' from a pain in your heart or some other natural disaster  
  
Now I don't care what kind of shape you're in  
If they put up a roadblock, I'll parachute in  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - I'm in love  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - every day  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker - with you  
  
So you fell for some jerk who was tall, dark and handsome  
Then he kidnapped your heart and now he's holdin' it for ransom  
Well, like a mission impossible I'm gonna go and get it back  
You know I would'a taken better care of it, baby, than that  
  
Sometimes I get so hot girl, well, I can't talk  
But when I'm with you I cool off , and I walk  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, and I talk  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day  
I'm a rocker, baby, I'm a rocker, every day

We sit in the car outside your house  
I can feel the heat coming 'round  
I go to put my arm around you  
And you give me a look like I'm way out of bounds  
Well you let out one of your bored sighs  
Well lately when I look into your eyes  
I'm goin down  
  
We get dressed up and we go out, baby, for the night  
We come home early burning, burning in some fire fight  
I'm sick and tired of you setting me up  
Setting me up just to knock-a knock-a knock-a me down  
  
I pull you close but when we kiss I can feel a doubt  
I remember back when we started  
My kisses used to turn you inside out  
I used to drive you to work in the morning  
Friday night I'd drive you all around  
You used to love to drive me wild  
But lately girl you get your kicks from just driving me down

Hey little girl is your daddy home?  
Did he go and leave you all alone?  
Mm-Hm, I got a bad desire  
  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
  
Tell me now baby is he good to you?  
And can he do to you the things that I do? -  
Oh no, I can take you higher  
  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
  
Sometimes, it's like someone took a knife, baby, edgy and dull  
And cut a six-inch valley through the middle of my skull  
  
At night I wake up with the sheets soaking wet  
And a freight train running through the middle of my head  
Only you, can cool my desire  
  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
Oh Oh Oh, I'm on fire  
  
Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo  
Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo

Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late  
Nothing we can say is gonna change anything now  
I'll be leaving in the morning from St. Mary's Gate  
We wouldn't change this thing even if we could somehow  
'Cause the darkness of this house has got the best of us  
There's a darkness in this town that's got us too  
But they can't touch me now  
And you can't touch me now  
They ain't gonna do to me  
What I watched them do to you  
  
So say goodbye it's Independence Day  
It's Independence Day  
All down the line  
Just say goodbye it's Independence Day  
It's Independence Day this time  
  
Now I don't know what it always was with us  
We chose the words, and yeah, we drew the lines  
There was just no way this house could hold the two of us  
I guess that we were just too much of the same kind  
  
Well say goodbye it's Independence Day  
It's Independence Day all boys must run away  
So say goodbye it's Independence Day  
All men must make their way come Independence Day  
  
Now the rooms are all empty down at Frankie's joint  
And the highway she's deserted down to Breaker's Point  
There's a lot of people leaving town now  
Leaving their friends, their homes  
At night they walk that dark and dusty highway all alone  
  
Well Papa go to bed now it's getting late  
Nothing we can say can change anything now  
Because there's just different people coming down here now  
And they see things in different ways  
And soon everything we've known will just be swept away  
  
So say goodbye it's Independence Day  
Papa now I know the things you wanted that you could not say  
But won't you just say goodbye it's Independence Day  
I swear I never meant to take those things away

I had skin like leather  
And the diamond-hard look of a cobra  
I was born blue and weathered  
But, I burst just like a supernova  
I could walk like Brando right into the sun  
Then dance just like a Casanova  
  
With my blackjack and jacket  
And hair slicked sweet  
Silver star studs on my duds  
Like a Harley in heat  
  
When I strut down the street  
I could feel its heartbeat  
The sisters fell back and said  
"Don't that man look pretty"  
The cripple on the corner cried out  
"Nickels for your pity"  
Them gasoline boys, downtown, sure talk gritty  
It's so hard to be a saint in the city  
  
I was the King of the Alley  
And, oh, I could talk some trash  
I was the Prince of the Paupers  
Crowned downtown at the Beggar's Bash  
  
I was the pimp's main prophet  
I kept everything cool  
Just a backstreet gambler  
With the luck to lose  
  
And when the heat came down  
And it was left on the ground  
  
The devil appeared like Jesus  
Through the steam in the street  
Showin' me a hand  
I knew even the cops couldn't beat  
I felt his hot breath on my neck  
As I dove into the heat  
  
It's so hard to be a saint  
When you're just a boy out on the street  
  
And the sages of the subway sit  
Just like the living dead  
As the tracks clack out the rhythm  
Their eyes fixed straight ahead  
  
They ride the line of balance  
And hold on by just a thread  
But, it's too hot in these tunnels  
You can get hit up by the heat  
You get up to get out at your next stop  
But, they push you back down in your seat  
  
Your heart starts beatin' faster  
As you struggle to your feet  
Then you're outa that hole  
And back up on the street  
  
And them South Side Sisters sure look pretty  
The cripple on the corner cries out "Nickels for your pity"  
And them downtown boys they sure talk gritty  
It's so hard to be a saint in the city  
So hard  
Oh, now...

Driving home she grabs something to eat  
Turns a corner and drives down her street  
Into a row of houses she just melts away  
Like the scenery in another man's play  
Into a house where the blinds are closed  
To keep from seeing things she don't want to know  
She pulls the blinds and looks out on the street  
The cool of the night takes the edge off the heat  
  
In the Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
You can try with all your might  
But you're reminded every night  
That you been judged and handed life  
Down in Jackson Cage  
  
Every day ends in wasted motion  
Just crossed swords on the killing floor  
To settle back is to settle without knowing  
The hard edge that you're settling for  
Because there's always just one more day  
And it's always gonna be that way  
Little girl you've been down here so long  
I can tell by the way that you move you belong to  
  
The Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
And it don't matter just what you say  
Are you tough enough to play the game they play  
Or will you just do your time and fade away  
Down into the Jackson Cage  
  
Baby there's nights when I dream of a better world  
But I wake up so downhearted girl  
I see you feeling so tired and confused  
I wonder what it's worth to me or you  
Just waiting to see some sun  
Never knowing if that day will ever come  
Left alone standing out on the street  
Till you become the hand that turns the key down in  
  
Jackson Cage  
Down in Jackson Cage  
Well darlin' can you understand  
The way that they will turn a man  
Into a stranger to waste away  
Down in the Jackson Cage

We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We're brothers, and sisters, all  
  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
Every rung goes higher and higher  
We are brothers, and sisters, all  
  
Every new rung just just makes us stronger  
Every new rung just just makes us stronger  
Every new rung just just makes us stronger  
We are brothers, and sisters, all  
  
Yeah, we are climbing Jacob's ladder  
Yeah, we are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are brothers, and sisters, all  
  
Yeah we are climbing higher and higher  
We are climbing higher and higher

We are brothers, and sisters, all  
  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
Yeah, we are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are climbing Jacob's ladder  
We are brothers, and sisters, all

I got no time for the corner boys  
Down in the street making all that noise  
Or the girls out on the avenue  
'Cause tonight I want to be with you  
  
Tonight I'm gonna take that ride  
Across the river to the Jersey side  
Take my baby to the carnival  
And I'll take her on all the rides  
  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
You know all my dreams come true  
When I'm walking down the street with you  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
You know she thrills me with all her charms  
When I'm wrapped up in my baby's arms  
My little girl gives me everything  
I know that some day she'll wear my ring  
  
So don't bother me man I ain't got no time  
I'm on my way to see that girl of mine  
'Cause nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl  
  
Sha la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la la la la la  
Sha la la la I'm in love with a Jersey girl  
  
I see you on the street and you look so tired  
I know that job you got leaves you so uninspired  
When I come by to take you out to eat  
you're lyin' all dressed up on the bed baby fast asleep  
  
Go in the bathroom and put your makeup on  
We're gonna take that little brat of yours and drop her off at your mom?s  
I know a place where the dancing?s free  
Now baby won't you come with me  
  
'Cause down the shore everything's all right  
You and your baby on a Saturday night  
Nothing matters in this whole wide world  
When you're in love with a Jersey girl

Well Jesus was an only son  
As he walked up Calvary Hill  
His mother Mary walking beside him  
In the path where his blood spilled  
Jesus was an only son  
In the hills of Nazareth  
As he lay reading the Psalms of David  
At his mother's feet  
  
A mother prays, "Sleep tight, my child, sleep well  
For I'll be at your side  
That no shadow, no darkness, no tolling bell,  
Shall pierce your dreams this night."  
  
In the garden at Gethsemane  
He prayed for the life he'd never live,  
He beseeched his Heavenly Father to remove  
The cup of death from his lips  
  
Now there's a loss that can never be replaced,  
A destination that can never be reached,  
A light you'll never find in another's face,  
A sea whose distance cannot be breached  
  
Well Jesus kissed his mother's hands  
Whispered, "Mother, still your tears,  
For remember the soul of the universe  
Willed a world and it appeared."

Well she drew out all her money from the southern trust  
And put her little boy on the greyhound bus  
Leaving memphis with a guitar in his hand  
With a one way ticket to the promised land  
Hey little girl with the red dress on  
There's party tonight down in memphis down  
I'll be going down there if you need a ride  
The man on the radio says elvis presley's died  
We drove to memphis the sky was hard and black  
Up over the ridge came a white cadillac  
They drawed out all his money and they laid him in the back  
A woman cried from the roadside "oh he's gone, he's gone"  
They found him slumped up against the drain  
With a whole lotta trouble running through his veins  
Bye bye johnny  
Johnny bye bye  
You didn't have to die  
You didn't have to die

One night in a motel room  
Eyes cast like steel  
I drank the wine that they left on my table  
I knew the morning was too far  
I smoked my last cigarette  
I stay only to get by  
The night was dark and the land was cold  
I was frozen right to the bone  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up, oh  
  
Five hundred miles I have gone today  
Tomorrow it's five hundred more  
Outside my window the world passes by  
Its stranger than a dream  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
  
I go to work and I earn my pay, lord  
My sweat falls to the ground  
I see you now but we may never meet again child  
The ice is hanging on the door  
  
One night in a motel room  
Eyes cast like steel  
I drank the wine that they left on my table  
Knew the morning was too far  
  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
I burn up  
Just like fire would  
Just like fire would  
I burn up

With you I don't hear the minutes ticking by  
I don't feel the hours as they fly  
I don't see the summer as it wanes  
Just a subtle change of light upon your face  
  
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away  
This is our kingdom of days  
  
I watched the sun as it rises and sets  
I watched the moon trace its arc with no regret  
My jacket 'round your shoulders, the falling leaves  
The wet grass on our backs as the autumn breeze drifts through the trees  
  
Walk away, walk away, walk away, walk away  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
  
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you, I do  
You whisper "Then prove it, then prove it, then prove it, to me baby."  
  
When I count my blessings and you're mine for always  
We laughed beneath the covers  
And count the wrinkles and the grays  
  
Sing away, sing away, sing away, sing away  
Sing away, sing away, my darling, we'll sing away  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days  
This is our kingdom of days

Catlong sighs, holdin' Kitty's black tooth  
She left to marry some top cat, ain't it the cold truth?  
And there hasn't been a tally since Sally left the alley  
Since Sally left with Big Pretty, things have got pretty thin  
It's tight on this fence since them young dudes are musclin' in  
  
Jack Knife cries 'cause Baby's in a bundle  
She goes runnin' nightly, lightly through the jungle  
And them tin cans are explodin' out of the 90-degree heat  
Cat somehow lost his baby down on Bleecker Street  
It's sad but it sure is true  
Cat shrugs his shoulders, sits back and sighs  
  
Catlong lies back-bent on a trash can  
Flashin' lights that cut the night, dude in the white says he's the man  
Well, you better move fast when you're young, or you're not around  
Cat somehow lost his Kitty in the city pound  
So get right, get tight, get down  
Who's that down at the end of the alley? She's been gone so long  
Here she comes, here she comes  
Here she comes, here she comes  
  
Kitty's back in town, here she comes now  
Kitty's back in town  
Cat knows Kitty's been untrue and that she left him for a city dude  
Well, she's so soft, she's so blue  
When he looks into her eyes, he just sits back and sighs  
Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do?  
Ooh, what can I do, ooh, what can I do? Alright  
Ooh alright, ooh alright  
Ooh alright, ooh alright

Grab your ticket and your suitcase  
Thunder's rolling down the tracks  
You don't know where you're goin'  
But you know you won't be back  
Darlin' if you're weary  
Lay your head upon my chest  
We'll take what we can carry  
And we'll leave the rest  
  
Big wheels rolling through fields  
Where sunlight streams  
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams  
  
I will provide for you  
And I'll stand by your side  
You'll need a good companion for  
This part of the ride  
Leave behind your sorrows  
Let this day be the last  
Tomorrow there'll be sunshine  
And all this darkness past  
  
Big wheels roll through fields  
Where sunlight streams  
Meet me in a land of hope and dreams  
  
This train  
Carries saints and sinners  
This train  
Carries losers and winners  
This train  
Carries whores and gamblers  
This train  
Carries lost souls  
This train  
Dreams will not be thwarted  
This train  
Faith will be rewarded  
This train  
Hear the steel wheels singin'  
This train  
Bells of freedom ringin'  
This train  
Carries broken-hearted  
This train  
Thieves and sweet souls departed  
This train  
Carries fools and kings  
This train  
All aboard  
  
This train  
Dreams will not be thwarted  
This train  
Faith will be rewarded  
This train  
Hear the steel wheels singin'  
This train  
Bells of freedom ringin'

I want to build me a house, on higher ground  
I want to find me a world, where love's the only sound  
High above this road, filled with shadow and doubt  
I want to shoulder my load, and figure it all out  
With Leah  
  
I walk this road, with a hammer and a fiery lantern  
With this hand I've built, and with this I've burned  
I want to live in the same house, beneath the same roof  
Sleep in the same bed, search for the same proof  
As Leah  
  
I got somethin' in my heart, I been waitin' to give  
I got a life I want to start, one I been waitin' to live  
No more waitin', tonight I feel the light I say the prayer  
I open the door, I climb the stairs

All over the world the rain was pourin'  
I was scratchin' where it itched  
Oh heartbreak and despair got nothing but boring  
So I grabbed you baby like a wild pitch  
  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
In your heart you must trust  
  
Now your legs were heaven your breasts were the altar  
Your body was the holy land  
You shouted "jump" but my heart faltered  
You laughed and said "Baby don't you understand?"  
  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
In your heart you must trust  
  
Now you were the Red Sea I was Moses  
I kissed you and slipped into a bed of roses  
The waters parted and love rushed inside  
I was Jesus' son sanctified  
  
Tonight the moon's looking young but I'm feelin' younger  
'Neath a veil of dreams sweet blessings rain  
Honey I can feel the first breeze of summer  
And in your love I'm born again  
  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
It takes a leap of faith you gotta show some guts  
It takes a leap of faith to get things going  
In your heart you must trust

Hey little girl with the red dress on  
There's a party tonight down in...  
Yeah and I'm goin' if you need a ride  
Come on, come on, let's go tonight  
  
Well baby the dreamers....  
They ride down the streets with death in their eyes  
And the new world's defeat, baby, it eats your eyes  
Come on, come on, let's go tonight  
I said come on, come on, let's go tonight  
  
Well a man...  
And he lost his wife  
He walks down the streets babe, with death in his eyes  
Well everybody wants heaven  
But nobody wants to die  
Come on, come on, let's go tonight  
Baby, come on, come on, let's go tonight  
I said come on, come on, let's go tonight

I don't need your answered prayers  
Or the chains your lover wears  
I don't need your rings of gold  
Or the secrets that you hold  
Lift me up,  
Lift me up and I'll fall with you lift me up  
Let your love lift me up  
  
I don't need your sacred vow  
Or the promise tomorrow brings  
Veiled behind the morning clouds  
I'll take the fate the daylight brings  
Lift me up, darling  
Lift me up and I'll fall with you lift me up  
Let your love lift me up  
  
When the morning bright  
Lifts away this night  
In the light above  
We will find our love, we will find our love  
  
Your skin, your hand upon my neck  
This skin, your fingers on my skin  
This kiss, this heartbeat, this breath  
This heart, this heart, this wilderness  
Lift me up, darling  
Lift me up and I'll fall with your lift me up  
Let your love lift me up

Well I've been out of the woods for six days and nights now  
Well I'm a little hot wired, but I'm feeling alright  
I got some money in my pocket and a long lean ride  
I got to make it down to Galveston by Saturday night, now  
  
Well I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K.  
Got a little lost along the way  
  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
Well, I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
  
Been driving five hundred miles, got five hundred to go, yeah  
I got rock and roll music on the radio  
I got a brother on a rig just off the gulf coast  
He says the girls down there, well they're really the most, man  
  
Well I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K.  
I got a little lost along the way  
  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
  
Well I got thrown out of work on the Kokomo  
Don't ask me what I'm doing, I don't know  
I hope he wasn't joking when he wrote me that letter  
Things can't get any worse, they got to get better  
  
Well I'm a little down under, but I'm feeling O.K.  
I got a little lost along the way  
  
I'm just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day  
Just around the corner to the light of day

You broke my heart, tore it apart  
Thought it was cute, thought it was smart  
But now I'm back and I've got the strength of ten  
So I got a message for you my friend  
  
[Chorus]  
I'm Daniel waitin' in the lion's den  
Daniel waitin'for that lion to come  
Daniel waitin'in the lion's den  
dumb dumb dee dumb dumb dee dee dumb dumb  
  
That old lion's mean and long in the tooth  
And like you, baby, he's out on the loose  
Messin' hearts up time and time again  
Now it's the time for that messin' to end  
  
[Chorus]  
  
At night I hear you out prowling around  
Tearing guys up, scaring 'em down  
Now all that growling's gonna come to no end  
'Cause I'm just bidding my time, my little friend  
  
[Chorus]

Early North Jersey industrial skyline  
I'm an all-set cobra jet creepin' through the night time  
Gotta find a gas station, gotta find a pay phone  
This turnpike sure is spooky at night when you're all alone  
I'm living on the edge of the world  
Tryin' to get my girl on the line  
Livin' on the edge of the world  
But I think it's just a waste of my time  
Some jerk keeps breaking my connection, girl  
'Cause I'm living on the edge of the world  
  
Radio, radio, hear my tale of heartbreak  
New Jersey in the morning like a lunar landscape  
Got a counter girl at the Exit 24 HoJo  
Down past the refinery towers where the great black river flows  
OI'm living on the edge of the world  
Tryin' to get a message through  
I gotta make a connection, girl  
Because I'm living on the edge of the world  
Living on the edge of the world  
  
Radio's jammed with gospel stations  
Lost souls callin' long distance salvation  
Hey mister deejay gotta hear my last prayer  
It's a hey ho rock and roll, deliver me from nowhere  
I'm living on the edge of the world  
Tryin' to get back to you, girl  
Living on the edge of the world  
Tryin' to get a message through  
I gotta make some connection, girl  
Because I'm living on the edge of the world  
Living on the edge of the world  
  
Now my boss don't dig me 'cause he put me on the night shift  
It takes me two hours to get back to where my baby lives  
In the wee wee hours my mind gets hazy  
Relay towers, won't you lead me to my baby  
'Neath the overpass the trooper hits his party lights switch  
  
Good night, good luck, one, two powershift

Well now on a summer night in a dusky room  
Come a little piece of the Lord's undying light  
Crying like he swallowed the fiery moon  
In his mother's arms it was all the beauty I could take  
Like the missing words to some prayer that I could never make  
In a world so hard and dirty so fouled and confused  
Searching for a little bit of God's mercy  
I found living proof  
  
I put my heart and soul I put 'em high upon a shelf  
Right next to the faith the faith that I'd lost in myself  
I went down into the desert city  
Just tryin' so hard to shed my skin  
I crawled deep into some kind of darkness  
Lookin' to burn out every trace of who I'd been  
You do some sad sad things baby  
When it's your you 're tryin' to lose  
You do some sad and hurtful things  
I've seen living proof  
  
You shot through my anger and rage  
To show me my prison was just an open cage  
There were no keys no guards  
Just one frightened man and some old shadows for bars  
  
Well now all that's sure on the boulevard  
Is that life is just a house of cards  
As fragile as each and every breath  
Of this boy sleepin' in our bed  
Tonight let's lie beneath the eaves  
Just a close band of happy thieves  
And when that train comes we'll get on board  
And steal what we can from the treasures of the Lord  
It's been along long drought baby  
Tonight the rain's pourin' down on our roof  
Looking for a little bit of God's mercy  
I found living proof

I was driving through my hometown  
I was just kinda killin' time  
When I seen a face staring out of a black velvet painting  
From the window of the five and dime  
I couldn't quite recall the name  
But the pose looked familiar to me  
So I asked the salesgirl "Who was that man  
Between the doberman and Bruce Lee?"  
She said "Just a local hero"  
"Local hero" she said with a smile  
"Yeah a local hero he used to live here for a while"  
  
I met a stranger dressed in black  
At the train station  
He said "Son your soul can be saved"  
There's beautiful women nights of low livin'  
And some dangerous money to be made  
There's a big town 'cross the whiskey line  
And if we turn the right cards up  
They make us boss the devil pays off  
And them folks that are real hard up  
They get their local hero  
Somebody with the right style  
They get their local hero  
Somebody with just the right smile  
  
Well I learned my job I learned it well  
Fit myself with religion and a story to tell  
First they made me the king then they made me pope  
Then they brought the rope  
  
I woke to a gypsy girl sayin' "Drink this"  
Well my hands had lost all sensation  
These days I'm feeling all right  
'Cept I can't tell my courage from my desperation  
From the tainted chalice  
Well I drunk some heady wine  
Tonight I'm layin' here  
But there's something in my ear  
Sayin' there's a little town just beneath the floodline  
Needs a local hero  
Somebody with the right style  
Lookin' for a local hero  
Someone with the right smile  
Local hero local hero she said with a smile  
Local hero he used to live here for a while

Out where the creek turns shallow and sandy  
And the moon comes skimmin' away the stars  
The wind in the mesquite comes rushin' over the hilltops  
Straight into my arms  
Straight into my arms  
  
I'm riding hard carryin' a catch of roses  
And a fresh map that I made  
Tonight I'm gonna get birth naked and bury my old soul  
And dance on its grave  
And dance on its grave  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here  
  
Well my daddy he was just a stranger  
Lived in a hotel downtown  
When I was a kid he was just somebody  
Somebody I'd see around  
Somebody I'd see around  
  
Now down below and pullin' on my shirt  
I got some kids of my own  
Well if I had one wish in this god forsaken world, kids  
It'd be that your mistakes would be your own  
Yea your sins would be your own  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here  
  
Out 'neath the arms of Cassiopeia  
Where the sword of Orion sweeps  
It's me and you, Rosie, cracklin' like crossed wires  
And you breathin' in your sleep  
You breathin' in your sleep  
  
Well there's just a spark of campfire burning  
Two kids in a sleeping bag beside  
I Reach 'neath your shirt, lay my hands across your belly  
And feel another one kickin' inside  
I ain't gonna fuck it up this time  
  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here  
It's been a long time comin', my dear  
It's been a long time comin' but now it's here

We met out on open streets when we had no place to go  
I remember how my heart beat when you said I love you so  
Then little by little we choked out all the life that our love could hold  
Oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
It's like we had a noose and baby without check  
We pulled until it grew tighter around our necks  
Each one waiting for the other, darlin', to say when  
Well baby you can meet me tonight on the loose end  
  
We didn't count tomorrows, we took what we could and baby we ran  
There was no time for sorrow, every place we went I held your hand  
And when the night closed in I was sure your kisses told me all I had to know  
But oh no  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Our love has fallen around us like we said it never could  
We saw it happen to all the others but to us it never would  
Well how could something so bad, darling, come from something that was so good  
I don't know  
  
[Chorus]

The ragamuffin gunner is returnin' home like a hungry runaway  
He walks through town all alone--"He must be from the fort," he hears the high
school girls say  
His countryside's burnin' with wolfman fairies dressed in drag for homicide  
The hit-and-run plead sanctuary, 'neath a holy stone they hide  
They're breakin' beams and crosses with a spastic's reelin' perfection  
Nuns run bald through Vatican halls, pregnant, pleadin' immaculate conception  
And everybody's wrecked on Main Street from drinking unholy blood  
Sticker smiles sweet as Gunner breathes deep, his ankles caked in mud  
And I said, "Hey, gunner man, that's qucksand, that's quicksand, that ain't
mud  
Have you thrown your senses to the war, or did you lose them in the flood?"  
  
That pure American brother, dull-eyed and empty-faced  
Races Sundays in Jersey in a Chevy stock super eight  
He rides 'er low on the hip, on the side he's got "Bound for Glory" in red,
white and blue flash paint  
He leans on the hood telling racing stories, the kids call him Jimmy the Saint  
Well, that blaze-and-noise boy, he's gunnin' that bitch loaded to blastin'
point  
He rides head first into a hurricane and disappears into a point  
And there's nothin' left but some blood where the body fell, that is, nothin'
left that you could sell  
Just junk all across the horizon, a real highwayman's farewell  
And I said, "Hey kid, you think that's oil? Man, that ain't oil, that's blood"  
I wonder what he was thinking when he hit that storm, or was he just lost in
the flood?  
  
Eighth Avenue sailors in satin shirts whisper in the air  
Some storefront incarnation of Maria, she's puttin' on me the stare  
And Bronx's best apostle stands with his hand on his own hardware  
Everything stops, you hear five quick shots, the cops come up for air  
And now the whiz-bang gang from uptown, they're shootin' up the street  
And that cat from the Bronx starts lettin' loose, but he gets blown right off
his feet  
And some kid comes blastin' 'round the corner, but a cop puts him right away  
He lays on the street holding his leg, screaming something in Spanish, still
breathing when I walked away  
And somebody said, "Hey man, did you see that? His body hit the street with
such a beautiful thud"  
I wonder what the dude was sayin', or was he just lost in the flood?  
Hey man, did you see that, those poor cats are sure messed up  
I wonder what they were gettin' into, or were they just lost in the flood?

Running down the highway half past eleven  
Waitin' for my odometer to roll straight sevens  
I'm a lucky man  
I went to see the gypsy the other night  
  
She looked in my palm looked me in the eye  
Said you're a lucky man  
Some folks got fortune some got eyes of blue  
What you got will always see you through  
  
You're a lucky man  
Pa went from the army to the factory to the killing yard  
I make my living with my hands behind the wheel of this car  
I'm a lucky man  
  
Messin' with me man wouldn't be wise  
Roll them dice son - ah snake eyes  
I'm a lucky man  
Had a girl in Calgary I gave her up  
  
Man that love thing was messin' with my luck  
I'm a lucky man  
I'll wake up tomorrow morning in another state  
Kiss me now baby before it's too late  
  
If you want to kiss a lucky man  
I don't miss no girl I don't miss no home  
He travels fastest who travels alone  
He's a lucky man  
  
A man with the world in the palm of his hands

House got too crowded clothes got too tight  
And I don't know just where I'm going tonight  
Out where the sky's been cleared by a good hard rain  
There's somebody callin' my secret name  
  
I'm going down to Lucky Town  
Going down to Lucky Town  
I want to lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
Had a coat of fine leather and snakeskin boots  
But that coat always had a tread hangin' loose  
Well I pulled it one night and to my surprise  
It led me right past your house and on over the rise  
  
I'm going down to Lucky Town  
Down to Lucky Town  
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
I had some victory that was just failure in deceit  
Now the joke's comin' up through the soles of my feet  
I been a long time walking on fortune's cane  
Tonight I'm steppin' lightly and feelin' no pain  
  
Well here's to your good looks baby now here's to my health  
Here's to the loaded places that we take ourselves  
When it comes to luck you make your own  
Tonight I got dirt on my hands but I'm building me a new home  
  
Down in Lucky Town  
Down in Lucky Town  
I'm gonna lose these blues I've found  
Down in Lucky Town  
  
Msa

I got a coin in your palm  
I can make it disappear  
I got a card up my sleeve  
Name it and I'll pull it out your ear  
  
I got a rabbit in the hat  
If you wanna come and see  
This is what will be  
This is what will be  
  
I got shackles on my wrists  
Soon I'll slip and I'll be gone  
Chain me in a box in the river  
And rising in the sun  
  
Trust none of what you hear  
And less of what you see  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
This is what will be  
  
(I'll cut you in half)  
  
I got a shiny saw blade (a shiny saw blade)  
All I need's a volunteer  
I'll cut you in half  
While you're smilin' ear to ear  
  
And the freedom that you sought  
Driftin' like a ghost amongst the trees  
This is what will be  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
  
Now there's a fire down below  
But it's coming up here  
So leave everything you know  
Carry only what you fear  
  
On the road the sun is sinkin' low  
Bodies hanging in the trees  
This is what will be (This is what will be)  
This is what will be

Here comes a fireman, here comes a cop  
Here comes a wrench, here comes a car hop  
Been going on forever, it ain't ever gonna stop  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
[Chorus]  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
Aim your gun, son, and shoot your shot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Rich man, poor man, beggar man, thief  
Doctor, lawyer, Indian chief  
One thing in common they all got  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Man at the top says it's lonely up there  
If it is man, I don't care  
From the big white house to the parking lot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
Here comes a banker, here comes a businessman  
Here comes a kid with a guitar in his hand  
Dreaming of his record in number-one spot  
Everybody wants to be the man at the top  
  
[Chorus]

Well you can go out with him  
Play with all of his toys  
But takin' care of you darlin'  
Ain't for one of the boys  
Oh there's somethin' in your soul  
That he's gonna rob  
And lovin' you baby lovin' you darlin'  
Lovin' you woman is a man's man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
  
Well now his kisses may thrill  
Those other girls that he likes  
But when it comes to treatin'  
A real woman right  
Well of all of his tricks  
No they won't be enough  
'Cause lovin' you baby lovin' you woman  
Lovin' you darlin' is a man's man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
  
You're dancin' with him he's holding you tight  
I'm standing here waitin' to catch your eye  
Your hand's on his neck as the music sways  
All my illusions slip away  
  
Now if you're lookin' for a hero  
Someone to save the day  
Well darlin' my feet  
They're made of clay  
But I've got something in my soul  
And I want to give it up  
But gettin' up the nerve  
Gettin' up the nerve  
Gettin' up the nerve is a man's man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job baby  
Lovin' you's a man's job  
Lovin' you's a man's job woman  
Lovin' you's a man's job

There's a place out on the edge of town, sir,  
Risin' above the factories and the fields  
Now, ever since I was a child, I can remember  
That mansion on the hill  
  
In the day you can see the children playing  
On the road that leads to those gates of hardened steel  
Steel gates that completely surround, sir,  
The mansion on the hill  
  
At night my daddy'd take me and we'd ride  
Through the streets of a town so silent and still  
Park on a back road along the highway side  
Look up at that mansion on the hill  
  
In the summer all the lights would shine  
There'd be music playin', people laughin' all the time  
Me and my sister, we'd hide out in the tall cornfields  
Sit and listen to the mansion on the hill  
  
Tonight down here in Linden Town  
I watch the cars rushin' by, home from the mill  
There's a beautiful full moon rising  
Above the mansion on the hill

Been on a barbed wire highway forty days and nights  
I ain't complain'n that's my job and it suits me right  
I got a sweet soul fever rushin' around my head  
I'm gonna sleep tonight in Maria's bed  
  
Got on a dead man's suit and smilin' skull ring  
Lucky graveyard boots and a song to sing  
I keep my heart in my work, my troubles in my head  
And I keep my soul in Maria's bed  
  
I been up on sugar mountain, 'cross the sweet blue sea  
I walked the valley of love and tears and mystery  
I got run out'a luck and gave myself up for dead  
Then I drank the cool clear waters from Maria's bed  
  
She give me candy stick kisses 'neath a wolf dog moon  
One sweet breath and she'll take you, mister, to the upper room  
  
I was burned by the angels, sold wings of lead  
Then I fell in the roses and sweet salvation of Maria's bed  
  
I been out in the desert, doin' my time  
Siftin' through the dust for fools gold, lookin' for a sign  
Holy man said, "Hold on, brother, there's a light up ahead."  
Ain't nothin' like the light that shines on me in Maria's bed  
  
Well I take my blessings at the river head  
I'm living in the light of Maria's bed

I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town  
I heard about that story going round round  
All I got's a book of love with pages worn clean through  
A circle of gold and one bleeding tattoo  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
  
This town's a secret shared and shattered in a sad song  
Just a Torn and tattered pieces of a love gone wrong  
Hearts of stone and eyes gone deep blue  
Only ours is filled two by two  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
  
Summer storm blue and soft and cool  
On this slinky town streets where the love ruled  
Now it's just a misty sidewalk with the rain drifting through  
Lipstick case and one lonely red shoe  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
Mary, Mary, where have you gone to  
(Mary, Mary, where have you gone to)  
I heard they seen you yesterday in Charles Town

Mary queen of Arkansas, it's not too early for dreamin'  
The sky is grown with cloud seed sown and a bastard's love can be redeeming  
Mary, my queen, your soft hulk is reviving  
No, you're not too late to desecrate, the servants are just rising  
Well I'm just a lonely acrobat, the live wire is my trade  
I've been a shine boy for your acid brat and a wharf rat of your state  
Mary, my queen, your blows for freedom are missing  
You're not man enough for me to hate or woman enough for kissing  
  
The big top is for dreamers, we can take the circus all the way to the  
Border  
And the gallows wait for martyrs whose papers are in order  
But I was not born to live to die and you were not born for queenin'  
It's not too late to infiltrate, the servants are just leavin'  
  
Mary queen of Arkansas, your white skin is deceivin'  
You wake and wait to lie in bait and you almost got me believin'  
But on your bed Mary I can see the shadow of a noose  
I don't understand how you can hold ma so tight and love me so damn loose  
  
But I know a place where we can go, Mary  
Where I can get a good job and start all over again clean  
I got contacts deep in Mexico where the servants have been seen

I got seven pictures of Buddha  
The prophet's on my tongue  
Eleven angels of mercy  
Sighin' over that black hole in the sun  
My heart's dark but it's risin'  
I'm pullin' all the faith I can see  
From that black hole on the horizon  
I hear your voice calling me  
  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Tell me how do we get this thing started  
Meet me at Mary's place  
  
Familiar faces around me  
Laughter fills the air  
Your loving grace surrounds me  
Everybody's here  
Furniture's out on the front porch  
Music's up loud  
I dream of you in my arms  
I lose myself in the crowd  
  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Tell me how do you live broken-hearted  
Meet me at Mary's place  
  
I got a picture of you in my locket  
I keep it close to my heart  
It's a light shining in my breast  
Leading me through the dark  
Seven days, seven candles  
In my window lighting your way  
Your favorite record's on the turntable  
I drop the needle and pray (Turn it up)  
Band's countin' out midnight (Turn it up)  
Floor's rumblin' loud (Turn it up)  
  
Singer's callin' up daylight (Turn it up)  
And waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd (Turn it up)  
Waitin' for that shout from the crowd  
  
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
Turn it up, turn it up, turn it up, turn it up  
  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Meet me at Mary's place, we're gonna have a party  
Tell me how do we get this thing started  
Meet me at Mary's place...  
  
Let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain, let it rain

Hey Eddie, can you lend me a few bucks  
And tonight can you get us a ride  
Gotta make it through the tunnel  
Got a meeting with a man on the other side  
  
Hey Eddie, this guy, he's the real thing  
So if you want to come along  
You gotta promise you won't say anything  
'Cause this guy don't dance  
And the word's been passed, this is our last chance  
  
We gotta stay cool tonight, Eddie  
'Cause man, we got ourselves out on that line  
And if we blow this one  
They ain't gonna be looking for just me this time  
  
And all we gotta do is hold up our end  
Here, stuff this in your pocket  
It'll look like you're carrying a friend  
And remember, just don't smile  
Change your shirt, 'cause tonight we got style  
  
Well, Cherry says she's gonna walk  
'Cause she found out I took her radio and hocked it  
But Eddie, man, she don't understand  
That two grand's practically sitting here in my pocket  
  
And tonight's gonna be everything that I said  
And when I walk through that door  
I'm just gonna throw that money on the bed  
She'll see this time I wasn't just talking  
Then I'm gonna go out walking  
  
Hey Eddie, can you catch us a ride?

Bring it Down, band!  
Now , I just came here tonight to say  
I just want to say  
I just want to say  
  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
I feel just like I'm living in paradise  
  
Now listen  
Now you see, I feel real good tonight  
And I got music on the radio  
And I feel good tonight  
And I got music on the radio  
And I feel just like I want to kiss you  
Underneath my mistle-toe  
  
But now listen  
Santa came down chimney, half past three  
With lots of nice little presents for my baby and me  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
And I feel like I'm living, just living in paradise  
Come on boys  
  
Well now  
Santa came down chimney, half past three  
With lots of nice little presents for my baby and me  
Merry Christmas baby, you surely treat me nice  
And I feel like I'm living, just living in paradise  
  
And I just came down to say, Merry Christmas baby  
I just want to say, Merry Christmas baby  
I just want to say, Merry Christmas baby  
I just want to say, Merry Christmas baby  
And happy new year too  
Oh yeah  
Play it boys go!  
Merry Christmas, Happy New Year

Woke up this morning, was a chill in the air  
Went into the kitchen, your cigarettes were lying there  
Your jacket hung on the chair where you left it last night  
Everything was in place, everything was all right  
But you were missing  
Missing...  
  
Last night I dreamed the sky went black  
You were drifting down and you couldn't get back  
You were lost and in trouble so far from home  
I reached for you, my arms went to stone  
I woke and you were missing  
Missing...  
  
I searched for something to explain  
In the whispering rain, the trembling leaves  
Tell me baby where did you go  
You were here just a moment ago  
  
There's nights I still hear your footsteps fall  
Your key in the door, your voice in the hall  
Your smell drifts through our bedroom  
I wake, but I don't move
