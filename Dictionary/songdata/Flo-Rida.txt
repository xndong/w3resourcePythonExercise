Look at me bitch  
Look at me bitch  
Look at me bitch  
I'm an American superstar  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I got guns for the snitches  
Roses for the bitches  
Hop up off the whip  
Paparazzi taking pictures  
I got guns for the snitches  
And roses for the bitches  
Hop up off the whip  
Paparazzi taking pictures  
  
Heavy metal for them boys  
Slanging pedals for the cash  
Got an appetite for destruction  
You can call me excel  
Ask me bout what a nigga done done  
Ask me bout what a nigga do well  
Ask me were the bricks come from  
That's what a snitch nigga do they tell  
I don't want nothing to do with that deal  
If it's selected I'm bringing them shells  
Only position for me is a player  
That's right player  
Better get it right player  
I have to be in emergency  
Lucky for you if I'm blowing my trees  
Come on my nerve  
No regular me  
It's somebody shawty with me on her knees  
I'm ready if there's a problem  
She sexy Flo Rida holla  
Don't test me get that bro harda'  
Get messy just like a mobster  
My brawls deserve lobsters  
You clowns deserve choppas  
You serve like jimmy hoppa  
American show-stoppa'  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
Look at me bitch  
Look at me bitch  
I got money on money on money on money  
On top of more money on top of my shit like flies  
Open that Ferrari f5 like eyes  
Up and down ocean drive  
Jumping out that Maybach  
With a bitch way back to tease them thighs  
She got a tattoo on her booty and it say 305  
D-J Khaled say it's a movie now don't forget your line  
Cause you don't want me to edit before we roll the credits  
Bitch give me my credit  
I'm so energetic  
I'm fucking like rabbits smoking on lettuce  
But what ever I want I get it  
I meant it if I said it  
And I say I keep pumping I ain't talking unleaded  
If you want it come get it  
Cause boy I'm ready  
I get it fast fetty  
They should call me Tom Petty  
Got two bitches one peanut butter jelly  
I'm an American gangsta already  
And I'm an American superstar  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
I'm an American superstar  
Yeah

Stormy weather with this cheddar all because you hot as ever  
If you may lady, let me play baby, make my way baby  
You won't like it, send it back, I-it's okay baby

Still get involved with the project freaks,

Strap on your seat, and get ready to go

3 million feet up in the sky full diamonds  
I'm only beginning and I get the feeling  
I'm behind the beat for the nighters  
I got a few Miami Vices  
I don't ever look at the prices  
My super bowl ticket's are priceless

Beautiful music for you to go lower  
You and your girl both work this pole  
Think I'm bipolar

From party, and bigger than life  
50 bottles of Luminis  
24 kick, pop my dollars, wake up for the night  
Cameras flicking, I see me  
You're fixing, I'm fixing my collar  
My natural high  
She can get it, my whole click with it  
No question, we are on the champion flight  
This I roll ride, my passenger fly  
We take off in London and land in the Dubai  
This is a marriage, the music my ride  
My life is so lavish, you don't recognize  
So let's toast to a new day in Rochan  
80 million they still rollercoasting  
What's the recipe to this devotion?  
I got the melody, sober like vultures  
  
Oh-eh-oh  
Who told y'all the party's over?  
Oh-eh-oh  
Well, it ain't over till I told y'all

Tomorrow I might be sober  
But oh, tonight, I'm like

My favorite [?] no stereo  
You know it, is falling  
Our bigger first day in New York  
Pardon [?] said I look like a [?] boss  
Deserve double lubba tons I bought  
I pray [?] to get me to the Lord  
But I ran now, just what I respect  
Not a hand down, not one for the jealousy  
I'm a [?] eleven seven, seven six, but I'm [?]  
So random, you're the atom,  
Don't let it be, spread like cancer [?]

[Chorus]  
I know you got a man, man, man  
But tell me what your man, man, man

Listen,  
I know you got a man, but your man ain't Luda  
So please don't let him fool ya  
Cos the nigga don't really know how to do ya  
Who's your daddy rolling all up in the caddy  
Sun roof top with the diamond in the back  
Coming to get some of the bomb in the sack  
Like a bomb in Iraq I'ma come and attack  
Every inch of your body after the after party  
And then on to the hotel lobby riding me like a Ducatti  
Faster than a Bugatti  
I'm like whoa Kimosabe  
Good golly shorty a freak or she been practicing Pilates  
I'm probably just stripping tongue sk-skipping like a track broke  
But if she think I'm fronting just wait til she see my back stroke  
Haa, I be your side piece but what's our future plans  
Cause I be on ya like damn  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, ok, ok, so that's your mans and 'em  
I ain't tellin' you to cancel him  
Do do your thing, look shorty I gotta respect your answer 'em  
Them there's your boyfriend, I just wanna be your toy friend  
Your other, other man  
Not not your lo-lo-lover man, undercover man  
How many rubber man's would it take for you  
Lil' mama to be apart of my plan  
What do you need in advance,  
I can see both of us showing in France  
I can look back at your thong in my hand  
Louis Vuitton no more Donna Karen  
Couple of stacks so what is you saying  
Like Denzel Washington "My Man"  
I don't wanna hear no mo' more bout him  
What it gotta do with me you grown ass woman  
I'm a grown ass man so we both know a lot about the birds and the bee's  
Hold on shorty lets conversate, conjugate, constipate  
Get stuck on each other, you coming up outta your lingerie, hey  
I know you got a man  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Nada, nada, not a damn thing  
He wouldn't know what to do if he tried it  
And I ain't hating, you need some room to breathe and  
I can be your ventilation  
You need a lil' lovin' just a lil' stimulation  
A hug a lil' kissing and then a lil' penetration  
Give it to you like you never had it before  
And you ain't never gon' think about his ass again  
Lips, hips, eyes, thighs here I'm gon' have to give that ass a ten  
And they can get a five even though one of them kinda fine  
But ain't none of them got nothing on you, you  
So let's go somewhere to dine and sip some expensive wine  
Later on tell me what we gon' do d,o  
We gon' bump and we gon' grind so good it should be a crime  
And next time tell your friends to come too, too.

Dance, the boy got us all feeling high  
Ask, the shawty, I'm a astronaut  
High rollin baby like I'm jumping on fire

[Chorus:]  
Shawty had them Apple Bottom Jeans (jeans)  
Boots with the fur (with the fur)

She hit the floor (she hit the floor)  
Next thing you know  
Shawty got low low low low low low low low  
Them baggy sweat pants and the Reebok's with the straps (the straps)  
She turned around and gave that big booty a smack (a smack)  
She hit the floor  
Next thing you know  
Shawty got low low low low low low low low  
  
I ain't never seen nothin' that'll make me go, this crazy, all night spendin'

Had a million dollar vibe and a bottle to go  
Dem birthday cakes, they stole the show  
So sexual, she was flexible  
Professional, drinkin' X and O  
Hold up wait a minute, do I see what I think I whoa  
Did I think I seen shawty get low  
Ain't the same when it's up that close  
Make it rain, I'm makin' it snow  
Work the pole, I got the bank roll  
I'ma say that I prefer them no clothes  
I'm into that, I love women exposed  
She threw it back at me, I gave her more  
Cash ain't a problem, I know where it goes  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey  
Shawty what I gotta do to get you home  
My jeans full of gwap and they ready for stones  
Cadillacs Maybachs for the sexy grown  
Patrone on the rocks that'll make you moan  
One stack (come on)  
Two stacks (come on)  
Three stacks (come on, now that's three grand)  
What you think I'm playin' baby girl  
I'm the man, I'll ain't dealin' rubber bands  
That's what I told her, her legs on my shoulder  
I knew it was ova, that henny and Cola got me like a Soldier  
She ready for Rover, I couldn't control her  
So lucky oh me, I was just like a clover  
Shawty was hot like a toaster  
Sorry but I had to fold her, like a pornography poster she showed her  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Whoa shawty  
Yea she was worth the money  
Lil' momma took my cash, and I ain't want it back  
The way she bit that rag, got her them paper stacks  
Tattoo above her crack, I had to handle that  
I was on it, sexy woman, let me shownin'  
They be want it two in the mornin'  
I'm zonin' in them rosay bottles foamin'  
She wouldn't stop, made it drop  
Shawty did that pop and lock, had to break her off that gwap  
Gal was fly just like my glock  
  
[Chorus]  
  
C'mon

Yeah, yeah  
Ah, yeah  
Today's your day  
We going out my baby  
You and me

Let's get away  
For your birthday  
Take a nice little trip  
Somewhere cross the bay  
  
Hit the mall  
Go get your tips did up  
Your nanny got the kids  
Let's live it up  
About a quarter to eight  
And I won't be late

At the gate baby

Are you ready  
To take  
Your first slide  
Cut the ribbon  
Off the whip  
Put the key in  
And let's shift  
  
Let's ride  
From coast to coast  
Hit a nice lounge  
Might as well  
Have a toast baby  
On this special day  
  
We're gonna celebrate  
My baby's birthday  
  
Make a wish  
Close your eyes  
Blow away

This place so important when the party comes to the roof  
Shorty no stop the dj... but is... one roll at loose

[Chorus:]  
She had Hennessey hips, and Belve' eyes  
Grey Goose on her lips, and cognac thighs  
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)  
She had a bubble like Cris', Patron all night  
Had one mo' sip, too drunk to drive  
I'm hungover (hungover) from Ms. Hangover (Hangover)  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Hey hey hey shorty, took me to tipsy from sober  
Looked at me so fatigued, I must be her soldier  
Hopin' she wouldn't tease and get in my Rover  
Lil' momma you got to breathe like diamonds supposed ta  
Come closer, can I hold ya, just what I need  
Like my Gucci loafers, hold the, disappointment, must be sealed inside  
Bowlegged woman that's what I need, I don't mind  
Like how she flaunt it, see that's my speed, she a dime  
Thought for a moment how could this be so fine?  
Body bangin', I lay the language, that walk is famous  
The proper anus like she was painted  
She got me tainted, I gotta brang it, this woman dangerous  
None other, who's her lover, this above her  
Get it from her mother, did it to her brother  
Magazine cover, glad to meet a hustler  
Shorty whats up! She had  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
Hey parking lot pimpin', yeah that's the way I approached her  
Hips went up and down like a roller coaster  
Miss, got her attention, tapped her on the shoulder  
Serious, she the business and I need closure  
So hood and I'm startin', I'm blowin' see no stuck up trumpin'  
Bugari I'm good and I smell like the fragrance of money  
I'm sorry this lady take over just like a tsunami  
She had on the Jacob, I'm rockin' my platinum my money  
This ain't your normal every day baby  
The type to drive nothin' less than that 600 Mercedes  
It's rare that you find a woman so vicious on the daily  
That grant all your wishes with looks to kill like a .380  
I feel like she put me under a spell  
Pretty ambitious about delicious full attention on the yell  
Shorty ridiculous, I had a mission to conquer the gal  
I put her on my tab, had her sippin', call a cab  
  
[Chorus]  
  
[Flo Rida]  
All my shorties if you with me, let me hear you say Ms. Hangover

I ain't got no money  
I ain't got no car to take you on a date  
I can't even buy you flowers  
But together we can be the perfect soulmates  
Talk to me girl  
  
Oh, baby, it's alright now, you ain't gotta flaunt for me  
If we go there, you can still touch my love, it's free  
We can work without the perks just you and me  
Thug it out 'til we get it right

I'm talking' bout roots  
I can't hate where I'm from  
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me, me  
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking bout roots  
  
Hey I can't be mad at what y'all meet ahead  
I don't regret my ghetto struggle due to my success  
It ain't that beautiful to write on overcoming stress  
Top ramen noodles thank pappy for the fact I was fed  
Look at me now but all before hey Mr. skid row  
The dirty south ain't just a name the way I've been poor  
The projects burnin' white, I call it gizmo  
Went from a gun to them cars in a jigga video  
Can't find a meal to a mil, only god know it  
No record deal to a deal, I work hard for it  
Can I live to I'm livin' like my momma told it  
Before you rip it, gotta sew it  
Yeah  
  
I'm talking' bout roots  
I can't hate where I'm from  
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me, me  
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking bout roots  
  
Hey, still on my coupe but can't take  
Somebody had to be just to get away  
My sister had to leave, I respect her stayin' safe  
Oh yea I had to grieve but I'm stronger to this day  
Pain, I can't ignore it, you might say I'm ignorant  
I'm mistakin' for courage, which victory so gorgeous  
Make it through two bush, I can make it through any forest  
Hunger gave me the wish, but the bottom is so important  
37 Ave and 187 Street, Miami (karat city), now I'm part of a legacy  
I'm thankful for the hood, what is love without jealousy  
There's only five letters really help me  
  
I'm talking' bout roots  
I can't hate where I'm from  
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me, me  
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking bout roots  
  
Hey I know the seeds been planted  
It's damaging my soul but my dreams been granted  
That triple life towards, much deeper than nurse planet  
What could I want more than redoing I never planned it  
Gets no lower than a grabbin' on your feet  
A man will stand for nothin' if he fall off with the feet  
A baller and a hitter all in the street  
If you look beneath the sand then we all need a crease  
Roots before the branches, roots before mansions  
Roots before your paper crazier than Marilyn Manson  
Roots with your grandparents, roots under your canvas  
Roots whether you black, white, or spanish  
  
I'm talking bout roots  
I can't hate where I'm from  
Cause where I'm from made me (cause where I'm from made me)  
I came from the bottom of the slums  
But now I got me, me  
That's because of my roots (yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking' bout roots (yeah, yeah, yeah)  
I'm talking bout roots

(The double dee double di)  
  
[Chorus]  
My lips like sugar, my lips like sugar  
This candy got you sprung, this candy got you sprung  
So call me your sugar, so call me your sugar  
You love you some, you love you some  
I'm sweet like (da double dee double di)  
I'm sweet like (da double dee double di)  
I'm sweet like (da double dee double di) sugar  
  
Hey, I've got a mouth full of cavities.  
Sweet tooth, full of mama, like sugar to me.  
So my love with the lips, put a bug in the ear tone.  
Shawty gotta kiss, it's an emergency.  
Spit sprung for the taste, addicted to her gloss.  
Won't smile this way, baby I rub it off.  
Put my tongue in your face  
A little mistletoe, sippin' Grand Marnier I'm a fan all day.  
Do me that favor, cause I like your flavor.  
My manage behavior, I'm into your major.  
Sweeter so flavor, that's good for this player.  
My hood, now and later, throw back like a pager.  
Pretty much, you're givin' me a sugar rush.  
Lil mama, give me high blood pressure when you blush.  
Lips feel soft as a feather when we touch,  
Shawty that's what's up.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Hey, Sh Shawty would you mind, cause I want me some.  
Now and later, I don't wanna have to wait, you the one.  
Yep! Yep! Your vision, so, so delicious.  
Can't help my interest, candy addiction.  
Wanna peace, to a piece gotta get a piece.  
I don't know a piece, give me all your sweets.  
Bottom and top lip, bout to have a sugar feast.  
Level with our trip, I'm a lip bitin' beast.  
Man for them things, all 42 teeth.  
Squeeze the sugar cane on your mouth, must beat.  
Ain't your mama slirp, stickin', usin' my tree.  
Like taffy but classy, get at me.  
I'm fly let you know I wanna kiss.  
But your lips, they'll do me fine.  
Now baby don't trip with the juicy kind.  
Get, get on the grip, girl you ain't lyin'.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
You like my sugar, my sugar you so sweet, so sweet.  
Like my candy, my candy you so sweet, so sweet.  
I got a good appetite with you on me, on me.  
I'll wrap you out of them clothes.  
You my treat, my treat.  
Girl you my sugar, I call you candy  
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some.  
Girl you my sugar, I call you candy  
And tonight I'm gonna get me some, get me some sugar.

Hey, Ms. Red Carpet  
She can autograph my pockets,  
Anytime, anyplace, anyway,  
I'll be looking at everybody else watchin'  
I don't wanna be obnoxious,  
But this girl worth the gossip,  
Take away the smile,  
The tattoos now, forever she very guard-less  
I imagine her topless  
She might set off my rocket  
Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one  
On and poppin' she mad marketing  
Attitude like we arguing  
With her by my side bring glitter to my life  
I should twitter this girl is sparkling  
  
[Chorus]  
She ain't no rock star  
But she got groupies,  
She ain't no actress  
But she makes movies,  
And when she struts that thing around  
Everybody be breaking their neck like  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl  
She ain't got riches but she got fashion,  
She ain't a model but camera's flashing  
And when she struts that thing around  
Everybody be breaking their neck like  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl  
  
Hey, I wanna know her mamma's name,  
'Cause that where she get it from,  
They ain't never shot her with silicon,  
Shawty is her and her she's the real one  
Touch one, grab one, feel one,  
I wish she would'a told me that  
Ain't nothing wrong bringing the old me back,  
Little mamma knows my body so trophy glass,  
She worth it, bring me some Chloe bags  
Like damn, can I be yo' police badge  
Pull it up, get a little cozy and  
Woman is sort'a like and oldie jam,  
Record some ssh,  
On a playboy cam,  
She ain't no actress  
The movie from my mattress  
Rock star, none of that practice  
But still she got fanatics  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh,  
I wanna know ooh ooh  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl  
  
Ooh oh oh, look at her goo ooh ooh,  
I wanna know ooh ooh  
Who dat girl who dat girl, who dat girl

Staring at me up and down like when my roley's six o'clock  
Now you know you better stop

Wait a minute shawty why you came  
Who you know and who the hell told you to come  
All up in the middle with the business unofficial  
When I can't stand a chick tryna score my fun  
Looking for a dude to rip you off some ?  
I don't need a chick tryna throw my one's  
Let me look rich, I wanna have his son  
I sip Perignon but do I look dumb  
Get a job shawty turn my knob  
And if it don't open up make sure you slob  
My boys [...?] behind the bar  
Sit back blow smoke from a Cuban cigar  
What's your mission  
Looks suspicious

No permission  
Back no interest  
What's the business

Why you up in here (x3)

Steady talking to me

I'm just tryna figure (figure figure)  
Why you up in here (x2)  
All up in my grill  
  
Now I ain't got no time for silly games  
Got no time for silly notions  
But get smacked silly for playing with my emotions  
You figured you lead me on  
But bitch you led me out the door  
Now let me lead you with a song  
It goes like D yous a hoe  
Drunk up all my conjour  
Ain't even leave me with a glass  
So cough up my whole bottle  
Or Ima take out your ass  
Cos you don't wanna see me angry  
You don't like me when I'm angry  
Live like Jackson 5  
But get greezy like Jermaine  
Be dangerous like Michael  
So Tito pass the tissues  
Don't test me cos I keep a clipper number two pistols  
And you will be erased  
Outta sight and outta mind  
So get the fuck on or my girls will wipe the floor with your behind

Why you up in here (x3)

Why you up in here (x2)

Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I want to shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh  
  
I like crazy, foolish, stupid  
Party going wild, fist pumping  
Music, I might lose it  
Blast to the roof, that how we do'z it (do'z it do'z it)  
I don't care the night, she don't care we like  
Almost dared the right five  
Ready to get live, ain't no surprise  
Take me so high, jump and don't stop  
Surfing the crowd ooh said I gotta be the man  
When they heading my van, mic check one two  
Shut them down in the club while the playboy does it, and y'all get lose lose  
Out the bottle, we all get bent and again tomorrow  
Gotta break loose cause that's the motto  
Club shuts down, a hundred super models  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I wanna shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh  
  
Party rocker, fa-show stopper, more shampoo  
Number one, club popper  
Got a hangover like too much vodka  
Can't see me with ten binoculars, so cool  
No doubt by the end of the night  
Got the clothes coming off til I make that move  
Somehow, someway, gotta raise the roof, roof  
All black shades when the sun come through  
Oh, it's on like everything goes, round up baby til the freaky show  
What happens to that body, it's a private show  
Stays right here, private show  
I like em untamed, don't tell me hide pain  
Tolerance, bottoms up with the champagne  
My life, coming harder when we hit fame  
Do you busy with the bail, we get insane  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you do  
  
I want to shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones, wild ones) ooh  
  
I am a wild one, break me in  
Saddle me up and lets begin  
I am a wild one, tame me now  
Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl  
  
Show you another side of me  
A side you would never thought you would see  
Tear up that body dominate you til you had 'nough  
I hear you like the wild stuff  
  
Hey I heard you were a wild one ooh  
If I took you home, it'd be a home run  
Show me how you'll do  
I want to shut down the club, with you  
Hey I heard you like the wild ones (wild ones wild ones) ooh

Saddle me up and let's begin

Running with wolves and I'm on the prowl
