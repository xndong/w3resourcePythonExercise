Just like a buzzin' fly  
I come into your life  
Now I float away  
Like honey in the sun  
Was it right or wrong  
I couldn't sing that song anyway  
  
Oh, but darlin'  
Now I remember  
How the sun shown down  
And how it warmed your prayin' smile  
When all the love was there  
  
You're the one I talk about  
You're the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin'  
Lord, I miss you so  
  
That's how I know I found a home  
That's how I know I found a home  
  
Oh, hear the mountains singing  
Lord, I can hear them ringing, darlin',  
Out your name  
And tell me if you know  
Just how the river flows  
Down to the sea  
  
Now I want to know  
Everything about you  
I want to know  
Everything about you  
  
What makes ya smile  
What makes ya wild  
What makes ya love me this way  
Darlin' I want to know  
Darlin' I want to know  
  
You're the one I talk about  
You're the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin'  
Lord, I miss you so  
  
That's how I know I found a home  
That's how I know I found a home  
  
A-walkin' hand in hand  
And all along the sand  
A seabird knew your name  
He knew your love was growin'  
Lord, I think it knows it's flowin'  
through you and me  
  
Ah, tell me darlin'  
When I should leave you,  
Ah, tell me darlin'  
I don't want to grieve you....  
  
Just like a buzzin' fly  
I come into your life  
Now I float away  
Like honey in the sun  
Was it right or wrong  
I couldn't sing that song anyway  
  
Oh, but darlin'  
Now I remember  
How the sun shown down  
And how it warmed your prayin' smile  
When all the love was there  
  
You're the one I talk about  
You're the one I think about  
Everywhere I go  
And sometimes honey  
In the mornin'  
Lord, I miss you so....

I was just a curly-haired mountain boy  
On my way  
Passing through I heard a voice  
Whisper good evening  
I turned to a shadow  
And saw her there  
So all alone  
She had those sad china eyes  
That sang each time she smiled  
Ah, but the song  
It seemed to linger  
So long it deepened  
My love for her  
Until she called me near  
And then we waltzed to our heart beat  
All around  
The sea was swaying  
The breeze was praying  
Never to leave her alone  
Alone  
Oh, the time just slipped on by  
And with the time  
So did our love  
Ah, her every move  
Just like a fever  
Just like a fever  
Burnin' inside would not leave me

The singer cries for people's lies  
He will sing for the day to bring him night  
The circus burns in carnival flame  
And for a while you won't know my name at all  
But sing and dance and love for pennies and gold  
  
The juggling clown smiles to me  
And every frown we agree is glad  
The nighttime comes to bring the bums  
From Bowery heat to crimson streets of wine  
But magic lands will never touch our sands  
  
Your children smile in single file  
They learn mistakes that others make  
They see although they cannot know  
The needs they'll need to have their greed grow wild  
But dance and sing, for others bring the shame  
And for a while you won't know my name  
  

Well come along walk with me  
And learn the songs that lovers sing  
When they believe  
We'll dance along the river's edge  
Just arm and arm along the moonlit shore  
The midnight cries  
  
Well I just came to chase the blues away  
For awhile  
  
Just like a child you'll cling to me  
From every sound along that rushes near  
It's just the breeze that licks your skin  
and rubs your breast  
And as we lay our river's flow away  
Your woman fear  
  
Well I just came to chase the blues away  
For awhile  
  
With the morning sun we'll wake  
And lift our eyes and watch the eagle fly  
Up mountain high  
And on his wings our love will climb  
And never fail until he soars and dives  
Oh, he'll take your breath away  
  
Well, he just came to chase the blues away  
For awhile

You caught me staring so gently  
You tease me and turn away  
Unlike the young ones  
Your movements you savor  
Like a tango  
My hideaways are longing for you  
You shyly conjure  
These moments surrounding  
Keep me tonight  
All your practiced ways you secretly entice me  
Come here woman!  
  
Like an old window  
I need a little shade  
Like an old tomcat  
Lord I love to parade  
Like a broken old man  
Lord I need sun  
  
Ah, I need you darlin'  
Cause I just ain't done  
  
While wheel waters set  
Now my blood yearns  
Your mouth opens woman  
Give me broken lies  
When you don't feel pain  
Let me smell your thighs, mama  
Let me drink down a little rain, man  
While we're drifting cold  
Out beyond the seas  
We wither time into a coil of fear

I got so tired of meaningful looks  
I got so tired of comin' up tame  
I was so bothered by those balmy breezes  
I was side swiped by smoke fever  
They was a crawlin'  
Oh down beneath my skin  
Til mama come a runnin'  
A mama came a runnin'  
Mama came a runnin'  
Lord said she got a recipe  
Oh and she don't need no fancy sauce  
Yah those devil eyes  
Lord they stare right through me  
Those devil eyes  
Look right through me  
Aww melt my soul down  
Long for those devil eyes

Sometimes I think about Saturday's child  
And all about the times when we were running wild  
  
I've been a-searchin' for the dolphins in the sea  
Ah, but sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me  
  
This old world will never change the way it's been  
And all our ways of war can't change it back again  
  
I've been a-searchin' for the dolphin in the sea  
Ah, but sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me  
  
Lord, I'm not the one to tell this old world how to get  
along  
I only know that peace will come when all our hate is gone  
  
I've been a-searchin' for the dolphin in the sea  
Ah, but sometimes I wonder, do you ever think of me

Lady time fly away  
I've been thinking 'bout my yesterday  
Oh, please listen darlin' to my empty prayers  
Sleep inside my dreams tonight  
All I need to know tonight are you and my child  
  
Oh, is he a soldier or is he a dreamer?  
Is he mama's little man?  
Does he help you when he can?  
Or does he ask about me?  
  
Just like a soldier boy  
I been out fighting wars  
That the world never knows about  
But I never win them loud  
There's no crowds around me  
  
But when I get to thinkin'  
'Bout the old days  
When love was here to stay  
I wonder if we'd ever tried  
Oh, what I'd give to hold him.

When there's wine in your belly  
Love rhythm's on your tongue  
For you are a woman  
And each man has been too young  
  
But for me you were a lover  
Gently under your cover  
Your sheet reeks of odours  
  
Oh i came here to hold and be held for a while  
  
I've been drifting like a dream out on the sea  
I've been drifting in between you and me  
Everytime i think about you  
I can't remember what i said or did  
Was right or wrong, you know i just don't remember  
All i wanna be is what you mean to me  
All i wanna be is what you mean to me  
  
Late last night as i dreamed in dizzy sunlight  
I thought i heard your bare feet up the stairs  
Just like a fool, just like a fool  
I've been drifting  
Like a dream out on the sea  
I've been drifting in between what used to be  
  

Well that girl walks in a stormy bitching whine  
Well she moves that cobra waltz all across the floor  
Tell your mama to sing out, like a slow burn  
Slow burn your motel walls, over me.  
  
Get on top of me woman  
Get on top, let me breath  
Get on top of me woman  
Let me see what you learned tonight  
Then I talk in tongues, mama  
  
Oh when I love you  
Yes I talk in tongues  
  
Get on top of me woman,  
Get on top, let me breath  
Get on top of me, woman  
I just wanna see what you learned  
  
Well like a bitch dog in heat, mama  
We had those bed springs squeakin' all night long  
And didn't you hear those walls a talkin' voodoo  
I feel you right feel you right with me  
  
Get on top of me woman,  
Get on top let me breath  
Get on top of me woman  
Let me see what you learned tonight  
I talk in tongues, mama  
Oh when I love you  
I talk in tongues,honey

The antique people are down in the dungeons  
Run by machines and afraid of the tax  
Their heads in the grave and their hands on their eyes  
Hauling their hearts around circular tracks  
Pretending forever their masquerade towers  
Are not really riddled with widening cracks  
And I wave goodbye to iron  
And smile hello to the air  
  
O the new children dance -- I am young  
All around the balloons -- I will live  
Swaying by chance -- I am strong  
To the breeze from the moon -- I can give  
Painting the sky -- You the strange  
With the colors of sun -- Seed of day  
Freely they fly -- Feel the change  
As all become one -- Know the Way  
  
The velocity addicts explode on the highways  
Ignoring the journey and moving so fast  
Their nerves fall apart and they gasp but can't breathe  
They run from the cops of the skeleton past  
Petrified by tradition in a nightmare they stagger  
  
Into nowhere at all and they look up aghast  
And I wave goodbye to speed  
And smile hello to a rose  
  
O the new children play -- I am young  
Under the juniper trees -- I will live  
Sky blue or gray -- I am strong  
They continue at ease -- I can give  
Moving so slow -- You the strange  
That serenely they can -- Seed of day  
Gracefully grow -- Feel the change  
And yes still understand -- Know the Way  
  
The king and the queen in their castle of billboards  
Sleepwalk down the hallways dragging behind  
All their possessions and transient treasures  
As they go to worship the electronic shrine  
On which is playing the late late commercial  
In that hollowest house of the opulent blind  
And I wave goodbye to Mammon  
And smile hello to a stream  
  
O the new children buy -- I am young  
All the world for a song -- I will live  
Without a dime -- I am strong  
To which they belong -- I can give  
Nobody owns -- You the strange  
Anything anywhere -- Seed of day  
Everyone's grown -- Feel the change  
Up so big they can share -- Know the Way  
  
The vaudeville generals cavort on the stage  
And shatter their audience with submachine guns  
And Freedom and Violence the acrobat clowns  
Do a balancing act on the graves of our sons  
While the tapdancing Emperor sings "War is peace"  
And Love the Magician disappears in the fun  
And I wave goodbye to murder  
And smile hello to the rain  
  
O the new children can't -- I am young  
Tell a foe from a friend -- I will live  
Quick to enchant -- I am strong  
And so glad to extend -- I can give  
Handfuls of dawn -- You the strange  
To kaleidoscope men -- Seed of day  
Come from beyond -- Feel the change  
The Great Wall of Skin -- Know the Way  
  
The bloodless husbands are jesters who listen  
Like sheep to the shrieks and commands of their wives  
And the men who aren't men leave the women alone  
See them all faking love on a bed made of knives  
Afraid to discover or trust in their bodies  
And in secret divorce they will never survive  
And I wave goodbye to ashes  
And smile hello to a girl  
  
O the new children kiss -- I am young  
They are so proud to learn -- I will live  
Womanwood bliss -- I am strong  
And the manfire that burns -- I can give  
Knowing no fear -- You the strange  
They take off their clothes -- Seed of day  
Honest and clear - Feel the change  
As a river that flows - Know the Way  
  
The antique people are fading out slowly  
Like newspapers flaming in mind suicide  
Godless and sexless directionless loons  
Their sham sandcastles dissolve in the tide  
They put on their deathmasks and compromise daily  
The new children will live for the elders have died  
And I wave goodbye to America  
And smile hello to the world

I've got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I've got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky  
I've got heartbreaks, I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I got sorrow, I'm in a storm that'll spare no travelin' man  
I fear tomorrow, got a love that died long before it began  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
Got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I've got a cold chain, I got rain fallin' on my head from above  
I've got a bad pain, I got a gal don't know the meaning of love  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows  
I've got heartaches, I got stingin' water fallin' out of the sky  
I've got heartbreaks, I got a long lost lover, got a reason to die  
I got ten thousand troubles, a million woes  
I got grief in my soul nobody knows  

Yes I come around  
Never know a little sooner

And every time you look my way

Tell me please, gypsy woman  
Casts a spell on me, darlin'  
Casts a spell on me, mama

That gypsy woman casts a spell on me  
  
But if you come runnin' with desire  
Oh, gypsy woman knows how to get your blood hot higher  
  
Well, asked your daddy  
Your papa wouldn't deny it  
Asked your mama  
Lord, she was quick to agree  
I didn't have to fight your brother  
And your sister's still standin' in line  
Oh, please tell me gypsy woman  
How do you hypnotize me?  
  
We're gonna go down to the river  
Walk in the water  
Oh, we're gonna get all clean  
Then we're gonna do, gonna do  
Exactly darlin' what you  
Came and set your mind on  
  
Casts a spell on me

Casts a spell on me, mama  
Casts a spell on me, darlin'.....

Sittin' in a Hong Kong bar  
Sweet dreams of you darling  
Ah when we were sweet sixteen  
Mama makin' love in the belly of an old freight train  
Life was so simple and easy  
Oh the sun went down  
You took care of the children darlin'  
Then you felt like movin' away,  
Lord now you didn't stand and stare  
You felt like movin' and leavin' darlin'  
Didn't I treat you fair  
It's all right now darlin'  
It's alright now darlin'

had a talk with my woman late last night  
And she reassured me everything was alright  
And time hung still like a falling rain  
Now i know at last that my love is safe  
Ah but when i go away my love i leave  
Lord i'm but half a man without her by my side  
She's this memory that i hold all around  
She's this dream that i always hold to believe  
  
I wanna go upon a mountain  
And sing my love and sing my love  
I wanna sing it high, sing it down low  
Then i'm gonna know how long it's gonna last  
Then i'm gonna know how long it's gonna last  
  
Well you know your moses, oh lord he lost his way  
Ah, and your jesus don't remember the words  
Well then i guess it's just you and me brother  
All alone in this cold world  
All alone in this cold world  
  
Ah, you gotta go upon a mountain  
And learn to sing your love, learn to sing your love  
You know i can sing it high, sing it down low  
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last  
Then we gonna know how long it's gonna last  
  
Hard rain, sweet rain, fall a little while longer  
Wash down the city skies  
Lord bring the streets alive  
Make it like it was long before i was born  

Here I am believin' words again  
Here I am tryin' to find your love again  
Here I am down on my knees again  
Prayin' for a love  
That we used to know  
  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to love  
And let it go  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to go on living that way  
When so few understand what it means  
To fall in love  
And so few know how hard it is to live without it  
I must have been blind  
I must have been blind  
Lord, I must have been blind  
  
To hold something real  
And not believe it  
To live in her life  
And never trustin'  
To give all you know and never feel it  
To hold back each day  
Until it dies away  
  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to love  
And let it go  
Both of us know  
How hard it is to go on  
Living that way  
When so few undersand what it means  
To fall in love  
And so few know how hard it is to live without it  
I must have been blind  
I must have been blind  
Lord, I must have been blind

O I never asked to be your mountain  
I never asked to fly  
Remember when you came to me  
And told me of his lies  
You didn't understand my love  
You don't know why I try  
And the rain was falling on that day  
And damn the reason why  
  
The Flying Pisces sails for time  
And tells me of my child  
Wrapped in bitter tales and heartache  
He begs for just a smile  
O he never asked to be her mountain  
He never asked to fly  
And through his eye he comes his love  
And tells her not to cry  
  
She says, "Your scoundrel father flies  
With a dancer called a queen  
And with her stolen cards he plays  
And laughs, but never wins"  
O the child dreams to be his hands  
In the counting of the rain  
But only barren breasts he feels  
For her milk will never drain  
  
As I die I can't remember  
Where I saw the rain:  
Could it be that her laughter  
Drove me down again?  
Charming dancer will you stop,  
Stop and talk to me?  
Is there someone else you feel  
In your dreams? you will, you see:  
In midnight gazes  
I've found you far from me:  
If you lead me on  
Please leave me down  
  
O Flying Flying Fish  
Please flutter by my door:  
Yes you can drink my lies  
If first you read my eyes:  
Each one is titled  
"I'm drowning back to you":  
I can't swim your waters  
And you can't walk my lands:  
I'm sailing all my sins  
And I'm climbing all my fears  
And soon now I'll fly  
  
O I never asked to be your mountain  
I never asked to fly  
Remember when you came to me  
And told me of his lies  
You didn't understand my love  
You don't know why I try  
And the rain was falling on that day  
And that's the reason why  
  
Sweet lover, will you come back  
And love me for a while?  
Please take my hand  
Leave all your fears behind  
  
I've been gone too long  
Now I'm home to stay  
Please don't leave me  
Again this way  
  
Please come home

Now the sun sits on my hand  
O where are you ?  
Walking the wind I fly above the shore of the town  
To the hills where I can hear  
The harbor bells ring slavery  
Where the fortune teller sighs to me  
O I see your woman in the raw  
Ride a mare of stone and howl  
  
I woke up  
While morning built  
The world with light,  
Crossing their hearts,  
Twelve sailor boys all stood in a ring  
Round our bed,  
And from the grass a dancer rose,  
Shivering,  
Oh the sailors pointing  
Out to sea  
And the dancer diving  
Up the sky  
'Til we forgot the day

I've been out walking  
I don't do too much talking these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think a lot  
About the things that I forgot to do  
And all the times I had the chance to  
  
I stopped my ramblin'  
I don't do too much gamblin' these days  
These days  
These days I seem to think about  
How all the changes came about my way  
And I wonder if I'll see another highway  
  
And I had a lover  
I don't think I'll risk another these days  
These days  
And if I seem to be afraid  
To live the life that I have made in song  
Well it's just 'cause I've been losing so long  
  
Well I'll stop my dreamin'  
I don't do too much schemin' these days  
These days  
These days I'll sit on cornerstones  
And count the time in quartertones to ten  
Please don't confront me with my failures  
I had not forgotten them  

O whither has my lady wandered?  
I'll search until I know I've found her  
One green day she left her wings  
And cut away her childhood strings  
But dropping smiles along the trail  
She left a trace I will not fail  
O whither has my lady wandered?  
I'll search until I know I've found her  
When I catch my sudden maid  
I'll deck her out in lace and jade  
I will take her to her room  
I will take her to her room  
I love her upstairs, I love her downstairs  
But I love my lady's chamber  
O whither has my lady wandered?  
I'll search until I know I've found her  

I went down to the meat rack tavern  
And found myself a big ol' healthy girl  
Now she was drinkin' alone  
Aw what a waste of sin  
So I went on over to sweet talk that girl  
Lord I moved on in  
Lord I whispered come on and move with me  
Move with me move with me move with me darlin'  
Aw don't be shy  
I'm gonna mess witcha, mess witcha, mess witcha,  
Mess witcha, mess witcha mind  
  
Well, I don't care if you tell me you're married  
Cause I can be your man when your husband ain't home  
Now if he should walk in you just tell him I'm your houseboy  
And that you just can't stand to sleep here alone...no more  
  
I want to move with you, move with you, move with you,  
Move with you darlin'  
I want to mess witcha mess witcha mess witcha  
Mess witcha mind  
  
Well now he finally walked in  
And Lord that man filled up the doorway  
Well he grabbed me by my throat  
And he bounced me down the stairs  
And Lord I swear, he broke every bone in my body  
But it was worth every second that I was there  
Cause she would whisper to me...  
  
Move with me, move with me, move with me,  
Move with me darlin'  
I'm gonna mess witcha, mess witcha, mess witcha,  
Mess witcha mind  
  
Well now I

I was a nighthawkin' in my taxi  
On a cruise below the deadline  
My fare was a shaky ol' lush  
So I kicked it over and took off  
Then he whipped out this switch blade  
Straight outta nowhere level to my throat  
He said "You ever been over to the war boy"  
I said "Man I was a combat paratrooper daddy"  
Well then he slump back cool and he pocket that steel  
He said "Take me down to Fourth and Main"  
Ah that paratroop bluff always cools oh the red eyed geezers down  
Man that last block that cat was singing  
Man he was sittin' in the backseat singing to me this song  
I got my BAR boy  
I got my M1 on my hip right  
You better listen mr president  
Oh boy don't you mess up with my war, boy  
I wanna do I wanna do  
Lord I wanna do the Blood Boogaloo  
I'm just a Redneck son of a gun  
I wanna kill me a gook before dawn  
Ah, night hawkin' for my change

Once I was a soldier  
And I fought on foreign sands for you  
Once I was a hunter  
And I brought home fresh meat for you  
Once I was a lover  
And I searched behind your eyes for you  
And soon there'll be another  
To tell you I was just a lie  
  
And sometimes I wonder  
Just for a while  
Will you remember me  
  
And though you have forgotten  
All of our rubbish dreams  
I find myself searching  
Through the ashes of our ruins  
For the days when we smiled  
And the hours that ran wild  
With the magic of our eyes  
And the silence of our words  
  
And sometimes I wonder  
Just for a while  
Will you remember me

If a fiddler played you a song, my love  
And if I gave you a wheel  
Would you spin for my heart and loneliness  
Would you spin for my love  
  
If I gave up all of my pride for you  
And only loved you for now  
Would you hide my fears and never say  
"Tomorrow I must go"  
  
Everywhere there's rain my love  
Everywhere there's fear  
  
If you tell me a lie I'll cry for you  
Tell me of sin and I'll laugh  
If you tell me of all the pain you've had  
I'll never smile again  
  
Everywhere there's rain my love  
Everywhere there's fear  
  
I can plainly see that our parts have changed  
Our sands are shifting around  
Need I beg to you for one more day  
To find our lonely love  
  
Everywhere there's rain my love  
Everywhere there's fear

You don't remember what to say  
You don't remember what to do  
You don't remember where to go  
You don't remember what to choose  
You wheel, you steal, you feel, you kneel down  
  
All the stony people  
Walking 'round in Christian licorice clothes  
I can't hesitate  
And I can't wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
The sunshine reminds you of concreted skies  
You thought you were flying but you opened your eyes  
And you found yourself falling back to yesterday's lies  
Hello, Pleasant Street, you know she's back again  
You wheel, you steal, you feel, you kneel down  
  
All the stony people  
Walking 'round in Christian licorice clothes  
I can't hesitate  
And I can't wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
At twilight your lover comes to your room  
He'll spin you, he'll weave you 'round his emerald loom  
And softly you'll whisper all around his ear  
"Sweet lover, I love Pleasant Street  
I wheel, I steal, I feel my way down to kneel"  
  
All the stony people  
Walking 'round in Christian licorice clothes  
I can't hesitate  
And I can't wait  
For Pleasant Street  
  
You don't remember what to say  
You don't remember what to do  
You don't remember which way to go  
You don't remember who to choose  
You wheel, you steal, you feel, you kneel down

She is the day that gives me time to live and ???? love my life.  
Till night comes on with sundown scythe to end the puzzle pantomime.  
She is a day of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.  
  
She is the bridge on which I wait to watch the river 'neath me flow.  
All spinning, surging far below  
???? ???? ?????  
She is a bridge of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.  
  
She is the air I breathe ?????  
Awake, asleep in ??? calm.  
A wind to wash my lifted palm,  
A sky that calls me out to dance.  
She is the air of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.  
  
She is the smile that keeps me warm with matchless laughter, eyes ablaze.  
A mischief mystery she plays upon the flute of early morn.  
She is a smile of love.  
  
She is the day through which I walk toward the bridge where she stands.  
She is the air I breathe to sing, she is a smile without demands.

In my heart is where I long for you  
In my smile I search for you  
Each time you turn and run away I cry inside  
My silly way, just too young to know any more  
  
In my world the devil dances and dares  
To leave my soul just anywhere,  
Until I find peace in this world  
I'll sing a song everywhere I can  
Just too young to know any more  
  
The wind covers me cold  
The starry skies all around my eyes  
Far behind the city moans  
Well worthy of the people there  
Oh, the psalms they love to hear  
  
So let me sing a song for you  
Just to help your day along  
Let me sing a song for you  
One I've known so very long  
Oh, please could you find the time.

Oh, I don't get no letters  
Nobody calls  
Nobody comes 'round here no more  
No pretty ladies  
Nor pretty boys  
Nobody comes 'round my door no more  
  
It's just lonely, yeah  
Mama you don't know  
It's just lonely, yeah  
Mama you don't know  
  
Cops treat ya dirty  
And the children treat ya mean  
This is the lowest town I've ever seen  
People keep draggin' their bodies around  
Ain't enough pride to even look around  
  
It's just lonely, yeah  
Mama you don't know  
It's just lonely, yeah  
Mama you don't know  
  
Now honey you got on little light  
Now you keep it burning bright  
If you keep it lit every night  
Someday a good man come and make it alright  
  
It's just so lonely, yeah  
Mama you don't know  
It's just lonely, yeah  
Mama you don't know

You've got the untortured mind of a woman  
Who has answered all the questions before  
You've got the free-givin' ways of a woman  
Who has kicked all the heartache out the door  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
I brought to you my tired plans and wearied faith to you  
And with a smile you took me in and showed me love again  
Now it has to be say goodbye or stay that I don't know  
But remember please I gave you love that's only mine to give  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Yes, I truly love to be with you  
If I wasn't with the one that I'm with  
Yes, I truly love to lie by you  
If I didn't have to give what I give  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
I brought to you my tired plans and wearied faith to you  
And with a smile you took me in and showed me love again  
Now it has to be say goodbye or stay that I don't know  
But remember please I gave you love that's only mine to give  
And Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  
Jainie, don't you know?  
Jainie, don't you know I been tryin'?  

When I sing I can't bring everything on the wing  
Flying down from dizzy air  
To the ground because I care  
You will be love and your love will live  
When I smile I beguile all the while every mile  
As I walk across the sky  
Of the clockwork of your eye  
You will be love and your love will live  
Casting spells from the well I can tell you the bells  
Listen to my magic voice  
Learn the tune of children's toys  
You will be love and your love will live  
When I die do not cry hear my sigh passing by  
After I have turned to win  
I will try to help you then  
You will be love and your love will live  
  
  

Long afloat on shipless oceans  
I did all my best to smile  
'Til your singing eyes and fingers  
Drew me loving to your isle  
  
And you sang, "Sail to me, sail to me, let me enfold you"  
Here I am, here I am waiting to hold you  
  
Did I dream you dreamed about me?  
Were you hare when I was fox?  
Now my foolish boat is leaning  
Broken lovelorn on your rocks  
  
For you sing, "Touch me not, touch me not, come back tomorrow"  
Oh my heart, oh my heart shies from the sorrow  
  
I'm as puzzled as The Oyster (alt. 'as a newborn child')  
I'm as troubled as the tide  
Should I stand amid the breakers?  
Or should I lie with death my bride?  
Hear me sing, "Swim to me, swim to me, let me enfold you"  
Oh my heart, oh my heart is waiting to hold you

Oh now my brother's been taken away  
Gone are the old times when we used to say  
Oh a woman was younger she knew what to do  
Oh but I look around me, now that's not so  
  
I'm lost on that open road no peace do I find  
Maybe the wind'll blow a melody and ease my mind  
  
But soon love is broken, they'll take you away  
Oh the wars they been growing as no relief  
And the old men who ruled them oh they're just like thieves  
They rob from the sunshine, oh the air ain't so clean  
Our rivers are dirty where once we could see  
  
A smile from your lady friend looking down  
Look at that river hey did you ever shiver  
Well the earth is broken there is no one to save  
  
I remember quite freely only yesterday  
Ah the letter that I read from you read this way  
Take care lonesome Timmy, ah don't you start  
Thinking you're the only one year that's gone  
Out on your lonesome road hey lend a hand to your friend  
Yes he's just as lonely and the wind keeps you cold  
  
Remember the rivers that once did flow clean  
  
Ah sometimes I wonder how this old world keeps spinning 'round  
All the old folks have gone west, Lord preparing to die  
All except for a few of us hangers on  
Living each day with trivial hearts  
  
We just stop once in a while cry over the news  
In some foreign far city your brother's shot down  
  
Because there was a reason a gun had a hand  
And the old man killed youth, squeezed down its hope  
Now I'm just waiting brother waiting for the land  
Soon in my country there won't be a friend  
Each one is trying so hard to defend  
That one one last heartbeat before he's tugged away  
  
Lost in the mechanized efficient world logical skies  
  
Ah but no song was written on without a tear in your eyes  
Are we the last ones, the last ones to try

I live by the river  
And I hide my house away  
Then just like the river  
I can change my ways  
Oh, if you come to love me  
You would stay forever  
Inside my heart  
Inside my dreams  
And time will fade  
In time we'll love  
  
In the street we walk as beggars  
In the alley faithless kings  
Ah, but it's the truth of life  
That chains us in between  
Those lost moments we steal  
To keep our love alive  
And our prize so tired after all the pain  
And time will fade  
In time we'll love

Ah, tell me mama  
Ah, tell me darlin'  
Now that it's time for me to go  
Ah, don't you hold me down  
And kill the man you love  
Sweet mama what you gonna do  
Ah, now darlin' what you gonna do  
Mama what you gonna do for love  
Ah, when that sun shines  
Ah, honey  
And I'm living in your love again  
Ah, won't you let me know  
Do I stay or do I go  
Oh, yeah,  
Ah, darlin', what you gonna do now  
I said now mama what you gonna do  
Now mama what you gonna do for love  
When I'm gone  
When I'm gone  
When I'm gone  
When I'm gone  
Ah, when I'm gone  
Gone gone gone gone gone gone  
When I'm gone  
  
Darlin' so young and tender,  
So quick to surrender  
Everything that you don't own,  
Know that you've got not  
You make love like a skinned cat  
Crawlin' across a highway  
Tryin' to git to the other side,  
Don't know why you just gotta try  
  
Ah, when that devil  
When that devil gets you honey  
Oh, I want to know  
That's when I'll come home and start to  
  
Ah, sweet mama what you gonna do  
Ah, sweet mama what you gonna do now  
Aw Daddy what you gonna do for love  
  
When I'm gone, when I'm gone, when I'm gone, Lord  
When I'm gone, gone, gone, mama, when I'm gone  
When I'm gone, yeah, sweet mama,  
Yes, ah, when I'm gone  
Get that devil get that devil  
Gonna go back home, so long,  
Just want to get some sun on my shoulder  
And get a bit of sand in my shoes  
I love you New York City, but I see that sun shinin'  
And I don't want to stay here no more  
Oh, what you gonna do  
Oh yeah...

They told me all the hymns were born  
Out of the saxophone,  
And I went down to test them all  
Beneath the Tijuana moon,  
I saw violence in the moon  
Two broken lovers strong and strewn,  
I drank myself into a dream:  
  
Tijuana moon,  
My daddy Tijuana moon,  
Oh my darlin',  
Tijuana moon Lord my daddy  
Tijuana moon  
  
You can keep the Texas blues,  
Tequila and the burning stone,  
But my amigo  
Nothin's good against the Tijuana moon  
  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon  
Talk about lovin' Tijuana moon  
Talk about daddy Tijuana moon

As she walks near me my blood feels the chance  
All spinning and swirling it yearns for the dance  
To become part of me poor one to take part of her  
  
Don't say that tomorrow will bring me her love  
Don't let me wait for words undestined from above  
Let me laugh through her fingers and smile through her hair  
Let me love the one I see for I know that she's there  
For tomorrow and today aren't here anymore  
  
Lalalalala  
Sing songs for pennies tip my hat couldn't get many  
All around the city are the troubadours  
  
Lalalalala  
Sing songs for pennies tip my hat couldn't get many  
All around the city see the troubadours  
  
Singing songs sadly sing songs so lonely  
All around the city see the troubadours  
  
As she steps near me my blood feels the chance  
All spinning and whirling it yearns for the dance  
To take part of her fair one  
To know part of her

  
Now I woke up this morning yes there was rubbling in my mind  
I was thinking about my baby I left her so far behind  
Oh now I wonder Lord I wonder deep in my heart

Although you've spoken many times before  
A sight of birth he leaves you by a door  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And all you need is the warmth of his hand  
And if he'd smile your loving blood would dance  
One silent kiss leaves you in a trance  
And now you know you cannot live alone  
But you will find your future is unknown  
One day the questions rise, on wings of chance you fly  
And on that day your laughs and tears will die  
And fall as free as seabirds climb the skies  
And you will love when love comes your way  
And when it comes there's nothing more to say  
And now you know he doesn't understand  
And now you know you don't need his hand  
One day the questions die, on wings of chance you fly
