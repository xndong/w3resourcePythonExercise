Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing  
If I can come through than so can you  
And you will find there's no regretting  
Things you want from your life's font  
Will never let your spirit roam  
Come back to Earth for what it's worth  
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home  
  
[Chorus]  
I've been doing my best  
What else can I do?  
Is there something I've missed  
That will help you through  
  
I have reached the top of the wall  
And all I've found is another way to fall  
  
For some short time  
For a while you and I were joined to eternity  
Then we split in two back tome and you  
Like the rain rising from the sea  
Rising from the sea  
We all can see what we shall be  
But knowing's not really controlling  
With time perhaps I will pass the traps and find some peace and understanding  
After you'd come and while you're gone  
You leave me guessing, it's depressing  
Never to know the way to go to find some time along a little less pressing  
So you just have to laugh  
When it hurts so much  
You're so far away and so hard to touch  
  
I have reached the top of the wall  
And all I've found is another way to fall  
  
Since it began I got one dream and it's really my only blessing  
If I can come through than so can you  
And you will find there's no regretting  
Things you want from your life's font  
Will never let your spirit roam  
Come back to Earth for what it's worth  
For you've been dreaming of a ceiling not a home  
  
[Chorus]

Like the rose that blooms in the wintertime  
As it reaches up through the snow  
The more life keeps apart  
The more love will grow  
Like the seed that grows in the darkness  
As it reaches up to the sun  
I will always reach out for you  
Cause you are the one  
  
I bless the wings that bring you back to me  
Back across the shore  
If I could touch you now my darling  
And love you just once more  
If I could hold you, hold you, hold you,  
I know you'd understand,  
I know you'd understand.  
  
As I cross the bridge by the waterfall  
As I make my way by the stars  
There's a shadow walking beside me  
Here in my heart  
Like the restless wind in the tree tops  
Like a whispered voice in my ear  
I will always be there for you  
I'll always be here  
  
I bless the wings that bring you back to me  
Back across the shore  
If I could touch you now my darling  
And love you just once more  
If I could hold you, hold you, hold you,  
I know you'd understand,  
I know you'd understand.  
  
In a far off wonderland  
That flashes past my eyes  
The kiss of inspiration that was mine  
The dust of many centuries  
Has blown across this land  
But love will not be scattered by the sand  
  
Like the sunrise over the mountainside  
Like the bird that has to be free  
There's a part of you that will always be  
Part of me  
Like the seed that grows in the darkness  
I will always reach out for you  
Cause you are the one  
  
I bless the wings that bring you back to me  
Back across the shore  
If I could touch you now my darling  
And love you just once more  
If I could hold you, hold you, hold you,  
I know you'd understand,  
I know you'd understand,  
I know you'd understand,  
I know you'd understand.

Heart and soul took control  
Took control of me  
Paid my dues, spread the news  
Hands across the sea  
Put me down, turned me round  
Turned me 'round to see  
Marble halls, open doors  
Someone found the key  
And it's only what you do  
That keeps coming back on you  
And it's only what you say  
That can give yourself away  
Underground sight and sound  
Human symphony  
Heard the voice, had no choice  
Needed to be free  
Fly me high, touch the sky  
Left the earth below  
Heard the line, saw the sign  
Knew which way to go  
'cause it's easier to try  
Than to prove it can't be done  
And it's easier to stay  
Than to turn around and run  
It's a blue world  
It takes somebody to help somebody  
Oh, it's a blue world  
It's a new world  
It needs somebody to love somebody  
Oh, it's a blue world  
Heart and soul took control  
Took control of me  
Paid my dues, spread the news  
Hands across the sea  
Put me down, turned me round  
Turned me round to see  
Marble halls, open doors  
Someone found the key  
And it's only what you do  
That keeps coming back on you  
And it's only what you say  
That can give yourself away  
'cause it's easier to try  
Than to prove it can't be done  
And it's easier to stay  
Than to turn around and run  
It's a blue world  
It takes somebody to help somebody  
Oh, it's a blue world  
It's a new world  
It needs somebody to love somebody  
Oh, it's a blue world  
It's a blue world  
It takes somebody to help somebody  
Oh, it's a blue world  
It's a new world  
It needs somebody to love somebody  
Oh, it's a blue world  

She said she'd come, she didn't  
I'm the one in love, she isn't  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
It's a sad day in Paris  
With no girl by my side  
Got to feeling so badly  
Like a part of me died  
It would have been  
So good to see her  
I never thought  
She wouldn't be there  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
Oh, I wish I knew her better  
It's not easy to forget her  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
It's a sad day in Paris  
With no girl by my side  
Got to feeling so badly  
Like a part of me died  
It would have been  
So good to see her  
I never thought  
She wouldn't be there  
There's no girl standing there  
And there's no one who cares  
And the trees are so bare  
On the Boulevard de la Madeleine  
  

Is that the wind  
On your face?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Feel the chill  
Of an empty space.  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is that your heart you hear  
Or a train to nowhere,  
That pounding in your ear?  
  
Have you reached your breaking point?  
Have you reached your breaking point tonight?  
  
Only when you're sleeping can you drift away.  
No one can hurt you.  
Listen to the secret of your dreams.  
Though you want to sleep forever  
Still you must return  
  
Hands of ice  
Down your spine.  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
  
Feel the grip  
Of a clinging vine.  
Are you sure you're alone?  
Are you sure you're alone?  
  
In the middle of the night  
Is that your voice I hear  
Or the wind that's calling  
Back across the years?  
  
Have you reached your breaking point?  
Have you reached your breaking point tonight?

Something you can't hide  
Says you're lonely  
Hidden deep inside  
Of you only  
It's there for you to see  
Take a look and be  
Burn slowly the candle of life  
  
Something there outside  
Says we're only  
In the hands of time  
Falling slowly  
It's there for us to know  
With love that we can go  
Burn slowly the candle of life  
  
So love everybody  
And make them your friend  
So love everybody  
And make them your friend  
  
Something you can't hide  
Says you're lonely  
Hidden deep inside  
Of you only  
It's there for you to see  
Take a look and be  
Burn slowly the candle of life  
  
Something there outside  
Says we're only  
In the hands of time  
Falling slowly  
It's there for us to know  
With love that we can go  
Burn slowly the candle of life

Dawn is a feeling,  
A beautiful ceiling.  
The smell of grass  
Just makes you pass  
Into a dream.  
You're here today,  
No future fears,  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to.  
You look around you,  
Things they astound you  
So breathe in deep,  
You're not asleep,  
Open your mind.  
You're here today,  
No future fears,  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to.  
Do you understand  
That all over this land  
There's a feeling?  
In minds far and near  
Things are becoming clear  
With a meaning.  
Now that you're knowing  
Pleasure starts flowing.  
It's true life flies  
Faster than eyes  
Could ever see.  
You're here today.  
No future fears.  
This day will last  
A thousand years  
If you want it to.

Rise, let us see you,  
Dawning is the day.  
Miss, misty meadow,  
You will find your way.  
Wake up in the morning, to yourself,  
And leave this crazy life behind you.  
Listen, we're trying to find you.  
Flow to the sea,  
You know where to go.  
But still we are free,  
No one tells the wind which way to blow.  
Wake up in the morning to yourself,  
Open your eyes and start to be you.  
Listen, we think we can see you.  
Baby there's no price upon your head,  
Sing it, shout it,  
Now the angry words have all been said,  
Do it, don't doubt it.  
So rise, let us see you,  
Dawning is the day.  
Miss, misty meadow,  
You will find your way.  
Wake up in the morning to yourself,  
Open your head and look around you.  
Listen, we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we have found you.  
Listen we think we can see you.  

Dear diary, what a day it's been  
Dear diary, it's been just like a dream  
Woke up too late. Wasn't where I should have been  
For goodness sake, what's happening to me?  
Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary  
  
It was cold outside my door  
So many people by the score  
Rushing around as senselessly  
They don't notice there's people like me  
Write lightly, yours truly, dear diary  
  
They don't know what they're playing  
They've got no way of knowing what the game is  
Still they carry on doing what they can  
Outside me, yours truly, dear diary  
  
It's over. Will tomorrow be the same?  
I know that they're really not to blame  
If they weren't so blind, then surely they'd see  
There's a much better way for them to be  
Inside me, yours truly, dear diary  
  
Somebody exploded an H-bomb today  
But it wasn't anyone I knew

Every time I hear the sound of the rain  
Beating on my roof again  
I want to taste your love  
And I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.  
Every time I lift my eyes to the sky  
Something in my heart asks why.  
I want to know the truth  
And I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.  
  
Like the footprints  
Disappearing from the sand,  
I try to catch the thought.  
It slips right through my hand  
And, as the darkness  
Throws it's cloak upon the ground,  
I start to run to you.  
I've got to take you down,  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.  
  
Every time I feel I'm losing my way  
The power of your love remains.  
I want to touch your love  
An' I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep. deep.  
I want to go deep, deep.  
I want to go deep.

Ask the mirror on the wall  
Who's the biggest fool of all,  
Bet you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
See the world  
Ask what's it for,  
Understanding, nothing more,  
Don't you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
Time is now to spread your voice,  
Time's to come there'll be no choice,  
Why do you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
Look at progress,  
Then count the cost,  
We'll spoil the seas  
With the rivers we've lost.  
  
See the writing on the wall,  
Hear the mirror's warning call.  
That's why you feel small,  
It happens to us all.  
  
Ask the mirror on the wall  
Who's the biggest fool of all,  
Bet you feel small,  
It happens to us all.

Doctor Livingston, I presume  
Stepping out of the jungle gloom  
Into the midday sun  
What did you find there?  
Did you stand a while and stare?  
Did you meet anyone?  
I've seen butterflies galore  
I've seen people big and small  
I've still not found what I'm looking for  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
Captain Scott, you were so bold  
Now you're looking rather cold  
Out there in the snow  
What did you find there?  
Did you stand a while and stare?  
Did you meet anyone?  
I've seen polar bears and seals  
I've seen giant Antarctic eels  
I've still not found what I'm looking for  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
Columbus where are you bound?  
So you think the world is round  
Sailed off in the blue  
What did you find there?  
Did you stand a while and stare?  
Did you meet anyone?  
There are Indians by the score  
In many places that I saw  
I've still not found what I'm looking for  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  
We're all, we're all, we're all looking for someone  
We're all looking for someone  

Hark listen here he comes  
Hark listen here he comes  
Turning, spinning, Catherine wheeling  
For ever changing  
There's no beginning  
Speeding through a charcoal sky  
Observe the truth we cannot hide  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there?  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind  
  
You'll see us all around  
You'll see us all around  
Turning, spinning, Catherine wheeling  
For ever changing  
There's no beginning  
You're so very far from home  
And so very much alone  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there?  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind  
  
Traveling eternity road  
What will you find there?  
Carrying your heavy load  
Searching to find a piece of mind

Evening has come to pass,  
The time of day doesn't last.  
Evening, has earned it's place today,  
I'm tired of working away.  
  
Working, living it brings,  
Only way to have those things.  
Toiling has bought too many tears,  
Turn 'round all those past years.  
  
Evening time to get away.  
Evening time to get away.  
Evening time to get away.  
'Til next day.  
  
Live all you people, you can't see where you're at,  
It doesn't really hurt you, so that can't be bad.  
  
Live all you people, you can't see where you're at,  
It doesn't really hurt you, so that can't be bad.  
  
Evening time to get away.  
Evening time to get away.

Listen, hear the sound  
The child awakes  
Wonder all around  
The child awakes  
Now in his life, he never must be lost  
No thoughts must deceive him  
In life he must trust  
With the eyes of a child  
You must come out and see  
That your world's spinning 'round  
And through life you will be  
A small part of a hope  
Of a love that exists  
In the eyes of a child you will see  
Earth falls far away  
New life awaits  
Time it has no day  
New life awaits  
Here is your dream  
And now how does it feel?  
No words will go with you  
And now what is real?  
With the eyes of a child  
You must come out and see  
That your world's spinning 'round  
And through life you will be  
A small part of a hope  
Of a love that exists  
In the eyes of a child you will see  

I'm gonna sit and watch the web  
That you will build this day  
Will it be a thread of love you weave  
Is yours too short away  
Then everything will be as you will see in the light  
  
In the eyes of the child  
You must come out and see  
That your world's spinning 'round  
And through life you will be  
A small part  
Of a hope  
Of a love  
That exists  
In the eyes of a child you will see  
  
In the eyes of the child  
You must come out and see...

Floating free as a bird  
Sixty foot leaps it's so absurd  
From up here you should see the view  
Such a lot of space for me and you  
  
Oh you'd like it  
Gliding around get your feet off the ground  
Oh you'd like it  
Do as you please with so much ease  
  
Now I know how it feels  
To have wings on my heels  
To take a stroll among the stars  
Get a close look at planet Mars  
  
Oh you'd like it  
Gliding around get your feet off the ground  
Oh you'd like it  
Do as you please with so much ease  
  
Bouncing about on the moon  
Guess you'll all be up here soon  
The candy stores they'll be brand new  
And you'll buy a rock with the moon right through  
  
Oh you'd like it  
Gliding around get your feet off the ground  
Oh you'd like it  
Do as you please with so much ease  
  
Come fly...  
Come fly...  
Come fly...

We ran through the summer fields  
Between the earth and sky  
Little did we realize  
We were flying you and I  
We sang to the stars above  
We praised the earth below  
You fell into my arms that night  
And I've never let you go  
It was beautiful, glorious  
We were riding on a wave  
With foolish hearts and foolish love  
We would give ourselves away  
Remember how we cried out loud  
Heard angry voices shout  
I love you as I loved you then  
No danger and no doubt  
It was beautiful, glorious  
We were riding on a wave  
With foolish hearts and foolish love  
We would give ourselves away  
And now as we look behind  
To see the road of life  
Turning to the ones we love  
Salvation is in sight  
'Cause it was beautiful, glorious  
We were riding on a wave  
With foolish hearts and foolish love  
We would give ourselves away  
Remember how we cried out loud  
Heard angry voices shout  
I love you as I loved you then  
No danger and no doubt  

My boat sails stormy seas  
Battles oceans filled with tears  
At last my port's in view  
Now that I've discovered you  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady  
  
As life goes drifting by  
Like a breeze she'll gently sigh  
And slowly bow her head  
Then you'll hear her softly cry.  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady  
  
Words that you say when we're alone  
Though actions speak louder than words  
But all I can say is I love you so  
To drive away all my hurt  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady  
  
Set sail before the sun  
Feel the warmth that's just begun  
Share each and every dream  
They belong to everyone.  
  
Oh I'd give my life so lightly  
For my gentle lady  
Give it freely and completely  
To my lady

The summer sun is fading as the year grows old  
And darker days are drawing near  
The winter winds will be much colder  
Now you're not here.  
I watch the birds fly south across the autumn sky  
And one by one they disappear.  
I wish that I was flying with them  
Now you're not here  
  
Like a song through the trees you came to love me  
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  
  
Through autumn's golden gown we used to kick our way  
You always loved this time of year.  
Those fallen leaves lie undisturbed now  
Cause you're not here  
  
Like a song through the trees you came to love me  
Like a leaf on a breeze you blew away  
  
A gentle rain falls softly on my weary eyes  
As if to hide a lonely tear  
My life will be forever autumn  
'Cause you're not here!

If we could live forever  
Where would our dreams lead us to  
Living in a world of ever  
Changing expectation  
If it could be  
If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If we could be here forever  
Where in this world would heaven be  
As we race across the universe  
In search of confirmation  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be  
Why can't it be forever now  
There's no way out  
There is no return  
There's no way back  
There's no way to learn  
The final act  
The curtain falls  
On the stage  
On the stage  
Standing at the crossroads  
Waiting for the new millennium  
For if it could be  
If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If we could live forever  
Where would our dreams lead us to  
Living in a children's world  
Of simple fascination  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now  
For if it could be, if it could be  
It would be forever now  
If it could be, If it could be  
It would be forever now  

Long time no see  
Short time for you and me  
So fine, so good  
We're on the road  
Like you knew we would  
  
First night, so long  
A state of mind  
What can go wrong  
We're here, the time is right  
To rock 'n' roll  
Right through the night  
  
Make it work out  
Make it work  
Make it work out  
Make it work out  
For each other tonight  
  
Stage fright, candle light  
You can't let go  
Tonight's the night  
Came back for you  
Glad to see  
That you came too  
  
There's a place a Gemini dream  
There's no escaping from the love we have seen  
So come with me, turn night today  
You gonna wake up  
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream  
  
Turned round to see  
Where we've been  
And what we believe  
In life, love  
Take a chance  
See it through  
You'll be glad  
That you came too  
  
There's a place a Gemini dream  
There's no escaping from the love we have seen  
So come with me, turn night to day  
You gonna wake up  
You know you gonna wake up in a Gemini dream  
  
Long time no see  
The lights go up  
For you and me  
We're here  
The time is right  
To rock 'n' roll  
Right through the night  
  
Living it  
Believing it  
Wanting it  
Make it work out  
Make it work  
Make it work out  
Make it work out  
For each other tonight  
  
Long time no see  
Short time for you and me  
So fine so far so good  
We're on the road  
Like you knew we would

My life is not as easy as you say  
My life is not anything but as the day  
My life is surrounded by the things of the day that have gone  
My world is built on everything that I want can be won  
  
Gimme' a little somethin' to help me on my way [Repeat: x2]  
  
My heart is not as cold as you can say  
My heart is not anything but as the day  
My heart is warmed by the way that you love and are gone  
My life is founded on the thoughts that we two are just one  
  
Gimme' a little somethin' to help me on my way [Repeat: x5]

A gypsy of a strange and distant time  
Travelling in panic all direction blind  
Aching for the warmth of a burning sun  
Freezing in the emptiness of where he'd come from  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Left without a hope of coming home.  
Speeding through a shadow of a million years  
Darkness is the only sound to reach his ears  
Frightening him with the visions of eternity  
Screaming for the future that can never be  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Left without a hope of coming home.  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
A gypsy of a strange and distant time  
Travelling in panic all direction blind  
Aching for the warmth of a burning sun  
Freezing in the emptiness of where he'd come from  
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh oh oh oh oh  
Left without a hope of coming home.  
Left without a hope of coming home  
Left without a hope of coming home  

What mattered to me was the right to be free  
Like I'll be someday  
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way  
The places I've seen and the roads in between  
Make me wonder why  
I'm searching for my dreams up in the sky  
I heard the call  
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall  
And I had to fall in love with you  
The face that I've known seems so lost and alone  
When you're far away  
I'm comin' for you baby right away  
The places I've seen and the roads in between  
Make me wonder why  
I'm searching for me dreams up in the sky  
I heard the call  
In the mirror I saw the writing on the wall  
And I had to fall in love with you  
What mattered to me was the right to be free  
Like I'll be someday  
I'm waiting for my heart to lead the way  

So this is Christmas and what have you done,  
Another year over, a new one just begun.  
  
And so this is Christmas, I hope you have fun,  
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fears.  
  
And so this is Christmas for weak and for strong,  
The rich and the poor ones, the road is so long.  
  
And so happy Christmas for black and for white  
For the yellow and red ones let's stop all the fights.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.  
  
And so this is Christmas and what have we done  
Another year over, a new one just begun.  
  
And so happy Christmas we hope you have fun  
The near and the dear ones, the old and the young.  
  
A very merry Christmas and a happy New Year  
Let's hope it's a good one without any fear.  
  
War is over if you want it, war is over now.

I really miss you when the nights are long  
And only silence is heard in this world of song  
But life goes on  
And forever more  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
I see you walking through the gates of home  
And then I wake up to find  
I'm still all alone  
I should have known  
But forever more  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
Lonely is the river  
As it tumbles to the ocean  
Searching for our future  
We can find our way back home  
  
My only comfort is the love we share  
And as I walk through this world  
With sadness everywhere  
I've had my share  
And forever more,  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
And forever more,  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
Standing in the doorway  
As the sunrise greets the morning  
Searching for our future  
We can find our way back home  
  
I really miss you when the nights are long  
And only silence is heard in this world of song  
But life goes on  
And forever more  
Ill be haunted by your love  
  
Haunted by your love  
Haunted by your love  
Haunted by your love  
Haunted by your love

Part 1  
Now you know that you are real,  
Show your friends that you and me  
Belong to the same world,  
Turned on to the same word,  
Have you heard?  
Now you know that you are free,  
Living all your life at ease.  
Each day has its always,  
A look down life's hallways, doorways,  
To lead you there.  
  
[The Voyage]  
Part 2  
Now you know how nice it feels,  
Scatter good seed in the fields.  
Life's ours for the making,  
Eternity's waiting, waiting,  
For you and me.  
Now you know that you are real,  
Show your friends that you and me  
Belong to the same world,  
Turned on to the same word,  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?  
Have you heard?

Somewhere in the night  
There's a heart that beats so fast  
I can feel the heat  
Of the fire in your eyes,  
Burning like a naked flame,  
Waiting for the ice to break,  
Counting down the days,  
Waiting for the weekend  
Lonely is the night.  
Silence is a friend to walk with,  
With no one else to talk to.  
  
But, on a Friday night,  
It's alright, it's alright.  
You can be who you want to be.  
Take off for the weekend.  
If you can dance you can dance with me  
'cause it's Friday night.  
  
It's alright, it's alright.  
Nothing's gonna stop me now.  
I'm all wired up and ready to go,  
I'm on my way.  
Let's get on with the show  
  
Here comes the weekend.  
Here comes the weekend.  
  
Somewhere in the heat  
There's a heart that beats so fast  
I can hear your voice:  
Talk to me tonight.  
Taking a different face  
Every time I hear your name.  
I'm counting down the days  
Waiting for the weekend  
  
Lonely is the night  
When all are sleeping.  
Silence is a friend you walk with,  
With no one else to talk to  
  
But, on a Friday night,  
It's alright, it's alright.  
You can be who you want to be.  
Take off for the weekend.  
If you dance you can dance with me  
'cause it's Friday night.  
It's alright, it's alright.  
  
Nothing's gonna stop me now,  
I'm all wired up and ready to go  
And I'm on my way.  
It's the weekend  
And it's starting today.  
  
Here comes the weekend.  
Here comes the weekend.

Blasting, billowing, bursting forth  
With the power of ten billion butterfly sneezes  
Man with his flaming pyre  
Has conquered the wayward breezes  
  
Climbing to tranquility  
Far above the cloud  
Conceiving the heavens  
Clear of misty shroud  
  
Higher and higher  
Now we've learned to play with fire  
Go higher and higher and higher  
  
Vast vision must improve our sight  
Perhaps at last we'll see and end  
To our homes endless blight  
And the beginning of the free  
  
Climb to tranquility  
Finding its real worth  
Conceiving the heavens  
Florishing on earth  
  
Higher and higher  
Now we've learned to play with fire  
Go higher and higher and higher

It's a long, long highway  
Will this road of life lead me to someone  
Who sees the world in a grain of sand  
Who holds the future in the palm of their hand, aaah  
  
No one else can see things like I do  
It's a long, long highway  
Looking for a home where the seed was sown  
And the harvest was young  
  
Will this road of life lead me to someone, someone  
The rays of sun and the light of dawn  
My inspriation since the day I was born, aaah  
No one else can see things like I do  
  
It's a long, long highway  
But don't make the start on an empty heart  
When you think you've begun  
Let the road of life lead you to someone, someone  
  
Nothing is serious to me  
I live for what will be (listen to me)  
I can always be a dreamer  
So trust your heart  
  
Don't fall apart  
You'll see  
At your journey's end  
You will find a friend in me  
  
It's a long, long highway  
Will this road of life lead me to someone  
You touched the dream that was in your eyes  
You took so long only to realize oooh  
  
No one else can love you like I do  
It's a long, long highway  
Looking for a home where the seed was sown  
And my harvest was young  
  
Will this road of life lead me to someone  
It's a long, long highway  
But don't make a start  
On an empty heart  
  
It's a long, long highway  
Let this road of life lead you to someone, someone

I see the headlights  
Shining on the wall  
It seems, I've got a visitor  
Who is kind enough to call  
And I hope and pray, everyday  
I hope and pray, it's you  
I thought I heard some footsteps  
On the floor  
And tell me, am I dreaming  
Or is someone at the door?  
And I hope and pray, everyday  
I hope and pray, it's you  
Autumn turns to winter  
And winter turns to spring  
I only know the passing  
Of the days  
And if you were to ask me  
'Bout the meaning of my life  
It kind of lost it's meaning  
On the day you went away  
You know that when it comes  
To matters of the heart  
I thought I had it covered  
But it's tearing me apart  
And I hope and pray, everyday  
I hope and pray, it's you  
Autumn turns to winter  
And winter turns to spring  
The summer sun still lingers  
In my head  
If it wasn't for the letters  
That you wrote me from the heart  
I'd sometimes wonder, baby  
If I dreamed it all instead  
You see, I've got to feel your hand  
Upon my face  
I need to get the calling  
To rejoin the human race  
And I hope and pray, every day  
I hope and pray, it's you  
I hope and pray, every day  
I hope and pray, it's you, yeah  
Yeah, I hope and pray, every day  
I hope and pray, it's you  

Walking thru that door  
Outside we came  
Nowhere at all  
Perhaps the answers here  
Not there anymore  
  
Then in our hearts the light broke thru  
A path lost for years is there in view  
House of four doors  
You'll be lost now forever  
House of four doors  
Rest of life's life forever.  
House of four doors  
You'll be lost now forever  
House of four doors  
Rest of life's life forever.

How is it we are here, on this path we walk,  
In this world of pointless fear, filled with empty talk,  
Descending from the apes as scientist-priests all think,  
Will they save us in the end, we're trembling on the brink.  
  
Men's mighty mine-machines digging in the ground,  
Stealing rare minerals where they can be found.  
Concrete caves with iron doors, bury it again,  
While a starving frightened world fills the sea with grain.  
  
Her love is like a fire burning inside,  
Her love is so much higher it can't be denied,  
She sends us her glory, it's always been there,  
Her love's all around us, it's there for you and me to share.  
  
Men's mighty mine-machines digging in the ground,  
Stealing rare minerals where they can be found.  
Concrete caves with iron doors, bury it again,  
While a starving frightened world fills the sea with grain.  
  
How is it we are here  
How is it we are here  
How is it we are here

I don't mind your love  
I don't mind the one you're thinking of  
'Cause I know, baby I know  
You're going to miss me  
I don't mind, he loves you so  
I don't mind, it can't grow cold  
'Cause I know, baby I know  
You're going to miss me  
Baby, tell me what you've got to say  
I don't mind, this is all of my song  
I don't mind, goodbye, so long  
'Cause I know, I know  
You're going to miss me  
Baby, can you ever let me go?  
You know, you know that I love you so  
Why'd you ever leave me?  
Why'd you ever leave me?  
Oh, so we will die

Oh, I dreamed last night I was hearing, hearing your voice  
And the things that you said well they left me, left me no choice  
And you told me we had the power  
And you told me this was the hour  
That you don't know how if I could show you now  
Well, I dreamed last night you were calling, calling my name  
You were locked inside of you secrets calling my name  
And you told me lost was the key  
And you told me how you long to be free  
That you don't know how, oh, let me show you now  
Like a bird on a far distant mountain  
Like a ship on an uncharted sea  
You are lost in the arms that have found you  
Don't be afraid, love's plans are made, oh don't be afraid  
If there's a time and a place to begin love  
It must be now, let it go, set it free  
Oh, I dreamed last night I was hearing, hearing your voice  
Why did you say those things that have left me, left me no choice?  
When you told me we had the power  
Why did you tell me now was the hour?  
But you don't know how, oh, let me show you now  
Like a bird on a far distant mountain  
Like a ship on an uncharted sea  
You are lost in the arms that have found you  
Oh, don't be afraid, love's plans are made, don't be afraid  
If there's a time and a place to begin love  
It must be now, let it go, set it free  
Oh, I dreamed last night I was hearing, hearing your voice  

The indestructible has broken down,  
The undeniable is turned around  
And I don't care, my love,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.  
The unbelievable has all come true,  
I love the changes that you've put me through  
And I don't care, you see,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.  
  
I see the magic  
That we're making now  
And a veil is lifted  
From my eyes, somehow,  
And the most amazing thing  
That comes to light  
Is the world looks different  
To me overnight.  
  
My friends will tell you  
That I've lost my cool,  
The lovesick schoolboy  
Turning up for school  
But I don't care, you know,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.  
  
I see the magic  
That we're making now

I love you.  
  
'cause I don't care, you see,  
I just don't care.  
I love you.  
I love you

I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you  
The mist is lifting slowly  
I can see the way ahead  
And I've left behind the empty streets  
That once inspired my life  
And the strength of the emotion  
Is like thunder in the air  
'Cause the promise that we made each other  
Haunts me to the end  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know I'll find you somehow  
Somehow, somehow  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you  
The secret of your beauty and the mystery of your soul  
I've been searching for in everyone I meet  
And the times I've been mistaken, it's impossible to say  
And the grass is growing underneath our feet  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know I'll find you somehow  
Somehow, somehow  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Yes, I know you're out there somewhere  
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah  
Yes, I know it's going to happen  
I can feel you getting near  
And soon we'll be returning  
To the fountain of our youth  
And if you wake up wondering  
In the darkness I'll be there  
My arms will close around you  
And protect you with the truth  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere, somewhere  
I know you're out there somewhere  
Somewhere you can hear my voice  
I know I'll find you somehow  
Somehow, somehow  
I know I'll find you somehow  
And somehow I'll return again to you  

You want me to ride  
In your car outside  
Spend some time with you  
Just an hour or two  
But I really,  
I really haven't  
I really haven't got the time  
I really  
I really haven't  
I really haven't got the time  
I really haven't got the time  
I'm a busy man  
Workin' when I can

I got no time, time to spend  
Oh no, I really

Oh no, I really

Got some time for you (Who's got the time for you)  
But I really

Little guy, little hands, little eyes and lots of time  
What you gonna be what you gonna see  
When your eyes are level with mine  
  
I'll be level with you  
I don't know what I would do  
If I had to face the things that you've got coming down the line  
  
Lots of luck, lots of health, lots of wealth, little pain  
That's what I want for you but there's little I can do  
To put you on the gravy train  
  
I'll be level with you  
You'll always end up coming through  
But you'll find yourself lost in space now and again  
  
But you have to have a world you can live in  
Not a world where all the hope is gone  
And as long as we are here together  
We must build a home for the free  
  
Filled with pity  
Not pain  
That's loving and sane  
Not divided by hate  
And living in spite  
'Til it's too late  
  
Life is here  
Love will come in the end give it time  
There's wonders still to do and I know you'll find it's true  
That yours will be bigger than mine  
  
I'll be level with you  
The one thing I hope you will do is tell me about what  
You're doing from time to time

Oh you know I feel alright,  
Oh yeah.  
You know I feel alright, children.  
Oh yeah.  
  
You know I feel alright,  
Oh yeah.

Shall I go crazy,  
  
'Cause I love you,

Oh I love you too much,  
And if you hurt me

If you ever go and hurt me, baby,  
I'll go crazy.  
'Cause I love you,

Oh I love you too much,  
You've got to live for yourself,  
Yourself, for nobody else.

You know thart I'll go crazy  
'Cause I love you,

Oh I love you much more than I can stand,  
I'm talking about you.

I'm just a wandering on the face of this earth  
Meeting so many people  
Who are trying to be free  
And while I'm traveling I hear so many words  
  
Language barriers broken  
Now we've found the key  
And if you want the wind of change  
To blow about you  
And you're the only other person to know, don't tell me  
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band.  
  
A thousand pictures can be drawn from one word  
Only who is the artist  
We got to agree  
A thousand miles can lead so many ways  
  
Just to know who is driving  
What a help it would be  
So if you want this world of yours  
To turn about you  
And you can see exactly what to do  
Please tell me  
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band.  
  
How can we understand  
Riots by the people for the people  
Who are only destroying themselves  
And when you see a frightened  
Person who is frightened by the  
People who are scorching this earth.  
  
I'm just a wandering on the face of this earth

Meeting so many people bridging the seas  
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band.  
We're just the singers in a rock and roll band.  
I'm just a singer in a rock and roll band...

Here I go again  
Finding it so hard to explain  
The way I feel when I hold you near  
Still it hurts when you cry  
Maybe you think love has passed you by  
Don't you know I need you so  
But I guess you need to know  
  
I'm just a man, that's all I am  
I'm just a man, that's yours  
I'm yours you know I'm yours  
  
Life keeps changing key  
I'll look to you please look back at me  
See I'm changing every day  
Reaching out for happy days  
  
But I'm just a man that's all I am  
I'm just a man I'm yours  
I'm simply yours  
  
Life keeps changing key  
I'll look to you please turn and look at me  
You'll see I'm changing every day  
In my search for happy days  
  
But then I'm just a man  
That's all I am  
I'm just a man I'm yours  
That's yours, simply yours  
  
See me as I am, for I'm just a man  
I'm just a man but I'm yours  
Oh I'm yours I'm simply yours

In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're close to me  
I could see  
That moment of truth when you spoke to me  
In my world  
It's never too late we can both be free  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near  
If you knew  
The changes I feel that you put me through  
And you do  
I see in your eyes that you really do  
And it's true  
It happened so fast that it must be true  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near  
And I'm only just beginning  
To believe what you have done  
How you turned it upside down  
This world of mine  
And it seems while I was looking  
It was right in front of me  
All the time  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're close to me  
I could see  
That moment of truth when you spoke to me  
In my world  
It's never too late we can both be free  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near  
Cause I'm only just beginning  
To believe what you have done  
How you turned it upside down  
This world of mine  
And it seems while I was looking  
It was right in front of me  
All the time  
If you knew  
The changes I feel that you put me through  
And you do  
I see in your eyes that you really do  
And it's true  
It happened so fast that it must be true  
In my world  
It's heaven on earth when you're near

[First Man:] I think, I think I am, therefore I am, I think.  
[Establishment:] Of course you are my bright little star,  
I've miles  
And miles  
Of files  
Pretty files of your forefather's fruit  
And now to suit our  
Great computer,  
You're magnetic ink.  
  
[First Man:] I'm more than that, I know I am, at least, I think I must be.  
[Inner Man:] There you go man, keep as cool as you can.  
Face piles  
And piles  
Of trials  
With smiles.  
It riles them to believe  
That you perceive  
The web they weave  
And keep on thinking free.

In the bleak midwinter  
Frosty wind may blow  
Earth stood hard as iron  
Water like a stone  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow  
Snow on snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long, long ago  
What can I give him?  
Poor as I am  
If I were a shepherd  
I would bring a lamb  
If I were a wise man  
I would do my part  
Yet what I can, I give him  
Give my heart  
Snow had fallen, snow on snow  
Snow on snow on snow  
In the bleak midwinter  
Long, long ago

Walking home with you last night  
You said the world is beautiful  
And how things look that way when you're  
Love  
I love this world  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I opened up the letter that the  
Postman gave to me this morning  
Had to stop myself from shouting out  
"I love this world"  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
I want to be there when  
The age love is come again  
  
Tell me all about yourself  
And how you came to me like in a dream  
And every night I dream of you  
I dream of you  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
When I'm in your arms  
Is this heaven?  
  
I know that heaven waits  
For those whose love is true  
Don't ask me where or when  
The time for us will come again  
  
I sit and watch the sun go down  
And in the darkness there's no sound  
While in the sky tonight the stars all cry "I love  
You"  
Are they crying out over you  
''cause you're in my heart  
Is this heaven?  
''cause the story starts and ends with you

Isn't life strange  
A turn of a page  
Can read like before  
Can we ask for more  
Each day passes by  
How hard man will try  
The sea will not wait  
You know it makes me want to cry, cry, cry  
  
Wish I could be in your heart  
To be one with your love  
Wish I could be in your eyes  
Looking back there your were and here we are  
  
Isn't love strange  
A word we arrange  
With no thought or care  
Maker of despair  
Each breath that we breathe  
With love we must weave  
To make us as one  
You know it makes me want to cry, cry, cry  
  
Wish I could be in your heart  
To be one with your love  
Wish I could be in your eyes  
Looking back there you were, and here we are  
  
Isn't life strange  
A turn of a page  
A book without light  
Unless with love we write  
To throw it away  
To lose just a day  
The quicksand of time  
You know it makes me want to cry cry, cry  
  
Wish I could be in your heart  
To be one with your love  
Wish I could be in your eyes  
Looking back there you were and here we are

Ain't necessarily so.  
Ain't necessarily so.  
Things you're liable  
To read in a bible  
  
Ain't necessarily so.  
Little David he was small, alright,  
Yeah, now David he was small alright,  
Just like Goliath  
  
Lay dying then he dieth,  
Oh he was small, alright.  
Little Moses he was found in a stream.  
Yeah Moses now he was found in a stream  
  
When that Pharaoh's sweet daughter  
She came by and fished that boy out from the water,  
Fished him, she said, from a stream.  
Now Jonah now he lived in a whale.  
  
Yeah Jonah he lived in a whale  
Yet he made his home in that  
Fish's abdomen.  
Jonah he lived in a whale.  
  
I said, ain't necessarily so.  
No, ain't necessarily so.  
The things you're liable  
To read in a bible  
  
Ain't necessarily so.  
Ain't necessarily so.  
No, it ain't necessarily so.

It may be a fire,  
Tomorrow it could be nothing.  
It may reach out to the sky,  
Light up everything that you know.  
Everywhere you go from now  
You will see better than before.  
People you've not known for years  
Will come knocking at your door.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart  
It may be a warm wind  
That tries to blow your heart away.  
It may walk into your life,  
Tell you everything that you know.  
Looking down through all the years,  
Making plans that have gone past,  
Something you've not known for years  
But you knew that it would last.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart  
  
I'm turning all the answers  
Inside out,  
Looking for a love  
That reaches out,  
Or the fire into your heart  
  
It may be a fire,  
Tomorrow it may be nothing.  
It may reach up to the sky,  
Light up everything that I know,  
Everywhere I go from now  
I will see better than before  
  
People I've known for years  
Will come knocking at my door.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it into your heart.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it,  
You gotta get it,  
You gotta get it into your heart.  
It may be a fire  
But you gotta get it  
Into your heart.

I've got a dream  
And, every night, I said to myself  
Yeah, I said I gotta share it  
Share the dream with somebody else  
We could make a beautiful day  
Oh baby, it's a beautiful dream  
But what am I going to do with it, baby?  
Say, what am I going to do with it, baby?  
What am I going to do with it, baby  
Well if I can't share it with you?  
I got some love  
And, baby, it's the kind that will do  
Yeah, I got a kiss  
And give it to someone like you  
The moon is shining up above  
And I got a heart full of love  
But what am I going to do with it, baby?  
Say, what am I going to do with it, baby?  
What am I going to do with it, baby  
But if I can't give it to you?  
I can't throw it in the river  
And I can't toss it in the sea  
And I can't put it in a paper bag  
So, baby, come and get it from me  
I've got a dream  
And, every night, I said to myself  
Yeah, I said I gotta share it  
Share the dream with somebody else  
We could make a beautiful day  
Oh baby, it's a beautiful dream  
But what am I going to do with it, baby?  
Say, what am I going to do with it, baby?  
What am I going to do with it, baby  
But if I can't share it...  
But if I can't share it...  
Well if I can't share it with you?

Breathe deep the gathering gloom,  
Watch lights fade from every room.  
Bedsitter people look back and lament,  
Another day's useless energy spent.  
Impassioned lovers wrestle as one,  
Lonely man cries for love and has none.  
New mother picks up and suckles her son,  
Senior citizens wish they were young.  
Cold hearted orb that rules the night,  
Removes the colours from our sight.  
Red is grey and yellow white,  
But we decide which is right.  
And which is an illusion?

Lazy day, Sunday afternoon,  
Like to get your feet up, watch T.V.  
Sunday roast is something good to eat,  
Must be beef today 'cause lamb was last week.  
  
So full up, bursting at the seams,  
Soon you'll start to nod off, happy dreams.  
Wake up, for tea and buttered scones  
Such a lot of work for you Sunday Moms.  
  
It's such a crying shame  
Week after week the same.  
  
Today's heaven-sent and you're feeling content,  
You worked all week long.  
Still, it's quite sad tomorrow's so bad  
And I don't feel so strong.  
  
Lazy day, Sunday afternoon,  
Like to get your feet up, watch T.V.  
Sunday roast is something good to eat,  
Now it's almost over till week.  
  
That's how your life goes by  
Until the day you die.

Lean on me  
I'll be there  
Whenever you need someone  
To share in every prayer  
In every dream  
You've left somewhere  
'till tomorrow  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Cause tonight  
I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
  
Lean on me  
I'm every where  
Where ever you look i'll be  
Forever yours  
The northern lights  
The southern cross  
I'll give to you  
'till tomorrow  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Cause tonight  
I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
  
If you're lonely  
You know where you can find me  
You know there's no escape when you are on your own  
And if you're worried  
And you can see your world slip through your fingers  
I'll reach out for you in my heart  
There's no more dancing in the dark  
  
You're not alone  
Tomorrow  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Cause tonight  
I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
  
Will be just like it was when we were young  
Tonight I'm gonna take you where  
I've never taken you before  
Will be just like it was when we were young

Along the coast you'll hear them boast  
About a light they say that shines so clear.  
So raise your glass, we'll drink a toast  
To the little man who sells you thrills along the pier.  
  
He'll take you up, he'll bring you down,  
He'll plant your feet back firmly on the ground.  
He flies so high, he swoops so low,  
He knows exactly which way he's gonna go.

Just because it's raining here  
It doesn't mean the sun isn't shining  
Somewhere else for someone  
You have loved  
But who's not near you anymore.  
When your love is on the run  
Don't fall apart at what's begun  
It's just the healing process  
Of your heart.  
  
When your dream has lost its cause  
Don't waste your time in closing doors,  
You'll be the last to know  
When love has gone.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.  
  
Couldn't find the words to say I love you.  
Couldn't fight the hurt of holding on.  
Couldn't hope.  
Couldn't dream.  
Couldn't see tomorrow.  
Without your love  
I can't go on.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.  
  
When your love is on the run  
Don't fall apart at what's begun.  
It's just the healing process  
Of your heart.  
  
When your dream has lost it's cause  
Don't waste your time in closing doors,  
You'll be the last to know  
When love has gone.  
  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run.  
Love is on the run from me.

Wonderful day, for passing my way  
Knock on my door and even the score with your eyes....  
  
Lovely to see you again my friend  
Walk along with me to the next bend  
  
Dark cloud of fear is blowing away  
Now that you're here, you're going to stay, 'cause it's  
  
Lovely to see you again my friend  
Walk along with me to the next bend  
  
Tell us what you've seen  
In far away forgotten lands  
Where empires have turned back to sand  
  
Wonderful day for passing my way  
Knock on my door, and even the score with your eyes..  
  
Lovely to see you again my friend  
Walk along with me to the next bend...

On Lover's Island  
Where the trees stand so tall  
And the dust turn to gold  
And love never grows old  
  
On Lover's Island  
Where the birds sing of love  
Seems a gift from up above  
I met her one day  
(Met her one day)  
  
As we stood alone on the mountain  
Under the moon and stars above  
Oh, darling, don't ever go  
She was Venus, the goddess of love  
  
On Lover's Island  
Where the trees stand so tall  
And the dust turn to gold  
And love never, never  
Never, never grows old

When I look in your eyes  
I can't see why  
There's no reflection of me  
When I look in your heart  
Let it be the start  
Work your magic on me  
  
When I look in your eye  
I can't see why  
It's all a mystery to me  
When I ask you to look inside and tell me why  
Nothing can change what will be  
  
Baby work your magic on me  
Baby work your magic on me  
I'm in a state of permanent confusion  
Without your love  
Without your love  
Baby work your magic on me  
  
When I look in your mind  
Is there a reason why  
It's all an illusion to me  
I was lost in the game  
That only two can play  
When you work your magic on me  
  
Baby work your magic on me  
Baby work your magic on me  
I'm in a state of permanent confusion  
Without your love  
Without your love  
Baby work your magic on me  
  
What kind of love is this you're talking about  
It's got no reason got no easy way out  
What kind of love as got a hold of me  
What kind of love  
What kind of love  
What kind of love  
Baby work your magic on me  
  
When I look in your eye  
I can see why  
There's no reflection of me  
I should have known from the start  
That you would steal my heart  
If you work all your magic on me  
  
Baby work your magic on me  
Baby work your magic on me  
I'm in a state of permanent confusion  
Without your love  
Without your love  
I know I want to be with you tonight  
Baby work your magic on me

Maybe  
Maybe I'm wrong  
To go on thinking, to sing my song  
Maybe  
This world's falling down  
Call up the trumpeters and knock the walls down  
  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
  
Slowly  
Slowly we walk  
No harm in crying, no sense in talk  
Slowly  
The ice melts away  
Call on the choir to sing  
And turn no-one away  
  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
  
Maybe  
Maybe I'm wrong  
The river holds it's breath  
The sea will keep it's calm  
Slowly  
Slowly we turn  
A look at where we've been  
The juggler has to learn  
  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you  
Someone who needs  
Someone who feels  
Someone who sees can find you

Never dreamt I would hope  
While I count the miles  
Through the wind and the rain  
I can see your smile  
There ain't no turning back  
I can see it in the distance  
Got it in my sight  
  
Like a vision like a face  
Coming out of the sky  
You were there not a dream  
You were there in my eyes  
There ain't no turning back  
I can see it in the distance  
Touch it through the night  
Driving into the light  
When I'm on my own  
When I'm all alone  
  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Is it a dream?  
Is it a dream coming true?  
Meet me halfway  
  
Like a vision like a face  
Coming out of the sky  
You were there not a dream  
You were there in my eyes  
There are no words to say  
I can see you in the distance  
Hear you through the night  
Ain't no easy way  
When you're on your own  
When you're all alone  
  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Won't you meet me halfway  
Is it a dream?  
Is it a dream coming true?  
Meet me halfway

I'm a melancholy man, that's what I am,  
All the world surrounds me, and my feet are on the ground.  
I'm a very lonely man, doing what I can,  
All the world astounds me and I think I understand  
That we're going to keep growing, wait and see.  
  
When all the stars are falling down  
Into the sea and on the ground,  
And angry voices carry on the wind,  
A beam of light will fill your head  
And you'll remember what's been said  
By all the good men this world's ever known.  
Another man is what you'll see,  
Who looks like you and looks like me,  
And yet somehow he will not feel the same,  
His life caught up in misery, he doesn't think like you and me,  
'Cause he can't see what you and I can see.

Words a simple song  
A minstrel sings  
A way of life in his eyes  
Hear the morning call of waking birds  
When they are singing, bringing  
Love - love.  
Everywhere love is all around,  
Everywhere love is all around.  
  
Now the winter's gone  
Cold wind has blown  
The endless stream in our lives  
Where the minstrel sings  
This simple song  
He's always bringing, singing,  
Love - love.  
Everywhere love is all around,  
Everywhere love is all around.  
  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love.  
Follow our friend,  
Our wandering friend,  
Listen to the one,  
Who sings of love.  
Everywhere love is around,  
Around, around.  
  
Here the nations sing  
Our minstrel's song,  
As he walks by in their lives  
Soon the spring will come,  
And everyone will all be singing, bringing  
Love - love  
Everywhere love is all around,  
Everywhere love is all around.  
  
Listen to the one  
Who sings of love.  
Follow our friend,  
Our wandering friend,  
Listen to the one,  
Who sings of love.  
Everywhere love is around,  
Around, around.

I closed the door and I walked away  
From the life I knew  
On a night in June.  
I took a chance and I lost control  
Trying to find out why  
On a night in July.  
Why this hesitation?  
I can feel that the night is slipping away.  
want to drown in the ocean of your love,  
want to dance in the moonlight  
Looking for a miracle  
I left the city on a wave of despair  
To stand on my own  
On an August night.  
From the valley of broken hearts  
Gonna make a new start in September.  
Why this confusion?  
I can feel that the night is slipping away.  
want to walk from the shadows to the sun  
Just to dream on a summer night,  
Dream about a miracle  
Looking for a miracle.  
  
Never had the chance before  
To turn the tide my way.  
In the heat of the summer night  
You took my breath away  
Looking for a miracle.  
  
want to walk from the shadows to the sun  
Just to dream on a summer night,  
Dream about a miracle.  
Your love is just a miracle.  
  
I closed the door and I walked away

I can feel that the night is slipping away.

My brother  
If you could cast a little light on someone  
It's not too soon  
You took me halfway round the world  
I'm running out of time and reasons  
My true friend  
If you could tell me what it is that keeps you  
From coming down  
You left me way up in the clouds  
The higher you fly the less I see you  
So far  
Cross a wild and windy sea  
So far  
That our voices are  
Divided by an ocean, an ocean  
My brother  
If you could take a little time to slow down  
It's more your style  
It takes a lifetime to decide  
I'm running out of time and reasons  
I'm running out, I'm running out  
So far  
Cross a wild and windy sea  
So far  
That our voices are  
Divided by an ocean, an ocean  

Fairy tales sometimes come true  
Use fairy dust and pixie glue  
Then all the love will stick to you  
My little lovely.  
  
Always believe and never doubt  
That wizards cast their spells about  
There's such a lot you won't lose count  
If you look closely.  
  
Ripples are like dreams  
Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
So choose one wisely.  
  
Not all angels can grow wings  
They seem to soar by other means  
You can fly although it seems  
A little slowly.  
  
Fairy tales sometimes come true  
Use fairy dust and pixie glue  
Then all the love will stick to you  
My little lovely.  
  
Ripples are like dreams  
Searching for the shore  
Poured together make oceans roar  
Night visions make spirits soar  
My little lovely.

I'm going to sing my song  
And sing it all day long  
A song that never ends  
How can I tell you, all the things inside my head.  
  
The change in these past years  
Has made me see our world  
In many different ways  
How can I tell you, love can change our destiny.  
  
Love can change the world  
Love can change your life  
Do what makes you happy  
Do what you know is right  
And love with all your might  
Before it's too late  
  
Where did I find all these words  
Something inside of me is burning  
There's life in other worlds  
Maybe they'll come to earth  
Helping man to find a way  
  
One day I hope we'll be in perfect harmony  
A planet with one mind  
Then I could tell you  
All the things inside my head  
  
I'm going to sing my song  
And sing it all day long  
A song that never ends  
How can I tell you, all the things inside my head.  
  
I'm going to sing my song  
A song that never ends

Just in a simple conversation  
You can hear the feeling change  
Down to the sea  
And if you need an explanation  
I defy you to explain  
Why I am so nervous  
Please explain to me  
Why I can't sleep  
I close my eyes to shelter  
In the dark I try to hide  
If you leave me on my own  
I'm worried I could lose my way  
In my mind confusion  
I see you everywhere  
But we don't speak  
I try so hard to touch you  
But you're always out of reach  
If you walked right by  
Would I see in it your eye  
Would you turn away  
Seems to me  
I've been a long time  
On this road  
Has there been a sign  
Another way  
And I've passed it by  
I don't know what it is that drives me on  
Gotta keep movin'  
Gotta keep movin' on  
Bring it on home  
Let's bring it on home - your love  
Bring it on home  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Down parallel lines  
Don't question faith  
Don't answer lies  
Tell me why I'm nervous  
Please explain to me  
Why I can't sleep  
Please explain to me  
Why you're always out of reach  
If the water ran dry  
Would I see it in your eye  
Would you walk away  
It seems to me I've been a long time on this road  
And I wonder why  
Has there been a sign that points another way  
And I've passed it by  
I don't know what it is that drives me on  
Gotta keep movin'  
Gotta keep movin' on  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Down parallel lines  
Don't question faith  
Don't answer lies  
You know you gotta keep movin'  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love  
Bring it on home  
(straight lines before my eyes)  
Let's bring it on home your love

Sailing along  
The river of time  
Adrift on dreams  
Through midnight chimes  
Positively frozen  
Crystal Waterfalls  
The mountain of hope  
Is there to be climbed  
The sea of serenity  
Is rightfully mine  
Step on to the water  
Knowing what is true  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain  
The last whispered wish of age  
Is to live it all again  
So never blame the rainbows for the rain  
  
The beat of my heart  
The rhythm of love  
The earth that's beneath us  
The heavens above  
I can hear forever  
Calling out to me  
The changes we go though  
Are making me strong  
The shelter of friendship  
Is where we belong  
Look into the future  
Knowing what we see  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain  
The last whispered wish of age  
Is to live it all again  
So never blame the rainbows for the rain  
  
The whirlpool of doubt  
Can spin you around  
The wave of emotion  
Takes you up  
Pulls you down  
Leaving far behind us  
Sweet young passions spray  
  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain  
And learn to forget the memories  
That cause you pain  
The last whispered wish of age  
Is to live it all again  
So never blame the rainbows  
Never blame the rainbows  
Never blame the rainbows for the rain

Well I've had dreams enough for one  
And I've got love enough for three  
I have my hopes to comfort me  
I got my new horizons out to sea  
But I'm never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
'cause I know I'm gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday  
Where is this place that we have found?  
Nobody knows where we are bound  
I long to hear, I need to see  
'cause I've shed tears too many for me, me  
But I'm never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
'cause I know I'm gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday  
On the wind soaring free  
Spread your wings, I'm beginning to see  
Out of mind far from view  
Beyond the reach of a nightmare come true  
Well I've had dreams enough for one  
And I got love enough for three  
I have my hopes to comfort me  
I got my new horizons out to sea  
But I'm never gonna lose your precious gift  
It will always be that way  
'cause I know I'm gonna find my own peace of mind  
Someday, someway  

Nice to be here hope you agree  
Lying in the sun  
Lovely weather, must climb a tree  
The show has just begun  
  
All the leaves start swaying  
To the breeze that's playing  
On a thousand violins  
And the bees are humming  
To a frog sat strumming  
On a guitar with only one string  
  
I can see them they can't see me  
I feel out of sight  
I can see them they can't see me  
Much to my delight  
  
And it seems worth noting  
Water rats were boating  
As a lark began to sing  
The sounds kept coming  
With Jack Rabbit loudly drumming  
On the side of a biscuit tin  
  
I can see them they can't see me  
I feel out of sight  
I can see them they can't see me  
Much to my delight  
  
Silver minnows were devising  
Water ballet so surprising  
A mouse played a daffodil  
A mole came up blinking  
Underneath an owl who's thinking  
How he came to be sat on a hill  
  
I can see them they can't see me  
I feel out of sight  
I can see them they can't see me  
Much to my delight  
  
I know you won't believe me  
But I'm certain that I did see  
A mouse playing daffodil  
All the band was really jumping  
With Jack Rabbit in there thumping  
I found that I couldn't sit still  
I just had to make it with them  
Cause they played my kind of rhythm  
And the bees hummed in harmony  
And the owl played his oboe  
Then the frog's guitar solo  
It was all just too much for me  
  
I know you won't believe me  
But I'm certain that I did see  
A mouse playing daffodil  
All the band was really jumping  
With Jack Rabbit in there thumping  
I found that I couldn't sit still

Nights in white satin  
Never reaching the end  
Letters I've written  
Never meaning to send  
Beauty I've always missed  
With these eyes before  
Just what the truth is  
I can't say any more  
'Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
  
Gazing at people some hand in hand  
Just what I'm going through they can't understand  
Some try to tell me thoughts they cannot defend  
Just what you want to be you will be in the end  
  
And I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you  
  
Nights in white satin  
Never reaching the end  
Letters I've written  
Never meaning to send  
Beauty I've always missed  
With these eyes before  
Just what the truth is  
I can't say any more  
  
'Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you  
'Cause I love you  
Yes I love you  
Oh how I love you  
Oh how I love you

I need you like you need me:  
Truly and completely,  
Never be apart.  
I think that you should tell me,  
Come right out and tell me,  
Just what's in your heart.  
And, if you think that it's alright,  
Let's make a deal and work it out.  
We'll walk into the sunset, you and I,  
With no more alibis  
When we tell each other:  
No more lies.  
  
Well, truth is my addiction,  
Stranger still than fiction,  
Wider than the sky,  
And songs that have such feeling.  
Words that have such meaning,  
Dreams that never die.  
  
And, if you think that it's alright,  
Let's turn around and start again.  
We'll walk beside the ocean, hand in hand,  
With no more alibis  
When we tell each other:  
No more lies  
  
I sometimes think that, maybe,  
You're just a little girl.  
You know I love you, baby,  
I've got to tell the world  
  
So that's the final story,  
The truth in all it's glory.  
See how much I care.  
You know you drive me crazy,  
Thrill me and amaze me,  
Drive me to despair  
  
And, if you think that now feels right,  
Let's close the door and dim the light.  
We'll greet the dawn together, side by side.  
Just look into my eyes  
'Cause you know I'll tell you:  
No more lies

I saw your picture in the paper  
I didn't know your name  
But the pain was there for all to see  
As the snow turned to rain  
I saw your picture didn't know what to do  
A lonely face in the crowd  
In that moment when the world stood still  
And tears lay on the ground  
Wherever I go, I will think of you  
Whatever I do, whatever I say on this Christmas Day  
A silent a prayer on the street  
Is it Heaven that has the final word?  
With the world at your feet  
Wherever I go, I will think of you  
Whatever I do, whatever I say on this Christmas Day  
On this Christmas day  
Wherever I go, I will think of you  
Whatever I do, whatever I say on this Christmas Day  
Wherever I go, I will think of you, I will be with you  
On this Christmas Day  
On this Christmas Day  

Look out of my window  
See the world passing by  
See the look in her eye  
  
One more time to live and I have made it mine  
Leave the wise to write for they write worldly rhymes  
  
And he who wants to fight begins the end of time...  
For I have riches more than these  
For I have riches more than these  
  
Desolation  
Creation  
Tell me someone why there's only confusion  
Evolution  
  
Tell me someone that this is all an illusion  
Pollution  
Tell me someone  
Saturation  
  
Tell me someone  
Population  
Annihilation  
Revolution  
  
Tell me someone why this talk of revolution  
Confusion  
Tell me someone when we're changing evolution  
Illusion  
  
Tell me someone  
Conclusion  
Tell me someone  
Starvation  
  
Degredation  
Humiliation  
Contemplation  
Changes in my life  
  
Inspiration  
Elation  
Changes in my life  
Salvation  
  
Changes in my life  
Communication  
Compassion  
Solution  
  
Look out on the hedgerow  
As the world rushes by  
Hear the birds sign a sigh  
  
One more tree will fall how strong the growing vine  
Turn the earth to sand and still permit no crime  
How one thought will live provide the others die  
For I have riches more than these  
For I have riches more than these

One step into the light  
One step away from night  
It's the hardest step you're gonna take  
The ship to take you there  
Is waiting at the head  
Of the stairs that lead up through your opening mind  
  
Above the dark despair  
Shines a light that we can share  
Close your eyes and look up in between your brows  
Then slowly breathing in  
Feel the life force streaming in  
Hold it there, then send it back to him  
  
All the old things are returning  
Cosmic circles ever turning  
All the truth we've been yearning for  
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul  
  
The river of living breath  
Is flowing through the sun  
He was there before the earth began  
The world will drag on you  
Use his love to pull you through  
Find the mission of your life and start to be  
  
All the old things are returning  
Cosmic circles ever turning  
All the truth we've been yearning for  
Life is our saviour, saviour, saviour, save your soul  
  
There's one thing I can do  
Play my mellotron for you  
Try to blow away your city blues  
Your dreams are not unfound  
Get your feet back on the ground  
The truth will set us free, we cannot lose  
We cannot love, we just have to choose

Gazing past the planets  
Looking for total view  
I've been laying here for hours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
  
Wonders of a lifetime  
Right there before your eyes  
Searching with this life of ours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
Out and in, out and in  
  
Will you think it's a joke  
That's all right  
Do what you want to do  
I've said my peace  
And I'll leave it all up to you  
  
Wonders of a lifetime  
Right there before your eyes  
Searching with this life of ours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
Out and in, out and in  
  
Will you think it's a joke  
That's all right  
Do what you want to do  
I've said my peace  
And I'll leave it all up to you  
  
Gazing past the planets  
Looking for total view  
I've been laying here for hours  
You gotta make the journey out and in  
Out and in, out and in  
Out and in, out and in

I can sing  
I can dance  
Just give me a chance  
To do my turn for you  
There's a change I'll slip  
But with stiff upper lip  
I'll sing a song for you  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard to be a jester  
All the time  
And no one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside  
I've shed a tear for the lying  
While everyday trying to  
Paint this smile for you  
Backflips, cartwheelings,  
Somersault feelings  
What is there left to do  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard for me,  
A jester all the time  
No one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside  
Roll up, roll up  
Enjoy the show  
Pick me up, wind me up, put me down  
You'll see me go  
And this painted smile  
May miss for a while  
Then come back and steal your show  
I sing, I dance  
Give me a change to do my turn for you  
With backflips, cartwheelings,  
Somersault feelings  
What's there left to do  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard to be a jester  
All the time  
No one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside  
Laughter is free  
But it's so hard to be a jester  
All the time  
No one's believing  
I'm the same when I'm bleeding  
And I hurt all the time deep inside

Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door  
With a thousand million questions  
About hate and death and war?  
'Cause when we stop and look around us  
There is nothing that we need  
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed  
  
Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door  
Because the truth is hard to swallow  
That's what the war of love is for  
  
It's not the way that you say it  
When you do those things to me  
It's more the way that you mean it  
When you tell me what will be  
And when you stop and think about it  
You won't believe it's true  
That all the love you've been giving  
Has all been meant for you  
  
I'm looking for someone to change my life  
I'm looking for a miracle in my life  
And if you could see what it's done to me  
To lose the love I knew  
Could safely lead me through  
  
Between the silence of the mountains  
And the crashing of the sea  
There lies a land I once lived in  
And she's waiting there for me  
But in the Grey of the morning  
My mind becomes confused  
Between the dead and the sleeping  
And the road that I must choose  
  
I'm looking for someone to change my life  
I'm looking for a miracle in my life  
And if you could see what it's done to me  
To lose the love I knew  
Could safely lead me to  
The land that I once knew  
To learn as we grow old  
The secrets of our soul  
It's not the way that you say it when you do those things to me  
It's more the way you really mean it when you tell me what will be  
  
Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door  
With a thousand million questions  
About hate and death and war  
'Cause when we stop and look around us  
There is nothing that we need  
In a world of persecution that is burning in its greed  
  
Why do we never get an answer  
When we're knocking at the door

Ride, ride my see-saw,  
Take this place  
On this trip  
Just for me.  
  
Ride, take a free ride,  
Take my place  
Have my seat  
It's for free.  
  
I worked like a slave for years,  
Sweat so hard just to end my fears.  
Not to end my life a poor man,  
But by now, I know I should have run.  
  
Run, run my last race,  
Take my place  
Have this number  
Of mine.  
  
Run, run like a fire,  
Don't you run in  
In the lanes  
Run for time.  
  
Left school with a first class pass,  
Started work but as second class.  
School taught one and one is two.  
But right now, that answer just ain't true.  
  
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah  
Ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah, ah ah ah ah ah  
  
My world is spinning around,  
Everything is lost that I found.  
People run, come ride with me,  
Let's find another place that's free.  
  
Ride, ride my see-saw,  
Take this place  
On this trip  
Just for me.  
  
Ride, take a free ride,  
Take my place  
Have my seat  
It's for free.  
  
Ride, my see-saw.  
Ride, ride, ride, my see-saw.  
Ride, my see-saw...

I'm looking for a better world  
Where there's no more hurt,  
Where there's only hope  
For the eagle and the dove.  
I can see your face,  
Nothing can take your place  
If we sail away on a river of endless love.  
I'm living in the hands of time,  
On the wings of love,  
On the edge of night,  
Where there's darkness everywhere.  
I won't be denied,  
I'm never going to leave your side,  
I will always be  
On the river of endless love  
  
In the silence just before the dawn  
The shadows lose their form.  
We rise to greet the morning.  
In the calm that comes before the storm  
A troubled and a restless heart is born.  
The river of endless love  
  
I'm tearing down the walls of hate,  
Gonna start again, gonna turn it round,  
Gonna build it with a prayer.  
I can always dream  
And nothing is what it seems.  
If you lose your way  
You can always find us there.  
  
In the silence just before the dawn  
The shadows lose their form  
We rise to greet the morning  
In the calm that comes before the storm  
A troubled and a restless heart is born  
The river of endless love

Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Not gonna lose my nerve,  
Not gonna fall apart,  
Not gonna turn the tide,  
Not gonna start from the top,  
Not gonna lose control,  
Not gonna turn around,  
Not gonna break my step,  
Not gonna till I take you to the top  
'cause there's something baby  
That I want you to know:  
What price love  
If there's nothing to show?  
  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
  
No need to close the door,  
No need to lose your way,  
No need to stand alone.  
Just try to understand what I'm saying  
'cause I'm gonna hold on,  
Not gonna turn you loose,  
Not gonna bring you down,  
Not gonna let you go,  
I only want to take you to the top  
'cause, if I don't have you,  
Then I want you to know:  
What price love  
If we've nothing to show?  
  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.  
Like a rock I'm gonna roll over you.

Some days you're gonna put me on hold,  
Some days you're gonna put me  
On a pedestal up high.  
I don't know if it's me,  
I don't know if it's you,  
I don't know if it's both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
And when it comes to taking my calls  
There's something more between us  
Than a telephone line.  
I can't believe it's me,  
I can't believe it's you,  
I can't believe it's both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love  
  
Can't think of how we lost our way.  
Some days I feel  
I'm getting very close to you.  
Can't think of how the story ends,  
Can't hear the words  
I really want to hear from you.  
We're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love  
  
Some people like to put you on hold,  
Some people like to put you  
On a pedestal up high.  
I don't know if it's me,  
I don't know if it's you,  
I don't know if it's both of us  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
Not knowing what to do  
When we're running out of love.  
  
Can't believe we're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love.  
Can't believe we're running out of love.

Time hurries on, look and it's gone  
The changing of the autumn tide  
The hopes that live, the dreams that die  
If I could have you by my side, I'd give it all away  
You, you and I, we must hold on, we must try  
To reach beyond that far off cloud  
Along the road we're travellin' now  
If I could only show you how, I need you there with me  
Oh, running water, don't care what people say  
We live to love another day  
Oh, running water, don't throw your love away  
We live to love another day  
Time hurries on, turn around and it's gone  
If only we could hold that dream  
If only life was what it seemed  
I know my darling what you mean, I've seen it slip away  
Oh, running water, don't care what people say  
We live to love another day  
Oh, running water, don't throw your love away  
We live to love another day  

I've been thinkin' the way people do  
'Bout the things that matter  
To me and you  
I've decided to do what I can  
And to find the kind of man  
I really am  
I can see the world from here  
And it sometimes makes me  
Want to disappear  
Back to nature that's where we belong  
And with just one truth I've found  
You can't go wrong  
Wherever you go, whatever you do  
Whatever you say, say, say, say  
Say it with love  
I remember, a long time ago  
When I heard those guitars  
That I worship so  
I was captured, I wanted to stay  
And to hear that kind of music  
Everyday  
Heard the songs around the world  
Saw the smiling faces  
On the boys and girls  
I was destined to play come what may  
And there's just one thing  
I knew I had to say  
Wherever you go, whatever you do  
Whatever you say, say, say, say  
Say it with love  
Underneath, a sea of doubt  
There's a million voices shouting  
Let me out  
(Let me out)  
When we go, we never return  
'cause there's just one lesson  
That we got to learn  
Wherever you go, whatever you do  
Whatever you say, say, say, say  
Say it with love  
Say it with love, say it with love  
Say it with love, say it with love  

Say what you mean  
Mean what you say  
Say what you mean  
Mean what you say  
Think about the words  
That you're using  
Speak for yourself  
Say what's on your mind  
Think about the life  
That you're choosing  
Whenever you need somebody  
Whenever you're looking  
For somebody who knows  
When trouble won't leave you alone.  
  
Say what you mean  
Mean what you say  
Look into the world of tomorrow  
Say what you want  
Want what is true  
Check out of the room  
Full of sorrow  
I'm ready to take you with me  
I'm ready to be the one  
Who's there by your side  
When you've just got  
Nowhere to hide.  
  
And oh,  
The angels will walk with you  
Whenever you need them  
Yeah, the glory that comes with love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
And oh,  
The treasure that waits for us  
Whenever we need it  
Now, I just can't hold it back  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
  
The work and the pain  
The thunder and the rain  
The word of the earth has been spoken  
The bird on the wing  
Free as the wind  
Knowing that the spell  
Has been broken  
Now you can laugh with meaning  
Now you can throw away  
The cloak of disguise  
As you turn your face  
To the sky  
  
The blue of the night  
The secrets of the light  
The touch of the hand  
That can lead you  
I known you recognize  
The shiver of surprise  
Then you realize  
That he's seen you  
Into the strange unknown of love  
Standing before me  
How your nakedness shows  
Now I just can't leave you alone  
  
Ah oh,  
I'm ready to take you now  
Whenever you want to go  
Yeah, my heart is there for you  
Yeah, yeah, yeah  
And oh,  
The glory that comes with love  
For always and ever, now  
Now you can feel me love  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
Tell me about the love that you're feeling  
Say what you mean what you say

Say what you mean, mean what you say  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
  
Let's walk into the forest  
Only witnessed by the moon  
And the breeze that once would chill us  
Now excites  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
And we'll touch the secret places  
As the earth beneath us breathes  
And the raw exquisite ecstasy  
Rushes in  
  
Say what you mean, mean what you say  
Yeah, yeah, yeah. Yeah, yeah, yeah.

I can hear the music playing  
I can hear the word that you're saying  
I can see the love life in your eyes  
What's the use in looking for an answer  
I might find out  
It could be a disaster  
Hold on to your own time  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry  
  
I can see your face on a piece of tomorrow  
I'll hang my dream on a road I can follow  
I gotta touch the warmth of your love  
(Need the warmth of your love, not gonna)  
Not gonna take a chance a  
Change of direction  
Gonna keep on rolling till I find the connection  
Hold on to your lifeline  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry  
I'm sitting at  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
  
Like a voyeur standing at the edge of time  
Looking for a reason  
That's got no rhyme  
Love took a corner  
Shot off for a mile  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Rock on...Rocker  
  
I can feel the music playing (Hold on)  
I can hear the word that you're saying (Hold on)  
I can see the love life in your eyes  
Ain't no use in looking for an answer (Hold on)  
I might find out  
That it could be a disaster (Hold on)  
Hold on to your own time  
Don't let go  
Don't let go  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry  
I'm sitting at  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, roll on by, by, by  
Sitting at the wheel  
Don't let the river run dry (Oh)  
  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll, rock and roll on by  
Sitting at the wheel (sitting, sitting, sitting)  
I'm just sitting  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
I'm sitting at the wheel  
Watching the river roll by  
Rock and roll by  
Sitting at the wheel  
  
I'm just sitting  
Sitting at the wheel  
  
If you're sitting at the wheel  
Watch this rocker roll by

Slings and arrows, slings and arrows,  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows.  
No chance for a second chance  
When the arrows start to fly.  
No way is an easy way  
To say goodbye.

If you never cease to try.  
Never thought you would walk away  
From my side.  
I just can't hide from  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows,  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows.  
  
Life is ever changing,  
Nothing stays the same,  
Nothing in this whole wide world  
Can turn us back again  
'cause where we're standing now  
Is the point of no return,  
Looking back on a world that's got to learn  
You just can't hide from  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows,  
Slings and arrows, slings and arrows.  
  
  
Love is the shield  
When you're standing  
With your back to the wall  
And if you turn around  
And walk away  
You're never gonna lose  
'cause love conquers all.  
  
No chance for a second chance  
When the arrows start to fly.

Just look at me know  
Because I'm tired of yelling  
Look at me now  
It's only me I'm selling  
I'm not willing to trade  
My life to make the sale  
You turn me around  
You put me down  
Look at me now  
  
I'm hanging out my heart to dry  
For the last time  
I'll tell you the reason why  
It's for the last time  
  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - lie  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
Sorry a word they only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means forgive my yesterdays  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - lie  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
And sorry that's a word they can only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means forgive my yesterdays  
(Sorry)  
  
Here I am loving you  
You lay you lay so quietly  
I can feel your breath upon my skin  
Afterglow came suddenly  
With you it always did  
  
I'm hanging out my heart to dry  
For the last time  
I'll tell you the reason why  
It's for the last time  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - lie  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
  
They say sorry that's a word  
They only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means  
Forgive my yesterdays  
  
(Uptown people lie)  
Laid back uptown turnaround people - wear disguises  
They say sorry  
That's a word they only use too late  
Sorry is a word that only ever means forgive

I took a ride in a limousine,  
I took a road I'd never been.  
I met a stranger by the way,  
His coat was torn but his eyes were clear.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
Steppin' in a slide zone.  
  
He told me where a river flows,  
He showed me how the apple grows.  
He told me of a magic stream,  
His face was worn but his eyes were clear.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' in a slide zone.  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' through a time zone.  
  
He went to find a shooting star,  
Around the bend, that's where they are.  
I went along just for the ride,  
Suddenly I began to slide.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' through a time zone.  
  
The air raced by there was no sound,  
We drifted high above the ground.  
And then he said you know this place,  
And then a smile lit up his face.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' in a slide zone.  
Standing in a slide zone,  
I could be steppin' through a time zone.  
  
I turned my head and I looked below, Slide zone...  
And there was something there I know.  
Suddenly I began to fall,  
I looked around and tried to call.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
He had me steppin' in a time zone.  
Standing in a slide zone,  
Falling through a time zone.  
  
Help me please, I thought I said,  
Then something happened in my head.  
Music came from all around,  
And I knew what I had found.  
  
Standing in a slide zone,  
Falling through a time zone.  
Steppin' in a slide zone,  
He had me falling through a time zone.  
Slide zone, slide zone,  
Slide zone, time zone.

So you talked to my girl  
When I don't want you to  
Want you to  
Just the thought of you holding her  
When I don't want you to  
Want you to  
Won't do  
No, no, no  
It won't do, no  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
So you talk better than me  
And you know, you know it, know you know it  
And if you want to get her from me  
And you know you know it, know you know it  
Won't do, no  
I'm telling you it won't do, no  
  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us  
  
Oh please, forget about it  
Make your mind up  
What you're going to do about us  
  
Stop! Stop!  
You're trying to break it up between us  
Stop! Stop!  
Don't want a broken heart between us...

Long time ago  
Back in the mist of time  
Back when the crystal waters flowed  
There was a world  
So strange and so beautiful  
All life would flourish and would grow  
Years went by, time just fell away  
Love was worshiped like the sun  
But as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
What do we need?  
What do we hunger for?  
Who holds the secrets, who will know?  
Temples of greed  
In ruins on the river bed  
Wastelands that lived before the snow  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun  
And as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times  
Strange times  
It's you and I forever  
We won't be afraid  
Even if the stars are falling down  
Down, down, down, down  
Falling down  
Time stands still  
As we race through the universe  
On our way to the sun  
And as we arrive at the house  
Of the water sign  
We're living in strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  
Strange times, strange times  

Shadows of night falling over my head  
People walking  
Passing me by  
Shadows of dreams falling out of the blue  
People talking  
What can I do  
Where do I go from here  
Where do I go from here  
I could give you any dream and watch it grow  
I could take you for a ride but you would know  
I could tell you every answer that I know  
It wouldn't be much tho'  
It wouldn't be anything you didn't know  
  
But  
Survival  
Nothing more than survival  
  
Shadows of days hanging endless in time  
Slowly fading  
Passing us by  
Shadows of worlds disappearing from view  
People asking  
What could we do?  
Where do I go from here  
Where do I go from here  
  
If I gave you every dream they would grow  
If I took you for a ride would you know  
If I told you every answer that I know  
It wouldn't be much tho'  
It wouldn't be anything you didn't know  
  
But survival  
In you love, I have all that  
I need for  
survival  
With your love I have all that  
I need for  
Survival  
With our love we have all that  
We need for  
Survival

Talking, talking.  
It doesn't really matter  
If you know my name.  
It doesn't really matter  
If you see things the same  
As I do.  
It doesn't even matter  
If I'm tired and tense.  
It doesn't even matter  
If I'm still making sense  
Over you.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking,  
'cause I'm only talking, talking,  
Talking, talking  
It doesn't matter  
What the people  
All around you say.  
Be careful how  
You listen,  
They don't know you  
The way that I do  
And, if you want to  
Talk about it baby,  
That's alright,  
It's better if I say it  
Than to sit down  
And write it to you.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking,  
'cause I'm only talking, talking.  
  
It can be that  
You're here with me  
When I'm standing out  
On my own,  
The words of love  
That you gave  
When we were alone.  
It doesn't matter  
If you want to  
Rock and roll all night,  
I know you're gonna  
Be there when the  
Feeling is right,  
The feeling is right,  
The feeling is right.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking.  
I'm just talking, talking,  
Talking, talking.  
You know I'm just  
Talking, talking,  
Talking, talking.

[repeat to fadeout]  
  
  

The curtain rises on the scene,  
With someone chanting to be free.  
The play unfolds before my eyes,  
Descends the actor who is me.  
The sleeping hours take us far,  
From traffic, telephones, and fear.  
Put out your problems with a cat,  
Escape until a bell you hear.  
Our reasons are the same,  
But there's no one we can blame,  
For there's no where we need go,  
And the only truth we know, comes so easily.  
The sound I have heard in your hello,  
Oh darling, you're almost part of me.Oh darling, you're all I'll ever see.  
It's such a rainy afternoon,  
No point in going anywhere.  
The sounds just drift across my room,  
I wish this feeling I could share.  
It's such a rainy afternoon,  
She sits and gazes from her window.  
Her mind tries to recall his face,  
A feeling deep inside her grows.

After he had journeyed,  
And his feet were sore,  
And he was tired,  
He came upon an orange grove  
And he rested.  
  
And he lay in the cool,  
And while he rested,  
He took to himself an orange  
And tasted it,  
And it was good.  
  
And he felt the earth to his spine,  
And he asked,  
And he saw the tree above him,  
And the stars,  
And the veins in the leaf,  
And the light,  
And the balance.  
  
And he saw magnificent perfection,  
Whereon he thought of himself in balance,  
And he knew he was.  
  
Just open your eyes, and realize,  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your heart and that's a start  
  
And he thought of those he angered,  
For he was not a violent man,  
And he thought of those he hurt  
For he was not a cruel man  
And he thought of those he frightened  
For he was not a evil man,  
  
And he understood.  
He understood himself.  
Upon this  
He saw that when he was of anger  
Or knew hurt  
Or felt fear,  
It was because he was not understanding.  
And he learned, compassion.  
  
And with his eye of compassion  
He saw his enemies  
Like unto himself,  
And he learned love.  
Then, he was answered.  
  
Just open your eyes, and realize,  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your heart and that's a start  
  
Just open your eyes, and realize,  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your mind and you will find  
The way it's always been.  
Just open your heart and that's a start

And you can fly  
High as a kite if you want to  
Faster than light if you want to  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel  
  
It's all a dream  
Light passing by on the screen  
And there's you and I on the beam  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel  
  
We ride the waves  
Distance is gone, will we find out?  
How life bean, will be find out?  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel  
  
And you can fly  
High as a kite if you want to  
Faster than light if you want to  
Speeding through the universe  
Thinking is the best way to travel

Cold hearted orb that rules the night  
Removes the colors from our sight  
Red is gray and yellow white  
But we decide which is right  
And which is an illusion  
  
Pinprick holes in a colorless sky  
Let insipid figures of light pass by  
The mighty light of ten thousand suns  
Challenges infinity and is soon gone  
  
Nighttime to some, a brief interlude  
To others the fear of solitude  
Brave Helios, wake up your steeds  
Bring the warmth the countryside needs

When the white eagle of the North is flying overhead  
The browns, reds and golds of autumn lie in the gutter, dead.  
Remember then, that summer birds with wings of fire flaying  
Came to witness springs new hope, born of leaves decaying.  
Just as new life will come from death, love will come at leisure.  
Love of love, love of life and giving without measure  
Gives in return a wondrous yearn of a promise almost seen.  
Live hand-in-hand and together we'll stand on the threshold of a dream.

We're living in the land of make-believe  
And trying not to let it show  
Maybe in that land of make-believe  
Heartaches can turn into joy.  
We're breathing in the smoke of high and low  
We're taking up a lot of room  
Somewhere in the dark and silent night  
Our prayer will be heard, make it soon.  
So fly little bird  
Up into the clear blue sky  
And carry the word  
Love's the only reason why, why.  
OPen up the shutters on your windows  
Unlock all the locks upon your doors  
Brush away the cobwebs from your day-dreams  
No secrets come between us any more  
Oh say it's true  
Only love will see you through  
You know what love can do to you.  
We're living in a land of make-believe  
And trying not to let it show  
Maybe in that land of make-believe  
Heartaches can turn into joy.  
We're breathing in the smoke of high and low  
We're taking up a lot of room  
Somewhere in the dark and lonely night  
Our prayer will be heard, make it soon.  
So fly little bird  
Up into the clear blue sky  
And carry the word  
Love's the only reason why, why.  
Open up the shutters on your windows  
Unlock all the locks upon your doors  
Brush away the cobwebs from your day-dreams  
No secrets come between us any more  
Oh say it's true  
Only love will see you through  
You know what love can do to you.  

The atmosphere  
On the streets tonight  
Is the driving beat  
Of the world.  
  
The word down here  
On the streets tonight  
Is the truest music  
You've heard.  
  
So take your share  
Of the gifts that are there,  
They all belong to you  
And, come what may,  
At the break of each day,  
We all begin anew once more.  
  
We all begin anew  
  
[Chorus]  
Baby, baby, baby  
Let's investigate  
The other side of life tonight.  
The lovers and the fighters  
And the risks they take  
Are on the other side of life tonight.  
Let's lose our way,  
Go completely astray  
And find ourselves again.  
You know the only way to get there  
Is to take that step  
To the other side of life tonight.  
  
The atmosphere  
On the streets tonight  
Is the driving beat  
Of the world.  
The word down here  
On the streets tonight  
Is the truest music  
You've heard.  
  
So take your share  
Of the gifts that are there,  
They all belong to you  
And, come what may,  
At the break of each day,  
We all begin anew once more.  
We all begin anew  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Let's lose our way,  
Go completely astray  
And find ourselves again.  
You know the only way to get there  
Is to take that step  
To the other side of life tonight.

The sun and moon every day,  
Day and night, mark my play.  
See the future in the past,  
Try to change or make it last.  
Go for broke, don't regret,  
Get your hands dirty, get your feet wet,  
Take your place, use me well,  
I'm in your hands so make me tell.  
A broken dream seems unkind  
But I can help for I am time.  
I can heal you.  
It's not a matter of sleight  
Only of sound.  
Let me... feel for you,  
Feel for yourself,  
The love all around.  
I can... lead you.  
Is your soul afraid  
Of what you've made?  
Do you know the way  
The spirit goes?  
  
All around, on the wind  
Distant whispers of what I bring,  
In the day in the night,  
Locked in the words of lovers' delight.  
If I'm lost or mislaid  
Just keep looking, don't be afraid.  
In the eye, on the mind,  
I'm everything and yours to find.  
I'm not far, just discover.  
I'm in you for I am love.  
  
I can heal you.  
It's not a matter of sleight  
Only of sound.  
Let me... feel for you,  
Feel for yourself,  
The love all around.  
I can... lead you.  
Is your soul afraid  
Of what you've made?  
Do you know the way  
The spirit goes?

When the sun goes down,  
And the clouds all frown,  
Night has begun for the sunset.  
See it with your eyes,  
Earth re-energized  
By the sun's rays every day.  
Take a look out there,  
Planets everywhere.  
When the sun goes down  
And the clouds all frown,  
Night has begun for the sunset.  
Shadows on the ground  
Never make a sound,  
Fading away in the sunset.  
Night has now become  
Day for everyone.  
  
I can see it all  
From this great height.  
I can feel the sun  
Slipping out of sight  
And the world still goes on  
Through the night.

Time goes by  
Seems like the blink of an eye  
It's so crazy  
What can we do  
It's so strange  
Life in the really slow lane  
Take it easy  
That's what we'll do  
Just me and you  
In the wide outside  
See the swallow as he glides  
Like a spiral up to freedom  
We're all right  
Maybe get lucky tonight  
Only lovers feel like we do  
We take our time  
Leave all our worries behind  
No more mind games  
Simple and true  
That's what we'll do  
In the wide outside  
See the swallow as he glides  
Like a spiral up to freedom  
Time goes by  
Seems like the blink of an eye  
It's so crazy  
What can we do  
It's so strange  
Life in the really slow lane  
Take it easy  
That's what we'll do  
Just me and you  
That's what we'll do  
Just me and you  
That's what we'll do  

Won't you take me back to school?  
I need to learn the golden rule.  
Won't you lay it on the line?  
I need to hear it just one more time.  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  
  
Each and every heart it seems,  
Is bounded by a world of dreams.  
Each and every rising sun,  
Is greeted by a lonely one.  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  
  
Cause out on the ocean of life my love.  
There a so many storms we must rise above.  
Can you hear the spirit calling, as it's carried across the waves?  
You're already falling it's calling you back to face the music.  
And the song that is coming through.  
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you.  
  
My a promise take a vow.  
And trust your feelings it easy now.  
Understand The Voice within.  
And feel a change already beginning.  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight? Tonight?  
  
Oh, won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?  
  
And how many words have I got to say?  
And how many times will it be this way?  
With your arms around the future and your back up against the past.  
You're already falling it's calling you on to face the music.  
And the song that is coming through.  
You're already falling the one that it's calling is you.  
  
Each and every heart it seems,  
Is bounded by a world of dreams.  
Each and every rising sun,  
Is greeted by, a lonely, lonely one.  
  
Won't you tell me again?  
Oh, can you feel it?  
Oh, won't you tell me again tonight?

This garden universe vibrates complete  
Some may get a sound so sweet  
Vibrations reach on up to become light  
And then through gamma, out of sight  
Between the eyes and ears there lie  
The sounds of color and the light of a sigh  
And to hear the sun, what a thing to believe  
But it's all around if we could but perceive  
To know ultra violet, infra-red and X-rays  
Beauty to find in so many ways  
Two notes of the chord, that's our full scope  
But to reach the chord is our life's hope  
And to name the chord is important to some  
So they give a word and the word is Om  

This is the moment  
This is the day  
This is the moment  
When I know  
I am on my way  
Every endeavour  
I have made ever  
Is coming into play  
Is here and now today  
  
This is the moment  
This the time  
When the momentum  
And the moment  
are in rhyme  
Give me this moment  
My precious chance  
I'll gather up my best  
And make some sense at last  
  
This is the moment  
When all I've done  
All of the dreaming,  
scheming and screaming  
becomes one  
This is the day,  
Just see it shine  
When all that I have lived for  
Becomes mine  
  
This is the moment  
This is the hour  
When I can open up,  
tomorrow  
like a flower  
And put my hand to  
Everything I plan to  
Fulfill my grand desire  
See all my stars align  
  
This is the moment  
My final test  
Destiny beckoned  
I never reckoned second best  
I won't look back  
I must not fall  
This is the moment  
The sweetest moment  
Of them all  
  
This is the moment  
So double the odds  
This day or never  
I'll sit forever  
with the gods  
When I look back  
I will recall  
Moment for moment  
This was the moment  
The greatest moment of them all.

Rain on the river turns the torrent to a flood  
Swim or you'll never rise above  
Two lonely people can mend a broken heart  
Love and you'll never fall apart  
But can you tell me why?  
They made a good bowl of chili at the jazz club  
They played a good game of football in Mucron  
They ripped everyone off at the top rank, babe  
If you could ever get into their suite  
Avenue, Tombola and Social  
We just drove right on by  
We was on our way to the big time, babe  
To the great gold record in the sky  
Sun in the morning brings the flowers from a bud  
Hail to the giver, life and love  
Two lonely people can mend a broken heart  
Love and you'll never fall apart  
But can you tell me why?  
They made a good bowl of chili at the jazz club  
They played a good game of football in Mucron

We just drove right on by

Can you tell me, tell me why?  
To the great gold record in the sky  

You know he's moving fast,  
Be he's still going slow,  
He's ahead in the race,  
And there is not far to go,  
And your load is so heavy  
And your legs want to rest.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
  
You think he's way up in front  
But he's so far behind.  
He's asleep in the grass,  
And he's run out of time.  
While your load was so heavy  
You never wanted to stop.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
  
Your friend is heavy  
But he was ready  
And never stopped for a while  
And while you were sleeping  
He went on keeping the final line in his mind.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
Your friend is heavy  
But he was ready  
And never stopped for a while  
And while you were sleeping  
He went on keeping the final line in his mind.  
  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.  
It's all right, it's all right, it's all right.

Tuesday afternoon  
I'm just beginning to see  
Now I'm on my way  
It doesn't matter to me  
Chasing the clouds away  
  
Something calls to me  
The trees are drawing me near  
I've got to find out why  
Those gentle voices I hear  
Explain it all with a sigh  
  
I'm looking at myself reflections of my mind  
It's just the kind of day to leave myself behind  
So gently swaying through the fairyland of love  
If you'll just come with me you'll see the beauty of  
Tuesday afternoon  
Tuesday afternoon  
  
Tuesday afternoon  
I'm just beginning to see  
Now I'm on my way  
It doesn't matter to me  
Chasing the clouds away  
  
Something calls to me  
The trees are drawing me near  
I've got to find out why  
Those gentle voices I hear  
Explain it all with a sigh

Twilight time to dream awhile,  
In veils of deepening blue.  
As fantasy strides, over colourfull skies,  
Of form disappearing from view.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
A nightingale plays a dark mellow phrase,  
Of notes that are rich and so true.  
An aerial display by the firefly brigade,  
Dancing to tunes no one knew.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
Building castles in the air,  
Whistling to the wind.  
As nature bows down her head,  
See what tomorrow brings.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
  
Bats take to wing like puppets on string,  
Prancing through cool evening air.  
In a sightless glide, no reason to hide  
Away from the sun's blinding stare.  
  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.  
In twilight time, dream with me awhile.

The dawn crept into by room  
And stole my dream  
Now I'll never know  
Just what it means  
Or what could have been  
Yet still I try to lie  
But I'm seen  
  
Under moonshine that's where I've been  
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen  
Under moonshine that's where I've been  
Under moonshine I'm clearly seen  
  
Creator of dreams that melt with the sun  
I'll send you the things this man has done  
He was a saint and a sinner rolled in one  
But I miss now that he's gone  
I sure miss him now that he's gone  
  
Sure I feel the pain  
Deep inside I pour like rain  
Remember when you smile  
Love's in your eyes  
  
The world keeps turning  
The grass still grows green  
The fruit on my tree  
Is the biggest you've ever seen  
Which way up you know when you're down  
They've gotta stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
You must stand tall  
With your feet on the ground  
  
Or maybe I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy  
But I'll have my days  
When I do as I please  
For you won't see the woods  
While you're a tree  
No you'll never see the woods  
While you're a tree  
  
Yes I'm crazy  
Also they say I'm lazy  
But I'll have my days  
When I do as I please  
You won't see the woods  
While you're a tree  
No you'll never see the woods  
While you're a tree

It's a hard life  
Never let yourself get down  
You may never get back  
You may never ever turn it round  
You may say it took you by surprise  
Never ending  
Never changing  
I didn't see through your disguise  
It took my breath away  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Under my feet  
The earth just fell away  
Under my feet  
Gave way  
  
Did you ever want to take a chance  
Never thought the time would come round  
Quite so fast  
Would you walk right thro' that wall  
And keep on walking till you  
Couldn't stand on your feet no more  
But you came and took me by surprise  
When you stole up on me  
I didn't see thro' your disguise  
It took my breath away  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Under my feet  
The earth just fell away  
Under my feet - gave way  
  
Where were you  
When I needed you  
Where were you  
When I needed you  
Where were you  
Where were you - I'm holding on  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Under my feet  
The earth just fell away  
Under my feet - gave way  
  
Under my feet  
The earth shook  
Right under my feet  
Gave way

The lights go down  
The stage is set  
The man in the wings breaks out in sweat  
A backstage joker spiked his coke  
While the dressing room was full of smoke  
A crowd of fools got him high  
He's afraid he's gonna die  
He's the apple of their eye  
  
He steps into the remaining light  
The crowd go wild  
He's outa sight  
Arms held high in the sign of peace  
His manager signed the one night lease  
The house is full getting high  
He's afraid he's gonna die  
He's the apple of their eye  
(He struts, he strolls)  
(His love is rock 'n' roll)  
He's the VETERAN COSMIC ROCKER  
  
He steps into the remaining light  
The crowd go wild  
Arms held high in the sign of peace  
His manager signed the one night lease  
The house is full getting high  
He's afraid he's gonna die  
He's the apple of their eye  
(He struts, he strolls)  
(His life is rock 'n' roll)  
He's the VETERAN COSMIC ROCKER  
He's afraid that he will die

Watching and waiting  
For a friend to play with  
Why have I been alone so long  
Mole he is burrowing his way to the sunlight  
He knows there's some there so strong  
  
'Cause here there's lot of room for doing  
The thing you've always been denied  
Look and gather all you want to  
There's no one here to stop you trying  
  
Soon you will see me  
'Cause I'll be all around you  
But where I come from I can't tell  
But don't be alarmed by my fields and my forests  
They're here for only you to share  
  
'Cause here there's lot of room for doing  
The things you've always been denied  
So look and gather all you want to  
There's no one here to stop you trying  
  
Watching and waiting  
For someone to understand me  
I hope it won't be very long

Pale the young squire who goes to fight  
To die at his master's side  
Living is just a dream inside  
You ask me why he cried  
"What am I doin' here?"  
"What am I doin' here?"  
  
Beautiful princess, fair and pale  
Stares out across the sea  
Alone in her castle dark and grey  
Her love she'll never see  
"What am I doin' here?"  
"What am I doin' here?"  
  
Tenderly bury the fair young dead  
Place a wooden cross at his head  
All the words you can say  
Have been said  
It's for you my tears are shed  
  
What can be done, you won't believe  
Listen and you may see  
Everyone's dream is deep within  
Find it and you'll be free  
"What am I doin' here?"  
"What am I doin' here?"  
  
Tenderly bury the fair young dead  
Place a wooden cross at his head  
All the words you can say  
Have been said  
It's for you my tears are shed  
  
Tenderly bury the fair young dead  
Place a wooden cross at his head  
All the words you can say  
Have been said  
It's for you my tears are shed

What child is this, who, laid to rest  
On Mary's lap, is sleeping?  
Whom angels greet with anthems sweet  
While shepherds watch are keeping  
  
This, this is Christ the King  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing  
Haste, haste to bring him laud  
The babe, the son of Mary  
  
This, this is Christ the King,  
Whom shepherds guard and angels sing:  
Haste, haste to bring him laud,  
The babe, the son of Mary  
The babe, the son of Mary  
The babe, the son of Mary

A ray of hope flickers in the sky  
A tiny spark lights up way up high  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A silent wish sails the seven seas  
The winds of change whisper in the trees  
And the walls of doubt crumble, tossed and torn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
A rosy hue settles all around  
You've got the feel you're on solid ground  
For a spell or two, no one seems forlorn  
This comes to pass when a child is born  
It's all a dream, an illusion now  
It must come true, sometime soon, somehow  
All across the land dawns a brand new morn  
This comes to pass when a child is born.

Now as we speed a little faster through the stars  
To this new world of ours  
With the seed that the garden requires  
  
And as we drift a little further from the shore  
Like the sea evermore  
I'm the ivy that clings round your door  
  
When you wake up  
You will find  
That you're not where you left yourself  
  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh  
  
Now as we drift a little further down the stream  
Was it all what it seemed  
Was it true  
Was it real  
Or just a dream  
  
When you wake up  
You will find  
That you're not where you left yourself  
  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh  
  
Now as we speed a little faster through the stars  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh  
Ahhhh

Time quickly passes by  
If only we could talk again  
Someday, I know I'll see you smiling  
When you're a free man again  
High on a mountain side  
We laughed and talked of things to come  
Someway, I know I'll see you shining  
When we're all free men again  
You left your country for peace of mind  
And something tells me you're doin' alright  
How are the children and Rosemarie?  
I long to see you and be in your company  
Someday, I hope I'll see you smiling  
When you're a free man again  
I often wonder, why  
Our world has gone so far astray?  
Someway, I know I'll see you shining  
When we're all free men again  
You gave love freely to those with tears  
Your eyes were sad then you saw the need  
You know that love lasts for eternity  
Let's be God's children and live in perfect peace  
Peace, perfect peace, perfect peace, peace  
Someway I know I'll see you shining  
When you're a free man  
When we're all free men again, yeah  
When you're a free man  

These times have passed and gone  
It's time that we moved on  
Into a new tomorrow  
And leave behind the hurt  
The sorrow and the pain  
'Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Wherever you are  
Wherever you go  
Wherever you stand  
Let your shadow show  
Whatever you think  
Whatever you do  
Whatever you want  
Let your feelings show  
These times have passed and gone  
It's time that we moved on  
Into a new tomorrow  
And leave behind the hurt  
The sorrow and the pain  
'Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
'Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
Just like the winter sun  
That hides behind the dawn  
Just like the shifting sands  
That ride upon the storm  
Tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
'Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
'Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  
'Cause tonight will never  
Pass this way again  

I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
Just like the ones I used to know  
Where the tree tops glisten  
And children listen  
To hear sleigh bells in the snow  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
I'm dreaming of a white Christmas  
With every Christmas card I write  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white  
May your days be merry and bright  
And may all your Christmases be white.

Words you say to me  
I listen in sympathy  
But I don't know what it is  
That makes me ignore you  
I hear you every night  
I listen but the words don't seem right  
My mind seems somewhere else  
What else can I tell you?  
I don't know what to do  
I'm losing you  
Something I can't control  
You are in my heart and soul  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
Words you say to me  
I'm living in fantasy  
If I don't know what it is  
I simply ignore you  
I hear you every night  
I listen but the time is never right  
My life is so confused  
What more can I tell you?  
Don't turn and walk away  
Don't leave this way  
Something I can't control  
You are in my heart and soul  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  
I don't want to wake up now  

The spirit of Christmas is the spirit of love  
Still there when the innocence has gone  
But we have each other we laugh and we cry  
The cares of the world still carry on  
Yes, I believe in a better world  
And like the rest of us I pray  
For peace on this earth and a better life  
With every beautiful day  
I once met a holy man who showed me the way  
The road to tranquility at last  
The more he was listening, the more he would say  
With the tales of the days of future passed  
He said, "Yes, I believe in a better world  
And like the rest of us I try  
To hold on to hope for a better life  
With every day that goes by"  
And if we dare to dream of paradise unseen  
It might come true and if you stand by me  
I swear with all my heart, I'll stand by you  
Yes, I believe in a better world  
A world where my sisters can be free  
And I have a place in my brother's heart  
For everybody to see  
I dream of my destiny, my days in the sun  
To live in the garden of our love  
I search for some happiness, I search for my soul  
I pray for some strength from God above  
Yes, I believe in a better world  
And like the rest of us, I pray  
For peace on this earth and a better life  
With every beautiful day, with every beautiful day  

You don't even know my name  
Time was when you would  
Take the love you've given all away  
Take a part of me  
  
You don't even walk my road  
Can't find where you turned  
Looked away and you were gone  
Now we're on our own  
Old man is this why we're alone  
  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me  
  
You don't even know my world  
I've tried hard to see  
If I'd found the world you're looking for  
There'd be a change in me  
  
You don't even know my name  
Time was when you would  
Take the love you've given all away  
Take a part of me  
You've gone and changed the world I see  
  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me  
I, I believe  
What is lost for ever has brought the change in me

There's a leafless tree in Asia.  
Under the sun there's a homeless man.  
There's a forest fire in the valley  
Where the story all began.  
  
What will be our last thought?  
Do you think it's coming soon?  
Will it be of comfort  
Or the pain of a burning wound?  
  
All we are trying to say  
Is we are all we've got.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, never, stop.  
  
You're an ocean full of faces,  
And you know that we believe.  
We're just a wave that drifts around you,  
Singing all our hopes and dreams.  
We look around, in wonder,  
At the work that has been done.  
By the visions of our father,  
Touched by his loving son.  
  
All we are trying to say  
Is we are all we've got.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, never, stop.  
All we are trying to say  
Is we are all we've got.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, never, stop.  
You and me just cannot fail  
If we never, ever, never, ever, stop...

I don't know what I'm searching for,  
I never have opened the door.  
Tomorrow may find me at last,  
Turning my back on the past.  
But time will tell of stars that fell,  
A million years ago.  
Memories can never take you back,  
Home, sweet, home.  
You can never go home any more.  
All my life I never really knew me till today.  
Now I know I'm just another step along the way.  
I lie awake for hours,  
I'm just waiting for the sun,  
When the journey we are making has begun.  
Don't deny the feeling,  
That is stealing through your heart,  
Every happy ending needs to have a start.  
All my life I never really knew me till today.  
Now I know I'm just another step along the way.  
Weep no more for treasures,  
You've been searching for in vain,  
'cause the truth is gently falling with the rain.  
High above the forests,  
Lie the pastures of the sun,  
Where the two that learned the secret now are one.  
I don't know what I'm searching for,  
I never have opened the door.  
Tomorrow might find me at last,  
Turning my back on the past.  
But time will tell of stars that fell,  
A million years ago.  
Memories can never take you back,  
Home, sweet, home.  
You can never go home any more.
