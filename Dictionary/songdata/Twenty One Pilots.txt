I don't fall slow like I used to  
I fall straight down  
You've stolen my air catcher  
That kept me safe and sound  
  
My parachutes will guide me  
Safely to ground  
But now the cord's not working  
And I see you staring me down  
  
[Chorus]  
I won't fall in  
Love with falling  
I will try to avoid  
Those eyes  
[End Chorus]  
  
I think you would beat  
The moon in a pretty contest  
And the moon just happened to be  
The very first thing that I missed  
  
I was doing fine on my own  
And there wasn't much I lacked  
But you've stolen my air catcher  
And I don't know if I want it back  
  
[Chorus]  
  
'Cause I'm not sure  
I want to give you  
Tools that can destroy  
My heart  
  
And I just don't say  
What you want to hear  
So I'll write my fears  
And I don't believe  
In talking just to breathe  
And falling selfishly  
  
[Chorus]  
  
But now I'm here  
To give you words  
As tools that can destroy  
My heart

Where'd you go, huh?  
They all think I know you,  
Yeah, it's so hard to motivate me to devote  
A single inch of me to something I can't see,  
I don't mean to pry but why  
Would you even make the eyes?  
I don't believe my ears,  
And I'm scared of my own head,  
I will deny you for years and  
I'll make you raise me from the dead,  
And if I said that I would live for you for nothing in return,  
Well, I'm sorry Mr. Gullible,  
But lying's all I've learned,  
So be concerned (x2)  
  
No music,  
And I can talk about anything  
Whether or not it's worthwhile  
Is based on who's listening,  
Most of us listening for something we can relate to,  
All of us related for something we just been through,  
Taken for granted trust is damaged and now we panic,  
Livin empty-handed living lives like we can manage,  
I can feel you but still know where home is feeling like Jonah did,  
Almost dropped the bat like every base was fully loaded,  
So be concerned (x2)  
  
I am disappearing  
Inside my birds-eye theories,  
I try to say goodbye, defy and deny,  
What it is I'm fearing  
Clearly I am dying,  
Dearly I am writing,  
Merely testifying that a test to fly requires  
I pass the test with colors flying,  
I don't believe you most the time,  
I'm lying 'cause I say I am fine,  
You are the pearl, I am the swine,  
So break my life and take this rhyme,  
I'm so sorry but I do believe  
That all my bridges I have burned,  
And I've earned a policy of no return,  
So be concerned (x4)

[Verse 1]  
Turn away  
If you could get me a drink  
Of water 'cause my lips are chapped and faded  
Call my aunt Marie  
Help her gather all my things  
And bury me in all my favorite colors  
My sisters and my brothers  
Still  
I will not kiss you  
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you  
  
[Chorus]  
I will not kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
Kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
[Verse 2]  
Now turn away  
'Cause I'm awful just to see  
And all my hairs abandoned all my body  
All my agony  
Know that I will never marry  
Baby, I'm just soggy from the chemo  
I'm counting down the days to go  
This just ain't livin'  
And I just hope you know  
  
[Chorus]  
I will not kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
Kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (call my)  
(Turn away)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
  
[Bridge]  
If you say (if you say)  
Goodbye today (goodbye today)  
I'll ask you to be true (I'll ask you to be true)  
'Cause the hardest part of this is leaving you  
Yes, the hardest part of this...  
  
[Outro]  
I will not kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (Call my)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)  
Kiss you (kiss you)  
Lips are chapped and faded  
Call my (Call my)  
Lips are chapped and faded (faded)

I wish that I had two faces to prove which theory works,  
Yelling on the street corner or cleverly masking your words,  
I take my face off at the door 'cause I don't know who they will take me for,  
I wonder if I tell them what I did last night,  
Whether or not I got caught, they just might,  
Wage war on you, therefore it's true,  
That I shot my general on my side of enemy lines.  
  
[2x]  
I'm the son of all I've done,  
I'm the son of all I've done,  
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood.  
  
I'm not trying to be lying to you,  
But it takes a clever guy to do what I do,  
It takes some chivalry and well placed energy,  
To subliminally get yourself inside you,  
Introspection is the name of this session,  
Spread this infection, reflect it on the next one,  
The next one, the next one, and when we're done,  
We'll all have made something new under the sun,  
I'm not done, I'm not done yet, no,  
Kick me off the stage and take my microphone,  
Then you'll walk up to me and when you get close,  
I'll look you in the face and say, "Where's your home?  
Where are you going and why are you here?"  
Have you asked these questions? Have you been sincere?  
Want to know what I believe? It's right here,  
Dig a little deeper and it's crystal clear.  
  
[2x]  
I'm the son of all I've done,  
I'm the son of all I've done,  
Impostor, been fostered, then my new father drained my dirty blood.  
  
[x3]  
I will tell you what I can,  
But your mind will take a stand,  
I sing of a greater love,  
Let me know when you've had enough.

I'm fairly local, I've been around  
I've seen the streets you're walking down  
I'm fairly local, good people now  
  
I'm evil to the core  
What I shouldn't do I will  
They say I'm emotional  
What I want to save I'll kill  
Is that who I truly am?  
I truly don't have a chance  
Tomorrow I'll keep a beat  
And repeat yesterday's dance  
  
Yo, this song will never be on the radio  
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral  
The world around us is burning but we're so cold  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
  
I'm fairly local, I've been around  
I've seen the streets you're walking down  
I'm fairly local, good people now  
  
I'm not evil to the core  
What I shouldn't do I will fight  
I know I'm emotional  
What I want to save I will try  
I know who I truly am  
I truly do have a chance  
Tomorrow I'll switch the beat  
To avoid yesterday's dance  
  
Yo, this song will never be on the radio  
Even if my clique were to pick and the people were to vote  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
Yo, you, bulletproof in black like a funeral  
The world around us is burning but we're so cold  
It's the few, the proud, and the emotional  
  
I'm fairly local, I've been around  
I've seen the streets you're walking down  
I'm fairly local, good people now

I want to drive away  
In the night, headlights call my name  
  
I, I'll never be, be what you see inside  
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified  
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?  
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far  
  
And I'll fall  
And I'll break  
And I'll fake  
All I wanna  
  
And I'll fall down  
And I'll break down  
And I'll fake you out  
All I wanna  
  
I'm so afraid  
Of what you have to say  
Cause I am quiet now  
And silence gives you space  
  
I'll never be, be what you see inside  
You say I'm not alone, but I am petrified  
You say that you are close, is close the closest star?  
You just feel twice as far, you just feel twice as far  
  
And I'll fall  
And I'll break  
And I'll fake  
All I wanna  
  
And I'll fall down  
And I'll break down  
And I'll fake you out  
All I wanna  
  
It's the same game today as it always is  
I don't give these places fake my name explaining this  
And the wrists of my mind have the bleeding lines  
That remind me of all the times  
I have committed  
Dirty dirty crimes that are perfectly form-fitted  
To what I've done and what I'm doing  
I'm brewing and losing and spewing infusing  
And believe me that's what all the kids are doing  
What kids are doing are killing themselves  
They feel they have no control of their prisoner's cell  
And if you're one of them then you're one of me  
And you would do almost anything just to feel free  
Am I right? Of course I am  
Convince me otherwise would take all night  
Before you walk away, there's one more thing I want to say  
Our brains are sick but that's okay  
  
And I'll fall  
And I'll break  
And I'll fake  
All I wanna  
  
All I wanna  
Yeah, and I'll fall down  
And I'll break down  
And I'll fake you out  
All I wanna  
Yeah, and I'll fall down  
And I'll break down  
And I'll fake you out  
All I wanna  
  
I'm so afraid  
Of what you have to say  
'Cause I am quiet now  
And silence gives you space

I feel for you but when did you  
Believe you were alone?  
You say that spiders crawled inside  
And made themselves a home  
Where light once was.  
  
Petrified of who you are and  
Who you have become.  
You will hide from everyone,  
Denying you need someone  
To exterminate your bones.  
  
[Chorus]  
Friend, please remove your hands from  
Over your eyes for me.  
I know you want to leave but  
Friend, please don't take your life away from me.  
[End Chorus]  
  
Living like a ghost you walk  
By everyone you know.  
You say that you're fine but  
You have lost your sway a glow.  
So I stopped by to let you know.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Would you let me know your plans tonight?  
'Cause I just won't let go till we both see the light.  
And I have nothing else left to say.  
But I will listen to you all day.  
Yes I will.  
  
Friend, please remove your hands from  
Over your eyes for me.  
I know you want to leave but  
Friend, please don't take your life away from me.

I know what you think in the morning  
When the sun shines on the ground  
And shows what you have done  
It shows where your mind has gone  
And you swearing to your parents  
That it will never happen again  
I know, I know oh oh, what that means, I know oh oh oh oh  
  
That you all have guns  
And you never put the safety on  
And you all have plans,  
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it  
  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
But I can't, but I can't when you all have  
Guns for hands yeah  
  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
But I can't, but I can't when you all have  
Guns for hands yeah  
  
Let's take this a second at a time  
Let's take this one song, this one rhyme  
Together, let's breathe  
Together, to the beat  
But there's hope out the window  
So that's where we'll go  
Let's go outside and all join hands  
But until then you'll never understand  
  
That you all have guns  
And you never put the safety on  
And you all have plans  
To take it, to take it, don't take it, take it, take it  
  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
But I can't, but I can't when you all have  
Guns for hands yeah  
  
We've turned our hands to guns, trade in our thumbs for ammunition  
I must forewarn you, of my disorder, or my condition  
'Cause when the sun sets, it upsets what's left of my invested interest  
Interested in putting my fingers to my head  
The solution is, I see a whole room of these mutant kids  
Fused at the wrist, I simply tell them they should shoot at this  
Simply suggest my chest and this confused music, it's  
Obviously best for them to turn their guns to a fist  
  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
But I can't, but I can't when you all have  
Guns for hands  
  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
I'm trying, I'm trying to sleep  
But I can't, but I can't when you all have  
Guns for hands

I'm taking over my body  
Back in control, no more shotty  
I bet a lot of me was lost  
"T"'s uncrossed and "I"'s undotted  
I fought it a lot and it seems a lot  
Like flesh is all I got  
Not any more, flesh out the door  
  
I must'a forgot, you can't trust me  
I'm moment-to-moment and close but don't show it  
Before you know it I'm lost at sea  
And now that I write and think about it  
And the story unfolds  
You should take my life  
You should take my soul  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my left-side brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
And I'll be holding on to you  
  
Remember the moment  
You know exactly where you're goin'  
'Cause the next moment before you know it  
Time is slowin' and it's rolling still  
And the windowsill looks really nice, right?  
You think twice about your life  
It probably happens at night, right?  
  
Fight it, take the pain, ignite it  
Tie a noose around your mind  
Loose enough to breath fine and tie it  
To a tree tell it,  
You belong to me, this ain't a noose  
This is a leash and I have news for you  
You must obey me!  
  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Sounding down the mountain range  
Of my left-side brain  
You are surrounding all my surroundings  
Twisting the kaleidoscope  
Behind both of my eyes  
  
Entertain my faith  
  
Lean with it, rock with it  
When we gonna stop with it?  
Lyrics that mean nothing  
We were gifted with thought  
  
Is it time to move our feet  
To an introspective beat  
It ain't the speakers that bump hard  
It's our hearts that make the beat  
  
And I'll be holding on to you

You say things with your mouth,  
Cobwebs and flies come out.  
I hear a second voice  
Behind your tongue somehow.  
  
Luckily, I can read your mind,  
Cobwebs and flies unwind.  
They will not take you down,  
They will not cast you out.  
  
Dear friend, here we are again, pretending how you think the world is ending,
sending signals and red flags in waves. It's hard to tell the difference
between blood and water these days. I pray that one day you'll see that the
only difference between life and dying is one is trying, that's all we're
gonna do, so try to love me and I'll try to save you.  
  
[Chorus]  
Won't you stay alive?  
I'll take you on a ride.  
I will make you believe  
You are lovely.  
[End Chorus](2x)  
  
Your redemption won't go stale,  
We are not just setting sail  
On the seas of what we fear  
Treason now is growing near to me.  
  
I'm coming clean.  
God, hit me straight on.  
God, hit me straight on.  
  
[Chorus](2x)  
  
You say things with your mouth,  
Cobwebs and flies come out.  
I hear a second voice  
Behind your tongue somehow.  
  
Lovely, I can read your mind.  
  
Don't be gone (5x)  
  
You say things with your mouth,  
Cobwebs and flies come out. (7x)

There's miles of land in front of us,  
And we're dying with every step we take,  
We're dying with every breath we make,  
And all fall in line.  
  
A stranger's back is all I see,  
He's only a few feet in front of me,  
And all look left and right sometimes,  
But all fall in line.  
  
No one looks up anymore,  
'Cause you might get a raindrop in your eye,  
And heaven forbid, they see you cry,  
As we fall in line.  
  
And about this time of every year,  
The Line will go to the ocean pier,  
And walk right off into the sea,  
Then we fall asleep.  
  
As we near the end of land,  
And our ocean graves are just beyond the sand,  
I ask myself the question, why  
I fall in line.  
  
Then out of the corner of my eye,  
I see a spaceship in the sky,  
And hear a voice inside my head:  
"Follow me instead."[2x]  
  
Follow me.  
  
Then the wages of war will start,  
Inside my head with my counterpart,  
And the emotionless marchers will chant the phrase:  
"This Line 's the only way."  
  
Then I start down the sand,  
My eyes are focused on the end of land,  
But again the voice inside my head  
Says, "Follow me instead."  
  
Follow me instead.  
  
Follow me.  
  
Follow me instead.[4x]  
  
Take me up. Seal the door.  
I don't want to march here anymore.  
I realize that this Line is dead,  
So I'll follow you instead.  
  
So then you put me back in my place,  
So I might start another day,  
And once again, I will be  
In a march to the sea.

I do not know why I would go  
In front of you and hide my soul  
'Cause you're the only one who knows it,  
Yeah you're the only one who knows it  
  
And I will hide behind my pride  
Don't know why I think I can lie  
'Cause there's a screen on my chest  
Yeah there's a screen on my chest  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm trying to be so cool  
Everything together trying to be so cool  
  
I can't see past my own nose, I'm seeing everything in slo-mo  
Look out below crashing down to the ground just like a vertical locomotive  
That's a train, am I painting the picture that's in my brain?  
A train from the sky, locomotive, my motives are insane  
My flow's not great, okay, I conversate with people  
Who know if I flow on a song I'll get no radio play  
While you're doing fine, there's some people and I  
Who have a really tough time getting through this life  
So excuse us while we sing to the sky.  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
  
[Repeat x3]  
We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken people, oh.  
We're broken people, oh.  
  
[Repeat x2]  
(We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken  
We're broken people, oh.  
We're broken people, oh.)  
  
[Chorus: x2]  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm standing in front of you  
I'm trying to be so cool  
Everything together trying to be so cool

Night falls, with gravity.  
The earth turns, from sanity  
Taking my only friend I know,  
He lives a lie, his name is Hope.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.  
  
The horrors of the night melt away  
Under the warm glow of survival of the day  
Then we move on,  
My shadow grows taller along with my fears  
And my friends shrink smaller as night grows near  
  
When the sun is coming, window soothes  
And the silver lining rides the hills  
I will be saved for one whole day  
Until the sun make the hills its grave  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind.  
  
[Repeat x4]  
I'm semi-automatic,  
My prayers schizophrenic  
But I'll live on, yeah I'll live on, yeah I'll live on  
  
By the time the night wears off, the dust is down  
And shadows burn  
I will rise and stand my ground,  
Waiting for the night's return.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside.  
  
I'm never what I like  
I'm double-sided.  
And I just can't hide  
I kinda like it  
When I make you cry  
'Cause I'm twisted up, I'm twisted up, inside my mind.

This is a story about a scarlet letter... yeah.  
  
It just hit me as I lay my head down,  
No one around,  
In the dark cold night, I hear a sound  
In my head keeping track of everything you've ever said.  
Must be something, but it's nothing, so I just go back to bed.  
  
It's four, crack the door to the hallway of my dreams,  
But it seems that my hallway keeps closing in on me,  
Forcing me out,  
Making me think about you and how you're gone.  
I see four o'five with teary eyes and then I write this song.  
  
[Chorus]  
And I just can't believe that it has to be this way,  
You know we say it seems to me that it was just the other day,  
I saw your face, I saw your light, you ran the race, you fought the fight,  
But now it's all being torn down for me tonight.  
  
And I know it might be a little selfish for me to say,  
But I need to know if you thought of me at all today,  
'Cause everyday, I walk past the place you left five days of the week,  
And now it's ten after four, and I am taken by sleep.  
[End Chorus]  
  
Spending hours on end  
Deciding what I'd say to a friend  
If I ever saw 'em again,  
  
'Cause I don't know if I know, and don't wanna come across the wrong way.  
'Cause I don't know if I know, but I know I wanna see your face today.  
  
Then somebody told me they saw you cry and break down.  
Do you know how hard that is to get around and think about?  
It's not like you to let emotions get the best of things,  
Especially when everything is hanging in the air we breath.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.  
I'll sing a song to you, my- Let's go!  
  
Friend. Yeah(3x)  
  
I'll sing a song to you, my friend.(4x)

Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
  
[Verse 1]  
When the leader of the bad guys sang  
Something soft and soaked in pain  
I heard the echo from his secret hideaway  
He must've forgot to close his door  
As he cranked out those dismal chords  
And his four walls declared him insane  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
I found my way  
Right time wrong place  
As I pled my case  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free  
I know my soul's freezing  
Hell's hot for good reason  
So please, take me  
  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
  
[Verse 2]  
Three lights are lit  
But the fourth one's out  
I can tell cause it's a bit darker  
Than the last night's bout  
I forgot about the drought  
Of light bulbs in this house  
So I head out  
Down a route I think is heading south  
But I'm not good with directions  
And I hide behind my mouth  
I'm a pro at imperfections  
And I'm best friends with my doubt  
And now that my mind's out  
And now I hear it clear and loud  
I'm thinking, 'Wow  
I probably should've stayed inside my house.'  
  
[Pre-Chorus]  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free  
I know my soul's freezing  
Hell's high for good reason  
So please  
  
[Bridge x2]  
I don't know if this song  
Is a surrender or a revel  
I don't know if this one  
Is about me or the devil  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free, Oh no  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free, Oh no  
I know my soul's freezing  
Hell's high for good reason  
So please  
  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
Na Na Na Na Oh Oh  
  
[Chorus]  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free  
You're the judge, Oh no  
Set me free

He wakes up early today,  
Throws on a mask that will alter his face.  
No one knows his real name,  
But now he just uses one he saw on a grave.  
  
He pretends he's okay, but you should see.  
In his bed, late at night he's petrified.  
  
Take me out, finish this waste of a life.  
  
[Chorus]  
Everyone gather around for a show.  
Watch as this man disappears as we know.  
Do me a favor and try to ignore,  
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor.  
[End Chorus]  
  
He thinks that faith might be dead,  
Nothing kills man faster than his own hand.  
He used to dream things at night,  
But now he's just watching the backs of his eyes.  
  
He pretends he's okay, but you should see.  
In his bed, late at night he's petrified.  
  
Take me out, finish this waste of a life.  
  
[Chorus]  
  
Take me out, finish this waste of a life.  
  
Everyone gather around for a show,  
Watch as this man disappears as we know.  
Do me a favor and try to ignore,  
As you watch him fall through a bleeding trapdoor...  
  
'Cause nobody knows his life.

I know  
Where you stand  
Silent  
In the trees  
And that's  
Where I am  
Silent  
In the trees  
  
Why won't you speak?  
Where I happen to be  
Silent  
In the trees  
Standing cowardly  
  
I can feel your breath  
I can feel my death  
I want to know you  
I want to see  
I want to say  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello  
  
I know  
Where you stand  
Silent  
In the trees  
And that's  
Where I am  
Silent  
In the trees  
  
Why won't you speak?  
Where I happen to be  
Silent  
In the trees  
Standing cowardly  
  
I can feel your breath  
I can feel my death  
I want to know you  
I want to see  
I want to say  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello  
Hello
