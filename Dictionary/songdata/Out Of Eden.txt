Right now, I think it's time it be known  
just how I feel about you, father savior.  
I'm sure that you see what's in my heart,  
but just vision is not enough I've gotta tell you.  
More than tell you, anyone can say the words.  
I want to be the one to tell you how I feel.  
You're too much, more than I could know.  
Just my way to say I can't let go of you.  
  
Chorus:  
I can't let go of you  
no matter what the world may tell me.  
Oh,oh, I can't let go of you  
no matter what the world may tell me.  
  
Right now, you are all that I am.  
It's not I, but it's you that liveth in me.  
Where would I be if you ever were to go?  
But I know that you'll never leave me nor forsake me.  
You've brought me into so much light.  
You've kept me safe even at times I've left your side.  
What would I do if I weren't saved by you?  
Can't even imagine that's why I can't let go of you.  
  
Repeat Chorus  
  
You've brought me into so much light.  
You've kept me safe even at times I've left your side.  
What would I do if I weren't saved by you?  
Can't even imagine that's why I can't let go of you.  
  
Repeat Chorus

I've been through so many changes I don't know which way to go  
Yet I've got it so together I can see with my eyes open or with my eyes  
Closed  
Late at night I cry and wonder why my life's goin', goin' nowhere  
But during the day everything is okay, I'm having it my way, I say  
My teachers tell me that I am a lost soul, in a black hole  
But my mind, it tells me that I'm doing just fine  
Oh if everything is peachy, why can't anybody reach me  
I've always said I don't need anybody else  
Chorus:  
I'm so confused  
So confused  
And I'm destined to lose  
Unless I follow another way  
Spent all my time lookin' for something never knew what for  
Tried out all the options just to find that more pain and hurt was in store  
Been through it all, but the one thing that I still run from is you  
Still I remember 'bout all the things my momma said that you could do  
She said that if I only let you in my life  
You could take away the sorrow and the emptiness inside  
But to be true, the life I'm living, it's hard to let it go  
Though I've spent my whole life learning, there's so much that I don't know  
[Chorus: X2]  
I hear you calling, telling me to leave it all behind  
If I could only find the answers to the questions in my mind  
I wonder could it be my mind's not meant to understand  
Maybe I should go with my heart and put my life in your hands  
Surrender to you  
(chorus out)

Woke up this morning, jumped out of bed,  
Hit my head on a lampshade and the clock said  
That I'm running late so I'm rushing trying to get on my way  
(huuuh)get to my car and the gauge is on E,  
Get gas and I pay a dollar ninety-three  
Got stopped by the cops cause I was speeding  
Eighty-nine in a fifty-five Lord, why me  
  
On a day like today,  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on, smile on my face  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
On a day like today,  
Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
  
It's days like this there's a lesson learned  
When I get up on the wrong side of the world  
It's easy to dwell on my situation instead of every good thing  
(but I know I've been blessed) I gotta say thank you  
(and though there's stress) I'm still grateful  
(it's just a test) he's more than able to see me through on a day  
  
On a day like today,  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on, smile on my face  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
On a day like today,  
Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
  
I know it wouldn't hurt to smile  
It's not as bad as it could be it will work out in a while (repeat)  
  
On a day like today,  
All has gone wrong and my life seems crazy  
Gotta hold on, smile on my face  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
On a day like today,  
Look up at the sky and know life's so amazing  
And I know I will be okay  
Cause I know the sun's gonna shine my way  
  
So I just h

Everything is different now  
Look at me and you can see I've change somehow  
You might think it's strange the way I hold it down  
But I know (I know you want it)  
And you know (I know you know)  
I got what you need  
My life is different now  
  
Look and you and I can see you're wonderin how  
Though you think it's strange the way I hold it down  
Know I know (I know you want it)  
And I know (I know you know)  
I got what you need  
Saw you drivin by just the other day  
  
I was riding in my car and my hands were raised  
By the way that I was rockin you thought I was bumpin Biggie or Jay  
But I was steady spinnin Fred cause I could praise for days  
You hollered at me  
I was at the light  
Said I was looking fly and asked what up tonight  
I said I know you used to see me at the clubs til three  
  
But I don't kick it like I did cause there's a change in me  
Everything is different now  
Look at me and you can see I've change somehow  
You might think it's strange the way I hold it down  
But I know (I know you want it)  
And you know (I know you know)  
I got what you need  
My life is different now  
  
Look and you and I can see you're wonderin how  
Though you think it's strange the way I hold it down  
Know I know (I know you want it)  
And I know (I know you know)  
I got what you need  
Some of my girls I hadn't seen in a while  
Saw them at the mall and we traded hugs and a smile  
  
They said we hear you're doing well  
You seem so confident  
I told them that it wasn't me but it was heaven sent  
I saw confusion in their eyes  
Said I'm living right no compromise  
I don't talk I don't dress like I did before  
  
And if you give me just a minute I will tell you more  
I am not the same, God has changed the game  
Found that it's okay, I don't have to live that way  
I am not the same, God has changed the game  
You know it's okay, you don't have to live that way

Chorus:  
Oh no, I'm not the one you see  
So don't you go confusing me  
I've got a different mentality  
I'm trying to be drama free  
You stress me out and that's the truth  
I don't want no substitute  
For the peace of my mind that comes to me  
Cause I'm living drama free  
Can you give me one bit of rest?  
Gotta say you didn't pass the test  
I thought about it but you aint Gods best  
Youre just not what I need  
Tried to run a stupid game on me  
I'm not blind I see quite clearly  
Can't have you disrespecting me  
So I'm gone just like the breeze  
Can you give me just one bit of space?  
Girl I love you but you're driving me insane  
Gossiping always into trouble and then  
You want me to justify  
Tired of hearing stories, he said, she said  
Tired of hearing bout the crazy things you did  
Would you listen to me just once or twice?  
Make a difference in your life  
But you don't now  
Bridge:  
I've made changes I know you see  
No more old this is my new leaf  
Leaving behind all that's stressing me  
Needlessly, drama free  
(Oh oh oh) Can you hear me?  
(Oh oh oh) Can you feel me?  
Its not that I don't care about it  
Its just that I've got to do without it  
(One) My choice to just be done  
(Two) Hope I made it clear to you  
(Three) Something that works for me  
(Four) don't want the drama no more

I woke up on this morning  
And misery surrounded me  
And I am forced to face a day  
I didn't even want to begin  
God knows I'm going through it  
And it's hard to imagine I can make it this time  
As my sadness mounts I pray that this day will end  
Cry myself to sleep and then start again  
  
When the world loses its luster  
And you're feeling sad and lonely  
And you need someone to be there  
In your time of need  
You can turn your eyes to the heavens  
And their creator's watching over you  
With arms of love to hold you and draw you near  
  
You're in the midst of heartache  
Perhaps you've lost a loved one  
Lost all your faith-can barely pray  
For the strength you need to go on  
Well, darling don't give up now  
I know that inevitably this too shall pass  
Trouble doesn't last always  
Hold on through the pain  
I believe the sun will outlast your rain

So many times I've walked this way  
Too many times from you I've strayed  
Fallen way behind, too my former state of mind  
I look around what do I see, so many strugglin' just like me  
Tryin' to live this life, falling down to compromise  
But then I have a question, is that what we're living for?  
Aren't we called to perfection, to strive for so much more  
I find that we have settled too many times  
Should not be so, I think it's time God's letting us know  
Chorus:  
We need to get it right  
No need to walk this way this way no more  
We need to step in the light,  
And find out what we're livin' for  
The voice of God is drawing near  
Only the wisest ones will hear  
Seeing the world today will you choose to go his way  
It doesn't end in choosin', because in all we do  
We're called to keep on goin', pressin' on just to remain true  
(chorus)  
I can see how the other life it must look so nice  
But what lies after it's over far from paradise  
Gotta know there is nothing worth missing the call  
Let me tell you He is calling and you've got to give your all  
(chorus out)  

I'd say I'm always happy if you want me to  
But sometimes it's not the case  
My life is not as perfect as it seems to be  
It's simply God's amazing grace  
I'm here to finally let you know  
What keeps me hanging on  
What keeps me going strong  
I'm here to share His love with you  
There is no need to fear to live this life of love  
  
[Chorus:]  
With a little faith, with a little love  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it  
With a little help sent from God above  
I know we can make it  
I know we can make it through  
  
I know what it takes to be yourself  
Instead of when they put you down  
I can't understand why you choose to hide  
When you should run to the strength I found  
If only you'd see for yourself  
Then you could know the one  
Who loves you so much more  
If only I could help you out  
But God's the only one  
  
What are you waiting for  
  
[Repeat chorus]  
  
It seems to wash away  
Can't find a will to go on  
But I am here to say there's hope  
You must carry on  
Jesus will light your way  
He'll give you all that you need  
No need to be afraid all you've got to do is believe

I've been down and out wondering what it all about  
So many pressures and the burden seemed too much for me to bear  
I tried to fight it, but there were shackles on my hands  
Tried to deny it, 'til oppression took command  
Turned to the Savior and He opened up my eyes  
It caught me by surprise, told me somethin' that was no lie  
Chorus:  
It's a good time, a good time to be free  
It's a good time, time to get free inside  
It's a good time, a good time to believe  
It's a good time, time to get free inside  
Now you're down and out wondering what your life's about  
Try to laugh your fears away, so you party everyday  
What you are feeling, there ain't nothing new to find  
What you don't know is, your life is on the line  
Time to discover, there's so much more to this than just the way you live  
I know someone with freedom to give  
(chorus)  
So let your spirit hear, and put your mind behind  
There's a freedom that only in Him you'll find  
If you heed the call you will have all you need  
'Cause who the Son sets free you know is free, free indeed  
(chorus)  
What do you want to do with your life  
Its up to you, you've got to decide  
There's freedom here if you want it, just make up your mind  
It is a good time  
(chorus)  
(bridge)  
(chorus out)  

All of my life I've dreamed a love would come to me  
It's here and now I know it's more that and other love could be  
I never though I'd know someone who loved me so  
To go as for to die that His love for me would show  
I searched all over but I still couldn't find  
Someone to give me love to heal my hurt and ease my mind  
I sought affection tried everything new  
Didn't even know that I was lost without a clue  
Chorus:  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
You have opened my eyes to a greater love  
I used to be so blind but now it's clear to me  
How your love was displayed by what you did on Calvary  
I've got to tell the world that they might hurt you  
To find what I've found to really see how  
You have captured my soul, you have made me whole  
You have set me free 'cause I have given you control  
You have mended my heart and I have been redesigned  
Lord with everything you are, you have been blowin' my mind  
(chorus)  
It's an eternal fantasy that will never, ever change  
And you know He's rearranged my life  
It's and eternal fantasy that will never go away  
'Cause it's true are-E-A-L-I-T-why  
(bridge)  
(chorus out)  

Dear lord are you there  
Listening to my little prayer  
I don't know exactly what to say  
I've been told that you love me  
Anywhere I call you help me if I thought  
I should let it have it you way  
What I guess I'm trying to say  
Is I need you in my life  
'Cause I know I'm tired of living in the past  
I would like to take chance on a change deep inside  
I believe that this is one that going to last.  
So here is  
  
[Chorus]  
Here is my heart(my heart)  
It's been broken  
Its been woulden  
But I give it al to you if you were love me(if you were love me.. yeah hey)  
Here's my life  
If you want it  
You can have it  
I will give it all to you because you love me  
Love is everything I need  
  
Dear child  
I'm right here  
Trough your worries,trough you fairs  
I've been waiting for you to call my name  
All you know that I here you if you turn to me and trust my brothers to  
You will never feel the same  
Well I'm standing here to say that you need me in your life  
'Cause I know that you can't make it on your own(on your own)  
If you were take chance,let me change you deep inside  
I promise you will never be alone  
So here is  
  
[Chorus]  
  
you can turn to me and know that I will always stand by  
I gave it all for you so can have that gentle peace inside  
I will follow you cause I believe en everything you are  
I am you father ,you are my savior  
And in the matters of the heart  
I am taking yours,and you are taking mine  
  
[Chorus]

Now you've been gone in these streets for like, three weeks now  
I'm startin to worry myself, so come on back now  
Don't want you dealing with a life like me  
Don't want you strung out, don't want to be like me  
Only fourteen and you've been with one child now  
Pregnant with no shoes is where you'll end up now  
You're fourteen, you've got your whole life ahead of you  
What's that twenty year old man got to do with you  
  
I wish-I made a better life for you  
I wish-there was someone you could look up to  
I wish-you did what I say not what I do  
I wish-you'd see the future but I know you  
  
Chorus  
I know-that you want to be in these streets  
I know-you think you gotta hustle to eat  
I know-money doesn't matter to me  
I just want you home  
I know-that you've got to do what you do  
I know-what's that life really doin for you  
I know-that's no way to live your life  
I need you to survive  
  
Little shorty and you want to be a baller now  
Want to ride on twenty-fours like a big timer now  
The respect of your crew that's around you  
On your way to getting kicked out your high school  
Thinking drugs will get you where you need to be  
You might get there but only temporarily  
Before you get there you might be under about 6 feet  
Or behind bars at least five fifty deep  
  
I wish-your daddy was here to help raise you  
I wish-you could see that that life ain't gon' save you  
I wish-you could meet God and He could change you  
I wish-get in your head and rearrange  
I wish-there was someone you could look up to  
I wish-you could see there's another way to get through  
I wish-use your mind and that can't stop you  
I wish-see the future but I know you  
  
Chorus  
  
God has got to hear me  
(hear me when I pray)  
It's heavy on my shoulders  
(make it go away)  
Carrying my babies  
Praying for my brothers  
Carrying for my sisters, my fathers, my mothers  
Hoping that one day soon you'll see  
All you're meant to be  
Come to know the things that are true  
And live the life that's meant for you  
  
Chorus

What you don't know can lead you to the extremes  
Shunning help though you feel a need  
You fear to be caught limping and you lose your place  
And leaning on the everlasting arms is not your taste  
Maybe you've heard those stories, laughed at what you saw on TV  
Or felt disgust as He was used an excuse for bigotry  
But I've got to tell you, that's not what it's all about  
'Cause the truth I know will turn you around  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
I too have been hurt by those who claimed to show the way  
It was crazy, their two faces like night and day  
But you don't stop believing 'cause you once been burned  
In everything there's a lesson learned, oh, yeah yeah  
Man is imperfect, there is just one perfect soul  
So much more loving than than one that you've been shown  
How long is it gonna take for you to realize?  
I wish that you would open your eyes  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
I apologize to you on behalf of the untrue  
Because the God I know would never do the things they do  
Mercy and compassion on the right and on the left  
Can you give anymore than your last breath?  
Oh, too hard to see, well, put your mind aside  
And stop using fear to hide behind  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
If you really knew  
You would change your mind  
If you knew the God I know  
You would have the time  
If you take a chance  
I know you will find  
Everything you need in love  
Everything you need in love of another kind  
Love of another kind  
God's love is enough for you  
And it's waiting if you only  
God's love is enough for you  
And it's waiting if you only  
God's love is enough for you  
And it's waiting if you only knew  
God's love is enough for you  
And it's waiting  

Here I stand at the door of your heart just knockin'  
Won't you let me in I can take away the sin that lies within  
I know what your wanting to say  
But can only think, can only pray that someone hears  
  
You hide all your secrets in that private place  
If you only knew that you mind is open to my eye  
I know the truth, I know what you need to fill the void in you  
If you only knew that it is me  
  
[Chorus]  
It's me, that you are searchin' for  
It's me, that you are thinkin' of  
It's me, that can't live without  
It's me, It's me  
  
Here I am, but still you try everything  
To give you only what I can  
Always hoping that someone'll understand, oh please  
It all awaits you if you just taste and see  
I am what you need  
  
[Chorus]  
  
What did I do to make you turn so very far away  
What's to lose when you have it all to gain  
I know you, and what you are and what you want to be  
If you only knew it's all in me  
  
[Chorus]  
  
It is me, that you're searchin' for  
Nobody else can no one can give you more  
It is me, that you're thinkin' of  
I can show you love, real love

This one right here  
This is to let everybody know  
That you gotta know who you are  
And you gotta know whose you are  
Hey, I know whose I am  
By the way  
Baby boy wait a second hear me out  
You don't know what you're talking about  
Don't know me or how I roll  
Child of the king your flossin don't appeal to me  
Im not impressed with shopping sprees  
Man your game ain't worth my soul  
(Hey boy) I know what you're looking for and it's ain't your night  
(Hey boy) you've got your eyes on me, but Ive got my eyes on high  
(Hey boy) don't you know the difference is in the life Ive found  
(Hey boy) took one chance it turned my life around  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Baby girl I see it from a mile away  
Youre lost and you can't find your way  
Trying to find just who you are  
You need to know  
Youre worth more than your weight in gold  
But gotta let God take control  
Truly be a shining star  
(Hey girl) I know what you're looking for you're not looking right  
(Hey girl) you've got your eyes on everything but on the most high  
(Hey girl) hear me when I say the difference is in the life Ive found  
(Hey girl) take one chance he'll turn your life around  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Its just the way he loves me  
Its just the way he talks to me  
Its just the way he moves me  
Its just the way he sets me free  
Ive never been so happy (repeat)

[Chorus:]  
Lookin' for love in all the wrong places  
Just to find someone that can erase  
The hurt you feel if you could you'd get a potion  
The love of God it flows deeper than an ocean  
Lookin' for love you know that I can show you  
Cause what I got goes on and on and on  
Your heart is broken and you're wondering  
What you can do to ease the hurt and pain you feel  
You're letting these no ones get in closer  
Than they need to cause you're looking for love  
Oh, I got a feeling no one's told you  
No one's bothered at all to give you what you need  
So you're out searchin' for something to hold on to  
But you don't know it's right there if you'd only see  
On your own now, doing your own thing  
Say you don't need nobody's help to make it through  
(But you're really wasting your time) you're still lonely  
(And you know that you're gonna find) that you're only  
Left more empty than you were before, oh but I'm telling you  
Oh you don't have to look around  
Let me tell you 'bout the love that I have found  
Everything that our heart needs, it's just right here  
Right here waiting  
Oh you don't have to look no more  
Real love is knocking on your door  
Everything that your soul needs, it's just right here,  
Right here waiting for you  
[Bridge:]  
Oh my friend I'm telling you, I've been there myself a time or two  
When I was just running round, to find a place for my heart that  
Was beaten down  
There's something you need to see, the One who made you  
Love's you please believe  
He's all you need to get by, you know you're somebody so tell me why you're...  
(repeat chorus)

When troubles come my way,  
I look to you and everything is okay.  
When help seems to disappear,  
I look to you and everything so clear.  
  
When hard nights turn into hard days,  
How I long to see your face.  
When blue skies turn to grey.  
I look to you and then I know it's gonna be a...  
It's gonna be a lovely day.  
  
When I wake up in the morning lord,  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes.  
There's something without warning lord.  
Bears heavy on my mind.  
  
Ooh... then I look to you.  
And the world's alright with me.  
Alright, just one look to you,  
And I know it's gonna be...  
I think it's gonna be a lovely day...  
  
[Chorus: x10]  
A lovely day  
  
When the day that lies ahead of me,  
Seems impossible to face.  
And when someone else instead of me,  
Always seems to know the way,  
You know that's when I look to you.  
  
Then I look to you.  
And the world's alright with me.  
Alright, just one look to you.  
And I know it's gonna be...  
I think it's gonna be a lovely.  
  
[Chorus: x10]  
  
When I wake up in the morning Lord  
And the sunlight hurts my eyes.  
There's something without warning Lord.  
You that it bears heavy on my mind.  
When the day that lies ahead of me,  
Seems impossible to face,  
And when someone else instead of me  
Always seems to know the way  
  
[Chorus: x10]

Let me tell you how it's goin' down  
Let me introduce the new show in town  
Playin' no games, no messin' round  
Taking no prisoners, how's that sound  
Three young ladies, comin' out for you  
Yo, it's been too long since you heard the truth  
So this is the real no substitute  
We've come to lay it down, get it crunk for you  
You tired of hearing songs about things they've got  
When you are dead broke and ain't got a lot  
Got questions and answers they have not  
That's why we came here, to blow up the spot  
You're ready for something new  
Something more than my new car or my brand new shoes  
My Burberry this or my 22's  
Well, listen close as we break it down for you  
[chorus 2x]  
Make way for the crew, shout it  
We comin' through, shout it  
You know how we do, shout it  
We're makin' moves, shout it  
I know you feel this beat  
So bump it in the clubs  
And bang it in your Jeeps  
Cause you just can't get enough  
We represent for G-O-D  
Full of life, bringing positivity  
Livin' right cause that's the way  
Fully clothed and that's okay  
Trying to give a new point of view  
Cause you to think  
The message that your life can be new  
That's what we bring  
You're wasting years and air you breath  
No clue about your destiny  
Great is what you're meant to be  
Here's the light for you to see  
Cause we're walking different  
We smoke the competition  
We dope, we're on a mission  
No joke, this thing is real  
[chorus 2x]  
Make way for the crew, shout it  
We comin' through, shout it  
You know how we do, shout it  
We're makin' moves, shout it  
I know you feel this beat  
So bump it in the clubs  
And bang it in your Jeeps  
Cause you just can't get enough  
Listen close to what we say  
What we say, what we say  
We ain't coming just to play  
We've come to save the day  
[2x]  
Yo, we from the south, shout it  
Gonna make you bounce, shout it  
It's mister deal and now it's even what you think whatay  
My jiggle, my Burberry frick it don't matter  
When it come to the home beat pitcher, holla back  
If you really wanna get down whatcha like  
Can i get a witness, in the bars it's pitching  
Shout it, we gonna represent  
Shout it, cause we heaven sent  
[chorus 4x]

I know you walk around this life without hope  
Just tryin' to figure out a way you can cope, well  
You do so many things to escape your fears  
That you will never make it  
You'll always have to fake being happy  
I know the truth you can believe it or not  
There's a way out of this way of living  
But your trust must be giving willingly  
Someone to rescue you from all your disgrace  
Who will show you all his mercy, love and grace  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
I know you wonder what your life's all about  
When it comes to your future, you have your doubts  
There's only one who can make you feel secure  
Who will lead you through this life  
Where you'll spend eternity you can be sure  
You think the only heaven you'll ever know  
Is the little bit of blue sky you see when your troubles  
Seem to go for a little while  
There's a lasting pleasure, a fuller measure of joy and peace  
When you look inside and know you've been set free  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
You think the only heaven you'll ever know  
Is the little bit of blue sky you see when your troubles  
Seem to go for a little while  
There's a lasting pleasure, a fuller measure of joy and peace  
When you look inside and know you've been set free, free  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you than it seems if you'll only believe  
More than you know  
More than you could ever dream  
There's so much more  
Waiting for you  
If you just let it go  
If you just let it go  
It's waiting just for you  
If you open up your eyes  
If you realize, it's waitin' for you  

[Rap by Knowdaverbs:]  
I remember begging my mom for these Z. Cavarricci's  
With a striped genera shirt just to rock with these brutini's  
I begged and I begged, of course she said no  
So I committed to cutting grass just to conjour up the dough  
With a little extra change I'll cut a slope and a fade  
I'll be the freshest of the men in the midst of ninth grade  
It's crazy how we place these small things as important  
While the monument's reminding us of washed up Jordan's  
Rivers that is, not the be -ball player, told the mountains to  
Move and now there's no more Himalayas  
Had to set the devil straight since he was highly overrated  
Spoke and mountains moved and then the Alps disintegrated  
Racing through the fire I perspire like He times me  
And cross the finish line to realize that He's refined me  
Can't wait for morning breaks as joy turns from sorrow  
Busting victory laps around mount Kilimajarro  
Oh, we've made it this far and there's no turning back now  
With all of the joy deep inside  
We'll be praising His name, clapping hands while we're singing  
And dancing 'til the morning light, that's right, that's right  
Weight upon my shoulders, held a burden and they thought  
I'd never make it over, so I had to prove them wrong  
I never stopped believing, not a doubt in my mind  
The blessings I'm receiving, have cast the fears aside, yeah  
Wasn't easy, I got to let you know, had a lot to overcome  
But He loves me, he showed me the way to go  
Feels like life has just begun  
  
[Rap by Coffee:]  
I'm a scream from the rooftops, freckled face figment, light  
Complected pigment, least expected remnant, over flooding  
Supercharged enlarged freshly gutted, surgically removed was  
The flesh Jesus cut it. Was allotted when I got it, most  
Happiest, most joyful, vibrant, vibrating, dance around  
Illustrating. My matrix, a labyrinth, a maze, a holographic image,  
No end to my phonographic limits. If you've seen it once you've seen  
It twice, propelling, stopping swelling by applying bags of ice  
I'm open, before receiving Christ in darkness groping, Proverbs 4  
The focus of the diagnosis spoken made the decision to collision  
With incision self division multiplying and relying, sinful dying  
Cling to vision thank God in all I do, uh-uh, thank God in all I do  
Can't entrap me and I'm happy born anew  
Won't be easy, I've got to let you know  
There's a lot to overcome  
But He loves you, He'll show you the way to go  
You will feel like life has just begun  
  
[Rap by Bonified:]  
I got to keep moving and never carry the weight  
Trying to do it myself instead of walking in faith  
Leaving the rest to Him, giving my best to Him  
And put my flesh to death without a breath to take  
Had to battle the beats and overcame defeat  
Another factor of the seven from the garden of Eden  
Bonafied a true survivor of the wilderness  
Blessed beyond I gotta move on I gotta move on  
If you want to dance with me  
Now's your chance to be totally set free  
If you're in the groove  
And you know God is seeing you through  
Better make your move

Can you just give me a second please?  
I would like to give my testimony  
How the Lord has met my every need  
How he saved me, made me holy  
If you want to know the reason why  
I gave it all, this life's no longer mine  
How He made a way kept me alive  
Well, listen close as I testify  
You don't know like I know  
You can't tell it like I can tell it  
Everything the Lord has done for me so  
That you understand, I'm just gonna say it  
(What matter of love is this)  
(That the Father gives to us)  
How he saved my soul  
I want the world to know  
So know I sing  
Just want to sing His praise  
Loving kindness everyday  
Faithfulness that come my way  
I'm gonna clap my hands  
Please excuse me if I start to dance  
'Cause His love is true, His mercies new  
He's been so good to me  
He didn't have to do it but I'm glad He did  
Saved me from my sin  
That old life is gone and new life lives within  
(Of all the things that I could, I write a song)  
I knew I couldn't go wrong  
If I sang of His goodness all day long  
You don't know like I know  
You can't tell like I can tell it  
Everything the Lord has done for me so  
That you understand I'm just gone say it  
(I cannot live my life without Him)  
I made no excuse, if I get a little crazy  
In Him I live and more  
So know I sing  
Just want to sing His praise  
Loving kindness everyday  
Faithfulness that come my way  
I'm gonna clap my hands  
Please excuse me if I start to dance  
'Cause His love is true, His mercies new  
He's been so good to me  
So clap your hands this evening  
Come on y'all said it's alright  
Move a little this evening  
Come on y'all I said it's alright  
Who the Son sets free  
You know is free indeed, you're free  
You've got the need to be praisin'  

I tuned in to the tv once again today  
Watch the news to educate my mind  
The destruction and the chaos that confronted me  
It's our world caught in it's own demise  
(As I sat there I began to cry)  
The situation worsens every day that goes by  
(And I thought how can this be, Lord why)  
So heavy on me all those that are hurting inside  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
Sometimes life it seems a bit too much for me  
More things we must survive on top of all that we had before  
Broken hearts, broken homes, kids abused left alone  
So many in the streets, homeless with no food to eat  
(I know God hears us crying out)  
Run to Him for all the answers, don't turn away  
(If we look to Him there is no doubt)  
He'll give us all the help we need, he knows the way, still if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes  
  
There are so many troubles, God knows what we need to do  
He has us in His hands, knows what we are going through  
Silver and gold have I none, what I have I give to you  
His word says we can make it and I know His word is true  
Here's to the hurting souls and for all the broken hearts  
All those who've been abused, who's life has been torn apart  
I don't have all the answers, what I have I gladly give  
It's in him there is life, if in him we live and if I  
  
If I had a dollar for every heart that's broken  
For every word of love unspoken  
For every childhood dream that's never realize  
If I had a penny for all the wrong we're doing  
And all the ways we could be moving on  
Maybe I could buy you paradise  
Just to see some hope in your eyes

Little sarah jane ran away from home  
Fourteen and pregnent she was all alone  
Couldn't run from wrong, and was gonna be sent away  
Walkin' with her black and blue eyes full tears  
The burden that she carries much to old for her years  
Looking at her face would confirm your worst fears  
But instead she goes unnoticed  
Sarah Jane another girl who is dying inside  
You'd think that someone would stop  
But we hide, to intent on completing our day  
And she's left there to say  
Chorus:  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street watching you  
You could help me  
But your not looking  
I bet you would if only you knew  
You could make a difference  
Do you hear me?  
Can you see me?  
Walking down the street needing you  
I want to make it  
How can I get there?  
If you showed me that you cared, you know  
You could make the difference  
He's left to watch the world from the fifteenth floor  
Alone with the reminder, don't go out anymore  
You know those boys are trouble here in our neighborhood  
But you're my boy and you've got the chance to be something good  
Still the call of the streets was too much to ignore  
Now he's caught up in the game and can't find an open door  
He's a good boy gone bad and he's trying to get out  
But everybody's too afraid to hear what he's talking about  
Marcus Brown, lives a life much too old for his age  
If no one responds, he'll be words on a page  
Another statistic cause no calls were made  
To check on the boy who was missing from the fifth grade  
Chorus  
Bridge  
Everywhere you turn there's hurting people passing by  
Its such a shame that we could change a life but we don't try  
To look outside out world

Chorus:  
Why is that smile upon your face  
When it's such a rainy day  
Why are you so happy?  
What do you know that I don't know?  
I wish I did but aint been told  
So tell me, what's your secret?  
I met a girl the other day at the supermarket  
Ringing up all of my things  
She had the strangest look upon her face  
Wish you could have been there  
Just to see the way she looked at me  
Thought I must look crazy something out of place  
But paid it no attention  
Just kept going with my business  
I looked up because she stepped into my space  
Saw pain in her eyes  
Her question took me by surprise she said  
I didn't have the faintest clue where to begin  
So I asked some questions (just to see what I was dealing with)  
She told me where she was and where it was she'd been  
What an awful tale life hadnt done her well  
She had thoughts of leaving  
Bridge:  
(Before you go) let me tell my story  
(Once like you, you know) all guts and no glory  
(But now I have joy) the reason why  
Whos in my life  
That is why you're asking me  
See the moral of the story is the whole worlds watching you  
So be careful what you say and be careful what you do  
Never know when it will be your time to show someone the way  
So be a guiding light and shine so they'll say

Ohhh... Yeah  
I should have stopped, looked and listened before I proceeded  
But caution I threw to the wind  
Manyve been placed in my life to help lead me and guide me  
But I didn't want to talk to them  
So I ignored their advice and I tried to disguise pain from you and all the
things you did  
The wrong road was chosen my heart has been broken  
Cause I didn't want to hear them  
Shoulda said what I didn't say  
Shoulda went right but I went left that day  
Shoulda prayed but instead I strayed  
Shoulda gone a different way  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
I had the chance to advance and it seemed like the best  
Opportunity that I could get  
I didn't bother to see if my people agreed  
Maybe I knew what they would say and yet  
I didn't control it I kept going for it  
When I shoulda known it wasn't in Gods plan  
Had to let go, had I listened before  
I wouldve said no from the door  
Shoulda said what I didn't say  
Shoulda went right but I went left that day  
Shoulda stayed but instead I strayed  
Shoulda gone a different way  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened to my mother  
When she said that you were no good for me  
Shoulda listened to my pastors  
When they told me turn around and leave you be  
Shoulda listened to my sisters  
When they said that I was too blind to see  
But I see the light somehow  
And I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened I know I shoulda listened  
But I know that I vow to listen now  
Shoulda listened I know I shoulda listened  
But you don't have to tell me twice I'm going to listen now  
Shoulda listened if only I had listened  
But I've learned my lesson now  
I'm gonna listen now  
Shoulda listened cause I just can't be missing  
All the things God has for me  
Repeat till end

Yo, I don't appreciate you telling me  
The way that I should live  
No, I think the choices you've laid out for me  
The end is negative  
So, take all your imagery and ideology  
Yes I'll be fine  
When you go I'd rather not display my physical  
I'd rather use my mind, oh  
You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby  
Hey, it seems a shame to me I've been reduced  
To an object of lust and hate  
No way, please understand that I refuse to be  
Simply a height and weight  
This day, somewhere we've lost the value  
Of what a woman is supposed to be  
A queen, respected and defined by her creator  
Size 24, size 10 or size 3  
You act like all I am to be is, just a sexy, sexy thing  
Just a showpiece for all to see like a Bently or your diamond ring  
I know that I am more than that, don't believe the hype  
The One who made the stars and sun gave meaning to my life  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby  
It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride  
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl  
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me  
It's my choice and I will decide, I won't let you destroy my pride  
I'm no showpiece for you to hide and lose all that I am inside  
God made me and I'm beautiful, I won't dress like that kind of girl  
Are-E-S-P-E-see-T, see, that's the way that you got to look at me  
Oh, I don't need you to define my be-E-A-you-T-why  
I'd rather draw the line  
Oh, I don't need you on my team, what you're selling's a pipe dream  
And I don't need it, baby  

If I had been You I would have left  
Said there's nothing else that I can do  
But You saw somethig deep inside of me  
I had no idea but I was crying for you  
Didn't have to make the sacrifice  
Didn't have to come and save my life  
Didn't have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely I'm not worthy  
Didn't have to give all that You gave  
No way I could ever walk away  
Here's the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy  
I can't believe You've chosen to reveal  
Never ending mercy towards a heart that's been so faithless  
The fact that You want to show Yourself to me  
My knees grow weak can hardly speak  
For your love has been relentless  
Didn't have to make the sacrifice  
Didn't have to come and save my life  
Didn't have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely I'm not worthy  
Didn't have to give all that You gave  
No way I could ever walk away  
Here's the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy  
How can I repay You for the things that You've done for me  
Dear God  
I call to You  
Make me more like You  
My way to say thank You  
Is do all that you say  
Didn't have to make the sacrifice  
Didn't have to come and save my life  
Didn't have to pay the price for me  
Sincerely I'm not worthy  
Didn't have to give all that You gave  
No wayi could everwalk away  
Here's the only thing that I can say  
Yours truly thou art worthy

I see you watching me  
Yeah, you know I'm on it  
See how I'm living  
You know I'm too strong  
All they throw at me  
I'm not fallin' for it  
They think I'm alone  
They've got it all wrong  
  
Everybody on the left and everybody on the right  
Who's not scared to testify (willing to testify)  
Gotta let the world know it  
That you're not afraid to show it  
If you're not afraid to show it  
Let me hear you tonight  
  
[Chorus:Repeat x2]  
All my people in the place  
You're looking good with style and grace  
But here's my question, listen clear  
Where my soldiers (right here)  
Say hey (hey)  
If you know you keep it tight  
Say hey (hey)  
Where my soldiers at (right here)  
  
The world's watching you  
What'cha gonna do now  
Will you make a move  
Will you show and prove  
In all that you do  
Gotta represent  
The life that we've been given  
The reason why we're living so  
  
Everybody on the left and everybody on the right  
Who's not scared to testify (willing to testify)  
Gotta let the world know it  
That you're not afraid to show it  
If you're not afraid to show it  
Let me hear you tonight  
  
[Chorus]  
  
All my people in the place (repeat)  
  
Well, you know there's a reason  
We're here to change the world  
And you know I'm believing  
We can do it but it's up to you  
The request of the maker  
Of the ocean and the sky so blue  
It's a call for some soldiers  
So if you're not afraid to take a stand  
Then let me see you raise your hand  
  
[Chorus]

I, I can feel the Spirit when it moves down in my soul  
As it comes to make me whole  
I said I, I can feel the power as it washes over me  
As it comes to set me free  
Said I, I glow, nothing can erase the healing  
Nothing can replace the feeling  
Said I, I know there's a real move deep inside  
And it's too divine to hide, say  
If you open up your heart, open your mind  
If you give it all away, what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power you'll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing, what your eyes will see?  
If you're ready when the Spirit moves  
I, I can feel the Spirit  
When we bow our heads in prayer  
Let the Lord just take us there  
And I know, ain't nothin' quite the same  
As the fire that's in the place  
When we call upon His name, I'm telling you  
(Can't run and you can't hide)  
No need to try at all  
(It'll bring a change inside)  
When the anointing falls  
(Don't need no other high)  
Can't get no higher, I know  
(Don't let it pass you by)  
Let the Lord take control  
If you open up your heart, open your mind  
If you give it all away, what you will find?  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power you'll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing, what your eyes will see  
If you're ready when the Spirit moves  
If you open up your heart, open your mind  
If you give it all away, what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power you'll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing, what your eyes will see  
If you're ready when the Spirit moves  
Ooh and when the Spirit falls, hear Him call  
You know you should answer, go ahead and let go  
Let God take control of your soul  
Know there's nothing better when the Spirit falls, let go  
Let God just take control  
You know you should answer 'cause you  
(You can't run and you can't hide)  
No need to try at all  
(It'll bring a change inside)  
When the anointing falls  
(Don't need no other high)  
Can't get no higher, I know  
(Don't let it pass you by)  
Let the Lord take control  
If you open up your heart, open your mind  
If you give it all away, what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power you'll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing, what your eyes will see  
If you're ready when the Spirit moves  
If you open up your heart, open your mind  
If you give it all away, what you will find?  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power you'll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing, what your eyes will see  
If you're ready when the Spirit moves  
If you open up your heart, open your mind  
If you give it all away, what you will find  
Throw your hands in the air and close your eyes  
And you can never get enough  
Of the love and the power you'll receive  
When you fall down and you hit your knees  
So amazing, what your eyes will see  
If you're ready when the Spirit moves  

We search for outside conclusions to questions we have inside  
We search for logical solutions to problems we cannot hide  
We hope and pray the curse of war will be undone  
And that the world will be as one  
But we can't change it on our own, it takes more  
Chorus:  
Then and only then can we live in perfect harmony  
Only if and when we sacrifice our comfort for the least of these  
Get together down on our knees and pray God give us peace  
Then and only then  
We need to stop looking on ourselves and look to the One who know all  
He has the answers that can rebuild us, a foundation that will not fall  
We hope and pray the curse of hate will be no more  
But it may be different  
At least we know what the power of prayer is for, let's unite  
(chorus)  
We know it's gonna take time to get it together, to follow it through  
But if we try a little bit harder, just think what we could do  
If we only knew  
(chorus out)  

CHORUS

There are times in our lives  
When we all feel inside  
Something's wrong, there's gotta be  
Something better for me  
So we try on our own  
To change our paths  
But we don't realize that joy comes after rain  
And Life begins again  
  
Tomorrow

Tomorrow  
You will see the way  
When God is by your side to stay

Can be swayed so easily  
Doubt can come in my mind

But I've got to keep on goin', got to keep on movin'  
Got to keep on pressing it through  
'Cause I know my God is able, oh He's more than able

Has enough love to take good care of you

He knows of everything you're goin' though  
Has enough love to take good care of you  
You know exactly what you need to do  
So just keep movin'

There's another world inside of me  
That you may never see  
There's secrets in this life  
That I can't hide  
Somewhere in this darkness  
There's a light that I can't find  
Maybe it's too far away...  
Maybe I'm just blind...  
Maybe I'm just blind...  
  
So hold me when I'm here  
Right me when I'm wrong  
Hold me when I'm scared  
And love me when I'm gone  
Everything I am  
And everything in me  
Wants to be the one  
You wanted me to be  
I'll never let you down  
Even if I could  
I'd give up everything  
If only for your good  
So hold me when I'm here  
Right me when I'm wrong  
You can hold me when I'm scared  
You won't always be there  
So love me when I'm gone  
Love me when I'm gone...  
  
When your education x-ray  
Can not see under my skin  
I won't tell you a damn thing  
That I could not tell my friends  
Roaming through this darkness  
I'm alive but I'm alone  
Part of me is fighting this  
But part of me is gone  
  
So hold me when I'm here  
Right me when I'm wrong  
Hold me when I'm scared  
And love me when I'm gone  
Everything I am  
And everything in me  
Wants to be the one  
You wanted me to be  
I'll never let you down  
Even if I could  
I'd give up everything  
If only for your good  
So hold me when I'm here  
Right me when I'm wrong  
You can hold me when I'm scared  
You won't always be there  
So love me when I'm gone  
  
Maybe I'm just blind...  
  
So hold me when I'm here  
Right me when I'm wrong  
Hold me when I'm scared  
And love me when I'm gone  
Everything I am  
And everything in me  
Wants to be the one  
You wanted me to be  
I'll never let you down  
Even if I could  
I'd give up everything  
If only for your good  
So hold me when I'm here  
Right me when I'm wrong  
You can hold me when I'm scared  
You won't always be there  
So love me when I'm gone  
Love me when I'm gone...  
  
Love me when I'm gone  
When I'm Gone  
When I'm Gone  
When I'm Gone

God has given me a window
